HANDOFFS IN A MESHED WIRELESS SYSTEM CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is related to and claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional application No. 60/691,869, filed on June 16, 2005, entitled "Handoff in a Meshed Wireless System."<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]    The present disclosure relates generally to telecommunications, and more<br>
particularly, to handoffs in a meshed wireless system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In conventional wireless communications, an access network is generally used to connect any number of access terminals to a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet or a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The access network is typically implemented with multiple fixed-site access points dispersed throughout a geographic region. The geographic region is generally divided into cells. Each access point is configured to provide a point of access to a WAN for access terminals in a cell.<br>
[0004] A meshed wireless system is formed by a number of access points that join together to connect access terminals to a WAN. Data between an access terminal and the wide area network is routed from one access point to another until the data reaches a wired access point. A wired access point connects the access points to the rest of the WAN. The access points can route the data through the meshed wireless system to accommodate varying traffic demands, handoffs, and access point failures.<br>
[0005] As an access terminal roams through the meshed wireless system, it may require hand off from a serving access point to a target access point. As part of the handoff procedure, the connection between the access terminal and the WAN is rerouted through the meshed wireless system to the target access point. However, because of the delay through the meshed wireless system, some of the data transmitted by the WAN to the serving access point may be in transit through the meshed wireless system when the access terminal hands off to the target access point. As a result, data may be lost during handoff.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the invention.<br>
[0027] In the following detailed description, various concepts will be described in the context of a meshed wireless system. While these concepts are well suited for this application, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that these concepts are likewise applicable to other access networks. Accordingly, any reference to a meshed wireless system is intended only to illustrate these concepts, with the understanding the such concepts have a wide range of applications.<br>
[0028] FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating an example of a cluster in a meshed wireless system. A "cluster" is a number of access points joined together to connect one or more access terminals to a WAN.  The cluster 102 includes an access<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br>
point 104a having a wired backhaul connection to a WAN 106, such as the Internet. The access point 104a will be referred to as a "clusterhead." The cluster 102 is also shown with four additional fixed-site access points 104b-104e dispersed through the geographic coverage region, but may include any number of access points depending on the distance the cluster 102 must cover and the nature of the terrain. In an alternative embodiment of the cluster 102, the access points may be mobile. By way of example, an access point may be integrated into each access terminal carried by a user on foot or in a vehicle, aircraft or ship.<br>
[0029] The meshed wireless system is created by establishing radio links between the access points. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the clusterhead 104a has a radio link with access points 104b, 104c, respectively. The access point 104b also has a radio link with access point 104d, 104e. The wireless technology used to support the radio links may vary depending on the specific application and the overall design constraints imposed on the overall system. By way of example, the radio links can be implemented using World Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), infrared protocols such as Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth(r) technology, ultra wide band (UWB) protocol, home radio frequency (HomeRF), Ethernet compatibility alliance (WECA), wireless fidelity alliance (Wi-Fi Alliance), 802.11 network technology, private wireless communications network, land mobile radio network, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), or any other suitable wireless technology, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0030] An access terminal 110 is shown moving through the meshed wireless system by a series of broken lines. The access terminal 110 may be a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a data transceiver, a pager, a camera, a game console, a modem, or any other suitable wireless device. The access terminal 110 may use the meshed wireless system to connect to the WAN 106. Once connected, data can be routed through the meshed wireless system from one access point to another until the data reaches its destination. In what follows, "downstream" means in the direction of the access terminal 110 and "upstream" means in the direction of the clusterhead 104a. Each access point in the data path stores data flowing downstream to the access<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br>
terminal 110. Data is stored even after it has been forwarded, and data is stored even if the access point is not presently on the shortest path to the access terminal 110. In a manner to be described in greater detail later, the data stored by the access points may be used to facilitate the handoff of the access terminal 110 to another access point.<br>
[0031] The access terminal 110 is shown initially in communication with the access point 104d. This access point 104d is referred to as a "serving" access point because it serves as a connection point to the meshed wireless system for the access terminal 110. In this configuration, the WAN 106 delivers higher layer packets, such as IP packets, destined for the access terminal 110 to the clusterhead 104a. The clusterhead 104a converts the higher layer packets into physical layer frames for routing through the meshed wireless system. The physical layer frames are routed to the access point 104b, referred to as an "intermediate access point." The intermediate access point 104b stores the physical layer frames before routing them to the serving access point 104d for delivery to the access terminal 110.<br>
[0032] The access terminal 110 uses stamps added to, or in the physical layer frames to determine the playback sequence. The playback sequence is defined as the ordering of the higher layer packet stream sent to the application for processing. In the case where each physical layer frame contains a single higher layer packet, the stamp may be a sequence number added to the packet by a communications source, such as a TCP sequence number or a RTP playback timestamp. In the case where a higher layer packet is fragmented into multiple frames, or where multiple packets are consolidated into a single frame, the stamp is an additional field added to each frame by the clusterhead 104a.<br>
[0033] The routing scenario just described above assumes that the physical layer frame format is the same throughout the meshed wireless system. However, as a practical matter, mis may not always be the case. In at least one embodiment of the cluster 102, the physical layer frame format may change as the data travels down the meshed wireless system. In this embodiment, each access point 104b, 104d reframes the data before routing it downstream. The process of refraining data will be described in connection with FIGS. 2 and 3. In this case, the stamp used by the access terminal to determine the playback sequence is an additional field added to each frame by the serving access point 104d.<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br>
[0034] FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for converting higher layer packets received by the clusterhead into physical layer frames. In this example, a higher layer packet 202 is fragmented into three physical layer frames 202a-202c by the clusterhead. The first frame 202a contains PI bytes, the second frame 202b contains P2 bytes, and the third frame 202c contains P3 bytes. The clusterhead then adds a stamp 204a-204c, respectively, to each frame 202a-202c. The stamp is used downstream to reassemble the packet. The stamp may also be used for duplicate detection and frame reordering.<br>
[0035] In one embodiment, the stamp may signify where the first byte in the frame is located within the packet stream . By way of example, the clusterhead may stamp the first frame 202 a with n, indicating that the first byte in the first frame 202a is the nth byte in the packet stream . Since the first frame 202a has PI bytes, the second frame will be stamped by the clusterhead with (n+Pl), indicating that the first byte in the second frame 202b is the (n+Pl) byte in the packet stream . Since the second frame 202b has P2 bytes, the third frame 202c will be stamped by the clusterhead with (n+Pl+P2), indicating that the first byte in the third frame 202c is the (n+Pl+P2) byte in the packet stream . Alternatively, the stamp can be a number that is incremented by one for each frame in the sequence. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that any suitable stamping technique may be used to implement the meshed wireless systems described throughout this disclosure. The packet stream identified by the stamp may be associated with one application or many, and there may be a stream identifier in the frame to allow many separate streams sent to an access terminal at once.<br>
[0036] FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for refraining data at an access point downstream from the clusterhead. In this example, the access point uses the stamps 204a-204c to reassemble the packet 202. Once reassembled, the access point frames a block of data 202a' from the reassembled packet 202, adds a stamp 204a' to the frame, and queues up the frame for routing downstream. The access point also maintains a pointer 206. In this example, the pointer 206 identifies the byte in the packet stream when the next frame begins. By way of example, before the data block 202a' is framed, the pointer 206 is set to x, indicating that the first byte in the data block is the Xth byte in the packet stream . Using the pointer, the access point frames a data block having Fl bytes beginning with the Xth byte in the packet stream .  The pointer<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br>
206 is then set to (x+Fl), indicating the first byte in the packet stream for the next frame to be created by the access point.<br>
[0037] Returning to FIG. 1, the access terminal 110 is shown moving away from the serving access point 104d by a series of broken lines. As the access terminal 110 continues along this path, it will eventually be handed off to the access point 104e. This access point 104e is referred to as the "target" access point because it is the target of the handoff. As will be explained in greater detail shortly, the intermediate access point 104b facilitates the handoff by communicating to the target access point 104e the connection state between the serving access point 104d and the access terminal 110 when the handoff occurs. The "connection state" includes any information that an access point can use to determine the data in the meshed wireless system that remains to be delivered to an access terminal following handoff. By way of example, the connection state may be the pointer maintained by the serving access point 104d and/or the stamp of a frame. Alternatively, the connection state may be the actual data in the meshed wireless system that remains to be delivered to the access terminal 110 following handoff.<br>
[0038] In one embodiment of the cluster 102, the handoff is initiated from the target access point 104e by sending a "data request" upstream to the first access point storing the data. In this example, the data request is sent by the target access point 104e to the intermediate access point 104b. The intermediate access point 104b sends an instruction to the serving access point 104d to cease any further delivery of frames to the access terminal 110, and send the pointer. The intermediate access point 104b uses the pointer to identify the data from storage that remains to be routed to the access terminal 110. This data is framed by the intermediate access point 104b and routed to the target access point 104e as the connection state. The data is reframed at the target access point 104e and delivered to the access terminal 110 following handoff.<br>
[0039] Alternatively, the intermediate access point 104b can retrieve a stamp from the serving access point 104d if the physical layer frame format is the same throughout the cluster 102. In response to the data request from the target access point 104e, the intermediate access point 104b can retrieve either the stamp for the last frame delivered to the access terminal 110, the stamp for the next frame awaiting delivery to the access terminal 110, or any other stamp that allows the intermediate access point 104d to<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br>
determine the first frame for delivery from the target access point 104e to the access terminal 110 following handoff. The intermediate access point 104b uses the stamp to route the appropriate frames from storage to the target access point 104e as the connection state. The frames are delivered by the target access point 104e to the access terminal 110 following handoff.<br>
[0040] hi another embodiment of the cluster 102, the target access point 104e overhears and stores the data routed from the clusterhead 104a to the serving access point 104d prior to handoff. In some embodiments of the cluster 102, the access terminal 110 maintains an active set of access points in its vicinity. All access points in the access terminal's active set listens on the backhaul for data delivered to the serving access point 104d. In this example, the target access point 104e can either hear the transmission from the intermediate access point 104b to the serving access point 104d, or the intermediate access point 104b intentionally sends the data to both the serving and target access points 104d, 104e, respectively. .<br>
[0041] In other embodiments of the cluster 102, the access point 104e listens on the backhaul for data delivered to the access terminal 110 by one or more access points 104a, 104b, 104d, and stores this data even if it is not in the active set of access terminal 110.)<br>
[0042] When a handoff of the access terminal 110 from the serving access point 104d to the target access point 104e is initiated, the target access point 104e sends a "state request" upstream to the first access point storing the data, i.e., the intermediate access point 104b. The intermediate access point 104b sends an instruction to the serving access point 104d to cease any further delivery of frames to the access terminal 110 , and send the pointer. The intermediate access point 104b forwards the pointer to the target access point 104e. The target access point 104e uses the pointer to identify the data in storage that remains to be delivered to the access terminal 110. This data is framed by the target access point 104e for delivery to the access terminal 110 following handoff.<br>
[0043] If the same physical layer frame format is used throughout the cluster 102, the intermediate access point 104b may retrieve a stamp, rather than the pointer. The intermediate access point 104b forwards the stamp to the target access point 104e where it is used to pull from storage all frames that were not delivered by the serving access<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br><br>
point 104d to the access terminal 110. These frames are delivered to the access terminal 110 by the target access point 104e following handoff.<br>
[0044] Under certain conditions, the target access point 104e may be unable to store all the data destined for the access terminal 110. By way of example, the target access point 104e may be routing data downstream when the intermediate access point 104b is sending data to the serving access point 104d, or the target access point 104e may not be able to decode every frame because of various disturbances, such as noise and interference, in the radio path between the intermediate access point 104b and the target access point 104e. To deal with this situation, the target access point 104e may be configured to retrieve from the intermediate access point 104b, during handoff, the frames that it was unable to decode and still need to be sent to the access terminal 110. In this embodiment, the target access point 104e responds to a handoff by the access terminal 110 by sending both a data request and a state request to the intermediate access point 104b. The data request is limited to the frames that the target access point 104e was unable to decode. The intermediate access point 104b routes the requested frames to the target access point 104e so it can update its storage. At the same time, or thereabouts, the intermediate access point 104b sends an instruction to the serving access point 104d for the pointer or the stamp, and routes the same to the target access point 104e. Using the stamp or pointer, and the data in storage, the target access point 104e can pick up where the serving access point 104d left off following the handoff of the access terminal 110.<br>
[0045] In one embodiment of the cluster 102, the target access point 104e may listen for and store the data routed between the serving access point 104d to the access terminal 110 prior to handoff. The data stored by the target access point 104e may be useful for a number reasons. By way of example, the target access point 104e may be unable to retrieve the stamp or the pointer from the serving access point 104d in response to a state request. In that case, the target access point 104e can use the stored data to identify the data that remains to be delivered to the access terminal 110 following handoff. Alternatively, or in addition to, this data can be used for retransmission following handoff for any frames that were delivered by the serving access point 104d to the access terminal, but were not successfully decoded.<br><br>

[0046] FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram illustrating an example of an access point. The access point 104 may be a stand-alone entity or distributed across one or more entities within the cluster 102 (see FIG. 1). The access point 104 includes means for routing data received to an access terminal via a serving access point, depicted in FIG. 4 as a router 402. The access point 104 also includes means for communicating a connection state of the access terminal to a target access point during handoff, depicted in FIG. 4 as a controller 404.<br>
[0047] The access point 104 includes an upstream transceiver 406 to support a radio link on the backhaul. A downstream transceiver 408 is used to support a radio link with downstream access points, as well as access terminals in its wireless coverage region. Although the transceivers 406,408 are shown as separate entities, those skilled in the art will readily understand that the transceivers 406, 408 may be integrated together as single entity, or otherwise implemented in any suitable fashion.<br>
[0048] In the downstream direction, the router 402 uses routing information contained in the packet stream to determine the destination access terminal in the meshed wireless system. Once the destination access terminal is identified, the router 402 consults a routing table 410 to determine the serving access point for the destination access terminal or next hop access point and the best path to route the frame. In the case where the cluster includes multiple clusterheads, the router 402 also uses routing information in the packet stream to determine the destination clusterhead and consults the routing table 410 for the best path to route the frames. The router 402 uses standard protocols to communicate with other routers in the meshed wireless system to dynamically reconfigure the data paths in the mesh network to best manage traffic. .<br>
[0049] A frame buffer 412 is used to refrarne the data. As described in greater detail above, the frame buffer 412 reassembles the payload from the frames received by the upstream transceiver 406 and stores the payload in a data buffer 414. The frame buffer 412 also frames one or more blocks of data from the payload and attaches a stamp to each frame. For each frame routed by the frame buffer 412 through the downstream transceiver 408 , the frame buffer 412 moves the pointer.<br>
[0050] During handoff, the controller 404 is used to handle state and data requests from downstream access points. In response to a data request, the controller 404 uses the downstream transceiver 408 to retrieve the pointer or stamp from a serving access<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br><br>
point. The controller 404 uses the stamp or pointer to release the data from the data buffer 414 to the frame buffer 412. The controller 404 also prompts the router 402 to update the routing table 410 to accommodate the handoff of the access terminal to the target access point. The frame buffer 412 frames the data from the data buffer 414 and adds a stamp to each frame.<br>
[0051] In response to a state request, the controller 404 also retrieves the pointer or stamp from a serving access point. However, in the case of a state request, the controller 404 simply forwards the pointer or stamp to the target access point through the downstream transceiver 408.<br>
[0052] The controller 404 may also be used to facilitate handoff when the access point 104 is either a serving or target access point. In the case of a serving access point, the controller 404 communicates with the frame buffer 412 to disable the further framing of data and retrieve the pointer. The pointer retrieved from the frame buffer 412 is routed by the controller 404 to an intermediate access point through the upstream transceiver 406.<br>
[0053] In the case of a target access point, the controller 404 initiates handoff by either sending a data request or a state request to an intermediate access point. In response to a data request, the access point 104 will receive data from the intermediate access point via the upstream transceiver 406, retrieve routing information via the router 402 and routing table 410, reframe the data in the frame buffer 412, and deliver the frames to the access terminal through the downstream transceiver 408.<br>
[0054] Alternatively, as described in greater detail above, the access point 104 may listen on the backhaul for data transmitted from the intermediate access point to the serving access point prior to handoff. In this embodiment, the access point includes a means for detecting the data on the backhaul, depicted in FIG. 4 as the upstream transceiver 406, and means for storing the data, depicted in FIG. 4 as the data buffer 414. The controller 404 also provides means for receiving the handoff of the access terminal and means for routing data in the data buffer 414 to the access terminal.<br>
[0055] In this alternate embodiment, the controller 404 initiates handoff by sending a state request through the upstream transceiver 406 to the intermediate access point. Li response to the state request, the controller 404 will receive a pointer or stamp from the<br><br>
WO 2006/138575	PCT/US2006/023507<br>
intermediate access point via the upstream transceiver 406. The pointer of stamp is used by the controller 404 to release data from the data buffer 414 to the frame buffer 412. The frame buffer 412 frames the data, and the downstream transceiver 408 delivers the frames to the access terminal following handoff.<br>
[0056] FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating an example of a method of handing off an access terminal. In step 502, the data is routed to an access terminal via a first access point. In step 504, a connection state of the access terminal is communicated to a second access point if a handoff of the access terminal from the first access point to the second access point is requested.<br>
[0057] FIG. 6 is a functional block diagram illustrating an example of an access point. The access point 104 includes means for routing data to an access terminal via a first access point 602. The routing means 604 may be a router. The access point also includes means for communicating a connection state of the access terminal to a second access point if a handoff of the access terminal from the first access point to the second access point is requested 604. The communicating means 604 may be a controller.<br>
[0058] FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an example of a method of handing off an access terminal. In step 702, data being routed from a first access point to a second access point is detected while the second access point is communicatively coupled to an access terminal. In step 704, the data is stored in a buffer. In step 706, the access terminal is handed off to the access point. In step 708, at least a portion of the data in the buffer is routed to the access terminal.<br>
[0059] FIG. 8 is a functional block diagram illustrating an example of an access point. The access point 104 includes means for detecting data being routed from a first access point to a second access point communicatively coupled to an access terminal 802. The detecting means 802 may be a transceiver. The access point 104 also includes means for storing the data 804. The storing means 804 may be a buffer. The access point 104 also includes means for receiving a handoff of the access terminal 806. The receiving means 806 may be a controller. The access point 104 further includes means for routing to the access terminal at least a portion of the data in the buffer 808. The routing 808 means may be a router.<br><br>
