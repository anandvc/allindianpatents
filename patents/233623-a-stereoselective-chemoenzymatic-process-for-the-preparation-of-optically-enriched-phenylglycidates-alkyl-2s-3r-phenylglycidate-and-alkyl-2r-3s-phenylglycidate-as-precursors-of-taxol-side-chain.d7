				<td>The present invention relates to a stereoselective chemoenzymatic process for the preparation of optically enriched phenylglycidates i.e. alkyl(2S,3R)- phenylglycidate and alkyl(2R,3S)- phenylglycidate as precursors of taxol side chain.The invention particularly discloses a novel process for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of two enantiomers of trans alkyl phenylglycidate i.e.alkyl (2R,3S)- phenylglycidate and aikyi(2R,3S)-phenylglycidate of formulae 7 and 8 respectively, process of their synthesis comprises cohalogenation reaction of alkyl cinnamate of formula  1 where R' represents C-1 to C-5 alkyl group to form trans 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 2 where x represents Br or I, then converting the halohydrins of formula 2 to corresponding alkyl acylates of formula 3 where x and R' represents as above, subsequently incubating the acyl derivatives of alkyl 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 3 with crude dry powder of lipase f,om Aspergillus niger in an aqueous buffer phase in presence of an organic solvent, thereafter separating the hydrolysed halohydrins i.e. alky!(2R,3R) 2-haio-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 4 and unhydrolysed ester i.e. alkyl (2S,3S) 2-halo-3-acyloxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 5 from the mixture by conventional method, if required then again incubating the optically enriched acyl derivatives of formula 5 with crude dry powder of lipase from Aspergillus niger in an aqueous buffer phase in presence of an organic solvent to further improve the enantiopurity, followed by reaction of the optically enriched products of formula 5 with an  acid  to furnish  optically enriched  alkyl (2S.3S) 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoate of formula 6 and finally treating the compounds of formulae 4 and 6 with an alkali in an organic or aqueous phase to furnish optically enriched alkyl(2S,3R)-phenylglycidate and alkyl(2R,3S)-phenylglycidate of formulae 7 and 8 respectively .<br>
Use of lipase from Aspergillus niger for the kinetic resolution of trans alkyl 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates where x and R' represents as above is novel as also the step of acid followed by a base catalysed reaction for the cyclisation of resolved esters of trans alkyl 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 4 and 6, not reported in the art of its synthesis. Optically enriched alkyl(2S,3R)-phenylglycidate and alkyl(2R3S)-phenyl-glycidatd of formulae 7 and 8 are the key intermediates used in the synthesis of N-benzoyl-(2R,3S)-3-phenylisoserine  (Taxol   side  chain).   Paclitaxel  or Taxol<br><br>
which was isolated from the bark of the Pacific Yew (Taxus 5rewfo//a)(Wani et <br>
Taxol 10-Deacetyl baccatin-lll Isoserine<br>
various types of cancers( Holmes et al J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83, 1797-1805,1991).<br>
Despite being one of the most promising anti-cancer drugs, its very low<br>
occurrence (40-165 mg/kg) in nature is the main hindrance in its production.<br>
Fortunately it has been found that 10-deacetyl baccatin-lll which is structurally<br>
closely related to Taxol and occurs in comparatively higher concentrations<br>
(approx. 1g/kg), can be easily isolated from fresh leaves of European Yew<br>
(Taxus baccate). It is also reported that Paclitaxel is 1000 times more potent<br>
compared to 10-deacetyl baccatin-lll and its higher activity is due to a C-13 side<br>
chain comprising N-benzoyl-(2f?,3S)-3-phenylisoserine moiety (Wani et al J <br>
Therefore synthesis of optically active (2S.3R) and (2R,3S)-phenylglycidates of<br>
formula 7 and 8 which are the key chiral precursors for synthesising N-benzoyl-<br>
(2R,3S)-3-phenylisoserine has become very vital for the development of a<br>
practical and efficient route to synthesise enantiomerically pure isoserine chain .<br>
There are number of reports on the preparation of these chiral intermediates by<br>
biochemical or chemoenzymatic methods besides asymmetric syntheses. Most<br>
?f these reports are related to kinetic resolution of racemic 2-halo-3-hydroxy-<br>
phenylpropanoate through enzymatic hydrolysis ( H.Honig et al., Tetrahedron 46,<br>
3841-3850, 1990; Peter G. M Wuts et al, Tetrahedron Asymmetry 11, 2117-2123, 2000), or by transesterification reaction ( Ching-Shih Chen et al., J. Org. Chem. 58, 1287-1289, 1993; Ching-Shih Chen et al, U .S. Pat. No. 6,020,174, to The Board of Governors for Higher Education, Rhodes Island; Marco Villa et al., U.S.Pat. No. 6,187,936 to Zambon Group S.p.A; Tanebe JP 06/078790) or via resolution of azetidinones (C.J Sih et al., J. Org. Chem. 58, 1068-1075, 1993; R.N. Patel et al, J. American Oil Chemists Society, 73, 1363-1375, 1996; R. A. Holton et al, WO 2001029245, EP 1222305 to Bristol-Myers Squibb; R.N. Patel et al., Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry, 20, 23-33, 1994). From the literature review it is quite clear that no prior art is available on kinetic resolution of racemic 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates where x represents bromo and iodo groups and R' represents C-1 to C-5 alky group. Therefore the use of bromo and iodohydrins via kinetic resolution route for the preparation of desired (2S,3R) and (2R,3S)-phenylglycidates i n essentially n ovel a nd h as n ot been reported in the literature or known in the art of their synthesis of taxol side chain precursors.<br>
The present invention therefore discloses the application of a lipase for the preparation of (2S,3R) and (2R,3S)-phenylglycidates via kinetic resolution of halohydrin intermediates x and R' are defined as above.<br>
Thus the main objective of the present invention is to synthesise optically active alkyl   (2S,3R)   and   (2R,3S)-phenylglycidates   of   formulae   7   and   8   using chemoenzymatic approach through resolution of its racemic precursor trans alkyl 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 2 where x represents bromine or iodine and R' represenrts C-1 to C-5 alkyl group. Advantage of using bromo and iodohydrin intermediates are that they are easily preparable in almost quantitative   yields   and   are   obtained   in   crystalline   form.   Moreover  these compounds can be easily converted to corresponding epoxides (glycidates) by acid    and    base   catalysed   transformations   in   almost   quantitative   yields. Additionally use of lipase from Aspergillus niger makes the process of resolution of trans alkyl 2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates facile. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a stereoselective chemoenzymatic process for the preparation of optically enriched phenylglycidates i.e. alkyl(2S,3R)-phenylglycidate and alkyl(2R,3S)- phenylglycidate as precursors of taxol side chain. The steps involved are:<br><br>
a. Preparation of halohydrins of formula 2 where x represents bromine or<br>
iodine and R' represents C-1 to C-5 alkyl group, from corresponding alkyl<br>
cinnamates of formula 1 by the action of a halogenating agent.<br>
b. Chemical transformation of halohydrins of formula 2 to alkyl acylatesof<br>
formula 3 using an acyl anhydride in presence of a base.<br>
c. Incubating the trans alkyl 3-acyloxy-2-halo-3-phenylpropanoates of<br>
formula 3 with dry powder of the lipase from Aspergillus niger in an<br>
aqueous buffer phase in absence of an organic medium or in presence of<br>
an organic medium to facilitate the reaction. The bioresolution process is<br>
effected using the commercial enzyme lipase AMANO AS (Aspergillus<br>
niger) gifted by M/s AMANO, Japan and used directly without further<br>
purification or modification,<br>
d. Separating the hydrolysed alkyl(2R3R)-2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-<br>
phenylpropanoates of formula 4 and unhydrolysed alkyl(2S,3S)-3-<br>
acyloxy-2-halo-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 5 by conventional method<br>
of chromatography.<br>
e. Reacting the optically enriched hydrolysed alkyl(2ft,3/?)-2-halo-3-hydroxy-<br>
3-phenylpropanoates of formula 4 with a base to furnish alkyl (2S,3R)<br>
phenylglycidates of formula 7.<br>
f. Reaction of unhydrolysed alkyl(2S,3S)-3-acyloxy-2-halo-3-<br>
phenylpropanoates of formula 5 with an inorganic or organic acid to<br>
furnish corresponding alkyl(2S,3S)-2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates<br>
of formula 6. Further reacting the optically enriched hydrolysed<br>
alkyl(2S,3S)-2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 6 with a<br>
base to furnish alkyl(2R,3S) phenylglycidates of formula 8.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of preparation of halohydrins from alkyl<br>
:innamates of formula 1 to halohydrins of formula 2 in step 'a' of the process, the<br>
nalogenating agent is selected from N-halosuccinimide such as NDromosuccinimide,<br>
N-iodosuccinimide or sodium bromate, periodic acid, 1,3-<br>
Jibromo-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin, iodine, bromine and the like but more<br>
Dreferably sodium bromate for bromoh -Voxylation or periodic acid for '<br>
odohydroxylation in an aqueous phase or in a mixed organic aqueous phase<br>
where organic solvent may be selected from water miscible solvents such as<br>
acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile and the like. The formation of<br>
halohydrins is carried out at a temperature in the range of 0-60°C more<br>
preferably at 30-40°C. In step 'b' of the transformation of compound of formula <br>
to acyiate of formula 3, the acylating agent is selected from acyl anhydrides such<br>
as acetic anhydride; propionic anhydride and butyric anhydride or corresponding<br>
acyl chlorides but most suitable is acetic anhydride in presence of bases like<br>
pyridine, N,N-dimethyl aminopyridine (DMAP) and more preferably DMAP.<br>
In step 'c' of the process of kinetic resolution of the compound of formula 3 is<br>
effected by incubating the compound of formula 3 in presence of crude lipase<br>
enzyme (AS AMANO) from Aspergillus niger either in a buffered aqueous phase<br>
alone or a buffered aqueous phase in presence of an organic medium as a<br>
cosolvent which facilitates the hydrolytic reaction. The pH of the buffer is suitably<br>
adjusted at 5-7.5, more suitably at 6-7.5 and most suitably at 7. The temperature<br>
of the reaction is selected at 10-40°C, but more suitably at 20-35°C and most<br>
suitably at 30°C. The preferred aqueous phase is water, phosphate buffer (0.1M<br>
to 0.2M) or an acetate buffer and the most preferred one is phosphate buffer<br>
(0.1M). The preferred cosolvents that are added in the ratio of 10-90% are<br>
hexane, toluene, dichloromethane, acetone, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, ethanol and the like. The more preferable are<br>
toluene, acetone and acetonitrile and most preferable is acetonitrile.<br>
After the completion of the hydrolysis reaction in step 'd' of the process the<br>
separation of hydrolysed alcohol of formula 4 and unhydrolysed ester of formula<br>
5 is effected by column chromatography on silica gel columns by conventional<br>
chromatographic methods.<br>
In step 'e' of the process of base catalysed conversion of the compound of the<br>
formula 4 (hydrolysed ester) to alkyl(2S,3R)-phenylglycidates of the formula 7, is<br>
effected by an inorganic or organic base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate and the like and organic bases are selected from triethylamine,<br>
piperidine,1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-<br>
7-ene (UBU) and the like, the more preferred base is DBU.<br>
In step "f" of the process of acid catalysed conversion of the compound alkyl<br>
(2S,3S)-3-acyloxy-2-halo-3-phenylpropanoates of the formula 5 (unhydrolysed<br>
ester) first to alkyl(2S,3S)-2-halo-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoates of formula 6 is<br>
effected by mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid , sulfuric acid or an organic or<br>
lewis acid such as trifluoro acetic acid, boron trifiuoride (BFs) in an organic<br>
solvent such as diethyl ether, methanol, acetone and the like but the preferred<br>
acidic conditions are 1N, 2N and 5N HCI , most preferred is 2N HCI in methanol,<br>
finally transformation to alkyl(2R,3S)-phenylglycidates of the formula 8 is effected<br>
by a base as described in step 'e".<br>
