The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a nonpolar metal electrolytic capacitor in which an electric conductivity is significantly improved by applying a metal material, instead of a solid electrolyte and electrolyte of an aluminum electrolytic capacitor, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is used for a flow frequency bypass or<br>
a smoothing circuit of a power source. Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing<br>
the aluminum electrolytic capacitor will be briefly described.<br>
An etching process on an aluminum foil is performed to enlarge a surface area of<br>
the aluminum foil and thereby increase an electric capacity.  When the etching<br>
process is completed, a forming process of forming a dielectric substance on the<br>
aluminum foil is performed whereby cathode and anode aluminum foils are<br>
manufactured to be used for assembly of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor. When<br>
the etching process and the forming process are completed, a slitting process of<br>
cutting the completed aluminum foil and a separator by as long as a desired width<br>
based on the length of a product is performed.  When the slitting process is<br>
completed, a stitching process of stitching an aluminum lead patch, which is a<br>
lead terminal, to the aluminum foil is performed.<br>
When the slitting of the aluminum foil and the separator is completed, a winding<br>
process of disposing the separator between the anode aluminum foil and the cathode<br>
aluminum foil, and then winding the separator and the aluminum foils in a<br>
cylindrical shape and attaching a tape thereto, so as to not be unwounded. When<br>
the winding process is completed, an impregnation and curling process of disposing<br>
the wound device into an aluminum case, injecting an electrolyte, and curling the<br>
aluminum and a sealing material is performed.  When the curling process is<br><br><br>
completed, an aging process of restoring a damage to the dielectric substance is performed whereby assembly of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor is completed. Due to the current development in digitalization and thinness of electronic devices, when applying the conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor, there are some problems as follow.<br>
Since the aluminum electrolytic capacitor uses the electrolyte, an electric conductivity is comparatively low and thus there is some constraint on a long life of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor in a high frequency area. Also, there are some constraints on improvement of reliability, a high frequency response, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR), and impedance. Also, due to a comparatively high ripple pyrexia, there are some constraints on stability and environments, such as fuming and firing.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
The present invention is conceived to solve the above-described problems<br>
and thus provides a nonpolar metal electrolytic capacitor in which an electric<br>
conductivity is improved by about 10,000 to 1,000,000 folds by applying a metal<br>
material for an electrolyte, in comparison to when using a conventional electrolyte<br>
or an organic semiconductor, a nonpolar multi-layer metal electrolytic capacitor<br>
using the same, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a nonpolar metal electrolytic capacitor which<br>
can improve a thinness, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR), a reduction in<br>
a ripple pyrexia, a long life, a heat-resistant stability, non-fuming, non-firing,<br>
and environment by using a metal material for an electrolyte, a nonpolar<br>
multi-layer metal electrolytic capacitor using the same, and a manufacturing<br>
method thereof.<br><br><br>
The present invention also provides a nonpolar metal electrolytic capacitor which can be simply provided in a multi-layer by using a metal material for an electrolyte, which is impossible in a conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor structure, a nonpolar multi-layer metal electrolytic capacitor using the same, and a manufacturing method thereof. [Technical Solution]<br>

According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of manufacturing a nonpolar metal electrolytic capacitor, the method<br>
including: an etching process of arranging a plurality of grooves on both surfaces<br>
of a metal foil by using a direct current (DC) etching method; a forming process<br>
of forming a metal oxide film on the metal foil by using an anodic oxidation method<br>

foil via the seed electrode layer as a medium by using a plating method when the<br><br><br>
seed electrode layer is formed; a process of forming a lead terminal on the main electrode layer when the main electrode layer is formed; and a molding process of sealing the metal foil so that the lead terminal is externally protruded when the lead terminal is formed. [Advantageous Effects]<br>

In this instance, the seed electrode layer 13 or the main electrode layer 14 may use any one of aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), and gold (Au). Also, when the main electrode layer 14 is formed in the process of forming the main electrode layer 14, a process of forming a conductive adhesive layer 17 on the main electrode layer 14 may be further performed. In this instance, the conductive adhesive layer 17 is provided to improve an adhesive strength and is formed by using a solder paste, electroless plating or electrolytic plating.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, when the main electrode layer 14 is formed, a process of forming the lead terminal 15 on the main electrode layer 14 is performed.

Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing the nonpolar multi-layer metal electrolytic capacitor 100 according to the second embodiment will be described.<br>
In the method of manufacturing the nonpolar multi-layer metal electrolytic<br>
capacitor 100, an etching process of forming a plurality grooves 11a on both<br>
surfaces of a metal foil 11, formed of aluminum (Al), by using a direct current<br>
(DC) etching method through a process of forming a main electrode layer 14 to fill<br>
the plurality of grooves 11a formed on the metal foil 11 via the seed electrode<br>
layer 13 as a medium are the same as the manufacturing process of the nonpolar<br>
metal electrolytic capacitor according to the first embodiment, and thus will be<br>
omitted here.<br>
When the main electrode layer 14 is formed through the processes as shown<br><br><br>
in FIGS. 3A through 3F, a process of forming first to n metal electrolytic foils 10a, 10b, •••, lOn by cutting the metal foil 11 formed on the main electrode layer 14.

When forming the metal electrolytic foil multi-layer body 100a, the plurality of the first to the nth metal electrolytic foils 10a, 10b, •••, lOn may be formed by repeating the etching process through the process of forming the main electrode layer 14, or formed by using the plurality of metal electrolytic foils 10a, 10b, •••, lOn, which is formed by cutting the metal foil 11 including the main electrode layer 14, or the plurality of metal electrolytic foils 10a, 10b, •••, lOn, which is formed by repeating the etching process through the process of forming the main electrode layer 14.<br>
