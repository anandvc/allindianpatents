APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING PILOT SIGNAL IN<br>
A BWA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING TRANSMIT ANTENNAS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access<br>
(BWA) communication system, and more particularly to an apparatus and a<br>
method for transmitting pilot signals in a BWA communication system using a<br>
plurality of transmit antennas.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is the next<br>
generation communication system, research is being performed to provide users<br>
with services having various Qualities of Services (QoSs) at a high speed. In<br>
particular, in the current 4G communication system, research is being performed<br>
to support a high speed service for ensuring mobility and QoS in a BWA<br>
communication system, such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system<br>
and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system.<br>
Typical types of 4G communication system are an Institute of Electrical<br>
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16a/d communication system and an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. The IEEE 802.16a/d communication system and<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system utilize an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme/an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme that support a broadband transmission<br>
network for a physical channel of the wireless MAN system. The IEEE 802.16a/d<br>
communication system and the IEEE 802.16e communication system transmit<br>
mass storage data at a high speed using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme. The IEEE<br>
802.16a/d communication system considers only a single cell structure and<br>
stationary subscriber stations (SSs), i.e., the system does not accommodate the<br>
mobility of the SSs. However, the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
accommodates the mobility of an SS in the IEEE 802.16a communication system.<br>
Herein, an SS having the mobility will be referred to as a Mobile Station (MS).<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a conventional mini sub-channel structure<br>
of an IEEE 802.16d communication system using a Single Input Single Output<br>
(SISO) scheme. Because the IEEE 802.16d communication system uses the<br>
OFDMA scheme, the IEEE 802.16d communication system uses a plurality of<br>
sub-carriers and a plurality of sub-channels each of which comprises at least<br>
one sub-carrier.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a horizontal axis represents a time domain, a vertical<br>
axis represents a frequency domain, and one block occupied by the time domain<br>
and the frequency domain represents a tone, i.e., a sub-carrier. Herein, a<br>
frequency domain occupied by the sub-carrier will be referred to as a 'sub-<br>
frequency domain'. It is noted that the tone is used together with the sub-carrier<br>
for convenience of description.<br>
One mini sub-channel 101 comprises a predetermined number of tones,<br>
e.g., 18 tones. When the SISO scheme is used, the mini sub-channel 101<br>
comprises a predetermined number of pilot tones, e.g., two pilot tones 102 and<br>
103, for a channel estimation. The remaining tones excluding the pilot tones 102<br>
and 103 represent data tones.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the pilot tones 102 and 103 are located in central<br>
positions of the mini sub-channel 101 for the channel estimation. For example, a<br>
transmitter, e.g., a Base Station (BS), transmits the pilot tones 102 and 103, so<br>
that a receiver, e.g., an MS or plurality of MSs, can estimate radio channel<br>
conditions on the downlink.<br>
Because the mini sub-channel 101 comprises the two pilot tones 102<br>
and 103, a ratio of pilot tones with respect to the total tones is 1/9.<br>
As described above, the MSs estimate radio channel conditions using the<br>
pilot tones transmitted from the BS and demodulate received data according to<br>
the estimated radio channel conditions. Accordingly, estimating the radio channel<br>
conditions has a great influence on the entire system performance.<br>
The sub-channel, which is a basic unit of data transmission in the IEEE<br><br>
802.16d communication system, comprises three mini sub-channels.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to transmit a symbol including 48 tones through one<br>
sub-channel.<br>
The IEEE 802.16d communication system supports a multiple antenna<br>
scheme. In the multiple antenna scheme, a BS transmits signals through a<br>
plurality of transmit antennas. The multiple antenna scheme may be classified<br>
into a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) scheme and a Multiple Input<br>
Single Output (MISO) scheme according to the number of receive antennas used<br>
by MSs.<br>
It is generally known that the multiple antenna scheme has number of<br>
advantages. For example, the multiple antenna scheme transmits signals through a<br>
plurality of transmit antennas, so that the transmitted signals have a plurality of<br>
transmit paths. Therefore, it is possible to acquire transmit antenna diversity gain.<br>
Further, the multiple antenna scheme transmits signals through a plurality of<br>
transmit antennas, so that the transmitted signals have a plurality of transmit<br>
spaces. Therefore, it is possible to acquire spatial diversity gain by using a Spatial<br>
Multiplexing (SM) scheme.<br>
When the multiple antenna scheme is used as described above, it is<br>
possible to acquire the transmit antenna diversity gain and the spatial diversity<br>
gain. Accordingly, the multiple antenna scheme is used for efficiently transmitting<br>
information data. However, even though the multiple antenna scheme is used, the<br>
transmit antenna diversity gain and the spatial diversity gain may be varied<br>
according to actual radio channel conditions.<br>
Further, when the multiple antenna scheme is used as described above,<br>
the MS must precisely estimate radio channel conditions from each of the<br>
transmit antennas to the receive antenna of the MS in order to demodulate the<br>
signals transmitted from the BS through each of the transmit antennas because it<br>
is possible to acquire the transmit antenna diversity gain and the spatial diversity<br>
gain only through the precise estimation of the radio channel conditions. In the<br>
conventional wireless communication system, the radio channel conditions are<br>
estimated using pilot signals.<br><br>
However, when the transmit antennas are used as described above,<br>
transmit paths experienced by the signals transmitted through each of the transmit<br>
antennas may be varied. Therefore, radio channels experienced by the signals<br>
transmitted through each of the transmit antennas may also be varied. Accordingly,<br>
it is possible to achieve the precise radio channel estimation only when the<br>
precise identification of the transmit antennas is possible. In addition, it is<br>
possible to precisely demodulate received signals through the precise radio<br>
channel estimation. More specifically, because pilot signals are used for the radio<br>
channel estimation differently from general information data, the identification of<br>
the transmit antennas becomes more and more important.<br>
In order to identify the transmit antennas, the mini sub-channel 101 must<br>
transmit pilot signals through each of the transmit antennas at different positions.<br>
However, in order to transmit the pilot signals through each of the transmit<br>
antennas, it is necessary to reduce the amount of transmittable data. As a result, as<br>
the number of the transmit antennas increases, the amount of transmittable data<br>
reduces.<br>
For example, when one transmit antenna is used, one mini sub-channel<br>
101 uses only two pilot tones 102 and 103 and can transmit data using the remaining tones, i.e., the data tones, as described in FIG. 1. However, when two<br>
transmit antennas, i.e., a first and a second transmit antenna, are used, it is<br>
impossible to transmit data through the second transmit antenna in a tone<br>
identical to the tone transmitting pilot signals through the first transmit antenna.<br>
As described above, the amount of transmittable data is reduced as the number of<br>
the transmit antennas increases, thereby decreasing the total system transmission<br>
capacity. Consequently, the entire system quality may deteriorate.<br>

and other problems occurring in the prior art. It is an object of the present<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the<br>
following description, particular items are shown, but these are provided for<br>
helping the general understanding of the present invention. Accordingly, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention can be embodied<br>
even without these particular items.<br>
In the following description of the present invention, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be<br>
omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention proposes an apparatus and a method for<br>
transmitting pilot signals, which are reference signals, in a Broadband Wireless<br>
Access (BWA) communication system using a plurality of transmit antennas.<br>
More specifically, the present invention proposes an apparatus and a method for<br>
transmitting pilot signals using a Convolutional Turbo Coding (CTC) scheme in a<br>
BWA communication system using a plurality of transmit antennas.<br>
As one example, the present application describes an Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e communication system for<br>
convenience of description, but a scheme proposed by the present invention can<br>
also be applied to other communication systems. The IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system uses an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme/an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)<br>
scheme in order to support a broadband transmission network for a physical<br>
channel of the wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating a data transmission<br>
operation of a transmitter using a plurality of transmit antennas in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, it is assumed that a transmitter, e.g., a Base Station<br>
(BS) 200, uses a plurality of transmit antennas, e.g., two transmit antennas, i.e.,<br>
a first transmit antenna(ANT#l) 201 and a second transmit antenna(ANT#2) 202.<br>
The first transmit antenna 201 and the second transmit antenna 202<br>
simultaneously transmit data. The data transmitted through the first transmit<br>
antenna 201 and the second transmit antenna 202 may be varied according to a<br>
coding scheme used by the BS 200.<br>
Table 1 below shows transmission data according to transmission timing<br>
when the BS 200 uses a Space Time Block Code (STBC) coding scheme.<br><br>
Referring to table 1, if data Si and S2 are inputted, the data S] is<br>
transmitted through the first transmit antenna 201 and the data S2 is transmitted<br>
through the second transmit antenna 202 at a timing point t. At a timing point<br>
(t+1), the next transmission time, the data -S2* is transmitted through the first<br>
transmit antenna 201 and the data S1* is transmitted through the second transmit<br>
antenna 202.<br>
As described above, the BS 200 transmits different coded symbols for the<br>
same data through the first transmit antenna 201 and the second transmit antenna<br>
202 using the STBC coding scheme at the different timing points, i.e., the timing<br>
point t and the timing point (t+1), such that an MS can estimate radio channel<br>
conditions according to each transmit antenna.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a mini sub-channel structure in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system using a plurality of transmit antennas according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. The mini sub-channel structure of FIG.<br><br>
3 illustrates a mini sub-channel structure when the BS uses the two transmit<br>
antennas as described in FIG. 2. In order to estimate radio channel conditions of<br>
each of the two transmit antennas, specific pilot signals must be transmitted<br>
according to each transmit antenna. However, if pilot tones for identifying the two<br>
transmit antennas are added to the mini sub-channel structure, when a Single<br>
Input Single Output (SISO) scheme as described in FIG. 1 in the prior art is used,<br>
a ratio of the pilot tones with respect to the total tones increases. As indicated<br>
above, it is noted that the tone is used together with the sub-carrier for<br>
convenience of description.<br>
Because data throughput deteriorates as the ratio of the pilot tones with<br>
respect to the total tones increases, the present invention punctures a<br>
predetermined number of data tones and inserts pilot tones into positions of the<br>
punctured data tones, in order to add the pilot tones for identifying the transmit<br>
antennas, while preventing a data rate from deteriorating. Hereinafter, an<br>
operation for puncturing the data tones and inserting the pilot tones into the<br>
positions of the punctured data tones will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a scheme for mapping a tone to a mini sub-channel<br>
transmitted through the first transmit antenna and a scheme for mapping a tone to<br>
a mini sub-channel transmitted through the second transmit antenna are different.<br>
The mini sub-channel transmitted through the first transmit antenna comprises<br>
two pilot tones 301 and 303. Herein, data should not be transmitted through tones<br>
306 and 308 in the mini sub-channel transmitted through the second transmit<br>
antenna 202, which are located in the same positions as those in which the pilot<br>
tones 301 and 303 exist.<br>
The mini sub-channel transmitted through the second transmit antenna<br>
comprises two pilot tones 305 and 307. Herein, data should not be transmitted<br>
through tones 302 and 304 in the mini sub-channel transmitted through the first<br>
transmit antenna 201, which are located in the same positions as those in which<br>
the pilot tones 305 and 307 exist.<br>
When the pilot tones and the data tones are constructed in this way, it is<br>
possible to estimate channel conditions experienced by signals transmitted<br><br>
through each of the transmit antennas. However, if mini sub-channel signals are<br>
transmitted in this way when multiple transmit antennas are used, data<br>
transmission efficiency may deteriorate and it is difficult to reliably transmit<br>
information data because the coded information data, i.e., the coded symbols,<br>
must be punctured, as described in the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention encodes information data using a CTC<br>
encoding scheme, and enables a parity symbol, which is a coded symbol<br>
corresponding to a parity from among the coded symbols, to be located in a tone<br>
corresponding to a pilot tone transmitting pilot signals through a different<br>
transmit antenna instead of a corresponding transmit antenna, such that the parity<br>
symbol is truncated instead of a data symbol. Further, a null tone is inserted into a<br>
position from which the data symbol has been truncated. That is, null data is<br>
transmitted through a tone of the position from which the data symbol has been<br>
truncated.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a CTC encoder in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Herein, it is assumed that the CTC coder has a coding rate of 1/3 (R = 1/3).<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, when information data streams A and B are input, the<br>
CTC encoder outputs the information data streams A and B (401). The<br>
information data streams A and B output from the CTC encoder comprise<br>
systematic symbols.<br>
After receiving the information data streams A and B, the CTC encoder<br>
interleaves the received information data streams A and B through a CTC<br>
interleaver 410 and outputs the interleaved signals to a constituent encoder 420.<br>
The CTC interleaver 410 is connected to a switch 430 that enables the interleaved<br>
signals to be sequentially output through the constituent encoder 420 as two pairs<br>
of parity symbols. When the constituent encoder 420 encodes the information<br>
data streams A and B, the switch 430 performs a switching operation to input the<br>
signals output from the CTC interleaver 410 to the constituent encoder 420.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the two pairs of parity symbols (Y1 W1 and (Y2, W2)<br><br>
sequentially output from the constituent encoder 420. Accordingly, the coding rate<br>
R of 1/3 is actually satisfied.<br>
The constituent encoder 420 comprises five adders, i.e., a first adder<br>
421, a second adder 423, a third adder 425, a fourth adder 427, and a fifth adder<br>
428, and three delayers, i.e., a first delayer 422, a second delayer 424, and a third<br>
delayer 426. Signals Y1 and Y2 are sequentially output from the fourth adder 427,<br>
and signals W1 and W2 are sequentially output from the fifth adder 428, thereby<br>
generating the two pairs of parity symbols (Y1, W1) and (Y2, W2)(402).<br>
The symbols coded through the CTC encoder in this way are interleaved<br>
again, which will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram schematically illustrating an interleaving operation for<br>
the systematic symbol stream and the parity symbol stream output from the CTC<br>
encoder in the IEEE 802.16e communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, an AB sub-block 500 is obtained by<br>
connecting, in serial, two systematic symbol streams, i.e., a systematic symbol<br>
stream A and a systematic symbol stream B. A Y1 sub-block 501 is a parity<br>
symbol stream Y1, a Y2 sub-block 502 is a parity symbol stream Y2, a W1 sub-<br>
block 503 is a parity symbol stream W1, and a W2 sub-block 504 is a parity<br>
symbol stream W2. The Y1 sub-block 501 and the Y2 sub-block 502 represent<br>
symbol streams output from the fourth adder 427 as described in FIG. 4, and the<br>
W1sub-block 503 and the fifth adder 428 as described in FIG. 4. These symbol streams output as<br>
described above are interleaved by the following scheme:<br>
(1)	the symbols comprised in a systematic part are interleaved in the<br>
systematic part;<br>
(2)	the parity symbols are interleaved between the parity symbol streams<br>
output from the same adder; and<br>
(3)	in the interleaving between parity symbols, the parity symbols are<br>
arranged in such a manner that they are alternately taken one-by-one from the two<br>
parity symbol streams.<br>
That is, the AB sub-block 500 is interleaved in a sub-block interleaver<br><br>
510. The Y1 sub-block 501 and the Y2 sub-block 502 are interleaved in a sub-<br>
block interleaver 511 and a sub-block interleaver 512. The W1 sub-block 503 and<br>
the W2 sub-block 504 are interleaved in a sub-block interleaver 513 and a sub-<br>
block interleaver 514.<br>
The symbol streams interleaved by the interleaving scheme as described<br>
above are generated as a systematic symbol stream or parity symbol streams. That<br>
is, the AB sub-block 500 is interleaved so as to be generated as a final systematic<br>
symbol stream 530. The Y1 sub-block 501 and the Y2 sub-block 502 are<br>
interleaved so as to be generated as a parity symbol stream 531. The W1 sub-block<br>
503 and the W2 sub-block 504 are interleaved so as to be generated as another<br>
parity symbol stream 532. Accordingly, the final coding rate is 1/3.<br>
When the symbol streams are transmitted, the symbol streams are<br>
transmitted in an order as illustrated in FIG. 5. That is, the systematic symbol<br>
stream 530 is transmitted for the first time and the parity symbol stream 532 is<br>
transmitted for the last time. The CTC encoder as described above has a<br>
characteristic in which it transmits a symbol stream, which represents the most<br>
important information, i.e., important information having the highest priority, for<br>
the first time. Accordingly, when using the CTC encoder, the CTC encoder has a<br>
better coding performance when the puncture is performed for the last symbols<br>
output from the CTC encoder than when randomly puncturing data. That is,<br>
when the CTC encoder is used, data should not be randomly punctured. It is<br>
necessary to remove data from the last symbols output from the CTC encoder to<br>
improve the coding performance.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
transmitter comprises a CTC encoder 601, a modulator 602, an STBC encoder<br>
603, a first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1, a second pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-<br>
2, a first sub-carrier mapper 605-1, a second sub-carrier mapper 605-2, a first<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit 606-1, a second IFFT unit 606-2, a<br>
first filter 607-1, a second filter 607-2, a first Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)<br>
608-1, a second DAC 608-2, a first Radio Frequency (RF) processor 609-1, a<br>
second RF processor 609-2, a first transmit antenna ANT#1, and a second<br><br>
transmit antenna ANT#2.<br>
If information data streams to be transmitted to the transmitter are input,<br>
the information data streams are transferred to the CTC encoder 601. The CTC<br>
encoder 601 codes the information data streams using a CTC encoding scheme<br>
and outputs the coded symbol streams to the modulator 602. The modulator 602<br>
inputs the coded symbol streams output from the CTC encoder 601, modulates<br>
the input symbol streams using a predetermined modulation scheme, e.g., a<br>
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) scheme, and outputs the modulated<br>
symbol streams to the STBC encoder 603.<br>
The STBC encoder 603 inputs the signals output from the modulator 602<br>
and encodes the input signals using the STBC scheme. The STBC encoder 603<br>
outputs a coded symbol stream, which is to be transmitted through the first<br>
transmit antenna, to the first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1, and outputs a coded<br>
symbol stream, which is to be transmitted through the second transmit antenna, to<br>
the second pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-2.<br>
The first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1 inputs the signals output from the<br>
STBC encoder 603, inserts pilot sub-carriers to be transmitted through the first<br>
transmit antenna, and outputs signals including the pilot sub-carriers to the first<br>
sub-carrier mapper 605-1. The first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1 constructs a<br>
mini sub-channel as described in FIG. 3. Because this operation has been<br>
described in detail with reference FIG. 3 above, a detailed description will be<br>
omitted here.<br>
The first sub-carrier mapper 605-1 maps the signals output from the first<br>
pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1 according to the types of a sub-carrier to be<br>
applied to the transmitter, and outputs the mapped signals to the first IFFT unit<br>
606-1. The first IFFT unit 606-1 performs an IFFT for the signals output from the<br>
first sub-carrier mapper 605-1 in order to generate signals on a time domain, and<br>
outputs the generated signals to the first filter 607-1.<br>
The first filter 607-1 inputs and filters the signals output from the first<br>
IFFT unit 606-1 and outputs the filtered signals to the first DAC 608-1. The first<br><br>
DAC 608-1 converts the signals output from the first filter 607-1 into analog<br>
signals and outputs the analog signals to the first RF processor 609-1. The first<br>
RF processor 609-1, including a front end unit, etc., RF-processes the analog<br>
signals output from the first DAC 608-1, and transmits the processed signals<br>
through the first transmit antenna.<br>
The second pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-2 inputs the signals output from<br>
the STBC encoder 603, inserts pilot sub-carriers to be transmitted through the<br>
second transmit antenna, and outputs signals including the pilot sub-carriers to the<br>
second sub-carrier mapper 605-2. The second pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-2<br>
constructs a mini sub-channel as described in FIG. 3. As indicated above, because<br>
this operation has been described in detail in FIG. 3, a detailed description will be<br>
omitted here.<br>
The second sub-carrier mapper 605-2 maps the signals output from the<br>
second pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-2 according to the types of a sub-carrier to be<br>
applied to the transmitter, and outputs the mapped signals to the second IFFT unit<br>
606-2. The second IFFT unit 606-2 performs an IFFT for the signals output from<br>
the second sub-carrier mapper 605-2 in order to generate signals on a time<br>
domain, and outputs the generated signals to the second filter 607-2.<br>
The second filter 607-2 inputs and filters the signals output from the<br>
second IFFT unit 606-2 and outputs the filtered signals to the second DAC 608-2.<br>
The second DAC 608-2 converts the signals output from the second filter 607-2<br>
into analog signals and outputs the analog signals to the second RF processor<br>
609-2. The second RF processor 609-2, including a front end unit, etc., RF-<br>
processes the analog signals output from the second DAC 608-2, and transmits<br>
the processed signals through the second transmit antenna.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an insertion operation of the pilot<br>
sub-carriers performed by the first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1 and the second<br>
pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-2. However, for convenience of description, the<br>
insertion operation will only be described with reference to the operation of the<br>
first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 7, in step 701, the first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1<br>
inputs the signals output from the STBC encoder 603 and performs a data<br>
truncation according to the structure of a mini sub-channel to be transmitted<br>
through the first transmit antenna. The data truncation is performed for parity<br>
symbols, instead of systematic symbols, by using the characteristics of the CTC<br>
encoding scheme in order to prevent performance deterioration, as described<br>
above. Further, in the data truncation, it is inevitably necessary to consider<br>
insertion of pilot signals and sub-carriers that cannot transmit data due to<br>
transmission of the pilot signals through another transmit antenna, i.e., the second<br>
transmit antenna.<br>
In step 702, the first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1 inserts pilot signals to<br>
be transmitted through the first transmit antenna into a corresponding pilot sub-<br>
carrier. The insertion of the pilot signals is performed for a sub-carrier without<br>
data as described above. In step 703, the first pilot sub-carrier inserter 604-1<br>
rearranges symbols, including the pilot signals, from which data is truncated, and<br>
outputs the symbols to the first sub-carrier mapper 605-1. Thereafter, the<br>
procedure ends.<br>
Herein, the symbols are rearranged to represent the mini sub-channel<br>
structure.<br>
According to the present invention, as described above, when an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system uses a plurality of transmit antennas, pilot signals<br>
for identifying the transmit antennas are transmitted, such that the estimation<br>
performance for radio channel conditions can be maximized. Further, a data<br>
truncation scheme is used when the pilot signals for identifying the transmit<br>
antennas are transmitted, so that estimation for radio channel conditions can be<br>
performed, which can minimize system capacity reduction, while maintaining a<br>
data rate.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
