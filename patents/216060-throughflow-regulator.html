INSERTABLE COMPONENT WHICH CAN BE INSERTED INTO A<br>
GAS OR LIQUID LINE<br>
The invention relates to an insertable component, which is embodied as a<br>
non-return element and which can be inserted into a gas or liquid line,<br>
having a housing" with at least one closing body being displaceably arranged<br>
inside the housing, that seals a through-flow opening or several through-flow<br>
openings of feeder channels in the closed position.<br>
The invention also relates to an insertable component, which is embodied as<br>
a through-flow regulator and which can be inserted into a gas or liquid line,<br>
having a housing with at least one throttle body or regulating body being<br>
arranged inside said housing, limiting a regulating gap between itself and a<br>
housing wall, with the gap changing depending on pressure.<br>
It is commonly known to combine several sanitary components into a single<br>
sanitary insertable unit, particularly some that serve various functions.<br>
From DE 297 03 335 Ul by the applicant, a backflow preventer has been<br>
known, which represents a component of an insertable sanitary unit in<br>
addition to comprising an upstream sieve for contaminants and a<br>
downstream through-flow regulator. Such sanitary insertable units are<br>
inserted for example at the cold water and warm water inlet in thermostat-<br>
controlled mixing faucets, in order to prevent, with the help of the non-return<br>
unit, the entry of cold water into the warm water pipe and vice versa and in<br>
order to ensure an even water flow, using the through-flow regulator, even in<br>
varying liquid pressures of the inflowing water.<br>
1<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
The previously known backflow preventer comprises a housing with a cone-<br>
shaped valve arranged therein. The cone-shaped valve cooperates with the<br>
valve seat, which is molded inside the housing. The cone-shaped valve can be<br>
displaced from a closed position into an open position by the pressure of the<br>
inflowing water against the returning force of a pressure spring. In an<br>
opposite flow, the cone-shaped valve is displaced inside the housing towards<br>
the valve seat and the return preventor is closed to prevent any undesired<br>
return flow.<br>
The through-flow regulator provided in the sanitary insertable unit according<br>
to DE 297 03 335 Ul and positioned downstream the above-described<br>
through-flow regulator comprises a control core, conically tapering in the<br>
through-flow direction, which cooperates with a rubber ring that can be<br>
widened depending on water pressure.<br>
The previously known sanitary insertable unit and, in particular, the<br>
insertable components contained therein are multipart and correspondingly<br>
expensive in their production. Due to the fact that the insertable components<br>
serving various functions are positioned downstream of one another in the<br>
through-flow direction, the insertable sanitary unit of prior art comprises a<br>
comparatively large construction length, which can be further extended by<br>
additional insertable components added upstream or downstream.<br>
Therefore, the object is particularly to provide insertable components of the<br>
type mentioned at the outset that can be inserted into gas or liquid lines,<br>
which can be produced with comparatively little expense and which are<br>
designed simple and compact.<br>
2<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
In the insertable component according to the invention, embodied as a<br>
backflow preventer, the solution comprises for the housing to be made from at<br>
least two housing parts and being provided with feeder channels in at least<br>
one annular area, which open into a housing chamber, and that a housing<br>
seal is provided between facing sides of two adjacent housing parts, the<br>
housing seal is connected in one piece to an annular membrane, which can be<br>
displaced by the flow medium, inside the housing chamber, and forms a<br>
closing body.<br>
The insertable component according to the invention, embodied as a non-<br>
return element, is provided with a housing which is formed by at least two<br>
preferably coaxial housing parts. A housing part seal is held between these<br>
housing parts, connected in one piece to at least one annular membrane,<br>
which can be displaced by the flow medium, inside a housing chamber. When<br>
return flow occurs, at least one annular membrane forming a closing body<br>
seals the through-flow opening of the feeder channels, which are arranged in<br>
at least one annular area inside the housing of the outer housing. However,<br>
with a liquid flow, flowing in the normal through-flow direction, the at least<br>
one annular membrane is displaced from the closing position into the open<br>
position, in which the through-flow openings remain open. The non-return<br>
element according to the invention can thus be combined from as little as<br>
three parts, namely the two housing parts and the single part combining the<br>
annular membrane and the housing seal. The non-return element according<br>
to the invention can therefore be produced easily and in a compact size.<br>
A particularly simple embodiment of the insertable component embodied as a<br>
non-return element provides for the housing seal and the at least one annular<br>
membrane, forming the closing body,<br>
3<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
to be embodied as a flat body. In the insertable component according to the<br>
invention the housing seal and the at least one annular membrane, forming<br>
the closing body, can be embodied as a one-piece flat body and do not require<br>
any complicated design.<br>
The solution provides for the insertable component embodied as a through-<br>
flow regulator according to the invention, that the housing is made from at<br>
least two housing parts and that between the facing sides of two adjacent<br>
housing parts, a housing seal is provided, which is connected in one piece to<br>
the at least one throttle body located inside the housing.<br>
The insertable component, embodied as a through-flow regulator, comprises a<br>
housing, which is composed of at least two preferably coaxial housing parts.<br>
A housing seal is held between these housing parts, connected in one piece to<br>
the at least one throttle body located inside the housing. This at least one<br>
throttle body limits a control gap between itself and a housing wall, which<br>
gap changes depending on pressure. In this way, the insertable component<br>
embodied as a through-flow regulator can be composed inexpensively from<br>
only three individual components.<br>
In order to securely fasten the housing seal and the annular membrane<br>
connected thereto and/or the throttle body to the inside of the housing in a<br>
simple manner, it is advantageous for the housing parts to be provided with<br>
annular flat surfaces, facing one another, between which the housing seal can<br>
be mounted.<br>
4<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
In order to further facilitate the production of the insertable components<br>
according to the invention it is advantageous for the at least two housing<br>
parts to be provided with snap elements for connecting the housing parts,<br>
engaging one another in the mounted position. This way, a complicated<br>
screw connection, gluing, or welding can be omitted for the assembly of the<br>
exterior housing formed by the housing parts.<br>
A particularly easy to assembly embodiment according to the invention<br>
provides for the snap elements of one of the housing parts to comprise a<br>
central opening and for the other housing part to preferably comprise several<br>
engaging hook elements.<br>
The insertable component according to the invention can be easily<br>
disassembled, if necessary, when the hook elements of the one housing<br>
component penetrate the other housing component in the assembled position<br>
and extend beyond its exterior.<br>
A preferred embodiment according to the invention provides for the facial<br>
areas clamping the housing seal to be located at the exterior rim of the<br>
housing parts. The rim position of the clamping area of the housing seal<br>
allows for a comparatively large functional area inside the housing for<br>
annular membranes and/or throttle bodies.<br>
The small number of parts of the insertable component according to the<br>
invention is enhanced even more when the internal surface of the housing<br>
part arranged in the flow direction extends beyond the clamping area of the<br>
housing seal towards the inside and forms a section of the housing chamber<br>
wall, and where one or several feeder channels open, The through openings<br>
of these feeder channels can be arranged in several, particularly concentric<br>
annular areas of the housing. However, it is particularly advantageous for<br>
5<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
several feeder channels to be arranged on an annular part of the housing,<br>
distributed in the circumferential direction, which preferably open<br>
immediately adjacent to the clamping area of the region of the annular<br>
membrane that forms the housing seal.<br>
The insertable component embodied as a non-return element reacts<br>
particularly quickly to small return flows when the annular membrane is<br>
extended inwardly beyond a region internally adjacent to the housing seal,<br>
forming the closing body, and thus forms a separating wall in the open or<br>
through-flow position, dividing the housing chamber into two partial annular<br>
chambers, and in this position contacts with its free interior annular rim the<br>
housing part at the downstream side, when a penetrating and/or through-<br>
flow opening follows to the upstream partial annular chamber and when at<br>
least one non-return opening opens into the downstream partial chamber.<br>
In order to fasten the throttle body in its control position it is advantageous<br>
for the throttle body to be fastened in a housing chamber between the<br>
upstream and the downstream housing part and for the downstream housing<br>
part to comprise a downstream rest and an exterior support and for the<br>
upstream housing part to comprise an interior housing wall or a similar rest,<br>
forming the limit of the control gap, for the annular throttle body.<br>
A particularly advantageous further development according to the invention,<br>
which independent protection is claimed, provides for the insertable<br>
component according to the invention to be embodied as a non-return element<br>
and as a through-flow regulator.<br>
6<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
Here it can be advantageous for the annular membrane to be embodied as a<br>
closing body adjacent to the housing seal and to be connected to the throttle<br>
body in one piece at its interior end. This further developed embodiment,<br>
which can also be made from as little as three individual parts, is embodied<br>
both as a non-return element as well as a through-flow regulator. Here, the<br>
closing body required for the non-return element and the throttle body<br>
required for the through-flow regulator are connected in one piece to the<br>
housing seal. Such an embodiment is particularly compact and is<br>
characterized in a low construction height, as well.<br>
The small number of parts of the insertable component according to the<br>
invention is even further enhanced in its high functionality when it is<br>
embodied for the insertion into a liquid line and comprises an annular seal at<br>
an exterior thereof for sealing the liquid line, and when the annular seal is<br>
connected in one piece to the housing seal between the facing sides of the<br>
housing component.<br>
Here, it is particularly advantageous for the exterior annular seal to be<br>
embodied as an O-ring seal or an annular cord seal.<br>
In order to fasten the annular seal to the exterior of the housing it is<br>
advantageous for an annular groove to be provided on the outside between<br>
the two adjacent housing parts for accepting the exterior annular seal and for<br>
the annular groove to be formed by a housing recess in one housing part,<br>
open towards the separation point of the housing for forming a side wall and<br>
the bottom of the groove, and for the interior facing surface of the other<br>
housing part to form the second side wall.<br>
7<br><br>
WO2004/083699	■	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
Another preferred embodiment, worth protecting in itself, relates to an<br>
insertable component embodied as a through-flow regulator, which can<br>
maintain the constant through-flow of fluid under a wide range of pressures,<br>
from 0.1 bar to 10 bar, for example.<br>
Previous embodiments of sanitary through-flow regulators have their<br>
respective strengths in certain pressure zones. For example, through-flow<br>
regulators have been known which achieve a characteristic through-flow at<br>
very high pressures, however they have problems to stabilize the target line<br>
in the medium and strong pressure ranges. The separating line drifts<br>
upward or downward or it shows oscillating phenomenon.  Other known<br>
embodiments of throughflow-regulators, operating very well in medium to<br>
high pressure ranges, use an O-ring which counteracts a control profile.<br>
However, at very low differential pressures of 0.1 bar, for example, the O-ring<br>
does not react to the pressure difference, the through-flow results entirely<br>
from the available cross-section. Due to the fact that the O-ring only reacts<br>
at a relatively high pressure, the free cross-section cannot be selected too<br>
large because otherwise the through-flow becomes too large in the reaction<br>
range and an undesired exceeding of the characteristic line occurs.<br>
Therefore, through-flow regulators of this type only achieve their respective<br>
targeted through-flow at approx. 0.7 to 1.0 bar. A similar embodiment of this<br>
class of through-flow regulators is the elastomer disc, which is supported<br>
with its flat bottom on a support profile.<br>
A further development according to the invention provides for the housing<br>
seal at both sides to be connected in one piece to at least one throttle body<br>
each, which throttle body being supported on the inside of the housing in a<br>
control gap. Here, it is particularly advantageous for the throttle body<br>
8<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
provided at both sides of the housing seal to react at different differential<br>
pressures, and for a first throttle body preferably to react in a low-pressure<br>
range and, in contrast thereto, a second throttle body in a high-pressure<br>
range.<br>
The housing seal in this embodiment according to the invention is therefore<br>
connected in one piece at both sides to a throttle body each. The throttle<br>
bodies react with different sensitivities and thus they can control the<br>
through-flow amount in various pressure ranges such that they complement<br>
each other, particularly in the low-pressure and the high-pressure range.<br>
While the highly sensitive throttle body already diminishes the free cross-<br>
section of the flow of the control gap at a low differential pressure of 0.1 bar,<br>
for example, the throttle body reacting to high differential pressure deforms<br>
not until a further increased pressure and thus keeps the through-flow<br>
constant in the high pressure range. The characteristic line of such a<br>
regulator achieves-the targeted through-flow at very low pressures and<br>
maintains it at a constant levels up to a high pressure range of approximately<br>
10 bar, for example.<br>
It can be useful for the insertable component embodied as a non-return<br>
element and/or a through-flow regulator to be provided with at least one<br>
throttle body or regulating body designed in a lip-shaped manner. However,<br>
it is also possible for the insertable component to additionally or instead<br>
comprise a throttle body designed as at least one O-ring.<br>
In order for the lip-shaped throttle body to be able to react sensitively to a<br>
differential pressure it is useful for at least one lip-shaped throttle body with<br>
9<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
its free lip end region to be aligned preferably diagonally opposite the<br>
through-flow direction.<br>
In order to abruptly increase the resistance of the throttle body, beginning at<br>
a predetermined rate of deformation, one embodiment according to the<br>
invention provides for the control movement of at least one lip-shaped<br>
throttle body to be limited by a control stop.<br>
By arranging this control stop and by providing an appropriate distance of<br>
the control stop and the throttle body arranged upstream therefrom the<br>
differential pressure can be varied by the design, at which the respective<br>
throttle body is to react. Additionally or instead thereof it can also be<br>
provided for the throttle bodies, arranged at both sides of the housing seal, to<br>
be designed differently, each adjusted to their reactive pressure.<br>
For example it is possible, on the one hand, that the housing seal is connected<br>
to a lip-shaped throttle body and, on the other hand, to a throttle body<br>
embodied as an O-ring. While the comparatively soft, lip-shaped throttle<br>
body already reacts to low differential pressures, an appropriately stiff<br>
throttle body, embodied as an o-ring, can be characterized by a high reaction<br>
pressure, in reference thereto. However, it is also possible for the housing<br>
seal to be connected at both sides with lip-shaped or with O-ring shaped<br>
throttle bodies, which become active at different pressure ranges based on<br>
their design and dimensions.<br>
Therefore, another embodiment according to the invention provides for the<br>
housing seal to be connected at both sides each with a lip-shaped throttle<br>
body.<br>
10<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
The reaction behavior of the through-flow regulator according to the<br>
invention can also be influenced such that the throttle body reacting in the<br>
low-pressure range is allocated to the interior or exterior control gap, because<br>
the throttle body effective in the exterior control gap seals a larger area<br>
during its deformation radially outward than the lip of the throttle body<br>
located inside the control gap.<br>
A further development of the invention provides for the housing seal and the<br>
throttle bodies connected thereto to be formed as a multi-component die-cast<br>
part and for the throttle bodies to be comprised of various elastomers.<br>
In order to enhance an easy reaction of the throttle body of the insertable<br>
component embodied as a through-flow regulator and in order to be able to<br>
predetermine said through-flow regulator to a fixed maximum amount of flow<br>
it is advantageous for the housing wall limiting the control gap to be provided<br>
with rib-shaped, grooved, or similarly embodied regulating profiling aligned<br>
approximately in the through-flow direction.<br>
Additionally embodiments of the invention are described in the sub claims.<br>
In the following, the invention and its essential details are explained further<br>

A sanitary insertable component, which can be inserted into a gas or liquid<br>
line, is shown in Figures 1 and 2 in different embodiments 1, 10. While the<br>
insertable component 10 in Figure 2 is to serve merely as a non-return<br>
element, the insertable component 1 in Figure 1 is integrated both as a non-<br>
return element as well as a through-flow regulator.<br>
The exterior housing 2 of the insertable components 1, 10 is formed from two<br>
coaxial housing parts 3, 4, having sides that face one another between which<br>
a housing seal 5 is held. The housing parts 3, 4 are connected to one another<br>
via snap elements which engage in the mounted position. For this purpose,<br>
the downstream housing part 4 is provided with a central opening 6, with 4<br>
hook elements 7, pointing cross-wise away from one another, and engaging<br>
the upstream housing part 3, These hook elements 7 extend beyond the<br>
downstream exterior face of the housing 2.<br>
The insertable component 1, 10, can be inserted into a liquid line. In order to<br>
seal the interior circumference of the liquid line, an annular seal 8 is<br>
provided, which is connected in one piece to the housing seal 5. This annular<br>
seal 8, embodied as an annular cord seal, is held in an annular groove 9,<br>
which is provided on the outside between the two housing parts 3, 4 for<br>
accepting the annular seal 8.<br>
The annular groove 9 is limited by a housing recess, open towards the<br>
separating point of the exterior housing 2, at the upstream housing part 3,<br>
which housing recess forms a side wall and the groove base. However, the<br>
13<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
interior surface of the other housing part 4 forms the other side wall of the<br>
annular groove 9.<br>
The two housing parts 3, 4 are provided at their exterior edges with annular<br>
surfaces, facing one another, between which the housing seal 5 is clamped.<br>
The housing seal 5, at the side facing away from the annular seal 8, is<br>
connected in one piece to an annular membrane 11, which can be displaced<br>
inside a housing chamber 12 by the flow medium and which is embodied as a<br>
closing body of the non-return element.<br>
Starting at the upstream surface of the exterior housing 2, several feeder<br>
channels 13 lead through the housing part 3, lead with their through<br>
openings 14 into the housing chamber 12 at a distance from one another in<br>
the circumferential direction. While the annular membrane 11 is displaced<br>
by a flow of liquid flowing in the usual through-flow direction Pfl in its open<br>
position, it is held in its closing position during a back flow, opposite the<br>
through-flow direction Pfl, which seals the downstream mouths of the<br>
through openings 14 with the annular membrane 11.<br>
The annular membrane 11 of the insertable component 1 shown in Figure 1<br>
is connected in one piece to a throttle body or control body 15 of the through-<br>
flow regulator with its interior end, facing away from the seals 5, 8, The<br>
throttle body 15; also located in the housing chamber 12 inside the housing of<br>
the exterior housing 2, limits a control gap 17 between itself and the housing<br>
wall 16, with the gap changing depending on pressure,. The throttle body 15<br>
is embodied in the shape of an O-ring and mounted between the upstream<br>
and the downstream housing part 3, 4 inside the housing chamber 12.<br>
14<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
While the downstream housing part 4 forms a downstream rest and an<br>
exterior support for the throttle body 15, the upstream housing part 3 is<br>
provided with a central housing or control core, tapering in the through-flow<br>
direction Pfl, which forms the housing wall 16 serving as a control gap limit<br>
for the annular throttle body 15 and having hook elements 7 protruding from<br>
the face of its free end..<br>
In the insertable component 10 according to Figure 2, the housing seal 5,<br>
connected to the annular seal 8, and the annular membrane 11, adjacent<br>
towards the inside and serving as a closing body of the non-return element,<br>
are provided as flat bodies. Here, the annular membrane 11 is extended<br>
inwardly beyond an area adjacent to the housing seal 5, provided as a closing<br>
body, and forms in the open position a separating wall, dividing the housing<br>
chamber 12 into two partial annular chambers 19, 20, with not only the<br>
through openings 14 of the feeder channels 13 leading into the upstream<br>
partial annular chamber 19 but also the downstream openings 21, which<br>
remain in the central opening 6 between the hook elements 7. However,<br>
several return flow openings 22 open into the downstream partial annular<br>
space 20, which guide the return flow into the partial annular space 20<br>
affecting the downstream surface of the exterior housing 2, with the return<br>
flow in the closed position pressing the annular membrane 11 against the<br>
through openings 14 and/or the rounded or curved interior annular rim 23<br>
against the central housing core 18.<br>
The reaction pressure and the reaction behavior of the closing and/or the<br>
throttle body can be determined depending on the rubber-elastic<br>
characteristics of the material used, for example, the shore-hardness.<br>
15<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
Furthermore, the reaction pressure and the reaction speed, particularly of<br>
the function of the non-return element, can be modified by the selection of the<br>
radial pre-tension of the annular membrane 11.<br>
Various embodiments 100, 101, 102, and 103 of an insertable component<br>
provided as a through-flow regulator are shown in Figures 4 through 8. The<br>
housing 2 of insertable components 100, 101, 102, and 103, insertable in a gas<br>
or liquid line, is also provided with two housing parts 3, 4, which clamp a<br>
housing seal 5 between one another. The housing seal 5 is connected in one<br>
piece on both sides with one throttle body 15, 15' each. Each of these throttle<br>
bodies 15, 15' is supported in a control gap 17, 17', respectively, on the inside<br>
of the housing 2.<br>
As is discernible from the longitudinal cross-sections in Figures 4, 6, 7, and 8,<br>
the housing parts 3, 4 are each provided with at least two concentric annular<br>
housing walls 24, 25, and 26 and/or 24', 25', and 26', which are connected to<br>
one another via radial connection bars 27 in the form of spokes. The annular<br>
walls 24/24', 25/25', and 26/26' are allocated in pairs towards one another,<br>
with the two central facial walls 25/25' of said housing parts 3, 4 clamping<br>
the housing seal 5 between their facial surfaces facing one another and<br>
separating the parallel control gaps 17, 17' from one another.<br>
At the sides of the adjacent annular walls 24/25' and/or 26/26', facing the<br>
central annular walls 25/25', a control profiling 28, 28' is provided each<br>
aligned in a through-flow direction, which is formed here by grooves or bars<br>
distributed in the circumferential direction. Here, the throttle bodies 15, 15'<br>
can be provided at the housing parts 3, 4 with control profiling 28, 28*<br>
embodied differently.<br>
16<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
The throttle bodies 15, 15' provided on both sides of the housing seal 5 react<br>
at different differential pressures. While a first throttle body 15 preferably<br>
reacts in the low pressure range, a second throttle body 15' reacts in the high<br>
pressure range, in contrast thereto, In order to ensure a different reaction of<br>
the throttle bodies 15, 15', the throttle bodies 15, 15' are provided with<br>
different shapes adjusted to their pressure, for example, as shown in the<br>
insertable components 100, 101, 102, and 103.<br>
For example, at the housing seal 5 of the insertable components 100, 102<br>
shown in the Figures 4 and 7, one geometrically soft and one oppositely stiff<br>
lip are provided as throttle bodies 15, 15', reacting with different sensibility<br>
to the differential pressure. The throttle bodies 15, 15' having different<br>
stiffnesses control the through-flow amounts in the various pressure ranges<br>
and complement one another this way in the low pressure and the high<br>
pressure range.<br>
For very low differential pressure, for example amounting to 0.1 bar, the<br>
geometrically soft lip embodiment, serving as a throttle body 15, contacts the<br>
control profiling and begins to reduce the free flow cross-section. The<br>
geometrically stiff lip 15' does not deform, which allows the free cross-section<br>
of this area to be fully available for the flow of the fluid. By the large<br>
geometrical elasticity of the lip embodiment 15, the shape is deformed very<br>
rapidly into the control profiling by any rising pressure, i.e. in the range up to<br>
0,4 bar, and ultimately seals the free cross-sections available here. When the<br>
pressure further increases, the stiff lip formation, serving as a throttle body<br>
15', deforms as well and thus maintains a constant through-flow in the high<br>
pressure range.<br>
17<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
The two variants of these two-step types of through-flow regulators differ<br>
from each other in which throttle body 15, 15' is active towards the inside and<br>
which one is active towards the outside.<br>
In the through-flow regulator 100 shown in Figures 4 and 5, the<br>
geometrically stiff and the geometrically soft lip embodiment 15, 15' are<br>
connected to one another by the circumferential housing seal 5. The housing<br>
seal 5 is fixed in its position by the annular housing walls 25/25' of the upper<br>
housing part 3 and the lower housing part 4. The annular housing walls 25,<br>
25' and the housing seal 5 are adjusted to one another such that the control<br>
gaps 17, 17', allocated to the throttle bodies 15, 15', are separated from one<br>
another in a water-tight manner. For this purpose, one of the annular walls<br>
25, 25' can be provided with a circumferentially raised sealing bar, which is<br>
pressed into the housing seal 5. The embodiment of the housing parts 3, 4 in<br>
the area of the downstream connection bars 27 determines if any distance<br>
remains between the throttle bodies 15, 15' and the downstream connection<br>
bars 27 and to what extent, which also serve as control stops.<br>
The connection bars 27 serving as control stops and their distance from the<br>
throttle bodies 15, 15' influence the control behavior of the insertable<br>
components shown here; in the flow of the fluid the lip-shaped throttle bodies<br>
15, 15' deform relatively easy at the beginning, until the bottom of the lip<br>
contacts the connection bars 27 of the housing 2. When this state has been<br>
reached, the lip-shaped throttle bodies 15, 15' deform to a lesser extent under<br>
increasing differential pressure so that the free cross-sections are not closed<br>
as fast under high pressure. The interior control profiling 28' is provided at<br>
the housing wall formed by the annular walls 26/26'. In contrast thereto, the<br>
housing wall formed by the annular walls<br>
19<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
24/24' is provided on its interior wall with the exterior control profiling 28,<br>
which forms the respective control profile for the geometrically soft lip<br>
embodiment 15 shown in Figure 4,<br>
At the interior annular wall 26, 26' of the central housing embodiment, the<br>
first housing part 3 engages a central recess 31 of the second downstream<br>
housing part 4.<br>
In reference to the through-flow regulator 100 shown in Figures 4 and 5, the<br>
insertable component 102 differs in Figure 7 merely by the arrangement of<br>
its geometrically stiff lip embodiment and its soft one. In the insertable<br>
component 101 shown in Figure 7 the geometrically stiff, lip-shaped throttle<br>
body 15' is provided on the outside, while the geometrically soft lip-shaped<br>
throttle body 15 is arranged on the inside. The lip-shaped throttle body 15',<br>
supported in the exterior control gap 17, seals a larger surface during<br>
deformation radially outward than the lip-shaped throttle body 15 affecting<br>
the interior radius. This way, the arrangement of the lip-shaped throttle<br>
body 15, 15' on the inside or the outside affects the reaction behavior of these<br>
insertable components.<br>
While in Figure 6 the lip-shaped, softer throttle body 15 affects the exterior<br>
control gap 17 and the O-ring shaped, stifTer throttle body 15' is located<br>
inside the control gap 17T, the O-ring shaped throttle body 15' is arranged in<br>
the exterior control gap 17 in the insertable component 103 shown in Figure<br>
8 and the lip-shaped, softer throttle body 15 is arranged in the interior<br>
control gap 17', in contrast thereto,<br>
The embodiment of the through-flow regulator 100, 101, 102, and 103 shown<br>
here and the reaction behavior of these insertable components can be varied<br>
and influenced constructively by the geometrical stiffness of the soft and the<br>
20<br><br>
WO2004/083699	PCT/EP2004/002507<br>
stiff lip embodiment 15, 15', by the elastic characteristics of the material<br>
used, by the distance of the throttle bodies 15, 15' on the one hand and the<br>
downstream provided control stops, on the other hand, by the dimensions of<br>
the control gap 17, 17' remaining between the throttle body and the adjacent<br>
housing wall, by the control profiling 28, 28' provided at the adjacent housing<br>
wall, and by the arrangement of the sensitively reacting throttle body in the<br>
area of the interior and the exterior control gap 17, 17'.<br>
The insertable components 1, 10, 100, 101, 102, and 103, as discernible from<br>
Figures 1 through 8, can be composed from as little as three parts and are<br>
characterized by their simple production, their compact design, as well as<br>
their low construction height.<br>
