				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention lies in the field of automotive engineering and concerns<br>
according to its type a motor vehicle driven by a combustion engine and<br>
comprising an exhaust system bracket for fastening the exhaust system.<br>
Up to now, exhaust systems in motor vehicles are predominantly fastened to the<br>
vehicular floor pan by means of rubber suspensions. A disadvantage with this<br>
type of fastening is that the rubber suspension in general will not offer a<br>
sufficient damping, so that it may happen that vibrations emanating from the<br>
unit of motor and gearbox, as well as natural oscillations of the exhaust system<br>
are conducted to the vehicular floor pan. Through this, vibrations and humming<br>
noises may occur in the vehicle interior space which are regarded by the driver<br>
and passengers as a great nuisance.<br>
In order to avoid these impairments, it was considered to additionally affix the<br>
exhaust system to the motor housing and gearbox housing, respectively, The<br>
purpose of this arrangement is to reduce the violations of the exhaust system by<br>
damping, using such a bracket which is fixed to the motor or gearbox.<br>
The present invention is based on the object to provide an exhaust system<br>
bracket which allows an efficient damping, further is practicable at low costs and<br>
has a tow weight.<br>
This object is met by the features of the invention.<br>
According to the invention, a bracket for the exhaust system which fulfills the<br>
above requirements is characterized in that the exhaust system is fastened to the<br>
motor and/or the gearbox through the exhaust system bracket which comprises<br>
a<br><br>
supporting element in the form of a plate holder with at least two band-like, elastic<br>
plates which are superimposed so as to form a stack and are able to move relative<br>
to each other on at least a part of their length. A "plate" in the sense of the present<br>
invention is meant to be a flat shape with a length which is considerably larger<br>
than its width, while its thickness is considerably smaller than its width.<br>
If there occurs a vibration-induced deflection in the stacking direction of the<br>
plates, there will be achieved - by the superimposed plates - a damping of the<br>
vibration on account of the friction between the surfaces of the plates which are<br>
moved relative to each other upon such deflection. In this way the vibrations of<br>
the exhaust system will be reduced. Owing to its construction, a supporting<br>
element of this type can be hard enough, on the one hand, to achieve a sufficient<br>
damping of vibrations, and on the other hand can have sufficient pliancy in order<br>
to fulfill the thermomechanical requirements in terms of strength<br>
Compared to a bracket in solid construction and with the same overall height,<br>
it is only a bracket with the plate construction according to the invention which is<br>
able to take up the thermal elongations of the exhaust system relative to the<br>
connected structure. A solid bracket has a higher rigidity in relation to a plate<br>
holder according to the invention and hinders the thermal elongation of the<br>
exhaust system. That's why high stresses arise on the solid bracket, which in the<br>
end may result in a rupture of the bracket due to the constant thermal shock stress.<br>
By increasing the number of the plates in the supporting element it is possible<br>
to advantageously increase the number of the surfaces which rub against each<br>
other during any deflection. Increasing the number of adjoining surfaces rubbing<br>
against each other during displacing will result in an enhancement of the damping<br>
effect, while diminishing such number will result in a reduction in the damping<br>
effect. Same applies to an enlargement of the mutually contacting surfaces of the<br>
plates. According to the invention, at least two plates are stacked in the supporting<br>
element. It is preferred that three to five plates are provided.<br><br>
The damping behavior of the supporting element can be advantageously<br>
influenced by the surface condition of the plates rubbing against each other during<br>
deflection. A smooth surface of the friction surfaces results in a correspondingly<br>
low vibration damping effect because of the comparably low friction, while a<br>
rough surface will enhance the vibration damping effect. Further it may be<br>
favorable to provide a structure on the friction surfaces, for instance linear raised<br>
portions which enhance friction. With a given geometry of the plates in a<br>
supporting element, the frictional effect of mutually abutting plate surfaces can<br>
thus be modified in the desired way.<br>
By altering the geometry of the plates in the supporting element the rigidity<br>
thereof can be modified in an advantageous way. Enlarging the plate thickness<br>
results in an enhanced rigidity with an otherwise unchanged geometry of the<br>
plates, and vice versa. It is likewise possible to induce an enhancement of the<br>
rigidity by reducing the length of the plates with an otherwise unchanged<br>
geometry of the plates, and vice versa. Same applies to the overall thickness<br>
(height) of the supporting element formed by the plates, and to the length of the<br>
supporting element.<br>
One can also have influence on the rigidity and the damping behavior of the<br>
supporting element by the design of the profile of the individual plate. This can be<br>
effected, for instance, by means of U-profiles or T-profiles or stiffening<br>
corrugations. The profile can be provided continuously or in sections.<br>
An alteration of the length of the supporting element further has influence on<br>
its endurance life with regard to the thermal stresses from the exhaust system<br>
Concerning the thermal elongations, these will show varying effects when the<br>
height of the supporting element is altered. In this respect, the height and length of<br>
the supporting element are to be suitably selected in the light of these aspects.<br>
It is possible by virtue of the supporting element, according to the invention,<br>
for fastening the exhaust system to the motor and/or gearbox that the damping<br>
behavior can be influenced at advantage in various directions in a suitable way.<br><br><br>
Such a reliance of the damping effect on the direction can be achieved with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention additionally by means of a suitable<br>
structural shape of the supporting element. For this purpose, the supporting<br>
element thus may have an angular structure as seen in the longitudinal section.<br>
Here it is particularly preferred that the angular structure is a twofold angular<br>
structure in the form of an offset step. "Offset step" in the sense of the present<br>
invention means a structure in which, as seen in the longitudinal section, one end<br>
of the structure is not situated in the prolongation of a tangent to the other end of<br>
the structure.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment for influencing the reliance of the damping<br>
effect on the direction, the supporting element, as seen in the longitudinal section,<br>
has a fourfold angular structure in the form of two offset steps which are arranged<br>
mirror-inverted to each other. A structure of this type is, in particular, designated<br>
for not providing an offset, i.e. as seen in the longitudinal direction one end of the<br>
structure lies in the prolongation of the tangent to the other end of the structure.<br>
The supporting element may also have a helical structure. Hereby the rigidity<br>
against a twisting of the supporting element (rotational force) can be considerably<br>
enhanced.<br>
With the supporting element according to the invention, the plates may consist<br>
of an austenitic or ferritic material. Non-ferrous, metallic materials (e.g. carbon<br>
fibers, plastics, aluminum etc.) which meet the demands on the mechanical and<br>
thermomechanical durability, may also be employed. It is likewise possible that<br>
the plates are made of spring steel. Given the geometry of the plates or of the<br>
supporting element, the selection of a suitable material depends in particular on<br>
the rigidity, the damping effect and the thermal resistance. For this purpose, the<br>
plates in particular may be made of the same material or of different materials.<br>
The plates can also have differing thicknesses.<br>
A mutual fastening of the plates in such a manner that they can be moved<br>
relative to each other at least on a part of their length, is preferably established by<br><br><br>
screwing, welding or a form-fitting and/or force-fitting connection. In the latter<br>
case there is preferred a particularly simple embodiment in which one exterior<br>
plate in the plate stack is flanged so as to clamp the plates of the supporting<br>
element on at least one front end and/or longitudinal side. Thereby it is possible to<br>
achieve an asymmetric characteristic in terms of rigidity.<br>
The supporting element according to the invention can be directly fastened to<br>
the exhaust system and/or to the motor- or gearbox housing by means of welding,<br>
for example. It would also be possible that the supporting element according to<br>
the invention is fastened to the exhaust system by means of a console. The<br>
supporting element according to the invention can be fastened to the motor or<br>
gearbox by a bracket which is provided on the motor- or gearbox side. In the latter<br>
case, fastening the supporting element to the console or above bracket, provided<br>
on the motor- or gearbox side, can be done by screwing.<br>
In summary it can be ascertained that the supporting element according to the<br>
invention allows the damping characteristics to be engineered in an advantageous<br>
manner such that they are different in different directions in space. There may<br>
occur a damping across the range of frequencies to be damped, with the<br>
possibility to have influence on the damping factor in particular by the number of<br>
plates, the thereby involved friction surface of the plate surfaces which rub against<br>
each other when the supporting element is deflected, and the condition of these<br>
surfaces. The rigidity can be influenced in particular by the material selection, the<br>
number of plates and their geometry. In this respect, an adaptation of the specific<br>
design to the needs of the user in terms of damping and rigidity would also be<br>
possible. The thermomechanical endurance life of the supporting element is<br>
ensured by the pliant plate structure.<br>
Compared with conventional suspensions systems for exhaust systems, the<br>
system of the invention for fastening the exhaust system is reasonably priced, as<br>
there is no need for elastomer elements which are susceptible to aging and have to<br>
be shielded, if necessary, nor is it required to provide additional damping systems<br>
like vibration neutralizes or decoupling elements.<br><br><br>
Moreover, the arrangement is compact, so that a small installation space will<br>
be sufficient for fastening the exhaust system to the motor and gearbox,<br>
respectively. The exhaust system bracket can simply be exchanged when a repair<br>
is required. A connection to existing systems is easily possible. It is of advantage<br>
that the gas-carrying system will not be impaired, which otherwise - e.g. in case<br>
decoupling elements are employed - could cause problems with respect to leak<br>
tightness, thermal insulation and endurance life.<br>
This is why additional supporting elements for ensuring the mechanical<br>
endurance life are required when decoupling elements are used. In the ideal case<br>
the plate holder according to the invention is able to replace the decoupling<br>
element and correspondingly save costs.<br>
Also where economy of weight is concerned, the supporting element<br>
according to the invention is superior to conventional brackets with vibration<br>
neutralizers: assuming that a conventional vibration neutralizer has a mass of<br>
approximately 1 kg, a comparable supporting element according to the invention<br>
weighs only approximately 250 g, including the console on the side of the exhaust<br>
system.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with the aid of<br>
embodiments with reference being made to the attached drawings.<br>

Figure 6 illusrates an exemplary installation situation of supporting elements<br>
according to Fig. 1 to 5.<br>
At first Fig. 1 is to be seen, showing an overview illustration of the bracket<br>
configured according to the invention and provided for the exhaust system.<br>
A combustior engine has an exhaust system 2 which is supplied via an exhaust<br>
manifold adapted 4 of an upstream pipe 3 from an exhaust manifold (not<br>
illustrated) with combustion gases, the exhaust system being fastened to the<br>
gearbox housing 5 by means of the supporting element 1 according to the<br>
invention in the form of a plate holder. The gearbox housing 5 is connected with<br>
the engine block through the engine block attachment 6. On the side of the<br>
exhaust system, the supporting element 1 is fastened to the exhaust system by<br>
means of a console 8, namely to the inlet funnel of the catalytic converter.<br>
Supporting element 1 and console 8 are connected by welding. On the side of the<br>
gearbox the supporting element 1 according to the invention is fastened to the<br>
gearbox housing 5 by a bracket 7. Fastening the supporting element 1 to the<br>
bracket 7 is effected by a screwed connection 9. The supporting element 1<br>
consists of three band-like, elastic plates which lie one on top of the other. As seen<br>
in the longitudinal section, the supporting element 1 has a twofold angula<br>
structure in the form of an offset step.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates in detail another embodiment of the supporting element 1 in<br>
the form of a plate holder. As can be taken from the upper picture of Fig. 2, a<br>
longitudinal section, the supporting element 1 is composed of three individual<br>
plates 10, 11 and 12. A single plate has the thickness d, with the height h of the<br>
supporting element 1 resulting from the thicknesses of the three individual plates.<br><br>
The lower picture in Fig. 2 shows a top view of the supporting element 1<br>
which has been assembled from stacked individual plates 10, 11, 12. The<br>
supporting element has a length 1 and a width b. Reference numeral 13 shows a<br>
point near one longitudinal end of the supporting element where the latter is<br>
connected to the motor- or gearbox housing, while reference numeral 14 shows a<br>
point near the other longitudinal end of the supporting element where the latter is<br>
connected to the exhaust system.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further advantageous embodiment of the supporting element<br>
according to the invention, for illustrating an angular structural shape of<br>
supporting element 1. In this embodiment and as seen in the longitudinal section,<br>
the supporting element 1 composed of two plates 15, 16 has a fourfold angular<br>
structure in the form of two offset steps which are arranged mirror-inverted to<br>
each other. The structure is angled at the corners 17, 18, 19 and 20. The ends of<br>
the supporting element show no offset, i.e. both ends of the structure are in the<br>
same plane.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further advantageous embodiment of the supporting element 1<br>
according to the invention, in which the individual plates 21, 22, 23 are fastened<br>
to each other by a flanged connection. In this arrangement, the plates 21, 22 are<br>
clamped at their front ends and, if appropriate, at their longitudinal sides by plate<br>
23 which is the exterior plate in the stack of supporting elements 1.<br>
Fig. 5 (upper picture) shows a top view of the supporting element according to<br>
the invention, for a schematic and only exemplary illustration of fastening points<br>
for a mutual fastening of the plates. Thus, it is possible for instance to join the<br>
plates at three fastening points on each of the two longitudinal sides. It is likewise<br>
possible to join the plates at two fastening points on each of the two longitudinal<br>
sides. It would likewise be possible to join the plates at only one fastening point<br>
on each of the two longitudinal sides, with this fastening point preferably being<br>
provided in the middle. At the front end of the plates, these could be fastened to<br>
each other by one single fastening point, for instance at the middle or at the right.<br><br>
hand or left-hand side. It is also possible that the plates are fastened to each other<br>
at their front ends by two fastening points in each case.<br>
Fig. 5, lower picture, shows an embodiment of the supporting element<br>
according to the invention in the longitudinal section, in which the plates have<br>
been fastened to each other on the longitudinal side by two fastening points at<br>
each end. Any form-fitting and force-fitting connections are permissible (e.g. spot<br>
welding, welding, riveting, screwing, brazing, gluing, magnet).<br>
Fig. 6 shows the installation situation of a supporting element 1, having the<br>
design explained above, in a schematically illustrated motor vehicle K. Apart from<br>
the design of the bracket for the exhaust system 2, this vehicle is constructed in a<br>
. manner known per se and has a front motor M with an associated radiator WK and<br>
a gearbox G. The exhaust system 2 includes, for example, an exhaust manifold<br>
AK, an upstream pipe 3, a catalytic converter Ka, a middle exhaust silencer MS<br>
and an end exhaust silencer ES with a tail pipe; the catalytic converter Ka being<br>
connected with the middle exhaust silencer MS and the latter being connected<br>
with the end exhaust silencer ES through exhaust pipes AR. In this respect, the<br>
motor vehicle K according to Fig. 6 corresponds to the well known prior art, so<br>
that no further explanation will be needed.<br>
Among others, a supporting element 1 with the construction explained above<br>
serves for supporting the exhaust system 2, by means of which supporting element<br>
the catalytic converter Ka is resiliently fastened to the gearbox housing 5.<br><br>
