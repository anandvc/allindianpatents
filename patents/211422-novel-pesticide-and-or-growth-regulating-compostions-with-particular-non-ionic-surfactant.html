THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL PESTICIDE AND/OR GROWTH REGULATING COMPOSTIONS WITH PARTICULAR NON-IONIC SURFACTANT'<br>
AVENTIS CROPSCIENCE S.A., a French body corporate of 55 Avenue Rene Cassin CP 106, F-69266 Lyon Cedex 09, FRANCE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
various compounds, such as, for example, fillers, stabilizing agents, emulsifying agents or surface-active agents, or other adjuvants or additives, are generally added thereto.<br>
5	In formulations or compositions of this type,<br>
said surface-active agents are generally chosen for their emulsifying and/or dispersing and/or stabilizing properties, for example to make possible improved behavior on storage.<br>
10	One field in which said surface-active agents<br>
can play a predominant role, when employed in compositions, is that of the application, in particular by spraying, of these compositions.<br>
Nevertheless, and despite the use of surface-<br>
15 active agents, the application of said compositions often comes up against the problem of the more or less wetting nature of the composition to be applied.<br>
Likewise, another problem frequently encountered during the application of compositions, for<br>
20 example by spraying, is the tendency of the droplets of said compositions applied to rebound from or to ricochet off the application surface and thus to result in a waste of composition and in a dispersion of composition in the environment, a dispersion to be<br>
25 avoided for easily understandable ecological reasons and for just as understandable economic reasons.<br>
Thus, one object of the present invention is to provide compositions which employ one or more<br><br>
pesticidal and/or growth-regulating active materials for harmful plants and/or insects and/or animals and which have a high wetting nature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to 5 provide compositions which employ one or more<br>
pesticidal and/or growth-regulating active materials and which make possible an application, in particular by spraying, of the most effective.<br>
An additional object of the present invention<br>
10 is to provide compositions which are of use in the fields of agriculture and/or of public or domestic hygiene and which have a reduced dynamic tension, which notion will be expanded upon subsequently.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
15 provide compositions which are of use in the fields of agriculture and/or of public or domestic hygiene and which have a substantially improved bioavailability of the pesticidal and/or growth-regulating active material employed.<br>
20	An additional object of the present invention<br>
is to provide pesticidal and/or growth-regulating compositions which employ a specific nonionic surface-active agent, it being possible for said compositions in particular to show good stability during long<br>
25 periods of storage and, thus, to make it possible for the active material employed to remain highly effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br><br>
provide protection and/or treatment methods, in<br>
particular for the protection and/or treatment of crops<br>
and/or seeds, employing the compositions according to<br>
the invention.<br>
5	An  additional object  of  the present  invention<br>
is to provide such methods with improved performances which make possible a reduction in the amount of active material applied, a particularly advantageous asset for easily understandable ecological reasons.<br>
10	Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a specific nonionic surface-active agent comprising several chemical components, said surface-active agent having a particularly advantageous wettability.<br>
15	Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a specific nonionic surface-active agent which exhibits a reduced dynamic tension.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is to provide a specific nonionic surface-active agent<br>
20 which can, for example, be advantageously employed in the presence of ionic substances, either anionic or cationic substances.<br>
It has now been found that these objectives can be achieved in all or part by virtue of the various<br>
25 aspects of the present invention, in particular by<br>
means of compositions according to the invention, or by means of a specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention, or via a process for<br><br>
employing said compositions or said surface-active agent; likewise, other subject matters or advantages of the present invention may become apparent during the detailed description to come of the various aspects of 5 said invention.<br>
An essential and very particularly preferred aspect of the present invention relates to pesticidal and/or growth-regulating compositions for harmful plants and/or insects and/or animals, of use in 10 particular in the fields of agriculture and/or of<br>
public or domestic hygiene, characterized in that they comprise<br>
A)	one or more pesticidal and/or growth-regulating<br>
active materials for harmful plants and/or insects<br>
15      and/or animals;<br>
B)	a specific nonionic surface-active agent<br>
comprising two different chemical components<br>
Bj) the molecular mass of which is between 200<br>
and 3 000 g/mol, preferably between 300 and<br>
20	1 000 g/mol;<br>
B2) the dynamic tension of which, measured in<br>
water at a concentration of 0.4 g per liter<br>
and at a frequency of 10 Hz, is between 35<br>
and 73 mN/m;<br>
25	B3) and each comprising<br>
B3(i) a hydrophobic part chosen from the following groups: C13 oxo alcohols; a-isodecyl-a-hydroxyisodecyl alcohol;<br><br>
linear C12-C14 alcohols; linear C16-C18<br>
alcohols; lauryl alcohol; myristyl<br>
alcohol; do- and/or tetradecanols;<br>
distyrylphenol-di(1-phenylethyl)phenols;<br>
5	nonylphenols; acetylenediols, in<br>
particular 2,4,7,9-tetramethyldeca-5-<br>
yne; tridecyl alcohols; and the molar<br>
mass of which is between 100 and<br>
1 500 g/mol, preferably between 150 and<br>
10	400 g/mol;<br>
B3(ii) a hydrophilic part chosen from a<br>
poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) radical and/or<br>
a poly(oxy-1,2-propanediyl) radical, the<br>
molar mass of which is between 80 and<br>
15	2 000 g/mol, preferably between 100 and<br>
900 g/mol; and such that<br>
B4) the difference in molar masses of the<br>
hydrophobic parts of these two chemical<br>
components is less than 140 g/mol; and that<br>
20	B5) the difference in molar masses of the<br>
hydrophilic parts of these two chemical components is less than 360 g/mol. Preferably, the active material or materials employed in the compositions according to the invention 25 are present in amounts generally of between 0.0001 and 99%, preferably between 0.5 and 7 0%, by weight of said compositions.<br>
Other advantageous forms of compositions<br><br><br>
according to the invention are the compositions in the dilute form; preferably, these dilute compositions comprise between 0.0001 and 10% of active material. Other even more advantageous forms of 5 compositions according to the invention are the<br>
compositions in the concentrated forms; preferably, these concentrated compositions comprise between 15 and 99% of active material.<br>
In a particularly advantageous way, the 10 specific nonionic surface-active agent employed in the compositions according to the invention is present in amounts generally of between 1 and 99.9999%, preferably between 5 and 80%, by weight of said compositions. Very advantageously, the two chemical 15 components comprised by the specific nonionic surface-active agent employed within the compositions according to the invention are generally present in respective amounts such that the molar ratio of said amounts is between 1/99 and 99/1, preferably between 25/75 and 20 75/25.<br>
However, a molar ratio of said amounts of between 40/60 and 60/40 is generally preferred.<br>
Throughout the present text and unless otherwise specified, the amounts of the various 25 constituents employed are expressed as percentage by weight.<br>
For greater clarity of the present account, various terms or expressions employed will now be<br><br>
defined.<br>
Thus, within the meaning of the present text, the following are generally understood<br>
-	by surface-active agent or compound, a<br>
5 compound, a mixture of compounds, an association or a combination of compounds which can have surface-active and/or wettability properties of use in particular for modifying, decreasing, increasing or controlling the surface tension of a composition according to the 10 invention, as well as for modifying, decreasing,<br>
increasing or controlling the wetting nature of such a composition;<br>
-	by surface tension or static surface<br>
tension of a composition according to the invention,<br>
15  the tension which can exist between the liquid surface of such a composition and the gas, generally air, surrounding and/or surmounting said surface; thus, the surface of said liquid acts as if it were a taut skin or as if such a taut skin existed at the liquid/gas or<br>
20 liquid/solid interface;<br>
-	by wetting nature or wettability property,<br>
expressions employed without distinction to describe<br>
the compositions according to the invention in the<br>
continuation of the present text, the ability of a<br>
25    droplet of composition,   deposited on the surface of a solid, to spread to a greater or lesser extent according to whether said composition wets or does not wet the solid;<br><br>
-	by dynamic tension or dynamic surface<br>
tension, the ability of a liquid composition, in<br>
particular of a composition according to the invention<br>
in combination with a liquid carrier, to make possible,<br>
5  in particular during the spraying of such a liquid composition, the faster or slower migration of said composition according to the invention to the water/air interface of the droplets formed; said dynamic tension or dynamic surface tension advantageously having a low 10 value, a guarantee in particular of a reduction in the losses of liquid composition applied, for example by spraying, said losses being generally due to the rebound of the droplets from the application surface;<br>
-	by bioavailability of the active material<br>
15 employed in a composition according to the invention,<br>
the available nature of said active material which renders it as effective as possible in its pesticidal and/or growth-regulating role for harmful plants and/or insects or animals; thus, for a fixed amount of active<br>
20 material, the biological activity of the latter can vary very widely according to said bioavailability of this active material in the composition employed.<br>
Generally, surface-active agents or compounds are chemical molecules, the structures of which<br>
25 generally comprise two parts with antagonistic<br>
properties with respect to the surrounding environment. Thus, said molecules generally comprise a part referred to as hydrophobic, as having little affinity for water,<br><br>
and a part referred to as hydrophilic, thus described for its high affinity for water. As said hydrophilic part can sometimes carry an electric charge, the surface-active agent is then often described as anionic 5 or cationic and, if appropriate, as nonionic surface-active agent when said hydrophilic part does not carry any ionic chemical group.<br>
Preferably and according to requirements, the nature of the diseases to be treated, of the harmful<br>
10  insects and/or animals and/or plants to be combated, destroyed or eradicated, according to the degrees of infestation by these pests, the climatic and/or edaphic conditions, the compositions according to the invention can comprise several pesticidal and/or growth-<br>
15 regulating active materials for harmful plants and/or insects and/or animals in combination, in particular of the following types: fungicide and/or insecticide and/or acaricide and/or rodenticide and/or nematocide and/or repellent for harmful insects and/or animals<br>
20 and/or growth regulator for plants and/or insects,<br>
and/or one or more active materials of herbicide type.<br>
Generally, the pesticidal and/or growth-regulating active material or materials which the compositions according to the invention can comprise<br>
25 are those cited in any general work on plant protection, for example L'Index Phytosanitaire (published by the technical department of the Association de Coordination Technique Agricole<br><br>
[Agricultural Technical Coordination Association] or<br>
A.C.T.A.) or The Pesticide Manual (of the British Crop<br>
Protection Council, edited by Clive Tomlin) or<br>
alternatively The Electronic Pesticide Manual, version 5 1.0 (of the British Crop Protection Council, edited by<br>
Clive Tomlin).<br>

15 components which the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention comprises are generally present in respective amounts such that the molar ratio of said amounts is between 1/99 and 99/1, preferably between 25/75 and 75/25.<br>
20	However, preference is generally given to a<br>
molar ratio of said amounts of between 40/60 and 60/40.<br>
Furthermore, and according to requirements, the application conditions targeted or according to the targeted wettability and/or spreading properties, or<br>
25 according to the associated compounds, or according to the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention itself, said surface-active agent according to the invention can be employed alone or a<br><br>
carrier, in particular an inorganic or organic liquid<br>
carrier, can be added thereto.<br>
However, solid carriers can advantageously be<br>

invention; mention may particularly be made, among<br>
these said solid carriers, of clays; natural or<br>
synthetic silicates; silica; resins; waxes; or solid<br>
fertilizers.<br>
10	Very advantageously, said carrier is as<br>
described above.<br>
In particular, said inorganic or organic<br>
liquid carrier can just as easily be a solvent employed<br>
alone as a combination of several solvents. Such a 15 combination then being composed of a solvent and of one<br>
or more cosolvents which are miscible or immiscible<br>
with one another.<br>
Use may advantageously be made, as solvents<br>
optionally employed with the specific nonionic surface-20 active agent according to the invention, of water<br>
and/or organic solvents.<br>
Said optionally employed organic solvents can<br>
then be protic or aprotic organic solvents, among which<br>

Even if the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention has been described by some of its advantageous or preferred forms, in<br>
15 particular by the presence of two different chemical components, said surface-active agent according to the invention can also comprise one or more other additional chemical components as described above.<br>
The qualities of wettability of the specific<br>
20 nonionic surface-active agent according to the<br>
invention can advantageously be employed in numerous fields and particularly advantageously in fields requiring the application of active materials or compounds to solid surfaces, as well as in fields<br>
25 requiring efficient spreading of an active material or of any other compound, as well as for fields requiring good quality of dispersion of active compounds or materials, in particular within a large volume of<br><br>
surrounding liquid.<br>
More generally, the fields which make possible advantageous use of the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention can be<br>
5 classified into two families, on the one hand fields requiring the application or the spreading, in particular of a liquid, to or over a solid surface, on the other hand fields for which active materials or products, compositions or formulations which have to<br>
10 have a high wetting nature are employed.<br>
Thus, mention may very particularly be made, among said fields for which the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention can advantageously be employed, in combination with an<br>
15 active material or any other compound, or within an application process comprising the preparation at the time of use of the composition or formulation to be applied, of the fields of agriculture and/or of public or domestic hygiene but also the fields of ceramics; of<br>
20 printing; of textiles; of the paper industry; of detergency; of cosmetics; of body hygiene and of beauty; of galenicals, in particular pharmaceutical or veterinary products; and the like.<br>
Likewise, mention may be made of numerous<br>
25 active principles, materials or products, compositions or formulations which can advantageously be used in combination with the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention, for example<br><br>
pesticidal and/or growth-regulating compounds; paints or other coatings; pigments or colorants, in particular inks, paints or varnishes; dyes; adhesives; detergents; shampoos, soaps or other beauty products; 5 pharmaceutical or veterinary products; and the like. Furthermore, the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention can, in a particularly advantageous way, be employed to make possible the preparation of compositions or<br>
10 formulations based on an active material which has low solubility in water and thus to significantly reduce the use, and consequently the dispersion into the environment, of organic solvents or products.<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention<br>
15 lies in the use of the pesticidal and/or growth-regulating compositions for harmful plants and/or insects and/or animals according to the invention, as described and defined above, in treatment and/or protection methods or processes of use in particular in<br>
20 the field of agriculture, for example for the treatment or protection of crops, and/or in the field of public or domestic hygiene.<br>
Thus, and in particular according to the pesticidal and/or growth-regulating active material or<br>
25 materials used, said compositions can be employed to protect, treat, combat, destroy or eradicate diseases or harmful fungi, plants, insects or animals. An essential characteristic of said<br><br>
protection and/or treatment methods, in particular for<br>
the protection and/or treatment of crops, is to employ<br>
an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of a composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
5	The expression effective and non-phytotoxic<br>
amount is understood to mean an amount of the composition according to the invention which is sufficient to make it possible to protect, treat, combat, destroy or eradicate diseases or harmful fungi,<br>
10 plants, insects or animals present or capable of<br>
appearing on crops and which does not result, for the said crops, in any significant symptom of phytotoxicity.<br>
Such an amount is capable of varying within<br>
15 wide limits, in particular according to the disease or harmful fungi, plants, insects or animals to be combated, destroyed or eradicated, according to the type of crop to be treated or protected, or according to the climatic or edaphic conditions, or according to<br>
20 the active material or materials present in the composition according to the invention used.<br>
Nevertheless, when employed in such protection and/or treatment methods, the compositions according to the invention are generally applied, in<br>
25 particular by spraying, in amounts of between 0.0001 and 20 kg, preferably between 0.002 and 2 kg, per hectare of crop to be treated and/or protected.<br>
As regards the treatments of seeds, the<br><br>
amounts of compositions according to the invention employed are usually between 0.01 and 250 kg/T of seeds; a person skilled in the art will know how to adapt said proportions, in particular according to the 5  type or the size of the seeds, or according to the type of treatment envisaged or of protection envisaged.<br>
Advantageously, and as regards their use in the processes according to the invention which have just been described, the compositions according to the<br>
10 invention can form the subject of quite a number of application techniques; in particular, said compositions can be applied by dipping, covering or coating, or by spraying or by fogging, and the like. As regards the various ways of applying the<br>
15 compositions according to the invention which can be envisaged, mention may in particular be made of simultaneous, separate, alternating or sequential applications; the methods of applications of the processes according to the invention then comprising<br>
20 technical stages of the same nature as those which were described above.<br>
Generally, the methods or processes for the protection and/or treatment of crops according to the invention which employ the compositions according to<br>
25 the invention do so by application, particularly by spraying, to the aerial parts of said crops, it being possible for said aerial parts to be, without distinction, the leaves or the stems.<br><br>
Nevertheless, many other application techniques can be employed for the application of said compositions according to the invention; there is in particular fogging but also application by dipping in 5 said compositions; or by coating or by covering by means of a composition according to the invention.<br>
Due to the very large number of active materials capable of being employed in the compositions according to the invention, the latter can in fact be<br>
10 employed in processes for the treatment or protection of numerous types of crops.<br>
Mention may be made, as examples, and without implied limitation, of crops which can be protected and/or treated using compositions according to the<br>
15 invention, of rice, cereals, in particular wheat,<br>
maize, rye, triticale or barley, fruit trees, the vine, oleaginous plants, including rape and sunflower, peas, market gardening crops, the Solanaceae, in particular potatoes, as well as cotton, flax, beetroot and<br>
20 ornamental plants and forest trees.<br>
The methods or processes for the treatment and/or protection of plant propagation products, and the resulting plants, against diseases or harmful fungi, plants, insects or animals also form part of the<br>
25 present invention, said methods generally being<br>
characterized in that said products or plants to be treated and/or protected are coated, in all or part, with an effective and non-phytotoxic dose of a<br><br>
composition according to the invention, or any other biological propagation material.<br>
Mention may in particular be made, among said products for the propagation of the plants concerned, 5 of seeds, tubers or in-vitro plants.<br>
Said methods for the treatment or protection of plant propagation products according to the invention give particularly satisfactory results when they are applied to seeds, in particular in that they 10 can make possible a substantial reduction in the amount of active material used.<br>
Another characteristic of the treatment and/or protection methods according to the invention is to be able to be employed in the field of public or 15 domestic hygiene, particularly by application of an effective amount of a pesticidal and/or growth-regulating composition according to the invention.<br>
It being possible for said application to give particularly satisfactory results when it employs 20 amounts of said compositions of between 0.00001 g and 500 g, preferably between 0.001 g and 200 g, of composition according to the invention per 100 m2 of surface area to be treated and/or protected.<br>
Very advantageously, and according to an 25 additional aspect of the present invention, the<br>
specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention can be employed in treatment and/or protection methods, alone or in combination with a<br><br>
carrier as described above, in particular during the preparation at the time of use of compositions according to the invention.<br>
Thus employed, said specific nonionic 5 surface-active agent is generally used in amounts of between 0.0001 and 99%, preferably between 1 and 90%, by weight of composition or of product which may be associated with it or with which it may be mixed. It goes without saying that, even if the<br>
10 various aspects of the present invention have been able, in some cases, to be described by specific characteristics or else according to advantageous or preferred forms, it should be noted that the account of said aspects by said specific characteristics or under<br>
15 advantageous or preferred forms is given only by way of example and that numerous alternative forms of the details of said aspects of the invention, in particular of preparation, of use or of combination, can be envisaged without departing either from the spirit or<br>

with mixing.<br>
25	The object of examples 2a to 2i which will<br>
follow is to illustrate various specific processes for treatment or protection according to the invention by means of pesticidal compositions according to the<br><br>
invention.<br>
Example 2a:<br>
The intention of this example is to illustrate a specific process for application by foliar 5 spraying of an insecticidal composition according to the invention.<br>
This example also makes possible a perfect illustration of the ability of the pesticidal compositions according to the invention to make 10 possible effective and advantageous wetting of the leaves of the treated plants.<br>
This wetting nature of said compositions is evaluated by contact angle measurements.<br>
The contact angle, expressed in degrees, is 15 an important characteristic of a liquid which makes it possible in particular to measure the wetting nature of said liquid applied to a solid surface, particularly in that the value of this contact angle, measured for a droplet of said liquid, decreases in proportion as the 20 wetting power of the liquid increases. Said<br>
measurements can be carried out by means of any<br>
apparatus known for such usages and under conditions<br>
which a person skilled in the art will know how to<br>
determine easily.<br>
25	For the purpose of carrying out these contact<br>
angle measurements, a liquid insecticidal composition according to the invention is prepared by mixing 1 g of a solid composition according to example If with one<br><br>
liter of water.<br>
In the same way, a control insecticidal<br>
composition not comprising surface-active agent<br>
according to the invention is prepared.<br>
5	The measurement proper of the contact angles<br>
is carried out by depositing, by spraying, a droplet of 2 jil of liquid composition to be characterized on a leaf of wheat, of Scypion  variety, grown in a climate-controlled chamber for 14 days at 10°C and by then<br>
10 measuring the contact angle which the droplet forms with the solid surface of the leaf.<br>
The control insecticidal composition has a contact angle measured at 102°, whereas the insecticidal composition according to the invention,<br>
15 comprising the specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention, has a contact angle of 50.3°, a value testifying in an exemplary way to the particularly advantageous wetting nature of said insecticidal composition according to the invention.<br>

effective and advantageous wetting of the leaves of the treated plants.<br>
During a first stage, a herbicidal composition in the form of a soluble concentrate, and 5 known per se, is prepared. For this, 8 g of a wetting agent in the form of a polyethoxylated fatty alcohol, 20 g of a salt of a polyethoxylated tristyrylphenol phosphate, as dispersing agent, 50 g of propylene glycol, as antifreeze agent, 1 g of a silicone 10 antifoaming agent and 500 g of Diflufenican, with the chemical name 2',4'-difluoro-2-(a,a,a-trifluoro-m-tolyloxy)nicotinanilide, as herbicidal compound, are mixed in 400 g of water.<br>
A second stage consists in milling the 15 mixture obtained above in order to reduce the particle size thereof in order to obtain a mean diameter of the particles of approximately 2µm.<br>
Finally, during a third stage, 4 g of a silicone antifoaming agent and 60 g of a thickening and 20 biocidal compound, in the form of a solution comprising 2% of xanthan and of a biocidal agent, are added.<br>
Finally, and at the time of use, a herbicidal composition according to the invention is prepared by mixing 1 g of the composition thus obtained with one 25 liter of water and with 1 g of surface-active agent<br>
according to the invention comprising equimolar amounts of the products sold under the names Rhodasurf 870  and Rhodasurf 860/P   [poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)(C13 oxo<br><br>
alcohol and a-isodecyl-a)-hydroxyisodecyl alcohol)].<br>
The contact angle measurements are carried out as for example 2a by measuring the contact angle of droplets of the herbicidal composition according to the 5 invention prepared at the time of use and of droplets of a control composition not comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention.<br>
The contact angle measurements are carried<br>
10 out on leaves of catchweed, also known as Gallium aparine.<br>
The control herbicidal composition has a contact angle measured at 93.5°, whereas the herbicidal composition according to the invention, comprising the<br>
15 specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention, has a contact angle of 48.3°, a value testifying in an exemplary fashion to the particularly advantageous wetting nature of said insecticidal composition according to the invention.<br>

20	The intention of this example is to<br>
illustrate a specific process for application by foliar spraying of an insecticidal composition according to the invention.<br><br>
This example also makes possible a perfect illustration of the ability of this specific insecticidal composition according to the invention to make possible effective and advantageous wetting of the 5 leaves of the treated plants.<br>
For the preparation of the specific<br>
insecticidal composition according to the invention<br>
which has to be sprayed, 1 g of composition according<br>
to example If is mixed with one liter of water.<br>
10	A control insecticidal composition not<br>
comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention is prepared in the same way.<br>
The contact angle measurements are carried<br>
out using the conditions of example 2a.<br>
15	The control insecticidal composition has a<br>
contact angle measured at 110°, whereas the insecticidal composition comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention has a contact angle measured at 51°, a value testifying in an 20 exemplary fashion to the particularly advantageous wetting nature of said insecticidal composition according to the invention. Example 2f:<br>
The intention of this example is to 25 illustrate a specific process for application by foliar spraying of a liquid insecticidal composition according to the invention.<br>
This example illustrates the ability of an<br><br>
insecticidal composition according to the invention to be advantageously retained at the surface of the leaf of the treated plant after spraying.<br>
For the preparation of the specific liquid 5 and colored insecticidal composition according to the invention which has to be sprayed, 1 g of a composition according to example If is mixed in one liter of water while adding an additional coloring ingredient in the form of 0.5 g of carmoisine, a substance known for its<br>
10 coloring properties.<br>
A control liquid and colored insecticidal composition not comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention is prepared in the same way.<br>
15	After spraying, the amount of insecticidal<br>
composition according to the invention and of control insecticidal composition which is retained on the leaves of the treated plants is evaluated. Colorimetric quantitative determination is used for this and the<br>
20 volume of each composition present per gram of treated plant then analyzed is measured.<br>
These measurements produce the following results: the plants treated by means of the insecticidal composition according to the invention<br>
25 retain 10.2 M1 of composition per gram of treated plant; whereas the plants treated by means of the control insecticidal composition retain only 4.4 /il of composition per gram of treated plant.<br><br>
These results therefore make possible an illustration of the advantage of using such an insecticidal composition according to the invention for making possible greater retention of said composition<br>
5 on the surface of the treated plant leaf and thus making possible a higher productivity and a higher effectiveness of the insecticidal active material employed, as well as an advantageous reduction in the amount of composition needlessly spread or lost to the<br>
0 surroundings, in particular by rebound from the surface of the leaf at the time of spraying. Example 2g:<br>
The intention of this example is to illustrate a specific process for application of an<br>
5 insecticidal composition according to the invention for the coating of seeds.<br>
This example also illustrates the advantageous ability of a specific insecticidal composition according to the invention to make possible<br>
0 highly satisfactory coating of said seeds. For this, use is made of an insecticidal composition according to example lc and of a control insecticidal composition not comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention.<br>
5	For the preparation of the composition<br>
according to the invention to be applied, 31 ml of a composition according to example lc are mixed with 69 ml of water.<br><br>
In the same way, 31 ml of a control<br>
insecticidal composition not comprising specific<br>
nonionic surface-active agent according to the<br>
invention are mixed with 69 ml of water.<br>
5	After preparation of these two compositions,<br>
the latter form the subject of a comparison of their ability to make possible efficient coating by application to wheat seeds of the variety Rubeins. Thus, 8 ml of each insecticidal composition are applied<br>
10 using a Hege bowl, a device known for making possible the treatment of seeds, to two batches of 1 kg of said seeds. The proportions thus employed correspond to the application of 2.5 1 of composition according to example lc per tonne of seeds to be treated or<br>
15 protected. After application to the seeds, the statistical distribution of each of these two insecticidal compositions to be evaluated is studied by following the recommendations of the CIPAC MT175 standard described in the work CIPAC Handbook, vol. F:<br>
20 Physico-chemical methods for technical and formulated pesticides, edited by W. Dobrat and A. Martijn.<br>
The evaluation technique employed leads to a coefficient of variation which describes, for each of the two insecticidal composition employed, the<br>
25 uniformity of the distribution over the seeds. Thus,<br>
the lower this coefficient, the better the distribution of the composition over all the treated seeds, making possible greater effectiveness of the amount of active<br><br>
material employed in the composition used.<br>
Thus, as regards the insecticidal composition according to the invention, said coefficient of variation is 30%, while it is 53% for the control 5 insecticidal composition not comprising specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the invention.<br>
Thus, the ability which the surface-active agent which is a subject matter of the invention has to 10 make possible better wetting and better coating of the treated seeds is fully assessed. Example 2h:<br>

25	The procedure is as for example 2g as regards<br>
the application and measurement conditions.<br>
The following results were obtained: with the fungicidal composition according to the invention, the<br><br>
coefficient of variation is 28%, while it is 50% for<br>
the control fungicidal composition not comprising<br>
specific nonionic surface-active agent according to the<br>
invention.<br>
5	Yet again, the ability which the surface-<br>
active agent which is a subject matter of the invention has to make possible better wetting and better coating of the treated seeds, in particular of part the uniformity of this coating, is thus fully assessed.<br>
