				<td>PNEUMATIC TEA LEAF HARVESTER<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of agriculture technology. More particularly this invention relates to harvesting machine. Precisely this invention relates to a pneumatic tea leaf harvester (TLH) which is very efficient and productive. Normally tea leaf is harvested by hand plucking/shearing <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The following description explain in detail the state of art, the problem associated with the state of art and the solution offered by inventor.<br>
Plucking is the process of harvesting ready crop (tea leaves). It is the only agricultural operation that fetches revenue for a tea plantation.<br>
In the early years of tea industry, all field work was done by manual labour. A large labour force was needed, particularly for plucking. If labour was not available locally, labourers were imported - for example, Tamils from India to Ceylon. Many estates provided housing for labourers who lived on the estates, often for several generations, particularly, where harvesting continued throughout the year. In recent years, the cost of labour has increased, both directly as wages and indirectly by improvement of workers' facilities.  Harvesting was found to account for 60% of the<br><br>
total labour and often such labour as is available is not very efficient. In these conditions, mechanisation of field operations became an attractive alternative. There are contradictory reports about increase and fall in yield due to the introduction of mechanical harvesting. The need to improve mechanical harvesting arose to do away with such contradictions.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The main objectives of this invention are (i) to harvest ready shoots and maximise yield, maintaining quality and productivity (ii) to effectively utilise land productivity (iii) to reduce labour. While the invention is deployed for achieving the above objectives, the policies observed are: long term profitability, sustained productivity, maintenance of tea bush health, quality produce and increase in volume of production.<br>
CONVENTIONAL TYPE OF HARVESTING :<br>
I	Hand Plucking :<br>
Advantages :<br>
Hand plucking is the most selective method of harvesting. It enables complete removal of dormant shoots and harvest of ready shoots; ensures leaf quality and causes minimal damage to green leaves.<br>
Disadvantages :<br>
Hand plucking is very labour intensive and has lower productivity.<br><br>
II        Mechanical Harvesting : Advantages :<br>
The results of various experiments carried out by various people from various countries with machines like "Tarpen Cropper" by Fay in Ceylon, show that the tea, under mechanisation, improves in spread and density, to such an extent as to make passage through it difficult, giving the field an almost unbroken sheet of tea undulating to every contour and steep or gentle slope. Moreover, the accurate slope plucking and increased spread obtained by mechanisation have reduced wind damage and weed growth; making of better soil cover, more efficient crop protection and reduced weeding costs.<br>
Disadvantages :<br>
The total photosynthesis is reduced by 30% on account of the damage to stems from machine plucking. Lower concentrations of carbo-hydrates and proteins in mechanically harvested leaves have been reported. The quality of tea from machine plucking is lower than from good hand plucking due to non-selectivity by machines whereby immature and overgrown leaves are included. The leaves too are often more damaged.<br>
It has been ascertained that the following prior Indian Patent Specifications in connection with the present invention are available. A brief analysis of these specifications are as follows :<br><br>
1.	Specification No.9360 relating to "A tea plucking or cutting machine for<br>
cutting off the essential leaves or flush, from tea bushes".<br>
The above Specification No.9360 claims a tea plucking or cutting machine which has a tray and a rotating series of cutting blades similar to a lawn mower at its front edge. One man carries and pushes the machine over the top surface of the bushes whilst a second man works a cranked handle at the side which being rotated like a handle of a sewing machine, causes the mowing blades to rotate and the leaf to be severed.<br>
Drawback : This type of machine is too big and requires two men to work them. It is difficult to operate it where the bushes are close together in long rows.<br>
2.	Specification No. 14338 relating to "Improvements in or relating to machines<br>
for and methods of plucking tea leaf.<br>
The above Specification No. 14338 claims a hand operable plucking machine for tea leaf adapted to be carried by an operator, comprising a tray or receptacle to catch the severed leaf, a series of sharpened prongs or projections on the leading edge of said tray or receptacle, preferably level with the bottom surface thereof to engage the leaf, a rotatable disc with cutting teeth thereon adapted to co-operate with said sharpened prongs or projections  and,  when rotated  whilst  advancing or  pushing  the machine<br><br>
against the leaf at the same time, to operate to sever the leaf, means to remove the severed leaf onto the tray or into the receptacle and means to enable the cutting disc to be rotated.<br>
Drawback : In this method, the efficacy of severing the ready shoots is low as it requires the shoots to be positioned exactly between the fixed and the movable discs. The weight of the machine is too much for an operator to work continuously for a period of time.<br>
3.        Specification No.173918 relating to "Shears for use in Tea Plantations".<br>
The above Specification No. 173918 claims shears for use in tea plantations comprising a pair of cutting knife blades attached to handles characterised by a receptacle fitted to one of the blades; a pusher and leveller fitted to the other blade; a variable step-up plate for adjusting the distance between the bottom of the receptacle and the plane of the blades.<br>
Drawback : The operator has to use manual force which is tiring and thereby less productive.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a novel pneumatic Tea Leaf Harvester which is unique.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel pneumatic Taa Leaf Harvester which will harvest ready shoots and maximise yield.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel pneumatic Taa Leaf Harvester which will effectively utilise land productivity.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel pneumatic Taa Leaf Harvester which will reduce the labour force.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
The present invention is pneumatically operated thus making the harvesting easier, more effective and more productive. The operator's fatigue is dramatically reduced as compared to the conventional manual shear harvester.<br>
Now the invention will be described in the following specification. The description will be with reference to drawings accompanying the specification. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed is clearly described in the complete specification.<br>
The present invention is described in relation to the accompanying drawings by referring to one of the various possible embodiments thereof, wherein :<br><br>

WORKING OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The control valve (CV) is shown in Figure Bl in its exploded form. Connector 1 is bolted with an O-ring 2 of two steel balls 3 to the main body of the control valve (CV). In the control valve (CV), there is an operating handle 18.<br>
When this handle 18 is depressed, parts 5 to 11 are compressed and air through the outlet connector is released to the actuating cylinder (AC).<br>
The actuating cylinder (AC) as shown in figure CI has a connecting piston rod 23. Parts 24 to 27 are bolted to the top end of the connecting piston rod 23. Spring 22 is fitted to the bottom end of the connecting piston rod 23. The compressed air passing through the outlet connector of the control valve (CV) is released to the inlet connector of the actuating cylinder (AC). The compressed air now moves the connecting piston rod 23 with parts 24 to 27 downwards thereby activating the<br><br><br>
Moving blade (MB) which cuts the tea leaves. The guide plate (GP) riveted to the moving blade (MB) pushes the cut leaves into the perforated tray (T) attached to the fixed blade (FB)  When the handle 18 is released, parts 5 to 11 come back to their original position and air is cut off to the outlet connector of the control valve (CV) <br>
Thus the operation of cutting the leaves is repeated as the operator presses and releases the handle 18.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described but it is understood that various other embodiments of the invention proposed herein are possible without depending on the scope and ambit of this invention.<br>
