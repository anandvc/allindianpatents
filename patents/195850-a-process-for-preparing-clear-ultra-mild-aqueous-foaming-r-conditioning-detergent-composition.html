				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing clear, ultra mild, aqueous foaming and conditioning detergent composition.<br>
The instant invention is generally directed to novel, ultra mild "2-in-1" conditioning aqueous detergent products, including shampoos, antidandruff shampoos, and a variety of body care products, such as shower gels, liquid soaps- with and without antibacterial agents,   facial cleansers, baby washes, baby shampoos and the like, having detersive surfactant systems based upon use of balanced molar proportions of the essential anionic detergent, anionic hydrotropic sulfonate or sulfate, amphoteric detergent and cationic conditioner ingredients.   The desired balance is achieved by having the sum (on a molar basis) of the anionic detergent and hydrotropic sulfonate/sulfate substantially equal to the sum (on a molar basis) of the amphoteric detergent and any cationic conditioner ingredient. The resultant novel aqueous detergent products deliver excellent cleansing and foaming properties without irritation to skin and hair; provide true 2-in- conditioning properties to the hair and skin; and are lower in cost than current *2-in-1 products. A further benefit is that these detergents are in solution form and are crystal clear, although , if desired, they can be opacified.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently, commercially available, *2-in-1" or conditioning shampoos, are optically opaque. This is due to the fact that the conditioning agents incorporated therein are essentially water insoluble. For example, when high-molecular weight silicone derivatives are added to achieve the conditioning benefits, it has been found that H is difficult to formulate silicone-containing shampoos that are stable and do not suffer from the separating out of the silicone ingredient. The most accepted way to incorporate these silicone conditioning agents in such conditioning shampoos is to disperse, suspend, or emulsify them, which results in the opacification of these products and sometimes results in unstable products due to the separation of the emulsified or suspended silicone.<br>
 While the above-described "2-in-l" conditioning shampoos have achieved a great deal of<br>
success in the marketplace, such products suffer, at least among a certain segment of consumers,<br>
negative attributes of poor appearance, decreased foam, reduced viscosity, and physical instability<br>
because the conditioning materials therein are not completely dissolved. The patent literature relating<br>
to detergent compositions which include water-insoluble, hair and skin conditioning matenals reflects a<br>
variety of approaches designed to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages. More specifically,<br>
the patent literature teaches a vanety of agents that disperse, suspend, or emulsify such conditioning<br>
agents. For example, U.S. 4,741,855 to Grote et a! teaches the use of long chain (C16-C22) acyl<br>
derivatives, such as ethylene gfycoi distearate or long chain (C16-C22) amine oxides, as suspending<br>
agents U.S. 5,152.914 to Forster et al teaches the use of suspending agents chosen from<br>
polyethylene gfycoi mono- or diesters of C16-C22 fatty acids having from 2 to 7 ethylene oxide groups.<br>
Also, U.S. 4,997,641;  U.S. 5,106.613;  U.S. 5.213,716; U.S. 5,346,642;  and U.S. 5.348.736. all<br>
assigned to the assignee of the instant invention, disclose the use of long chain (C24-C45) alcohols<br>
and ethoxyiated alcohols as suspending agents. Alternatively, U.S. 4,559.227 to Chandra et al<br>
discloses conditioning shampoos in the form of clear solutions where*) blends of amme-functionaJ<br>
sdoxane polymers and nonioruc surfactants of the aikanoiamide or amine oxide type are dissolved in<br>
aqueous solutions containing typical anionic and amphoteric detergents used in shampoos. However,<br>
the commercial availability of the latter compositions has not been assessed.<br>
Now it has been found that it is possible to formulate aqueous detergent compositions<br>
containing balanced molar proportions of anionic, amphoteric and catioc ingredients that are crystal<br>
clear (although they can be opacified if desired) which exhibit true '2-in-1 conditioning properties.<br>
Furthermore, the resultant compositions are ultra mild and thus do not cause imtation to skin or hair.<br>
Additionally, these compositions are high foaming, and can be manufactured in a more cost-effective<br>
and lass energy intensive manner than the commercially available silicone-containing conditioning<br>
shampoos, which are in emulsion, suspension or dispersion form<br>
It is recognized that the pnor art discloses compositions containing essentially equimolar<br>
quantities of anionic surfactant and amphoteric surfactant   For example, U S 3,950,417 of Verdicchio<br>
 et al discloses a shampoo containing nonionic surfactant, a surfactant betaine and an anionic surfactant<br>
wherein the molar ratio of betaine to anionic is from 0 9 1 to 1 1 1    However, the nonionic detergent is<br>
the pnncipal surfactant in the preferred compositions which of necessity exhibit reduced foaming<br>
Similarly, U S 4,246,131 of Lohr discloses a low irritant, clear composition containing an equimolar<br>
mixture of surfactant betaine and alkonalomine neutralized, anionic, alkyl sulfate detergent   However,<br>
the poor art composrttons do not indude water-insoluble conditioning agents or anionic hydrotropic<br>
sulfonates/sulfates and do not recognize the need for balanced molecular proportions of the anionic,<br>
amphoteric and cationic ingredients therein   Therefore, said compositions should not provide effective<br>
hair and skin conditioning benefits<br>
On the other hand, European Application EP 0 294 894 A2 discloses an ion pair complex of an anionic surfactant, an alkyl amine and a wax as a conditioning agent and discloses anionic surfactant based shampoos containing said complex as a conditioning agent   However, again there is no recognition of the need for balanced molar proportions of anionic, amphoteric and cationic ingredients in the final composition   Thus, the need still exists for a clear, ultra mild, foaming, conditioning composition<br>
SUMMARY OFTHF INVENTION<br>
As described above, the present invention primary resides in the discovery that foaming and conditioning compositions which are mild can be prepared in the form of clear liquids if balanced molecular proportions of selected anionic detergents, anionic sulfonate/sulfate hydrotropes, amphoteric surfactants and water-insoluble cationic, hair and skin conditioning agents are employed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention Anionic Detergents The suitable anionic detergents are employed in the form of their water-soluble salts and the salt forming cation usually is selected from the group consoling or sodium, potassium, ammonium and mono-, dl- and tri- C2-C3 aJkarttiarnmonnim, with the sodium and arnrnoruum cations bong preferred.<br>
The suitable anionic detergents include the following:<br>
1	The CQ-C 18 aikyl ether ethenoxy sulfates of the formula<br>
fl(OC2H4)nOS03M where*) n is 1 to 5. These sulfates differ from the primary aikyl sulfate detergent in the number of moles of ethylene oxide (1-5) reacted with one mole of afcanoJ in forming the ethoxyiated aikanoi which is sulfated and neutralized to form this anionic detergent.  Preferred aikyl ether ethenoxy sulfates contain 12 to 16 carbon atoms in the aikyl group and contain two to three ethylene oxide groups per mole of alkanol.<br>
2.	The C8-C18 alkyl sulfates which are usually obtained by sulfating C&amp;-Cis alkanols<br>
obtained by reducing the gfycendes of tallow or coconut 01!   Preferred aikyl sulfates contain 10 to 16 carbons in the aikyl group.<br>
3.	The O-C8-C18 acyl isethionates may be produced by neutralizing the reaction<br>
product of a C8-C18 a alkanoic aad with 2-hydroxyethanesuffonic acid. Similar to the sarcosines and taunnes vhe preferred isethionates contain 12 to 14 carbon atoms in an aryl group obtained by reduction of coconut oil.<br>
4	The C10-C20 paraffin sulfonates obtained, for example, by reacting an alpha-olefin<br>
with bisulfite. Preferred aikane sulfonates contain 13 to 17 carbon atoms in the alkyl group.<br>
5.	The C10-C22 olefin sulfonates which may be obtained by sulfating the appropriate<br>
olefin. Preferred olefin sulfonates contain from 14 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and are obtained by sulfonating an aipha-olefin.<br>
While mixtures of the foregoing anionic detergents may be employed, the preferred anionic detergents are the alkyl ethenoxy ether sulfates and the alkyl sulfates.<br>
The proportion of the anionic detergent in the claimed compositions generally will be in the range of about 2% to about 14% by weight preferably in the range of 4% to 11% by weight ana most preferably in the range of 6% to 8% by weight.<br>
Other Anmnm Surfactant In addition to the anionic detergent discussed above, the described inventive compositions include anionic, hydrotropc C1-C3 alkyl substituted benzene sulfonates and C5-C3 alkyl sulfates. These materials are dassrfied as surfactant-hydrotropes and serve to sotubriize the anionic and amphoteric detergent in the aqueous medium. Also, it is believed that these materials assist in removing sod from the substrates being cleaned. Usually, these materials are used in the form of the* water soluble sodium, potassium and ammonium salts. Suitable hydrotropic sulfonate and sulfate salts include the salts of toluene sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, cumene sulfonate, C5- C6 alkyl sulfate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The proportion of the hydrotropic sulfonate or sulfate material generally will be in the range of about 0.5% to about 5% by weight of the resultant composition   Preferably the range of this material will be about 0 5% or 1% to 4% by weight of the final composition<br>
Amp Generaily, the amphoteric surfactant components will be selected from the group consisting of C8-C1 8 alkyl betames and suifobetaines, and C8-C18 alkyl amphoacetates and propionates   The<br>
suitable betames and suifobetaines have the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein   R-i B an alkyl group having 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, preferably 10 to 16 carbon atoms or<br>
the amido radical:<br>
(Formula Removed) wheretn RCO is an acyl group having 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and a is the nteger 1 to 4: R2 and R3 are each alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and preferably 1 carbon; R4 ts an alkyiene or hydroxyalkylene grc'jp having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and optionally, one hydroxy! group; and X is an anion selected from the group consisting of SO3* and COO" Typical betames and amido alkyl betames include decyl dimethyl betame or 2-(N-decyl-N,N-dimethylammonio) acetate, cocodimethyl betame or 2-(N-coco-N,N-methylammono) acetate, mynstyl dimethyl betame, palmrtyl dimethyl betaine, lauryl dimethyl betame, cefyl dimethyl betaine. stearyi dimethyl betame, cocoamidopropyl dimethyl betame and laurylmidoethyt dimethyl betaine. Typical suifobetaines or suttames simdany include cooodtmethyt sulfobetaine, or 3-<n-coco-n propane-1 sulfonate mynstyl dimethyl sulfobetaine lauryl cocoamidoethylsulfobetaine and cocanrvdo-propylhydroxy suttaine.></n-coco-n>
Other suitable amphoteric detergents are the C8-Cl8 alkyl amphoacetates and propionates<br>
corresponding to the following formula: (Formula Removed) <br><br>
wherein RC(O) tsa C8 -C18acyl group, R2 is a  C1-C2 aikyl group and M is a salt forming group such as<br>
sodium or potassium. A substitute for the described amphoacetate or amphopropionate compound is<br>
sodium cocoamphohydroxypropyl sulfonate   Sodium cocoamphoaetate is a preferred matenai.<br>
The proportion of the amphoteric detergent generally will be in the range of about 2.5% to about 21 % by weight 0/ the final composition.   Preferably the proportion of amphoteric surfactant will be selected from the range of about 4% to about 13% by weight and most preferably from the range of about 6% to about 10% by weight of the final composition.<br>
In the preferred composrtions, the proportion of the detergent mixture will be from about 8% to 28% by weight of the composition; and in the most preferred composrtions the proportion of said detergent mixture will be from 13% to 22% by weight.<br>
Conditioning Agonta<br>
The essential water-insoluble conditioning agent which is employed in the inventive cornpositions is soluble in the above-described aqueous detersive surfactant mixture and generaly wfl be selected from the group consisting of (1) essentislly equwnolar complexes of C8-C18 alkyl ethoxy carboxysc acids and C8 C18 ethoxy dimethyl amnes; (2) stfcones soluble in the aqueous detergent mixture herein selected from the group consisting of porydimethylsiloxane polyether copolymers, poiydimethyteilaxanes containing an arwno substftutuent and mixtures thereof; and (3) a mature of (1) sno7or (2) with a quatemized ceUutosic polymer or a mixtures of quaterruzed ceHuiosc polymer with rrsnor proportions of non-ceiluiosic quaternary conditioning polymers.<br>
The equunotar complexes of C8-C18 alky ethoxy carboxylic acids and C8-C18 alkyl etnoxy dimethyl amines are believed to form amine salts which provide conditioning properties in the described composrtions. Usually, the ethoxytated carboxylic acid will contain from 1 to 10 ethoxyl groups and preferably from 2 to 6 ethoxy groups   On the other hand, the higher alkyl dimethyl amine may contain from 0 to 10 ethoxy groups   While the amine salts are believed to form when equimolar amounts of said carboxylic acid and said dimethyl amine are present, the presence of excess dimethylamme on a molar basis does not have an adverse effect on the conditioning properties of the amine salt and a slight molar excess of said amine may be preferred   Preferred carboxylic acids are the<br>
C10-C14 (ElO)2-6 carboxylic aads and preferred amines are the C14-C18 alky I and C14-C18 alkyl<br>
amido propyl dimethyl amines.<br>
Generally the proportion of the amine salt formed by the complex of C8-C18 alkyl ethoxy<br>
carboxylic acid and the C8-C18 aikyi dimethyl amine will be about 0 05% to 5%, preferably 0.1% to<br>
2.5%, and most preferably about 0 15% to 1 5%. by weight of the resultant composition. When this<br>
complex is used as sole conditioner, a low level of conditioning is perceived by the user.<br>
Surfactant-Soluble. Water-Insoluble Silicones or Silicone-Oenvatives<br>
The silicones or silicone-denvatrves that are useful in the present invention are those that are soluble in and compatible with the above described aqueous detersive surfactant mixture, but are insoluble in water. This allows them to be formulated into detergent compositions that are initially transparent, but which, if desired, can be opacified or pea/iized by adding recognized peartong/opacrfying ingredients such as ethylene glycol dtstearate or polystyrene. Suitable silicones mdude trtnethyisiytamoofrrtetriicone purchased under the trad* name Dow Corning G2-8220 - an amine functional corydirnethytsdoxane; copolymers of polydirnethylsiloxane and a poly C2-C3 alkytane ether purchased under the tradenames Dow Coming 190, Dow Corning 2*5324 and Dow Corning Q2-5220; and pofydimethyl siioxanes having at least one quaternary ammonium moiety, preferably two quaternary ammonium moieties. The latter siBcone 8 available cornrneraaUy under the tradename A8IL-QUAT 3270 for example. If silicones other than those above are employed, the resultant compositions usually are not dear because part of the pofydimethyisdoxane a present in water insoluble form.<br>
The proportion of the surfactant soluble, water insoluble silicone in the inventive composition broadly win be in the range of about 0.25% to about 3%, preferably 0.5% to 2%, most preferably 0.7% to 1.5%, by weight. When said silicone is the sole conditioning agent present, a composition having a low conditioning effect is achieved - a conditioning value of 2.5 for example. However, when a mixture of the described amine salt, cellulose pofyquat and the described silicone is employed as the conditioning agent, the resultant composition exhibits high conditioning properties -- a value of 7.0 or more in the applicable test<br>
Cationic Polymers The water-insoluble conditioning complex of carboxylic acid and amine and the water insolubl*. silicone conditioning agents are soluble in the described aqueous detergent mature, but are rendered water-insoluble when the resultant detergent compositions are diluted with water dunng use. In addition, either one or both of these conditioning agents may be further employed in admixture with a cationic cellulose polymer. Because the canonic cellulose polymers are water soluble and soluble in the aqueous detergent mixture, clear detergent mixtures can be prepared when the caitonic ceUulosic polymers are employed as the sole conditioning agent.<br>
The suitable hair conditioning, cationic polymers are derivatives of natural polymers such as cellulose and gums. These derivatives generally are water-soluble to the extent of at least 0.5% by weight at 20°C. Generally, such polymers have more than 10 monomer units in the* molecules and a molecular weight of about 1000 to about 1,000.000, preferably 2000 to 500.000. Usually, the tower the molecular weight, the higher the degree of substitution by the cationic, usuaJJy quaternary, group.<br>
Suitable natural polymers which may be converted into the deeired cationic polymers are<br>
hydroxy alkyl celluoses and alkyl hydroxy celluloses.	Cationic hydroxy alkyl celluloses and ther<br>
preparation are described in B.P. No. 1,166.062 assigned to Union Carbide. These hydroxy ethyl celluloses are marketed under the trade designation JR 125, JR30M and JR 400 and ere believed to have a molecular weight of 150,00 to 400,000 and a degree of substitution of a quaternary group of about 0.3.   Akyl hydroxy alky! celluloses having the same formula as hydroxy alkyt cellulose, but w*h additional alkyl substituents at other sites on the anhydroglucose unit also are avaiable. More particularly, the ethyl hydroxy ethyl celluloses are available under the tradename 'ModocolP with a molecular weight in the range of about 50,000 to 500,000 and a degree of substitution of about 0.1 to 0.8.<br>
Other suitable natural cationic polymers are the galactomannan gums, e.g., guar gum and hydroxy alkylated guar gum   The molecular weight of guar gum is believed to be from about 100,000 to 1,000,000   A suitable cationic guar gum carrying the group -CH2CH=CH CH2N (CH3)3C&gt;* with a degree of substitution of about 0 2 to 0 8 is commercially available under the tradenames Jaguar C-17<br>
and C-13.   The preferred cationic cellulose polymer is Poryquatemium 10 which is a polymeric quaternary ammonium sai! of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted wrth a trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide.<br>
The proportion of the cationic natural polymer usually will be from about 0 05% to about 1%, preferably 0.1% to 0.8%, most preferably from 0 2% to 0.7%, by weight of the finai composrtion. The cationic polymer provides for enhanced style control and conditioning. When Poryquatemium 10 is employed as the sole conditioning agent, a product wrth moderate conditioning results.<br>
When the cationic natural cellulose or gaiactomannan gum polymers are present in the inventive compositions, up to about one half the weight of said natural polymer may be substituted by a second non-catluiosic, cationic polymer, having conditioning properties provided that the non-ceUulosic cationic polymer is soluble in the final composition. Exemplary of such cationic polymers are dtaJkyidlafyl ammonium salt (e.g., halide) homoporymers or copolymers, e.g., dimethyidiaUyl ammonium chloride homoporyrner, dimethyidiaJyl ammonium chlonde/acrylamide copolymer containing at least 60%  ammonium chloride monomer, dirnethyidiairyl ammonium chlonde/acryiic aad copolymer containing at least 90% dimethyidiaJfyl arnrnonium chloride monomer, vinyl jnrtazde/vinyi pyrrotidone copolymers containing at least 50% vinyl imidazole and potyethyieneimine. Currently, the preferred cationic polymers are Merquat 100 [a polymer of diaillyldimethyl ammonium chlonde (charge density of 126)) and Luviquat 905 [a 95% vinyl imidazole/5% vinylpyrrolidone copolymer (charge density of 116)J. Other suitable non-ceilulosic cationic polymers are disclosed m the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary under the designation •Polyquatemium* followed by a whole number.<br>
OptionaJry. the inventive compositions may include, in addition, a controlled amount of rnono-C14-C18 alkyl quaternary ammonium salt or di-Ci2*Ci8 alkyl (EtO) dimethyl ammonium salt to provide enhanced anti static effect. The mono alkyl quaternary salts have the following formula.<br>
R9.R10,R11, R12 N+X-wherein at least three of the R groups are C1-C4 alkyl and at least one is a C10-C22 alkyl, with X being a salt-forming anion, such as chlonde, bromide, methosulfate or ethosulfate. Preferably, the lower alkyl groups will contain one to two carbons, the higher alkyl group will contain 14-18 carbon atoms and the<br>
water-so/ubilizing group will be chlorine or bromine. Suitable compounds include cetyf trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride and stearyi trimethyl ammonium chlonde. Alternatively a di (C14-C18) alkyl<br>
(EtO)3-20 dimethyl ammonium salt may be employed wherein from 3 to 20 ethoxy groups are present<br>
with alkyl substitute   Preferred compounds are di-stearyl (EtO)5 dimethyl ammonium chlonde and di-<br>
stearyl (ElO)is dimethyl ammonium chlonde. If ethoxylated alkyl groups are not present in the di-higher<br>
alkyl quaternary salt, the resultant compositions are not clear for example.<br>
Generally the proportion of added mono C14-C18 alkyl quaternary sail or di C12-C18 alkyl<br>
(EtO)3-20 quaternary salt will be from about 0.05% to about 1%, preferabry from 0.1% to 0.5%, and<br>
most preferably   15% to   0.35%, by weight. The anti static effects increase as the proportion of said<br>
added quaternary salt increases.<br>
The final essential component in the inventive compositions is water which provides an<br>
aqueous medium. Generally, the proportion of water wifl range from about 51 % to about 95%,<br>
preferably, about 61% to about 92%, and most preferabry about 70% to about 88%, by weight of the<br>
resultant composition.<br>
An important characteristic of the inventive compositions is that the turn at the moles of anionic<br>
detergent and the moles of anionic hydrotrope is substantially equal to the sum of the moles of<br>
amphoteric detergent and the moles of cationc conditioning compound including, optionally, the<br>
moles at mono alkyl or dialkylethoxy quaternary ano static compound. On a molar basis the ratio of<br>
anionic compounds to amphoteric compounds plus cationic compounds wifl be the range of about<br>
0.8:1 to about 1.25:1, preferabry about 0.9:1 to about 1.10:1, most preferably about 0.95:1 to about<br>
1.05:1. It appears that the proportions of afl of the essential ingredients are interrelated and must be<br>
controlled in order to achieve compositions having the desired mildness, foaming, cleaning,<br>
conditioning, clarity and viscosity characteristics   Generally, the viscosity of the inventive compositions<br>
will be in the range of about 1000 to 10,000 cps, preferably 2000 to 7000 cps, and most preferably<br>
3500 cps to 5500 cps, at 24°C , as measured with a Brookfield RVT viscometer using a #4 spindle<br>
rotating at 20 rpm<br>
 These inventive compositions are essentially unbuilt liquids, i e , do not contain detergent<br>
building proportions of water-soluble inorganic or organic builder ingredients   Therefore, the resultant<br>
compositions are suitable for use as liquid hand washing detergents, liquid shampoos, liquid shower<br>
bath products and light duty fabric washing products   Thus, these inventive compositions can contain<br>
any of the usual adjuvants found in those compositions provided that they do not interfere with the<br>
mildness, performance or clarity characteristics descnbed in the final products. Such additional<br>
ingredients include minor proportions of perfumes and cotonng ingredients for aesthetic purposes;<br>
opactfiers such as ethylene glycol distearate or polystyrene, sequestering agents such as citrate or<br>
ethytenediamine tetreaacetate; preservatives such as formaldehyde or Kathon CG® or<br>
monomethyloldimethyl hydantoin; fluorescent agents, acids or bases for adjusting pH; and inert salts<br>
such as sodium sulfate. The total concentration of added ingredients usually will be less than 5%,<br>
preferably less than 3%, by weight of the total composition.<br>
The nventfve compositions are prepared by admixing the cafjonic polymer, if any, with water at<br>
a temperature tn the range of about 20°C. to 60°C., usmg sufficient agitation unti a dear,<br>
homogeneous mixture is formed. Thereafter, the anionic surfactants, namely, the anionic detergent<br>
compound and the anionic hydrotroptc agent are added while continuing the agitation until a<br>
homogeneous mixture is formed. Thereafter, the amphoteric detergent and the silicone ingredient, i<br>
any, are added w*h agitation to the aqueous mature of catiaiic poiyrner ajid amonic surfactants and<br>
agitation is continued unti the resultant mixture m homogeneous. Next the diaodium phosphate is<br>
added to adjust the pH to 6.0 - 6.5. Next, t the carboxyic aod arrune salt is present, a premix of the<br>
ca/boxyiic aod and the desred amine is prepared with agitation at a temperature m the range 20°C. to<br>
60°C. Optionally, the perfume is included in this premix which is mixed until homogeneity is achieved.<br>
Thereafter, the prema is added to the aqueous detergent mature with agitation which continues unta<br>
homogeneity is achieved. Fmalty the formula amounts of quaternary salt anti-stat, if any, preservative, if<br>
any, and color, if any, are added with agitation   During the manufactunng process, mixing is controlled<br>
to avoid foaming. The resultant composition is clear and has a pH in the range of about 5 5 to 7 0,<br>
preferably from about 6.0 to 6 5<br>
In the preferred process, the composition is prepared without the addition of external heat.<br>
Thur. the process temperature is controlled in the range of 20°C   to 30°C.  Using this so-called "cold<br>
process' saves energy and the time required to raise or lower the temperature.<br>
Normally, the viscosity and pH of the resultant product is checked before the product is filled<br>
into containers for saie. If necessary, additional anionic hydrotrope is added to decrease viscosity or<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 18-propylene glycol oleale is added to increase viscosity. Also, if necessary,<br>
disodium phosphate dibasic or crtnc acid or other acid or base is added to adjust the pH. Preferably, the<br>
resultant composition is passed through a 20 mesh or equivalent filter prior to filling same into<br>
containers for saie.<br>
The foaming properties of the inventive compositions are determined by diluting 15CC of the<br>
resultant composition with 85cc of 250 pom water (40% Mg"*-1", 60% Ca++), adding 3.0 grams of sebum<br>
sod and adjusting the temperature to 25°C. with agitation. Thereafter, the solution is added to a 500 ml<br>
graduated cylinder containing a plastic tube fffled with water which has a volume of 25cc The 500 ml<br>
glass stoppered cylinder is then rotated through 40 half circles at a speed of 30 rpm. After removing<br>
the stepper, trie foam volume is read. The cylinder then is removed from the rotation apparatus and<br>
placed on a table top. The time interval in seconds is recorded from the completion of rotation until the<br>
liquid level in the cylinder reaches 100 ml (75% of the liquid has drained) and the results are recorded<br>
as ml of foam/drainage time in seconds. Ml of Foam and drainage tines are then expressed on a scale<br>
of 1 to 10 - 1 poorest 10 best -<br>
The conditioning properties are determined by combing hair tresses treated with the product<br>
using the fine teeth of the comb when wet and after drying. In this evaluation 3.2 gm tresses of virgin,<br>
European brown hair obtained from DeMeo Brothers, Inc. are prepared with the root end of the hair at<br>
the top of the tress. The tresses are nnsed with running tap water at 105°F (40.5°C.) and then 1 cc of<br>
the test product is worked into the tress with the fingers for one minute   The treated tress is rinsed for<br>
30 seconds and a second application of test product is worked into the tress for one minute followed by<br>
a 30 second nnsmg. Then each tress is nnsed for 60 seconds with 105°F running tap water and<br>
detangled by combing with the wide teeth of the comb   The wetted tresses are maintained wet with<br>
deionized water and are combed by expert judges using the fine teeth of the comb. The |udges assign<br>
a rating of 1 to 10 for each tress, with 10 being easiest to comb. Each tress is combed by a minimum of<br>
10 judges and the ratings are averaged   In the described procedure, the hair tresses are evaluated<br>
while wet. The procedure for dry combing is identical except that the hair tresses are dned before<br>
being combed.<br>
In the test for evaluation of static, the hair tresses are treated with product as described above and dried. The dned tress is then combed by a stalled evaJuator in a forceful, downward manner 20 times usw&gt;g the fine teeth of the comb. The static on each is then evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being excellent. Again, each tress is combed by 10 |udges and the ratings are averaged. This evaluation is earned out in a constant temperature - constant humidity room.<br>

These examples illustrate that the amine-acid complexes - amine salts - provide conditioning propertiee and that the conditioning properties increase as the proportion of the amine-acid complex - amine sal - increases. However, even at the highest concentration of the amine salt, i.e., 4% by weight because excess amine is present, the conditioning rating is 3.5 which is low. Further, as the level of ethoxylation increases in the carboxylic acid component, the conditioning value decreases because the motor amount of the amine salt produced therefrom decreases.<br>
When stearamidopropyl dimethyl amine is substituted for isosteararnidopropyl dimethyl amine in Examples 9-12. the conditioning properties and foaming properties of the final compositions are not changed.<br>

Example 28 illustrates that foaming is reduced when a proportion of 8% by weight of the<br>
detersive surfactant is employed.  Further, as expected, good foaming is achieved when the proportion<br>
of detersive surfactant is increased to 24 2% by weight of the composition.<br>

Example 30 differs from Example 29 in that the molecular proportion of anionic detergent a increased<br>
to be equivalent to the sum of the molar proportion of anionic detergent and anionic hydrotropic<br>
sulfonate shown in the control formulation of Example 19.<br>
Comparison of Examples 27 and 28 compositions with the Example 19 composition illustrates that omission of the anionic hydrotrope ingredient from the inventive compositions results in a significant reduction in foaming and a doubling in viscosity. In these examples, the applicable molar ratios of anionic compounds to amphoteric plus cationic compounds are 0.78:1 and 1.03:1 respectively. Thus, the presence of the anionic hydrotrope sulfonate/sulfate ingredient is essential in the claimed detersive surfactant mixture of the inventive compositions.<br>
When like molar proportions of cocyl isethionate anionic detergent, hydrotropic sodium xylene sulfonate, hydrotropic hexyl sulfate, lauryl trimethyl betaine, sodium cocoyl amphopnonate and<br>
lauryiamidoethyl suttaine are substituted for the corresponding components in the above examples,<br>
compositions having similar performance and physical characteristics are obtained. The resultant<br>
products are effective for conditioning hair and skin and, therefore, are useful for cleansing the hair and<br>
skin.<br>
Although the need for substantially balanced molar proportions of anionic materials - detergent<br>
plus hydrotropic sulfonate/sulfate - and amphoteric plus cationic ingredients is not understood, it is<br>
believed that the anionic ingredients and the amphoteric plus cationic materials form a complex -<br>
possibly two complexes. The existence of at least one complex is suggested by the improved<br>
mildness and the increased viscosity of the resultant mixtures. It is further suggested by the improved<br>
conditioning properties when conditioning agents are included. While the actual mechanism is not<br>
understood, the efficacy of the resultant compositions is apparent at use concentrations thereof.<br>
The dear ultra mild compositions of the present invention can also be formulated as anti-<br>
dendruff shampoos, by employing therein about 0.10% to about 4% by weight of a conventional<br>
anti-dandruff therapeutic agent which is soluble n the detersive surfactant mixture. Such agents<br>
include: 1-imidazolyl-chiorophenoxy)-3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one	(Ctimbazole); acetytealicytic<br>
acid; salicylic acid; 2,4,4,,-tnchloro-2'-hydroxy diphenyi ether (tnclosan); 1-acetyl-4-(4-{(2-(2.4-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-2-{1 H-imidazoly-l ,3-dioxolanl)methoxy)phenyl)-paperazina<br>
(ketoconazoie); 1-hydroxy-4-methyl-6,4,4-trimethylpentyl)-2-pyridone monoethonolamine salt<br>
(picrotone otamine); and mixtures thereof. Climbazole is the preferred anti-dandruff therapeutic<br>
agent.<br>
