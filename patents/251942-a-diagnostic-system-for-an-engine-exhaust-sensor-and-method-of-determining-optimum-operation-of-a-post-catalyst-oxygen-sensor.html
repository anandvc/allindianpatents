FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention relates to diagnostic systems for<br>
vehicles, and more particularly to a post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 During the combustion process, gasoline is oxidized and<br>
hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) combine with air. Various chemical compounds<br>
are formed including carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), carbon monoxide<br>
(CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur oxides<br>
(SOx), and other compounds.<br>
 Automobile exhaust systems include a catalytic converter<br>
that reduces exhaust emissions by chemically converting the exhaust gas into<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N), and water (H2O). Exhaust gas oxygen<br>
sensors generate signals indicating the oxygen content of the exhaust gas.<br>
An inlet or pre-catalyst oxygen sensor monitors the oxygen level associated<br>
with an inlet exhaust stream of the catalytic converter. This inlet O2 sensor is<br>
also the primary feedback mechanism that maintains the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio<br>
of the engine at the chemically correct or stoichiometric A/F ratio that is<br>
needed to support the catalytic conversion processes. An outlet or post-<br>
catalyst oxygen sensor monitors the oxygen level associated with an outlet<br>
exhaust stream of the catalytic converter. The post-02 sensor signal is used<br>
for secondary A/F ratio control. <br><br>
 System diagnostics require properly functioning oxygen<br>
sensors. Therefore, the oxygen sensors are periodically checked to ensure<br>
proper function. Traditionally, diagnostics employ intrusive checks to check<br>
the operation of the sensors. During the intrusive checks, the A/F ratio is<br>
manipulated and the sensor response is monitored. However, these intrusive<br>
checks may increase exhaust emissions and/or cause engine instability and<br>
reduced driveability that may be noticeable by a vehicle operator. Further,<br>
traditional diagnostics are more complex and computationally intense than<br>
desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Accordingly, the present invention provides an engine<br>
exhaust sensor diagnostic system for an exhaust system including a catalyst<br>
and a post-catalyst oxygen sensor. The engine exhaust sensor diagnostic<br>
system includes a first module that calculates a total integrated area based on<br>
a signal generated by the post-catalyst oxygen sensor. A second module<br>
compares the total integrated area to a threshold integrated area and<br>
generates a pass status signal when the total integrated area is less than the<br>
threshold integrated area.<br>
 In another feature, the second module generates a fail status<br>
signal when the total integrated area is not less than the threshold integrated<br>
area.<br>
 In other features, the engine exhaust sensor diagnostic<br>
system further includes a third module that normalizes the total integrated<br>
area. The total integrated area is normalized based on an average flow rate<br>
of exhaust gas. Alternatively, the total integrated area is normalized based on<br>
a switching rate of a pre-catalyst oxygen sensor.<br><br>
 In still other features, the first module discounts an integrated<br>
area that is associated with a signal reversal from the total integrated area.<br>
Accordingly, the engine exhaust sensor diagnostic system further includes a<br>
third module that monitors the signal and that indicates the signal reversal<br>
when the signal exceeds a continuously updated minimum signal value during<br>
a rich to lean transition. Alternatively, the engine exhaust sensor diagnostic<br>
system of further includes a third module that monitors the signal and that<br>
indicates the signal reversal when the signal falls below a continuously<br>
updated maximum signal value during a lean to rich transition.<br>
 Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12, an exhaust system 14 and a control module 16. Air is drawn into<br>
the engine 12 through a throttle 17 and an intake manifold 18, and is mixed<br>
with fuel inside the engine 12. The air and fuel mixture is combusted within<br>
cylinders (not shown) to generate drive torque. The gases produced via<br>
combustion exit the engine through an exhaust manifold 19 and the exhaust<br>
system 14. The exhaust system 14 includes a catalytic converter 22, a pre-<br>
catalyst or inlet oxygen sensor 24, hereinafter pre-02 sensor 24 and a post-<br>
catalyst oxygen sensor 26, herein after post-02 sensor 26. The exhaust<br>
gases are treated within the catalytic converter 22 and are exhausted to<br>
atmosphere.<br>
 The pre-02 sensor 24 and the post-02 sensor 26 generate<br>
respective voltage signals that are communicated to the control module 16.<br>
The pre-02 and post-02 sensor signals indicate the oxygen content of the<br>
exhaust entering and exiting the catalytic converter 22, respectively. The<br><br>
control module 16 communicates with a fuel system (not shown) to regulate<br>
fuel flow to the engine 12 based on the sensor signals.<br>
 Referring now to Figures 2, the post-02 sensor 26 is typically<br>
a narrow range "switching" sensor. The voltage output signal is generated by<br>
the sensor based on the oxygen content of the exhaust gases passing<br>
thereby. As best seen in Figure 2, an oxygen sensor signal generated by a<br>
healthy or operating sensor varies based on the oxygen content of the<br>
exhaust gas. The most common characteristic of a malfunctioning oxygen<br>
sensor is a lazy or sluggish response. For example, with a malfunctioning<br>
oxygen sensor, an increased amount of time is required for the signal to<br>
transition from rich to lean and/or lean to rich.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, the post-catalyst oxygen sensor<br>
diagnostic of the present invention monitors the performance of the post-02<br>
sensor 26 by calculating an integrated area (IA) above or below the sensor's<br>
voltage signal (VpO2) during a transition from rich to lean and/or lean to rich.<br>
As the signal transition speed decreases, the IA increases. The IA is<br>
compared to a threshold IA (IATHR) to determine whether the signal has so<br>
deteriorated that the post-02 sensor 26 should be serviced or replaced.<br>
 The post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic is preferably<br>
executed during a non-intrusive action. For example, the diagnostic can be<br>
executed during a deceleration fuel cut-off (DFCO) maneuver, during which<br>
the signal transitions from rich to lean as a result of fuel cut-off to the cylinders<br>
during vehicle deceleration. The diagnostic can similarly be executed during<br>
a non-intrusive maneuver, during which the signal transitions from lean to rich.<br>
It is also anticipated, however, that the diagnostic can be executed by<br>
intrusively commanding lean to rich or rich to lean transitions as desired.<br>
 The IA is calculated between first and second voltages V1,<br>
V2, respectively, and the times t1, t2, at which the signal achieves the<br>
respective voltages. V1 and V2 are selected based on preliminary data<br>
analysis of the lean (e.g., during DFCO) and rich transitions for a plurality of<br><br>
combinations of the post-catalyst oxygen sensor and catalytic converter<br>
states. For example, the preliminary data includes data collected using a<br>
good (i.e., appropriately functioning) post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined<br>
with a good catalyst, a good post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined with a bad<br>
catalyst (i.e., not appropriately functioning), a bad post-catalyst oxygen sensor<br>
combined with a bad catalyst, and a bad post-catalyst oxygen sensor<br>
combined with a good catalyst. The voltages that are the most sensitive to<br>
failure of the post-catalyst oxygen sensor and at the same time is the least<br>
sensitive to the catalytic converter state are selected. The voltages are<br>
selected separately for the rich to lean and for the lean to rich transitions.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 4, the post-catalyst oxygen sensor<br>
implements a reverse freezing routine to filter out bad data during signal<br>
transition. In some instances, the signal can temporarily reverse during the<br>
transition. For example, in the case of a rich to lean transition, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 4, the signal can temporarily increase or spike in a direction opposite to<br>
the direction of the transition. More specifically, because the signal is<br>
decreasing during this transition, a minimum voltage (VMIN) is continuously<br>
updated. If the signal reverses (i.e., is greater than VMIN), reversing has<br>
occurred. Accordingly, the post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic ignores the<br>
area underneath the signal during the time that the signal is reversed (tREv)-<br>
The IA is calculated as the sum of the usable or valid integrated areas (e.g.,<br>
IAX and IAy). In the case of a lean to rich transition, the signal increases<br>
during transition. Therefore, in this case, a maximum voltage (VMAX) is<br>
continuously updated and reversing occurs if the signal falls below VMAX-<br>
 The post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic also implements<br>
a normalization routine of the integral parameters. More specifically, a<br>
normalized IA (IANORM) is calculated, which is compared to IAJHR. In one<br>
feature, IA is normalized based on the average exhaust flow at the beginning<br>
of the rich to lean and lean to rich transition to reduce variation of IA due to<br><br>
the average exhaust flow changes at the beginning of the transition. The<br>
following formula is used for the average exhaust flow based normalization:<br>
IANORM = (IA)(EAVG)<br>
where EAVG is the average exhaust flow. The coefficient T is a calibration<br>
value that is determined based on a least squared statistical method, which is<br>
supported using an automated tool that allows multiple non-normalized data<br>
input and normalized output for the coefficient. A different value of T is<br>
provided based on whether the transition is rich to lean or lean to rich. In<br>
another feature, IA is normalized based on the switch rate of the pre-02<br>
sensor 24 (e.g., between 600 and 300 mV) during the rich to lean and the<br>
lean to rich transitions. The following formula is used for the average exhaust<br>
flow based normalization:<br>
IANORM = (IA)(SR)T<br>
where SR is the switch rate of the pre-02 sensor 24 and the coefficient T is a<br>
calibration value that is determined in similar manner as described above.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 5, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic of the present invention will be<br>
described. In step 500, control determines whether to enable the post-<br>
catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic. For example, if a non-intrusive fuel<br>
transition is to occur (e.g., DFCO), the diagnostic is enabled. It is<br>
appreciated, however, that the diagnostic can be enabled any time deemed<br>
appropriate and can be enabled using an intrusive fuel transition. If the<br>
diagnostic is not enabled, control loops back. If the diagnostic is enabled,<br>
control determines whether the fuel transition is from rich to lean in step 502.<br>
If the transition is a rich to lean transition, control continues in step 504. If the<br>
transition is not a rich to lean transition, control continues in step 506.<br><br>
 In step 504, control monitors VP02- Control updates VMIN in<br>
step 508. In step 510, control determines whether VMIN exceeds VP02- If VMIN<br>
exceeds VP02, a signal reversal has occurred and the area beneath VP02<br>
during this time should not be considered. Accordingly, control updates tREv in<br>
step 512 and loops back to step 504. If VMIN does not exceed VP02, control<br>
determines whether VP02 is equal to V2 in step 514. If VPo2 is not equal to V2,<br>
control loops back to step 504. If VP02 is equal to V2, control continues in step<br>
516.<br>
 In step 506, control monitors VP02- Control updates VMAx in<br>
step 518. In step 520, control determines whether VMAX is less than VP02- If<br>
VMAX is less than VP02, a signal reversal has occurred and the area beneath<br>
Vpo2 during this time should not be considered. Accordingly, control updates<br>
tREv in step 522 and loops back to step 506. If VMAX is not less than VPo2,<br>
control determines whether VP02 is equal to Vi in step 524. If VP02 is not<br>
equal to V-i, control loops back to step 506. If VP02 is equal to V-i, control<br>
continues in step 516.<br>
 In step 516, control determines IANORM- Control determines<br>
whether IANORM is less than IATHR in step 526. If IANORM is less than IATHR,<br>
control indicates a PASS status for the post-02 sensor 26 in step 528 and<br>
control ends. If IANORM is not less than IATHR, control indicates a FAIL status<br>
for the post-02 sensor 26 in step 530 and control ends.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 6, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the post-catalyst oxygen sensor diagnostic of the present invention will be<br>
described. The exemplary modules include a reverse freezing module 600,<br>
an IA calculating module 602, an IA normalizing module 604 and a<br>
comparator module 606. The reverse freezing module 600 monitors VP02 and<br>
forwards VP02 values to the IA calculating module 602. More specifically, the<br>
reverse freezing module 600 filters out any VP02 values that correspond to a<br>
reversal period (tREv).<br><br>
 The IA calculating module 602 calculates IA based on the<br>
Vp02 values forwarded by the reverse freezing module 600. The IA<br>
normalizing module 604 determines IANORM based on IA. More specifically,<br>
the IA normalizing module 604 normalizes IA based on T, which is selected<br>
from pre-stored values based on the type of transition, and EAVG and/or SR.<br>
The comparator module 606 compares IANORM and IATHR and generates a<br>
PASS or a FAIL signal based thereon. More specifically, if IANORM is less than<br>
IATHR, the comparator module 606 generates a PASS signal, and if IANORM is<br>
not less than IATHR, the comparator module 606 generates a FAIL signal.<br>

implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
