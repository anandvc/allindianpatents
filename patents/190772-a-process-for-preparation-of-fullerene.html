				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
this   invention   relates  to   a   process   for preparation  of ful lerene  containing 50 and  60  carbon atoms from sugars. PRIOR ART<br>
It is generally known that Carbon—60 material  has<br>
several  applications, and particularly in the  instance where high strength and impact properties arp  required.<br>
It  is  considered  that the strength  of  Carbon 60  is greater than metals such as, iron.<br>
The known process for preparation of  a  fullerena structure  containing  60  carbon  atoms   consisted  in<br>
subjecting  graphite   to  high  temperatures  at about 4500'C  such  as  by  electric arc,  so  as  In  form  a<br>
fullerene structure containing 60 carbon atoms.   Though not  certain, it is generally believed that when  carbon<br>
atoms  present  in graphite are  caused to he in  a high energy state by heating at a temperature of the order of<br>
4000'C and 4500'C, such carbon atoms present in graphite<br>
form into a fullerene structure containing 60 carbon atoms. A distinct disadvantage of such a known process is that of use of high temperature, which contributes to the cost far tor of the end product.<br>
Yet a further disadvantage is that of processing costs. The yield from graphite is approximately about 10% however, irrespective of such a high yield,  the<br>
processing costs are substantial due to the high costs of the raw material. A further disadvantage of surh a process is of the high energy requirements, which conrtibute to the end costs of the process.<br>
Yet  another process known in the art consists  in burning  mineral  oil  to  form  soot,  which  is   then dissolved in benzene to provide fullerene containing  60 carbon atoms.  A disadvantage of such a process is  that of low yield and high impurity.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel process  for  the preparation of a  fullerene  structure<br>
containing 60 carbon atoms.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process fnr the preparation of a fullerene structure rontaininq 60 carbon atoms from sucrose.<br>
Yet. another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a fullerene structure containing 60 carbon atoms from sucrose which is more economical.<br>
ft further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a fullerene structure containing 68) carbon and u.56) carbon atoms from surrow.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a fiillprpne strucutre containing 60 carbon atoms from sucrose which is efficient.<br>
Yet a further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a fullerene structure i.ontaining 60 carbon atoms and 50 car lion atoms which no longer employs high temperatures as high as that of graphite.<br>
DESCRTPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this there is provided a process for the preparation of fullerene structure having 60 carbon atom from sucrose comprising heating sucrose at a temperature higher than the caramelization temperature but less than 500°C for a period of 4 to 8 hours in an inert atmosphere so as to cause a dehydration and allowing the carbon atoms to be in a high energy state for formation of a charred material, subjecting the charred material to the step of extraction for obtaining a fullerene structure containing 60 carbon atoms.<br>
In accordance with this invention, sucrose is heated at a temperature of below 500°C, but above the temperature required for formation of caramel. The step of heating sucrose to a temperature of approximately 200°C to form caramel is known as such in the art. However, the caramel formed by such a method contained carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and which presence was necessary as caramel is normally used as a food additive.<br>
In distinction to the step of forming r.nr amel , the present invention envisages the use of temper a Lures higher than that known in the step of caramplization. Thus, and as by way of example, the present invention envisages a preferable temperature of substantially above 200'C, so as to cause dehydration of sucrose, but below 500'C.<br>
The theory present in the formation of fullerene containing 60 carbon atoms by the process of the present invention has still not been ascertained. Thus, the theory described hereinafter is not to be construed in a limited or restrictive manner. It is believed that when sucrose is heated to a temperature of below 500'C, sucrose is subjected to a step of dehydration and, further, nascent twelve carbon frame is converted into a high energy state resulting in a cluster of 60 rarbon atoms. It has been surpr isingly found that fullerene with 60 carbon atoms is formed by employing temperatures above 200'C but below 500'C. In a likewise manner, it has still not been ascertained as to why lower temperatures in comparison to those employed for heating<br>
of graphite successfully provides the product. It is belived, though not certain, that the presence of water in sucrose may be a contributing factor for obtaining the product at lower temperatures.<br>
As described hereinabove, sucrose is heated to a temperature below 500'C and preferably at a temperature of approximately 350'C to 400'C for formation of fullerene having &amp;0 carbon atoms. Such a heating is prefer ably carried out for a period of four to eight hours. Such a heating temperature and period of heating does provide the required product, though it is generally believed that the said product can he obtained also at. a shorter period and higher temperature of heatinq.<br>
The step of heating is carried out in art inert atmosphere such as argon so as to avoid the formation of side r earctions .<br>
The process of the present invention provides fullerene having 60 carbon atoms and new fullerene having   50  carbon  atoms.   Further  carbon   clusters<br>
containing 120-130 carbon atoms comprising C 60 as basic<br>
unit.<br>
Further  objects  and advantages  of  the  present<br>
invention  will  be  more  apparent  from  the   ensuing<br>
example. However, it is to be understood that th« ensuing  example is not to be construed as a  limitation<br>
on the teachings of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Sucrose weighing 2 gm was heated in an electric furnace at about 350'C for about eight hours in a ceramic boat in an inert atmosphare of orqon, (The furnace temperature was controlled with the help of variac whose temperature was monitored by thermocouple). The soot so formed from sucrose was collected. The collector soot was soxilated with benzene. After soxilation for eight hours, benzene formed into pale yellow solution. The same experiment was repeated five times. Soot obtained in each experiment was soxilated with benzene. The pale benzene solution was stored in a volumetric  flast  and  concentrates  for  testing,  mass<br>
spectrometric analysis of pale benzene solution confirmed the presence of fullerene. Fullerene prepared from 10 gm sucrose was concentrated in a rotatory evapor tor . The material thus obtained weighed of 0.108 gm. Repeating several experiments weight of fullerene varied  from 0.1 to 0.15 gm.<br><br><br><br><br>
1 CLAIM<br>
1 A process for the preparation of fullerene structure having 60 carbon atom from sucrose comprising heating sucrose at a temperature higher than the caramelization temperature but less than 500°C for a period of 4 to 8 hours in an inert atmosphere so as to cause a dehydration and allowing the carbon atoms to be in a high energy state for formation of a charred material, subjecting the charred material to the step of extraction for obtaining a fullerene structure containing 60 carbon atoms<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said sucrose/sugar is heated to a temperature of between 200 to 500°C<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein said sucrose/sugar is preferably heated at a temperature of 350 to 400°C.<br>
4.	A process for the preparation of fullerene structure having 60 carbon atom from sucrose substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
