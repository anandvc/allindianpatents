				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for extruding flowable substances comprising a rotating<br>
cylindrical drum provided with apertures over the entire circumference, a feed device for<br>
the substance fixedly arranged inside the drum, and a nozzle strip with a flow channel<br>
connected to said feed device and arranged at the lower region of the inner circumference<br>
of the drum through which the substances are fed uniformly across the axial length of the<br>
drum to the apertures where the substances are forced out from said apertures in the<br>
shape of droplets, which fall on a conveyor and/or cooling belt moving under the drum<br>
and solidify thereon.<br>
A device of this type is disclosed in EP 0 145 839 A2 wherein the perforated drum moves<br>
around the circumference of an inner cylinder, which is provided with a feed channel that<br>
is axially fed from the front, a separating chamber extending parallel to said feed channel,<br>
and a nozzle strip inserted into a groove at the outer circumference of said cylinder. Said<br>
nozzle strip is provided with a plurality of borings arranged axially at a distance to one<br>
another whereby said borings are connected to a continuous groove forming an exit<br>
chamber in the nozzle strip which abuts the inner circumference of the rotating perforated<br>
drum.<br>
Devices of this type have shown to be extremely advantageous for granulating certain<br>
substances. However, the production capacity of such devices is limited since the speed<br>
of such rotating drums cannot be increased at will because of the developing centrifugal<br>
forces whereby the drums have normally a diameter in the range of 80 mm.<br>
It has also been shown that the interior, especially the area of the nozzle strip, has a<br>
tendency to clog in the region of its through-boring, particularly during granulating of<br>
products depositing sediments, such as suspensions, and that residues are formed<br>
therefore which can negatively influence the production process and whereby said<br>
residues would have to be removed at regular intervals. Arbitrary enlargement of the<br>
apertures would in turn lead to uncontrolled extrusion of the substances with the result<br>
that the desired droplet shaping cannot be achieved at the point of exit above the cooling<br>
belt.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object to search for a solution through<br>
which the flow rate of the substance to be extruded can be respectively adjusted to the<br>
desired amount of throughput without having the necessity for different diameters for the<br>
borings in the nozzle strip and whereby greater problems in respect to cleaning of the<br>
nozzle strip are not to be expected.<br>
For achievement of this object, it is proposed for a device of the aforementioned type that<br>
there is arranged in the flow channel of the nozzle strip at least one unilaterally attached<br>
restricting strip projecting to one side whose free edge forms a flow-through slot with the<br>
side of the flow channel. This design allows, in a simple manner, an adjustment of the<br>
amount of substance flowing into the exit region of the nozzle strip in that the flow-<br>
through slot is kept rather wide, which is made possible through simple replacement of<br>
the restricting strip. Such a replacement is relatively simple because of the unilateral<br>
attachment and cleaning is also made possible in a relatively simple manner. In addition,<br>
borings in the nozzle strip, which are adjustable in their diameter to the amount to be<br>
extruded, can be eliminated. The flow channel in the nozzle strip can be provided with a<br>
large cross section and serves as a kind of a calming path for feeding the masses to be<br>
extruded since the flow-through slot determining the through-flowing amount of<br>
substance lies only behind these flow channels. In addition, said flow channels do not<br>
tend to become clogged because of their larger cross section.<br>
It has been shown to be of advantage if the flow-through slot lies on the side of the nozzle<br>
strip that forms the front edge of the nozzle strip, as viewed in the rotating direction of<br>
the drum. Through this design, it is achieved in a relatively simple manner that the entire<br>
discharge groove of the nozzle strip - which lies opposite the inner circumference of the<br>
rotatable drum - is filled with the substance to be extruded and sufficient time can be<br>
made available, depending on the width of said discharge groove, so that the substances<br>
to be extruded pass through the apertures of the rotatable drum and fall off in form of<br>
droplets.<br>
In development of the invention, the restricting strip can be fastened by means of screws<br>
that run from the open side of the discharge groove through openings in the area of the<br>
restricting strip edge. This type of fastening is simple and makes rapid replacement<br>
possible. Two restricting strips can also be arranged in an advantageous manner one<br>
behind the other so that their flow-through slot lies on opposite sites. A sort of a<br>
labyrinth passage is created thereby through which the mass to be extruded must flow<br>
before reaching the apertures of the rotatable drum. This leads to calming of the flow,<br>
especially when higher throughputs are desired, which is necessary for flawless droplet<br>
shaping.<br>
In development of the invention, the restricting strip can also be arranged at an angle to<br>
the inflow direction of the substance in such a manner that the free strip edge lies<br>
downstream from the attached edge. The restricting strip serves then also as flow guiding<br>
means, which can also lead to flow calming of the exiting substance. Especially in such a<br>
design there can be proposed in the development of the invention that the side of the<br>
restricting strip facing away from the discharge groove of the nozzle strip lies opposite to<br>
the projections on the groove bottom, whereby said projections form at least one or<br>
preferably a plurality of restricting slots together with the restricting strip lying behind<br>
one another in the flow direction. These restriction points lying one behind the other in<br>
the flow direction can also be employed as flow-calming means, depending on viscosity<br>
and nature of the substance to be extruded.<br>
However, the invention makes also it also possible to extrude larger amounts of<br>
substances without letting flow conditions enter the turbulence range, such as through the<br>
increase of the Reynold's number, which could endanger flawless droplet shaping.<br>
In deveiopment of the invention it is proposed that the ratio of the diameter of the<br>
aperture to the diameter of the drum is greater than 1:150 and that a transition piece with<br>
a connecting passage is provided between the nozzle strip and the feed tube extending<br>
axially inside the drum whereby said feed tube does not completely fill the interior of the<br>
drum, and whereby there is at least one restricting path provided in said connecting<br>
passage for additional calming and distribution of the through-flowing substance over its<br>
axial length. In development of the invention, said connecting passage can be designed<br>
as a passage extending through nearly the entire axial length of the drum whereby said<br>
passage narrows in form of a wedge in the flow direction. It has been shown that through<br>
such a design - in which a considerably larger diameter of the rotatable drum can be<br>
provided compared to heretofore known designs - considerably larger amounts of<br>
substances can be flawlessly released in the form of droplets since it is ensured that the<br>
flow conditions of the substances to be extruded can remain laminar so that there is no<br>
chance that the droplet-release process does not take place in the desired manner. There<br>
is also the advantage reached that an extraordinary stability and greater strength can be<br>
achieved because of the clearly larger diameter of the rotating drum, which can now be<br>
approximately 250 mm even when the material strength of the drum is not considerably<br>
increased compared to known designs. This greater strength allows for the realization of<br>
greater axial lengths and thus greater belt widths so that production can be increased as<br>
well through this measure. Because of the employed larger diameter of the rotatable<br>
drum, its speed can be a kept in a range in which the centrifugal forces can be controlled,<br>
in spite of the production increase, so that the novel device for producing granulates does<br>
not have the tendency to let any material possibly adhering to the drum be radially<br>
released in the form of a spray because of the lower circumferential velocity.<br>
The use of larger drum diameters makes also sufficient space available for installation so<br>
that such a device is favorable for assembly even if the outer measurements are increased.<br>
The feed tube extending axially in the inner cavity of the drum must be provided with<br>
separate heating. There is still sufficient space inside the drum for such an arrangement,<br>
which can also run along the axially extending transition piece leading to the nozzle strip.<br>
In the following, the invention is described and illustrated in the drawings with the aid of<br>

viewing direction of arrow X;<br>
FIG. 11 shows a cross section through a nozzle strip similar to the one of the illustration<br>
in FIG. 6, but being in another embodiment;<br>
FIG. 12 shows the cross section of an additional embodiment of the nozzle strip;<br>
FIG. 13 shows also a further embodiment of a nozzle strip that is similar to the one in<br>
FIG. 11 and FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. I shows that the rotor drop shaper illustrated in cross section consists of three parts:<br>
mainly, a fixed cylindrical inner body 1, which extends with an axially-running feed<br>
channel 2 for the substance to be granulated, and having a flow channel 3 radially<br>
branching-off from said feed channel 2 and a recess 4 adjacent to said flow channel 3<br>
leading to the outer circumference of the inner body 1, as well as a nozzle strip 5 held<br>
radially slidable in said recess 4; a rotating drum 6 revolving around the cylindrical inner<br>
body 1; and a cooling and conveyor belt 7 moving under said drum. The inner body 1 is<br>
equipped with two heating ducts 8 running parallel to said feed channel and the nozzle<br>
strip 5 is pushed radially toward the outside by a pressure spring 9 in the recess 4 so that<br>
said nozzle strip 5 rests against the inner circumference of the rotating drum 6.<br>
The nozzle strip 5 itself is illustrated again in FIG. 2 through FIG. 4 and it is shown that<br>
said nozzle strip 5 is provided with connecting borings which transform into apertures 11<br>
of a somewhat smaller diameter. The apertures 11 lead to a groove-shaped recess 12 that<br>
is open toward the rotating inner circumference of said drum. A restricting strip 13 is<br>
fastened to said recess by means of screws 14, which lead through the strip 13 in the area<br>
of a side edge and which are screwed down in the body of the nozzle strip 5. Said screws<br>
14 are thereby accessible from the open side of the recess 12. The detached and free edge<br>
13a of the restricting strip 13 forms a flow-through slot 15 of a width s together with the<br>
side 12a of recess 12. This flow-through slot 15 serves as a restricting point for the<br>
material to be extruded coming through the feed channel 2 and said slot 15 determines<br>
the developing shape of the droplets 15 together with the temperature-dependent<br>
viscosity of the substance to be granulated in addition to the pressure whereby said<br>
droplets 15 solidify on the belt 7 where they can be subsequently packaged in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
As it can be clearly seen, the width s of the slot 15 can be determined through the width<br>
of the restricting strip 13. It can also be seen that this restricting strip 13 can be inserted<br>
into the nozzle strip 5 in a simple manner. Cleaning is also easily possible because of the<br>
good accessibility, if necessary.<br>
FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show another embodiment of a so-called rotor drop shaper wherein the<br>
guide for the rotating drum 60 has been eliminated at the circumference of the inner body<br>
1, as it is the case in FIG. 1. The perforated drum 60 is actually attached on flanges 20<br>
and 21 in the area of its two ends whereby the flanges themselves are mounted with hub<br>
elements on shaft stubs 22 or 23, which project axially from a feed tube 24 that runs<br>
coaxial to the drum in the cavity of the drum 60 and at a distance to its inner<br>
circumference. The hub 25 connected to the flange 20 is thereby secured on a bearing 26<br>
that is connected to fixed support elements 27. The hub 25 is also provided with a drive<br>
wheel 28 which can be rotated by a belt drive or a chain drive 29 and a drive motor 30,<br>
which is not further illustrated. The shaft stub 23 of the feed tube 24 is designed in the<br>
form of a pipe encompassing a coaxially extending inner tube 31 (see also FIG. 8), which<br>
serves as feed channel for the substance to be granulated and which leads into the tube-<br>
shaped feed channel 24. The substance to be granulated is fed from the outside in the<br>
direction of arrow 32. Heating of the tube 31 and the feed tube 24 is provided to prevent<br>
cooling of the substance or to heat the same whereby the heated areas are the inner spaces<br>
34, 35 defined by the shaft stud 23 and the feed tube 31 and the partition 33 (FIG. 8) and<br>
by the cavities 34a and 35a surrounding the inner feed tube 24. A heating medium is<br>
moved in the direction of arrow 36 into the space 34, flows through the space 34 and<br>
space 34a up to the end 37 and it is subsequently returned to the entrance area where it<br>
leaves space 35 in the direction of arrow 38 through a corresponding discharge nozzle.<br>
The shaft stub 22 of the feed tube 24 is also secured in a bearing 39 on a fixed support<br>
element 27 and serves as a bearing surface for the hub of the flange 21.<br>
As it is shown in FIG. 6, the inside of the cavity of the drum 60 has a very large diameter<br>
so that there is a large space created inside the drum 60, which makes assembly of the<br>
device relatively simple, and whereby said drum is rotated in the direction of arrow 40 in<br>
such a manner that circumferential velocity is the same and is in the same direction as the<br>
movement of the belt 7 moving in the direction of arrow 41. The large drum diameter<br>
permits also to make the axial length of the drum relatively great without experiencing<br>
problems with material strength. This means also that an increase in production is made<br>
possible alone for this reason. However, production increase is also possible because of<br>
the selected larger diameter of the drum since there is the possibility now to increase the<br>
circumferential velocity and not let the centrifugal forces become too great because of an<br>
excess speed. Added thereto is also the fact that the region of the drum, which faces the<br>
belt 7 moving underneath and which is still close enough to the belt to effect the droplet-<br>
release process, is also larger because of the larger curvature in this region of the drum so<br>
that the width of the nozzle strip, as seen in the movement direction 41 of the belt 7, can<br>
also become considerably greater, which can be clearly observed from comparison of<br>
FIG. 1 and FIG. 6.<br>
A transition piece 42 is provided to bridge the space between the feed tube 24 and the<br>
lower region of the drum 60 whereby said transition piece 42 has the shape of a strip with<br>
the approximate width of the belt 7. The transition piece 42 is provided with a<br>
downwardly narrowing, wedge-shaped inflow area 43 at the region facing the feed tube<br>
24, as shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 10, whereby a guide plate 44 protrudes into said inflow<br>
area 43 fastened only at one edge with screws 45 in a similar manner as the restricting<br>
strip 13'. A gap S3 is created between the free edge of the guide plate 44 and the slanted<br>
side 43a of the wedge-shaped inflow area whereby said gap S3 serves for apportioning the<br>
amount of substance to be extruded entering the neighboring area. The wedge-shaped<br>
inflow area 43, as it is shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 10, transforms into an opening designed<br>
as a cylindrical boring 46 or as a elongated orifice 46a, which projects into the recess 48<br>
of the transition piece 42 wherein a fastening screw 49 is disposed to fasten the transition<br>
piece 42 to the tube 24. The nozzle strip 50 is slidably arranged in the recess 48 having<br>
parallel sides whereby said nozzle strip 50 is pushed downwardly by means of a pressure<br>
spring 51 and it is pushed with its two legs defining the groove-like recess 12 against the<br>
inner circumference of the drum 60. The transition piece 47 is held in its position by said<br>
spring 51 at the same time.<br>
The nozzle strip 50 is provided with a restricting strip 13' at a distance to the bottom, just<br>
as the nozzle strip 5, whose free edge forms a gap with a width S1 together with the side<br>
12a. This gap can serve for apportioning of the mass extruded through the aperture 52 of<br>
the drum 60 in the same manner as already described with the aid of FIG. 1. The gap S1<br>
is here already arranged on the side of the nozzle strip 50, which is the first inner edge of<br>
the nozzle strip 50 as seen in the rotational direction 40 of the drum 60 or in the<br>
movement direction 41 of the belt 7.<br>
As it is also shown in FIG. 6, it is also possible to additionally attach a strip-type<br>
projection 53 at the bottom of the groove-like recess 12, which forms thereby an<br>
additional gap with the width S2 together with the restricting strip 13'. This gap serves to<br>
calm the through-flowing amount of substance that is partially blocked here inside the<br>
flow channel 46 and behind the guide plate 44. This measure leads to the fact that a<br>
viscous flow is generally maintained at a relatively large throughput of the substance to<br>
be processed, which ensures the desired droplet shaping in the region between the two<br>
sides of the nozzle strip 50.<br>
FIG. 11 through FIG. 13 show other designs of the nozzle strip 50, which were therefore<br>
provided with the reference numbers 50a, 50b and 50c.<br>
In case of FIG. 11, the nozzle strip 50a is mainly provided with a first restricting strip<br>
13', roughly in the same manner as it is the case in FIG. 6. Apertures 43 and the groove-<br>
like recesses 12 are not illustrated in detail in FIG. 11 through FIG. 13. In FIG. 11,<br>
however, the nozzle strip 50 is additionally provided with a second restricting strip 13',<br>
which is also attached only unilaterally on a projection shoulder 54, in this case, in the<br>
region of one of the legs of the C-shaped nozzle strip 50a. The two restricting strips 13'<br>
and 13" form in this way a second passage gap with one of the sides of the recess 12<br>
having a labyrinth-type passage in between for the substance to be released in droplets.<br>
Such a design serves to calm the flow, should it be necessary, depending on the viscosity<br>
of the substance to be processed.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a nozzle strip 50b whereby the restricting strip 13' is slanted at an angle to<br>
the inflow occurring in the direction of axis 55, particularly in such a manner that its free<br>
edge lies lower than the attached edge in the flow direction. The restricting strip 13'<br>
serves therefore as a flow guide-plate. It also serves to slow-down the through-flowing<br>
amount of substance and it can also be employed in this design in a relationship to the<br>
flow characteristics and the flow-through amount of the substance to be processed.<br>
This also applies to the nozzle strip 50c in FIG. 13 whereby the restricting strip 13' is<br>
inserted at an angle to the flow direction in the same manner as in FIG. 12. However, the<br>
recess 12 of the nozzle strip 50c is here provided with a plurality of ribs 56, arranged one<br>
behind the other, and oriented toward the restricting strip 13', respectively, whereby said<br>
ribs 56 form themselves a passage gap with the surface of the restricting strip 13'. This<br>
measure is also a measure which serves to calm the flow and which does not influence<br>
the droplet shaping in an undesired manner through a flow velocity that is too high.<br>
