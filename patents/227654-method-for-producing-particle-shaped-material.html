				<td>Method for Producing Particle-Shaped Material<br>
The invention pertains to a method for controlled production of particle-shaped material from<br>
the molten substance.<br>
Production of particle-shaped material from molten substance is known for plastic, natural<br>
substances, glasses and even metals. There is a constantly increasing demand for powders of<br>
such types of materials having small grain size.<br>
These known methods produce a particle-shaped material which can also be referred to as<br>
powder, granulate, smalls or something similar. For the sake of simplicity, these particle-<br>
shaped materials are referred to below as powder. These kinds of powders are used for<br>
example in injection moulding techniques, production of alloys, sintering techniques, bonding<br>
materials, catalysts, paints and lacquers, cellular plastic production etc. The market for these<br>
applications has a high demand of powder having small grain size of certain particle shapes in<br>
large quantities at low cost. Till now these types of powders were produced a.o., in that - as<br>
described for example in the document WO 01/62987, fluid fused substances like oxidic slag,<br>
glasses or fused metal are nozzle-jetted or atomised in some other way in a chamber by high<br>
pressure gas expansion - for example, with the help of rotating plates/discs which centrifuge<br>
away the generated droplets and thus pulverise (Rotating Disc Method), or even by means of<br>
Roller Atomisation - whereby molten metal droplets meet on rotating rollers and are<br>
centrifuged away from them and get solidified on the flight path. Another typical method is<br>
water atomisation. To a large extent however, mainly gas atomisation is used. For this,<br>
nozzles, like Laval-nozzles are used, in which the fluid molten substance is first strongly<br>
accelerated and thereafter sporadically expanded under strong acceleration to a high velocity<br>
at the nozzle exit into a chamber and thus atomised.<br>
A typical method is described in the Austrian patent document 2987350 of Eckart-Werke.<br>
Ideally, the molten substance is further distributed by gas currents simultaneously along with<br>
this sporadic expansion at the nozzle outlet and thus finely distributed fused droplets are<br>
obtained which get solidified on cooling and thus form the powder. Hence the known generic<br>
method consists of bringing a material melt after exit out of the nozzle in contact with gas and<br>
simultaneously sporadically expanding it. This known method is disadvantageous to the<br><br>
extent that it was very difficult to control, had to be interrupted very frequently and could not<br>
be carried out continuously. Finally, the energy costs were also very high.<br>
From the document WO 99/11407 of Pacific Metals Co. Ltd. it is known that one can obtain<br>
metallic powder through atomisation of fused-fluid metal, in that an away current of the<br>
fused-fluid metal is atomised at the exit of a nozzle by introducing it into the centre of the<br>
nozzle along with a laminar gas current enveloping it and by introducing a fluid current on an<br>
exit of both the currents from a conical nozzle, which strengthen the atomisation. In this case,<br>
in addition to the gas current a fluid current should also be provided, which is complicated.<br>
From the document EP-A-103 8976 a method is known, in which sprayed molten droplets in<br>
the inner region of a spray jet are heated up once again in the inner region of a cooled cooling<br>
chamber by means of post-combustion of hot gases after exit from the spray nozzle and thus a<br>
better distribution of the molten droplets is achieved by means of the heated combusting gases<br>
and hence the fineness of the produced powder is improved. This method is very energy-<br>
intensive, as it requires cooling of the walls of the cooling chamber and also cumbersome<br>
measures will have to be carried out for producing small particle sizes.<br>
A disadvantage of the known method is also, that these did not try to control the particle size<br>
or shape ; a uniform particle size spectrum was generated by setting the gas/fluid-ratio, on<br>
which no other influence could be exercised.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to create a continuous, efficient method for controlled<br>
production of powders from material melts, which would allow control of size and shape of<br>
the produced particles.<br>
This task is fulfilled by the invention with the help of a method having the features as<br>
mentioned in patent claim 1. Advantageous extensions can be obtained from the relevant<br>
claims.<br>
It was surprisingly found out that with the help of the double setting of the gas/melt ratio as<br>
per the invention, in the first mixing step within the melt and with the sporadic expansion at<br>
the nozzle exit, the particle size spectrum is controllable with respect to the average particle<br>
size as well as with respect to the total particle size distribution spectrum, whereby with the<br><br>
consumption of the same amount of gas smaller particles can be attained than in the case of<br>
methods which feed gas only once.<br>
In the first mixing step, on addition of more gas to the melt, the average particle size gets<br>
reduced.<br>
The ratio of the mass flows of both phases GLR=mgas:mliq (Gas/Liquid-Ratio) is determined<br>
by the following factors:<br>
1)	The inlet cross sections into the mixing chamber Agas or ALiq,<br>
2)	The preliminary pressures P0.gas or P0.liq at the inlet.<br>
According to the invention, both these factors can be regulated as desired, in order to ensure a<br>
constant ratio GRL during nozzle-jetting. The influence of the GLR on the powder fineness is<br>
shown in fig. 4. From that one can see that by regulating the inlet cross sections Agas or Aliq<br>
or with the help of the available preliminary pressures B0.gas or B0.liq, both of which conform<br>
to the mass ratio of both components, the particle fineness can be controlled.<br>
Addition of further gases at the nozzle exit leads to even finer material. For this, it is<br>
important to know the flow ratios in the mixing chamber: depending on the empty pipe<br>
velocity J of the fluid and gaseous phase (VLRI = mi/A), different flow regimes could get<br>
formed (fig. 6); in the method as per the invention one works with blow flow or ring-(spray-)<br>
flow. The empty pipe velocity for gas JG and liquid JL can be obtained by the experts from<br>
the diagram shown in fig. 7.<br>
Blow Flow<br>
While working in the region of blow flow in the mixing chamber the gas phase does not form<br>
any bubbles which expand on account of drop in pressure and then burst at the point of<br>
maximum pressure drop (in the region of drop exit). The continuous liquid phase is thereby<br>
divided into ligaments which disintegrate into droplets in a second step. The critical<br>
parameter for this secondary droplet disintegration is the relative WEBER-NUMBER Werel<br>
(see Wallis, G. B: (1969) - One-Dimensional Two-Phase Flow: New York: Mcgraw-Hill)<br><br><br>
For Vrel = Vgas - Vliq relative velocity between gas and liquid (m/sec)<br>
ddrop = diameter of the liquid drop (m)<br>
(Pgas = density of the gas. (kg/m3)<br>
σ = surface tension of the melt (N/m).<br>
For secondary drop disintegration Werel 
In order to achieve secondary drop disintegration with a water drop size of say ddrop = 50μm at<br>
the nozzle exit, a relative velocity would be required between the drop and the surrounding<br>
gas of around 125 m/s, which however can never be attained on account of the limiting two-<br>
phase sound velocity. Now by bringing up an outer mixing one surprisingly gets the required<br>
velocity, in order to atomise the ligaments and drops present at the nozzle exit in an energy-<br>
efficient manner. In this way, with the gas velocity of the outer mixing, the particle diameter<br>
of the powder can be controlled. The above mentioned relation between the dimensionless<br>
Weber number holds good for all liquids (even metals). This means that with the help of this<br>
method one can also process Cu, Al, Zn, Sn etc. to powder.<br>
In the following tables the critical velocities are given, which are necessary for a secondary<br>
atomisation for a 50um drop of various metals:<br><br>
In case of atomisation of metals and other materials the following should further be taken into<br>
account, the time required for secondary drop atomisation is often longer for materials than<br>
the time which the drop takes for solidification. Also because of this, one cannot achieve<br>
such a good result in the drop (= powder) fineness with a purely internal mixing.<br><br>
Ring Flow<br>
With increasing gas flows in the mixing chamber the bubbles coalesce and a ring-shaped<br>
liquid film gets formed along the chamber walls, the gas flows in the core of the chamber and<br>
rips with increasing velocity (for example, in case of pressure drops) droplets out of the liquid<br>
film.<br>
The liquid film present at the nozzle exit (the disintegration mechanism described for blow<br>
flow also occurs analogously in case of ring flow) are again subjected here to a secondary air<br>
fed from outside, which yields the required good atomising result, as one can see in fig. 8.<br>
The particle shape can also be similarly controlled by the method as per the invention; thus<br>
round particles are obtained for inert gas, whereas oblong particles occur particularly in case<br>
of hot gas (air). The particle shape can be of extreme importance for the application of the<br>
produced powder and is therefore a significant parameter.<br>
Due to the fact that initially a defined inner melt/gas mixing is produced and this is then<br>
expanded after producing this mixture by sporadically adding further gas, one surprisingly<br>
obtains a better crushing of the material droplets, a control of the particle shape as well as an<br>
adjustable particle size spectrum. It has also been surprisingly seen that the energy<br>
consumption of this method can be significantly reduced as compared to known gas<br>
atomisation methods which have to use significantly more gas at significantly higher pressure.<br>
The inner mixture of melt/gas from an atomising unit with a velocity increase of the liquid<br>
droplets expands to 30 - 100 times the conveying velocity from the melting container into a<br>
receiving container. The gas particles get accelerated even more strongly on account of their<br>
low mass and account for expansion of the exiting jet resulting in improved atomisation. For<br>
improving the atomisation, the expansion can be carried out by nozzle-jetting the inner<br>
material mixture into a chamber having lower pressure. The chamber can also be cooled in<br>
order to accelerate the cooling.<br>
For fused metals it could be particularly advantageous to set the inner material of the gas<br>
mixture to a ratio gas flow/molten material of 0.05 - 15, preferably 0.05 - 3 and more ideally<br>
0.3-1.5 kg-/kg of molten material.<br><br>
As material, for example, meltable plastic offers itself- plastic granulates are required for<br>
injection moulding machines etc. Furthermore, nozzle-jettable material say from recycling<br>
material can be considered and the thus produced granulates can be further used in a very<br>
simple manner - e.g. as additive for cement or similar items. Other suitable materials are<br>
metals like Zn, Ni, Al, Ag, Ng, Si, Ca, Cu, Ni, Mo, Pb, Ti, Sn, Li, Be, W, Fe, Co, Cr, Mn, Be<br>
and especially their alloys. Metals in powder form are desired for the most varied for<br>
applications, e.g. for metal casting, like injection moulding, for bonding materials, catalysts,<br>
paints, colours.<br>
For all these applications it is apparent that also the particle shape plays an important role;<br>
thus round particles have a different shower behaviour and angular friction and are better<br>
suited for complete filling up of moulds without hollow spaces and can more easily be<br>
conveyed on account of lower inner friction than oblong, spurting particles which have<br>
greater friction against one another, which however is desirable for different application<br>
forms, e.g. for producing mouldings or for extrusion moulding.<br>
According to the method as per the invention the most varied melts, like glasses and meltable<br>
ceramics, metals can be nozzle-jetted. However, even meltable natural substances like grease<br>
or wax which are solid at surrounding temperature can be processed.<br>
As gases one can use gases known as suitable to the expert for the material to be nozzle-jetted<br>
- in case oxidation plays only a subordinate role, the gas could be precious air - one could<br>
however also work with inert gas which does not react to a noteworthy extent with the<br>
material to be nozzle-jetted - e. g. nitrogen or argon. Ideally the gas is selected from the<br>
group consisting of inert gases, like inert gas, helium, argon, nitrogen - which also influence<br>
the particle shape - or gases partially reacting with the melt like nitrogen, air, carbon dioxide,<br>
carbon monoxide, water vapour, combustion gas or even mixtures of the same, whereby the<br>
classification of the gas as inert gas depends on the nature of the material to be nozzle-jetted,<br>
as is known to the expert. The combustion gases include especially also combustion gases<br>
produced in situ. By combustion gas generated in situ one refers to such a gas which is<br>
formed in the melt from the combustible components - e.g. by addition of hydrocarbons to the<br>
melt which also have oxidation-inducing components - e.g. oxygen-containing components.<br><br>
Due to combustion the gas volume suddenly increases manifold and the mixture of gas/melt<br>
get swirled through.<br>
In a typical application of the method, the melt particles of the inner mixture is accelerated to<br>
5-100 times the velocity during an explosion-pipe expansion at the nozzle exit, whereby<br>
they get solidified. A typical particle velocity in the mixture which is conveyed in a pipe to<br>
the mixing chamber is 0.1m/sec. and is then accelerated to 50 - 100 m/sec. during nozzle-<br>
jetting. The gas particles of the mixture get accelerated significantly higher on account of<br>
their lower mass, somewhat to the magnitude of 1000-times.<br>
Further objectives, features and advantages can be obtained from the following description<br>
and the claims along with the accompanying drawings. The following are shown:<br>

Preferred design versions are described below - this is however not restricted in any way to<br>
this application - with the help of this method, similarly other meltable material, other metals<br>
e.g. nickel, tin, silicon, titanium, metal alloys like bronze ; glass or even glasses, meltable<br>
plastics (thermoplastics), natural substances like grease and wax as well as other materials can<br>
be pulverised.<br><br>
In fig. 1 the process sequence according to the principle of the invention is schematically<br>
depicted. As shown, the method includes the production of a melt by melting at increased<br>
temperature; mixing of the melt (in case of metals) in a ratio of gas/metal of approx. 0.05 - 15<br>
kg/kg. The mixing should be internal as far as possible, so that the gas is uniformly mixed in<br>
larger quantity below the melt. After the mixing step the thus produced gas/liquid mixture is<br>
sporadically expanded by a nozzle and sent into a region having lower pressure, whereby the<br>
material droplets get solidified and become particles with particle size of 
get solidified during flight and collect in the collecting container. Simultaneously with the<br>
sporadic expansion, gas is once again fed at the nozzle exit, whereby an even stronger<br>
expansion of the material droplet current results; these are distributed in a finer manner and a<br>
controlled/regulated finer particle size spectrum is produced. This depends to a large extent<br>
on the type of material thus atomised and the gas used, as has been described in details above.<br>
In fig. 2 a diagram of a portion of a plant for conducting the method as per invention is<br>
shown. These types of plants are known to the expert in all important aspects. A typical plant<br>
is, for example, the one described in the document DE-A-2007 803. The known plants are<br>
now extended by the invention in such a way that a mixing unit is used for producing the<br>
inner gas/material mixture before the nozzle. Such mixing units for gas/melt mixtures are<br>
known to the expert and can be selected by him conforming to the melts to be processed, like<br>
electromagnetic stirring, finely distributed introduction of gas, like through fritting etc.<br>
A typical ratio of gas/material in the inner mixture should lie - e.g. for aluminium - in the<br>
range of 10 - 60% by weight. On using inert gas one could use lesser gas, in the region of 10<br>
- 30% by weight; in case of air and gas the ratio lies between 20 - 60% by weight of gas in<br>
the mixture.<br>
By varying the gas content the particle size distribution can be postponed here - the average<br>
value of the particle size varies. Furthermore, significantly lesser air needs to be used than in<br>
the gas atomisation method according to the state-of-the-art technology. Now it is possible,<br>
instead of a gas/metal ratio of 10:1 in the state-of-the-art technology which feeds gas only<br>
once, to work with a ratio of 0.5 - 1.5 kg/kg of gas/metal, which means a significant saving,<br>
as only approx. 1/10 of the gas quantity has to be fed in order to obtain comparable average<br>
particle sizes; furthermore, the methods according to the state-of-the-art technology do not<br>
allow for control/regulation of the particle shape or the particle size spectrum.<br><br>
A typical nozzle used in such types of applications for sporadic expansion is shown in fig. 3.<br>
Here one can clearly identify the introduction of gas in the exit region of the gas/material<br>
mixture, which leads to a better guiding of the current of the exiting material and significantly<br>
reduces a fixation of the solidified material on the nozzle and reduces the particle size.<br>
One can thus surprisingly see that by using a gas/material melt mixture, the addition of gas<br>
while using nozzles with gas entry at the exit of the melt can be significantly reduced for the<br>
same yield of material powder and the particle size spectrum as well as the particle shape can<br>
be controlled.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Zinc<br>
Zinc is melted at a temperature of approx. 500°C (melting point: 420°C). The liquid metal is<br>
mixed with air in a mixing chamber in a ratio of 1 Kg air/Kg Zn and then nozzle-jetted by a<br>
Laval-nozzle connected to the mixing chamber, whereby air is introduced once again at the<br>
nozzle exit in a ratio of approx. 0.5 kg/kg. Powder with an average grain size of d50 = 70μm<br>
and a particle size between 3 and 200μm was obtained. The particles had an oblong,-spurting<br>
shape.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of a Zinc-Copper-Alloy<br>
A zinc-copper alloy is melted at a temperature of approx. 800°C. The liquid metal is mixed<br>
with air in a mixing chamber in a ratio of 1 Kg air/kg zinc-copper alloy and then nozzle-jetted<br>
through a Laval-nozzle connected to the mixing chamber, whereby air is once again<br>
introduced at the nozzle exit in a ratio of approx. 0.5 Kg/Kg. Powder with an average of grain<br>
size d50 : 60μm and particle size between 3 and 200μm was obtained. The particles had an<br>
oblong,-spurting shape.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Copper<br>
Copper is melted at a temperature of approx. 1220°C. The liquid metal is mixed with air in a<br>
mixing chamber in a ratio of 2 Kg air/Kg Cu and then nozzle-jetted through a Laval-nozzle<br>
connected to the mixing chamber, whereby air is once again introduced at the nozzle exit in a<br>
ratio of 1.5 Kg/Kg Cu. Powder with an average grain size of dso : 76um and a particle size<br>
between 3 and 200um was obtained. The particles were almost round.<br><br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Aluminium<br>
Aluminium is melted at a temperature of approx. 700°C. The liquid metal is mixed with air in<br>
a ratio of 0.4 Kg air/1 Kg Al in a mixing chamber and then nozzle-jetted through a Laval-<br>
nozzle, whereby during nozzle-jetting 0.4 Kg air/Kg Al was added. Powder having an<br>
average grain size d50: 45 μm was obtained, whereby the grain shape was oblong to round.<br>
On using a ratio of 2 Kg of air/Kg Al an average grain size d50 = 28. μm was obtained.<br>
Leaving out the addition of gas at the nozzle-exit led to a changed grain size average (see fig.<br>
4 and 5) for the same quantity of gas/melted metal. One can clearly identify the favourable<br>
influence of external air feeding on the grain size in fig. 5. With increasing air feeding the<br>
grain size drops, whereby this influence on application of external air for the same air/metal<br>
ratio results in significantly smaller particles. As one can see from fig. 8, for the same<br>
quantity of air fed the addition of air in a mixing chamber and subsequently at the nozzle exit<br>
results in significantly smaller particle size than feeding the same air mixture in the mixing<br>
chamber alone; here the average particle size gets reduced by half.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Magnesium<br>
Magnesium is melted at a temperature of approx. 700°C under nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
liquid metal is mixed with nitrogen in a ratio of 1 Kg N2/l Kg Mg in a mixing chamber and<br>
then nozzle-jetted through a Laval-nozzle, whereby during nozzle jetting 0.5.Kg N2/Kg Mg<br>
was added. Powder with an average of d50 : 70um was obtained, whereby the grain shape was<br>
oblong to round. On using a ratio of 0.2 kg N2/ Mg an average grain size of d50 = 54. μm was<br>
obtained. Leaving out the addition of nitrogen to the mixing chamber resulted in larger<br>
particles with dso = 180μm for the same gas quantity/Mg. Leaving out the gas addition at the<br>
nozzle exit led to a size of d50 = 120μm. From this one can conclude that only double gas<br>
addition delivers the desired effect.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Steel<br>
Steel is melted at approx. 1550°C. The liquid metal is mixed with nitrogen in a mixing<br>
chamber at a ratio of 1 Kg N2/l Kg of steel and then nozzle-jetted through a Laval-nozzle,<br>
whereby during nozzle-jetting once again 0.5 Kg N2/Kg of steel was added. Powder with an<br>
average of grain size of dso : 80μm was obtained, whereby the grain shape was oblong to<br>
round. On using a ratio of approx. 2 Kg N2/Kg of steel an average grain size of d50 = 62μum<br><br>
was obtained. Leaving out the addition of gas to the mixing chamber led to powder with d50 =<br>
221 μm for the same gas quantity/molten metal. Leaving out addition of gas at the nozzle exit<br>
led to choking of the nozzle.<br>
Nozzle-Jetting of Slag<br>
Slag from raw iron production is melted at a temperature of 1400°C. The liquid material is<br>
mixed with air at a ration of 0.7 Kg of air/Kg of slag and the mixture is then nozzle-jetted<br>
through a Laval-nozzle, whereby at the nozzle exit once again 0.7 Kg of air/Kg of slag was<br>
added. Powder of average grain size of d50 : 150μm was obtained.<br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1.	Method for production of particle-shaped material from the melt with<br>
the following steps:<br>
-	melting of the material;<br>
-	inner mixing of the molten material with a gas in a pre-defined<br>
ratio;<br>
-	sporadic expanding of the gas/liquid mixture; and<br>
-	collection of the thus produced material powder, wherein<br>
-	addition of further gas in a pre-defined air/liquid ratio during the<br>
expansion under solidification of the formed material droplets to<br>
the material powder in a controlled size distribution and shape<br>
into a chamber having lower pressure than the gas/liquid<br>
mixture.<br><br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the material powder is<br>
separated in grain sizes.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim lor 2, wherein the first mixture of the<br>
molten material with gas takes place shortly before the sporadic<br>
expansion.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in any one of the previous claims, wherein the<br>
melt/gas mixture expands in a conveying pipe to the mixing chamber<br>
with a velocity increase of 10-100 times the original velocity of the gas<br>
of liquid mixture.<br>
5. The method as claimed in any one of the previous claims, wherein the<br>
expansion is carried out in a chamber having lower temperature than the<br>
melt.<br><br>
6.	The method as claimed in any one of the previous claims, wherein the<br>
inner material/gas mixture has a ratio of gas to material of 0.5-15,<br>
preferably 0.5-3 and ideally 0.3-1.5 kg/kg.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in any one of the previous claims, wherein the<br>
material is meltable plastic, metal, especially selected from the group<br>
consisting of Zn, Ni, Al, Ag, Mg, Si, Ca, Cu, Ni, Mo, Pb, Ti, Sn, Li, Be,<br>
W, Fe, Co, Cr, Mn and particularly also their alloys, a natural substance<br>
or slag.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in any one of the previous claims, wherein the<br>
gas is selected from the group consisting of inert gases, like precious<br>
gas, helium, argon, nitrogen, or gases partially reacting with the<br>
molten material, like nitrogen , air, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,<br>
water vapour, combustion gas generated in situ or even mixtures of<br>
these, whereby the classification of the gas as inert gas depends on<br>
the type of material to be nozzle-jeeted.<br>
9.	Device for producing particle-shaped material controlled with respect to<br>
shape and size distribution, wherein a melting crucible, a pre-chamber<br>
with gas inlet connected to the melting crucible, a nozzle with a gas<br>
feed inlet at the nozzle exit connected to the pre-chamber.<br><br>
The invention pertains to a method for production of particle=-shaped material<br>
from the melt with the following steps:<br>
Melting of the material; internal mixing of the molten material with a gas;<br>
sporadic expansion of the gas/liquid mixture with addition of a further gas under<br>
solidification of the formed material droplets to a material powder into a chamber<br>
having lower pressure than the gas/liquid mixture; and collection of the thus<br>
formed material powder.</td>
