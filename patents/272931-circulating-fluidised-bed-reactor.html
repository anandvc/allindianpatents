				<td>Description<br>
Circulating fluidised bed reactor<br>
The invention relates to	a circulating fluidised bed<br>
reactor, particularly for	burning fuels and also to a<br>
method  for  operating  a	circulating  fluidised  bed<br>
reactor.<br>
These fluidised bed reactors are used in power engineering and power station technology, among other applications. There, coal or other combustible materials such as waste or biomass, for example, are burned in the fluidised bed of the reactor or combustion chamber. In order to separate and cool the ash or solid material formed during the combustion of the fuel, the lower area of the combustion chamber is connected to an ash or solid cooler. Mechanical coolers such as cooling screw conveyors, cooling vibrator chutes etc. as well as coolers with stationary fluidised beds such as fluidised bed coolers, ash sifters, stripper coolers etc. are known as solid coolers.<br>
These fluidised bed or solid coolers for cooling the excess ash from circulating fluidised bed reactors can either be installed directly on the lower area of the fluidised bed reactor or they can be arranged individually separately therefrom and connected to the combustion chamber by means of the corresponding pipes. The ash to be drawn off is fed to the solid cooler at the lower part of the combustion chamber through a draw-off opening, which is designed with a blocking or regulating member, and via a supply line. In the solid cooler which is designed with one or more chambers and which is acted upon by fluidising gas from below to achieve a fluidised layer, the fluent material or the<br><br>
fluent ash is, moved in a horizontal stream from the inlet side through the one or more chambers towards the outlet side opposite to the inlet side and is there discharged and led away. The solid material is firstly cooled directly by means of the fluidising gas and secondly indirectly by means of the tubular heat exchanger which dips into the solid fluidised bed and carries a cooling medium e.g. water, i.e. direct and indirect heat exchange takes place between the solid material and the two cooling media which are each supplied and removed separately. The fluidising gas passed through the solid fluidised bed emerges into a free board of the cooler above the fluidised bed and from there is passed back via a return pipe into the combustion chamber of the fluidised bed reactor.<br>
During  operation  of  the  aforesaid  fluidised  bed reactors with fluidised bed or solid coolers, it has been  found  that  sufficiently  high  fluidisation velocities of around 1 m/s are required to keep coarse solid  particles  in  suspension  inside  the  cooler. Otherwise, deposits of coarse solid material are formed which can result  in blockage  of the entire  solid cooler. As a result of the high fluidisation velocity required on one hand, the fine fraction of the solid material to be cooled is disadvantageously entrained or blown away with the fluidising gas and the cooler fluidised bed becomes depleted in fine material. As a consequence of the lack of fine material, a negatively acting reduction in the heat exchange inside the cooler is brought about. The consequence is a larger cooler with more heat exchanger heating area and an increased requirement for fluidising medium. This in turn results in an increased power requirement for the fluidising gas  blower,   resulting  in  a  reduction  in  the installation  efficiency.  Since  the  fine  material entrained with the fluidising gas stream is returned<br><br>
into the fluidised bed combustion chamber and enters into the solid cooler after a short time, the solid cooler is disadvantageously overloaded with fine material and the fine material is repeatedly cooled before it is actually discharged. As a result of the overloading, there is a risk that some of the solid stream will run in the bypass to the cooling chambers and the cooling performance will thereby be disadvantageously reduced since the residence time of the solid stream is no longer sufficient.<br>
A generic fluidised bed reactor has become known from the document EP 0 801 592 Bl. This known fluidised bed reactor comprises a fluidised bed cooler with three chambers, which is directly connected to the combustion chamber of the reactor, i.e. without pipes or channels and with only connecting openings and through which solid particles drawn off from the combustion chamber flow horizontally. Each of the three chambers charged with fluidising gas is constructed with a tubular heat exchanger used for cooling the drawn-off solid material.<br>
A fluidised bed cooler comprising a plurality of chambers, in the present case six chambers, each separated by baffles and exposed to fluidising gas from below to produce a fluidised bed in the chambers, has become known from the document DE OS 19 09 039. The fluent material which is supplied on one side of the cooler flows horizontally through the cooler with the aid of the fluidised bed, i.e., the fluent material or the solid material each overcomes a baffle in batches and continuously and in this way passes from the first to the last chamber before finally emerging on the side of the cooler opposite to the inlet. The cooling itself is effected in this case on the one hand, directly by means of the fluidising gas supplied from below and<br><br>
passing through the solid material and on the other hand indirectly by means of the tubular bundle immersed in the fluidised bed which carries a cooling medium in indirect heat exchange through the solid fluidised bed. The media used for direct and for indirect cooling are each supplied and removed separately.<br>
It is thus the object of this invention to provide a fluidised bed reactor wherein the aforesaid disadvantages are avoided or despite coarse solid particles being present in the solid cooler, the recirculation of fine material into the combustion chamber by means of fluidising gas is kept as low as possible or reduced. It is further the object of the present invention to provide a method for operating such a circulating fluidised bed reactor.<br>
The aforesaid object is achieved with regard to the circulating fluidised bed reactor by the characterising features of claim 1 and with regard to the method by the features of claim 11.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention can be deduced from the dependent claims.<br>
The solution according to the invention provides a circulating fluidised bed reactor and a method for operating a circulating fluidised bed reactor which has the following advantages:<br>
improved efficiency of the solid cooler;<br>
despite the elevated fluidisation velocity in the solid cooler, very fine ash particles can also be drawn off by means of a solid cooler from the combustion chamber of the fluidised bed reactor,<br><br>
- prevents hot, i.e. mostly non-cooled, solid material from bypassing in solid coolers comprising a plurality of chambers,<br>
more compact overall height because the height of the free board above the fluidised bed of the solid cooler can be reduced,<br>
the separator can be installed subsequently in existing solid coolers,<br>
very cost-effective.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the separator is embodied as a inertia vane separator which substantially consists of one or more U-, or V- or W-profiles or trapezoidal profiles open on one side and its profile openings are substantially directed towards the fluidising gas stream. By means of using such open box profiles, on the one hand a very inexpensive but on the other hand a very effective separator variant can be used.<br>
In an especially advantageous embodiment of the invention, the separator is embodied with at least one row of inertia vane separators, the inertia vane separators of each row being arranged adjacent to one another and spaced apart from one another and these inertia vane separators being arranged substantially perpendicular to the fluidising gas stream and if a plurality of rows are present, one behind the other seen in the direction of the fluidising gas stream. In this case, an appropriate embodiment provides that the inertia vane separators of one row seen in the direction of flow of the fluidising gas stream are arranged so that they are each staggered with respect to a row located upstream and/or downstream. The<br><br>
separation of fine material from the fluidising gas stream is optimised by these measures.<br>
It is appropriate to design the length of the inertia vane separators as at least 0.4 times the free-space height HF and/or to arrange the inertia vane separators or open box profiles within an angle a of +/-600 to the vertical. The mode of action of the separator can be positively influenced by these design measures.<br>
The separator can advantageously be constructed such that the separating performance is varied or regulated during operation by varying the angle of incidence β (the angle between the vertical and the separator flank) or laterally displacing the inertia vane separators or rows containing inertia vane separators or vertically displacing the separator.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the vertical fluidising velocity of the fluidising gas in the chambers is between 0.2 m/s and 1.8 m/s and the horizontal velocity of the fluidising gas in the free board is between 1 m/s and 5 m/s. Through this measure it is optimally achieved that even coarser solid particles can be held in suspension in the fluidised bed, thereby cooled and carried away whilst fine solid particles can be separated by the separator from the fluidising gas stream and fed back to the fluidised bed.<br>

Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing a circulating fluidised bed reactor 1 that exhibits a reactor or combustion chamber 2 in which a solid, lumpy fuel such as coal, waste, biomass etc. is burnt in the fluidised bed and a fluidised bed or solid cooler 3 connected to the combustion chamber 2. The ash 13 formed during the combustion mostly collects at the bottom of the combustion chamber 2 and the excess portion of the ash 13 is discharged from the combustion chamber 2 and carried away via the fluidised bed cooler 3. The ash 13 is discharged from the combustion chamber 2 via a cooler filling line 18 which connects the combustion chamber 2 to the cooler 3 via a solid inlet opening 15. Provided at the outlet from the combustion chamber 2 is an ash regulating valve 17 for regulating the discharged solid stream 13 into the cooler 3.<br>
Fluidised bed coolers 3 comprising one or more fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6 are used to cool the ash or the solid material 13, wherein Figure 2 shows a cooler with three fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6 as an example. For cooling the solid material 13 and for producing a fluidised bed 35 inside the chambers 4, 5, 6, fluidising gas 12, in most cases air, is introduced into the lower portion 10 of the cooler 3, whereby fluidising gas 12 is sprayed from below via a fluidising grid 20 and is distributed. The uniform distribution of the fluidising gas 12 is usually achieved by means of fluidising gas nozzles 21 which additionally prevent the solid material 13 from being<br><br>
able  to  enter  into  the  gas  or  air  chambers  22 underneath the fluidising gas base 20.<br>
The  solid material  13 entering into the cooler  3 through the inlet opening 15 enters into the first fluidised chamber 4, mixes with the solid material 13 already present therein and is cooled by the fluidising gas 12. Further cooling of the solid material 13 takes place in the fluidised chambers 5,  6 following the first chamber 4, wherein a solid partial flow 24, 25 enters into the following chambers 5, 6 as a result of the horizontal or transverse flow of the fluidised solid material 13 respectively at the baffles or weirs 7,8 partially separating the chambers 4, 5, 6. In order to  increase  or optimise the cooling of the  solid material  13,  the  chambers  4,  5,  6  can  contain additional bundles of heat exchanger tubes 23 by which means some of the heat can be removed from the solid material 13 and transferred to another heat transfer medium  (cooling water,  condensate,  feed water etc.) which is circulating in the heat exchanger tube bundle 23.  After  it  has  been  cooled  to  the  required temperature, most of the solid material 13 leaves the ash cooler 3 as a solid partial stream 26 via the outlet 16 having a wall or a weir 9 located upstream thereof.  Further solid draw-offs 27, 28,  29 can be provided at the bottom of the fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6. Particularly coarser solid particles are drawn off via these, these particles being unable to cross over the weirs 7, 8, 9 as a result of the horizontal flow of solid material 13 within the cooler 3 and their higher own weight compared to smaller solid particles.<br>
The solid material 13 to be cooled is usually composed of a particle grain spectrum between 0.05 mm up to a maximum of about 20 mm. In order to prevent larger solid particles from depositing on the fluidising<br><br>
nozzles 21, a minimum fluidising velocity is required by adjusting the supplied fluidising gas stream 12. The higher the coarse fraction of solid material 13, the higher the fluidising velocity must be selected. As the fluidising velocity of the fluidising gas 12 increases, fine solid particles are increasingly removed from the chambers 4, 5, 6 into the free board 11 above the cooler fluidised bed 35. These fluidising gas partial streams 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 containing fine solid particles mostly pass from the individual chambers 4, 5, 6 via one or more return pipes 19 back into the combustion chamber 1. If this fine solid material 13 returned to the combustion chamber 2 does not leave the combustion chamber 2 via a different route, it is carried into the ash cooler 3 again after some time where the same re-sifting process is repeated. As a result of this multiple recirculation of fine solid material 13 through the ash cooler 3, the draw-off capacity of the ash cooler 3 is reduced. In addition, the quantity of heat at the heat carrier medium circulating in the heat exchange tube bundle 23 is increased, this generally representing a loss.<br>
In order to largely avoid or reduce the re-sifting of fine-grained solid material 13 in the combustion chamber 2, one or more separators 30 are provided according to the invention in the free board 11 of the cooler 3. The separator 30 is preferably embodied as a inertia vane separator which substantially and as an example consists of a plurality of U-shaped profiles 31 and their U-profile opening 32 is substantially directed towards the fluidising gas stream 12 which is aligned substantially horizontally in the free board 11. Instead of the U-shaped profiles 31 shown as an example, V-shaped or W-shaped or open trapezoidal profiles 31 can also be used a inertia vane separators. The fluidising gas partial streams 12.1, 12.2, 12.3<br><br>
emerging from the respective chambers 4, 5, 6 and enriched with fine solid particles are passed towards the U-profiles 31 appropriately disposed upstream of the outlet opening 14 and the solid particles are thereby entrained into the inner or central area 32 of the U-profiles 31, whilst the fluidising gas partial streams 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 flow between the U-profiles 31. As a result of their own gravity inside the U-profile 31, the solid particles fall back into the fluidised bed 35 of the fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6. The length of the inertia vane separators or U-profiles 31 is determined so that the solid particles are entrained as far as in front of the fluidised bed 35 or even directly into the fluidised bed 35 of the respective chambers 4, 5, 6. As a result of the separation of solid material 13 by means of the separators 30 embodied as inertia vane separators and its return into the fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6, it is also possible for fine solid particles to leave the ash cooler 3 via the bottom draw-offs 27, 28, 29 or the outlet 16.<br>
The solid cooler 3 of the circulating fluidised bed reactor 1 according to the invention is preferably operated at a vertical fluidising velocity of the fluidising gas 12 in the fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6 between 0.2 m/s and 1.8 m/s and at a horizontal velocity of the fluidising gas 12 in the free board 11 between 1 m/s and 5 m/s.<br>
A positive side effect of the separation of return of fine ash or solid particles according to the invention is that the solid material inventory in the fluidised chambers 4, 5, 6 of the solid cooler 3 is hereby finer-grained. Since finer-grained material can be better fluidised, enrichment and the formation of deposits of coarse solid particles on the fluidising bottom 20 is prevented.<br><br>
i<br>
As shown in Figures 2 to 4, the separators 30 are usually arranged fixed, i.e. arranged or mounted stationarily inside the free board 11 of the cooler 3. The separators 30 can be arranged above the cooler fluidised bed 35 or a heat exchanger tube bundle 23 or above a baffle or a weir 7, 8. As shown in Figure 2, they can be arranged vertically or at an angle a, preferably at an angle a of +/- 60° to the vertical and, when viewed in the direction of flow of the fluidising gas 12, upstream of the gas-side cooler outlet opening 14.<br>
Figures  3 and 4  show two rows  36,  37 of fixedly arranged separators 30 in a longitudinal section and cross-section through the cooler 3. The U-profiles 31 of the separator 30 have a length L, a width B and a depth T. The U-profiles 31 of the respective rows 36, 37 are arranged adjacent to one another, separated from one another at a pitch distance tB, the distance tB preferably being 1.4 to 3.0 times the width B of the U-profile 31 to offer sufficient through cross-section for the fluidising gas partial streams 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 flowing in the direction of the outlet opening 14. The second or optionally other U-profile row 37 arranged behind the first U-profile row 36 seen in the direction of flow of the fluidising gas 12 is preferably located at a distance tT which is equal to 1.4 to 3.0 times the depth T of the U-profile 31 from the first row 36 or another  row.  In  order  to  increase  the  separating performance, the U-profiles 31 of the second or further rows 37 are staggered by half a pitch tB so that the U-profiles 31 of the second or another row 37 always come to lie centrally on the passage between the U-profiles 31 of the first or a preceding row 36. The length L of the U-profiles 31 can extend over the entire height HF of the free board 11 above the solid cooler fluidised<br><br>
bed 35. In order to achieve effective separation it is-advantageous if the length L of the U-profiles 31 is embodied as at least 0.4 times the free board height HF. Figures 3 to 10 each show two rows of U-profiles 36, 37 which are arranged substantially vertically to the fluidising gas stream and one behind the other seen in the direction of the fluidising gas stream.<br>
Figures 5 to 10 show possibilities for controlling the separating  performance  of  the  separator  30.  The separator 30 as shown in Figures 5 and 6 is constructed with a common turning device 33 by which means the two rows 36, 37 can be turned from the vertical at an angle P as far as almost horizontally. Figure 5 shows the separator 30 in the vertical position and at full separating  performance  whereas  in  Figure  6  the separator 30 has been brought from the vertical into an angular position (3 and thereby separates substantially less fine grain from the fluidising gas stream 12. Figures 7 and 8 show how the separating performance can be modified or regulated by vertical displacements of the separator 30 by means of a device 34 not shown in detail  for  vertical  or  horizontal  or  lateral displacement of the separator 30. Since the U-profiles 31 can be displaced or pushed out from the free board 11 by an amount V in the vertical direction, this can be effected downwards as shown in Figure 8 or upwards, the  separating  performance  can  be  modified  and regulated.  The  separating performance  can  also be modified   or   regulated  by   horizontal,   lateral displacement of the second or other U-profile rows 37 by means of a device 34 not shown for vertical or horizontal or lateral displacement of the separator 30, as shown in Figures 9 and 10. The largest reduction in the separating performance is obtained if, as shown in Figure 10,  the U-profiles 31 of the second row 37 overlap or are flush with those of the first row.<br><br>
Assuming that the U-profiles 31 are the same size	and<br>
the cooler cross-sectional width remains the same,	the<br>
U-profiles 31 of the second row 37 or other rows	are<br>
displaced laterally by half the pitch tB.<br>
Figure 11 shows an arrangement of the separator 30 where the separator rows 36, 37 of the U-profiles or trapezoidal profiles 31 open on one side are arranged concentrically to an outlet opening 14. The U-profiles 31 of the radially outer row 36 are staggered with respect to the U-profiles 31 of the radially inner row 37 as in the rows arranged one behind the other. By this means, effective separation of fine solid particles can be achieved before the fluidising gas stream 12 flows out from the cooler 3 whereby the fluidising gas stream 12 loaded with fine grain is largely purified from fine grain coming from any direction.<br>

substantially consists of a plurality of U-, or V-<br>
or W-profiles or trapezoidal profiles open on one<br>
side  (31)  and  its  profile  opening  (32)  is<br>
substantially directed towards the fluidising gas<br>
stream.<br>
3.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
claim 1 or claim 2,  characterised in that the<br>
separator (30) is embodied with at least one row<br>
(36,  37)  of profiles  (31)  open on one  side,<br>
wherein the profiles (31) of each row (36, 37) are arranged adjacent to one another and spaced apart from one another and the profile row(s) (36, 37) are arranged substantially perpendicular to the fluidising gas stream and if a plurality of rows (36, 37) are present, one behind the other seen in the direction of the fluidising gas stream.<br><br>
4.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
claim 3, characterised in that the profiles (31)<br>
of one row (36, 37) seen in the direction of flow<br>
of the fluidising gas stream are arranged so that<br>
they are each staggered with respect to a row (36,<br>
37) located upstream and/or downstream.<br>
5.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the<br>
length (L) of the profiles (31) is at least 0.4<br>
times the free-board height (HF) .<br>

8.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
one of the aforesaid claims, characterised in that<br>
the separating performance of the separator (30)<br>
can  be  regulated  by  lateral  displacement  of<br>
profiles (31) or rows (36, 37) with profiles (31).<br>
9.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
one of the aforesaid claims, characterised in that<br>
the separating performance of the separator (30)<br>
can be regulated by vertical displacement of the<br>
separator (30) , wherein this can be displaced into<br>
a region partly or completely outside the free<br>
board (11).<br><br>
10.	The circulating fluidised bed reactor according to<br>
one of the aforesaid claims, characterised in that<br>
the vertical fluidising velocity of the fluidising<br>
gas (12) in the chambers (4, 5, 6) is between 0.2<br>
m/s and 1.8 m/s and the horizontal velocity of the<br>
