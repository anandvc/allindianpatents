				<td>A CAPTIVE PRESSURE SENSOR STRUCTURE<br>
AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a captive pressure sensor structure and<br>
method of manufacturing.<br>
Traditionally, micromechanical pressure sensors are categorized in two classes<br>
according to their manufacturing method. A pressure sensor is categorized as a<br>
surface micromechanical sensor if it is manufactured using surface micromechanical<br>
techniques, while the term bulk micromechanical device is used if the fabrication of<br>
the sensor is based on the older bulk micromechanical technique.<br>
On the basis of their constructional differences, pressure sensors are also categorized<br>
in two classes depending on whether the sensor is responsive to a differential<br>
pressure or an absolute pressure. The present patent application discloses a novel<br>
construction for a surface micromechanical absolute pressure sensor and a method<br>
for manufacturing the same.<br>
Prior-art sensor structures are described, e.g., in publication K. Kasten et al.; Sensors<br>
and Actuators A, Vol. 85 (2000), pp. 147-152. In the sensor structure taught herein,<br>
the bottom electrode is formed from single-crystal silicon layer on a SIMOX<br>
substrate. The top electrode of the structure is made from polycrystalline silicon. The<br>
so-called sacrificial layer needed during fabrication is entirely removed via channels<br>
located at the edges of the electrodes. Next, the openings remaining from the etching<br>
of the sacrificial oxide layer during the manufacturing process are closed by<br>
depositing thereon silicon nitride using the PECVD process, whereby between the<br>
capacitive electrodes is formed a partial vacuum determined by the pressure of the<br>
PECVD process.<br>
The shortcomings of the structure proposed by Kasten are obvious. Since the sacrifi-<br>
cial layer is entirely etched away from the interior of the structure, a step discontinui-<br>
ty will remain on the flexible diaphragm at the edges of the sacrificial layer. Hence,<br>
the tensional stress of the flexible diaphragm must be controlled very low to prevent<br>
the inherent tensional stress of the diaphragm from bending it into contact to the<br>
bottom electrode. Resultingly, the capacitive elements must be made very small.<br>
Since a practicable sensor construction needs a capacitance in the order of 10 pF, a<br>
large number of capacitive elements is required. As a consequence, the relative<br>
proportion of the variable capacitance with regard to the overall capacitance remains<br>
low because of the element edge structures that in a large number of small elements<br>
increase the proportion of stray capacitance higher than what is achievable in such a<br>
sensor construction that facilitates the use of a larger capacitive element.<br>
Also the reference structure in the absolute pressure sensor construction proposed by<br>
Kasten is problematic. Therein, the stiffening of the reference element electrode is<br>
solved by way of leaving onto the reference elements a thick layer of oxide deposited<br>
in the LPCVD process. Since the thermal expansion constants of elemental silicon<br>
and its oxide are different from each other, this arrangement may be expected to<br>
impart a higher temperature dependence to the reference element structure. As a rule,<br>
the temperature/humidity dependencies of the sensing and reference structures,<br>
respectively, should be as equal as possible.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the problems of prior-art tech-<br>
niques and to provide an entirely novel type of absolute pressure sensor.<br>
The goal of the invention is achieved by way of using a porous polycrystalline<br>
silicon layer as a portion of the flexible diaphragm of the sensor structure.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a capacitive pressure sensor<br>
structure, in particular for measurement of absolute pressure, the sensor<br>
comprising:<br>
at least one fixed electrode, and<br>
at least one movable electrode electrically isolated from said fixed<br>
electrode and spaced apart from said fixed electrode,<br>
characterized in that<br>
a portion of said movable electrode is formed from a porous<br>
polycrystalline silicon layer that in a finished component remains as an integral<br>
portion of said flexibly movable electrode.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a<br>
capacitive pressure structure, in particular a sensor for measurement of<br>
absolute pressure, the sensor comprising :<br>
at least one fixed electrode, and<br>
at least one movable electrode electrically isolated from said fixed<br>
electrode and spaced apart from said fixed electrode,<br>
characterized in that<br>
a portion of said movable electrode is formed from a porous<br>
polycrystalline silicon layer that in a finished component remains as an integral<br>
portion of said flexibly movable electrode.<br>
The invention offers significant benefits.<br>
The invention makes it possible to implement pressure sensors covering needs from<br>
the barometric range up to pressures in the order of hundreds of bars. The size of<br>
individual capacitive elements is sufficiently larger even at barometric pressures to<br>
keep the relative proportion of stray capacitances reasonably low. The area of the<br>
sacrificial layer to be etched away can be defined by lithography techniques,<br>
whereby the manufacturing tolerances are improved. A portion of the oxide acting as<br>
the sacrificial layer can be left unetched. As a consequence, the flexible diaphragm<br>
retains a straight shape at its edges. Resultingly, the internal tensional stress of the<br>
diaphragm can be adjusted high thus facilitating the use of a larger element size. The<br>
reference structure according to the invention is responsive to changes in ambient<br>
temperature and, e.g., humidity in the same manner as the pressure-responsive<br>
structure proper. Hence, the overall construction of the sensor can be made very<br>
stable and secondary factors causing extra temperature drift and dependence on<br>
ambient humidity can be readily compensated for.<br>
In the following, the invention will be examined in greater detail with the help of<br>
exemplifying embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a sensor element according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a top view of a capacitive pressure sensor comprised of elements (25 pcs.)<br>
shown in FIG. 1;<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a reference sensor element according to the<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 4 is a top view of the reference element area of a capacitive pressure sensor<br>
according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic top view of a complete capacitive pressure sensor according to<br>
the invention;<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment of a sensor element<br>
according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a second embodiment of a sensor element<br>
according to the invention; and<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic list of manufacturing steps in the fabrication method of a<br>
sensor according to the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a sensor element of an absolute pressure sensor according to the<br>
invention comprises a polycrystalline silicon layer 3 which is deposited on a<br>
dielectric layer 2 made on a silicon substrate 1, is doped conductive and has another<br>
dielectric layer 4 deposited thereon. Over these layers is deposited a polycrystalline<br>
silicon layer 5 having thereon deposited a polycrystalline silicon layer 6 containing<br>
small-diameter pore holes in abundance. Layer 5 is optional in the overall structure.<br>
It may be omitted if the definition of the sacrificial layer takes place by lithography<br>
technique after the deposition of the porous silicon layer. Layer 5 may also extend<br>
into the region above area 10. Then, the layer has one or more openings permitting<br>
layer 6 to communicate with area 10. Above the porous silicon layer is again<br>
deposited a uniform silicon layer 7 that serves as a substrate for metallization layer 8.<br>
Dielectric layer 4 and polycrystalline silicon layer 5 are removed from the center and<br>
edge areas of the capacitive element. At the edge area of the element, a metallization<br>
layer 9 is deposited onto the conductive polycrystalline silicon layer. With the<br>
exception of the contact areas and the flexible diaphragm, area 10 of the sensor<br>
structure is covered by a passivation layer 11.<br>
Dielectric layer 2 is most advantageously silicon dioxide with a thickness of 500 -<br>
2000 nm typical. Polycrystalline silicon layer 3 is made conductive by doping with<br>
phosphorus or boron, for instance. Layer 4 is made of a dielectric material, most<br>
advantageously silicon dioxide. Layer 5 is most advantageously made of doped<br>
polycrystalline silicon. Layer 6 is a porous, doped polycrystalline silicon layer<br>
having a thickness of about 100 ran. The conductive polycrystalline silicon layer 7<br>
deposited on layer 6 is typically 100 nm to 5000 nm thick. In combination with the<br>
internal tensional stress of the capacitive element, the thickness of layer 7 plays a<br>
crucial role in the dimensioning of the sensor element. An example on the deposition<br>
technique of the porous silicon layer (with a high density of holes) is described, e.g.,<br>
in publication Y. Kageyama, T. Tsuchiya, H. Fuanbashi, and J. Sakata:<br>
"Polycrystalline silicon thin films with hydrofluoric acid permeability for underlying<br>
oxide etching and vacuum encapsulation" J. Vac. Sci Technol. A 18(4), Jul/Aug<br>
2000. An essential factor in the structure of layer 6 is that its pores are very small<br>
(with an average minimum diameter of less than 10 nm).<br>
The metallization layers 8 and 9 make an electrical contact to layers 3 and 7. Most<br>
advantageously, metallization layers 8 and 9 are made by sputtering a 1000 run thick<br>
aluminum layer. The sensor cavity defined by area 10 in the center region of the<br>
structure is at a partial vacuum. The deflection of layers 6 and 7 is determined by the<br>
differential pressure between the cavity area 10 and the ambient pressure. The shape<br>
and size of area 10, in combination with the thickness and tensile stress of layers 6<br>
and 7, determine the usable pressure range of the sensor<br>
Passivation layer 11 that forms the uppermost layer of the structure is most advan-<br>
tageously made of silicon nitride or using a multilayer structure of silicon nitride and<br>
silicon dioxide. Typically, passivation layer 11 is about 500 nm thick.<br>
In the pressure sensor embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the bottom electrodes of all the<br>
capacitive sensor elements are connected in parallel at a contact area located in the<br>
right lower edge of the sensor. Respectively, all the top electrodes are connected by<br>
the metallization layer at a contact area located in the left upper edge of the sensor.<br>
Hence, the capacitance between the bottom electrode contact and the top electrode<br>
contact is the overall capacitance of all the capacitive elements whose value is<br>
dependent on the differential pressure between the ambient pressure-transmitting<br>
medium and the internal volume of the sensor taken to a partial vacuum. Resultingly,<br>
a measurement of the overall capacitance is sufficient to determine the ambient<br>
pressure on the basis of the sensor calibration data.<br>
In addition to the variable capacitance of the active area, the overall capacitance<br>
measurable across a sensor invariably includes an inherent capacitance of the sensor<br>
structure known as the stray capacitance. As a rule, the value of stray capacitance<br>
measured over a sensor structure is dependent on the component temperature and,<br>
e.g., ambient humidity. Since it is generally impossible to arrange a measurement<br>
over a single component such that the portion of the variable capacitance is detected<br>
separately from the stray capacitance, it is advantageous to integrate on the same<br>
silicon chip also a separate structure that can be used for eliminating the contribution<br>
of stray capacitances on the measured value of pressure. Such a reference structure of<br>
non-pressure-responsive capacitance is most preferably constructed as identical as<br>
possible to the pressure-responsive measuring sensor as to its capacitance<br>
dependence on ambient parameters (e.g., temperature and humidity).<br>
To a person versed in the art it is obvious that the reference capacitance may also be<br>
constructed on a separate silicon chip, whereby the integration of a pressure sensor<br>
with a complete reference can be implemented using a suitable packaging<br>
technology.<br>
In FIG. 3 is shown a cross-sectional view of the structure of a reference element<br>
according to the invention. As is evident from the diagram, the sacrificial layer<br>
contains within area 10 a number of column pads 14 formed by layers 4 and 5. The<br>
purpose of the pads is to stiffen the top electrode so as to eliminate the pressure<br>
responsiveness of the reference sensor capacitance. Typically, the circular column<br>
pads needed in the structure have a diameter of 10mm to 10 mm. The number of pads<br>
serving to stiffen the top electrode formed by layers 6 and 7 (thereby reducing its<br>
pressure responsiveness) may be varied from 1 to 100 per capacitive element. As to<br>
the dimensioning of the sensor, it is essential that the overall area of column pads<br>
formed on area 10 of a single capacitive element of the reference sensor is substan-<br>
tially smaller than the overall area of the sensor element, whereby the element of the<br>
reference sensor is as identical as possible to the corresponding element of the actual<br>
pressure-responsive sensor except for its non-responsiveness to pressure variations.<br>
Other techniques for reducing the responsiveness of the reference sensor to pressure<br>
can be found through increasing the thickness of layer 6 as well as from increasing<br>
the internal tensional stress of layers 6 and 7 in regard to that of the actual pressure-<br>
responsive elements.<br>
In FIG. 4 is shown a top view of the reference area of a pressure sensor. The<br>
reference elements shown in the diagram have 16 supporting column pads over the<br>
area 10 of the sacrificial layer etched away placed so as to stiffen the diaphragm<br>
formed by layers 6 and 7.<br>
To a person versed in the art it is obvious that the structure may be complemented by<br>
placing between the top and bottom electrodes an additional electrode known as a<br>
guard electrode that may be used, e.g., for eliminating measurement errors caused by<br>
surface leakage currents. Respectively, a person versed in the art is fully aware that<br>
the lowermost polycrystalline silicon layer (bottom electrode) 3 and the dielectric<br>
layer 2 may be omitted from the structure if it is desirable to use the silicon substrate<br>
alone as the bottom electrode.<br>
ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENT OF THE STRUCTURE<br>
The relative proportion of the pressure-responsive capacitance in regard to the over-<br>
all capacitance may be increased by making the elements thicker at their center areas.<br>
Thus, the layer subject to flexure under an external pressure flexes in the structure<br>
more at its edges than at its central area. As the central area remains at any pressure<br>
essentially flat over the entire span of pressure measurement, the proportion of the<br>
pressure-responsive capacitance in regard to the overall capacitance is resultingly<br>
increased. In a practicable realization of the sensor, the thicker portion 12 shown in<br>
FIG. 6 is most preferably made from polycrystalline silicon (analogously to layer 7).<br>
The thicker area of the flexible diaphragm may also be made prior to the deposition<br>
of the porous polycrystalline silicon layer. However, the area must then be patterned<br>
with openings to achieve efficient etching-away of the sacrificial layer thereunder.<br>
The basic structure (FIG. 3) may also be improved by extending layer 5 over the<br>
entire area of the flexible diaphragm. In FIG. 7 is shown a cross-sectional view of<br>
such a variant of the structure. In this construction, the stiffness of the diaphragm is<br>
improved by a layer 5 that most preferably is of the same material as layer 7 (that is,<br>
polycrystalline silicon). For proper etching-away the sacrificial layer in this embodi-<br>
ment of the sensor structure, layer 5 must be provided with one or more openings 13.<br>
As an alternative embodiment of the sensor construction may also be interpreted<br>
such a structure wherein the lowermost polycrystalline silicon layer (bottom<br>
electrode) 3 and dielectric layer 2 are omitted. Then the bottom electrode may be<br>
formed by the silicon substrate 1 that is doped conductive.<br>
DIMENSIONING OF THE SENSOR<br>
The sensor can be dimensioned (as to the layer thicknesses, geometry and tensional<br>
stresses) using commercially available FEM software. In the simplest case using<br>
circular areas as the flexible portions of the sensor elements, the dimensioning<br>
thereof can be performed with the help of the analytical tools [3] written below.<br>
Flexure of a circular diaphragm (drum diaphragm):<br>
where p = pressure<br>
R = radius of etched-free diaphragm area<br>
s = tensional stress of diaphragm<br>
h = thickness of flexible diaphragm<br>
r = distance from diaphragm center point<br>
Example: p= 1. 105Pa<br>
h=1mm (thickness of flexible polycrystalline silicon layer)<br>
s (at 3000 ppm strain) = 0.03• 160• 109 Pa (tensional stress of<br>
diaphragm after thermal treatment of polycrystalline silicon<br>
diaphragm at 700 °C, 1 h);<br>
equation solving as Z(0) = 0.5 µm when R= 98µm (whereby<br>
deflection of the diaphragm is half the sensor air gap at a pressure of<br>
1 • 105 Pa and sacrificial layer thickness du of 1 µm).<br>
With the values of the example, about 25 elements fit on 1 mm2.<br>
Overall capacitance of sensor (having N elements) as a function of pressure:<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the method comprises the following steps in order of execution:<br>
1. Oxide layer growth<br>
2. Amorphous silicon layer growth (complemented with, e.g., in situ doping with<br>
boron)<br>
3. Thermal treatment<br>
4. Patterning of polycrystalline silicon layer<br>
5. Deposition of sacrificial layer (LTO)<br>
6. Amorphous silicon layer growth (complemented with, e.g., in situ doping with<br>
boron)<br>
7. Amorphous silicon layer patterning<br>
8. Amorphous silicon layer growth (doping with boron, made porous/with openings,<br>
thickness 100 nm)<br>
9. Thermal treatment<br>
10. Sacrificial layer etching<br>
11. Polycrystalline silicon layer growth (complemented with, e.g., in situ doping with<br>
boron)<br>
12. Polycrystalline silicon layer patterning<br>
13. LTO layer patterning<br>
14. Metallization layer deposition<br>
15. Metallization layer patterning<br>
16. PECVD growth of silicon nitride layer<br>
17. Patterning of PECVD grown silicon nitride layer.<br>
As a rule, porous layer 6 must understood as a layer pervious to etching chemicals<br>
but impervious to the materials of layer 7 that is subsequently deposited thereon.<br>

16. The method as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 15, wherein the<br>
sensor structure constitutes a plurality of single sensor elements connected in<br>
parallel or series with each other.<br>
17. The method as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 16, wherein the<br>
sensor structure is manufactured using silicon micromechanical techniques.<br>
18. The method as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 17, wherein the solid<br>
material (4) (of the sacrificial layer) from the interior of the cavity that in a<br>
finished sensor is taken to a partial vacuum is removed via a porous<br>
polycrystalline silicon layer (6).<br>
19. The method as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 18, wherein the<br>
sealing of a sensor element is carried out by deposing onto said porous<br>
polycrystalline silicon layer another polycrystalline silicon layer in a process that<br>
leaves the partial vacuum of said deposition process into the interior of the<br>
sensor element.<br>
The present publication discloses a captive pressure sensor structure, in<br>
particular for measurement of absolute pressure, and a method for<br>
manufacturing the sensor. The sensor comprises at least one fixed electrode (3),<br>
and at least one movable electrode (6, 7) electrically isolated from said fixed<br>
electrode (3) and spaced apart (10) from said fixed electrode (3). According to<br>
the invention, a portion of said movable electrode (6, 7) is formed from a porous<br>
polycrystalline silicon layer (6) that in a finished component remains as an<br>
integral portion of said flexibly movable electrode (6, 7).</td>
