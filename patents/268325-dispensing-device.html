				<td>DISPENSING DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is directed to a dispensing device and, in particular, to' a dispensing device for separately storing, dispensing and applying proportional amounts of two substances. The invention has been developed primarily for dispensing glue or adhesive in the form of an epoxy and a hardener and will be described with reference to this application. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular field of use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many devices are known which are useful for dispensing proportional amounts of two materials, typically epoxy and hardeners, kept sqiarately prior to dispensing. Commonly, prior art devices comprise two collapsible tubes along with a means for holding the two tubes together. While the use of two tubes held together to dispense an epoxy and a hardener would appear to be effective, there are certain disadvantages. The use of a common sleeve or yoke to hold the devices together can interfere with the evacuation of the tubes. In addition, it is difficult to ensure that the proportional amounts of the substances within the lubes are dispensed. This is particularly the case when dispensing small amounts of the substances. Prior art devices are commonly provided for larger scale applications, meaning the aibes or containers holding the epoxy and hardener must be resealed after use. As a result blockage of the tube or dispensing device is common. This can render the glue unusable or difficult to apply in a consistent manner. There is therefore a need for a device for separating and dispensing epoxy and hardeners in a single use pack.<br>
The device generally requires two hands for dispensing the contents.   The distance between the nozzles of thetwo tubes can make proper mixing of the two substances difficult.<br>
Prior art devices also include more complicated dispensing systems utilising ah- pressure or a displacement pump to remove epoxy and hardener from separate chambers. Wlu'le many of these systems arc effective, these mnchines are not intended for use in small applications and require significant outlay of money and investment of space and time.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a dispensing device which will overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of the deficiencies of the prior art, or to at least provide an alternative.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference; to the u^eoinprmying figure in which:<br>
FIG 1   is a plan vusv of a dispensing device in accordance with a prefeircd embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG 2  is tin elevation view of the dispensing device shown in Kg. 1. FIG 3  is  a  perspective view of the dispensing device of Fig.  1  in a partially  folded<br>
configuration. FIG 4  is a perspective view of the dispensing device 1 of Fig 1, in a folded configuration and<br>
turn open. FIG 5  is a perspective view of the dispensing device as a user squeezes it.<br>
BKST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referral"to Figs. 1 -- 5, there is shown an embodiment of a dispensing device for separately storing two substances in accordance with the present invention. The device is adapted to dispense, mix and.applv proportional amounts of the substances. The dispensing device 1 comprises a Mib-qnruially flat thin flexible web 2. The web 2 includes a longitudinal axis 3 which is preferably scored or vacuum formed lo enable a user to easily fold the dispensing device 1 about longitudinal axis 3.<br>
Two ivcepiacli:   2nd 4' are disposed about longitudinal axis 3. The receptacles 4 and 4' are disposed.such then- receptacle 4 on one side of the longitudinal axis 3 is a transposed mirror image of the of the  4' on the other side of the lomutudmal axis 3.<br>
The receptacles 4 and 4' each include an outlet 5. The outlet 5 is noxxJe shaped to allow a substance contained within the receptacle 4 to be easily evacuated from the receptacle 4. The outlet 5 is positioned on or adjacent the side edge of the web 2, distal from I he longitudinal axis 3. It can be seen that when folded, the receptacle 4 on one side of the longitudinal axis 3 is substantially aligned with the receptacle 4' on the oilier side of the longitudinal axis 3.<br>
The web 2 and receptacles 4 and 4' may be integral to one another or may be composed of separate materials and sealed or otherwise affixed to one another. The materials are flexible to allow a substance contained within receptacle 4 to be squeezed through outlet 5. The web may be composed of foil or polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate or foil coated with one of the plastics, specifically polypropylene. The receptacles 4 and 4' may similarly be coimwscd of a foil or polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate or foil coaled with on of the plastics, specifically polypropylene. The web 2 and receptacles 4 and 4' may comprise one or more laminae. The laminae may be composed of foil or polyeth3'lene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate or foil coated with on of the plastics, specifically polypropylene or each lamina may be composed of a separate material. The laminae are then scaled together to form the receptacles 4 and 4'.<br>
The receptacles 4 and 4' further include indicia or markings 6 to indicate where a user is to place his or her thumb and forefinger in order to evacuate a substance contained within receptacles 4 and 4' through outlet 5. The indicia 6 can be incorporated into the shape of the receptacles 4 and 4' or can be painted or printed thereon. It can be seen that, these, indicia 6 allow for  substantially complete evacuation of receptacle 4 through outlet 5. Moreover, it can be seen that the indicia 6 allow for easy one-handed use of the dispensing device 1.<br>
Outlet 5 may include a weakened point or region (not illustrated). In usu the substances contained within the two receptacles 4 and 4' will burst through '.he weakened region upon user squcczing receptacle 4. Alternately, web . and outlet 5 can incorporate a scored or vacuum formed tear line 7. Tear lino 7 may he double die-cut. The luar line 7 leads through the weakest point of outlet 5. It can be seen in Figs. 4 and 5 that upon a user cutting or tearing<br>
along tear lino 7. the seal on oullct 5 would be opened allowing the substances contained within the receptacles 4 to be evacuated by squeezing.<br>
The substances contained within the two receptacles 4 and 4' in this embodiment may be an epoxy and a hardener, however any preferred substances can be used. In use it is important that proportional amounts of these substances be applied to a surface (not illustrated). In use the epoxy and hardener can be in the proportions 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:100 or any suitable proportions. The receptacles 4 and 4' can be molded to any predetermined size. When the receptacles 4 and 4' are of differing sizes the outlets 5 are still substantially aligned. It can be seen that in the present invention the proportion of the substances used is defined by the size of the receptacles 4.<br>
in other embodiments the substances contained within the two receptacles 4 and 4' may be foodstuffs, pharmacculieals, medical or dental products, beauty aids or any liquid, paste or gel substances designed for separate storage and simultaneous application. In use the receptacles 4 and 4' may be independently evacuated such that one or other of the two substances contained<br>
therein is dispensed.<br>
The dispensing device 1 is designed to be used once and then disposed of. The dispensing device 1 can be sold in single application packs which comprise two receptacles 4 or in multiple application packs (not illustrated) where each pair of receptacles 4 corresponds to one application.<br>
The dispensing device 1 may preferably have dimensions of approximately 60mm by 45 mm. The  receplaelcs  and 4' may preferably be approximately 7.5 mm in radius at their base (not illustraned) and approximately 5mm in radius at their top (not illustrated). The outlets 5 may prdferably     taper toan end approximately 15 mm from the centre of the receptacles 4 and 4'. In this case   the receptales     4 and 4' contain between approximately 1 nil and approximately 5 ml of substances. Howere the receptacles 4 and 4' can be molded to contain any prcicrable volume of  substances  and may contain different amounts from one another.<br>
The dispensing device 1 is adapted to be folded and manipulated by a user in a one-handed operation such that the outlets 5 are easily aligned and the substances contained within receptacles 4 and 41 arc simultaneously dispensed, mixed and proportionately applied to a surface, in use the receptacles A and 4' extend outwardly once  folded. hi use the 11 at edges K of outlets 5 assist in mixing the two substances when they conic into contact after application to the surface (not illustrated).<br>
The foregoing describes only a preferred embodiment of the present invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the art, may be made thereto without deparling from the scope of the present invention.<br>
