Applicant: JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V. having its principal place of business at Turnhoutseweg 30, 2340 Beerse, Belgium<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to<br>
be performed:-<br><br><br>
WO 2008/090200<br><br><br><br>
PCT/EF2008/050818<br><br>
2- PIPERAZIN-l-YL-3H-IMIDAZO[4,5-B]PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel compounds of formula (I) having fundic 5      relaxating activity. The invention further relates to methods for preparing such<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as well as the use as a medicine of said compounds.<br>
EP-A-0,079,545 discloses piperazinyl substituted benzimidazole derivatives with 10     antihistaminic acitivity. EP-0,397,613 discloses aminoimidazopyridines having antihistaminic activity and EP-0,512,939 discloses 2-piperazinylbenzimidazole derivatives as antagonists of serotonin 5HT3 receptors. EP-1,250,337 discloses substituted homopiperidinyl benzimidazole analogues as fundic relaxants.<br>
1.5      The present invention concerns compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
including any stereochemically isomeric form thereof, 20      wherein<br>
R1  is hydrogen, phenylmethyl, pyridinylmethyl or benzo[l,3]dioxolylmethyl;<br>
R2 isC1-4alkyl;<br>
R3  is hydrogen, halo or Cmalkyl;<br>
R4  is hydrogen, halo or C1-4alkyl; and 25      R5  is hydrogen, amino, C1-4alkylamino or di(C1-4alkyl)amino;<br>
or a pharmaceuticaly acceptable acid addition salt thereof, or a solvate thereof.<br>
As used in the foregoing definitions : - halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo; 30      - C1-4alkyl defines straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methyl-ethyl, 2-methylpropyl and the like.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the 35      possible isomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I) may possess. Unless<br><br>
WO 2008/090200	n	PCT/EP2008/050818<br>
otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic 5      (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
The absolute stereochemical configuration of the compounds of formula (I) and of the 10     intermediates used in their preparation may easily be determined by those skilled in the art while using well-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br>
Furthermore, some compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates used in their preparation may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present 15      invention encompasses any polymorphic forms possessing properties useful in the treatment of the conditions noted hereinabove.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms that the<br>
20      compounds of formula (I) are able to form. These pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic,<br>
25      lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,/?-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, /^-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
30      Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular association comprising a 3 5      compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent<br>
molecules, e.g. water or ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is used when said solvent is water.<br><br>
WO 2008/090200<br><br>

PCT/EP2008/050818<br><br>
Interesting compounds of formula (I) are those compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more of the following restrictions apply :<br>
a)	R1 is phenylmethyl; or<br>
b)	R1 is pyridinylmethyl; or 5      c) R1 is hydrogen; or<br><br>
d)	R2 is methyl; or<br>
e)	R3, R4 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can in general be prepared by TV-alkylating an intermediate 10      of formula (II) with an intermediate of formula (III).<br><br>
In formula (III) and hereinafter W represents an appropriate leaving group such as, for<br>
15      example, halo, e.g. chloro, bromo and the like; or a sulfonyloxy group such as, for example, methanesulfonyloxy, 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy and the like. Said N-alkylation reaction can conveniently be conducted in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g., benzene, methylbenzene, dimethylbenzene and the like; an alkanol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol and the<br>
20     like; a ketone, e.g., 2-propanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone and the like; an ether, e.g., tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, l,r-oxybisethane and the like; a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide, N.N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, nitro¬benzene, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and the like; or a mixture of such solvents. The addition of an appropriate base such as, for example, an alkali or an earth alkaline metal<br>
25      carbonate, hydrogen carbonate, alkoxide, hydride, amide, hydroxide or oxide, e.g., sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium tert. butoxide, sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide and the like; or an organic base, such as, for example, an amine, e.g., N,N-diethylethanamine,<br>
30     N-( 1 -methylethyl)-2-propanamine, 4-ethylmorpholine, pyridine and the like may be<br>
utilized to pick up the acid which is liberated during the course of the reaction. In some instances the addition of an iodide salt, preferably an alkali metal iodide, is appropriate. Somewhat elevated temperatures and stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. Alternatively, said N,-alkylation may be carried out by applying art-known conditions<br>
35      of phase transfer catalysis reactions.<br><br>
WO 2008/090200	r	PCT/EP2008/050818<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by yN-alkylating a compound of formula (I-a) with an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein R1' is defined as radical R1 other than hydrogen.<br><br>
In formula (IV) and hereinafter W represents an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, halo, e.g. chloro, bromo and the like; or a sulfonyloxy group such as, for 10      example, methanesulfonyloxy, 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy and the like. Said N-alkylation reaction can conveniently be conducted as described above.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-a), defined as compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents hydrogen, can be prepared by hydrogenating compounds of formula (I-b), 15      defined as compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents phenylmethyl, in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br><br>
20     Intermediates of formula (III) are known such as 2-chloro-3-ethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Bollettino Chimico Farmaceutico (1970), 109, (11), 665-73), or are prepared as set out in the Examples A.l, A.2, A3, A.4, A.5 and A.6.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may 25      be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. Those compounds of formula (I) that are obtained in racemic form may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional 30      crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves<br><br>
WO 2008/090200		PCT/EP2008/050818<br>
liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will 5      be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
In view of the capability of the compounds of the present invention to relax the fundus as demonstrated in Pharmacological Example C.l, the subject compounds are useful to 10     treat conditions related to a hampered or impaired relaxation of the fundus such as, e.g. gastro-oesophageal reflux, heartburn (including episodic heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, and meal-induced heartburn), dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating and anorexia.<br>
Dyspepsia may be caused by delayed gastric emptying, by impaired relaxation of the 15      fundus to food ingestion or by hypersensitivity to gastric relaxation. Dyspeptic<br>
symptoms are for example a lack of appetite, feeling of fullness, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, bloating and gaseous eructation.<br>
Warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering 20      from dyspeptic symptoms as a result of delayed gastric emptying usually have a normal fundic relaxation and can be relieved of their dyspeptic symptoms by administering a prokinetic agent such as, e.g. cisapride.<br>
Patients can have dyspeptic symptoms without having a disturbed gastric emptying. 25      Their dyspeptic symptoms may result from a hypercontracted fundus resulting in a diminished compliance and abnormalities in the adaptive fundic relaxation. Also dyspeptic symptoms may arise from hypersensitivity of the fundus to relaxation.<br>
A hypercontracted fundus results in a diminished compliance of the stomach. The<br>
30      "compliance of the stomach" can be expressed as the ratio of the volume of the stomach<br>
over the pressure exerted by the stomach wall. The compliance of the stomach relates<br>
to the gastric tone, which is the result of the tonic contraction of muscle fibers of the<br>
proximal stomach. This proximal part of the stomach, by exerting a regulated tonic<br>
contraction (gastric tone), accomplishes the reservoir function of the stomach. 35<br>
Patients suffering from early satiety cannot finish a normal meal since they feel<br>
saturated before they are able to finish said normal meal. Normally when a subject<br>
starts eating, the stomach will show an adaptive relaxation, i.e. the stomach will relax<br><br><br>
WO 2008/090200	PCT/EP2008/050818<br>
to accept the food that is ingested, This adaptive relaxation is not possible when the compliance of the stomach is hampered which results in an impaired relaxation of the fundus.<br>
5      In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), it follows that the present<br>
invention also provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from impaired relaxation of the fundus to food ingestion. Consequently a method of treatment is provided for relieving patients suffering from conditions, such as, for example, gastro-oesophageal reflux, heartburn 10      (including episodic heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, and meal-induced heartburn), dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating and anorexia.<br>
Hence, the use of a compound of formula (I) as medicine is provided, and in particular the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicine for treating 15      conditions involving an impaired relaxation of the fundus to food ingestion such as e.g. gastro-oesophageal reflux, heartburn (including episodic heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, and meal-induced heartburn), dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating and anorexia. Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment are envisaged.<br>
20     The symptoms of impaired fundic relaxation may also arise due to the intake of<br>
chemical substances, e.g. Selective Seretonine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRI's), such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, sertraline; or erythromycin and erythromycin alike antibiotic macrolides such as, e.g. EM-523, EM-574, ABT-229, GM-611, (8^)-4"-deoxy-6,9-epoxyerythromycin A, (8S)-4*'-deoxy-6,9-<br>
25      epoxyerythromycin A, A-81648, A-173508, A-182061, and KC-11458.<br>
Another functional gastrointestinal disorder is irritable bowel syndrome whereby one of its features is believed to be related to hypersensitivity of the gut to distension. Hence it is therefore believed that modulation of said hypersensitivity by the compounds of the 30     present invention having fundus relaxation properties may result in a reduction of the symptoms in subjects suffering from IBS. Accordingly the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicine for treating IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is provided. Furthermore the compounds of formula (I) are also able to<br>
reduce the pain associated with gastrointestinal hypersensitivity. 35<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which<br><br><br>
WO 2008/090200<br><br>
-8-<br><br>
PCT/EP2008/050818<br><br>
carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual 5      pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches,, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
10      advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included- Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and<br>
15      glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause<br>
20      a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the<br>
administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the<br>
25      preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically<br>
30      discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and<br>
35      segregated multiples thereof.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/090200<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
PCT/EP2008/050818<br><br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of solid<br>
dose forms, for example, tablets (both swallowable-only and chewable forms), capsules<br>
or gelcaps, prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch,<br>
5      polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate,<br>
talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting<br>
agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known<br>
in the art. 10<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means, optionally widi pharmaceutically acceptable 15      additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propyl methylcellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
20      Pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners comprise preferably at least one intense sweetener such as saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sodium cyclamate, alitame, a dihydrochalcone sweetener, monellin, stevioside or sucralose (4,l\6'-trichloro-4,r,6'-trideoxyga/actosucrose), preferably saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, and optionally a bulk sweetener such as<br>
25      sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, isomalt, glucose, hydrogenated glucose syrup, xylitol, caramel or honey.<br>
Intense sweeteners are conveniently employed in low concentrations. For example, in the case of sodium saccharin, the concentration may range from 0.04% to 0.1% (w/v) 30     based on the total volume of the final formulation, and preferably is about 0.06% in the low-dosage formulations and about 0.08% in the high-dosage ones. The bulk sweetener can effectively be used in larger quantities ranging from about 10% to about 35%, preferably from about 10% to 15% (w/v).<br>
35      The pharmaceutically acceptable flavours which can mask the bitter tasting ingredients in the low-dosage formulations are preferably fruit flavours such as cherry, raspberry, black currant or strawberry flavour. A combination of two flavours may yield very good results. In the high-dosage formulations stronger flavours may be required such<br><br><br>
WO 2008/090200	PCT/EP2008/050818<br>
as Caramel Chocolate flavour, Mint Cool flavour, Fantasy flavour and the like pharmaceuticaly acceptable strong flavours. Each flavour may be present in the final composition in a concentration ranging from 0.05% to 1% (w/v). Combinations of said strong flavours are advantageously used. Preferably a flavour is used that does not 5      undergo any change or loss of taste and colour under the acidic conditions of the formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, conveniently intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, for<br>
10      example by bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain forrnulatory agents such as isotonizing, suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing<br>
15      agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such 20      as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of conditions related to a hampered or impaired relaxation of the fundus could easily determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that a therapeutically<br>
25      effective dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.01 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose as two, three, four OT more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.1 mg to 350 mg, and in particular 1 to 200 mg of active<br>
30      ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as 35      well as other medication the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.<br><br><br>

C. Pharmacological examples<br>
C.l. Gastric tone measured by an electronic barostat in conscious dogs Gastric tone cannot be measured by manometric methods. Therefore an electronic 5      barostat was used. This allows the study of the physiological pattern and regulation of gastric tone in conscious dogs and the influence of test-compounds on this tone.<br>
The barostat consists of an air injection system which is connected by a double-lumen<br>
14-French polyvinyl tube to an ultrathin flaccid polyethylene bag (maximal volume:<br>
10     ± 700 ml). Variations in gastric tone were measured by recording changes in the<br>
volume of air within an intragastric bag, maintained at a constant pressure. The<br>
barostat maintains a constant pressure (preselected) within a flaccid air-filled bag<br>
introduced into the stomach, changing the volume of air within the bag by an electronic<br>
feedback system. 15<br>
Thus, the barostat measures gastric motor activity (contraction or relaxation) as<br>
changes in intragastric volume (decrease or increase resp.) at a constant intragastric<br>
pressure. The barostat consists of a strain gauge linked by an electronic relay to an air<br><br>

connected by means of double-lumen polyvinyl tube to an ultrathin polyethylene bag.<br>
A dial in the barostat allows selection of the pressure level to be maintained within the<br>
intragastric bag. 5<br>
Female beagle dogs, weighing 7-17 kg, were trained to stand quietly in Pavlov frames.<br>
They were implanted with a gastric cannula under general anaesthesia and aseptic<br>
precautions. After a median laparotomy, an incision was made through the gastric wall<br>
in longitudinal direction between the greater and the lesser curve, 2 cm above the<br>
10     nerves of Latarjet. The cannula was secured to the gastric wall by means of a double<br>
purse string suture and brought out via a stub wound at the left quadrant of the<br>
hypochondrium. Dogs were allowed a recovery period of two weeks.<br>
At the beginning of the experiment, the cannula was opened in order to remove any 15      gastric juice or food remnants. If necessary, the stomach was cleansed with 40 to 50 ml lukewarm water. The ultrathin bag of the barostat was positioned into the fundus of the stomach through the gastric cannula. In order to ensure easy unfolding of the intragastric bag during the experiment, a volume of 150-200 ml was injected into the bag by raising the pressure to maximally 14 mm Hg (about 1.87 kPa) very briefly. This 20     procedure was repeated twice.<br>
After a stabilization period of 60 minutes at an intragastric pressure of 6 mmHg (about 0.81 kPa), the test compound was administered subcutaneously, or intraduodenally, at 2 mmHg (0.27 kPa). Test compounds were screened, i.e. changes in gastric volume 25      are measured, at 0.63 mg/kg s.c. Other doses and routes were tested if a test compound was shown to be active during the screening procedure. Table C-l summarizes the mean maximal change in volume (in ml) on relaxation of the fundus, 1 hour after ID. administration of the test compound (0.63 mg/kg).<br>
