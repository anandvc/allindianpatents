				<td>A MODULATION TECHNIQUE PROVIDING HIGH DATA RATE THROUGH BAND<br>
LIMITED CHANNELS<br>
The present invention relates to a modulation technique which provides a high<br>
data rate through band limited channels.<br>
It is always desirable to provide data at higher data rates through channels<br>
which have limited bandwidth. Many modulation techniques have been<br>
developed for increasing the data rate through a channel. For example, M-ary<br>
phase shift keyed (PSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) techniques<br>
permit compression by encoding a plurality of data bits in each transmitted<br>
symbol. Such systems have constraints associated with them. First, the<br>
hardware associated with such systems is expensive. This is because these<br>
techniques require a high level of channel linearity in order to operate properly.<br>
Consequently, extensive signal processing must be performed for carrier<br>
tracking, symbol recovery, interpolation and signal shaping. Second, such<br>
techniques are sensitive to multipath effects. These effects need to be<br>
compensated for in the receiver. Third, these systems often require bandwidths<br>
beyond those available in some applications (for example in-band on-channel<br>
broadcast FM subcarrier service) for the desired data rates.<br>
In accordance with principles of the present invention, a digital data<br>
modulator is coupled to a source of a digital data signal. An encoder encodes<br>
the digital data using a variable pulse width code. A pulse signal generator<br>
generates pulses representing edges of the encoded digital data signal. A carrier<br>
signal generator generates a carrier signal having carrier pulses corresponding to<br>
the pulses from the pulse signal generator. A corresponding digital data<br>
demodulator is coupled to a source of a modulated signal having carrier pulses<br>
spaced relative to each other to represent a variable pulse width encoded digital<br>
data signal. A detector generates a variable pulse width encoded signal in<br>
response to received carrier pulses. A decoder decodes the variable pulse width<br>
encoded signal to generate the digital data signal.<br>
The technique according to the principles of the present invention may be<br>
implemented using relatively inexpensive circuitry, is insensitive to multipath<br>
interference, and provides substantial bandwidth compression.<br>

produced by the system illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a modulator according to the present<br>
invention. In Fig. 1, an input terminal IN receives a digital signal. The input<br>
terminal IN is coupled to an input terminal of an encoder 10. An output terminal<br>
of the encoder 10 is coupled to an input terminal of a differentiator 20. An<br>
output terminal of the differentiator 20 is coupled to an input terminal of a level<br>
detector 25. An output terminal of the level detector 25 is coupled to a first<br>
input terminal of a mixer 30. A local oscillator 40 is coupled to a second input<br>
terminal of the mixer 30. An output terminal of the mixer 30 is coupled to an<br>
input terminal of a bandpass filter (BPF) 50. An output terminal of the BPF 50 is<br>
coupled to an output terminal OUT, which generates a modulated signal<br>
representing the digital signal at the input terminal IN.<br>
Fig. 2 is a waveform diagram useful in understanding the operation of the<br>
modulator illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 is not drawn to scale in order to more<br>
clearly illustrate the waveforms. In the illustrated embodiment, the digital signal<br>
at the input terminal IN is a bilevel signal in non-return-to-zero (NRZ) format.<br>
This signal is illustrated as the top waveform in Fig. 2. The NRZ signal carries<br>
successive bits, each lasting for a predetermined period called the bit period,<br>
shown by dashed lines in the NRZ signal, and having a corresponding frequency<br>
called the bit rate. The level of the NRZ signal represents the value of that bit,<br>
all in a known manner. The encoder 10 operates to encode the NRZ signal using<br>
a variable pulse width code. In the illustrated embodiment, the variable pulse<br>
width code is a variable aperture code. Variable aperture coding is described in<br>
detail in International Patent Application PCT/US99/05301 of Chandra Mohan,<br>
filed March 11, 1999. In this patent application, an NRZ signal is phase encoded<br>
in the following manner.<br>
Each bit period in the NRZ signal is coded as a transition in the encoded<br>
signal. An encoding clock at a multiple M of the bit rate is used to phase encode<br>
the NRZ signal. In the above mentioned patent application, the encoding clock<br>
runs at a rate M which is nine times the bit rate. When the NRZ signal<br>
transitions from a logic "1" level to a logic "0" level, a transition is made in the<br>
encoded signal eight encoding clock cycles (M-1) from the previous transition.<br>
When the NRZ signal transitions from a logic "0" level to a logic "1" level, a<br>
transition is made in the encoded signal 10 encoding clock cycles (M + 1) from<br>
the previous transition. When the NRZ signal does not transition, that /s if<br>
successive bits have the same value, then a transition is made in the encoded<br>
signal nine encoding clock cycles (M) from the last transition. The variable<br>
aperture coded signal (VAC) is illustrated as the second waveform in Fig. 2.<br>
The variable aperture coded signal (VAC) is differentiated by the<br>
differentiator 20 to produce a series of pulses time aligned with transitions in the<br>
VAC signal. The differentiator also gives a 90 degree phase shift to the VAC<br>
modulating signal. Leading edge transitions produce positive-going pulses and<br>
trailing edge transitions produce negative-going pulses, all in a known manner.<br>
The differentiated VAC signal is illustrated as the third signal in Figure 2.<br>
The signal is level detected by the level detector 25 to generate a series<br>
of trilevel pulses having constant amplitudes. When the differentiated VAC<br>
signal has a value greater than a positive threshold value, a level signal is<br>
generated having a high value; when it has a value less than a negative threshold<br>
value, a level signal is generated having a low value, otherwise it has a center<br>
value, all in a known manner. The level signal is shown as the fourth signal<br>
(LEVEL) in Fig. 2.<br>
The LEVEL signal modulates a carrier signal from the local oscillator 40 in<br>
the mixer 30. A positive pulse produces a pulse of carrier signal having a first<br>
phase, and a negative pulse produces a pulse of carrier signal having a second<br>
phase. The first and second phases are preferably substantially 180 degrees out<br>
of phase. This carrier signal pulse is preferably substantially one coding clock<br>
period long, and in the illustrated embodiment, has a duration of substantially 1/9<br>
of the NRZ bit period. The frequency of the local oscillator 40 signal is selected<br>
so that preferably at least 10 cycles of the local oscillator signal can occur during<br>
the carrier signal pulse time period. In Fig. 2, the carrier signal CARR is<br>
illustrated as the bottom waveform in which the carrier signal is represented by<br>
vertical hatching within respective rectangular envelopes. In the CARR signal<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2, the phase of carrier pulses generated in response to positive-<br>
going LEVEL pulses are represented by a " + ", and the phase of carrier pulses<br>
generated in response to negative-going LEVEL pulses are represented by a "-".<br>
The " + " and "_" represent only substantially 180 degree phase differences and<br>
are not intended to represent any absolute phase.<br>
The BPF 50 filters out all "out-of-band" Fourier components in the CARR<br>
signal, as well as the carrier component itself and one of the sidebands, leaving<br>
only a single sideband sideband. The output signal OUT from the BPF 50, thus,<br>
is a single-side-band (SSB) phase or frequency modulated signal representing the<br>
NRZ data signal at the input terminal IN. This signal may be transmitted to a<br>
receiver by any of the many known transmission techniques.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a receiver which can receive a signal<br>
modulated according to the present invention. In Fig. 3, an input terminal IN is<br>
coupled to a source of a signal modulated as described above with reference to<br>
Figs. 1 and 2. The input terminal IN is coupled to an input terminal of a BPF<br>
110. An output terminal of the BPF 110 is coupled to an input terminal of an<br>
integrator 120. An output terminal of the integrator 120 is coupled to an input<br>
terminal of a limiting amplifier 130. An output terminal of the limiting amplifier<br>
130 is coupled to an input terminal of a detector 140. An output terminal of the<br>
detector 140 is coupled to an input terminal of a decoder 1 50. An output<br>
terminal of the decoder 1 50 reproduces the NRZ signal represented by the<br>
modulated signal at the input terminal IN and is coupled to an output terminal<br>
OUT.<br>
In operation, the BPF 110 filters out out-of-band signals, passing only the<br>
modulated SSB signal. The integrator 120 reverses the 90 degree phase shift<br>
which is introduced by the differentiator 20 (of Fig. 1). The limiting amplifier<br>
130 restricts the amplitude of the signal from the integrator 120 to a constant<br>
amplitude. The signal from the limiting amplifier 130 corresponds to the carrier<br>
pulse signal CARR illustrated in Fig. 2. The detector 140 is either an FM<br>
discriminator, or a phase-locked loop (PLL) used to demodulate the FM or PM<br>
modulated, respectively, carrier pulse signals. The detector 140 detects the<br>
carrier pulses and generates a bilevel signal having transitions represented by the<br>
phase and timings of those pulses. The output of the detector 140 is the<br>
variable bit width signal corresponding to the VAC signal in Fig. 2. The decoder<br>
150 performs the inverse operation of the encoder 10 (of Fig. 1), and generates<br>
the NRZ signal, corresponding to the NRZ signal in Fig. 2, at the output terminal<br>
OUT. The above mentioned Patent application of Chandra Mohan describes a<br>
decoder 150 which may be used in Fig. 3. The NRZ signal at the output terminal<br>
OUT is then processed by utilization circuitry (not shown).<br>
Because the carrier pulses (signal CARR in Fig. 2) occur at well defined<br>
times with respect to each other, and because those pulses are limited in<br>
duration, it is possible to enable the detector 140 only at times when pulses are<br>
expected. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, as described in detail<br>
above, each pulse has a duration substantially 1/9 of the time between NRZ<br>
signal transition times. After a carrier pulse is received 8/9 of the time between<br>
NRZ signal transitions since the preceding carrier pulse (representing a trailing<br>
edge), succeeding pulses are expected only at 9/9 (no transition) or 10/9 (leading<br>
edge) of the time between NRZ signal transitions from that pulse. Similarly, after<br>
a carrier pulse is received 10/9 of the time between NRZ signal transitions since<br>
the preceding carrier pulse (representing a leading edge), succeeding pulses are<br>
expected only at 8/9 (trailing edge) or 9/9 (no transition) of the time between<br>
NRZ signal transitions from that pulse. The detector 140 only need be enabled<br>
when a carrier pulse is expected, and only in the temporal neighborhood of the<br>
duration of the expected pulse.<br>
A windowing timer, illustrated as 160 in phantom in Fig. 3, has an input<br>
terminal coupled to a status output terminal of the detector 140 and an output<br>
terminal coupled to an enable input terminal of the detector 140. The<br>
windowing timer 160 monitors signals from the detector 140 and enables the<br>
detector only when a carrier pulse is expected and only in the temporal<br>
neighborhood of the duration of that pulse, as described above.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the energy in the modulated signal lies<br>
primarily between 0.44 (8/18) and 0.55 (10/18) times the bit rate, and conse-<br>
quently has a bandwidth of 0.11 times the bit rate. This results in increasing the<br>
data rate through the bandwidth by nine times. Other compression ratios are<br>
easily achieved by changing the ratio of the encoding clock to the bit rate, with<br>
trade-offs and constraints one skilled in the art would readily appreciate.<br>
The system described above may be implemented with less sophisticated<br>
circuitry than either M-ary PSK or QAM modulation techniques in both the<br>
transmitter and receiver. More specifically, in the receiver, after the modulated<br>
signal is extracted, limiting amplifiers (e.g. 130) may be used, which is both less<br>
expensive and saves power. Also both the encoding and decoding of the NRZ<br>
signal may be performed with nominally fast programmable logic devices (PLDs).<br>
Such devices are relatively inexpensive (currently $1 to $2). In addition, there is<br>
no intersymbol interference in this system, so waveform shaping is not required.<br>
Further, there are no tracking loops required, except for the clock recovery loop.<br>
Because, as described above, carrier transmission occurs only at bit<br>
boundaries and does not continue for the entire bit period, temporal windowing<br>
may be used in the receiver to detect received carrier pulses only at times when<br>
pulses are expected. Consequently, there are no multi-path problems with the<br>
present system.<br>
One application for the modulation technique described above is to<br>
transmit CD quality digital music simultaneously with FM monophonic and<br>
stereophonic broadcast audio signals. Fig. 4 is a spectrum diagram useful in<br>
understanding this application of the modulation technique illustrated in Figs. 1<br>
and 2. Fig. 4a illustrates the power envelope for FM broadcast signals in the<br>
United States. In Fig. 4a, the horizontal line represents frequency, and<br>
represents a portion of the VHF band somewhere between approximately 88<br>
MHz and approximately 107 MHz. Signal strength is represented in the vertical<br>
direction. The permitted envelopes of spectra of two adjacent broadcast signals<br>
are illustrated. Each carrier is illustrated as a vertical arrow. Around each carrier<br>
are sidebands which carry the broadcast signal FM modulated on the carrier.<br>
In the United States, FM radio stations may broadcast monophonic and<br>
stereophonic audio at full power in sidebands within 100 kHz of the carrier. In<br>
Fig. 4a these sidebands are illustrated unhatched. The broadcaster may<br>
broadcast other information in the sidebands from 100 kHz to 200 kHz, but<br>
power transmitted in this band must be 30 dB down from full power. These<br>
sidebands are illustrated hatched. Adjacent stations (in the same geographical<br>
area) must be separated by at least 400 kHz.<br>
The upper sideband above the carrier of the lower frequency broadcast<br>
signal in Fig. 4a is illustrated in the lower spectrum diagram of Fig. 4b. In Fig.<br>
4b, the vertical direction represents modulation percentage. In Fig. 4b, the<br>
monophonic audio signal L + R audio signal is transmitted in the 0 to 15 kHz<br>
sideband at 90% modulation level. The L - R audio signal is transmitted as a<br>
double-sideband-suppressed-carrier signal around a suppressed subcarrier<br>
frequency of 38 kHz at 45% modulation level. A lower sideband (Isb) runs from<br>
23 kHz to 38 kHz, and an upper sideband (usb) runs from 38 kHz to 53 kHz. A<br>
19 kHz pilot tone (one-half the frequency of the suppressed carrier) is also<br>
included in the sidebands around the main carrier. Thus, 47 kHz in both the<br>
upper sideband (Fig. 4b) and the lower sideband (not shown) around the main<br>
carrier (i.e. from 53 kHz to 100 kHz) remains available to the broadcaster to<br>
broadcast additional information at full power. As described above, from 100<br>
kHz to 200 kHz transmitted power must be 30 dB down from full power.<br>
Using the modulation technique illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, described<br>
above, a 128 kilobit-per-second (kbps) signal, containing an MP3 CD quality<br>
audio signal, may be transmitted in a bandwidth less than 20 kHz. This digital<br>
audio signal may be placed in the space between 53 kHz and 100 kHz in the<br>
upper sideband (for example) and transmitted as a subcarrier signal along with<br>
the regular broadcast stereo audio signal, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. In Fig. 4b, the<br>
digital audio signal is the SSB signal described above centered at 70 kHz, and<br>
runs from approximately 60 kHz to 80 kHz. This is within 100 kHz of the main<br>
carrier and, thus, may be transmitted at full power.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an FM broadcast transmitter incorporating an<br>
in-band-on-channel digital transmission channel implemented according to the<br>
modulation technique described above with reference to Figs. 1 through 3. In<br>
Fig. 5, those elements which are the same as those illustrated in Fig. 1 are<br>
enclosed in a dashed rectangle labeled "Fig. 1", are designated with the same<br>
reference numbers and are not described in detail below. The combination of the<br>
encoder 10, differentiator 20, mixer 30, oscillator 40 and BPF 50 generates an<br>
SSB phase or frequency modulated signal (CARR of Fig. 2) representing a digital<br>
input signal (NRZ of Fig. 2), all as described above with reference to Fig. 1. An<br>
output terminal of the BPF 50 is coupled to an input terminal of an amplifier 60.<br>
An output terminal of the amplifier 60 is coupled to a first input terminal of a<br>
second mixer 70. A second oscillator 80 is coupled to a second input terminal<br>
of the second mixer 70. An output terminal of the second mixer 70 is coupled<br>
to an input terminal of a first filter/amplifier 260. An output terminal of the first<br>
filter/amplifier 260 is coupled to a first input terminal of a signal combiner 250.<br>
An output terminal of a broadcast baseband signal processor 210 is<br>
coupled to a first input terminal of a third mixer 220. A third oscillator 230 is<br>
coupled to a second input terminal of the third mixer 220. An output terminal of<br>
the third mixer 220 is coupled to an input terminal of a second filter/amplifier<br>
240. An output terminal of the second filter/amplifier 240 is coupled to a<br>
second input terminal of the signal combiner 250. An output terminal of the<br>
signal combiner 250 is coupled to an input terminal of a power amplifier 270,<br>
which is coupled to a transmitting antenna 280.<br>
In operation, the encoder 10 receives a digital signal representing the<br>
digital audio signal. In a preferred embodiment, this signal is an MP3 compliant<br>
digital audio signal. More specifically, the digital audio data stream is forward-<br>
error-correction (FEC) encoded using a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. Then the FEC<br>
encoded data stream is packetized. This packetized data is then compressed by<br>
the circuitry illustrated in Fig. 1, into an SSB signal, as described in detail above.<br>
The frequency of the signal produced by the oscillator 40 is selected to be<br>
10.7 MHz, so the digital information from the encoder 10 is modulated to a<br>
center frequency of 10.7 MHz. The modulation frequency may be any<br>
frequency, but is more practically selected so that it corresponds to the<br>
frequencies of existing low cost BPF filters. For example, typical BPF filters have<br>
center frequencies of 6 MHz, 10.7 MHz, 21.4 MHz, 70 MHz, 140 MHz, etc. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, 10.7 MHz is selected for the modulating frequency,<br>
and the BPF 50 is implemented as one of the existing 10.7 MHz filters. The<br>
filtered SSB signal from the BPF 50 is amplified by amplifier 60 and up-converted<br>
by the combination of the second mixer 70 and second oscillator 80. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the second oscillator 80 generates a signal at 77.57<br>
MHz and the SSB is up-converted to 88.27 MHz. This signal is filtered and<br>
further amplified by the first filter/amplifier 260.<br>
The broadcast baseband signal processor 210 receives a stereo audio<br>
signal (not shown) and performs the signal processing necessary to form the<br>
baseband composite stereo signal, including the L + R signal at baseband, the<br>
double-sideband-suppressed-carrier L - R signal at a (suppressed) carrier<br>
frequency of 38 kHz and a 19 kHz pilot tone, all in a known manner. This signal<br>
is then modulated onto a carrier signal at the assigned frequency of the FM<br>
station. The third oscillator 230 produces a carrier signal at the assigned<br>
broadcast frequency which, in the illustrated embodiment, is 88.2 MHz. The<br>
third mixer 220 generates a modulated signal modulated with the baseband<br>
composite monophonic and stereophonic audio signals as illustrated in Fig. 4b.<br>
The modulated signal, at a carrier frequency of 88.2 MHz and with the standard<br>
broadcast audio sidebands illustrated in Fig. 4b, is then filtered and amplified by<br>
the second filter/amplifier 240. This signal is combined with the SSB modulated<br>
digital signal from the first filter/amplifier 260 to form a composite signal. This<br>
composite signal includes both the standard broadcast stereophonic audio<br>
sidebands modulated on the carrier at 88.2 MHz, and the SSB modulated signal<br>
carrying the digital audio signal centered at 70 kHz above the carrier (88.27<br>
MHz), as illustrated in Fig. 4b. This composite signal is then power amplified by<br>
the power amplifier 270 and supplied to the transmitting antenna 280 for<br>
transmission to FM radio receivers.<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an FM broadcast receiver which can receive a<br>
signal modulated by an FM broadcast transmitter illustrated in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6,<br>
those elements which are the same as those illustrated in Fig. 3 are outlined with<br>
a dashed rectangle labeled Fig. 3, are designated with the same reference<br>
numbers and are not described in detail below. In Fig. 6, a receiving antenna<br>
302 is coupled to an RF amplifier 304. An output terminal of the RF amplifier<br>
304 is coupled to a first input terminal of a first mixer 306. An output terminal<br>
of a first oscillator 308 is coupled to a second input terminal of the first mixer<br>
306. An output terminal of the first mixer 306 is coupled to respective input<br>
terminals of a BPF 310 and a tunable BPF 110. An output terminal of the BPF<br>
310 is coupled to an input terminal of an intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier<br>
312 which may be a limiting amplifier. An output terminal of the IF amplifier<br>
312 is coupled to an input terminal of an FM detector 314. An output terminal<br>
of the FM detector 314 is coupled to an input terminal of an FM stereo decoder<br>
316.<br>
In operation, the RF amplifier 304 receives and amplifies RF signals from<br>
the receiving antenna 304. The first oscillator 308 generates a signal at 98.9<br>
MHz. The combination of the first oscillator 308 and the first mixer 306 down-<br>
converts the 88.2 MHz main carrier signal to 10.7 MHz, and the SSB digital<br>
audio signal from 88.27 MHz to 10.63 MHz. The BPF 310 passes only the FM<br>
stereo sidebands (L + R and L-R) around 10.7 MHz in a known manner. The IF<br>
amplifier 312 amplifies this signal and provides it to an FM detector 314 which<br>
generates the baseband composite stereo signal. The FM stereo decoder 316<br>
decodes the baseband composite stereo signal to generate monophonic and/or<br>
stereophonic audio signals (not shown) representing the transmitted audio<br>
signals, all in a known manner.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the tunable BPF 110 is tuned to a center<br>
frequency of 10.63 MHz, and passes only the digital audio signal around that<br>
frequency. In the illustrated embodiment, the passband of the BPF 110 runs<br>
from 10.53 MHz to 10.73 MHz. The combination of the BPF 110, integrator<br>
120, limiting amplifier 130, detector 140, decoder 150 and windowing timer<br>
160 operates to extract the modulated digital audio signal, and demodulate and<br>
decode that signal to reproduce the digital audio signal, in the manner described<br>
above with reference to Fig. 3. The digital audio signals from the decoder 150<br>
are processed in an appropriate manner by further circuitry (not shown) to<br>
generate audio signals corresponding to the transmitted digital audio signal.<br>
More specifically, the signal is depacketized, and any errors introduced during<br>
transmission are detected and corrected. The corrected bit stream is then<br>
converted to a stereo audio signal, all in a known manner.<br>
The embodiment described above provides the equivalent compression<br>
performance of a 1024 QAM system. However, in practice QAM systems are<br>
limited to around 256 QAM due to the difficulty of correcting noise and<br>
multipath intersymbol interference resulting from the tight constellation spacing.<br>
The above system has no ISI problem because of the narrow and widely spaced<br>
carrier pulses. In short, higher data rates may be transmitted in narrower<br>
bandwidth channels with none of the problems associated with other techniques,<br>
such as QAM.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 2, in the CARR signal, it may be seen that there are<br>
relatively wide gaps between carrier pulses during which no carrier signal is<br>
transmitted. These gaps may be utilized in an alternate embodiment of the<br>
invention. Fig. 7 is a more detailed waveform diagram of the CARR signal useful<br>
in understanding the operation of a modulator in accordance with this alternate<br>
embodiment. As described above, in the encoder illustrated in Fig. 1 an<br>
encoding clock signal has a period one-ninth of the bit period of the NRZ signal.<br>
Dashed vertical lines in Fig. 7 represent encoding clock signal periods. Permitted<br>
time locations of carrier pulses are represented by dashed rectangles. A carrier<br>
pulse may occur either 8, 9 or 10 clock pulses after a preceding one. Thus,<br>
carrier pulses may occur in any one of three adjacent clock periods. Carrier<br>
pulse A is assumed to be 8 clock pulses from the previous one, carrier pulse B is<br>
assumed to be 9 clock pulses from the preceding one, and carrier pulse C is<br>
assumed to be 10 clock pulses from the preceding one.<br>
As described above, when a carrier pulse is 8 clock pulses from the<br>
preceding one (A), this indicates a trailing edge in the NRZ signal, and can only<br>
be immediately followed by either a 9 clock pulse interval (D), representing no<br>
change in the NRZ signal, or a 10 clock pulse interval (E), representing a leading<br>
edge in the NRZ signal. Similarly when a carrier pulse is 10 clock pulses from<br>
the preceding one (C), this indicates a trailing edge in the NRZ signal, and can<br>
only be immediately followed by either an 8 clock pulse interval (E), representing<br>
a leading edge in the NRZ signal, or 9 clock pulse interval (F), representing no<br>
change in the NRZ signal. When a carrier pulse is 9 clock pulses from the<br>
preceding one (B|, this indicates no change in the NRZ signal, and can be<br>
immediately followed by either an 8 clock pulse (D), representing a trailing edge<br>
in the NRZ signal, a 9 clock pulse (E), representing no change in the NRZ signal,<br>
or a 10 clock pulse (F) interval, representing a leading edge in the NRZ signal.<br>
This is all illustrated on Fig. 7. It is apparent that of the nine encoding clock<br>
periods in a NRZ bit period, one of three adjacent pulses can potentially have<br>
carrier pulses, while the other six cannot have a carrier pulse.<br>
During the interval when no carrier pulses may be produced in the CA.RR<br>
signal (from times t4 to t10), other auxiliary data may be modulated on the<br>
carrier signal. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 as a rounded rectangle (AUX DATA)<br>
with vertical hatching. A guard period of Dt after the last potential carrier pulse<br>
(C) and before the next succeeding potential carrier pulse (D) surrounding this<br>
gap is maintained to minimize potential interference between the carrier pulses<br>
(A) - (F) carrying the digital audio signal and the carrier modulation {AUX DATA)<br>
carrying the auxiliary data.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention which<br>
can implement the inclusion of auxiliary data in the modulated encoded data<br>
stream. In Fig. 8, those elements which are the same as those illustrated in Fig.<br>
1 are designated by the same reference number and are not described in detail<br>
below. In Fig. 8, a source (not shown) of auxiliary data (AUX) is coupled to an<br>
input terminal of a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer 402. An output terminal of the<br>
FIFO buffer 402 is coupled to a first data input terminal of a multiplexer 404. An<br>
output terminal of the multiplexer 404 is coupled to an input terminal of the<br>
mixer 30. The output terminal of the differentiator 20 is coupled to a second<br>
data input terminal of the multiplexer 404. A timing output terminal of the<br>
encoder 10 is coupled to a control input terminal of the multiplexer 404.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the auxiliary data signal is assumed to be in<br>
condition to directly modulate the carrier signal. One skilled in the art will<br>
understand how to encode and otherwise prepare a signal to modulate a carrier<br>
in a manner most appropriate to the characteristics of that signal. In addition, in<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the auxiliary data signal is assumed to be in digital<br>
form. This is not necessary, however. The auxiliary data signal may also be an<br>
analog signal.<br>
In operation, the encoder 10 includes internal timing circuitry (not shown)<br>
which controls the relative timing of the pulses. This timing circuitry may be<br>
modified in a manner understood by one skilled in the art to generate a signal<br>
having a first state during the three adjacent encoding clock periods t1 to t4,<br>
when pulses may potentially occur in the CARR signal, and a second state during<br>
the remaining encoding clock periods t4 to t10. This signal may be used to<br>
control the multiplexer 404 to couple the output terminal of the differentiator 20<br>
to the input terminal of the mixer 30 during the periods (t1 to t4) when pulses<br>
may occur and to couple the output terminal of the FIFO buffer 402 to the mixer<br>
30 otherwise (t4 + At to t10 - At). During the periods (t1 to t4) when the<br>
output terminal of the differentiator 20 is coupled to the mixer 30, the circuit of<br>
Fig. 8 is in the configuration illustrated in Fig. 1, and operates as described<br>
above in detail.<br>
During the periods (t4 + At to t10 - At) when the FIFO buffer 402 is<br>
coupled to the mixer 30, the data from the FIFO buffer 402 modulates the carrier<br>
signal from the oscillator 40. The FIFO buffer 402 operates to receive the digital<br>
auxiliary data signal at a constant bit rate, and buffer the signal during the time<br>
periods (t1 -14) when carrier pulses (A) - (C) may be produced. The FIFO buffer<br>
402 then provides the stored auxiliary data to the mixer 30 at a higher bit rate<br>
during the time period (t4 + At to t10 - At) when the auxiliary data is to be<br>
transmitted. The net throughput of the bursts of auxiliary data through the<br>
CARR signal must: match the constant net throughput of auxiliary data from the<br>
auxiliary data signal source (not shown). One skilled in the art will understand<br>
how to match the throughputs, and also how to provide for overruns and<br>
underruns, all in a known manner.<br>
Fig. 9 is a block diagram of a receiver which can receive the signal<br>
produced by the system illustrated in Fig. 8. In Fig. 9, those elements which are<br>
the same as those illustrated in Fig. 3 are designated with the same reference<br>
number and are not described in detail below. In Fig. 9, the output terminal of<br>
the detector 140 is coupled to an input terminal of a controllable switch 406. A<br>
first output terminal of the controllable switch 406 is coupled to the input<br>
terminal of the decoder 1 50. A second output terminal of the controllable<br>
switch 406 is coupled to an input terminal of a FIFO 408. An output terminal of<br>
the FIFO 408 produces the auxiliary data (AUX). The output terminal of the<br>
windowing timer 160 is coupled, not to an enable input terminal of the detector<br>
140, as in Fig. 3, but instead to a control input terminal of the controllable<br>
switch 406.<br>
In operation, the detector 140 in Fig. 9 is always enabled. The windowing<br>
signal from the windowing timer 160 corresponds to the timing signal generated<br>
by the encoder 10 in Fig. 8. The windowing signal has a first state during the<br>
period (t1 to t4) when carrier pulses (A)-(C) could potentially occur, and a<br>
second state otherwise (t4 to t10). During the period (t1 to t4) when carrier<br>
pulses (A)-(C) could potentially occur the windowing timer 160 conditions the<br>
controllable switch 406 to couple the detector 140 to the decoder 150. This<br>
configuration is identical to that illustrated in Fig. 3, and operates as described<br>
above in detail.<br>
During the remainder of the bit period (t4 to t10), the detector 140 is<br>
coupled to the FIFO 408. During this period, the modulated auxiliary data is<br>
demodulated and supplied to the FIFO 408. In a corresponding manner to the<br>
FIFO 402 (of Fig. 8), the FIFO 408 receives the auxiliary data bursts from the<br>
detector 140, and generates an auxiliary data output signal AUX at a constant<br>
bit rate. The auxiliary data signal represents the auxiliary data as encoded for<br>
modulating the carrier. Further processing (not shown) may be necessary do<br>
decode the received auxiliary data signal to the desired format.<br>
