According to the invention there is provided a key case comprising a holder member and closure member fitted together, the closure member comprising a plurality of bosses at the abutting surface thereof, the holder member comprising correspondingly profiled holes at the abutting surface thereof, at least one oblong recess with its one end open and the other end   closed, the holder<br><br><br>
member further comprising holding means, a key slidably located within the oblong recess from its open end with the key head facing the closed end thereof and the closure member comprising a slider located against a step in an oblong open slot provided therein and provided with clamping means one end of the slider being pivoted on the key head and the opposite end of the slider being provided with a grip.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention , the closure member and holder member are made of plastic, the closure member and the holder member being fitted together by engaging the bosses in the correspondingly profiled holes and by heat sealing.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the clamping means comprises a pair of lateral protrusions provided at the opposite sidewalls of the slider at the center thereof and adapted to be disposed in correspondingly profiled depressions provided at the opposite side walls of the oblong open slot at   the   center  thereof  against   lateral   projections   at  the<br><br><br>
opposite side walls of the oblong open slot at the center thereof disposed within the depressions.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the holding means comprises a holding ring looped around a sidewall of an opening provided in a lobe at one end of the holder member.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the grip at the opposite end of the slider comprises a notch.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig 1 is an exploded view of a key case according to an embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig 2 is an isometric bottom view of the closure member of the key case of Fig 1;<br><br>
Figs 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d show different positions of the slider and key of the key case of Fig 1 in the fully assembled condition thereof;<br>
Fig 4 is cross section at A-A in Fig 3a; and<br>
Fig 5 shows cross sectional view of a key case according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
As illustrated in Figs 1 to 4 of the accompanying drawings, 1 is a key case comprising a holder member 2 and closure member 3, both made of plastics. The closure member is provided with a plurality of bosses 4 at the abutting surface 5 thereof and the holder member is provided with correspondingly profiled holes 6 at the abutting surface 7 thereof. The closure member and holder member are fitted together by engaging the bosses in the corresponding profiled holes and by heat sealing. The holder member comprises an oblong recess 8 whose one end marked 9 is open and the other end marked 10 is closed. The holder member is also provided with a holding ring 11 looped around a sidewall 12 of an opening 13 provided in a lobe 14 at one end thereof.   15 is a key located within the<br><br>
oblong recess from its open end with the key head 15a racing the opposite closed end of the oblong recess. The closure member comprises a slider 16 located against a step 17 in an oblong open slot 17a therein. The slider is provided with a pair of lateral protrusions 18, 18 at the center of opposite sidewalls 19, 19 thereof. 20,20 are correspondingly profiled depressions provided at the opposite sidewalls 21,21 of the oblong open slot at the center thereof. 22, 22 are lateral projections provided at the center of opposite sidewalls 21,21 of the oblong open slot disposed within the depressions. One end of the slider is provided with a cut 23 wherein a pivot pin. 24 is located and the slider is pivoted onto the pivot pin by passing cross pin 25 through a hole 26 in the pivot pin and corresponding holes 27, 27 provided in sidewalls 28, 28 of the cut. The distal end 29 of the pivot pin is square shaped and is fitted in a square shaped slot 30 provided in the key head. Due to engagement of the square shaped distal end of the pivot pin in the square shaped slot in the key head, rotation of the pivot pin in the slot does^not take place. The opposite end of the slider is provided with a notch 31.<br><br>
Normally the key is completely housed in the key case and the shder is located in the oblong open slot in the closure member flush with it (Fig 3a). The shder is clamped to the closure member as the lateral protrusions lie underneath the lateral projections at the center of the opposite sidewalls of the open oblong slot (Fig 4). When the key is to be shd out to lock or unlock a lock (not shown) the shder is lifted up about the pivot pin holding its opposite end (Fig 3b). When the shder is lifted up the lateral protrusions shde out against the lateral projections by snap action and disengage from the lateral projections. The shder is shd along the oblong open slot in the left hand direction in Fig 3b till it reaches the extreme left hand end of the oblong open slot (Fig 3c). At this position the key remains fully shd out of the key case. When the shder is turned down about the pivot pin in the right hand direction in Fig 3c, the lateral protrusions shde in against the lateral projections by snap action and he thereunder and the shder lies in the oblong open slot flush with the closure member clamped thereto(Fig 3d). In this position the key cannot be pushed inside. The key is used to lock or unlock the lock. When the key has to be shd in fully in the key case the shder is lifted up about the pivot pin holding the opposite end thereof. The lifted up position of the shder is as shown in Fig 3c, The shder<br><br>
 is slid along the oblong slot in the right hand direction in Fig 3c till it reaches the extreme right hand end of the oblong slot (Fig 3b). When the shder is being slid in the right hand direction in Fig 3c the key shdes with the shder into the oblong recess and is fully housed in the oblong recess in the holder member and the key case. The shder is turned down about the pivot pin and is made to he in the oblong open slot clamped to the closure member (Fig 3a).<br>
The notch at the opposite end of the shder provides a finger grip to facilitate lifting or lowering of the shder about the pivot pin.<br>
As the key is completely housed in the key case in the non-operative position thereof it remains in position unexposed and is safe to carry in a pocket or pouch as it does not tear or damage the pocket or pouch. The holding ring makes it easy to carry the key case. Besides the key case is compact and simple in construction.<br>
The key case of Fig 5 of the accompanying drawings comprises a pair of oblong recesses 8a and 8b provided at the top and bottom surfaces<br><br>
thereof and associated closure members 3a and 3b respectively. Keys 15b and 15c are slidably located within the oblong recesses and one ends of the sliders 16a and 16b are pivoted to the corresponding key heads by pivot pins 24a and 24b. The embodiment of Fig 5 thus comprises a key case housing two keys located therein. It is otherwise similar to the key case of figs 1 to 4 both in construction and working.<br>
The holder member and closure member may be of different geometry / construction. Besides the holder member and closure member may be made of other materials such as aluminium, or steel and may be fitted together in a different manner or by different arrangement. The clamping means and holding means may be of different constructions. The grip at the opposite end of the slider may be of different construction. Such variations of the invention are to be construed  and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
