				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR POLLING<br>
A PROTOCOL DATA UNIT OF A TRANSMISSION BUFFER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention generally relates to communications systems, and<br>
more particularly to a system and method for controlling the transmission of<br>
polling information with one or more protocol data units in a wireless<br>
communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third<br>
generation mobile communication system that has evolved from a standard<br>
known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). This standard<br>
is a European standard which aims to provide an improved mobile<br>
communication service based on a GSM core network and wideband code<br>
division multiple access (W-CDMA) technology. In December, 1998, the<br>
ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1 of the United States, and the<br>
TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for the<br>
purpose of creating the specification for standardizing the UMTS.<br>
The work towards standardizing the UMTS performed by the 3GPP<br>
has resulted in the formation of five technical specification groups (TSG),<br>
each of which is directed to forming network elements having independent<br>
operations. More specifically, each TSG develops, approves, and manages<br><br>
a standard specification in a related region. Among them, a radio access<br>
network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops a specification for the function,<br>
items desired, and interface of a UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
(UTRAN), which is a new RAN for supporting a W-CDMA access technology<br>
in the UMTS.<br>
The TSG-RAN group includes a plenary group and four working<br>
groups. Working group 1 (WG1) develops a specification for a physical layer<br>
(a first layer). Working group 2 (WG2) specifies the functions of a data link<br>
layer (a second layer) and a network layer (a third layer). Working group 3<br>
(WG3) defines a specification for an interface among a base station in the<br>
UTRAN, a radio network controller (RNC), and a core network. And, Working<br>
group 4 (WG4) discusses terms desired for a radio link performance and<br>
items desired for radio resource management.<br>
Figure 1 shows the structure of a radio access interface protocol used<br>
between a terminal operating based on a 3GPP RAN specification and a<br>
UTRAN. When viewed horizontally, the radio access interface protocol<br>
includes a physical layer (PHY), a data link layer, and a network layer; and<br>
when viewed vertically the protocol is divided into a control plane (C-plane)<br>
for transmitting a control signal and a user plane for transmitting data<br>
information. The user plane is a region to which traffic information of a user<br>
such as voice or an IP packet is transmitted. The control plane is a region to<br>
which control information such as an interface of a network or maintenance<br>
and management of a call is transmitted.<br><br>
The protocol layers may be divided into a first layer (L1), a second<br>
layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an open<br>
system interconnection (OSI) standard model well known in a<br>
communication system.<br>
The first layer (L1) operates as a physical layer (PHY) for a radio<br>
interface, and according to related technology is connected to an upper<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer through one or more transport channels.<br>
The physical layer transmits data delivered to the physical layer (PHY)<br>
through a transport channel to a receiver using various coding and<br>
modulating methods suitable for radio circumstances. The transport channel<br>
between the physical layer (PHY) and the MAC layer is divided into a<br>
dedicated transport channel and a common transport channel based on<br>
whether it is exclusively used by a single terminal or shared by several<br>
terminals.<br>
The second layer L2 operates as a data link layer and lets various<br>
terminals share the radio resources of a W-CDMA network. The second<br>
layer L2 is divided into the MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, and a broadcast/multicast<br>
control (BMC) layer.<br>
The MAC layer delivers data through an appropriate mapping<br>
relationship between a logical channel and a transport channel. The logical<br>
channels connect an upper layer to the MAC layer. Various logical channels<br>
are provided according to the kind of transmitted information. In general,<br><br>
when information of the control plane is transmitted, a control channel is<br>
used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a traffic channel is<br>
used. The MAC layer is divided three sub-layers according to performed<br>
functions. The three sub-layers are a MAC-d sub-layer that is positioned in<br>
the SRNC and manages the dedicated transport channel, a MAC-c/sh sub-<br>
layer that is positioned in the CRNC and manages the common transport<br>
channel, and a MAC-hs sub-layer that is positioned in the Node B and<br>
manages the HS-DSCH transmission.<br>
The RLC layer forms an appropriate RLC protocol data unit (PDU)<br>
suitable for transmission by the segmentation and concatenation functions of<br>
an RLC service data unit (SDU) received from an upper layer. The RLC layer<br>
also performs an automatic repeat request (ARQ) function by which an<br>
RLC PDU lost during transmission is re-transmitted. The RLC layer operates<br>
in three modes, a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode (UM),<br>
and an acknowledged mode (AM). The mode selected depends upon the<br>
method used to process the RLC SDU received from the upper layer. An<br>
RLC buffer stores the RLC SDUs or the RLC PDUs received from the upper<br>
layer exists in the RLC layer.<br>
The packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer is an upper layer<br>
of the RLC layer which allows data items to be transmitted through a network<br>
protocol such as the IPv4 or the IPv6. A header compression technique for<br>
compressing and transmitting the header information in a packet can be<br>
used for effective transmission of the IP packet.<br><br>
The broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer allows a message to be<br>
transmitted from a cell broadcast center (CBC) through the radio interface.<br>
The main function of the BMC layer is scheduling and transmitting a cell<br>
broadcast message to a terminal. In general, data is transmitted through the<br>
RLC layer operating in the unacknowledged mode.<br>
The PDCP layer and the BMC layer are located only in the user plane<br>
because they transmit only user data. Unlike the PDCP layer and the BMC<br>
layer, the RLC layer can be included in the user plane and the control plane<br>
according to the upper layer connected. When the RLC layer belongs to the<br>
control plane, data is received from a radio resource control (RRC) layer. In<br>
the other cases, the RLC layer belongs to the user plane. In general, the<br>
transmission service of user data provided to the upper layer by the second<br>
layer (L2) in the user plane is referred to as a radio bearer (RB). The<br>
transmission service of control information provided to the upper layer by the<br>
second layer (L2) in the control plane is referred to as a signaling radio<br>
bearer (SRB). As shown in Figure 1, a plurality of entities can exist in the<br>
RLC and PDCP layers. This is because a terminal has a plurality of RBs, and<br>
one or two RLC entities and only one PDCP entity are generally used for one<br>
RB. The entities of the RLC layer and the PDCP layer can perform an<br>
independent function in each layer.<br>
The RRC layer positioned in the lowest portion of the third layer (L3)<br>
is defined only in the control plane and controls the logical channels, the<br>
transport channels, and the physical channels in relation to the setup, the<br><br>
reconfiguration, and the release of the RBs. At this time, setting up the RB<br>
means processes of stipulating the characteristics of a protocol layer and a<br>
channel, which are required for providing a specific service, and setting the<br>
respective detailed parameters and operation methods. It is possible to<br>
transmit control messages received from the upper layer through a RRC<br>
message.<br>
The RLC layer will now be described in more detail. As previously<br>
indicated, the RLC layer operates in three modes: TM, UM, and AM. The<br>
AM mode will now be described, as it is preferable for use with the present<br>
invention.<br>
One of the most significant characteristics of AM mode operation is its<br>
ability to support the re-transmission of a PDU when the PDU is not<br>
successfully transmitted or received. More specifically, when the transmitter<br>
RLC layer transmits a PDU, the receiver determines whether each PDU is<br>
received and then generates status information indicating the result. The<br>
receiver then sends status information back to inform the transmitter as to<br>
whether the PDU was received. When the transmitter receives status<br>
information from the receiver indicating that the PDU was not received, the<br>
PDU is re-transmitted to the receiver.<br>
Figure 2 shows a structure of an AM RLC transmitter 100 which<br>
transmits PDUs to a receiver. As shown, when a PDU generator 101<br>
receives an SDU from an upper layer, the PDU generator segments or<br>
concatenates the SDU in order to make the SDU a uniform size of a PDU. A<br><br>
PDU may be generated by adding an RLC header to each segment, and a<br>
sequence number may be included in the header. The PDU may be<br>
classified based on its sequence number.<br>
PDUs generated in this way are stored in both a transmission buffer<br>
102 and a re-transmission buffer 104. The transmitter AM RLC sends the<br>
PDUs stored in transmission buffer 102 to a lower layer based on a number<br>
requested by the lower layer every transmission time interval (TTI). At this<br>
time, a polling bit setting unit 103 determines whether to set a polling bit<br>
requesting the receiver to send status information for a specific PDU among<br>
the transmitted PDUs. In which PDU the polling bit is to be set varies<br>
according to a polling trigger.<br>
The PDUs sent to the lower layer are transmitted to the receiver<br>
through a radio interface. In the receiver, an AM RLC forms SDUs using<br>
information in the headers of the PDUs, and SDUs are then delivered to the<br>
receiver upper layer.<br>
When the polling bit is set in one PDU among the received PDUs, the<br>
receiver AM RLC checks whether the PDUs are correctly received and<br>
transmits status information to the transmitter AM RLC. The transmitter AM<br>
RLC deletes successfully transmitted PDUs from re-transmission buffer 104<br>
based on positive status information. PDUs that are not successfully<br>
transmitted, as determined by negative status information, are sent to the<br>
transmission buffer and are re-transmitted. Only PDUs which receive a<br>
negative acknowledgment are re-transmitted. The re-transmitted PDUs are<br><br>
left in the re-transmission buffer until the transmission is determined to be<br>
successful. Re-transmitted PDUs may be given priority over first-transmitted<br>
PDUs, and it is possible to set a polling bit in the re-transmitted PDU.<br>
In AM RLC, a transmission window and reception window are<br>
respectively used in the transmitter and receiver for transmitting and<br>
receiving PDUs. In general, the size of the transmission window is the same<br>
as the size of the reception window.<br>
The transmission window has a size which corresponds to a<br>
predetermined maximum number of PDUs that can be transmitted. After<br>
PDUs within the range of the window are transmitted from a transmission<br>
buffer, subsequent PDUs are loaded into the buffer and transmitted within an<br>
updated transmission window. The transmission window may be updated<br>
based on status information from the receiver. Updating the transmission<br>
window may involve moving a lower limit (or position) of the window based<br>
on a previously transmitted PDU for which a negative acknowledgment has<br>
been received.<br>
For example, consider the case where the limits of a transmission<br>
window extend from 1 to 100 (the size of the transmission window is 100<br>
PDU positions) and PDUs corresponding to 1 through 50 are transmitted.<br>
When status information indicating that PDU Nos. 15, 20, and 40 were not<br>
successfully transmitted and the remaining PDUs were successfully<br>
transmitted is received from the receiver, the transmission window is<br>
updated (e.g., the lower and upper limits of the window are moved) to 15<br><br>
through 114. The PDUs are then transmitted in the order of 15, 20, 40, 51,<br>
52, and 53, i.e., the retransmitted PDUs are given priority over the first-<br>
transmitted PDUs.<br>
The reception window in the receiver receives only PDUs that lie<br>
within a valid range. More specifically, the receiver receives only PDUs<br>
having transmission sequence numbers that lie within the limits of the<br>
reception window. PDUs received beyond the range of the reception<br>
window are discarded as soon as the PDUs are received. The reception<br>
window is updated only when a new in-sequence PDU is received in the<br>
reception window.<br>
For example, consider the case where a reception window extends<br>
from 1 through 100 (the size of the reception window is 100 PDU positions),<br>
PDUs corresponding to 1 through 50 are received, but PDU Nos. 15, 20, and<br>
40 PDUs are not successfully received. When this occurs, the reception<br>
window is updated so that its limits extend from 15 through 114. The case<br>
where PDUs are not successfully received may correspond to the case<br>
where the PDUs are not transmitted or the PDUs are received with errors.<br>
A Polling means the transmitter requests status information from the<br>
receiver. When the receiver receives a polling request from the transmitter,<br>
the receiver must check the reception state of PDUs received up to that point<br>
(e.g., at the point when a last PDU containing a polling bit was received).<br>
The receiver then sends information concerning this reception state to the<br>
transmitter. More specifically, for polling, the transmitter sets a polling bit in a<br><br>
PDU before transmission. When the PDU containing the polling bit is<br>
received, the receiver checks the state of a reception buffer with respect to<br>
this and previously received PDUs, and then informs the transmitter of<br>
information concerning whether each PDU up to that point was successfully<br>
received.<br>
Because transmitting status information wastes radio resources,<br>
transmission of status information must be controlled by an appropriate<br>
method. That is, the transmitter must set the polling bit only for a PDU which<br>
satisfies a certain rule, without requesting the status information to every<br>
PDU. Such a rule is known as a polling trigger.<br>
One method used to define the polling trigger is based on the last<br>
PDU stored in the transmission buffer. More specifically, in this method the<br>
polling bit is set when the last PDU in the transmission buffer is transmitted..<br>
Thus, as shown in Figure 3, in the case where PDUs corresponding to 1<br>
through 50 are stored in the transmission buffer, when the PDU whose<br>
transmission sequence number is 50 is transmitted, the polling bit is set in<br>
the 50th PDU.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart showing a related method for setting the polling<br>
bit using the last PDU in the transmission buffer. In this method, the PDUs<br>
in the transmission buffer are sequentially selected every TTI based on the<br>
number of PDUs requested by the lower layer (S101). In a next step, for<br>
each PDU selected, a check is performed to determine whether the selected<br>
PDU is the last PDU in the transmission buffer (S102). When it is determined<br><br>
that the selected PDU is the last PDU in the transmission buffer, the polling<br>
bit is set in the selected PDU (S103) and the PDU is transmitted to the<br>
receiver (S104). When it is determined that the corresponding PDU is not the<br>
last PDU in the transmission buffer, the selected PDU is transmitted without<br>
a polling bit (S104). The method then waits until the next TTI (S105) and<br>
the above process is repeated.<br>
The related method has at least one drawback that impairs the<br>
performance of communications between the transmitter and receiver.<br>
Specifically, because the transmission window is not considered in the<br>
conventional method for setting the polling bit, the transmitter and receiver<br>
AM RLCs may experience deadlocked condition.<br>
This deadlock condition arises, for example, when a number of PDUs<br>
beyond the range of the transmission window are stored in the transmission<br>
buffer. When this condition exists, the PDUs exceeding the range of the<br>
transmission window cannot be transmitted until the transmission window is<br>
updated to a point where these PDUs lie within the transmission window<br>
range. However, because the last PDU in the transmission window does not<br>
correspond to the last PDU in the transmission buffer, the last PDU in the<br>
transmission window will not be transmitted with a polling bit. As a result,<br>
even if the receiver successfully receives the last PDU, it will not send status<br>
information back to the transmitter. Accordingly, the transmission window will<br>
not be updated, no additional PDUs will be transmitted, and thus the<br>
transmitter and receiver are placed in a deadlocked state.<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates this deadlocked condition. As shown, when the<br>
transmission window has a size which corresponds to PDUs 1 through 100<br>
(the size of the transmission window is 100 PDU positions) and PDUs 1<br>
through 150 are received from the upper layer of the transmitter and stored<br>
in the transmission buffer, the transmitter and receiver will be deadlocked.<br>
This is because the polling bit is set when the last-stored PDU in the buffer<br>
(i.e., PDU No. 150) is transmitted, when the related method of polling is used.<br>
Under these circumstances, because the size of the transmission window is<br>
only 100 PDU positions, the transmitter can only transmit PDU 1 through 100.<br>
As a result, all PDUs within the range of the transmission window are<br>
transmitted without the polling bit.<br>
On the receiver side, the receiver does not send status information to<br>
the transmitter because no PDU has been received in which the polling bit is<br>
set among the received PDUs. Because no status information has been<br>
sent back from the receiver, the transmission window will not be updated<br>
and thus the remaining PDUs in the buffer (e.g., PDUs 101 - 150) will not be<br>
transmitted. The transmitter and receiver are therefore deadlocked. During<br>
this condition, transmission is not performed even through the network has<br>
the ability to transmit the PDUs. Accordingly, network resources are used<br>
ineffectively and an unnecessary delay state is caused.<br>
A need therefore exists for an improved method of increasing the<br>
efficiency and quality of voice and data transmissions in a mobile<br>
communications system, and more specifically one which achieves these<br><br>
advantages by preventing a deadlock condition from arising between a<br>
system transmitter and receiver.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to solve at least the above problems<br>
and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method for improving the speed, efficiency, and quality of communications<br>
in a mobile communications system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to achieve the<br>
aforementioned object by using a polling scheme which ensures that a<br>
deadlock condition will not arise between a transmitter and receiver of the<br>
mobile system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method which prevents deadlock using a polling trigger based solely or<br>
partially on a predetermined position of a transmission window.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention are<br>
achieved by providing a method which prevents a deadlock condition from<br>
occurring a communications system based on one of a variety of polling<br>
triggers. In accordance with one embodiment, the method includes selecting<br>
a data unit from a buffer, determining whether the data unit is a last data unit<br>
in a transmission window, and transmitting polling information with the data<br><br>
unit if the data unit is determined to be the last data unit in the transmission<br>
window. At least the determining step may be performed in an radio link<br>
control layer operating in AM mode. If the data unit is not the last data unit in<br>
a transmission window, the method may further include determining whether<br>
the data unit is a last data unit in the buffer and transmitting polling<br>
information (e.g., a polling request) with the data unit if the data unit is<br>
determined to be the last data unit in the buffer. If the data unit is not the last<br>
data unit in the buffer, the data unit may be transmitted without a polling<br>
request. The buffer may be a transmission buffer or a re-transmission buffer.<br>
The method may include an optional step of determining whether the<br>
data unit has been previously transmitted, and transmitting the polling<br>
information with the data unit if the data unit is determined to be the last data<br>
unit among the re-transmitted data units in the transmission window.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the method of the present<br>
invention includes selecting a data unit from a buffer, determining whether<br>
the data unit occupies a predetermined position within a transmission<br>
window, and transmitting polling information with the data unit if the data unit<br>
is determined to occupy the predetermined position within the transmission<br>
window. The predetermined position may be a last position of the<br>
transmission window or may be another position of the transmission window.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the method of the present<br>
invention includes sequentially selecting PDUs by the number requested by<br>
a lower layer in a transmission buffer in order to transmit the PDUs, checking<br><br>
whether a selected specific PDU is the last PDU in the transmission buffer,<br>
checking whether the selected specific PDU is the last PDU in a<br>
transmission window, and setting one or more polling bits in the<br>
corresponding PDU and transmitting the PDU to the receiver when it is<br>
determined that the selected specific PDU is the last PDU. The order of the<br>
checking steps may be varied.<br>
One variation of the invention includes first checking whether the<br>
selected PDU is the last PDU in a transmission buffer and then checking<br>
whether the selected PDU is the last PDU in a transmission window when it<br>
is determined that the selected PDU is not the last PDU in the transmission<br>
buffer. Another variation includes first checking whether the selected PDU is<br>
the last PDU in the transmission buffer and the checking whether the<br>
selected PDU is the last PDU in the transmission window. Preferably, PDUs<br>
are data units defined by a radio link control (RLC) layer such as a mobile<br>
terminal of a mobile communication system or a network apparatus.<br>
Whether a polling bit is set is checked may be determined by reflecting<br>
information of the transmission window and information on PDUs existing in<br>
the transmission buffer. A process of checking whether the transmitter<br>
performs polling to the receiver may be repeated every transmission time<br>
interval.<br>
The present invention is also a transmitter or a network apparatus<br>
configured to perform the method of the present invention. The transmitter is<br>
preferably included in a user terminal of a mobile communications system<br><br>
and in accordance with at least one embodiment includes a buffer and a<br>
polling information setting unit. The buffer may be a transmission buffer or a<br>
re-transmission buffer, or both may be included. In operation, the polling<br>
information setting unit determines whether a data unit selected from the<br>
buffer is a last data unit in a transmission window and then transmits polling<br>
information with the data unit if the data unit is determined to be the last data<br>
unit in the transmission window. If the data unit is not the last data unit in a<br>
transmission window, the polling information setting unit determines whether<br>
the data unit is a last data unit in the transmission buffer and then transmits<br>
polling information with the data unit if the data unit is determined to be the<br>
last data unit in the transmission buffer. If the data unit is not the last data<br>
unit in the transmission buffer, the polling information setting unit transmits<br>
the data unit without polling information.<br>
The polling information setting unit may perform a number of<br>
additional functions. These steps include determining whether another data<br>
unit selected from the transmission buffer is the last data unit in the<br>
transmission buffer, and then transmitting polling information with said<br>
another data unit if said another data unit is the last data unit in the<br>
transmission buffer. If the buffer is a re-transmission buffer, the polling<br>
information setting unit may perform the functions of determining whether<br>
the data unit has been previously transmitted and transmitting the polling<br>
information with the data unit if the data unit is determined to be the last data<br>
unit among the re-transmitted data units in the transmission window.<br><br>
The present invention is also a method for manufacturing a terminal<br>
or network apparatus as previously described.<br>
The present invention is also a computer program including code<br>
sections for implementing the steps of the method of the present invention.<br>
The program may be stored in a computer-readable medium included within<br>
or interface to a terminal or network apparatus.<br>
The present invention represents a significant improvement over<br>
conventional methods at least in part because of the polling triggers used in<br>
its various embodiments. Through these polling triggers, the present<br>
invention avoids transmission delays generated by conventional polling<br>
triggers. This results in a substantial increase in speed, efficiency, and<br>
quality of communications. This improved performance further allows user<br>
terminals to meet or exceed the standards required by next-generation<br>
mobile communications systems including so-called 3GPP wireless<br>
systems.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be<br>
set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become<br>
apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the<br>
following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objects and<br>
advantages of the invention may be realized and attained as particularly<br>
pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

MOPES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is a system and method for preventing a<br>
deadlock condition from occurring in a communications system. The<br>
invention is preferably implemented in a mobile communications system<br>
such as the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) currently<br>
being developed by the third-generation partnership project (3GPP). Those<br>
skilled in the art can appreciate, however, that the invention may<br>
alternatively be adapted for use in communications systems which operate<br>
according to other standards. The present invention is also a transmitter<br>
which implements the method of the present invention for preventing a<br>
deadlock condition from occurring. The present invention is also a computer<br>
program which may be stored in a transmitter for implementing the method<br>
of the present invention. A detailed discussion of embodiments of the<br>
invention will now be provided.<br>
The invention is ideally suited for use in a specific layer of a<br>
communications protocol which is adapted for operation within a UMTS<br>
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN). The layer may be a data link<br>
layer of the protocol, and when implemented in this manner may correspond<br>
to at least the radio link control (RLC) layer. Lower layers of this protocol are<br>
generally shown in Figure 1, a detailed discussion of which has been<br><br>
previously provided. Preferably, the invention is applied within an RLC layer<br>
operating in the acknowledged mode (AM). Those skilled in the art can<br>
appreciate, however, that the invention may also be applied in other contexts.<br>
For example, the radio link protocol (RLP) layer of a radio communication<br>
system in accordance with the present invention may be adapted to operate<br>
according to a CDMA 2000 standard.<br>
Figure 6 is a diagram showing a transmitter 200 in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention which transmits protocol data units<br>
using an RLC layer preferably operating in AM mode. The transmitter<br>
includes a PDU generator 201, a transmission buffer 202, a re-transmission<br>
buffer 203, and a polling bit setting unit 204. The transmitter may be included<br>
in any one of a variety of forms of user equipment, including but not limited to<br>
a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant, a so-called pocket PC, a<br>
laptop or notebook computer, or any other device which receives signals<br>
wirelessly transmitted over a mobile communications network.<br>
The PDU generator receives data units (e.g., SDUs) from an upper<br>
protocol layer and then segments or concatenates these SDUs in order form<br>
PDUs of a uniform size. The PDUs may be formed by adding an RLC header<br>
to each segment. A sequence number is preferably included in the header<br>
for the purpose of classifying or otherwise identifying the PDU. The<br>
sequence number may be a transmission sequence number for allowing a<br>
receiver to perform in-sequence processing of PDUs sent from the<br>
transmitter.<br><br>
The transmission buffer stores the PDUs output from generator 201.<br>
These PDUs are sequentially delivered to a lower protocol layer based on a<br>
sequence number requested by the lower layer every transmission time<br>
interval (TTI). The lower layer then transmits the PDUs to a receiver through<br>
a radio interface. In the receiver, an AM RLC layer forms SDUs from the<br>
received PDUs based on information in the PDU headers. The resulting<br>
SDUs are then delivered to an upper protocol layer of the receiver for further<br>
processing.<br>
The re-transmission buffer also stores the PDUs output from<br>
generator 201. Unlike the transmission buffer, however, the purpose of the<br>
re-transmission buffer is to enable a transmitted PDU to be re-transmitted in<br>
the event it was not successfully received by the receiver.<br>
The re-transmission buffer operates in accordance with status<br>
information from the receiver. More specifically, when polling information is<br>
set in a received PDU, the receiver AM RLC checks whether this and<br>
preceding PDUs have been correctly received. The preceding PDUs may be<br>
checked back to the last PDU that was received containing polling<br>
information. At the conclusion of this check, the receiver transmits status<br>
information to the transmitter indicating the PDUs that were and were not<br>
successfully received.<br>
The transmitter AM RLC deletes PDUs from the re-transmission<br>
buffer indicated to have been successfully received by the status information.<br>
PDUs that were not successfully received are output from the re-<br><br>
transmission buffer and re-transmitted. A negative acknowledgment (NACK)<br>
signal may be included in the status information for indicating that a PDU<br>
was not successfully received. Re-transmitted PDUs may be left in the re-<br>
transmission buffer until the transmission is successful, or alternatively until<br>
the PDU has been re-transmitted a predetermined number of times. When<br>
either of these events occurs, the PDU may be deleted from the re-<br>
transmission buffer. Re-transmitted PDUs may be given priority over first-<br>
transmitted PDUs if desired.<br>
Polling bit setting unit 204 determines whether to send polling<br>
information with a protocol data unit output from the transmission buffer. The<br>
polling bit setting unit performs this function based on whether the protocol<br>
data unit is a last data unit in a transmission buffer, a last data unit in a<br>
transmission window, or both. As previously discussed, if polling information<br>
is included with a PDU, upon detection the receiver will send back status<br>
information to the transmitter AM RLC indicating whether this and preceding<br>
PDUs were successfully received. The polling information may be in the form<br>
of one or more bits set in a dedicated field of a PDU header. If desired,<br>
polling information may be included with re-transmitted PDUs.<br>
The status information sent by the receiver back to the transmitter in<br>
response to polling information controls the movement of a transmission<br>
window used to transmit PDUs to the receiver. The transmission window has<br>
a size which preferably corresponds to a predetermined maximum number<br>
of PDUs that can be transmitted. A least a lower limit (or position) of this<br><br>
window may be set (or updated) based on the status information from the<br>
receiver. The transmission window is moved based on status information<br>
indicating that PDUs have been successfully received. Movement of the<br>
window may be stopped, however, when status information is received<br>
indicating that a PDU has not been successfully received. When this occurs,<br>
this PDU may be re-transmitted (with or without polling information) until<br>
subsequent status information indicates that the re-transmitted PDU has<br>
been successfully received. The transmission window may then be moved<br>
so that additional PDUs to enable additional PDUs from the transmission<br>
buffer to be loaded. An example of the manner in which transmission window<br>
movement is updated and how a reception window in the receiver moves<br>
was previously described.<br>
Figure 7 shows steps included in one embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention. The method is preferably implemented by the AM RLC<br>
transmitter such as shown in Figure 6, and according to at least one aspect<br>
addresses the manner in which polling information is assigned to PDUs<br>
output from the transmission and for re-transmission buffers. More<br>
specifically, the present invention advantageously controls the transmission<br>
of polling information with PDUs based on a polling trigger which allows the<br>
invention to outperform conventional methods in terms of speed, efficiency,<br>
and accuracy of communications.<br>
An initial step of the method includes selecting a protocol data unit<br>
from a plurality of PDUs stored in the transmission buffer. (Block 301). As<br><br>
previously described, this buffer may be loaded based on PDUs output from<br>
generator 201. These PDUs are preferably stored in order of a<br>
predetermined transmission sequence and consequently may have<br>
consecutive transmission sequence numbers. Selection of data units is<br>
preferably performed within corresponding transmission time intervals.<br>
A second step of the method includes determining whether the<br>
selected protocol data unit is a last data unit in a transmission window.<br>
(Block 302). The transmission window used by the AM RLC of the<br>
transmitter has a predetermined size for holding a maximum number of<br>
PDUs. For example, the transmission window may have a range of 100<br>
PDUs positions. In this case, the PDU corresponding to the 100lh position of<br>
the window corresponds to the last data unit of the window. The last PDU in<br>
the transmission window constitutes the polling trigger for this embodiment<br>
of the present invention. As will be discussed in greater detail, setting the<br>
polling trigger to this PDU represents a significant improvement in the art<br>
because it allows the invention to avoid a deadlock condition caused by<br>
conventional polling techniques.<br>
A third step of the method includes transmitting the selected PDU<br>
based on the outcome of the second step. If the selected PDU corresponds<br>
to the last PDU in the transmission window, the AM RLC of the transmitter<br>
delivers polling information with the PDU to a lower protocol layer of the<br>
transmitter. The PDU may then be transmitted with the polling information to<br>
the receiver. (Block 303). The polling information may be in the form of one<br><br>
or more polling bits which are preferably stored in a dedicated field of a<br>
header of the PDU. Alternatively, the polling information may be appended<br>
to or otherwise transmitted with the PDU to the receiver.<br>
Once the receiver receives the polling information, status information<br>
is sent back to the transmitter. This status information preferably indicates<br>
whether the PDU transmitted with the polling information was successfully<br>
received by the receiver, and whether preceding PDUs back to the last PDU<br>
transmitted with polling information were successfully received. The<br>
transmission window may then be updated based on the status information<br>
sent from the receiver. (Block 304). This may include moving the position of<br>
the transmission window so that the lower limit (position) of the window<br>
corresponds to a PDU that was unsuccessfully received. At this point, the<br>
unsuccessfully received PDUs may be output from the re-transmission buffer<br>
and re-transmitted. The re-transmitted PDUs may be given priority in the<br>
transmission window.<br>
If the selected PDU does not correspond to the last PDU in the<br>
transmission window, the AM RLC of the transmitter may deliver the PDU to<br>
a lower protocol layer without polling information. (Block 305). The PDU may<br>
then be transmitted to the receiver. The method may then continue by<br>
selecting the next in-sequence PDU within the range of the transmission<br>
window.<br>
Setting the polling trigger of an AM RLC transmitter to the last PDU of<br>
a transmission window allows the invention to prevent a deadlock condition<br><br>
from occurring between the transmitter and receiver. This may be<br>
understood first with reference to the manner in which conventional systems<br>
operate.<br>
Related systems use a polling trigger which is based on the last PDU<br>
stored in the transmission buffer, as previously discussed. When the number<br>
of PDUs stored in the transmission buffer is greater than the size of the<br>
transmission window, the last PDU position in the transmission window may<br>
not correspond to the last PDU stored in the transmission buffer. The last<br>
PDU in the transmission window will therefore be transmitted without polling<br>
information. This will stagnate movement of the transmission window in the<br>
transmitter and ultimately the reception window in the receiver, thereby<br>
placing the transmitter and receiver in a deadlocked condition. This may be<br>
understood with reference to the following example.<br>
Consider the case where the size of the transmission window is 100<br>
PDU positions and PDU Nos. 1 through 150 are stored in the transmission<br>
buffer. When the last PDU in the transmission window (e.g., PDU No. 100) is<br>
selected, a check will be performed to determine whether the polling<br>
condition is satisfied. In conventional systems, polling is triggered when the<br>
selected PDU corresponds to the last PDU stored in the transmission buffer.<br>
Since the PDU No. 100 does not correspond to the last PDU stored in the<br>
transmission buffer (e.g., PDU No. 150), polling information will not be set in<br>
PDU No. 100 when it is transmitted to the receiver.<br><br>
Because polling information is not transmitted with PDU No. 100, the<br>
receiver will not send status information back to the transmitter, since the<br>
receiver will only perform this function when polling information is included<br>
with a received PDU. Consequently, the transmitter will not receive status<br>
information in response to transmission of PDU No. 100. As previously<br>
discussed, the transmission window is updated (i.e., moves) in response to<br>
positive status information, i.e., information indicating that previously<br>
transmitted PDUs have been successfully received. Under these conditions,<br>
it is clear that even though the PDU may have been successfully received,<br>
the transmission window will not be updated because no status information<br>
is sent back from the transmitter. As a result, the transmission window will<br>
not move to transmit the remaining fifty PDUs in the transmission buffer,<br>
which means that the receiver will no longer receive any additional PDUs.<br>
Thus, for all practical purposes, the transmitter and receiver are placed in an<br>
inoperative state, which has come to be known as deadlock.<br>
The present invention operates using a polling trigger that<br>
advantageously makes deadlock impossible. The polling trigger used in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment of the invention is the last PDU in the<br>
transmission window. When a polling trigger of this type is used, the<br>
invention will ensure that status information is sent back from the receiver<br>
regardless of whether the number of PDUs stored in the transmission buffer<br>
is greater than the size of the transmission window. To illustrate, in the<br>
above example, when PDU No. 100 is selected for transmission from the<br><br>
transmission buffer, a check performed by the polling bit setting unit 204<br>
determines that it is the last PDU in the transmission window. As a result, the<br>
polling bit setting unit transmits polling information with PDU No. 100.<br>
The receiver detects the polling information and sends back status<br>
information indicating the state of reception of PDU No. 100 and all<br>
preceding PDUs back to the last PDU that was received with polling<br>
information. The transmission window is updated based on the status<br>
information, and as a result the remaining fifty PDUs (i.e., PDU Nos. 101-<br>
150) may be transmitted from the buffer to the receiver. Also, since the<br>
transmitter continues to transmit, the receiver remains operative. As a result,<br>
the deadlock condition is completely avoided. In this example, polling<br>
information may also be transmitted with the last PDU with the transmission<br>
buffer, which in this case is PDU No. 150.<br>
The method of the present invention may include at least one optional<br>
step. This optional step includes determining whether the selected data unit<br>
has been previously transmitted. This step may be performed based on<br>
status information sent back from the receiver. For example, consider the<br>
case where PDU Nos. 1 through 100 were transmitted using a transmission<br>
window with 100 positions, and that the last PDU was transmitted with<br>
polling information. Consider further that status information sent back from<br>
the receiver indicates that PDU Nos. 50, 72, and 80 were not successfully<br>
received. In this case, the first three positions may be dedicated to re-<br>
transmitting PDU Nos 50, 72, and 80 and the transmission window may be<br><br>
updated so that the first 50 PDUs to be transmitted corresponds to new PDU<br>
Nos. 101 - 149 for the first time. Given this set of circumstances, the method<br>
may further include detecting that PDU Nos. 50, 72, and 80 need to be re-<br>
transmitted and then further detecting that PDU No. 80 is the last PDU<br>
among the re-transmitted PDUs in the transmission window. When this<br>
occurs, a polling request may be set in PDU No. 80 and this PDU may then<br>
be re-transmitted to the receiver. And the polling information may also be<br>
transmitted with the last PDU in the transmission window, in this case PDU<br>
No. 149, only if the PDU is determined to be the last data unit in the<br>
transmission window and the PDU has not been previously transmitted.<br>
Figure 8 shows steps included in a second embodiment of the method<br>
of the present invention. This second embodiment is similar to the first<br>
embodiment except that it is performed based on one of two polling triggers,<br>
the first being that a selected PDU is the last PDU in a transmission window<br>
and the second being that the selected PDU is the last PDU in a<br>
transmission buffer. This method may be performed as follows.<br>
In an initial step, a PDU is selected from the transmission buffer<br>
during a transmission time interval. (Block 401). A check is then performed<br>
to determine whether the selected PDU corresponds to the last PDU in the<br>
transmission buffer. (Block 402). If the selected PDU is the last PDU in the<br>
transmission buffer, a polling bit is set in the selected PDU (Block 403) and<br>
the PDU is then transmitted to the receiver (Block 404). If the selected PDU<br>
is not the last PDU in the transmission buffer, a second check is performed<br><br>
to determine whether it is the last PDU in the transmission window. (Block<br>
405). If the selected PDU is the last PDU in the transmission window, the<br>
polling bit is set and the PDU is transmitted to the receiver. If the selected<br>
PDU is not the last PDU in the transmission buffer or the transmission<br>
window, the PDU is transmitted to the receiver without polling information.<br>
The method then waits for the next transmission time interval (Block 406)<br>
and another PDU is selected. If desired, one or more of the PDUs may be<br>
selected from the re-transmission buffer. Polling information may be<br>
transmitted with this PDU If one of the trigger conditions is satisfied.<br>
Figure 9 is a diagram showing the setting of a polling bit in a selected<br>
PDU (e.g., PDU No. 150) when this PDU corresponds to the last PDU in the<br>
transmission buffer. More specifically, this diagram shows the case where<br>
the transmission window includes 160 positions and PDU Nos. 1 through<br>
150 are stored in the transmission buffer. Because the number of PDUs<br>
stored in the transmission buffer is less than the number of positions of the<br>
transmission window, the polling bit is set for PDU No. 150, which is the last<br>
PDU in the transmission buffer.<br>
Figure 10 is a diagram showing the setting of a polling bit in a<br>
selected PDU (e.g., PDU No. 100) when the PDU is the last PDU in a<br>
transmission window. More specifically, this diagram shows the case where<br>
the transmission window includes 100 positions and PDU Nos. 1 through<br>
150 are stored in the transmission buffer, i.e., the number of positions of the<br>
transmission window is less than the number of PDUs stored in the<br><br>
transmission buffer. Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the<br>
present invention, PDU No. 100 is set with a polling bit even though it is not<br>
the last PDU stored in the transmission buffer.<br>
Figure 11 shows steps included in a third embodiment of the method<br>
of the present invention. The third embodiment is similar to the second<br>
embodiment except that a check to determine whether a selected PDU is the<br>
last PDU in a transmission window (Block 502) is performed before a check<br>
to determine whether the selected PDU is a last PDU in a transmission<br>
buffer (Block 505).<br>
The present invention is also a computer program which includes<br>
sections of code for performing steps included in the various embodiment of<br>
the method of the present invention. The computer program may be written<br>
in any computer language and may be stored on a permanent or removable<br>
computer-readable medium within or interfaced to a user terminal in which<br>
the transmission buffer is located. Permanent computer-readable mediums<br>
Include but are not limited to read-only memories and random-access<br>
memories. Removable mediums include but are not limited to EPROMs,<br>
EEPROMs, any one of a number of so-called memory sticks or cards, smart<br>
cards, computer cards, or any other type of removable storage medium.<br>
Flash memories may also be used to store the computer program of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In all the embodiments of the method of the present invention, the<br>
polling setting unit of the user terminal shown in Figure 6 may perform steps<br><br>
of determining whether a selected PDU is a last PDU in the buffers or<br>
transmission window, as well as other processing steps.<br>
Also, the method of the present invention has been described as<br>
controlling the setting of a polling bit in accordance with a transmission<br>
window having a predetermined size. This size may correspond to a<br>
predetermined maximum size of the window, or the window may be set to<br>
some limit less than the maximum size if desired.<br>
Also, in many of the embodiments of the invention the polling trigger<br>
is based on the last PDU in the transmission window. Those skilled in the art<br>
can appreciate that, if desired, the polling trigger may be set to a PDU which<br>
does not correspond to the last PDU in the transmission window. For<br>
example, it may be desired to allocate one or more positions in the window<br>
to a special type of PDU, such as re-transmitted PDUs. Under these<br>
circumstances, the polling trigger may be set to correspond to the last first-<br>
transmitted PDU in the transmission window or the last re-transmitted PDU<br>
in the transmission window. The polling trigger may be set by an upper<br>
protocol layer, and may be dynamically changed throughout operation of the<br>
transmitter based on control information from an upper layer, or may be<br>
based on pre-stored information in the transmitter.<br>
It is noted that the present invention has been adopted in 3GPP<br>

in a transmission window,<br>
- determine whether the data unit has been previously transmitted, and<br>
- transmit polling information with the data unit, in the event of the data unit being<br>
determined to be the last data unit in the transmission window and the data unit<br>
having not been previously transmitted.<br>
22. The terminal as claimed in claim 21, wherein the buffer is a transmission<br>
buffer (202).<br>
23. The terminal as claimed in claim 22, wherein, in the event of the data unit<br>
being not the last data unit in the transmission window, the polling information<br>
setting unit (204) is adapted to :<br><br>
- determine whether the data unit is a last data unit in the transmission buffer<br>
(202); and<br>
- in the event of the data unit being determined to be the last data unit in the<br>
transmission buffer (202) and the data unit having not been previously<br>
transmitted, transmit polling information with the data unit.<br>
24. The terminal as claimed in claim 23, wherein in the event of the data unit<br>
being not the last data unit in the transmission buffer (202), the polling<br>
information setting unit is adapted to transmit the data unit without the polling<br>
information.<br>
25. The terminal as claimed in claim 21, wherein the polling information setting<br>
unit (204) is adapted to operate in a radio link control RLC protocol layer.<br>
26. The terminal as claimed in claim 25, wherein the radio link control RLC<br>
protocol layer is adapted to operate in acknowledge mode AM.<br>
27. The terminal as claimed in claim 21, wherein the polling information setting<br>
unit (204) is adapted to set the polling information in a predetermined field of the<br>
data unit.<br>
28. A method for manufacturing a transmitter for use in a communications<br>
system, comprising the steps of:<br>
- providing a buffer (202); and<br>
- providing a polling information setting unit (204) in communication with the<br>
buffer (202);<br>
wherein the polling information setting unit (204) is provided with<br><br>
- means for determining whether a data unit selected from the buffer (202) is a<br>
last data unit in a transmission window,<br>
- means for detecting whether the data unit has been previously transmitted, and<br>
- means for transmitting polling information with the data unit in the event of the<br>
data unit being determined to be the last data unit in the transmission window<br>
and the data unit having not been previously transmitted.<br>
A method for controlling the transmission of signals in a<br>
communications system uses a polling trigger which prevents a<br>
deadlock condition from occurring between a transmitter and<br>
receiver. The method includes selecting a protocol data unit (PDU)<br>
from a buffer, determining whether the data unit is located at a last<br>
position within a transmission window, and then transmitting polling<br>
information with the data unit if the data unit is located at the last<br>
position of the transmission window. If the data unit is not in a last<br>
position of the transmission window, additional steps of the method<br>
include determining whether the data unit is a last-stored data unit in<br>
a transmission buffer (202). If so, polling information is transmitted<br>
with the data unit. If neither polling trigger is satisfied, the data unit is<br>
transmitted.</td>
