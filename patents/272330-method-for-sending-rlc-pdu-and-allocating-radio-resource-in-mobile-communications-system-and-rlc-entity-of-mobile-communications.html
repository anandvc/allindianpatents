METHOD FOR SENDING RLC PDU AND ALLOCATING<br>
RADIO RESOURCE IN MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
AND RLC ENTITY OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional Applications<br>
Nos. 61/025,311 and 61/026,119 respectively filed on February 1, 2008 and February<br>
4, 2008 and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0007152 filed on January 29,<br>
2009 in Republic of Korea. The entire contents of these applications are herein fully<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[2] The present invention relates to a radio protocol in a mobile communications system,<br>
and more particularly, a method in which MAC and RLC layers in a long term<br>
evolution (LTE) system sends RLC STATUS PDUs using a limited radio resource.<br>
Background Art<br>
[3] FIG. 1 is a network architecture of a long term evolution (LTE) system which is the<br>
related art mobile communication system has evolved from the existent UMTS system<br>
and a basic standardization therefor is undergoing in 3GPP.<br>
[4] The LTE network may be divided into evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access<br>
network (E-UTRAN) and core network (CM). The E-UMTS includes a terminal<br>
(User Equipment; UE), a base station (Evolved Mode B; eNB), an access gateway<br>
(aGW) located at the end of the network to be connected to an external network. The<br>
aGW may be divided into a portion of handling a user traffic and a portion of<br>
processing a control traffic. Here, a new interface may be used for the communication<br>
between the aGW for processing the user traffic and the aGW for processing the<br>
control traffic. One or more cells may exist in one eNB. An interface for transmission<br>
of the user traffic or control traffic may be used between eNBs. The CN may include<br>
an aGW, a node for a user registration of other UEs and the like. An interface may be<br>
used to identify the E-UTRAN and CN.<br>
[5] FIG. 2 is an architecture of a radio interface protocol control plane between a<br>
terminal and an E-UTRAN based upon the 3GPP radio access network standard, and<br>
FIG. 3 is an architecture of a radio interface protocol user plane between a terminal and<br>
an E-UTRAN based upon the 3GPP radio access network standard.<br>
[6] Hereinafter, the architecture of radio interface protocols between the terminal and the<br>
E-UTRAN will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
[7] The radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a physical layer, a data<br>
link layer and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising a user plane for<br>
transmitting data information and a control plane for transmitting a control signaling.<br>
The protocol layers can be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a<br>
third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an Open System Interconnection (OSI)<br>
standard model widely known in communications systems. Such radio interface<br>
protocols may exist as a pair between the terminal and the E-UTRAN, to manage data<br>
transmissions over interfaces.<br>
[8] Hereinafter, each layer in the radio protocol control plane in Fig. 2 and the radio<br>
protocol user plane in Fig. 3 will be described.<br>
[9] A first layer, as a physical (PHY) layer, provides an information transfer service to<br>
an upper layer using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected to its upper<br>
layer, called a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel. The<br>
MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the transport channel. Here, the<br>
transport channels may be divided into a dedicated transport channel and a common<br>
transport channel depending on whether the transport channel is shared. Data is<br>
transferred via a physical channel between different physical layers, namely, between<br>
the physical layer of a transmitting side and the physical layer of a receiving side.<br>
[10] Various layers exist in the second layer. First, a medium access control (MAC) layer<br>
serves to map different logical channels to different transport channels, and also<br>
performs a logical channel multiplexing for mapping several logical channels to one<br>
transport channel. The MAC layer is connected to an upper radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer via a logical channel. Logical channels are divided according to a type of in-<br>
formation to be transmitted into a control channel for transmitting control plane in-<br>
formation and a traffic channel for transmitting user plane information.<br>
[11] The RLC layer of the second layer manages segmentation and concatenation of data<br>
received from an upper layer to appropriately adjust a data size such that a lower layer<br>
can send data over an interface. Also, the RLC layer provides three operation modes,<br>
including a transparent mode (TM), an un-acknowledged mode (UM) and an ac-<br>
knowledged mode (AM), so as to guarantee various quality of service (QoS) re-<br>
quirements of each radio bearer (RB). In particular, the RLC layer operating in the AM<br>
mode (hereinafter, referred to as AM RLC layer) performs a retransmission using an<br>
automatic repeat and request (ARQ) function for a reliable data transmission.<br>
[12] A packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer located at the second layer is used<br>
to efficiently transmit IP packets, such as IPv4 or IPv6, on a radio interface with a<br>
relatively small bandwidth. For this purpose, the PDCP layer reduces the size of an IP<br>
packet header which is relatively great in size and includes unnecessary control in-<br>
formation, namely, performs a function called header compression. Accordingly, only<br>
necessary information can be included in the header part of data for transmission, so as<br>
to increase a transmission efficiency of a radio interface.<br>
[13] A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowermost portion of the third<br>
layer is only defined in the control plane. The RRC. layer controls logical channels,<br>
transport channels and physical channels in relation to configuration, re-configuration<br>
and release of Radio Bearers (RBs). Here, the RB denotes a logical path that the L2<br>
layer provides for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN. In general,<br>
the establishment of the RB refers to stipulating the characteristics of protocol layer<br>
and channel required for providing a specific service, and setting the respective<br>
detailed parameters and operation methods. The RBs are divided into a signaling RB<br>
(SRB) and a data RB (DRB). The SRB is used as a path for transmission of RRC<br>
messages in the C-plane, while the DRB is used as a path for transmissions of user data<br>
in the U-plane.<br>
[14] Hereinafter, the RLC layer will be described in more detail. The RLC layer provides<br>
three modes, such as the TM, UM and AM, as mentioned above. The RLC layer rarely<br>
performs a function in the TM, and thus UM and AM will only be described herein.<br>
The UM RLC adds a protocol data unit (PDU) header including a sequence number<br>
(SN) to each PDU for transmission, such that a receiving side can be known as to<br>
which PDU has been lost during transmission. Due to such function, the UM RLC<br>
manages, in the user plane, the transmission of multimedia data or the transmission of<br>
real-time packet data, such as voice (e.g., VoIP) or streaming in a packet service<br>
domain (hereinafter, referred to as a PS domain), while managing, in the control plane,<br>
the transmission of an RRC message, which does not need a reception acknowl-<br>
edgement, among RRC messages sent to a specific terminal or specific terminal group<br>
within a cell.<br>
[15] Similarly, the AM RLC constructs a PDU by adding a PDU header including an SN<br>
upon the construction of PDU. Unlike the UM RLC, a receiving side acknowledges a<br>
PDU sent by a transmitting side. The receiving side acknowledges in order to request a<br>
retransmission of unsuccessfully received PDU from the transmitting side. Such re-<br>
transmission function is the most important characteristic of the AM RLC. Thus, the<br>
AM RLC aims to guarantee an error-free data transmission via the retransmission.<br>
Under the purpose, the AM RLC usually manages a non-real-time packet data<br>
transmission, such as TCP/IP of PS domain, in the user plane, while managing a<br>
transmission of RRC message, which requires a reception acknowledgement, among<br>
RRC. messages transmitted to a specific terminal within a cell in the control plane.<br>
[16] From the perspective of direction, the. UM RLC is used for a uni-directional commu-<br>
nication, while the AM RLC is used for a bi-directional communication due to a<br>
feedback from a receiving side. From the structural perspective, there is a difference,<br>
namely, the UM RLC is configured such that one RLC entity performs transmission or<br>
reception while the AM RLC is configured such that both transmitting side and<br>
receiving side exist in one RLC entity, The complicated configuration of the AM RLC<br>
is due to the retransmission. The AM RLC includes a retransmission buffer for<br>
managing the retransmission, in addition to a transmission/reception buffer. Also, the<br>
AM RLC performs various functions, such as using transmitting and receiving<br>
windows for a flow control, polling for a transmitting side to request status information<br>
from a receiving side of an RLC entity, sending a status report for a receiving side to<br>
report its buffer state to a transmitting side of a peer RLC entity, constructing a status<br>
PDU for delivering status information, and the like. The AM RLC also needs various<br>
protocol parameters, such as status variables and a timer, in order to support the<br>
functions. A PDU, such as status report or status PDU, which is used for controlling<br>
the data transmission in the AM RLC, is referred to as 'Control PDU', and a PDU used<br>
for transferring user data is referred to as 'Data PDU'.<br>
[17] An RLC data PDU in the AM RLC may be divided into AMD PDU and AMD PDU<br>
segment, in detail. The AMD PDU segment has part of data included in the AMD<br>
PDU. In the LTE system, a maximum size of a data block is changeable every time a<br>
terminal sends the data block. Hence, after a transmitting side AM RLC entity<br>
constructs a 200-byte AMD PDU at a specific time and transmits the constructed AMD<br>
PDU, when the transmitting side AM RLC receives NACK from a receiving side AM<br>
RLC and thereby tries to retransmit the AMD PDU, if a maximum size of data block to<br>
be actually transmittable is 100 bytes, the same AMD PDU cannot be sent as it is. In<br>
this case, the AVID PDU segment is used. The AMD PDU segment denotes that the<br>
corresponding AMD PDU is segmented into smaller units. During the procedure, the<br>
transmitting side AM RLC entity divides the AMD PDU into the AMD PDU segments<br>
and transmits the AMD PDU segments over several transmission time intervals. The<br>
receiving side AM RLC entity then restores the AMD PDU from the received AMD<br>
PDU segments.<br>
[18] If there is unsuccessfully (incompletely or incorrectly) received data, the receiving<br>
side AM RLC requests a retransmission of such data from the transmitting side AM<br>
RLC, which is referred to as 'status report'. The status report is sent by using STATUS<br>
PDU, which is one of control PDUs.<br>
[19] FIG. 4 is a format of STATUS PDU currently used in the LTE system. In FIG. 4, a<br>
horizontal axis denotes a length of an RLC STATUS PDU with 8 bits, namely, 1 octet.<br>
[20] Each field of the RLC STATUS PDU will now be described.<br>
[21] 1. Data/Control (D/C) field : 1 bit<br>
[22] This field indicates whether a corresponding RLC PDU is either RLC data PDU or<br>
RLC control PDU.<br>
[23] 2. Control PDU type (CPT) field: 3 bits<br>
[24] This field indicates what type a corresponding control PDU is. The RLC control<br>
PDU currently defines only the STATUS PDU.<br>
[25] 3. Acknowledgement Sequence Number (ACK_SN)<br>
[26] Two types of ACK_SN will be defined as follows.<br>
[27] 1-1) A type of ACK_SN is an RLC SN of a first PDU whose information is not<br>
included in a STATUS PDU.<br>
[28] 1-2) Upon receiving the STATUS PDU, a transmitting side determines that all the<br>
PDUs among PDUs up to the PDU with ACK_SN-1 have successfully been received<br>
by a receiving side, excluding PDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NAC_SN or<br>
portions of PDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with N ACKJSN, SOstart and SOend.<br>
[29] Such ACK_SN was applied to embodiments of FIGS. 6 and 8 according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[30] 2-1) Another type of ACKJSN is an RLC SN of a first PDU whose information is<br>
included in a STATUS PDU.<br>
[31] 2-2) Upon receiving the STATUS PDU, the transmitting side determines that all the<br>
PDUs among PDUs up to the PDU with the ACK_SN have successfully been by the<br>
receiving side, excluding PDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NACK_SN or<br>
portions of PDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NACK_SN, SOstart and SOend.<br>
[32J Such ACK_SN was applied to embodiments of FIGS. 7 and 9 according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[33] 4. Extension 1 (E1): 1 bit<br>
[34] This indicates whether there is another NACKJSN element following a current<br>
NACK_SN element (i.e., indicated with NACK_SN or with NACK_SN, SOstart and<br>
SOend).<br>
[35] 5. NACK_SN (Negative acknowledgement Sequence Number)<br>
[36] This is an RLC SN of an unsuccessfully received AMD PDU or AMD PDU segment.<br>
[37] 5. Extension 2 (E2): 1 bit<br>
[38] This indicates whether there are SOstart and SOend fields corresponding to a current<br>
NACK_SN.<br>
[39] 6. Segment Offset Start (SOstart) and Segment Offset End (SOend)<br>
[40] These are used when only a part (segment) of PDU with NACK_SN is NACK. A<br>
first byte of the part corresponds to the SOstart and the last byte thereof corresponds to<br>
the SOend.<br>
[41] In the meantime, the receiving side AM RLC cannot always trigger a STATUS PDU,<br>
but can trigger a status reporting only when a specific condition is met. Such condition<br>
is referred to as 'status repotting trigger', and the LTE system currently uses two<br>
conditions as follows.<br>
[42] The first condition is a polling of a transmitting side.<br>
[43] That is, when desiring to receive a status report from a receiving side, the<br>
transmitting side AM RLC sets a poll bit for an RLC data PDU for transmission. The<br>
receiving side AM RLC then triggers the status report upon receiving the poll bit set<br>
RLC data PDU.<br>
[44] The second condition is a detection of an unsuccessful reception of RLC data PDU.<br>
[45] That is, upon detecting an unsuccessfully received RLC data PDU (i.e., AMD PDU<br>
or AMD PDU segment) after completing a HARQ reordering, the receiving side AM<br>
RLC triggers the status report.<br>
[46] In addition, when the status report is triggered, the receiving side AM RLC sends a.<br>
reception buffer state to the transmitting side using a STATUS PDU. Here, the<br>
STATUS PDU includes information up to the last PDU (=VR(MS)) among PDUs<br>
within the range of a PDU (=VR(R)) with a start point of a receiving window to a<br>
HARQ reordering completed PDU. Here, the VR(R) and VR(MS) denote state<br>
variables, which are managed by the receiving side AM RLC and used for a receiving<br>
window, a status report and the like. Among others, the receiving AM RLC manages<br>
additional state variables.<br>
[47] Such additional state variables of the receiving side AM RLC are described as<br>
follows.<br>
[48] - VR(R): Receive state variable.<br>
[49] • It hold a value of a sequence number (SN) of an AMD PDU subsequent to the last<br>
AMD PDU among AMD PDUs received in-sequence.<br>
[50] • It is a first AMD PDU among AMD PDUs which are not completely (successfully)<br>
received by the receiving side AM RLC.<br>
[51] • It serves as the lower edge of the receiving window.<br>
[52] • It is initially set to 0. When completely receiving an AMD PDU with SN=VR(R),<br>
it is updated to a value of SN of a first incompletely received AMD PDU subsequent to<br>
the AMD PDU.<br>
[53] - VR(MR): Maximum acceptable receive state variable.<br>
[54] • It holds a value of SN of the first AMD PDU among AMD PDUs outside a<br>
receiving window.<br>
[55] • It serves as the higher edge of the receiving window.<br>
[56] • It is updated, for example, to VR(MR)= VR(R) + AM_Window_size when the<br>
VR(R) is updated.<br>
[57] - VR(X): T_reordering state variable<br>
[58] • It holds a value of SN of an RLC data PDU subsequent to an RLC data PDU<br>
which triggered a T_reordering as a timer for managing a HARQ reordering.<br>
[59] • A receiving side AM RLC drives the T_reordering upon receiving an out-<br>
of-sequence RLC data PDU under a condition that no T_reordering is triggered, and<br>
sets the VR(X) to the value of SN of an RLC data PDU subsequent to the RLC data<br>
PDU.<br>
[60] - VR(MS): Maximum status transmit state variable<br>
[61] • This state variable is used for including in a STATUS PDU information only<br>
related to RLC data PDUs for which the HARQ reordering is completed.<br>
[62] • It is initially set to 0, and upon completely receiving an AMD PDU with<br>
SN=VR(MS), it is updated to a value of SN of a first incompletely received AMD<br>
PDU following the AMD PDU.<br>
[63] - Upon the T_recrdering expired, it is updated to a value of SN of a first in-<br>
completely received AMD PDU among AMD PDUs higher than VR(X). ACK_SN is<br>
set to the VR(MS) so as to construct a STATUS PDU.<br>
[64] - VR(H): highest received state variable<br>
[65] • It holds a value of the very next SN of the highest SN among RLC data PDUs<br>
received by the receiving side AM RLC, namely, a value of SN of an RLC data PDU<br>
which is first unsuccessfully received by the receiving side AM RLC.<br>
[66] • It is initially set to 0, and upon receiving an RLC data PDU higher than VR(H), it<br>
is updated to a value of SN of an RLC data PDU subsequent to the RLC data PDU.<br>
[67] Hereinafter, a logical channel prioritization (LCP) performed by the MAC layer will<br>
be described.<br>
[6S] When several radio bearers (RBs) are multiplexed and transmitted over one transport<br>
channel, an LTE terminal is configured such that its MAC layer decides an amount of<br>
transmission data for each RB, based upon the following rules, with respect to a given<br>
radio resource, for every transmission time interval (TTI).<br>
[69] 1. The MAC layer decides an amount of transmission data for multiplexed RBs in a<br>
decreasing order of each logical channel priority (LCP), and men decides a<br>
transmission amount as much as data corresponding to a maximum prioritized bit rate<br>
(PBR) for each RB.<br>
[70] 2, If any radio resources remain, the MAC layer decides the amount of transmission<br>
data for the multiplexed RBs in the decreasing order of each LCP.<br>
[71] Here, 1 to 8 LCPs are currently discussed, and 1 denotes the highest priority and 8<br>
denotes the lowest priority. PBR denotes a minimum bit rate guaranteed for a corre-<br>
sponding RB, which means that the LTE system can support such degree of bit rate<br>
even under a very bad radio environment. The PBR may be set within the range of 0 to<br>
infinity.<br>
[72] In the meantime. LCP and PBR of each RB are sent from a network RRC to a<br>
terminal RRC via an RB setup message upon initially setting the RB. After receiving<br>
the RB setup message, the terminal RRC then sets necessary RBs and sends in-<br>
formation on LCP and PBR of each RB to a terminal MAC. The MAC having received<br>
such information decides a transmission amount of each RB with respect to a given<br>
radio resource for every TTI, base, upon such rules.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[73] While performing a logical channel prioritization (LCP), the MAC considers only<br>
LCP and PBR. Therefore, it is possible that, for a certain logical channel, the allocated<br>
radio resource might be smaller than an RLC STATUS PDU to be sent via the corre-<br>
sponding logical channel. However, when a status report is triggered, a receiving side<br>
AM RLC is allowed to include all information related to AMD PDUs within a preset<br>
range into a STATUS PDU for transmission. Accordingly, if the radio resource to send<br>
the STATUS PDU is smaller than the STATUS PDU, the constructed STATUS PDU<br>
cannot be sent. The related art didn't consider such situation. As a result, such situation<br>
occurs, the constructed RLC STATUS PDU cannot be sent, thereby causing a deadlock<br>
situation.<br>
[74] Therefore, an object of the present invention is that, in case where a MAC layer<br>
performs a logical channel prioritization in order to allocate a radio resource to each<br>
logical channel, a MAC layer (MAC entity) is allowed to allocate a radio resource<br>
based upon the size of a RLC STATUS PDU to be sent from an RLC layer and the<br>
RLC layer is allowed to use a STATUS PDU prior :o RLC data PDU upon using the<br>
allocated radio resource, whereby RLC protocols can be prevented from coming in a<br>
deadlock due to an unsuccessful transmission of the STATUS PDU. To this end, the<br>
present invention proposes the operation of the MAC and the operation of the RLC, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
[75] To solve the problem of the related art, a method for transmitting radio link control<br>
(RLC) protocol data units (PDUs) in a mobile communications system, comprising:<br>
receiving an indication of available resource from a medium access control (MAC)<br>
entity; prioritizing transmission of RLC control PDUs over RLC data PDUs using the<br>
indication of available resource; and transmitting the prioritized RLC PDUs using the<br>
received available resource.<br>
[76] The method may further include allocating the available resource to the RLC control<br>
PDUs, and if any resource remains, then allocating the remaining resource to the RLC<br>
data PDUs.<br>
[77] The RLC control PDUs may denote RLC STATUS PDUs, and the method may<br>
further include if the available resource indicated from the MAC entity is smaller than<br>
the size of one status PDU, skipping by the RLC entity the transmission of one status<br>
PDU for this transmitting opportunity.<br>
[78] The available resource and the one status PDU may be checked for every<br>
transmission time interval (TTI).<br>
[79] The RLC control PDUs may denote RLC STATUS PDUs, and the method may<br>
further include checking by the RLC entity for every trans mission time interval (TTT)<br>
whether a STATUS PDU is scheduled for transmission, and if so, then informing the<br>
size of the STATUS PDU to the MAC entity.<br>
[80] In one aspect of the present invention, a method for allocating resources for<br>
transmission in a mobile communications system, may include: allocating the<br>
resources such that all logical channels are served in a decreasing priority order up to<br>
the size of each radio link control (RLC) STATUS protocol data unit (PDU) waking<br>
for transmission; if nay resources remain, allocating such remaining resources such<br>
that all the logical channels are served in a decreasing priority order up to their<br>
configured prioritized bit rate (PBR); and if any resources remain, allocating such<br>
remaining resources such that all the logical channels are served in a strictly decreasing<br>
priority order.<br>
[81] The method may further include: checking by a medium access control (MAC) entity<br>
whether a STATUS PDU is scheduled for transmission for every transmission time<br>
interval (TTI) in the RLC entity; and receiving information related to the size of the<br>
STATUS PDU if there is the STATUS PDU scheduled for transmission.<br>
[82] In another aspect of the present invention, a method for allocating resources in a<br>
mobile communications system, may include: allocating, by a medium access control<br>
(MAC) layer, resources such that all logical channels are served in a decreasing<br>
priority order up to each prioritized bit rate (PBR) of the logical channels plus the size<br>
of each RLC STATUS PDU waiting for transmission; and if any resources remain, al-<br>
locating, by the MAC entity, the remaining resource such that all the logical channels<br>
are served in a strict decreasing priority order.<br>
[83] The method may further include checking, by the MAC entity, whether a STATUS<br>
PDU is scheduled for transmission for every TTI in the RLC entity, and receiving in-<br>
formation related to the size of the STATUS PDU if the STATUS PDU is scheduled<br>
for transmission.<br>
[84] In one aspect of the present invention, a radio link control (RLC) entity in a mobile<br>
communications system may include a module configured to: receive an indication of<br>
resource from a medium access control (MAC) entity; check whether there is a<br>
STATUS PDU is scheduled to be sent to a peer RLC entity; compare the size of the<br>
indicated resource with the size of the STATUS PDU to be sent; primarily allocate the<br>
resource to the STATUS PDU so as to send the STATUS PDU to the peer RLC entity<br>
if the resource is larger than or equal to the STATUS PDU according to the<br>
comparison result; and skip the transmission of the STATUS PDU if the resource is<br>
smaller than the STATUS PDU according to the comparison result.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[85] The related art has not defined an operation method of a receiving side AM RLC<br>
when a radio resource is smaller than a STATUS PDU scheduled for transmission,<br>
which causes a deadlock situation of protocols. Therefore, the present invention allows<br>
a MAC layer to consider the size of a RLC STATUS PDU upon allocating resources<br>
and also allows an RLC layer to primarily allocate resources to a RLC STATUS PDU<br>
upon allocating resources, so as to enable a stable operation of protocols regardless of<br>
radio circumstances.<br>

the sake of brief description with reference to the drawings, the same or equivalent<br>
components regardless of reference numerals will be provided with the same reference<br>
numbers, and description thereof will not be repeated.<br>
[99] The present invention recognized the point that, for a certain logical channel, a<br>
STATUS PDU cannot be constructed if the allocated radio resource is smaller than a<br>
RLC STATUS PDU to be sent via the corresponding logical channel.<br>
[100] Considering such recognition, the present invention is conceptually characterized in<br>
that 1) in case where a MAC layer (MAC entity) performs a logical channel priori-<br>
tization in order to allocate a radio resource to each logical channel, 2) the MAC layer<br>
is allowed to allocate the radio resource based upon the size of a RLC STATUS PDU<br>
to be sent from the RLC layer, and also 3) the RLC layer is allowed to use the<br>
STATUS PDU prior to RLC data PDU upon using the allocated radio resource,<br>
whereby 4) the RLC protocols can be prevented from coining in a deadlock situation<br>
due to a non-transmission of the STATUS PDU.<br>
[101] First and second embodiments of the present invention illustrate an operation method<br>
in a MAC layer, and a third embodiment of the present invention illustrates an<br>
operation method in an RLC layer. In the embodiments of the present invention, a<br>
radio resource may briefly be referred to as 'resource', and also referred to as<br>
'transmitting resource' because it is used for the transmission of a STATUS PDU.<br>
[102] Also, in the first to third embodiments of the present invention, the STATUS PDU is<br>
sent from an RLC entity to a peer RLC entity. Thus, the STATUS PDU may denote an<br>
RLC STATUS PDU, and the two names, STATUS PDU and RLC STATUS PDU, are<br>
all used in the description of the present invention.<br>
[103] Hereinafter, the first embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
[104] When performing a logical channel prioritization (LCP) procedure, a MAC layer<br>
primarily considers, for each logical channel, the size of a STATUS PDU constructed<br>
by an RLC. That is, upon performing the LCP procedure, the MAC layer first<br>
considers the size, of RLC STATUS PDU of each logical channel in a decreasing<br>
priority order of each logical channel so as to allocate radio resources, and thereafter<br>
performs the related art LCP procedure.<br>
[105] The first embodiment of such procedure is described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
[106] FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a logical channel prioritization (LCP) of a MAC<br>
layer in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The LCP<br>
procedure of FIG. 5 is performed for every TTI.<br>
[107] Referring to FIG. 5, a MAC layer (or MAC entity) receives information related to the<br>
size of a RLC STATUS PDU (RLC STATUS PDU size information) from each RLC<br>
entity (S1). The MAC layer considers the RLC STATUS PDU size information<br>
received from each RLC entity so as to allocate radio resources to each logical channel<br>
in the decreasing order of each logical channel priority (S2).<br>
[108] If any radio resources remains (S3) after the allocation of radio resource to each<br>
logical channel at the step S2, then the remaining radio resource is allocated to each<br>
logical channel in the decreasing priority order up to their configured PBR (S4). After<br>
the step S4, if any radio resource remains, the remaining radio resource is allocated to<br>
data in the decreasing priority order (S6).<br>
[109] FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a logical channel prioritization (LCP) procedure of a<br>
MAC layer in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, which is<br>
another exemplary embodiment of the LCP procedure of the MAC layer. The LCP<br>
procedure of FIG. 6 is performed for every TTI. Comparing the second embodiment of<br>
FIG 6 with the first embodiment of FIG. 5, in the embodiment of FIG. 6, upon al-<br>
locating logical channels, the LCP procedure is performed based upon each STATUS<br>
PDU size and each PBR. That is, all the logical channels are allocated based upon each<br>
PER and each RLC STATUS PDU in the decreasing order of the logical channel<br>
priority.<br>
[110] Hereinafter, the LCP procedure according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
[111] The MAC layer (MAC entity) receives information related to the size of RLC<br>
STATUS PDU (RLC STATUS PDU size information) from each RLC entity (S11).<br>
The MAC layer then allocates radio resources to each logical channel in a decreasing<br>
priority order based upon the RLC STATUS PDU size information received from each<br>
RLC entity and each PBR (S12).<br>
[112] After the step S12, if any radio resource remains (S13), the MAC layer may further<br>
allocate the remaining resource to data in the decreasing priority order (S14).<br>
[113] In the meantime, in case of the first and second embodiments of the present<br>
invention, for each TTI, in order to consider the size of the RLC STATUS PDU of<br>
each logical channel during the LCP procedure, the RLC entity should inform the<br>
MAC layer of the size of the STATUS PDU scheduled for transmission.<br>
[114] As aforesaid, the first and second embodiments of the present invention illustrate that<br>
radio resources can be allocated to each logical channel based upon the RLC STATUS<br>
PDU size information, through the interaction between the RLC entity and the MAC<br>
layer. Therefore, in the present invention, the radio resources can be allocated to the<br>
STATUS PDU prior to data PDUs, such that the STATUS PDU can be sent prior to<br>
the data PDUs.<br>
[115] Hereinafter, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
[116] FIG, 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method for allocating radio resources based upon a<br>
size of STATUS PDU, performed by an RLC layer, in accordance with a third em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[117] For supporting the operation of the MAC, as illustrated in the first and second em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention, it should be checked for each TTI whether a<br>
STATUS PDU scheduled for transmission exists, and if so, the size of the corre-<br>
sponding STATUS PDU should be informed to the MAC. Such RLC-MAC interaction<br>
is required to allow the operarion method of the MAC.<br>
[118] However, unlike the above method, the RLC itself can be operated to avoid an RLC<br>
deadlock state. That is, when receiving information (indication) related to an available<br>
resource from the MAC layer, if the available resource is larger than or equal to the<br>
size of a STATUS PDU, the RLC entity may prioritize the STATUS PDU over RLC<br>
data PDUs for transmission. That is. the available resource is first allocated to the RLC<br>
STATUS PDU, and if any resource remains, such remaining resource is allocated to<br>
the RLC data PDUs.<br>
[119] Also, if the available resource indicated from the MAC is smaller than the STATUS<br>
PDU, the RLC entity may not send the STATUS PDU (i.e., skip the transmission of<br>
the STATUS PDU) for this transmitting opportunity. Tn other words, the RLC entity<br>
may send the STATUS PDU in the earliest transmitting opportunity, namely, when the<br>
available resource is larger than or equal to the size of the STATUS PDU.<br>
[120] Still referring to FIG. 7, the RLC entity receives an indication of an available<br>
resource from the MAC layer (S21). If the size of the received available, resource is<br>
larger than or equal to the size of the STATUS PDU (S22), the RLC entity primarily<br>
allocates the resource to the RLC STATUS PDU (S23). After allocating the resource to<br>
the STATUS PDU, if any resource remains, the RLC entity then allocates the<br>
remaining resource to the RLC data PDU (S24). However, if the size of the radio<br>
resource is smaller than the size of the STATUS PDU (S22), the RLC entity skips the<br>
transmission of the RLC STATUS PDU for this transmitting opportunity. Afterwards,<br>
the RLC entity checks the size of radio resource for every TTI, so as to send the<br>
STATUS PDU when the size of the resource is larger than the STATUS PDU (S25).<br>
[121] Hereinafter, an RLC entity according to the present invention will be described.<br>
[122] An RLC entity according to the present invention may be a device including a<br>
module configured to receive an indication of radio resource from a MAC layer, check<br>
whether a STATUS PDU is scheduled to be sent to a peer RLC entity; compare the<br>
size of the received radio resource with the size of the STATUS PDL1 scheduled for<br>
transmission, primarily allocate the radio resource to the STATUS PDU so as to send<br>
the STATUS PDU to the peer RLC entity if the radio resource is larger than or equal to<br>
the STATUS PDU according to the comparison result, and skip the transmission of the<br>
STATUS PDU if the radio resource is smaller than the STATUS PDU according to the<br>
comparison result. In the meantime, the module may include a plurality of components<br>
according to its function. That is, the module may include a receiving unit for receiving<br>
radio resource, a comparing unit for comparing the size of the radio resource with the<br>
size of the STATUS PDU scheduled for transmission, and a transmitting unit for<br>
transmitting the STATUS PDU. Therefore, the module may be implemented in various<br>
types of components each capable of performing its function.<br>
[123] The RLC entity according to the present invention basically includes, in addition to<br>
the aforesaid component, software and hardware required for implementing the scope<br>
of the present invention, for example, an output device (e.g., display, speaker and the<br>
like), an input device (e.g., keypad, microphone and the like), a memory, a transceiver<br>
(e.g., RF module, antenna and the like). Such components can be obviously understood<br>
by those skilled in the art, and thus a detailed description thereof will not be repeated.<br>
[124] Meanwhile, the method according to the present invention, as described so far, can<br>
be implemented by hardware or software, or any combination thereof. For example,<br>
the method according to the present invention may be stored in a storage medium (e.g.,<br>
an internal memory of a mobile terminal, a flash memory, a hard disc, etc.). Alter-<br>
natively, the method according to the present invention can be implemented as codes<br>
or command words within a software program capable of being executed by a<br>
processor (e.g., a microprocessor in a mobile terminal).<br>
[125] The. present invention has been explained with reference to the embodiments which<br>
are merely exemplary. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modi-<br>
fications and equivalent other embodiments can be made in the present invention<br>
without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Also, it will be understood<br>
that the present invention can be implemented by selectively combining the afore-<br>
mentioned embodiment(s) entirely or partially. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
