				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to technical plans for manufacturing and other<br>
processes and more particularly to a method of and a system for automatically<br>
constructing a technical plan.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In providing products or services, there are typically many requirements that<br>
must be met to produce products and services that meet expectations. Some<br>
examples of such requirements include specification requirements that apply to<br>
component manufacture or repair, standard design requirements that apply to a<br>
specific design activity, and quality requirements that apply to a specific<br>
manufacturing or repair process.<br>
To insure that a process (be it a manufacturing, repair or similar process) as<br>
practiced conforms to the applicable requirements, engineering specifications<br>
often require that a technical plan be made for the process. A technical plan is<br>
an overview of a process that sets forth what the process is, how it will be<br>
performed, what quality controls will be used, and how various requirements<br>
from the drawings and/or specification will be met.<br>
Currently, a user must manually develop a technical plan for each process.<br>
However, the quantity and quality of information provided is generally not<br>
standardized among users, and individual users tend to develop unique formats.<br>
This can result in variability wherein some technical plans are incomplete or<br>
otherwise insufficient. Variability in technical plans can be particularly<br>
troublesome where an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) process<br>
components manufactured by various suppliers. In this case, the supplier of a<br>
particular part will typically generate a proposed technical plan that is submitted<br>
to the OEM for review. The OEM will either approve the technical plan as<br>
submitted or request changes until a final technical plan is developed. Because<br>
suppliers differ in approach to writing technical plans, many reviews and<br>
revisions are usually needed before a final technical plan is accepted. The current<br>
approach thus results in lost productivity and increased costs.<br>
US 6223093 discloses a system and method for verifying process procedures in a<br>
manufacturing environment in a process procedure verifying system for the<br>
manufacturing of a semiconductor device, a process procedure inputted through<br>
an input and display device and stored in a temporary memory, is verified by<br>
using a knowledge data prepared on the basis of data stored in a product<br>
information memory and an equipment information memory. Thus, the process<br>
procedure can be verified with no intervention of experience and perception of a<br>
human being, and without concentrating a load to a limited equipment, with the<br>
result that production efficiency and reliability can be elevated.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a system and method of developing<br>
technical plans that avoid the problems of the current approach.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above-mentioned need is met by the present invention, which provides a system<br>
and method of using at least one computer to construct a technical plan for a specific<br>
process. The invention includes providing a rule-based logic model for the specific<br>
process and inputting data relating to the specific process. The data is compared to<br>
the logic model to identify exceptions in the data to rules in the logic model. The data<br>
are formatted into a technical plan that includes the exceptions. The technical plan is<br>
then outputted for review.<br>
The present invention and its advantages over the prior art will become apparent upon<br>
reading the following detailed description and the appended claims with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The subject matter that is regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and<br>
distinctly claimed in the concluding part of the specification. The invention, however,<br>
may be best understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawing figures in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a computer-based system for automatically constructing<br>
technical plans.<br>
Figure 2 graphically illustrates a user interface screen displaying a first input screen.<br>
Figure 3 graphically illustrates a user interface screen displaying a second input<br>
screen.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes a computer-based system for automatically<br>
constructing technical plans. In one preferred embodiment, the computer-based<br>
system includes a computer program, referred to herein as the logic processing<br>
software, that is configured to accept pertinent data inputs from a user and then<br>
automatically construct a technical plan that is appropriate to the particular situation<br>
as identified by the user's inputs.<br>
Prior to using the system, the user first obtains any documentation that is to be used in<br>
generating the technical plan. By way of example, documents such as a part's<br>
engineering specifications and drawings would be used when devising a process for<br>
manufacturing the part. Once the appropriate documents have been obtained, the user<br>
is ready to access the system. As will be described in more detail below, the system<br>
can be accessed in a variety of manners, such as via the Internet or locally via software<br>
resident on the user's computer or storage media such as a floppy disk or CD-ROM.<br>
Upon access to the system, the user is presented with one or more input screens. The<br>
input screens prompt the user for information that describes the particular process<br>
and/or part with which the user is dealing. For example, the information provided by<br>
the user could include part number, part name, manufacturing site, base material,<br>
specifications required by the part drawing, process parameters, quality information<br>
and equipment to be used in the proposed process. The user may obtain this<br>
information by referring to the documentation obtained prior to accessing the system.<br>
The user directly inputs the required information into fields or selects the appropriate<br>
choices from pull-down menus. Illustrations may be provided to assist the user in<br>
understanding what information is being requested.<br>
As the information is inputted, the logic processing software compares the <br>
information against a rule-based logic model for the applicable process. The logic <br>
model, which may be in the form of a decision tree or spreadsheet or a combination of<br>
both, is an interpretation of the engineering specification of the process for which the<br>
technical plan is being constructed. For example, the logic model can include<br>
predetermined acceptable ranges and values for processing a part to be manufactured<br>
given the specific inputted information. The logic processing software formats the <br>
inputted data into a technical plan and outputs a preliminary technical plan document <br>
where exceptions to the rules contained in the logic model are identified. Once the<br>
user has considered the exceptions and modified the inputs as appropriate to address<br>
the exceptions, the system is directed to output a completed technical plan that is<br>
submitted for review. The system will produce technical plans in a standardized<br>
format regardless of the individual user. Thus, the system is able to construct<br>
technical plans with a minimal number of reviews and revisions as compared to<br>
conventional approaches.<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein identical reference numerals denote the same<br>
elements throughout the various views, Figure 1 shows one embodiment of a<br>
computer-based system 10 that uses the above-mentioned logic processing software<br>
for constructing technical plans, the system 10 includes a central host or server<br>
computer 12 and one or more user computers 14 connected by a computer network 16.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the network 16 is the World Wide Web, although it<br>
possible to employ other types of computer networks such as a local area network or a<br>
wide area network.<br>
As used herein, the "World Wide Web" (or simply the "Web") refers to the distributed<br>
collection of interlinked, computer viewable hypertext documents (commonly referred<br>
to as web pages) that are accessible via the Internet. As is known in the art, such<br>
hypertext documents are accessed with client and server software using standard<br>
Internet protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)<br>
and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). Currently, HTTP is the primary protocol<br>
for allowing applications to locate and acquire web pages, and web pages are notated<br>
with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). However, as used herein, the terms<br>
"World Wide Web" and "Web" are intended to encompass not only HTTP and<br>
HTML, but also any current or future transport protocols or markup languages that<br>
may be used in place of, or in addition to, HTTP and HTML.<br>
The user computers 14 may be any type of computing devices that are capable of<br>
transmitting requests and receiving web pages over the network 16. For example, the<br>
user computers 12 can be personal or work station computers having a central [<br>
processing unit (CPU), a hard disk and one or more auxiliary disk drives for j<br>
computer-readable storage media such as floppy disks, CD-ROMs or other optical<br>
media, magnetic tapes and the like. As is known in the art, the user computers 12 will<br>
typically include known input/output devices such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a<br>
monitor and a printer. A communication device, such as a modem, is included for I<br>
providing the computers 12 with a connection to the computer network 16. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to personal or<br>
work station computers and can be implemented on other types of computer systems<br>
such as main frame computers, laptop computers and personal digital assistants<br>
including wireless handheld computers.<br>
The server computer 12 includes a web server (i.e., logic processing software that<br>
serves requested HTML pages or files), and each user computer 14 includes<br>
conventional web browser software that allows the user computers 14 to access the<br>
web pageTstored on the server computer 12, as well as other data stored on any other<br>
server systems connected to the network 16. Generally, the web server receives<br>
requests to access web pages from one or more of the user computers 14 and provides<br>
the web pages to the requesting user computers 14. The server computer 12 also has<br>
the above-mentioned logic processing software for constructing technical plans.<br>
 To utilize the system 10, a user accesses the logic processing software on the server<br>
computer 12 with one of the user computers 14. Specifically, the user is able to<br>
access and launch the logic processing software by sending a request to the server<br>
computer 12 by inputting the appropriate Internet address or selecting the appropriate<br>
link on a web page. The server computer 12 responds by downloading a user interface<br>
screen that is displayed on the requesting user computer 14. The user enters the<br>
required data and submits it back to the server computer 12. The server computer 12<br>
processes the inputs provided by the user, compares the inputs against the logic model<br>
resident on the server computer 12, and outputs to the user computer 14 the<br>
preliminary technical plan. The user considers any exceptions identified in the<br>
preliminary technical plan and submits any desired changes to the input data to the<br>
server computer 12. The server computer 12 re-processes the inputs provided by the<br>
user and outputs to the user computer 14 the completed technical plan.<br>
With this arrangement, the logic processing software can also be accessed by other<br>
users at other locations using one of the other user computers 14. This provides a<br>
distributed system that is capable of uniform distribution of the logic processing<br>
software to a number of sites. This embodiment is configured so that the logic<br>
processing is done on the server computer 12. In this configuration, the system 10 is<br>
able to provide security for the logic models and minimizes the amount of data that is<br>
transferred over the network 16. The central control of the logic processing software<br>
also ensures that all users are utilizing the latest revision.<br>
In one alternative, the logic processing software can be downloaded to the user<br>
computer 14 via the network 16 each time the user uses the system 10. In this case,<br>
the user submits a request to use the system 10 to the server computer 12 and the<br>
server computer 12 responds by downloading the logic processing software to the user<br>
computer \2. The logic processing software is not copied to the hard disk but rather is <br>
retained with the user computer's RAM for use during that session. Thus, the logic<br>
processing is done on the user computer 14 rather than the server computer 12. When<br>
the user is finished and exits the software, it must be downloaded once again from the<br>
server computer 12 to establish another session. While this approach does not provide<br>
the same security for the logic model's as the previously described configuration, it<br>
does ensure that the latest revision of the logic processing software is used. Another<br>
alternative would be to download the logic processing software from the server <br>
computer 12 to the user computer local disk drive memory via the network 16. From <br>
that point on, the user can repeatedly run the logic processing software on the user<br>
computer 14 without further download, except as needed for updates.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the system 10 can be implemented as a standalone<br>
computer system rather than a web-based system. In this case, the system 10 would<br>
essentially comprise a single computer, such as one of the user computers 14<br>
described above. As previously discussed, this could include persona] or work station<br>
computers having a CPU, a hard disk, one or more auxiliary disk drives for computer-<br>
readable media such as floppy disks, CD-ROMs or other optical media, magnetic<br>
tapes and the like, and known input/output devices. Other types of computer systems<br>
such as mainframe computers, laptop, computers and personal digital assistants<br>
including wireless handheld computers could also be used. The logic processing<br>
software could be accessed from a removable computer-readable medium, such as a<br>
floppy disk, CD-ROM or other optical medium, magnetic tape or the like, inserted<br>
into the appropriate drive. With this approach, the logic processing software could be<br>
accessed directly from the removable computer-readable medium, or it could be<br>
transferred to the computer's hard disk and accessed from there. As used herein, the<br>
term "computer-readable medium" refers generally to any medium from which stored<br>
data can be read by a computer. This includes not only removable media such as the<br>
aforementioned floppy disk or CD-ROM, but also non-removable media such as the<br>
hard disk.<br>
As mentioned above, a user utilizes the system 10 by accessing and launching the<br>
logic processing software with one of the user computers 14 (as either a networked or<br>
standalone computer). Once launched, the logic processing software generates a user<br>
interface screen 18, shown in Figures 2 and 3, that is displayed on the monitor of the<br>
user computer 14. The user interface screen 18 is a graphical user interface that<br>
guides the user through the steps of the technical plan construction process. By way<br>
of example, a user interface screen used in connection with a holemaking process will<br>
be described herein. This is applicable to situations such as where, in the manufacture<br>
of a part, the engineering drawing for the part sets forth that one or more holes are to<br>
be made in accordance with a specific holemaking specification. In which case, the<br>
system 10 can used to construct a technical plan for performing the holemaking<br>
process. While the illustrated example pertains to a holemaking process, it should be<br>
noted that the present invention is not so limited and can be used with a wide variety<br>
of specifications and processes.<br>
The interface screen 18 includes a series of tabs 20-24 along the bottom thereof. The<br>
user can selectively choose among the tabs to display a variety of specific screens in<br>
the user interface screen 18. Selecting the "Instructions" tab 20 will cause an<br>
instruction screen to be displayed. This screen provides general instructions that assist<br>
the user in using the system 10 to construct a technical plan.<br>
Selecting the "Source" tab 21 will cause a first input screen to be displayed. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, the first input screen includes a number of input windows that<br>
allow the user to enter information relating to the part being manufactured and the<br>
manufacturing source or supplier. Each of the input windows is labeled with a<br>
description of the type of data to be entered to guide the user in entering the proper<br>
data therein. The data are entered (with input peripherals such as a pointing device<br>
and/or keyboard) by selecting inputs from a pull-down menu of items or by directly<br>
entering information into the input window. The input windows are designed to elicit<br>
from the user all the information that is needed to construct the technical plan.<br>
For convenience, the input windows are arranged into first and second primary groups<br>
26 and 28. The first group 26 contains a first subset of input windows in which<br>
information relating to the primary and subtler sources of the part and whether each<br>
source is qualified for the relevant holemaking specification (which is identified as<br>
specification number 10201 in the Figures). A second subset of input windows is<br>
provided for obtaining information about the part in which the holes are formed, such<br>
as part number, name, material, etc. A third subset of input windows is provided for<br>
obtaining information specific to the holes, such as diameter, tolerances, hole length,<br>
number of holes and specification class.<br>
The second group 28 of input windows collects information about the equipment to be<br>
used in the holemaking process. For each piece of equipment identified in the second<br>
group 28, the user also indicates whether the equipment has been qualified for the<br>
relevant specification and which source will be using the equipment.<br>
Selecting the "Process" tab 22 will cause a second input screen, which is shown in<br>
Figure 3, to be displayed in the user interface screen 18. The second input screen<br>
contains a plurality of input windows used to obtain information describing the<br>
proposed procedure for performing the holemaking process. The input windows are<br>
i arranged in a number of rows and columns where each row is labeled with a<br>
description of a process parameter to be entered into the input windows of that row.<br>
Each column corresponds to a particular step in the overall process. Thus, the user<br>
would enter the appropriate process parameters in the first column for the first process<br>
step, in the second column for the second process step, and so on. While only four<br>
columns are shown in Figure 3. it should be noted that any number of columns could<br>
be provided.<br>
Only the pertinent input windows for each step need to have data entered. For<br>
example, if a step involved an abrading operation, then process parameters such as grit<br>
size, abrasive concentration, bond or abrasive carrier and stroke rate, in addition to<br>
general parameters such as process step number, process, source, etc., would be<br>
entered in the corresponding column. If a step involved drilling, then specific process<br>
parameters such as tool speed and tool feed rate would be entered in that column. As<br>
with the first input screen, the data are entered (with input peripherals such as a<br>
pointing device and/or keyboard) by selecting inputs from a pull-down menu of items<br>
or by directly entering information into the input window.<br>
It is emphasized that the present invention is not limited to the particular input screens<br>
shown in Figures 2 and 3, which are merely presented as one example to facilitate<br>
description of the present invention. It should be understood that the configuration of<br>
the input screens, and the data received therein, will vary depending on the process or<br>
specification for which the technical plan is being constructed.<br>
In operation, the user accesses the system 10 in the manner described above and then<br>
enters all pertinent data via the first and second input screens. As the input data is<br>
being entered, the logic processing software compares the data against the appropriate<br>
logic model and formats the information into a technical plan. The technical plan is<br>
continually updated as data is entered.<br>
After the information has been entered, the user can cause the preliminary technical<br>
plan to be output. There are two options for achieving this: selecting the "Summary"<br>
tab 23 or selecting an "Output" button 30 near the bottom of the second input screen.<br>
Selecting the "Summary" tab 23 causes an output screen showing the preliminary<br>
technical plan to be displayed. Selecting the "Output" button 30 also causes an output 
screen showing the preliminary technical plan to be displayed and reformats the<br>
technical plan into a formatted file appropriate for use with standard word processing<br>
software. While both the "Summary" tab 23 and the "Output" button 30 are shown in<br>
the Figures, it should be noted that the present invention could be configured to<br>
contain only one or the other of these two output options.<br>
The preliminary technical plan identifies any exceptions to the logic model rules that<br>
are detected by the logic processing software. As used herein, "exceptions" refer to a<br>
required data field for which no data was entered or to entered data that falls outside<br>
of an acceptable range or value defined by the logic model. For example, if the user<br>
choose a particular piece of equipment that had an acceptable tool speed in the range<br>
of 10,000-40,000 rpm and also entered a tool speed of 60,000 rpm, then an exception<br>
would be noted on the preliminary technical plan. Exceptions can be noted in any<br>
suitable manner, such as highlighting the excepted data on the output screen.<br>
The user considers the exceptions and makes any appropriate corrections. Continuing<br>
the above example, the user would change the 60,000 rpm tool speed to a speed<br>
within the acceptable range or choose a different piece of equipment. In some<br>
circumstances the user can override exceptions. Once all of the exceptions have been<br>
addressed, the user causes the system 10 to output a completed technical plan by again<br>
selecting either the "Summary" tab 23 or the "Output" button 30. The completed<br>
technical plan provides an overview of the process that the user is proposing be used<br>
to meet the specification. The technical plan, which includes all information needed<br>
for review, can incorporate drawings, pictures and links to accessible computer files.<br>
The user interface screen 18 further includes the "Revision History" tab 24. Selecting<br>
the "Revision History" tab 24 will display a screen showing the history of changes and<br>
revisions made to the technical plan since the original issue.<br>
As mentioned above, the logic processing software uses a logic model of rules in<br>
constructing a technical plan for a particular specification. Thus, logic models are<br>
provided for a number of specifications. Each logic model sets forth the acceptable<br>
ranges and values applicable to performing the process of the corresponding<br>
specification. The logic models are created by one or more experts that determine the<br>
acceptable process parameter ranges. The logic models thus provide consistent and<br>
accurate interpretations of the specifications.<br>
The foregoing has described a system and method for automatically constructing<br>
technical plans. While specific embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
thereto can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br>
