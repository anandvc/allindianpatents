				<td>DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT TUMOURS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of quinoline derivatives for the manufacturing of a<br>
medicament for the clinical treatment of a plurality of malignant tumours, especially in solid<br>
form. Furthermore, the present invention relates to structurally novel quinoline derivatives, to<br>
methods for their preparation and to compositions containing them. The types of cancer that<br>
are especially inhibited by the quinoline derivatives of the present invention include, for<br>
example, breast cancers, colon cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma, lung cancers, ovarian cancers,<br>
prostatic cancers, and skin cancers. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
quinoline derivatives suitable for treatment of and preventing the development of prostatic<br>
cancer, and for preventing and treatment of the metastases of prostatic cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solid tumours, primary or metastases consist of several types of cells where the tumour cells<br>
are the pivotal cell type and the driving force. When microtumours reach a certain size, the<br>
requirement of nutrition cannot be satisfied by plain diffusion. New vessels penetrate the<br>
tumour establishing a microenvironment providing the tumour with optimal nutrition for<br>
further proliferation and growth. This tumour induced angiogenesis, inducing proliferation,<br>
migration and differentiation of normal endothelial cells from nearby small blood vessels, is a<br>
prerequisite for the growth of solid tumours. In concordance the inhibition of angiogenesis<br>
results in an effective inhibition of growth of solid tumours.<br>
Solid tumours spread by penetrating tissue borders and give rise to daughter cell colonies or<br>
metastases. Single tumour cells or small cell aggregates spread by the blood or the lymph<br>
system to distant sites. In this process the tumour cells are vulnerable and can be extinguished<br>
by natural killer (NK) cells, a distinct type of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Enhanced activity or an<br>
increased number of NK cells reduce or inhibit the metastasising process in solid tumour<br>
disease.<br>
Prostatic cancer is a malignant tumour disease that spreads to distant sites as tumour<br>
metastases and comprises tumours with great dependence of neovascularisation.<br>
Prostatic cancer has long been a major affliction of men, and it is becoming more common<br>
and dangerous as the population ages. It isan adenocarcinoma that is second only to lung<br>
cancer in mortality. Prostate cancer currently accounts for about 35.000 deaths each year in<br>
the United States alone. To the present time, there are no effective preventive or treatment<br>
methods for prostatic cancer. When the cancer is in its early, hormone-dependent stage, it is<br>
commonly treated by orchiectomy or chemical castration. In the later stages of prostatic<br>
cancer, the disease becomes hormone-independent and metastasises widely, usually first into<br>
the skeleton. Treatment for advanced disease initially involves hormonal manipulations and<br>
palliative radiotherapy or treatment with cytostatic agents. These strategies have proven to be<br>
of marked clinical benefit in terms of symptomatic relief but there are no effective methods,<br>
which can put prostatic cancer into remission in mat stage. The use of cytotoxic agents in the<br>
management of hormone-resistant advanced prostate cancer remains poorly defined. A few<br>
single agents have become "standard therapy", although demonstration of their efficacy, by<br>
contemporary standards, is lacking. Thus, prostatic cancer is not only relatively common, but<br>
is refractory to treatment once the disease crosses into the hormone-independent stage.<br>
In US Patent No. 4,547,511 and in EP 59,698 some derivatives of N-aryl-1,2-dihydro-4-<br>
ammo-1-alkyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamide and N-aryl-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-alky 1-2-<br>
oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamide are claimed as enhancers of cell-mediated immunity.<br>
Roquinimex (Merck Index 12th Ed., No. 8418; Linomide® N-methyl-N-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-4-<br>
hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamide) has been reported to have antitumour<br>
effects on Dunning R-3327 rat prostatic cancers (1).<br>
Some 5-substituted N-aryl-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-alkyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamides<br>
effective in the treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity and pathologic<br>
inflammation are known from WO 99/55678, PCT/SE99/01270 and PCT/SE99/01271.<br>
Roquinimex, a compound with shown anti-angiogenic and pro NK lymphocyte activities also<br>
induce pro-inflammatory side effects in humans that was emphasised when treating patients<br>
with renal cell carcinoma (2). Roquinimex in this study was poorly tolerated, with 40 % of the<br>
patients being withdrawn or having dose reductions due to adverse events, mostly influenza-<br>
like symptoms of myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue. Several cases of pericarditis and neuropathy<br>
were also observed.<br>
Pro-inflammatory effects induced by roquinimex are efficiently monitored in the beagle dog.<br>
Roquinimex induces the beagle pain syndrome characterised by fever, myalgia, arthralgia as<br>
well as arteritis (3,4).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary objective of the present invention is the use of quinoline derivatives for the<br>
manufacturing of a medicament for the treatment of a plurality of malignant tumours,<br>
especially in solid form. Another objective is to provide structurally novel quinoiine<br>
derivatives, having a pharmacological profile that is distinguished by high potency in<br>
experimental models and low level of side effects. The types of cancer that are especially<br>
inhibited by these quinoiine derivatives include, for example, breast cancers, colon cancers,<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, lung cancers, ovarian cancers, prostatic cancers, and skin cancers. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to quinoiine derivatives suitable for the prevention<br>
of the development of malignant tumours, in particular prostatic cancers, and prevention and<br>
treatment of the metastases of malignant tumours, particularly of prostatic cancers. To<br>
increase the cure rate of metastatic malignant tumours, in particular of prostatic cancers, an<br>
effective therapy for malignant tumour cells, particularly androgen-independent prostatic<br>
cancer cells, is needed. The approach we have chosen is to inhibit the tumour-induced<br>
angiogenesis and to stimulate the frost immune system to evoke/enhance an antitumour<br>
response. In the present invention, the ability of quinoiine compounds to elicit an antitumour<br>
effect against an androgen-independent Dunning R-3327 AT-1 rat prostatic cancer was tested.<br>

High crystal lattice energy of solid compounds results in poor solubility, e.g., in water. Hence,<br>
an approach to reduce this energy will result in improved aqueous solubility. The prodrug per<br>
se is an inactive species. A basal requisite for a prodrug approach is the reconversion ot the<br>
prodrug to the parent drug in vivo. The prodrug - drug conversion may take place before,<br>
during or after absorption. The necessary conversion of prodrugs to the parent drug molecules<br>
in the body can take place by a variety of reactions. The most common prodrugs are those<br>
requiring a hydrolytic cleavage mediated by enzymatic hydrolysis. In other cases, drug<br>
molecules are regenerated from their prodrugs by biochemical reductive or oxidative<br>
processes.<br>
Esters of drugs containing a hydroxyl function have been considered as prodrug types<br>
primarily from the fact that the organism is rich in enzymes capable of hydrolysing esters.<br>
Compounds of the present invention contain an enolised carbonyl group as a prominent<br>
functional group. Under proper conditions, the enol form can be trapped by acylation of the<br>
enol group. Steric and electronic effects within the acyl group have a substantial influence<br>
upon both die aqueous and enzymatic rates of hydrolysis. Besides, physicochemical properties<br>
such as water-solubility, lipopbilicity and dissolution rate can be modified for the parent<br>
compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention contain a 4-amino function. N-Acylation of amines to<br>
give activated amides may be a promising means of obtaining prodrug forms. 2-Hydroxy-<br>
methylbenzamides undergo a cyclisation (lactonisation) in aqueous solution to give phtalide<br>
and free amine. Substitution of the two methylene hydrogen atoms of 2-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzamide with, for example, methyl and phenyl groups greatly affects the<br>
lactonisation rates. Also blocking the lactonisation by acylation of the 2-hydroxymethyl-<br>
benzamides to give 2-acyloxymethylbenzamides affects the lactonization that must be<br>
preceded by hydrolysis of the ester grouping. Furthermore, the acylation allows control of the<br>
lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the prodrug by the appropriate selection of the acyl group. The<br>
use of various carbamate derivatives as well as N-Mannich bases can also be considered as<br>
means to forming prodrugs.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) were assayed for their capacity to inhibit of growth of<br>
the Dunning R-3327 AT-1 tumour, a prostatic rat cancer. Roquinimex was used as positive<br>
treatment control and showed a 30 % inhibition at 4 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) wherein A is NR42 R43 are prepared by the following<br>
method:<br>
Method A.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I') may be prepared by known methods, for example, by reaction<br>
of 4-chloro-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamide derivative (X = Cl; II) known from<br>
US patent No. 4,547,511 with an amino compound in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol,<br>
e.g., ethanol. All compounds had satisfactory 1H-NMR and mass spectra, although the NMR<br>
spectra were complicated due to presence of E and Z amide isomers. Only the major isomer is<br>
described by NMR-shifts below.<br><br>
The compounds of general formula (I") may be prepared by methods known from US patent<br>
No. 6,077, 851 and, for example, as shown above, by reaction of an ester derivative of the<br>
quinoline carboxylic acid with an aniline in a suitable solvent such as toluene, xylene and the<br>
like. General methods for preparation of the quinoline carboxylic acid ester derivatives of<br>
formula (III) are known from US patent No. 4,547,511. N-alkylated anilines of formula (IV)<br>
are commercially available or known from literature, e.g., in Johnstone et al, J. Chem. Soc.<br>
1969, 2223-2224. Compounds falling within the scope of formula (TV) may be prepared by<br>
methods, which are generally analogous to those of said literature.<br>

1.2-Dihydro-4-hydroxy-5-dimethylamino-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl<br>
ester.<br>
A solution of 2,6-difluorobensonitrile (35.7 g, 0.26 mol) and dimethylamine (17.5 g, 0.39<br>
mol) in 100 ml of anhydrous isopropanol was heated at 110°C for 18 hours in an autoclave.<br>
After cooling, the solvent was evaporated and the residue worked up with water and diethyl<br>
edier to give a yellowish oil of 2-dimethylamino-6-fluorobensonitrile (41 g) contaminated<br>
with 2-4 % of 2,6-di(dimethylamino)bensonitrile. This crude mixture was solved in 40 %<br>
aqueous methylamine (130 ml, 1.5 mol) and ethanol (100 ml) and heated at 110°C for 18<br>
hours in an autoclave. The product was worked up as above to give 44 g of 2-dimethylamino-<br>
6-methylaminobensonitrile (&gt;95 % pure). This was hydrolysed in cone, sulphuric acid (170<br>
ml) and water (34 ml) at 120°C for 3 hours. The brown solution was cooled and neutralised<br>
with 5 M NaOH. The resulting cloudy mixture was filtered through celite and washed with 30<br>
ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane (3x50 ml), the<br>
extracts were washed with water and evaporated to give 6-dimethylamino-N-methyl-<br>
anthranilic acid. The anthranilic acid (21.5 g, 0.11 mol) was dissolved in 250 ml of 1,4-<br>
dioxane. Phosgene (25 ml, 0.45 mol) was slowly added under cooling in an ice bath. The<br>
mixture was warmed at 40°C for 1 hour, cooled to 15°C, and the product was collected by<br>
filtration. This was worked up with aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dichloromethane, the<br>
organ phase carefully dried and evaporated to give pure 5-dimethylamino-N-methyl-isatoic<br>
anhydride. The anhydride (22 g, 0.10 mol) was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (150 ml) and<br>
sodium methoxide (5.4 g, 0.10 mol) was added. After stirring at 50°C for 3 hours, the solvent<br>
was removed and the residue worked up with water and ether to give a yellow oil (15 g). The<br>
oil, 6-dimethylamino-N-methyl-anthranilic acid methyl ester (10.4 g, 0.05 mol), was dissolved<br>
in dichloromethane (100 ml) and cooled on an ice-bath. Ethyl malonyl chloride (10 g, 0.07<br>
mol) was added. After being stirred for 1 hour at room temperature the cloudy mixture was<br>
washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was carefully dried and<br>
concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in dry ethanol (100 ml) and sodium<br>
methoxide (9 g. 0.16 mol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour and neutralised with<br>
hydrochloric acid. The solvent was removed and the residue worked up with water and<br>
dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried and the solvent removed to give the title<br>
compound as pure, greyish crystals (11 g).<br>

To a cooled solution of 4-bromoaniline (3.4 g, 0.02 mol) and triethylamine (5.5 ml, 0.04 mol)<br>
in dichloromethane (50 ml) was slowly added trifluoracetic anhydride (3.4 ml, 0.024 mol).<br>
After 1 hour stirring, the mixture was worked up with aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.5 M) and<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was dried and evaporated to dryness. The<br>
crystals (5.2 g) formed was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (40 ml), cooled and treated with<br>
potassium tert-butoxide (3.4 g, 0.03 mol). After 1 hour stirring, methyl iodide (3.8 ml, 0.06<br>

manner with aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.5 M), aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried and<br>
evaporated to dryness to give 4.6 g of the intermediate N-(4-bromophenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-N-<br>
methylacetamide. In a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, this material (4.6 g, 0.016 mol) was<br>
charged in a carefully nitrogen purged reaction-vessel along with toluene (40 ml), sodium<br>
bicarbonate (5.4 g, 0.064 mol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.6 g, 0.048 mol)<br>
and water (15 ml). Benseneboronic acid (2.2 g, 0.017 mol) dissolved in ethanol (8 ml) was<br>
added into the vessel and the black mixture was heated to reflux under strong stirring during<br>
10 hours. The mixture was cooled, filtered through celite and the organic phase evaporated to<br>
dryness. The residue was recrystallised from ethanol to give beige crystals ( 2.4 g, 54 %<br>
yield). The crystals were hydrolysed in a methanol/ammonia 1:1 mixture (50 ml) under short<br>
heating, (1 hour). The solvents were evaporated and the residue dissolved in dichloromethane<br>
(25 ml), dried and evaporated to dryness to give the title compound as 1.3 g syrup.<br>

Pharmacological methods<br>
Primary screen<br>
R-3327 AT-1 Prostatic cancer in man is an angiogenic type of solid tumour. The Dunning R-<br>
3327 AT-1 is a prostatic cancer of the rat and suits as an experimental animal model for this<br>
disease. The AT-1 tumour is serially transplanted subcutaneously (sc) on syngeneic rats of the<br>
Copenhagen strain. Small pieces of the tumour are transplanted sc to recipient rats and<br>
treatment of the tumour bearing rats start when the tumours are easily measurable<br>
approximately on day 10 after transplantation. Doses of the compounds are given either orally<br>
or parentally 5 days a week for four weeks. The tumour growth and body weight gain are<br>
monitored during the experimental time.<br>
Assays for evaluation of pro-inflammatory activity<br>
Beagle Pain Syndrome<br>
The Beagle Pain Syndrome (BPS) is reflected by clinical and laboratory manifestations, e.g.,<br>
fever, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alkaline phosphate (AP), induction of<br>
acute phase proteins and vasculitis, justifying BPS as a model for the flu-like syndrome<br>
induced by roquinimex in man. BPS is a disease of acute inflammatory nature. Several<br>
alterations in hematology and clinical chemistry are occurring. The compounds were<br>
administrated intravenously to beagle dogs. The dosage was given for five consecutive days.<br>
The dogs were evaluated for a pro-inflammatory reaction, i.e., increased ESR and AP. The<br>
percentage change of the laboratory values between Day 8 and baseline was determined.<br>
Neutrophil inflammation<br>
Neutrophil inflammation (NI) is induced by intradermal injection of carrageenin or zymosan.<br>
Accumulation of neutrophils is evaluated by measuring the neutrophil enzyme<br>
myeloperoxidase activity from challenged skin.<br>
Oedema formation<br>
Oedema formation is induced by intradermal injection of carrageenin. The extent of oedema is<br>
evaluated by measuring the plasma extravasation of intravenously injected Evans blue in<br>
challenged skin.<br>
Delayed Type Hypersensitivity<br>
Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions are T-cell mediated and antigen-specific<br>
inflammatory reactions useful for studies on modulation of immunological and inflammatory<br>
events. Mice are sensitised to oxazolone by cutaneous administration. Challenge is performed<br>
topically on the ears and the inflammatory reaction is quantified by measuring change in ear<br>
thickness.<br>

The administration of compounds of formula I in order to practice the present methods of<br>
therapy is carried out by administering an effective amount of the chosen compound to the<br>
patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis. The effective amount of an individual<br>
compound is determined by a physician and depends on factors such as the exact disease to be<br>
treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient<br>
suffers, and other factors in tile physician's judgement It will be observed that the compounds<br>
are active at low dosage levels, thereby allowing effective treatment or prophylaxes with<br>
slight probability of side effects or cross-reactions with other treatments or drugs. A suitable<br>
daily dose for use in the treatment of the disease is contemplated to vary between 0.002 mg/kg<br>
to about 100 mg/kg body weight, in particular between 0.02 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight,<br>
depending upon the specific condition, e.g., prostatic cancer, to be treated, the age and weight<br>
of the specific patient, and the specific patient's response to the medication. The exact<br>
individual dosage, as well as the daily dosage, will be determined according to standard<br>
medical principles under the direction of a physician.<br>
Effective quantities of the compounds of formula (I) are preferably administered to a patient<br>
in need of such treatment according to usual routes of administration and formulated in usual<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of the active ingredient and a<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By "pharmaceutically acceptable it is meant the<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation<br>
and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Such compositions may take a variety of forms,<br>
e.g. solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, capsules, and powders prepared for oral<br>
administration, sterile solutions for parental administration, suppositories for rectal<br>
administration or suitable topical formulations. In making the composition of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be admixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier.<br>
or enclosed within a carrier that may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other<br>
container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid material<br>
that acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Various additives to<br>
enhance the stability or ease of administration of the drug are contemplated. Thus, the<br>
compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs,<br>
suspensions, emulsions solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and<br>
hard gelatine capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, sterile packaged powders,<br>
and the like. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable<br>
pharmaceutical formulations are described, for example, in "Pharmaceuticals - The Science of<br>
Dosage Form Design", M.B. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition may also contain additional therapeutically useful substances other than a<br>
compound of formula (I).<br>
