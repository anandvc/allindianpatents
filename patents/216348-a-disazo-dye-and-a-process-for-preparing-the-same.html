The dye mixtures of the invention can be obtained in a conventional manner, for<br>
instance by mechanically mixing the individual dyes in the required proportions or by<br>
synthesis by means of the customary diazotization and coupling reactions using<br>
appropriate mixtures of the diazo and coupling components in a manner familiar to<br>
those skilled in the art and the necessary proportions. One option is for example to<br>
prepare aqueous suspensions of the coupling components 1-amino-8-naphthol-3,6-<br>
disulfonic acid and for example 1-hydroxy-3,5-disulfo-6-N-(1 ",3"-dfketobutyl)-<br>
naphtylamine, and as diazo components, aniline compounds of the formula (9).<br>
Thus the dye mixture can be produced by diazotizing 4-((b-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)-<br>
aniline (9) in a conventional manner in a strongly acid medium and then carrying out<br>
the coupling reaction of the 1-amino-8-napthol-3,6-disulfonic acid with the diazo<br>
component at a pH below 1.5 to form the compound (7). The second coupling<br>
reaction with the monoazo dye (7) giving the disazo dyes conforming to the formula<br>
(1) is carried out at a pH between 3 and 6.5. Then, by addition of the aqueous<br>
solution of the acetoacetylated napthylamine the coupling reaction to form the dye<br>
conforming to the general formula (2) is carried out at a pH between 1 and 6.5. The<br>
inventive dyestuff mixture can be isolated from the solution in the conventional<br>
manner, for example by salting out with an electrolyte salt, such as sodium chloride<br>
or potassium chloride, or by spray-drying.<br>
The acetoacetylated coupling agents employed are readily obtained by reaction of<br>
the appropiately substituted naphtylamines with an excess of 5-200 % of diketene in<br>
aqueous solution between 0-60 °C, preferably between 30-50 °C and at a pH<br>
between 3 and 11 preferably at pH 4 to 8. The resulting acetoacetylated products<br>
can subsequently be used directly for the diazo coupling reaction or can be isolated<br>
by conventional salting out or spray drying. If the reaction solutions are used directly,<br>
excess acyiating agent can be removed by heating to approximately 80 °C.<br>
Dyes of the general formula (2) wherein the azo moieties are of a different structure<br>
are prepared preferably by diazotizing the aromatic amine having the structure<br>
W-NH2<br>
wherein W is as defined above and coupling the resulting diazo-compound<br>
to the naphtylamine of the formula (10)<br>
wherein M, R11 and n are defined as above and then acetoacetylating the<br>
intermediate as described above with subsequent coupling with a second diazo at<br>
the 1,3-diketo moiety.<br>
Dye mixtures In which the dye chromophores contain for example not only a<br>
b-chloroethylsulfonyl or b-thiosulfatoethylsulfonyl or (b-sulfatoethylsulfonyl group but<br>
also proportions with vinylsulfonyl groups cannot only be prepared by the above<br>
mentioned method using appropriate vinylsulfonyl starting anilines, but also by<br>
reacting the dye mixture in which Y is a b-chloroethyl, b-thiosulfatoethyl, or b-<br>
suifatoethyl radical with an amount of alkali required for only part of these groups and<br>
converting part said (b-substituted ethylsulfonyl groups into vinylsulfonyl groups. This<br>
reaction is carried out by generally known methods of converting b-substituted<br>
ethylsulfonyl groups into the vinylsulfonyl group.<br>
The dye mixtures of the instant invention are well suitable for dyeing (which includes<br>
printing) hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing fiber materials by the application<br>
and fixing methods numerously described in the art for fiber-reactive dyes, in deep<br>
black shades with good color build-up and good wash-off in respect of unfixed dye<br>
portions. Moreover, the dyeings obtained show improved wash-fastness.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides for use of the inventive dye mixtures<br>
for dyeing (including printing) hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing fiber<br>
materials and processes for dyeing such fiber materials and processes for dyeing<br>
such materials using a dye mixture according to the invention by applying the dye<br>
mixture to the substrate in dissolved form and fixing the dyes on the fiber by the<br>
action of an alkali or by heating or both.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are natural or synthetic hydroxyl-containing materials,<br>
for example cellulose fiber materials, including in the form of paper, or their<br>
regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials are preferably<br>
cotton but also other natural vegetable fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie<br>
fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example staple viscose and filament<br>
viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamldes<br>
and polyurethanes, in particular in the form of fibers, for example wool and other<br>
animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11, and nylon-4.<br>
Application of the dye mixtures of the invention is by generally known processes for<br>
dyeing and printing fiber materials by the known application techniques for fiber-<br>
reactive dyes. Since the dyes of the dye mixtures according to the invention are<br>
highly compatible with one another, the dye mixtures of the invention are also<br>
advantageously useful in exhaust dyeing processes. Applied in this way for example<br>
to cellulose fibers from a long liquor ratio at temperatures between 40 and 105°C,<br>
optionally at temperatures up to 130°C, under superatmospheric pressure, and<br>
optionally in the presence of customary dyeing assistants with the use of acid-<br>
binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium<br>
sulfate, they produce dyeings in very good color yields with excellent color build-up<br>
and consistent shade. One possible procedure is to introduce the material into the<br>
warm bath, gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing temperature, and complete<br>
the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral salts which speed up the<br>
exhaustion of the dyes can also if desired not be added to the bath until the actual<br>
dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
Similarly, the conventional printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can either be<br>
carried out in single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste containing<br>
sodium bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and the colorant, and<br>
subsequent steaming at from 100 to 103°C, or in two phases, for example by printing<br>
with a neutral or weakly acid print paste containing the colorant and subsequent<br>
fixation either by passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-containing<br>
alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing padding liquor<br>
and subsequent batching of this treated material or subsequent steaming or<br>
subsequent treatment with dry heat, produce strong prints with well defined contours<br>
and a clear white ground. Changing fixing conditions has only little effect on the<br>
outcome of the prints. Not only in dyeing but also in printing the degrees of fixation<br>
obtained with dye mixtures of the invention are very high. The hot air used in dry<br>
heat fixing by the customary thermofix processes has a temperature of from 120 to<br>
200°C. In addition to the customary steam at from 101 to 103°C, it is also possible to<br>
use superheated steam and high pressure steam at up to 160°C.<br>
Acid-binding agents responsible for fixing the dyes to cellulose fibers are for example<br>
water-soluble basic salts of alkali metals and of alkaline earth metals of inorganic or<br>
organic acids, and compounds which release alkali when hot. Of particular suitability<br>
are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or<br>
organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and potassium<br>
compounds. These acid-binding agents are for example sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate,<br>
sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate and disodium hydrogenphosphate.<br>
Treating the dyes of the dye mixtures according to the invention with the acid-binding<br>
agents with or without heating bonds the dyes chemically to the cellulose fiber;<br>
especially the dyeings on cellulose, after they have been given the usual<br>
aftertreatment of rinsing to remove unfixed dye portions, show excellent wet fastness<br>
properties, in particular since the unfixed dye portions are readily washed off<br>
because of their good cold water solubility.<br>
The dyeings of polyurethane and polyamide fibers are customarily carried out from<br>
an acid medium. The dyebath may contain for example acetic acid and/or<br>
ammonium sulfate and/or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate to<br>
bring it to the desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness it is advisable<br>
to add customary leveling assistants, for example based on a reaction product of<br>
cyanuric chloride with three times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic<br>
acid or aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or based on a reaction product offer example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. In general the material to be dyed is introduced<br>
into the bath at a temperature of about 40°C and agitated therein for some time, the<br>
dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acid, preferably weakly acetic acid,<br>
pH, and the actual dyeing is carried out at temperature between 60 and 98°C.<br>
However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or at temperatures up to<br>
120°C (under superatmospheric pressure).<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the Invention. Parts and percentages are by<br>
weight, unless otherwise stated. The parts by weight bear the same relation to parts<br>
by volume as the kilogram to the liter.<br>
