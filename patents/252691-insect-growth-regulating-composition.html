DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The insect growth regulating composition of the present invention is characterized by a microencapsulated insect growth regulating composition, which comprises an insect growth regulating active ingredient encapsulated in a wall formed of a polyurethane or a polyurea, having an average particle diameter of 1 to 40 |jm, a wall thickness of 0.005 to 0.5 pm, and a ratio of wall thickness/average particle diameter of 0.0003 to 0.003, wherein a volume ratio of microencapsulated particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm is not more than 20% by volume based on a total volume of microcapsule particles.<br>
The insect growth regulating composition of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by the following method.<br>
First, an insect growth regulating ingredient and a polyvalent isocyanate are mixed to obtain an oil phase. At this time, a hydrophobic oil solvent may be added to the organic phase, if necessary. The resulting oil phase is dispersed by mixing with an aqueous phase containing a dispersant (dispersing step), and a polyhydric alcohol or a polyvalent amine is added to the dispersion, to perform a microcapsule forming reaction (microencapsulating reaction step). The reaction temperature of this microencapsulating reaction step is usually in a range of 20 to 85°C, and the reaction time is usually in a range of 1 to 90 hours.<br>
In the aforementioned microencapsulating reaction step, when a polyhydric alcohol is used, a microencapsulated product having a polyurethane wall is obtained and, when a polyvalent amine is used, a microencapsulated product having a polyurea wall is obtained.<br>
When a microencapsulating reaction step is performed using a polyhydric alcohol, an oil phase may be dispersed in an aqueous phase in which the polyhydric alcohol is mixed, in place of dispersing an oil phase into an aqueous phase, and then adding the polyhydric alcohol.<br>
Alternatively, a microencapsulating reaction step may be performed without adding a polyhydric alcohol or a polyvalent amine. In this case, a microencapsulated product having a polyurea wall is obtained.<br>
Examples of the dispersant used in the aforementioned process include water-soluble polymers, and specific examples thereof include natural polysaccharides such as gum arabic, natural water-soluble polymers such as gelatin and collagen, water-soluble semi-synthetic polysaccharides such as carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose, and water-soluble synthetic<br>
polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent isocyanate used in the aforementioned process include an adduct of trimethylolpropane and toluenediisocyanate, an adduct of trimethylolpropane and hexamethylenediisocyanate, hexamethylenediisocyanate trimer having a biuret bond, and polyvalent isocyanate having an isocyanurate structure.<br>

As the aromatic hydrocarbon, commercially available solvents may be used as they are, and examples of such the commercially available solvents include Hisol SAS-296 (mixture of l-phenyl-l-xylylethane and 1-phenyl-l- ethylphenylethane; trade name of NIPPON OIL CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent HP-MN (methylnaphthalene 80%; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent HP-DMN (dimethylnaphthalene 80%; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent P-100 (alkylbenzene having 9 to 10 carbon atoms; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent P-150 (alkylbenzene; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent P-180 (mixture of methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent P-200(mixture of methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent P-220 (mixture of methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Cactus Solvent PAD-1 (dimethylmonoisopropylnaphthalene; trade name of JAPAN ENERGY CORPORATION), Solvesso 100 (aromatic hydrocarbon; trade name of EXXONMOBIL CORPORATION), Solvesso 150 (aromatic hydrocarbon; trade name of EXXONMOBIL CORPORATION), Solvesso 200 (aromatic hydrocarbon; trade name of EXXONMOBIL CORPORATION), Swasol 100 (toluene; trade name of MARUZEN PETEROCHEMICAL CO., LTD.), and Swasol 200 (xylene; trade name of MARUZEN PETEROCHEMICAL CO., LTD.).<br>
Examples of the dialkyl ester of aliphatic dicarboxylic acid include dialkyl adipates such as dibutyl adipate, and dioctyl adipate. As the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid diester, commercially available solvents may be used as they are, and examples of such the commercially solvents include Vinycizer 40 (diisobutyl adipate; trade name of KAO CORPORATION) and Vinycizer 50 (diisodecyl adipate; trade name of KAO CORPORATION).<br>
Thus, the microcapsules can be obtained as slurry containing them.<br>
The microcapsules are used by formulating into various forms such as slurry, powder and granules. Usually, the microcapsules are used as a slurry composition in which the microcapsules are suspended in water, i.e., an aqueous suspension concentrate.<br>
The aqueous suspension concentrate may further contain a preservative and; various stabilizers, for example, a thickener, an antifreezing agent, and a specific gravity regulating agent.<br>

Usually, 0.5 to 50% by weight of the insect growth regulating active ingredient is contained in the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention.<br>
Then, an average particle diameter, a wall thickness, and a volume ratio of microencapsulated particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm based on a total volume of microcapsules in the present invention will be explained. The average particle diameter in the present invention means a volume median diameter and, for example, a value measured using a laser diffraction type particle size analyzer (specifically, for example, Mastersizer 2000 (product of MALVERN Instruments Ltd.)) can be adopted.<br>
The wall thickness of microcapsules varies depending on a ratio of volumes of a core substance and a wall substance, and can be calculated by the following approximate equation. That is, when Wc represents a weight of a core substance of the microcapsules, Ww represents a weight of a wall substance, pw represents a density of a wall substance, pc represents a density of a core substance, and d represents an average particle diameter of a core substance, the wall thickness is:<br>
Wall thickness = (Ww/Wc)x(pc/pw)x(d/6) The wall thickness referred in the present invention is calculated using this equation.<br>
The volume ratio of microencapsulated particles having<br>
a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm based on a total volume of microcapsules can be calculated from a volume distribution measured using, for example, a laser diffraction type particle size analyzer (specifically, for example, Mastersizer 2000 (product of MALVERN Instruments Ltd.)).<br>
In the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention, the average particle diameter is 1 to 40 jam, the wall thickness is 0.005 to 0.5 pm, the ratio of wall thickness/average particle diameter is 0.0003 to 0.003, and the volume ratio of microcapsule particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm is not more than 20% by volume based on a total volume of microencapsulated particles.<br>
In the present invention, microcapsules having an average particle diameter of 1 to 40 |4m, a wall thickness of 0.005 to 0.5 pm, a ratio of wall thickness/average particle diameter of 0.0003 to 0.003, and a volume ratio of microencapsulated particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm of not more than 20% by volume based on a total volume of microencapsulated particles can be obtained, for example, by adjusting (1) a kind and a concentration of a dispersant dissolved in an aqueous phase,<br>
(2)	a ratio of an aqueous phase and an oil phase, and/or<br>
(3)	a dispersion manner, and a stirring intense at the time<br>
of dispersing the oil phase in the aqueous phase, in the aforementioned dispersing step of the production process of the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, for example, a kind and a concentration of a dispersant to be dissolved in an aqueous phase are determined, an oil phase is mixed with an aqueous phase at a volume ratio of 0.3 to 2 of the oil phase relative to 1 of the aqueous phase, and the oil phase is dispersed in the aqueous phase under appropriate operation conditions of a dispersing machine. An average particle diameter of oil particles and a volume ratio of oil particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 Jim based on a total volume of oil particles in the resulting dispersion are measured using a laser diffraction type particle size analyzer (specifically, for example, Mastersizer 2000 (product of MALVERN Instruments Ltd.)).<br>
If the average particle diameter of oil particles in the dispersion thus obtained is less than 1 ^tm* a dispersion having a larger average particle diameter of oil particles can be obtained by modifying the dispersing step, such as by reducing the dispersant concentration, reducing the stirring intense at the time of dispersion of the oil phase in the aqueous phase, reducing the volume ratio of the oil phase relative to the aqueous phase, and/or<br>
changing the dispersant. On the other hand, if the average particle diameter of oil particles in the resulting dispersion is larger than 40 pm, a dispersion having a smaller average particle diameter of oil particles can be obtained by modifying the dispersing step, such as by increasing the dispersant concentration, increasing the stirring intense at the time of dispersion of the oil phase in the aqueous phase, increasing the volume ratio of the oil phase relative to the aqueous phase, and/or changing the dispersant.<br>
If the volume ratio of oil particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 fim based on a total volume of oil particles in the dispersion thus obtained is more than 20% by volume, a dispersion having not more than 20% by volume of the volume ratio of oil particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 pm based on a total volume of oil particles can be obtained by modifying the dispersing step, such as by increasing the stirring speed of the dispersing machine, uniformly dispersing the entire dispersion, and/or changing the dispersant.<br>
The properties of a particle diameter of oil particles in a dispersion are reflected in the properties of the microencapsulated particles of the microencapsulated composition obtained by the microencapsulating step.<br>
Further, the wall thickness can be changed by<br>
adjusting amounts of the wall materials of microcapsules used for preparation of the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention, that is, the amounts of a polyvalent isocyanate and a polyhydric alcohol or a polyvalent amine, in particular, an amount of a polyvalent isocyanate according to an average particle diameter of oil particles in a dispersion. Namely, first, the conditions of the dispersing step are determined so that an average particle diameter of oil particles in a dispersion becomes 1 to 40 pm, and a volume ratio of oil particles having a particle diameter of not less than 50 |im based on a total volume of oil particles becomes not more than 20% by volume. After that, the amounts of a polyvalent isocyanate and a polyhydric alcohol or a polyvalent amine suitable for a predetermined wall thickness can be determined so that a ratio of wall thickness/average particle diameter becomes 0.0003 to 0.003.<br>

Then, efficacy of the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention will be shown by Test Examples.<br>
Test Example 1<br>
An insect growth regulating composition to be tested was diluted with water so that a pyriproxyfen concentration became 1 ppm to prepare a test solution. A pumpkin (fruit) was immersed into the test solution for 30 seconds, and air-dried. Egg masses (200 to 300 eggs) of Pseudaulacaspis pentagons were placed on two sites of this pumpkin, and allowed to develop in a room at 25°C for 25 days.<br>
Thereafter, the number of male cocoons (male prepupae) of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona produced on the test pumpkin was counted.<br>
A pumpkin which had not treated with a drug was subjected to the similar test and, by taking the number of male cocoons of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona produced on the non-treated pumpkin as 100, a ratio of the number of male cocoons of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona produced on the treated pumpkin was calculated to obtain insecticidal effect. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
In Table, the insecticidal effect is represented by the following criteria:<br>
A: The number of male cocoons of the treated pumpkin is less than 40% of the number of male cocoons of the non- treated pumpkin.<br>
B: The number of male cocoons of the treated pumpkin is 40 to 50% of the number of male cocoons of the non-treated pumpkin.<br>
C: The number of male cocoons of the treated pumpkin is more than 50% of the number of male cocoons of the non- treated pumpkin.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
A cabbage seedling planted in a plastic cup was placed for 24 hours into a net cage in which a number of Bemisia argentifolii inhabited, and Bemisia argentifolii was allowed to lay eggs on the cabbage seedling. Thereafter, the cabbage seedling was removed from the net cage, and one leaf of cabbage was taken by cutting.<br>
On the other hand, an insect growth regulating composition to be tested was diluted with water so that a pyriproxyfen concentration became 1 ppm to prepare a test solution. The leaf of cabbage was immersed into the test solution for 30 seconds, air-dried, and allowed to develop in a room at 25°C for 8 days. Thereafter, the numbers of hatched eggs and unhatched eggs were investigated, and an ovicidal rate was calculated. Each of the insect growth regulating compositions of the present invention prepared in Preparation Examples 1 to 4 had an ovicidal rate of 90% or higher.<br>
As described hereinabove, the insect growth regulating composition of the present invention is useful for controlling insect pests.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
