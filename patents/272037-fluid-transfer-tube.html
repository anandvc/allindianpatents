				<td>FLUID TRANSFER TUBE<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a device for transferring fluid,<br>
and more particularly to a fluid transfer tube for a component in a transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Automatic transmissions typically include a hydraulic circuit or<br>
system that uses a hydraulic fluid, such as oil, for various purposes throughout<br>
the transmission. For example, the hydraulic system may direct oil to various<br>
transmission components to act as lubrication between moving components, to<br>
act as a cooling system for dissipating waste heat, and to act as a hydraulic<br>
control system for actuating various devices.<br>
[0004] In many applications it may be desirable to transmit fluid along<br>
the length of a shaft, such as a turbine shaft or input/output shaft. However,<br>
these shafts are preferably hollow to reduce weight and cost since most of the<br>
strength of the shaft is provided by the outer diameter of the shaft, thereby<br>
making interior material unnecessary. Various methods have been employed to<br>
transmit fluid along the length of a shaft, such as non-concentric bore holes and<br>
multiple sleeves. While useful for their intended purpose, there is a need for a<br><br>
device to transmit hydraulic fluid through a shaft that reduces weight, cost, and<br>
packaging size while remaining simple and effective.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A torque-transfer assembly includes a fluid transfer tube located<br>
within a bore of a shaft. The fluid transfer tube seals to the shaft and includes at<br>
least one fluid groove that communicates between a plurality of fluid ports<br>
located in the shaft. The fluid groove is defined by an outer surface of the fluid<br>
transfer tube.<br>
[0006] One embodiment of the torque-transfer assembly includes a<br>
shaft having an inner surface that defines a bore, the bore defining an axis,<br>
wherein the shaft has a first fluid port that communicates a fluid to the bore and a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br><br>
[0026] With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary shaft or torque-transfer<br>
assembly is illustrated and indicated by reference number 10. In the example<br>
provided, the torque transfer assembly 10 is a turbine shaft assembly used in a<br>
transmission, however it should be appreciated that various other shafts may be<br>
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The torque<br>
transfer assembly 10 defines a linear axis 11 and includes a generally cylindrical<br>
shaft portion 12 having an outer surface 14 and an inner surface 16. The inner<br>
surface 16 defines a bore 18 that is coaxial to the axis 11. The bore 18<br>
communicates with an opening 20 located in a terminal end of the shaft portion<br>
12. The outer surface 14 includes a plurality of fluid ports, indicated by reference<br>
numbers 26A-26F, that communicate between the outer surface 14 of the torque<br>
transfer assembly 10 and the bore 18. The fluid ports 26A-F are preferably<br>
spaced along a length of the shaft portion 12, though the locations of the fluid<br>
ports 26A-F on the outer surface 14 may vary without departing from the scope<br>
of the present invention. Additionally, the number of fluid ports 26A-F may vary<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. The fluid ports 26A-F<br>
are operable to receive one or more fluid flows of a pressurized hydraulic fluid,<br>
such as oil. A plurality of radial seals 26 are seatingly engaged to the outer<br>
surface 14 and to a sleeve (not shown) or other structure that supports the torque<br>
transfer assembly 10. The radial seals 28 are located surrounding each of the<br>
fluid ports 20A-F to hydraulically isolate each of the fluid ports 20A-F. The outer<br>
surface 14 may include various other features, such as gear teeth 30 for<br><br>
engaging a gear (not shown), without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0027] With reference to FIG. 2 and 3A and continued reference to<br>
FIG. 1, a fluid transfer tube, generally indicated by reference number 50, is<br>
employed to transfer the hydraulic fluid flows between the fluid ports 26A-F. The<br>
fluid transfer tube 50 includes a generally cylindrical, tubular portion 52 having an<br>
inner surface 54, an outer surface 56, a first end 58, and a second end 60. The<br>
tubular portions 52 defines a longitudinal axis 61. The inner surface 54 defines a<br>
central passage 62 that is coaxial with the axis 61. The central passage 62<br>
communicates with a first opening 64 located in the first end 58 and with a<br>
second opening 66 located in the second end 60.<br>
[0028] With reference to FIGS. 3B and 4, the outer surface 56 defines<br>
a plurality of fluid grooves including a first fluid groove 70A, a second fluid groove<br>
70B, and a third fluid groove 70C. The fluid grooves 70A-C extend parallel to the<br>
axis of the tubular portion 52. In the particular example provided, the fluid<br>
transfer tube 50 includes three fluid grooves 70A-C sized and spaced to<br>
communicate with the exemplary number and location of the fluid ports 26A-F in<br>
the torque transfer assembly 10, though any number of fluid grooves 70 may be<br>
included without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0029] The fluid grooves A-C are each defined by a curved bottom<br>
surface 72 that is formed from indenting or pushing inward the outer surface 56<br>
into the central passage 62. As best seen in FIG. 3B, the curved bottom<br>
surfaces 72 each have a constant thickness and a curved cross-sectional area.<br><br>
Additionally, the fluid grooves 70A-C 'have a top surface defined by the inner<br>
surface 16 of the shaft 12. The fluid grooves 70A-C extend into the tubular<br>
portion 52 to a predefined depth "d" and width "w" and have a predefined length<br>
"L". Accordingly, each of the fluid grooves 70A-C may have different depths and<br>
widths to accommodate various amounts of fluid flow and different lengths to<br>
accommodate the locations of the various fluid ports 26A-F, as will be described<br>
in further detail below. For example, the first fluid groove 70A has a smaller<br>
width V and depth "d" than the second and third fluid grooves 70B, 70C.<br>
Additionally, the fluid grooves 70A-C are spaced equally circumferentially apart<br>
along the outer surface 56 in the example provided.<br>
[0030] The fluid transfer tube 50 is sized to be press fitted within the<br>
bore 18 of the torque transfer assembly 10. More specifically, the fluid transfer<br>
tube 50 is inserted within the bore 18 such that either the first end 58 or the<br>
second end 60 of the fluid transfer tube 50 abuts an end or stepped portion of the<br>
bore 18. As the fluid transfer tube 50 is pressed fitted in the bore 18, the fluid<br>
transfer tube 50 deflects which induces a compressive strain that seals the outer<br>
surface 56 of the fluid transfer tube 50 to the inner surface 16 of the torque<br>
transfer assembly 10. The fluid transfer tube 50 may be held in place by a snap<br>
ring (not shown), though various other methods of securing the fluid transfer tube<br>
50 within the torque transfer assembly 10 may be employed without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0031] In the particular example provided, the fluid transfer tube 50 is<br>
aligned or oriented with the shaft portion 12 such that the first fluid groove 70A is<br><br>
aligned and communicates with fluid ports 26A and 266, the second fluid groove<br>
70B is aligned and communicates with fluid ports 26D and 26F, and the third fluid<br>
channel 70C is aligned and communicates with fluid ports 26C and 26E.<br>
Accordingly, fluid flow entering one of the fluid ports 26A, 26C, 26D passes into a<br>
fluid groove 70A-C in communication with the fluid ports 26A, 26C, 26D and is<br>
communicated along the length of the fluid transfer tube 50 to exit at one of the<br>
fluid ports 26B, 26E, 26F. Therefore, the length "L" of any given fluid groove<br>
70A-C is at least equal to the distance between any two fluid ports 26A, 26C,<br>
26D and 26B, 26E, 26F that communicate with the given fluid groove 70A-C. It<br>
should be appreciated that the fluid flows may communicate in any direction<br>
through the torque transfer assembly 10 and the fluid transfer tube 50 without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0032] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
