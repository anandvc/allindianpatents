SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thisinvention intends to provide an oral pharmaceutical form which is also suitable for the administration of a pain-relieving product such as, for example, flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. A ready release of the active ingredient is therefore required to these pharmaceutical forms. Orally dispersible tablets or granulates have this feature but also have the disadvantage that the ready release of the active ingredient in the mouth makes it unsuitable for those active ingredients which have a very unpleasant taste such as, for example, flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. This invention also intends to provide a method for the preparation of an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form and an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form which readily releases the drug and which has good palatabilHy even when the active ingredient has a very unpleasant taste.<br>
These problems have been overcome by the method and the orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form according to this invention.<br><br>
In a first aspect this invention provides a process for the preparation of an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form comprising the following steps:<br>
a.	coating the active ingredient with at least one hydrophilic carboxylate<br>
polymer,<br>
b.	granulating the coated active ingredient obtained in step (a) with at<br>
least one lipid compound having a melting point lower than that of the<br>
active ingredient,<br>
c.	mixing the granulate obtained in step (b) with at least one hydrophilic<br>
natural polymer having high molecular weight, and<br>
d.	mixing the granulate obtained in step (c) with ingredients suitable for<br>
obtaining an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form.<br>
In a second aspect this invention provides an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form comprising an active ingredient coated with at least one hydrophilic carboxylate polymer and at least one lipid compound in which said coated active ingredient is embedded in a matrix comprising at least one hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight<br>
In this description and the appended claims the term "orally dispersible" is intended to mean any solid administration unit which disaggregates spontaneously in the presence of water or saliva, such a disaggregation being possibly improved by chewing or dispersion, in less than 1.5 minutes, preferably in less than 1 minute, and even more preferably in less than 30 seconds.<br>
In turn, the expression "hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight" is intended to mean a hydrophilic polymer that has been obtained from a plant or an animal and has a molar weight higher than 1,000. Preferably, higher than 10,000 and, still preferably higher than 100,000.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	coating the active ingredient with at least one hydrophilic carboxylate polymer,<br>
b)	granulating the coated active ingredient obtained in step (a) with at least one lipid compound having a melting point lower than that of the active ingredient,<br>
c)	mixing the granulate obtained in step (b) with at least one hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight, and<br>
d)	mixing the granulate obtained in step (c) with ingredients suitable for obtaining an orally dispersible solid pharmaceutical form.<br>
In a preferred aspect of this invention the solid pharmaceutical form is a tablet or a granulate.<br>
Therefore, where it is desired to obtain tablets which will disperse in the mouth, the method according to this invention preferably comprises a further step (e) of compression of the formulation obtained in step (d).<br>
In the case of a granulate, this may be directly subdivided into dosage units and packed in sachets or any other suitable type of packaging.<br>
In this description and the appended claims, granules of active ingredient coated with at least one hydrophilic carboxylate polymer will be identified by the name of "microcapsules".<br>
The microcapsules according to this invention mask the taste of the active ingredient, coated in this way, but allow ready release of the same.<br>
Preferably, while making it possible to mask the taste of the active ingredient, step a) makes possible to obtain a rate of dissolution of the active ingredient which is greater than the dissolution of the active ingredient as such.<br><br>
Subsequent step b) substantially improves the palatability of the preparation. This step may include a reduction in the rate of dissolution of the active ingredient without however going below the rate of dissolution of the active ingredient as such.<br>
Preferably step c) further improves masking of the taste of the active ingredient without altering its rate of release.<br>
The main purpose of subsequent steps d) and e) is to mix the various components together by direct mixing, and subsequent compression thereof by direct compression where orally dispersible tablets are being prepared, or to subdivide them into dosing units for the subsequent packaging step where orally dispersible granulates are being prepared.<br>
Any active ingredient having an unpleasant taste may be used in connection with this invention. Preferably this invention is used to improve the palatability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory active ingredients (known also by the acronym NSAID, "Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug"), such as, for example, salicylic acid derivatives such as, for example, salicylamide, sodium salicylate, aspirin, mesalamine, sulfasalazine, and methyl salicylate, pyrazolone derivatives such as, for example, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, antipyrine, aminopyrine, dipyrone and apazone (azapropazone), para-aminophenol derivatives such as, for example, phenacetin and acetaminophen (paracetamol), derivatives of N-phenylanthranylic acid, known as fenamates, such as for example mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, etofenamic acid, and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, and propionic acid derivatives such as, for example, ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, phenoprofen, ketoprofen, phenbufen, pirprofen, oxaprozine, indoprofen and tiaprofenic acid. Each of the abovementioned NSAID is extensively described in the literature as, for example, in Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (8th edition), McGraw-Hill,<br><br>
1993, pages 638-381, in the Merck Index, 12™ Edition 1996, Merck &amp; Co. Inc., New Jersey, USA, in Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 1 Lambeth High Street, London SE1 7JN, UK, and in the US, British and European Pharmacopoeias.<br>

The polymer which is preferred for use in this invention is hyroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, in particular the commercial products HP-50™ and HP-55™ from the company Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd, Japan. These commerciaf products are characterised in that they contain hydroxypropyl residues (from 5 to 10 molar %), methoxy residues (from 18 to 24 molar %), phthalyl residues (from 21 to 35 molar %) and by their molecular weight (about 80,000 ± 10,000).<br>
The preferred hydrophilic carboxylate polymer according to this invention is selected from the group comprising hemiesters of dicarboxylic acids with alkyl cellulose.<br>
Typically, said hydrophilic carboxylate polymer is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate or succinate.<br><br>
Preferably, the weight ratio between the active ingredient and said hydrophilic carboxylate polymer is comprised between 60:40 and 99.9 : 0.1, More preferably, said ratio ranges from 75:25 to 99:1, Typically, this ranges from 85:15 to 95:5.

Typically, this ranges from 85:15 to 95:5- Thus, the parts by weight of lipid compound added for each part by weight of active ingredient preferably range from 0.33 to 0.001, more preferably from 0.25 to 0,01, even more preferably again from 0.175 to 0.05,<br><br>
The hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight which may be used according to this invention is preferably selected from the group comprising guar gum, arabic gum, karaya gum, gelano gum, carrageenan, chitosan, galactan, Polglumyt™ (the trade name of a deproteinated fraction of glycogen produced and distributed by A.C.R.A.F. S.pA Rome, Italy, and described in patent EP 654,048), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The particularly preferred hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight according to this invention is guar gum.<br>
Preferably the weight ratio between the active ingredient and the hydrophilic natural polymer having high molecular weight (or mixtures thereof) is comprised between 75:25 and 99.9 :0.1. More preferably, said ratio ranges from 80:20 to 99.5 : 0.5. Typically this ranges from 85:15 to 99:1.

The following examples will illustrate this invention without however in any way restricting it.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PART Materials and methods Dissolution Test The test was carried out in phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 (obtained by dissolving 6.8 g of KH2 P04 and 1.4 g of NaOH in 1 litre of demineralised water) at 100 rpm for the microcapsule dissolution test and 50 rpm for the tablet dissolution test according to the method described in European Pharmacopoeia, Ed. 4.4 of the 04/2003.<br>
Evaluation of Palatability A certain amount of the product under test was administered to 5 different individuals sensitive to the irritating action of ibuprofen. Previously, they had been given a form and they had been asked to indicate on the form their assessment of the palatability of the product administered at the time when it was placed in the mouth (t0), during swallowing (ti), after swallowing (t2) and after 5 minutes (fe) on the basis of the following parameters: Stimulus:      Description: Burning        Sensation caused by abrasion of the skin, or by exposure<br>
to high temperature, or to the irritant action of alcohol; Prickling       Production of a short sensation like an insect bite or pins, Tingling        A sensation similar to that due to the action of small<br>
penetrating needles, Dullness      A diffuse sensation like the onset of the action of an<br>
anaesthetic (not lack of feeling), Sandiness   Prolonged sensation similar to the presence of grains of sand in the mouth. The 5 individuals were also asked to say whether the stimulus was strong (3), medium (2), weak (1) or zero (0).<br><br>
The palatability of the product under test was therefore worse the higher the abovementioned numerical value associated with the stimulus felt by the individuals subjected to the test.<br>

Abbreviations<br>
In the examples below, the following abbreviations have the following meanings:<br>
AI = Active Ingredient HCP = Hydrophilic Carboxylate Polymer LC = Lipid Compound MC1 = Microcapsules of Example 1 MC2 = Microcapsules of Example 2 MC3 = Microcapsules of Example 3 GR1 = Granulate 1 GR2 = Granulate 2 GR3 = Granulate 3 GR4 = Granulate 4<br><br>
Ratios Where not indicated otherwise, the ratios between Al and HCP or LC are intended to be ratios by weight.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of Microcapsules (Al: HCP = 95:5)<br>
95.00 g of Ibuprofen BP 80, 5.00 g of HP-55™ polymer and 0.75 g of KOH were used.<br>
A solution of potassium hydroxide in demineralised water (about 60 ml) was prepared in a first container. The HP-55™ was added to that solution until completely dissolved. In another container a suspension of Ibuprofen BP 80 was prepared in demineralised water (500 ml) and the suspension so obtained was homogenised. The solution was then added to the suspension under continuous stirring. The so obtained mixture was made acid with 1N HCI, maintaining stirring at all times, until a pH value of from 2.5 to 2.9 was obtained. The microcapsules which precipitated out during acidification were collected on a filter and then manually placed on a tray.<br>
The so obtained particles were dried in a static bed oven by forced hot air at 40°C for some hours. Finally, the particles were placed on a 30 mesh (600 micron) sieve and those which passed through that sieve were collected.<br>
Example 2 Preparation of Microcapsules (Al: HCP = 90:10)<br>
The preparation was carried out in a similar way to that described in Example 1 above by using 630.00 g of Ibuprofen BP 80, 70.00 g of HP-55™, 11.00 g of KOH, 0.63 g of saccharose monopalmitate and 1.26 g of dimethicone.<br>
A solution of potassium hydroxide in demineralised water (about 820 ml) was prepared in a first container and then HP-55™ was added until complete dissolution. A suspension of the active ingredient in<br><br>
demineralised water (about 3500 ml) to which the saccharose monopalmitate and the dimethicone had previously been added was prepared in another container and the suspension so obtained was homogenised. The procedure was then continued as described in Example 1.<br>
Example 3 Preparation of Microcapsules (Al: HCP = 75:25) The preparation was carried out in a similar way to that described in Example 2 above using 525.00 g of ibuprofen BP 80, 175.00 g of HP-55™, 26.80 g of KOH, 0.54 g of saccharose monopalmitate and 1.08 g of dimethicone.<br>
Example 4 Microcapsule Releasing Test The microcapsules obtained in Examples 1 to 3 (MC1, MC2 and MC3) were subjected to the releasing test in phosphate buffer by means of a UV spectrophotometer. The percentages of Al released between 0 and 45 minutes are shown in the table below. In order to assist comparison the results obtained on Al as such in the same test are shown in the bottom line (see previous Experimental Part).<br><br>
improves releasing times for the active ingredient as if the HCP was acting as a surfactant The effect of the HCP was substantially the same for all experimental quantities of HCP.<br><br>
Example 5 Palatability of Microcapsules Microcapsules MC1, MC2 and MC3 were subjected to the palatability test carried out with the same persons and the same procedures as described previously, with the administration of an amount of microcapsules containing 200 mg of the active ingredient. The results are shown in the tables below.<br><br><br>
  r<br>
Example 6 Preparation Granulates MCI and MC2 were granulated with cetyl alcohol as the lipid compound (LC) in order to increase the taste-masking effect and improve compressibility. Granulation was carried out in a Rotolab rotary granulator from the Zanchetta company, Lucca, Italy.<br><br>
jacket temperature of the rotary granulator to a value such that softening of the LC was attained without however damaging the structure of the microcapsules. In the particular cases of Granulates 1-4 the jacket temperature was set to 50°C.<br>
Then, the microcapsules and the cetyl alcohol which had previously been milled and passed through a 30 mesh (600 pirn) sieve were poured into the chamber of the rotary granulator. The powders were mixed for at least 180 seconds, with the mixing paddle speed set to 700 rpm. Heating of the granulator jacket was then begun, setting the temperature to 50°C. Stirring was continued until the product temperature reached 47°C.<br>
The granulation process was interrupted a few minutes after that said temperature had been reached.<br><br>
Finally, after cooling to room temperature the granulate so obtained was sifted on a 20 mesh (850 jam) sieve.<br>
Payability of the granulate is further improved when the granulation process is carried out as follows:<br>
1)	heating under stirring the whole amount of cetyl alcohol up to melting and subsequent cooling;<br>
2)	suspending MC1f MC2 or MC3 in a reactor provided with a stirring blade;<br>
3)	adding cetyl alcohol from step 1) to the suspension of step 2) and subsequent mixing;<br>
4)	cooling the suspension obtained in step 3);<br>
5)	filtering the suspension obtained in fase 4).<br>
Example 7 Releasing Test on Granulates A releasing test in phosphate buffer of from 0 to 30 minutes was carried out on four granulates GR1-GR4 by means of HPLC analysis.<br>

The preparation was carried out by first mixing A with B and C.<br>
The other ingredients were mixed separately and sifted through a 14 mesh (1400 pm) sieve.<br><br>
Then, the first mixture of A, B and C was mixed with the second mixture of the other ingredients to obtain a homogeneous dispersion with good flow properties.<br>
Finally, the so obtained mixture was compressed by means of an alternating tabletting machine.<br>
Tablets having an average hardness of 2.4 Kp and a weight of 1.4 g each were produced in this way. Each tablet contained 200 mg of ibuprofen.<br>
