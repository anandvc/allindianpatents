				<td>A FLEXIBLE CEILING PANEL AND A CEILING SYSTEM INCORPORATING<br>
THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a flexible ceiling panel and a ceiling system<br>
incorporating the same. This invention further relates to coverings for the ceilings and<br>
walls of building structures and, more particularly, to a drop ceiling or a wall panel<br>
wherein individual panels are supported on a matrix of support members.<br>
Description of the Relevant Art<br>
The ceilings of building structures have taken numerous forms. Ceilings may be<br>
left unfinished so that rafters or beams of the building structure itself are exposed or the<br>
rafters and beams may be covered as with drywall, wood strips, plaster or other similar<br>
finishes. Walls of building structures may be similarly finished.<br>
Another popular ceiling system is commonly referred to as a drop ceiling where a<br>
plurality of support bars are suspended from the unfinished ceiling so as to form a<br>
matrix having a plurality of side-by-side openings defined between the support bars. The<br>
openings are filled with panels which are typically rigid acoustical panels, with the panels<br>
being supported along their peripheral edge by the support bars. While such drop<br>
ceilings have met with some success, there are numerous disadvantages. One<br>
disadvantage is that there is very little variety in the aesthetics of the ceiling system<br>
since most acoustical panels have the same general appearance, with another<br>
disadvantage residing in the fact that the panels are rigid and brittle so that they are<br>
easily breakable and, further, due to their rigidity, they are difficult to insert into the<br>
opening provided therefor in as much as the support bars must partially protrude into the<br>
opening in order to provide a support surface for the panels.<br>
It is to overcome the shortcomings in prior art drop ceiling systems and to provide<br>
a new and improved cladding system for walls or ceilings that the present invention has<br>
been made.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to a new and improved drop ceiling system<br>
wherein a plurality of flexible panels are preferably removably supported on a grid work<br>
of support bars. The support bars may be of inverted T-shaped cross-sectional<br>
configuration and form a matrix from longitudinally extending stringers and laterally<br>
extending cross-members. The flexible panels are sized to fit within the openings defined<br>
by the stringers and cross-members and rest upon ledges of the inverted T-shaped support<br>
members.<br>
The panels can take numerous configurations but include at least one sheet of<br>
somewhat rigid but flexible or foldable material preferably made of a fibrous material<br>
that is reinforced in one of numerous ways so that it can be folded or flexed while being<br>
inserted into an opening in the supporting grid work and subsequently unfolded above the<br>
grid work so that it can be easily positioned on the supporting grid work. In various<br>
disclosed embodiments, the panel can be made to be collapsible or compressible.<br>
The sheet material can be reinforced by a second parallel sheet of material with<br>
support members bridging the space therebetween or it may be reinforced simply by a<br>
plurality of reinforcing members extended along an unexposed, or possibly even exposed,<br>
surface of the sheet material. Where multiple sheets of material are utilized, support<br>
members are provided for retaining the sheet materials in a desired spaced relationship.<br>
The panels so formed provide adequate insulation and also, in most instances,<br>
provide an exposed planar surface that can be covered with a decorative film of various<br>
colors, grains or textural patterns to provide variety to the aesthetics of the ceiling system<br>
once it has been installed.<br>
While the panels have been summarized and will be described hereafter in more<br>
detail as forming part of a ceiling system, it will be apparent tp those skilled in the art that<br>
with modification of the support system the panels could also be used in the walls of a<br>
building structure.<br>
Other aspects, features and details of the present invention can be more<br>
completely understood by reference to the following detailed description of a preferred<br>
embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and from the<br>
invention as hereinafter claimed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A drop ceiling system 100 in accordance with the present invention utilizes a<br>
conventional suspension system of elongated crisscrossing support members 102 forming<br>
a matrix defining openings that are usually rectangular in shape in which a panel in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be disposed. The support members typically<br>
consist of horizontally disposed elongated stringers 102a that are suspended in a<br>
conventional manner and in parallel relationship in one direction across a ceiling<br>
structure usually at a vertical spacing of four to six inches from the substructure of the<br>
building structure in which the ceiling system is mounted. A plurality of horizontal<br>
cross-support members 102b extend in parallel relationship and perpendicularly to the<br>
stringers so that the quadrangular openings are defined therebetween. The cross-<br>
members are also suspended at the same elevation as the stringers. The stringers and<br>
cross-members are of inverted T-shaped cross-section as illustrated in Fig. 3 so as to<br>
define horizontal shoulders 104 on either side of a vertical body 106, with the shoulders<br>
being adapted to support a peripheral edge of a panel formed in accordance with the<br>
present invention. As will be appreciated, the T-shaped support members 102 extend<br>
peripherally around each quadrangular opening so that a shoulder is provided to support<br>
an entire peripheral edge of a panel.<br>
Other types of suspension systems could be utilized, but a suspension system of<br>
the type described has proven to be very functional.<br>
A first embodiment 108 of a panel in accordance with the present invention is<br>
illustrated in Figs. 1-17. As probably best seen in Fig. 5, each panel 108 includes an<br>
upper planar sheet 110, a lower planar sheet 112 and a plurality of parallel reinforcement<br>
members 114 of substantially S-shaped cross-section. The upper and lower planar<br>
sheets as well as the reinforcement members are made of a somewhat rigid material<br>
that can be flexed. A material that has worked for this purpose is a non-woven fabric of<br>
heat resistant fibers bound together by a heat moldable polymeric resin matrix or a<br>
thermal setting resin matrix. For example, fiberglass fibers embedded in an acrylic resin<br>
will work for this purpose with the fibers preferably being relatively long and thin. The<br>
length of the glass fibers would be at least 1/4 inch, but preferably !4 inch and especially<br>
at least one inch. The thickness of the glass fibers would be no less than 7 microns and<br>
no more than 100 microns but preferably no more than 32 microns and especially 10-16<br>
microns. A material found suitable for this purpose is 100GSM glass mat #8802<br>
manufactured by Johns Manville of Waterville, Ohio, or an alternative would be<br>
materials available from OJI Glasspen in Japan and Ahlstrom in Finland.<br>
The upper and lower sheets of material are cut to a predetermined size which<br>
corresponds with the area defined by the stringers 102a and cross-members 102b of<br>
the support system. As will be appreciated, the upper and lower sheets of material are<br>
retained in a parallel and separated relationship by the reinforcement members 114<br>
which are formed from elongated strips of material 116 that are pre-creased at<br>
predetermined locations so that they can be folded at right angles at those locations.<br>
The strips of material are also cut to pre-determined lengths to form the reinforcement<br>
members.<br>
The creases are provided at the locations where the strip material 116 is to be<br>
folded and these locations are spaced from each edge of the strip approximately one-<br>
quarter of the full width of the strip. In this manner, when the strips are folded as<br>
illustrated in Figs. 5 and 11, they define an upper flap 124 and a lower flap 126 and an<br>
intermediate body 128 which is approximately twice the width of each of the flaps.<br>
The crease lines, of course, allow the flaps to be folded relative to the<br>
intermediate body. By taking care when creasing the strips that the glass fibers<br>
not be damaged, alternative means for maintaining resiliency in the strip<br>
material need not be employed as the glass fibers provide the desired<br>
resiliency in the material. Each flap is provided with an adhesive on its<br>
outer surface to engage the adjacent sheet material 110 or 112 so as to be securely<br>
bonded thereto. The adhesive could take numerous forms but a porous adhesive<br>
made by EMS-Chemie AG of Domat/Ems, Switzerland and designated flame resistant<br>
co-polyester adhesive #1533 has been found acceptable.<br>
As will be appreciated, due to the creases in the reinforcement members, and the<br>
capability of the strip material 116 to bend along these creases, the reinforcement<br>
members by themselves may not necessarily retain the sheet material 110, 112 in spaced<br>
relationship rendering the panel collapsible by moving the sheets of material toward each<br>
other while they slightly shift laterally relating to each other. To prevent collapsing,<br>
diagonal support members 130 of a more rigid plastic material or conceivably the same<br>
glass fiber reinforced resin material maybe diagonally inserted into each cell 132 defined<br>
between the sheet material and adjacent reinforcement members. These support members<br>
130 are illustrated in dashed lines in Fig. 5 and in full lines in Fig. 7. The support<br>
members can be inserted in every cell or in spaced cells as is necessary to support the<br>
panel as desired. Even with the support members inserted in each cell, however, the<br>
panel can be slightly flexed or bent as illustrated in Figs. 11 or 12. As will be<br>
appreciated, due to the flexibility of the panels, they can be easily inserted into the<br>
openings between the stringers 102a and cross-members 102b even though the overall<br>
fully extended size of the panel 108 is substantially equal to the size of that opening.<br>
This, of course, provides a distinct advantage over systems in the prior art where rigid<br>
panels that could not be bent or flexed have to be inserted into an opening of about the<br>
same size.<br>
By inserting support members at specified selected locations, but not in all the<br>
cells, the panel will take a curved shape that may be useful or appealing in some<br>
situations.<br>
The reinforcement members 114 can be adhesively bonded to the sheet material<br>
110,112 in any suitable manner but, by way of example, the adhesive could be provided<br>
to cover the entire face of a flap 124 or 126, could be provided in continuous lines along<br>
the flap but not of the full width of the flap, could be provided in intermittent lines along<br>
the flap or other such applications. It is conceivable that the reinforcement member could<br>
also be heat welded or ultrasonically bonded to the sheet material as well.<br>
It will be appreciated by reference to Figs. 8-10 that by removing the support<br>
strips 130 from each cell, the panel 108 can be collapsed by folding the reinforcement<br>
members 114 along their creases 122 so that the reinforcement members are flattened and<br>
extend in parallel relationship with the upper and lower sheets 110 and 112, respectively,<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 9. In this configuration, panels can be stacked as illustrated in Fig.<br>
10 into a small area for shipping purposes thereby saving considerable expense when<br>
shipping panels for use in a drop ceiling system.<br>
With reference to Fig. 13, it will be appreciated that the panel 108 as described<br>
above can be modified by incorporating a decorative continuous layer of elastomeric<br>
polymer, preferably a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymeric film 134 or the like, such<br>
as a urethane or neoprene film, to the lower exposed face of the lower sheet 112, which<br>
face is the face that is exposed to the interior of the room in which the ceiling system is<br>
mounted. The film material can be simply a flat sheet of colored material, could be<br>
furrowed or otherwise embossed with a pattern, or could have a wood grain or other<br>
decorative pattern imprinted thereon. There are numerous possibilities for decorating the<br>
lower surface of the panel and this film or related sheet of material can be adhesively or<br>
otherwise secured to the panel along the bottom face of the lower sheet of material 112<br>
of the panel. A decorative film as described above or other material may also be applied<br>
to the other panel embodiments of this invention, which are described below.<br>
Examples of decorative coverings or films would be:<br>
a) supported vinyl wall coverings made by Gen Corp. of Columbus, Miss.<br>
b) unsupported vinyl films as used in wrapping operations from Alkor Draka<br>
of<br>
Munich, Germany.<br>
c) flame resistant papers made by Pallas Inc. of Green Bay, Wisconsin.<br>
d) flame resistant papers made by Permalin Products Co. of New York, New<br>

e) woven fiberglass mat from Johns Manville of Waterville, Ohio.<br>
f) a flame resistant non-woven #TR2315B-1 from H &amp; V of Floyd, VA<br>
which has been quilted by Hunter Douglas Inc. of Broomfield, Colorado.<br>
g) a flame resistant glass paint on a glass non-woven fabric with the paint<br>

As an alternative to the diagonal support members shown in dashed lines in Fig.<br>
5, elongated end caps 136 as shown in Figs. 15-17 could be utilized. These end caps<br>
could simply be elongated U-shaped channel members of a rigid material which are<br>
adapted to fit snugly over the end of the aforedescribed panel 108 in perpendicular<br>
relationship to the longitudinal direction of the reinforcement members 114. As will be<br>
appreciated, the end caps prevent the panel from collapsing, as illustrated in Figs. 8 and<br>
9, and, of course, could be removed from the panel for shipping purposes and installed<br>
on the panel once the panels were ready for installation in a ceiling system. As an<br>
alternative the end caps could also be slit to fit within the open end of the panel instead<br>
of around the end. By way of example, the end caps could be made of a flame resistant<br>
polycarbonate or aluminum and adhesively secured to the panels 108.<br>
Figs. 18-20 illustrate a second embodiment 138 of a panel in accordance with the<br>
present invention wherein a lower sheet material 140 is reinforced principally in one<br>
direction by a furrowed reinforcing sheet 142 that is folded as illustrated in Fig. 19 to<br>
define upwardly and downwardly opening trapezoidal channels 144. The trapezoidal<br>
channels would be bonded where the reinforcement member is in contiguous abutting<br>
face-to-face relationship with the lower sheet material 140. As mentioned previously, the<br>
bonding could be done in any variety of ways so long as a positive bond was provided<br>
between the reinforcing member and the lower sheet material. As will be appreciated,<br>
with an arrangement of this type, the panel can be flexed upwardly in a smooth curve, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 18, and to a smaller degree downwardly but only in one direction of the<br>
panel. The trapezoidal channels 144 substantially prevent flexing in a transverse<br>
direction to that illustrated. This ability to flex the panel, however, allows the panel to<br>
be easily inserted into the opening between the stringers 102a and cross-members 102b<br>
in the support structure for the ceiling system. The stiffness of the panel can also be<br>
adjusted by the stiffness or rigidity of the lower sheet material 140.<br>
In a third embodiment 146 of the present invention, seen in Figs. 21-30, the<br>
ceiling panel 146 is formed similarly to the panel illustrated in Figs. 18-20 but wherein<br>
an upper sheet material 148 is secured to the trapezoidal reinforcement member 142<br>
along the top surface of the trapezoidal member. The upper sheet material can be<br>
adhesively bonded or otherwise secured to the reinforcement member in the same or<br>
similar manner as the reinforcement member was secured to the lower sheet material 140.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 24, the bonding of the reinforcement member 142 to the sheet<br>
material can be with a full layer of adhesive 150 or, as illustrated in Fig. 25, with a single<br>
line of adhesive 150 or, as illustrated in Fig. 26, with parallel lines of adhesive 150 or,<br>
as mentioned previously, many other methods of applying adhesive such as intermittently<br>
or in dots or the like could also be employed. Again, heat welding or ultrasonic bonding<br>
may also be appropriate.<br>
The completed panel 146 is probably best seen in Fig. 23 and, again, will bend<br>
or flex in one direction of the panel but is substantially prevented from flexing in a lateral<br>
or perpendicular direction due to the trapezoidally shaped channels of the reinforcement<br>
member 142. The reinforcement member can be formed from a sheet of material that has<br>
been creased in opposite faces at spaced parallel locations and subsequently folded.<br>
The panel 146 can be compressed for shipping purposes, as illustrated in Figs. 27-<br>
30, with a slight amount of compression probably not appreciably changing the<br>
configuration of the panel other than to make it slightly thinner, but further compression<br>
causing the straight faces 160 of the reinforcement member to buckle or fold into the<br>
contoured configuration shown in Fig. 29. Accordingly, the panels can be forcibly<br>
compressed for shipping purposes so as not to occupy as much space within a shipping<br>
container and by utilizing an appropriate material for the panels, such as a glass<br>
reinforced resin as described previously, the panels will reassume their normal<br>
configuration of Figs. 21 and 22.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, the term "compression" refers to reducing<br>
the thickness of a panel without allowing the upper and lower sheets to shift laterally<br>
relative to each other while the term "collapsing" refers to reducing the thickness of a<br>
panel while permitting lateral shifting of the upper and lower sheets relative to each other.<br>
If there were no upper sheet, such as in the embodiment shown in Figs. 18-20,<br>
"compression" would occur if the furrowed reinforcing sheet were not allowed to fold<br>
laterally as if it were "collapsing" but rather was buckled straight downwardly.<br>
Fig. 31 illustrates a fourth embodiment 162 of the present invention where, again,<br>
upper and lower planar sheets of material 164 and 166, respectively, are separated by a<br>
furrowed reinforcement member 168 that defines upwardly and downwardly opening<br>
channels 170 of trapezoidal cross-section but in this embodiment of the invention, the<br>
engagement area of the reinforcement member 168 with each planar sheet member 164,<br>
166 is less than the corresponding engagement areas of the panel shown in Figs. 21 and<br>
22. This allows for a more compressible panel and as will be appreciated, by varying the<br>
area of engagement between the reinforcement member and the planar sheet members,<br>
the compressibility of the panel can be regulated. Fig. 33 shows the panel 162 in a<br>
somewhat compressed configuration but when utilizing appropriate resilient materials,<br>
the panel will return to the normal configuration illustrated in Fig. 32 upon the release of<br>
pressure due to the resiliency of the material utilized.<br>
Figs. 35-38 illustrate a fifth embodiment 172 of the present invention which is<br>
somewhat similar to those shown in Figs. 21-22 and 31-32 so as to include upper and<br>
lower sheets of planar material 174 and 176, respectively, and a reinforcing member 178<br>
therebetween but wherein the reinforcing member is defined by upwardly and<br>
downwardly opening channels 180 that are of substantially triangular configuration. In<br>
this arrangement, the engagement of the reinforcing member 178 with each planar sheet<br>
material 174,176 is a relatively small area which allows even more compressibility of<br>
the panel. Fig. 35A is an enlargement of the circled area in Fig. 36 and shows a line of<br>
adhesive 182 along a substantially pointed line of engagement of the reinforcement<br>
member 178 with the upper planar sheet member 174.<br>
A sixth embodiment 184 of the panel of the present invention is illustrated in<br>
Figs. 39-41 and can be seen to include a lower planar sheet material 186, a primary<br>
reinforcement member 188 substantially of the type shown in Fig. 18, and a secondary<br>
reinforcement member 190 overlaid on the primary reinforcement member 188.<br>
The primary reinforcement member 188 defines upwardly and downwardly<br>
opening channels 192 of trapezoidal cross-sectional configuration and is bonded to the<br>
lower planar sheet material 186 along areas of engagement 194. The secondary<br>
reinforcement member 190 is overlaid across the top of the primary reinforcement<br>
member and also defines upwardly and downwardly opening channels 196 of trapezoidal<br>
configuration but wherein the upwardly opening channels are wider than the downwardly<br>
opening channels. The downwardly opening channels are sized to conform with and<br>
receive the uppermost structure of a downwardly opening channel of the primary<br>
reinforcement member 188. The upwardly opening channels of the secondary<br>
reinforcement member 190 are adapted to be received in an upwardly opening channel<br>
of the primary reinforcement member. The secondary reinforcement member is secured<br>
to the primary reinforcement member in any suitable manner such as with adhesive and<br>
either continuously or at intermittent locations only along horizontal areas of engagement<br>
198. The panel so formed, again, will flex in one direction but not as readily flex in the<br>
lateral transverse direction and Fig. 45 illustrates the panel when so flexed. It will be<br>
appreciated that the secondary reinforcement member flexes outwardly across the<br>
upwardly opening channels 192 of the primary reinforcement member to allow for the<br>
bend in the panel. This, of course, is permitted due to the fact that the secondary<br>
reinforcement member is not bonded to the primary reinforcement member in the<br>
upwardly opening channels of the primary reinforcement member but only along the top<br>
or horizontal areas of engagement 198 with the primary reinforcement member.<br>
Figs. 42-44 illustrate an alterative arrangement 200 to the panel illustrated in Figs.<br>
39 and 40, with this alternative arrangement being identical to the arrangement shown in<br>
Figs. 39 and 40 but wherein an is bonded to the secondary reinforcement member 190 in<br>
parallel relationship with the lower planar sheet member 186. A panel so formed could<br>
also be bent as illustrated in Fig. 45 A where the planar sheet members 186 and 202 are<br>
illustrated in dashed lines.<br>
Fig. 46 illustrates a seventh embodiment 204 of a panel in accordance with the<br>
present invention wherein the panel 204 includes upper and lower planar sheets of<br>
material 206 and 208, respectively, a primary reinforcement member 210 and a pair of<br>
upper and lower secondary reinforcement members 212 and 214, respectively. The<br>
primary reinforcement member has upwardly and downwardly opening channels 216 of<br>
trapezoidal configuration but the primary reinforcement member is not directly attached<br>
to the planar sheet materials. Rather, the secondary reinforcement members 212 and 214,<br>
respectively, are secured to the primary reinforcement member 210 along horizontal<br>
interfaces 218 between the respective members and, in turn, the secondary reinforcement<br>
members are secured to the planar sheet members along horizontal engagement areas<br>
220. The secondary reinforcement members are identical to each other but inverted<br>
relative to each other so as to be secured to the primary reinforcement member across the<br>
top and bottom thereof substantially as described previously in connection with the<br>
embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 39 and 40.<br>
Figs. 47-56 illustrate an eighth embodiment 222 of the present invention wherein<br>
a pair of parallel planar sheets 224 and 226 are interconnected by a reinforcement<br>
member 228 that includes a primary reinforcement portion 230 and secondary<br>
reinforcement portions 232 which provide rigidity in a transverse direction to the primary<br>
portion. As best illustrated in Figs. 49 and 50, the primary reinforcement portion 230 is<br>
a furrowed member substantially the same as the primary reinforcement member of Fig.<br>
39 thereby defining upwardly and downwardly opening channels 234 of trapezoidal<br>
cross-section. The secondary reinforcement portions 232 are insert strips, as illustrated<br>
in Fig. 49, that are adapted to be received in the upwardly opening channels of the<br>
primary reinforcement portion. Each secondary reinforcement strip has a cross-sectional<br>
configuration substantially identical to that of the primary portion, but the planar side<br>
walls 236 of the strip, which extend perpendicularly to the channels in the primary<br>
reinforcement portion, are tapered so as to converge downwardly thereby to conform with<br>
the downwardly convergent walls 238 of the upwardly opening channels of the primary<br>
portion of the reinforcement member. Accordingly, when the secondary reinforcement<br>
strips are positioned within the upwardly opening channels of the primary reinforcement<br>
portion, the reinforcement member is structured as illustrated in Fig. 50, and it will be<br>
appreciated that the panel has substantial rigidity in both longitudinal and transverse<br>
directions even though a slight degree of flexing is achievable due to the characteristics<br>
of the material from which the reinforcement member is made.<br>
Fig. 51 illustrates a sheet of material 240 from which the secondary reinforcement<br>
portions can be cut and folded and as will be appreciated, a number of such strips 232 can<br>
be cut in a complimentary manner from the same sheet of material.<br>
Figs. 55 and 56 illustrate the compressible nature of the panel 222 which is<br>
permitted due to the flexible nature of the material from which the reinforcement member<br>
228 is made and as will be appreciated, depending upon the amount of pressure applied<br>
to the planar sheet members 224 and 226, the reinforcement members will buckle into<br>
the contoured configuration illustrated allowing the panel to assume a thinner or<br>
shallower cross-section, again, for shipping purposes. In other words, the panels can be<br>
forcibly compressed into containers for shipment so as to occupy a minimal amount of<br>
space compared to that which would be occupied by the fully expanded panel.<br>
Figs. 57-59 illustrate a ninth embodiment 242 of the panel of the present<br>
invention which includes a lower planar sheet of material 244 and a reinforcement<br>
member 246 bonded or otherwise secured to the upper surface thereof to permit easy<br>
flexing of the panel in a downward direction but the reinforcement member resists<br>
flexing of the panel in an upwardly direction and transverse directions. The<br>
reinforcement member has alternate upwardly and downwardly opening channels 248 of<br>
trapezoidal cross-sectional configuration but the opening of each channel is significantly<br>
narrower than the opposed closed side of the same channel. As will be appreciated, the<br>
panel would be allowed to flex readily in a downward direction but not so readily in an<br>
upward direction and not so readily in a transverse direction. The reinforcement member<br>
is secured to the planar sheet material along areas of engagement in any suitable manner<br>
which could include adhesive applied in lines, continuously across the areas of<br>
engagement, along intermittent lines or dots or the like.<br>
A tenth embodiment 250 of a panel formed in accordance with the present<br>
invention is illustrated in Figs. 60-62. In this embodiment, a planar sheet of material 252<br>
is bonded or otherwise secured in a suitable manner to an overlying reinforcement<br>
member 254 that is similar to the reinforcement member shown in the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Fig. 58 but wherein the upwardly opening trapezoidal channels 256 of the<br>
reinforcement member are significantly wider than the downwardly opening channels<br>
258. This arrangement would permit not only flexing in the downward direction but also<br>
more flexing in the upward direction than would be permitted by the embodiment shown<br>
in Figs. 57-59. The lower exposed face of the sheet 252, which face is exposed to the<br>
interior of the room in which the ceiling system is mounted, can be modified by providing<br>
it with a continuous elastomeric polymer (not shown). Preferably, the elastomeric<br>
polymer is a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymeric film, such as a urethane or<br>
neoprene film, as described previously with reference to Fig. 14, or a urethane or<br>
neoprene adhesive that bonds a decorative film, as described above with reference to Fig.<br>
14, on the lower face of the sheet 252. The elastomeric polymer allows the panel 250 to<br>
be substantially flexed or bent without visible creasing of the sheet 252. As a result, the<br>
panel 250 can be manufactured in long lengths which can be stored and shipped in rolled-<br>
up form and then unrolled and cut to length for installation.<br>
An eleventh embodiment 260 of a panel in accordance with the present invention<br>
is illustrated in Figs. 63-65. This embodiment is identical to that illustrated in Figs. 57-<br>
59 except that an upper pianar sheet of material 262 is secured to a reinforcement<br>
member 264 across the top of the reinforcement member in the same or similar manner<br>
to which a bottom sheet material 266 is secured to the lower surface of the reinforcement<br>
member. This panel would have similar behavioral characteristics to that of the panel<br>
illustrated in Fig. 58 but would have slightly more rigidity and better insulating qualities.<br>
Figs. 66-68 illustrate a twelfth embodiment 268 of a panel formed in accordance<br>
with the present invention, with this embodiment including upper and lower planar sheets<br>
of material 270 and 272, respectively, that are secured to and separated by a<br>
reinforcement member 274 having upwardly and downwardly opening channels 276 of<br>
transverse trapezoidal configuration. The reinforcement member is similar to that of Fig.<br>
58 except that the trapezoidal cross-section is slightly enlarged so that the opening of the<br>
trapezoidal channels in both the upward and downward directions is slightly greater than<br>
that of the reinforcement member of Fig. 58.<br>
A thirteenth embodiment 278 of a panel formed in accordance with the present<br>
invention is illustrated in Figs. 69-71, with this panel, including upper and lower planar<br>
sheet materials 280 and 282, respectively, that are interconnected by and spaced by a<br>
reinforcement member 284. The reinforcement member is substantially identical to that<br>
illustrated in the embodiment of Figs. 60 and 61.<br>
Figs. 72-75 illustrate the compressibility of the panel 268 described previously<br>
in connection with Figs. 66-68 and wherein it will be appreciated in Fig. 73 that the panel<br>
can be compressed a slight amount without buckling the resilient walls of the<br>
reinforcement member 274, but additional compression allows the walls of the<br>
reinforcement member to further fold relative to each other into the configuration<br>
illustrated in Fig. 74. The walls will actually buckle so that the panel can be substantially<br>
compressed for cost savings during shipment.<br>
Figs. 76-79 illustrate the compressibility of the panel 260 described previously<br>
in connection with Figs. 63-65 wherein it will again be appreciated that a slight amount<br>
of compression, as seen in Fig. 77, is possible without buckling the resilient walls of the<br>
reinforcement member 264 but additional compression of the panel causes the walls to<br>
buckle and fold, as illustrated in Fig. 78, so that the panel is substantially thinner thereby<br>
occupying less space within a shipping container.<br>
Figs. 80-83 illustrate a sixteenth embodiment 286 of a panel formed in accordance<br>
with the present invention. This panel is very similar to the panel described previously<br>
in Figs. 60-62 in that it includes a lower planar sheet of material 288 and a reinforcing<br>
member 290 with upwardly opening trapezoidal channels 292 spaced by closed triangular<br>
shaped channels 294. As will be appreciated, the upwardly opening channels that are of<br>
trapezoidal cross-sectional configuration define a space 296 along the upper surface of<br>
the reinforcement member between the triangular channels 294. A support member 298,<br>
which is best seen in Fig. 80, is positioned across the top of the reinforcement member<br>
and extends perpendicularly to the channels in the reinforcement member so as to provide<br>
rigidity to the panel in a direction transverse to that provided by the reinforcement<br>
member so that the panel is rigidified in perpendicular directions.<br>
The support member 298, which can be made of the same material as the planar<br>
sheet 288 and the reinforcement member 284 and as seen in Fig. 80, includes a<br>
downwardly opening channel-shaped body of inverted U-shaped cross-section projecting<br>
away from the reinforcement member and having outwardly directed flanges 300 from<br>
which a plurality of tabs 302 are cut and bent to extend downwardly. The cross-section<br>
of the tabs 302 is best seen in Fig. 82 to conform generally to the walls and space 296 of<br>
the trapezoidal channels in the reinforcement member so as to mechanically connect the<br>
support member to the reinforcement member. The support member can, therefore, be<br>
mounted on the reinforcement member by positioning the support member perpendicular<br>
to the trapezoidal channels and sliding the support member along the length of the<br>
channels until it is desirably positioned. A plurality of the downwardly opening support<br>
members can be positioned at any desired spacing, as illustrated in Fig. 83. The support<br>
members, accordingly, substantially rigidify the panel so that it has very little flexibility<br>
in any perpendicular direction.<br>
To the extent it is not clear from the above, the connection between the various<br>
components of the panels described can be achieved adhesively, ultrasonically, through<br>
heat fusion or any other acceptable bonding system. The connections are made where a<br>
component engages an upper or lower sheet of the panel or along peaks defined by a<br>
component of the panel.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that an improved panel for use in a drop<br>
ceiling system or in other similar uses has been provided that has variable features for<br>
adjusting the flexibility of the panel in longitudinal or transverse directions and also for<br>
varying the compressibility of the panel for shipping purposes. The exposed faces of the<br>
panels of this invention can also be modified by adding a continuous elastomeric<br>
polymer, such as a urethane or neoprene film or adhesive, as described, by way of<br>
example, with regard to the panels of Figs. 13 and 60-62 and/or a decorative film as<br>
described, by way of example, with regard to the panel of Fig. 13. Due to the flexible<br>
nature of the panels, they can also be easily inserted into the openings defined by the<br>
stringers and cross-members of a suspended support system and the panels will not break,<br>
as they are not brittle even when being flexed for insertion into the support system. With<br>
modifications to the suspension system, it will also be appreciated that the panels could<br>
be used in a wall of a building structure.<br>
