The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention, by the virtue of there chemical characteristic, could either independently or simultaneously modulate the melatonin receptor i.e. either they are melatoninergic ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists, or they interact with both 5-HT as well as melatonin receptor.<br>
Thus, compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are useful for treating<br>
diseases wherein activity of either 5-HT (Serotonin) and/or melatonin is modulated to obtain<br>
the desired effect.  Specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment<br>
and / or prophylaxis of psychosis, paraphrenia, psychotic depression, mania, schizophrenia,<br>
Schizophreniform   disorders,   anxiety,   migraine  headache,   depression,   drug  addiction,<br>
convulsive disorders, personality disorders, hypertension, autism,  post-traumatic stress<br>
syndrome,  alcoholism,  panic attacks,  obsessive-compulsive disorders,  chronobiological<br>
abnormalities, circadian rhythms, anxiolytic, osteoporosis, ischemic stroke, lower the risk of<br>
2<br><br>
SIDS in young infants with low endogenous melatonin levels, reproduction, glaucoma and sleep disorders.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic drugs.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotenergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, which originate in the central nervous system, these include diseases and conditions related to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, sdiizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotonergic Neuronal Systems, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. (1982). 221-247; Boullin D. J., Serotonin in Mental abnormalities (1978), 1, 316; Barchas J. et. al., Serotonin and Behavior (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotonergic systems. Particularly, preferred are the compounds which have receptor specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al.. The peripheral actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (1989), 246; Saxena P. R. et. al.. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990). supplement 7, 15),<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (S-They) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990). 14, 35 and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HT6 receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma etal, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-<br><br>
327 and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the S-HTe receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol., 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18, 1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that compounds that antagonize the S-HTe receptor will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system.<br>
There is very strong evidence that melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, especially those that exhibit circadian and circannual rhythm city. Great interest therefore lies in the possibility of making available to the clinician melatonin analogues that are metabolically more stable and have an agonist or antagonist character and of which the therapeutic effect may be expected to be superior to that of the hormone itself. PCT patent application gives extensive literature on studies with melatonin and potential therapeutic application of various ligands reported till date.<br>
Those various effects are exerted via the intermediary of specific melatonin receptors. Molecular biology studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of receptor sub-types that are capable of binding that hormone (Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1995, 16, p. 50; WO 97 04094). Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, white blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels (Withyachumnarnkul et al., Life Sci, 12 65, 1986). Three melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far MT-I , MT-2 and Mel 1 c (Barreft et al., Biol. Signals Recept., 1999. 8: 6-14).<br>
There is evidence suggesting both melatonin agonists and antagonists would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions.

S. patent application publication number US 2003/0105087 discuss some tricyclic indole and tricyclic azaindole derivatives having very valuable pharmacological characteristics in respect of melatoninergic receptors.<br>

prodrug from or a modified prodrug form; or any combination of 1 to 3, above.<br>
