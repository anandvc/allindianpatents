				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to signalling of available bandwidth especially in multicarrier<br>
wireless telecommunication systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A tendency of new wireless telecommunication systems is that they often require more<br>
bandwidth than existing systems, as new and more demanding services are likely to be<br>
introduced by the new systems. However, the available spectrum is limited and it is difficult to<br>
identify new spectrum for new communication systems, especially if the new spectrum shall be<br>
identical in all different regions of the world. This calls for a need of flexibility with respect to<br>
spectrum usage in the sense that pieces of radio spectrum of different size and in different<br>
frequency bands should be used with basically the same radio air interface.<br>
For the sake of example, assume that the most demanding applications require that the system<br>
bandwidth needs to be 100 MHz. International standardisation and regulatory bodies will<br>
therefore have to make sure that there will be ample spectrum available so that a number of 100<br>
MHz bands could be offered to the customers. However, it is also likely that certain regions will<br>
have smaller pieces of spectrum available here and there that are smaller than 100 MHz, say a 30<br>
MHz band in one region and a 66 MHz band in another.<br>
One possibility is to design many different air interfaces for a number of bandwidths - say 30,<br>
66 and 100 MHz - and let the base stations and mobile users choose one or several of them<br>
depending on the situation, say a 25 MHz air interface for the 30 MHz band, a 50 MHz interface<br>
for the 66 MHz band and 100 MHz interface for the 100 MHz band. This however leaves some<br>
parts of the spectrum unused: 5 MHz in the 30 MHz band and 16 MHz in the 66 MHz band,<br>
while the 100 MHz band is fully used.<br><br><br>
Even if there is a high degree of commonality between different air interfaces, the complexity of<br>
equipment with several air interfaces will be significantly larger than if only one air interface can<br>
be used instead.<br>
Another suggestion for better usage of available frequency spectrum is to let several operators<br>
share spectrum or rent or buy resources from each other.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposals and ideas referred to above suffers from a number of drawbacks. Already<br>
mentioned is that using different air interfaces in several parts of the spectrum causes greater<br>
complexity. Another is that available pieces of spectrum might be too big for certain<br>
applications, which leads to a waste of resources. Still another problem is how to inform the<br>
users of the existence and extent of free spectrum for a certain application at a certain moment in<br>
a certain location area. In other words there is a need for greater flexibility and fast allocation of<br>
resources whenever the users so request.<br>
The solution is presented in the appended claims relating to a method and means for signalling<br>
the availability of spectrum in terms of bandwidth and location.<br>
The invention is advantageously implemented in wireless multicarrier system where the total<br>
maximum bandwidth is made up of a large number of narrowband sub carriers like for example<br>
in Orthogonal Frequency Divisional Multiplexing, OFDM, Interleaved Frequency Divisional<br>
Multiplex, IFDM or similar. In OFDM and IFDM the sub carriers are ideally mutually<br>
orthogonal. Generally, very similar systems can be designed with pulse shapes that make the sub<br>
carriers slightly non-orthogonal but that have other good properties, for example better spectral<br>
properties. This difference does not have a bearing on the invention so when OFDM is<br>
mentioned in the examples below, also these other more general types of systems are applicable.<br>
The only thing that is important is that the system consists of a large number of sub carriers.<br><br><br>
With a multicarrier system it is easy to adjust the used system bandwidth by simply switching off<br>
some blocks of sub carriers. However, a problem with this solution is how to inform the mobiles<br>
about the size and location of the spectrum that is currently used by the communication system.<br>
The invention described here solves this problem by including this size and location information<br>
within the sub carriers blocks themselves.<br>
The information about which set of downlink carriers in a block that is available is sent downlink<br>
from the base station on an acquisition channel, a broadcasting channel or some other cell<br>
covering channel. At least one easily detected downlink channel must be transmitted which is<br>
within an operational band known to the mobile user and contains information about where this<br>
operational band starts and stops relative to the location of said downlink channel. It is enough if<br>
the user has a rough idea of where the operational band can be found. This kind of rough<br>
information could have been broadcasted to the user in an earlier cell search.<br>
The format of the information about the size and location of the operational band could vary.<br>
Here are some examples:<br>
•	A start and stop frequency or frequency number is given absolutely or relative to the<br>
location of the channel containing this information.<br>
•	A start frequency or frequency number is given, absolutely or relatively specified, plus a<br>
number of maximum carriers or a fraction of that number.<br>
•	An identifying number where said identifying number identifies an operational<br>
bandwidth from a list of predefined operational bandwidths.<br>
•	The information about the location in spectrum could be explicitly signalled or implicitly<br>
derived by synchronisation signals.<br><br><br>
• As soon as the mobile is informed of the available resources it may access a suitable<br>
channel representing its needs in the normal way well known to a person skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention, together with further aspects and advantages is exemplified by reference to a<br>
number of embodiments and accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig 1 shows a frequency spectrum exemplifying bands available in a typical situation.<br>
Fig 2 is an overview of the system according to the invention.<br>
Fig 3 is a flow chart showing the steps of the invention in a further embodiment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In Fig 1 a typical spectrum is shown, divided into three blocks or operational bands, I, II and III<br>
of 100 MHz, the maximal system bandwidth in this example. The spectrum is partly shared by<br>
two operators A and B. A has part I and B has part III while part II is shared between the both<br>
operators. It is assumed that, by negotiation between the operators, the border b between A and B<br>
is changed from time to time depending on the demand from the subscribers of A and B<br>
respectively. The sharing distribution could of course be different. Fig 1 is just an example.<br>
N is the number of sub carriers in each part. Lets assume that the 100 MHz band is divided into<br>
4096 sub carriers of about 25 kHz each, (i.e. JV=4096). In theory any number N could be<br>
activated making a large number of air interface bandwidths possible using just one air interface.<br>
This is a basic property of these types of systems. An operator can, at different moments, have<br>
say 1000, 2000 or 4000 carriers to its disposal, varying with the demands and behaviours of the<br>
subscribers.<br>
Assume that the mobile user knows or can guess the approximate location of all N carriers. First<br>
the mobile user must detect the presence of one or more acquisition channel(s) for cell search<br><br>
purposes. Such channels are designed so that there is a very small probability to mistake them for<br>
other types of signals, or for other types of signals to be mistaken for acquisition signals. In<br>
general the user must scan all possible locations to find this signal in order to unambiguously<br>
find one. Then the mobile knows that this channel lies within the operational bandwidth. After<br>
that, the information in this acquisition channel about the size and location of the actual carrier<br>
set is read.<br>
As an example, the acquisition channel is represented by one or more of the bold marked carriers<br>
of block I in Fig 1. Then the information on the acquisition channel tells the user that the band<br>
starts at fl and stops at f2 and that the bandwidth is f2 — fl.<br>
Alternatively, based on acquisition channel information, the mobile finds another channel that<br>
broadcasts control of the system, and reads the bandwidth information there or part could be read<br>
from an acquisition channel and part from another channel that transmits broadcast control<br>
information.<br>
The system information bold marked carriers are spread out among all possible sub bands of the<br>
operational band. Operator A 's signalling is as follows: in the three bold sub carriers to the left<br>
in block I, information says that the bandwidth is 100 MHz and all sub bands are used i.e. the<br>
whole 100 MHz band, the next three defines a bandwidth of about 70 MHz in block II. Operator<br>
B's signalling is as follows: The single bold sub carrier defines a ca 30 MHz system bandwidth<br>
in block II, and the next three in block III define a full 100 MHz bandwidth.<br>
Included in Fig 1 is a piece of unused spectrum in block II that comprises a few sub carriers that<br>
act as a guard band between the two generally unsynchronised and uncoordinated operators. This<br>
is sometimes beneficial in order to reduce the disturbances between the transmitted signals<br>
belonging to the two neighbouring sub bands<br>
If the operators, in some real time resource exchange or the like, decide that all bandwidth in the<br>
second block II should go to operator A, then operator B simply gracefully finalises or<br>
reallocates traffic from the allotted carriers in this block, signals that the resource in block II is<br><br><br>
closed for random access attempts, and stops transmitting in this band, while operator A starts to<br>
signal that the entire 100 MHz block is now available for its subscribers.<br>
Since the terminals periodically read bandwidth information from the downlink control channels,<br>
this process could be made very quickly, in the order of milliseconds. Also, the terminals have or<br>
could have a full bandwidth detector running which makes it trivial to quickly start (de-)<br>
multiplexing data (from) to the newly available sub carriers.<br>
In Fig 1 the bandwidth information is repeated in every forth carrier for illustrative purposes as<br>
mentioned above. In practice, however, the distribution is much more thinly spread out in order<br>
not to waste bandwidth. In a 4096 carrier band the information may be carried on every 128th or<br>
256th carrier occupying less than one percent of the total bandwidth.<br>
In Fig 2 an overview of the system according to the invention is shown. A traffic control centre,<br>
TCC, is connected over suitable interfaces to a number of base station transceivers BS, only one<br>
shown in the figure. The base stations have connections with several mobile stations, MSI and<br>
MS2. The TCC has an over all control of the traffic in the system and one of its tasks is to collect<br>
information about the availability of bandwidth of particular parts of radio spectrum used in the<br>
system. The information is transferred to the base stations and from there transmitted on a<br>
broadcast channel or the like to the users, MS. The TCC is connected to public networks like the<br>
Internet. The TCC may also have connections with other TCCs belonging to other operators and<br>
after negotiations taking over smaller or greater parts of spectrum from each other.<br>
A user, MSI in Fig 2 for example, entering the location area of the system scans the broadcast<br>
channel(s) sent out by the base station for information about available bandwidth and location in<br>
the spectrum according to the invention. MSI, having received the information in receiver R,<br>
stores it into a memory M. After entering the scanning is repeatedly performed for changing<br>
conditions and the memory is updated.<br>
The invention solves the problem of the need for the mobiles to have knowledge of available<br>
bandwidth. The knowledge is collected from a search of the radio environment for the available<br><br><br>
resources by detecting system information stored in certain sub carriers in the multicarrier<br>
operational bands.<br>
In Fig 3, a method for downloading information using the invention is illustrated as a number of<br>
steps. In step I, a mobile station, MS, has a need for a multicarrier band with N carriers for the<br>
downloading. The MS searches the radio interface in step II. The search is simplified by the fact<br>
that information about the size and location of available bands are stored at specified locations<br>
throughout the bands e.g. every 128th carrier. The efficiency of the search could be even more<br>
enhanced if location and size of suitable bands are prestored in the memory M of the MS. In step<br>
III, an N+8 carrier band is assigned to the MS. e is a small number or zero. MS downloads the<br>
information in step IV and thereafter the band could be freed for other users, step V.<br>
To conclude the invention has the following advantages:<br>
•	The base station uses basically the same signalling method for any operational<br>
bandwidth.<br>
•	The mobiles use basically the same detection method for any operational bandwidth.<br>
•	The mobile user can use the same detector in OFDM-like systems regardless of the<br>
bandwidth used in a specific cell at a specific time<br>
•	The mobile user can quickly detect changes in spectrum allocations.<br>
•	The invention gives regulators (national or international) flexibility to allocate different<br>
sized spectrum pieces for use with basically the same equipment.<br>
•	The invention gives operators the technical means to trade spectrum in real time.<br>
•	Furthermore, when regulatory conditions change the operational bandwidth can be<br>
changed quickly with the mobile station still being able to follow what is happening.<br><br>
