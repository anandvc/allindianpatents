				<td>COMBINATION OF A FIRST CONTAINER AND A SECOND CONTAINER<br>
TO FORM A DISPENSING UNIT<br>
The present invention relates to a combination of a first container and a second container to<br>
form a dispensing unit for liquid substances.<br>
EP 0 243 667 has disclosed a dispensir g unit with two containers which each have a reservoir<br>
for a liquid substance. On the top side, each of the containers has an opening in which a pump is<br>
positioned. The containers are connected to one another in a position next to one another by a<br>
common bridge piece. The bridge piece has two openings, in which the open end of the respective<br>
containers can be positioned and secured by means of a screw thread or a bayonet connection. In this<br>
case, the pumps are in each case clamped between the bridge piece and the top edge of the associated<br>
container. In the known dispensing unit, the pumps are actuated with the aid of a common pump-<br>
actuating head.<br>
A drawback of the known dispensing unit resides in particular in the field of the production of<br>
filled dispensing units. For example, the reservoirs in the known unit have to be secured to the bridge<br>
piece immediately after they have been filled so that the reservoirs are closed off by means of the<br>
pumps. An alternative could be for the filled reservoirs initially to be closed off by means of a<br>
temporary lid or the like, which then has to be removed again later in the production process in ordei<br>
for the reservoirs to be secured to the bridge piece. This temporary closure and reopening of a<br>
reservoir is undesirable.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a combination of containers for assembling a<br>
dispensing unit, in which the containers do not have to be coupled immediately after they have been<br>
filled (although the invention does permit this option).<br>
The object is achieved by a combination of a first container and a second container to form a<br>
dispensing unit, which first and second containers each have a reservoir for a liquid substance and a<br>
pump, which is secured to the reservoir, can be actuated by hand and has a dispensing opening and a<br>
pump-actuating button for dispensing substance from the reservoir, which combination also<br>
comprises coupling means for coupling together the first and second containers in a position next to<br>
one another, characterized in that the coupling means comprise : one or more first coupling members,<br>
which are each arranged on the first container, and one or more second coupling means, which are<br>
each arranged on the second container and which can each be directly coupled to an associated first<br>
coupling member on the first container.<br><br>
The combination of containers according to the invention permits<br>
various forms of production and/or operation by the user, partly<br>
as a function of the design of the coupling members. This is not<br>
the case with the known dispensing unit.<br>
For example, it is conceivable for the reservoirs to be filled,<br>
the pumps to be put in place and the filled containers then to<br>
be stored in the uncoupled state in order to be coupled in the<br>
desired combination at a later stage. It is also possible for<br>
the containers to be coupled immediately after they have been<br>
filled, in which case it is then possible to achieve a liquid-<br>
tight state immediately after the containers have been filled<br>
and the pump has been put in place, thus preventing spillage of<br>
liquid and/or introduction of impurities into the reservoir.<br>
Furthermore, it is conceivable for the containers to be sold in<br>
the uncoupled state, so that the user can make up the desired<br>
combination. On the other hand, it is also possible for the<br>
coupling to be produced in the factory and to be more or less<br>
permanent, so that it cannot be detached, or can only be<br>
detached with difficulty, by the user.<br>
In a version in which subsequent uncoupling of the containers is<br>
possible, there is also tie option of making up all kinds of<br>
combinations, filling empty containers and/or replacing them,<br>
etc.<br>
The pump or pumps may if appropriate be foam-forming pumps.<br>
It is preferable for the coupling means for different sizes of<br>
containers to be of uniform design, so that containers of<br>
different dimensions can be coupled to one another. The options<br>
when assembling dispensing units are then not limited by<br>
dimensions of the containers, as is the case in the prior art,<br>
in which a specific bridge piece is only suitable for a specific<br>
cross section of the connection of the reservoirs.<br><br>
It is preferable for the coupling members to be formed<br>
integrally on the relevant components of the containers, for<br>
example during the injection-moulding of suitable plastics<br>
material, and it is also preferable for the coupling members to<br>
comprise hook elements which can be coupled to complementary<br>
coupling members.<br>
In a particular embodiment:, each container is provided with a<br>
blocking element for blocking the pump-actuating button, so that<br>
the pump cannot be actuated inadvertently. This is particularly<br>
advantageous during storage of the containers, when it is<br>
possible that a force may be exerted on the actuating button of<br>
the pump. Moreover, a blocking element of this type can be used<br>
as a tamper-evident elemen;. The blocking element is preferably<br>
designed to be removable, for example by being broken off.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the dispensing unit according to<br>
the invention, the dispensing unit comprises a reservoir holder<br>
which at least partially holds the first and second reservoirs.<br>
A reservoir holder of ;his type ensures a good, stable<br>
connection between the two containers.<br>
In this case, it is advantageously possible for the reservoir<br>
holder to be made from two parts which are each suitable for<br>
holding one reservoir and can be coupled to one another. The two<br>
parts can preferably be coupled to one another by means of<br>
coupling members which can be designed in a corresponding way to<br>
the coupling members according to the invention for coupling a<br>
first container and a second container to one another.<br>
The combination of containers for assembling a dispensing unit<br>
according to the invention will be explained below with<br>
reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a container according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first container and a second container<br>
(reservoirs not shown), which are illustrated in a starting<br>
state for the two containers to be coupled to one another to<br>
form an assembly according to the invention,<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a first container and a second container<br>
(reservoirs not shown) which are illustrated during the coupling<br>
of the two containers,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a dispensing unit composed of two containers which<br>
have been coupled to one another in accordance with the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 5 shows an alternative embodiment of a combination of a<br>
first container and a second container according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 6 shows the combination shown in Figure 5 positioned in a<br>
reservoir holder, and<br>
Fig. 7 shows the coupling of the combination of a first<br>
container and a second container which is shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a container according to the<br>
invention which is denoted overall by reference numeral 1. The<br>
container 1 comprises a reservoir 2 for a liquid substance,<br>
which can be pumped out of the reservoir 2 and dispensed by-<br>
means of a pump 3 which cam be actuated by hand, for example in<br>
the form of a foam.<br>
The reservoir 2 has a base and an opening at the top side, into<br>
which the housing of the pump 3 fits.<br>
The pump 3 can be actuated using a pump-actuating button 4,<br>
which can be moved up and down, on the top side of the pump 3,<br>
during which process a liquid, for example in foam form, flows<br>
through a dispensing passage to a. dispensing opening 5 in the<br>
button 4, where it is dispensed. The dispensing passage in this<br>
case runs through the button 4.<br>
In the case of foam, the foam can be obtained as a result of a<br>
liquid being mixed with air in the reservoir.<br>
It is also possible for one of the reservoirs or both reservoirs<br>
to be of the airless typo, in which case the base of the<br>
reservoir is at least partially formed by a piston. This piston<br>
moves towards the pump as liquid is pumped out of the reservoir,<br><br>
in order to compensate fox the space which was occupied by the<br>
liquid which has been pumped out.<br>
Furthermore, the container comprises a securing collar 6, by-<br>
means of which the pump 3 is fixed to the reservoir 2. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the securing collar 6 is screwed onto the neck<br>
of the reservoir 2 and then clamps in place a flanged edge of<br>
the pump 3. A bayonet catch, snap-action connection or other<br>
embodiment is also possible, however.<br>
Two hook-shaped first coupling members 7, 8, which project on<br>
one side of the container 1, are arranged on the securing collar<br>
6 in order to couple the securing collar 6 of the container 1 to<br>
a securing collar of a second container to form a dispensing<br>
unit according to the invention. In the process, the hook-shaped<br>
coupling members 7, 8 are coupled to complementary second<br>
coupling members in the form of hook edges 17', 18' (not visible<br>
in Figure 1) on a securing collar 6' of the second container 1'.<br>
The positioning lips 9, 10 engage beneath an edge of the<br>
securing collar 6' of the second container 1'.<br>
Because coupling members 7, 8 and associated hook edges 18', 17'<br>
of the collar 6, 6' are complementary with respect to one<br>
another, the securing collcirs 6, 6' of the two containers which<br>
are to be coupled to one another can be of identical design. In<br>
this case, it is not necessary for the reservoirs to be<br>
identical. By way of example, it is possible to combine a<br>
container for a base liquid having a large reservoir with a<br>
container for a specific concentrate which is inside a smaller<br>
reservoir. On account of the fact that the coupling means are in<br>
this case releasable, it is easy for a plurality of containers<br>
holding concentrates to be interchanged.<br>
A coupling member 11, which can be coupled to a pump-actuating<br>
button 4' of the second container 1', is formed integrally on<br>
the pump-actuating button 4. For this purpose, there is a hook<br>
edge 11a on the coupling member 11.<br><br>
On the securing collar 6 there is a blocking element 12 which<br>
ensures that the pump-actuating button 4 cannot be depressed, so<br>
that the pump cannot be actuated when the blocking element 12 is<br>
present. The blocking element 12 can be broken off, so that<br>
after the blocking element 12 has been removed the pump can be<br>
activated by using the pump-actuating button 4. The blocking<br>
element 12 can also serve as a tamper-evident means indicating<br>
use of the container. After all, once the blocking element 12<br>
has been broken off, it cannot be restored to its original<br>
state.<br>
Furthermore, a coupling member 13, which during coupling of the<br>
container 1 to a second container 1' is coupled to a coupling<br>
member 13' on a blocking element 12' of the second container 1' ,<br>
is also arranged on the blocking element 12. This coupling<br>
member 13' is also of complementary design, so that the same<br>
securing collar 6 wi0th an integrally formed blocking element 12<br>
can be used for both containers 1, 1' which are to be coupled to<br>
one another.<br>
Figure 2 shows a starting position of a first container 1 and a<br>
second container 1', which is similar but not identical, which<br>
containers 1, 1' can be coupled to one another in order to form<br>
a dispensing unit. The reservoirs of the containers 1, 1' are<br>
not shown, in order to provide a clear view of the coupling<br>
between the containers.<br>
The securing collars 6, 6' of the two containers 1, 1' are in<br>
this case of identical design. This is possible because each<br>
pair of coupling members 7, 8 and 7', 8' of a collar 6 and 6',<br>
respectively, has complementary coupling members.<br>
Furthermore, the drawing clearly illustrates that the pump-<br>
actuating buttons 4, 4' of the two containers 1, 1' are designed<br>
to be substantially mirror-symmetrical. The dispensing opening 5<br>
lies close to the bearing surface of the container, so that the<br>
dispensing opening 5 lies next to a dispensing opening 5' of the<br>
second container 1' when they have been coupled to one another.<br>
The liquids which are then dispensed when the pump-actuating<br><br>
buttons 4, 4' are actuated are dispensed in the vicinity of one<br>
another, so that the liquids can easily be collected using one<br>
hand or the like.<br>
When the two containers 1, 1' are being coupled to one another,<br>
first of all the pump-actuating buttons 4 are brought into<br>
engagement with one another by means of the coupling members 11,<br>
11' , which each engage benind a downwardly projecting hook edge<br>
of the other button 4', 4 . In this position, the containers 1,<br>
1' are at an oblique angle. Then, the containers 1, 1' are<br>
pivoted towards one another (as indicated by the arrows A in<br>
Figure 2), during which movement the buttons 4, 4' which have<br>
been hooked together form a hinge, so that the other coupling<br>
members 7, 8, 7', 8', 17, 17', 18, 18' of the two containers 1,<br>
1' are coupled to one another.<br>
Figure 3 shows the containers 1, 1' just before complete<br>
coupling has been effected. In this figure too, the reservoirs<br>
are not shown. It can be seen that the hook-shaped coupling<br>
member 7' can hook behind the associated hook edge 18', and the<br>
coupling member 8 can hook behind the hook edge 17' .<br>
Furthermore, the hook-shaped coupling members 7', 8' of the<br>
second container 1' are coupled to the hook edges 18, 17 of the<br>
first container 1. It is also possible to see the stops 19, 20<br>
and 19', 20' of the collars 6 and 6', respectively, which bear<br>
against one another in the coupled state.<br>
Figure 4 shows the two containers 1, 1' from Figure 3, but now<br>
in the completely coupled state. The embodiment of the coupling<br>
means which has been described produces a strong, torsionally<br>
rigid coupling. This torsional rigidity is advantageous during<br>
the actuation of the pumps.<br>
Figure 4 clearly shows that the two blocking elements 12, 12'<br>
bear against one another. On account of the presence of these<br>
blocking elements 12, 12', the pumps 3, 3' cannot be actuated.<br>
The blocking elements 12, 12' shown in this case are coupled to<br>
one another by means of coupling members 13 as shown in Figure<br><br>
1. After the blocking members 12, 12' have been broken off, the<br>
pumps 3, 3' can be operated.<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of a combination of a<br>
first container and a second container according to the<br>
invention, the first and second containers being denoted by<br>
reference numerals 101 and 101', respectively. The containers<br>
101, 101' each comprise a reservoir 102, 102' and a pump 103,<br>
103' . Each of the pumps 103, 103' can be actuated by means of an<br>
associated pump-actuating button 104 and 104', respectively, and<br>
each pump 103, 103' is secured to the respective reservoir 102,<br>
102' by means of a securing collar 106 and 106', respectively.<br>
The reservoirs 102, 102' of the' combination of the first<br>
container 101 and second container 101' can be placed in a<br>
reservoir holder 121 which is designed to receive and hold in<br>
place virtually the whole of the two reservoirs. If appropriate,<br>
it is possible for the reservoir holder 121 to be designed in<br>
such a manner that the reservoirs are only partially<br>
accommodated in the reservoir holder.<br>
The reservoir holder 121 with a combination of a first container<br>
101 and a second container 101' positioned in it is shown in<br>
Figure 6. The securing collars 106, 106' preferably comprise an<br>
edge or the like which forms a click-fit connection with a<br>
complementary edge in the reservoir holder. The two containers<br>
remain seated securely in the reservoir holder as a result of a<br>
click-fit connection of this type or some other suitable<br>
connection.<br>
If appropriate, it is possible to produce the reservoir holder<br>
121 from two parts, in such a manner that each reservoir 102,<br>
102' can be placed in one of the parts, in which case the parts<br>
can then be coupled to cne another, optionally releasably,<br>
preferably by means of coupling members or the like. These<br>
coupling members can be designed i:a a corresponding way to the<br>
coupling members according to the invention for coupling the<br>
containers to one another.<br><br>
The coupling of the pump-actuating buttons 104, 104' of the<br>
first container 101 and the second container 101' is shown, at<br>
least in part, in Figure 7. This coupling is what is known as a<br>
sliding click-fit connection, in which the two pump-actuating<br>
buttons 104, 104' have coupling means which are complementary to<br>
one another, in such a manner that the pump-actuating buttons<br>
104, 104' can be pushed together and coupled by means of a<br>
movement in the direction of the arrow shown in Figure 7. The<br>
pump-actuating button 104 comprises a coupling member 111 which,<br>
functioning as a click-fit connection, can be coupled to a<br>
coupling member 111' of the pump-actuating button 104' of the<br>
second container 101' . Furthermore, in this case the pump-<br>
actuating button 104 comprises a projecting section which fits<br>
into a complementary recess in the second pump-actuating button<br>
104' . The projecting section is fixed in the recess by means of<br>
the click-fit connection between the first and second coupling<br>
members 111, 111'<br>
In the embodiment shown, this projecting section and	the<br>
complementary recess are located in the vicinity of	the<br>
dispensing opening of the respective pump-actuating button	104,<br>
104' and cannot be seen in the figures.<br>
As a result of the coupling described here, the two pump-<br>
actuating buttons 104, 104' which have been coupled to one<br>
another function as a common pump-actuating button for operating<br>
both pumps 103, 103' simultaneously.<br>
The containers 101, 101' shown in Figures 5 and 6 are each also<br>
provided with a cylindrical clamping element 122, 122' which is<br>
substantially U-shaped in cross section and comprises two limbs,<br>
which are positioned around a relatively narrow section of the<br>
pump-actuating button 104 and 104', respectively, and thereby<br>
prevent any possibility of the pump-actuating buttons 104, 104'<br>
being depressed. These clamping elements 101, 101' therefore<br>
function as blocking elements. If appropriate, during production<br>
of the container it is possible to produce a (plastic)<br>
connection between the clamping element 122, 122' and the<br><br>
respective container 101, 102'.. A connection of this type can<br>
then be used as a tamper-evident component.<br>
The coupling between the two containers of the embodiments of<br>
the dispensing unit according to the invention which have been<br>
described and shown may be designed to be releasable. This is<br>
advantageous if, for example, it is necessary for it to be<br>
possible to mix a base n.aterial with various concentrates, for<br>
example for different colours or the like. The container with a<br>
reservoir containing base material, which is then preferably<br>
larger, can then be combined as required with the different<br>
containers holding concentrates.<br>
It is also possible to make it difficult to uncouple the two<br>
containers from one another. It may even be the case that this<br>
uncoupling can only be achieved by using special tools.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible for the containers to be coupled to<br>
one another in other ways rather than the method described<br>
above, but the method shown here is the simplest method for the<br>
embodiment illustrated of the assembly of the two containers.<br>
It should be clear that the various containers can be coupled to<br>
one another in various ways to form an assembly according to the<br>
invention by means of coupling members which are preferably<br>
formed integrally on the containers.<br><br>
