				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of vicinal diols using the recyclable catalyst LDH-osmate. More particularly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of vicinol diol by asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) of an olefin using the recyclable catalyst LDH-osmates of the formula [M11(i.X) M111x (OH)2][OsO42' ]x/2.zH2O wherein M" is a divalent cation selected from the group consisting of Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Mi2"1", Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+; M111 is a trivalent ion selected from the group consisting of A13+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+ and Co3+, x is the mole fraction having integral value ranging from 0.2 to 0.33, and z is the number of water molecules and ranges from 1 to 4.<br>
The catalyst LDH-osmate of the formula [MII(i.X)MIIIx(OH)2][OsO42"]x/2.zH2O wherein z is the number of water molecules is prepared as described and claimed in our co-pending application no. NF 327/00.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an eco-friendly process employing recyclable LDH-osmates as heterogeneous catalysts in place of soluble osmium catalysts for preparing vicinal diols by asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins in presence of cinchona alkaloid compounds. The dihydroxylated products are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs and pharmaceuticals. For example the products of cinnamic acid esters are intermediates for taxol side chain, an anticancer drug, diltiazem, calcium antagonist and chloramphenicol, an antiboitic. Propranolol, a ft blocker can also be derived from the diol obtained through this method.<br>
There are serious disadvantages in performing the catalytic AD reaction with homogeneous system in the manufacture of vicinal diols due to presence of toxic remnants of osmium in products and high cost of osmium tetroxide or potassium osmate dihydrate. By employing the heterogeneous catalytic system, the cost naturally comes down due to easy recovery and recyclability of the catalyst for number of recycles and very insignificant loss of osmium tetroxide, when compared with homogenous system. The products thus obtained using heterogeneous catalyst system are benign in the sense that the presence of osmium in minor impurities in the dihydroxylated products is also precluded.<br>
Reference is made to US patents US 4,871,855 and 5,260,421 wherein asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins are carried by osmium tetroxide and cinchona alkaloids in homogeneous way. The inherent disadvantages in this process are'cumbersome procedure for the recovery of the osmium catalyst from the reaction mixture, generation of toxic waste and possibility of presence of toxic osmium in traces in the product.<br>
Reference is made to US patent US 5,516,929 wherein asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins are carried by osmium tetroxide and polymer-bound cinchona alkaloids in heterogeneous way. The drawbacks are difficulty in quantitative .recovery of toxic osmium catalyst, lower enantioselectivity and reduction in activity and enantioselectivity in each and every recycle experiments.<br>
Reference is made to US patent US 5,968,867 wherein asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins are carried by osmium tetroxide and silicagel supported bis-cinchona alkaloid derivatives in heterogeneous way. The drawbacks are difficulty in quantitative recovery of toxic osmium catalyst and reduction in activity and enantioselectivity in each and every recycle experiments.<br>
Reference is made to European patent EP 940,170 A2 wherein catalytic asymmetric dihydroxylation of alkenes are carried by using a polymer-supported osmium tetroxide catalyst. The drawbacks are requiring higher amount of catalyst (5 mol%), longer reaction time and use of expensive polymer as a support.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to use in catalytic amounts for preparing vicinol diols by asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins employing oxidants in presence of cinchona alkaloid compounds which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>

Still another object of the present invention is to recover the heterogeneous LDH-osmates used in asymmetric dihdroxylation by simple filtration and reuse for number of cycles with consistent activity and enantioselectivity.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is the quantity of LDH-osmate used in the reaction is 0.01 to 3 mol% of osmium with respect to the substrate.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is wherein the co-oxidant is N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO), trimethylamine N-oxide, hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydrogen peroxide, potassium ferricyanide, sodium periodate or molecular oxygen.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is the chiral ligand is monomeric or polymeric, preferably hydroquinidine 1,4-phthalazinediyl diether ((DHQD)2PHAL),<br><br>
hydroquinidine        2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl        diether        ((DHQD)2PYR),<br>

quinolyl ether (DHQD-MEQ) or the other pseudoenantiomeric forms of these<br>
ligands.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of vicinal<br>
diol using the recyclable catalyst LDH-osmate which comprises dehydroxylating the<br>
olefin by using standard method with recyclable catalyst LDH-osmate in an amount<br>
in the range of 0.01 to 3 mol% in the presence of an oxidant such as herein<br>
described in a solvent at a temperature in the range of -20 to 100°C for a period 0.5<br>
to 24 h, to obtain the pure product vicinal diol by conventional method, if desired<br>
carrying out the above reaction in presence of a cinchona alkaloid compound to<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention the quantity of LDH-osmate used in the<br>
reaction is 0.01 to 3 mol% of osmium content with respect to the substrate.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the LDH-osmate is recovered by<br>

The novelty of the present invention lies in the design and preparation of LDH-osmates through simple exchange process for the first time and uses it in catalytic amounts for preparing vicinal diols by asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins employing oxidants in presence of cinchona alkaloid compounds. Higher yields and enantioselectivities are obtained when LDH-osmate catalysts are used in the asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins in aqueous organic solvents. Since the dihydroxylated products are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals, this invention which envisages reduction of toxic osmium metal content in these products is timely and appropriate, due to use of heterogeneous catalyst. The consistent activity and enantioselectivity obtained for several cycles in asymmetric dihydroxylation makes the process economical and possible for commercial realisation. Therefore, LDH-osmates are better option for the synthesis of vicinal diols. The use of different metals and in varied compositions used in the preparation of LDH support has no impact on its final form of osmate catalysts with respect to activity and enantioselectivity. Thus this invention offers the best techno-economic route for the synthesis of vicinal diols, intermediates for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals.<br>

Asymmetric Dihydroxylation of Olefins<br>
The  asymmetric  dihydroxylation  reaction  of olefins  was  performed using the following two methods in order to evaluate LDH-osmates of the present invention. Method I<br>

Wt.) were stirred for 30 min in the mixed solvent of water/acetone/acetonitrile (in the volume ratio of 1:1:1). To this mixture was added an olefin (1.0 Eq. Wt). After the reaction, the LDH-osmate catalyst was filtered off and washed with methanol. The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure. The chiral ligand was recovered from the aqueous layer after acidification (IN HC1). The concentrated organic layer was purified to afford the corresponding cis-diol by using conventional processes. The yield and the optical purity of the product were determined. Method II<br>
LDH-osmate of the formula Ila-IId (0.002.about.0.02 Eq. Wt. of osmium content in the LDH), cinchona alkaloid (DHQD)2PHAL (0.02 Eq. Wt.),-.potassium ferricyanide (K3 Fe(CN)6, (3.0 Eq. Wt.) and potassium carbonate (K2 CO3, 3.0 Eq. Wt.) were stirred for 30 min in the mixed solvent of tert-butanol/water (in the volume ratio of 1:1). To this mixture<br>
was added an olefin (1.0 Eq. Wt). After the reaction, LDH-osmate catalyst was filtered off and washed with methanol. The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure. The chiral ligand was recovered from the aqueous layer after acidification (IN HC1). The concentrated organic layer was purified to afford the corresponding cis-diol by using conventional processes. The yield and the optical purity of the product were determined.<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	A novel and ecofriendly process for asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins is presented.<br>
2.	The present process dispenses the use of soluble, toxic osmium tetroxide or potassium<br>
osmate dihydrate instead a heterogeneous reusable LDH-osmates are used.<br>
3.	LDH-osmates are prepared and used for asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins as<br>
heterogeneous catalysts. The use of heterogeneous LDH-osmates precludes the presence<br>
of osmium in traces with product<br>
4.	The enantioselectivity and the yields are good.<br>
5.	The work-up procedure is simple.<br>
6.	The catalyst is subjected to many recycles, which displayed consistent activity.<br>
