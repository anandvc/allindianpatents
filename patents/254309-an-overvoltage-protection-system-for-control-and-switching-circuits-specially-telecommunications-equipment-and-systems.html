SURGE SUPPRESSOR<br>
The invention relates to an overvoltage protection means having a first electrode. having a<br>
second electrode, with a breakdown spark gap which is formed between the two electrodes, and<br>
with a housing which holds the electrodes, when the breakdown spark gap is ignited an arc<br>
forming between the two electrodes within a discharge space which connects the two electrodes.<br>
Electrical, but.especially electronic measurement, control and switching circuits, mainly also<br>
teleconununications equipment and systems, are sensitive to transient overvoltages, as can occur<br>
especially by atmospheric discharges, but also by switching operations or short circuits in power<br>
supply grids: This sensitivity has increased to the extent electronic components, especially<br>
transistors and thyristors. are being" used; in particular, increasingly used integrated circuits are<br>
highly endangered by transient overvoltages.<br>
Electrical circuits work with the voltage specified for them, the rated voltage (generally ~ line<br>
voltage)normally without interference. This does not apply when overvoltages occur.<br>
Overvoltages are all voltages which are above the upper tolerance limit of the rated voltage.<br>
They also include mainly transient overvoltages which can occur due to atmospheric discharges,<br>
but also due to switching operations or short circuits in power supply grids and can be<br>
metallically, inductively orcapacitively coupled into electrical circuits. Overvoltage protection<br>
means have been developed and have been known for more than 20 years to protect electrical or<br>
electronic circuits, especially electronic measurement, control and switching circuits, mainly<br>
also telecommunications equipment and systems wherever they are used against transient<br>
overvoltages wherever they are used.<br>
An important component of an overvoltage protection means of the type under consideration<br>
here is at least one spark gap which responds at a certain overvoltage, the sparko'ver voltage, and<br>
thus prevents overvoltage.  which are larger than the sparkover voltage of the spark gap from<br>
occulting in the circuit which is protected by an overvoltage protection means.<br>
It was stated at the beginning that the overvoltage protection means as claimed in the invent,on<br>
has two electrodes and one breakdown spark gap which is formed between the two electrodes. In<br><br>
practice these breakdown spark gaps are often also called air breakdown spark gaps, within the<br>
 framework of the invention a breakdown spark gap also meaning an air breakdown spark gap.<br>
But here, besides air, another gas can also be present between the electrodes. The region of the<br>
overvoltage protection means in which the arc forms when the breakdown spark gas ignites, is<br>
hereinafter called the discharge space. It is generally the space between the two electrodes.<br>
In addition to overvoltage protection means with a breakdown spark gap, there are also<br>
overvoltage protection means with a flashover spark gap in which a creeping discharge occurs<br>
when it responds<br>
Overvoltage protection means with a breakdown spark gap compared to overvoltage protection<br>
means with a flashover spark gap have the advantage of higher surge current-carrying, capacity,<br>
but the disadvantage of a higher and also not especially constant sparkover voltage. Therefore<br>
different overvoltage protection means with a breakdown spark gap have already been suggested<br>
and have been improved with respect to the sparkover voltage. Here, in the area of the electrodes<br>
or the breakdown spark gap which acts between the electrodes, ignition aids have been<br>
implemented in different ways, for example such that between the electrodes there has been at<br>
least one ignition aid which triggers a creeping discharge and Which projects at least partially<br>
into the breakdown spark gap, which is made in the manner of a crosspiece and which consists<br>
of plastic (compare for example DE 41 41 681 AI or DEM 02 615 Al).<br>
The aforementioned ighnition aids which are provided :in the known overvoltage protection<br>
means can likewise be called "passive ignition aids", therefore "passive ignition aids" because<br>
they do not respond "actively" themselves, but respond only by an overvoltage which occurs on<br>
the main electrodes.<br>
DE 198 03 636 A1 likewise discloses an overvoltage protection means having two electrodes,<br>
with a breakdown spark gap which acts between the two electrodes, and an ignition aid. In this<br>
known overvoltage protection means the ignition aid is made as an "active ignition aid" in<br>
contrast to the above described ignition aids which trigger a creeping discharge, specifically in<br>
that in addition to the two electrodes, called the main electrodes mere, there are two more<br>
ignition electrodes. These two ignition electrodes form a second breakdown spark gap which is<br><br>
used as an ignition spark gap. In this known overvoltage protection means the ignition aid<br>
includes not only the ignition spark gap, but also an ignition circuit with an ignition switching<br>
device. When there is an overvoltage on the known overvoltage protection means, the ignition<br>
circuit with the ignition  switching device provides for response of the ignition spark gap. The<br>
ignition spark gap and the two ignition electrodes are arranged with respect to the two main<br>
electrodes such that because the ignition spark gap has responded, the breakdown spark gap<br>
between the two main electrodes, called the main spark gap, responds. Response of the ignition<br>
spark gap leads to ionizat on of the air present in the breakdown spark gap so that after response<br>
of the ignition spark gap the breakdown spark gap also suddenly responds between the two main<br>
electrodes, therefore the main spark gap.<br>
In the known, above described embodiments of overvoltage protection means with ignition aids,<br>
the ignition aids lead to are improved, specifically lower and more constant sparkover voltage.<br>
In overvoltage protection means of the type under consideration - with or without using an<br>
ignition aid - when the breakdown spark gap ignites the resulting arc forms a low-impedance<br>
connection between the t.vo electrodes. First of all, the lightning-stroke current to be diverted<br>
flows intentionally by way of this low-impedance connection. But when the line voltage is<br>
present, then an unwanted, line follow current follows by way of the low-impedance connection<br>
of the overvoltage protect on means, so that an effort is made to extinguish the arc as quickly as<br>
possible alter the completed diversion process. One possibility for achieving this object is to<br>
increase the arc length and thus the arc voltage.<br>
One possibility for extinguishing an arc after a diversion process, specifically increasing the arc<br>
length and thus the.arc vcltage, is implemented in the overvoltage protection as is known from<br>
DE 44 02 615 A1. The overvoltage protection means known from DE 44 02 615 Al has two<br>
narrow electrodes which are each made angular and have an arcing horn and a connecting leg<br>
angled off from it. In addition, the arcing horns of the electrodes are provided with a hole in their<br>
areas bordering the connecting legs. The holes provided in the arcing horns of the electrodes<br>
provide for the resulting arc "being set into motion" by a thermal pressure effect at the instanl of<br>
response of the overvoltage protection element, therefore, of ignition, therefore migrating away<br><br>
from its origin. Since the urcing horns of the electrodes are arranged in a V-shape to one another,<br>
the segment to be bridged by the arc is thus enlarged when the arc migrates out, by which the arc<br>
voltage also rises. But the disadvantage here is that to achieve the desired increase of arc length<br>
the geometrical dimension of the electrodes must be correspondingly large, so that the<br>
overvoltage protection means is also tied altogether to certain geometrical constraints.<br>
Another possibility for extinguishing the arc after the diversion process consists in cooling the<br>
arc by the cooling action of insulation walls and the use of insulators which release gas. Here a<br>
strong flow of the extinguishing gas is necessary; this requires high construction effort.<br>
Moreover it is possible to increase the arc. voltage by increasing the pressure. To do this DE 196<br>
04 947 C1 proposes selecting the volume in the housing interior such that the arc causes a<br>
pressure increase to a multiple of atmospheric pressure. Here the increase in the follow current<br>
extinguishing capacity is achieved by a pressure-dependent effect on the arc field strength. So<br>
that this overvoltage prctection means works reliably, a very pressure-resistant housing is<br>
however necessary on the one hand, on the other the level of the line voltage must be known<br>
relatively exactly to be able to design the volume in the housing interior accordingly.<br>
If the arc is extinguished in overvoltage protection means of the type under consideration first<br>
of all the low-impedance connection between the two electrodes is interrupted, the space<br>
between the two electrodes, i.e. the discharge space, is however still almost completely filled<br>
with a conductive plasma The plasma which is present reduces the sparkover voltage between<br>
the two electrodes such that at the prevailing line voltage reignition of the breakdown spark gap<br>
can occur. This problem occurs especially when the overvoltage protection means has an<br>
encapsulated or half-open housing, since then cooling or volatilization of the plasma is<br>
prevented by the essentially closed housing.<br>
To prevent reignition of the overvoltage protection means, i.e. the breakdown spark gap, in he<br>
past various measures were taken to drive the ionized gas cloud away from the ignit on<br>
electrodes or to cool it. To do this, structurally complex labyrinths and cooling bodies are used.<br>
which make production of the overvoltage protection means more expensive.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to devise an overvoltage protection means of the initially described<br>
type which is distinguished by a high line follow current extinguishing capacity, but which can<br>
nevertheless be easily built.<br>
The overvoltage protection means as claimed in the invention in which this object, is achieved is<br>
characterized first of all essentially in that the discharge space is made such that it runs at least<br>
partially transversely and or opposite the direction of the electrical field of the prevailing line<br>
voltage, so that the distance to be overcome by the arc between the two electrodes has a<br>
transverse component to the electrical field E. This results in that the electrical field or electric<br>
voltage on the two electrodes can no longer continuously accelerate the free charge carriers<br>
contained in the plasma from one electrode to the other, by which' a line follow current is<br>
prevented.<br>
In the known overvoltage protection means, the conductive plasma which is present after the<br>
actual diversion process, but unwanted, or the free charge carriers contained in it are "removsd"<br>
by the plasma being driven away from the electrodes. These overvoltage protection means<br>
which are also called "blowout" spark gap arrangements first of all have the disadvantage that to<br>
"blow out" the plasma i relatively strong flow must be produced within the overvoltage<br>
protection means, for which generally gas-releasing insulation materials arc used. The hot<br>
plasma is then removed to the outside into the vicinity through blowout openings in the housing<br>
of the overvoltage protect on means. This has the disadvantage that at the installation site of the<br>
overvoltage protection means certain minimum distances to other voltage-carrying, or flammable<br>
components must be maintained; this enables use of these blowout overvoltage protection means<br>
only under certain installation conditions.<br>
In contrast, in the overvoltage protection means as claimed in the invention "blowout" of the rot<br>
plasma can be abandoned. The arrangement and geometrical configuration of the discharge<br>
space as claimed in the invention prevent the unwanted result of the presence of a plasma he<br>
formation of a line follow current after the actual diversion process, without the need to drive he<br>
plasma away from the electrodes or to cool it.<br>
Structurally the discharge space can be made such that it has at least three regions, the first<br><br>
region being connected to the first electrode, the second region being connected to the second<br>
electrode and the third region being connected on the one hand to the first region and on the<br>
other hand to the second region. The third region thus establishes the connection between the<br>
first region and the second region and thus also between the first electrode and the second<br>
electrode. The third region is made structurally such that in it the free charge carriers contained<br>
in the plasma are not accelerated from the first region to the second region or vice versa by the<br>
electric field of the prevailing line voltage, or are accelerated only slightly. For this reason the<br>
third region has at least one transverse component to the electrical field. In particular the third<br>
region can be aligned essentially perpendicularly or even partially opposite to the direction of<br>
the electric field of the prevailing line voltage,<br>
According to one advantageous, configuration of the invention, the discharge space is<br>
structurally implemented ;n that the side of the first electrode facing the second electrode and the<br>
side of the second electrode facing the first electrode are each partially covered with an<br>
insulating or high-resistance material, the region of the first electrode and of the second<br>
electrode not covered with the insulating or high-resistance material being offset to one another.<br>
The execution and the arrangement of the insulating or high-resistance material on the first and<br>
second electrodecan easily determine the shape of the discharge space. If a high-resistance but<br>
still conductive material is applied to the two electrodes, with a resistance so great that an arc<br>
cannot form on its surface due to current limitation after the actual diversion process this leads<br>
to the free charge carriers present in the discharge space between the two electrodes being<br>
separated by the electrical field of the prevailing line voltage and, depending on the polarity of<br>
the high-resistance material, being "sucked" on the first or the second electrode.<br>
The configuration of the discharge space as claimed in the invention between the two electrodes<br>
the discharge space having at least one transverse component to the electrical field, as described<br>
above prevents formation of an unwanted line follow current. But. at the same time the sparkover<br>
voltage of (he breakdown spark gap is also increased: this is generally not desirable either.<br>
Therefore, in one preferred configuration of the overvoltage protection means as claimed in the<br>
invention there is an active ignition aid for reducing the sparkover voltage. Fundamentally<br>
different active ignition aids known from the prior art can be used for this purpose. According to<br><br>
one preferred configuraion however the active ignition aid is implemented by a series<br>
connection of a voltage switching device and an ignition element being connected to the two<br>
electrodes, the sparkover voltage of the voltage switching device being below the sparkover<br>
voltage of the breakdown spark gap, and first a diversion current flowing via the ignition<br>
element when the voltage switching device responds.<br>
The voltage switching device is chosen such that at the sparkover voltage of the overvoltage<br>
protection means it becomes conductive, therefore "switches". As the voltage switching device<br>
there can be a varistor, suppressor diode or a gas-filled voltage arrester. The ignition element<br>
consists preferably of a conductive plastic, a metal material or a conductive ceramic and is in<br>
mechanical contact with tie second electrode.<br>
If an overvoltage occurs in the overvoltage protection means with the above described active<br>
ignition aid which is greater than or equal to the sparkover voltage dictated by the voltage<br>
switching device, the voltage switching device responds so that a diversion current begins to<br>
flow over the series connection of the first electrode  voltage switching device - ignition<br>
element  second electrode. By the initial ignition tire current produces a conductive plasma<br>
which can be introduced into the discharge space, by which the breakdown spark gap between<br>
the first electrode and the second electrode ignites and thus an arc is formed in die discharge<br>
space. With respect to other details of such an active ignition aid which can also be called<br>
"current ignition", reference is made to DE 101 46 728 A1.<br>
In particular there is a plurality of possibilities for embodying and developing the overvoltage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention. Reference is made on the one hand to the claims<br>
subordinate to claim 1,on the other hand to the following description of preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic of a first, exemplary embodiment of the overvoltage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic of a second exemplary embodiment of the overvoltage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic of another exemplary embodiment of the overvoltage<br><br>
protection means as claimed in the invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic of a. fourth exemplary embodiment of the overvoliage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows i schematic of another exemplary embodiment of the overvoltage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention and<br>
Figure 6 shows a schematic of a last exemplary embodiment of the overvoliage<br>
protection means as claimed in the invention.<br>
Different embodiments of an overvoltage protection means as claimed in the invention are<br>
shown in the figures. The overvoltage protection means which is shown only with respect to its<br>
fundamental structure includes a first electrode 1, a second electrode 2 and a housing 3 which<br>
holds the electrodes 1,2. between the two electrodes 1 and 2 there is a breakdown spark gap, an<br>
arc 4 forming between the two electrodes 1,2 when the breakdown spark g;ap is ignited.<br>
As claimed in the invention, between the two electrodes 1 and 2 there is a discharge space 5, the<br>
discharge space 5 running at least partially obliquely (Figure 2), partially transversely (Figure 1,<br>
5 and 6), partially opposite (Figure 3) or partially transversely and opposite (Figure 4) to the<br>
direction of the electrica field of the prevailing line current shown by the arrows 6. In all<br>
exemplary embodiments the discharge space 5 has at least one transverse component to the<br>
electrical field. In contrast to known overvoltage protection means, thus not the entire space<br>
between the electrodes 1,2 acts as a discharge space 5.<br>
As the Figures show, the discharge space 5 can be divided into three regions 7, 8,and 9. he<br>
first region 7 is connected to the first electrode I, the second region 8 is connected to the second<br>
electrode 2 and the first region 7 is connected to the second region 8 via the third region 9. In the<br>
embodiments shown in the Figures, the first region 7 and the second region 8 run essentially<br>
parallel to the direction of the electrical field. Conversely, the third region 9 in the exemplary<br>
embodiment as shown in Figures 1. 5 and 6 runs essentially perpendicularly or transversely to<br>
the direction of the electrical field. In the embodiment as shown in Figure 2, the third region 9 of<br>
the discharge space 5 runs obliquely and in the embodiment as shown in Figure 3 obliquely<br>
opposite the direction of the electrical field, i.e. the lengthwise direction of the third region 9 of<br><br>
the discharge space 5 has one transverse component to the direction of the electrical field. In the<br>
overvoltage protection, means as claimed in the invention as shown in Figure 4,the third region<br>
9 of the discharge space 5 has both regions which run perpendicular to the direction of the<br>
electrical field and also a region which runs opposite to the direction of the electrical field.<br>
The alignment of the third region 9 of the discharge space 5 obliquely, transversely or opposite<br>
to the direction of the electrical field of the prevailing line voltage results in that the free<br>
discharge carriers contained in the plasma are no longer continuously accelerated from the first<br>
electrode 1 to the second electrode 2 or vice versa, preventing the formation of a line folow<br>
current.<br>
To implement the discharge space 5. on the side 10 of (he first electrode 1 facing the second<br>
electrode 2 there is an insulating or high resistance material 12, and an insulating or high-<br>
resistance material 13 is applied to the side 11 of the second electrode 2 facing the first electrode<br>
1. As the figures show, the insulating or high-resistance material 12 and 13 is not applied to the<br>
entire surface of the first electrode 1 and the second electrode 2, but the region 14 and 15 on the<br>
first electrode 1 and the second electrode 2 respectively is omitted and is not covered with the<br>
insulating or high-resistar material 12 and 13. Here, as is directly apparent from the figures,<br>
the two regions 14 and 15 of the first electrode 1 and the second electrode 2 respectively not<br>
covered with the insulating or high resistance material 12 and 13 are arranged offset to one<br>
another.<br>
Comparison of the exemplary embodiments of the overvoltage protection means as claimed in<br>
the invention shown in Fi|iures 1. 2 and 3 indicates that the shape of the discharge space 5 can be<br>
easily fixed by a corresponding choice of the dimensions of the material 12, 13. If the material<br>
12, 13 has a constant thickness over its length, as is the case in the embodiment as shown in<br>
Figure 1, this leads to a region 9 of the discharge space 5 which runs transversely or<br>
perpendicularly to the direction of the electrical field. If the thickness of the material 12. 13<br>
changes over its length (Figures 2 and 3). this leads to a discharge space 5 which runs obliquely<br>
(Figure 2) or partially opposite (Figure 3) to the direction of the electrical field.<br>
As is apparent from the embodiment as shown in Figure 4. almost any shape of the discharge<br><br>
space 9 can be implemented by a corresponding configuration and arrangement of the materials<br>
12, 13 on the electrodes 1, 2. The shape of the discharge space 5 which is optimum for the<br>
respective application depends on the one hand on the required line follow current extinction<br>
capacity, on the other tend on the level of the desired sparkover voltage of the overvoltage<br>
protection means But the latter can also be determined by the fact that there is a suitable ignition<br>
aid. especially an active ignition aid.<br>
The overvoltage protection means as shown in Figures 1 and 5 differ from one another in that in<br>
the overvoltage protection means as shown in Figure I art insulating material 12, 13 is applied to<br>
the electrodes 1, 2, while for the overvoltage protection means as shown in Figure 5 a high-<br>
resistance but still conductive material 12, 13 is used The arrangement of a high-resistance but<br>
still conductive material 12, 13 directly on one side 10 of the first electrode 1 and one side 1 of<br>
the second electrode 2 leads to the free charge carriers present in the discharge Space 5 after the<br>
actual diversion process being separated by the prevailing line voltage and depending on polarity-<br>
being "sucked" from the material 12 or material 13: By reducing the number of free charge<br>
carriers in the discharge space 5 the impedance of the discharge space 5 is increased, by which at<br>
 the prevailing line voltage the occurrence of a line follow current is also prevented. Instead of<br>
mechanical "blowout" of the plasma or free charge carriers known in the prior art, electrical<br>
"suction" of the free charge carriers takes place here, by which however likewise the unwanted<br>
line follow current  is prevented and at the same time the disadvantages of the known "blowout"<br>
are prevented.<br>
Figure 6 shows another version of overvoltage protection means. In this exemplary' embodiment,<br>
comparably to the version as shown in Figure l, first of all an insulating material 12, 18 is<br>
applied to the electrodes 1, 2. The discharge space 5 however is determined not only by the<br>
shape of the insulating material 12, 13, but mainly by high-resistance material 17, 18 applied<br>
additionally to the insulating material 12. 13. comparably to the version as shown in Figure 5.<br>
The high-resistance material 17 spaced away from the region 14 is electrically conductively<br>
connected to the first electrode 1 and the high-resistance material 18 spaced away from the<br>
region 15 is electrically conductively connected to the second electrode 2. The two regions 19,<br>
20 in which the first electrode 1 is connected to the high-resistance material 17 and the second<br><br>
electrode 2 is connected to the high-resistance material 18 are likewise arranged offset to one<br>
another. The high resistance material 17, 18 first of all results in that after breakdown the free<br>
charge carriers located in the discharge space 5 are "sucked out", in doing so a current flows<br>
through the high-resistance material 17. 18; this .leads to a voltage drop along the high-resistance<br>
material 17, 18. Due to this voltage drop along the high-resistance material 17. 18 an electrical<br>
field forms with field lines 6 having one component opposite the direction of the arc 4. Thus a<br>
distortion of the electrical field in the discharge space 5 occurs, by which the "transverse nature"<br>
of the discharge space 5 is intensified. This intensification of the "transverse nature" however<br>
takes place here, in ccntrast to the embodiment as shown in Figure 3, not. geometrically, but<br>
electrically.<br>
Finally, it can be recognized from the figures that the housing 3 which is preferably made as a<br>
metal pressure housing has an inner insulation, housing 16, for the embodiments as shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 4 the-insulating material 12, 13 being connected to the insulating housing 16 or to<br>
parts of the insulating housing 16.<br><br>
