				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS  CONTAINING  RICINOLEIC ACID AND<br>
THEIR USE IN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANALGESIC THERAPY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention refers to pharmaceutical compositions containing as active<br>
principle ricinoleic acid and to their use for the treatment of pain caused by<br>
inflammations and allergies.<br>
State of the art<br>
Tachykinines (Substance P and neurokinin A) which are locally released by<br>
peripheral nerve ending of the primary afferent fibres of type C play an important<br>
role in many inflammatory and allergic pathologies. Moreover, this group of<br>
sensory nerves carries nociceptive information from the peripheral to the central<br>
nervous system. From the pharmacological point of view these nerves are<br>
characterised by their specific sensibility to capsaicins and represent the main<br>
determinants of pathologies characterised by neurogenic inflammation.<br>
Capsaicine has been used for more than twenty years both for studying pain<br>
neurophysiolgy and in the therapy of some neuropathies and skin affections,<br>
it is accepted that capsaicine acts on a sub-group of primary afferent nerves<br>
(mainly type C fibres) binding to a receptor of the nervous ending and causing the<br>
release of tachykinines. It is also accepted that its pharmacological effect takes<br>
place in to phases, first exciting and thereafter desensitising the nerve to the<br>
nociceptive stimulation. At the skin level the excitation gives a strong burning and<br>
tingling feeling in the derma area where the capsaicine is applied. The<br>
desensitising corresponds to a depletion phase of tachykinins and concurrent<br>
inhibition of the afferent sensory function of such nervous fibres.<br>
If it is true that capsaicine is useful in the treatment of pain neurological disorders<br>
and other disorders having inflammatory cause on the other hand its use is<br>
strongly limited by its side effects. These side effects are mainly tingling and<br>
burning, these sensations can be rather strong, following the topical application on<br>
the skin or mucous membranes or injection in tissues like the derma,<br>
cerebrospinal canal or blood vessels.<br>
The efforts aimed to eliminate or reduce the side effects of capsaicine or its<br>
analogues gave very poor results. For example, resiniferatoxin, was described as<br><br>
a very potent analogue having a lower irritating effect, but since this product is an<br>
ester of phorbole it could have carcinogenic properties.<br>
Moreover pharmaceutical compositions containing capsaicine in combination with<br>
anaesthetics could not reduce satisfactorily the burning sensation.<br>
Therefore it is still necessary to find a product capable of desensitising primary<br>
afferent nerves without producing the irritant or painful side effects. Such product<br>
would   have   interesting   application   in   therapy   for   many   neurological   and<br>
Inflammatory disorders characterised by a nervous inflammatory component or by<br>
an exaggerated stimulation of the capsaicine-sensible nervous fibres.<br>
It is also known that ricinoleic acid [R-(Z)-12-hydroxy-9-octadecanoic acid or d-12-<br>
hydroxyoleic acid (see formula (I)] is the main component of castor oil (it contains<br>
about 87% of ricinoleic acid), known for its lassative properties.<br>
The analgesic properties as the inhibition of neurogenic inflammation of ricinoleic<br>
oil, which are at the basis of the present invention were never described before<br>
nor could be inferred on the basis of its properties already reported in literature, for<br>
example: inhibition of phospholypase A2, (WO 91/03512), direct cell damage<br>
(Gaginella et al. Gastrenterology, 1977, 73. 95-101), inhibition of leukotriene B4°<br>
(Vasange-Tuominen et al.  Prostaglandins.  Leukotrienes  Essent.  Fatty Acids.<br>
1994, 50(5), 279-84), alteration of mucosae membrane permeability (Gaginella et<br>
al. Gastroenterology, 1977, 73, 95-101), stimulation of the adenyl cyclase-cyclic<br>
AMP system (Racusen and Binder, I. Clin. Invest., 1979, 63, 743-9) or release of<br>
prostaglandins (Beiblerand Juan, J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1979, 63, 681-5).<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention allows to overcome the above said problems thanks to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing as active principle ricinoleic acid having<br>
anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.<br><br>
In fact, it was surprisingly found that ricinoleic acid possess the necessary<br>
characteristic to overcome the previously described problems.<br>
Ricinoleic acid is easily available on the market as solution of 80% - 99% purity. It<br>
can be used as such or mixed up with the suitable pharmaceutical carriers in order<br>
to be administered in composition containing it in a quantity comprised between<br>
0.01 and 100% by weight.<br>
The present invention comprises also the pharmaceutical composition containing<br>
castor oil, as a source of ricinoleic acid, and their use for the above mentioned<br>
pathologies.<br>
The anti-inflammatory/analgesic composition can be administered orally, topically<br>
(transdermal or trans-mucosal), intranasal, epidural, intrarectal, parenteral or<br>
intravenously to human or animal patients.<br>
The present invention refers to pharmaceutical composition for use as anti-<br>
inflammatory or analgesic containing ricinoleic acid as. active principle eventually<br>
in combination with the suitable carriers and/or excipient.<br>
By administering the composition, for example topically on the inflamed area, it is<br>
possible to hale more efficiently the inflammation disorders.<br>
The present invention is useful for the treatment of various kind of painful<br>
inflammation disorders as for example: neuralgia, rheumatoid and painful arthritis,<br>
bursitis, myositis, eczema, psoriasis, sprains, allergic and vasomotor rhinitis,<br>
postherpetic neuralgia, trifacial neuralgia, muscular dilaceration, hematoma,<br>
bruise, carpal tunnel syndrome, enteral inflammation , colon irritability syndrome,<br>
haemorrhoids, ulcerative rectocolitis, blepharitis, diabetic neuropathy, cluster<br>
headache, pain therapy post-mastectomy, acne, conjunctivits, urticaria, itching,<br>
orofacial pain, detrusor hyperreftexia, uracratia, asthma and al pathologies<br>
characterised by neurogena inflammation and stimulation of the capsaicin-<br>
sensible sensor nerves.<br>
Ricinoleic acid as normally used in the present invention has purity comprised<br>
between 99%-80%, for example 87%, preferably ricinoleic acid having purity<br>
higher than 97% is used.<br>
As already said also castor oil can be used wherein the ricinoleic acid is present in<br>
a concentration comprised between 80-90%, preferably 87% and wherein also<br><br>
oleic, linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids are present.<br>
The treatment with the composition according to the invention can consist in a<br>
single application per day or can be repeated during the day. The treatment can<br>
be repeated for 10-15 days without interruption.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention do not involve any irritation<br>
on the. skin or the mucosae, contrary to what happens when capsaicins or its °<br>
analogues are applied. Moreover they do not present the other side effects which<br>
are often associated to the administration of the well known non-steroidal anti-<br>
Inflammatory agents having similar therapeutic effects, such as: somnolence,<br>
confusion, gastric disorders, gastric bleeding, and kidneys disorders.<br>
The present invention refers obviously also to pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising other products as geliflers and fillers, flavouring agents and various<br>
excipients for oral, topical, parenteral, intravenous, intranasal and intrarectal<br>
application as it is known to the men skilled in the art.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention may include also other products<br>
having antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal and antiviral action.<br>
Accordingly to the above said, it is an object of the present invention to make<br>
available a composition and a method for the treatment of inflammatory and<br>
painful disorder by oral, topical (transdermal/transmucosal), intranasal, intrarectal,<br>
parenteral or intravenous application.<br>
It is another object of the present application to make available a composition and<br>
a method for the treatment of inflammatory pathologies which is safe and effective<br>
without presenting the side effects of capsaicine and its analogues or of the<br>
conventional therapy using non steroidal anti-inflammatories.<br>
Hereinafter some examples of pharmaceutical compositions according to the<br>
Invention are reported:<br><br><br><br>
6<br>
Example 5<br>
Tablet for oral administration:<br>
Ricinoleic acid	500 mg<br>
Avocel	400 mg<br>
Colloidal Silica	200 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	10mg<br>
Example 6<br>
Emulsion for injections:<br>
Ricinoleic acid	10   g<br>
Soya phospholipides	1.2 g<br>
Sorbitoie	5   g<br>
Water for injection   q.b. to        100    ml.<br>
The pharmacological activity of ricinoleic acid as analgesic and antiinflammatory,<br>
and the absence of irritation after administration can be illustrated by the following<br>
tests.<br>
Antiinflammatory effect of ricinoleic acid in carraaeen-edema induced in guinea<br>
pig evelid.<br>
Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (weight 250-350 g) were treated. Ricinoleic acid at<br>
concentration of 30 mM was applied topically on the right eyelid 30 minutes before<br>
inducing the oedema by intradermal injection of 300 micrograms of carrageen in<br>
0.1 ml of PBS. Thereafter the animals were treated topically with 30 mM ricinoleic'<br>
acid once a day for the following 6 days. The control were treated topically with<br>
tha ricinoleic acid carrier (peanuts oil). The eight day the animals ware again<br>
treated topically with the carrier or the ricinoleic acid 30 minutes before a new<br>
induction of the oedema  in the right eyelid  by an  intradermic injection  of<br>
carrageen. The oedema entity was quantified measuring, by an ophthalmic<br>
calibre, the eyelid thickness (mm) before and 3 hours after the carrageen injection.<br>
In the same animals the carrageen oedema was repeated after 7 and 21 days<br>
after the interruption of the treatment with ricinoleic acid. Table 1 reports the<br>
oedema values measured 3 hours after the injection in the last day of the<br>
treatment and after 7 and 21 days. The reported values refer to 6 animal per<br>
group, at least.<br><br><br>
Ricinoleic acid, after 8 days of treatment, produced a marked and persistent<br>
antiinflammatory effect. The effect persisted for at least 3 weeks after the<br>
treatment.<br>
Absence of irritation of ricinoleic acid on the guinea pig conjunctiva.<br>
Ricinoleic acid (0.1-10 mg/ml, 10 microliters on the right conjunctiva) was tested<br>
for its irritant effect after direct application on the conjunctiva of non anhaestetized<br>
guinea pigs. Capsaicine (0.10-1 mg/ml) was used as control. The animals were<br>
observed and the number of cleansing movements of the eyelid were numbered in<br>
the 5 minutes following the application. At least five animals per group were<br>
tested.<br><br>
The data show that ricinoleic acid up to the highest concentration used has a<br>
minimal irritating effect on the non anaesthetised guinea pigs conjunctiva, being at<br>
least 100 fold less irritating than capsaicine<br><br>
Analgesic effect of ricinoleic acid<br>
The right eye conjunctiva of guinea pigs is treated topically twice a day with 10<br>
microliters of solutions containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/ml of ricinoleic acid. At the<br>
eight day 10 microliters of a solution containing 1 mg/ml of capsaicine is applied<br>
to the right eye conjunctiva and the cleansing movements were numbered during<br>
the first 5 minutes following the application. The data reported in the following<br>
Table refers to six animals for each group.<br><br>
Eight days treatment with ricinoleic acid produced a dose-dependent analgesic<br>
effect reducing the effect induced by capsaicine.<br><br>
