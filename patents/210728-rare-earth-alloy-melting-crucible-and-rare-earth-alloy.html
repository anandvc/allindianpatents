RARE EARTH ALLOY-MELTING CRUCIBLE. AND RARE EARTH.ALLOY.<br>
SHIN-ETSU CHEMICAL CO.,  LTD.  of 6-1,  OTEMACHI 2-CHOME, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100-0004, JAPAN JAPANESE Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
276/MUMNP/2004<br>
12/5/2004<br><br>
22-3-2006<br><br>
This invention relates to a crucible for use in the<br>
high-frequency melting of rare earth alloys  and rare earth<br>
alloys obtained using the crucible.	<br>
10<br>
BACKGROUND ART. Rare earth alloys are recently used in a variety of fields as magnet material, battery electrode material and the like.  It is important to manufacture rare earth alloys<br>
15  of consistent' quality at a low cost.<br>
In general, the rare earth alloys are produced by weighing amounts of raw materials so as to give a desired composition, placing them in a crucible, high-frequency melting, and feeding the melt into a mold or rotating rolls<br>
20  for casting. <br>
The crucible used for high-frequency melting can be manufactured by a conventional process, as used in the ceramic preparation, involving mixing predetermined raw materials with water or a binder and water to of orm a slurry,<br>
25  and shaping the slurry, followed by removal from the mold and firing (or drying).  Since the molten rare earth alloy is extraordinarily reactive, the crucible used for melting of the crucible material must meet the following requirements<br>
30        Namely, the crucible material must have, (1) least<br>
reactivity with water and (2) a certain degree of stability. On the other hand, the crucible is given requirements Including (1) resistance to cracking by thermal- expansion upon high-frequency heating (resistance to thermal shocks),<br>
35  (2) high mechanical strength, (3) easy removal of the slag which deposits within the crucible at the end of melting,<br><br>
and<br><br>
(4) low cost<br><br><br><br><br>
To meet, these requirements, the crucible.s used in the<br>
melting of rare  earth alloys have been constructed of AI2O3,<br>
or A1203 with additives.	<br>
Al203 used herein has a  stability which  is  relativoly<br>
5  high among oxides, but inferior to rare earth metals,<br>
allowing reaction to proceed little by little.. The reacted<br>
portion becomes a slag. The slag, which is strongly bound<br>
to the crucible and difficult to remove, gives rise to some'<br>
problems that the slag removal operation takes a long time<br>
10  to detract from productivity and that the crucible can be<br>
damaged during the slag removal operation.<br>
These problems may be solved by using rare earth<br>
oxides and calcium oxide which are highly stable and least<br>
reactive with rare earth metals. Because of. their<br>
15  likelihood to form hydroxides,, they can be used as unshaped<br>
refractory or added only in small amounts, but are difficult<br>
to use as the primary material of shaped refractory to<br>
construct the crucible.<br><br>
20	   DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the invention ;is to provide a rare earth alloy melting crucible which allows any slag generating thereon to be readily removed, can. be used repeatedly, and is inexpensive; and a rare earth alloy<br>
25  obtained using the crucible.<br>
Analyzing the reaction of a conventional crucible made of A1203 with an Nd-Fe-B base alloy typical of rare earth alloys and a slag thereof, the inventors found the following problems.<br>
30        More particularly, since the particle size formulation of the crucible is important in order that the. crucible be unsusceptible to cracking by thermal expansipn upon high-frequency heating (or be improved in strength to thermal shocks), the particle size distribution is adjusted<br>
35  in accordance with the purpose or the size of .the crucible. Al2OJ particles having a particle size of up to., 2 mm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

10  the rare earth oxide is distributed at a higher proportion in a portion of fine particles having a particle size  of up to 0. !3 nun than in a portion of coarse particlose having particle size in excess of 0.5 nun, and the crucible in substantially free of the reaction product of the rare eartli<br>

10	BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A rare earth alloy melting crucible according to a first embodiment of the invention is one comprising A1203 and one or more oxides selected from rare earth oxides inclusive of Y203 as main components, characterized in that the<br>
15  crucible is obtained by firing at 500 to 1,800°C, the rare earth oxide is distributed at a higher proportion in a portion of fine particles having a. particle size of up to 0.5s mm than in a portion of coarse particles having a particle size in excess of 0.5 mm, and the crucible is<br>
20  substantially free of the reaction product of the rare earth oxide with A1203.<br>
The rare earth oxide which may be used is one or more oxides selected from oxides of rare earth elements including yttrium (Y) and ranging from La to Lu. Of these, Y203, Ce02,<br>
25  Dy203, Tb407 and Sm203 having a lower degree of  hydroxide formation are preferred for use.   <br>
The rare earth oxide is distributed in ,the fine particle portion with a particle size of up to 0.5 mm in a high proportion in order to restrain reaction of the<br>
30  cifucible with a rare earth alloy.  Specifically, it is<br>
preferred.that at least 50% by volume, especially at least 60% by volume of the rare earth oxides in  the entire crucible be present in the fine particle portion.<br>
Also preferably, the content of rare earth oxide in<br>
35  the fine particle portion is 2 to 100% by volume, and<br>
especially 10 to 100% by volume.	<br><br><br>
In this portion, the balance may be one of ceramics such as A1203, Si02, T102. Zr02, MgO, CaO, Sl^N,,. DN and T103 or a combination thereof.<br>
On the other hand, since the coarse particle portion 5  having a particle size in excess of .0.5 mm is relatively less reactive, it is possible to use A1203 having a good balance of mechanical strength, stability and cost. The content of A1203 is 20 to 100% by volume, and especially 50 to 100% by volume of the coarse particle portion.<br>
10        In this portion, the balance may be one of rare earth oxides such as Y203, Ce02, Dy203, Tb407 and Srn203 and ceramics such as Si02, Ti02, ZrOz, MgO, CaO, Si3N„, BN and TiB2, or a combination thereof.  The addition amount thereof is preferably 50% by volume or less. When the rare earth oxide<br>
15 is used in the coarse particle portion, it must be included such that it is richer in the fine particle portion than in the coarse particle portion.<br>
i  It is noted that the size of coarse particles is preferably up to 10 mm, and especially up to:5 mm.<br>
20        A rare earth alloy melting crucible according to a<br>
second embodiment of the invention is one qomprising Al2T:LOs and at least one selected from rare earth oxides inclusive of Y203 as main components, characterized in, .that the crucible is obtained by firing at 1,000 to 1,700°C, the rare<br>
25  earth oxide is distributed at a higher proportion in a<br>
portion of fine particles having a particle.size of up to 0.5 mm than in a portion of coarse particles having a particle size in. excess of 0.5 mm, and the crucible is substantially free of the reaction product of the rare earth<br>
30  oxide with Al2Ti05; and<br>
a rare, earth alloy melting crucible ..according to a third embodiment of the invention is one comprising A1203, Al2Tid5 and at least one selected from rare,-earth oxides inclusive of.'Y203 as main components, characterized in that<br>
35 the crucible, is obtained by firing at l,00q,,,to 1,700°C, the rare earth oxide is distributed at a higher,proportion in a portion of fine particles having a parhH cle,size of up to<br><br>
0.5 mm than in a portion of coarse particles-having a particle size in excess of 0.5 nun, and the crucible is substantially.free of the reaction products of the rare earth oxide with A1203 and Al2Ti05. 5        The rare earth oxide which may be used is one or more oxides selected from oxides of rare earth elements including yttrium (Y) and ranging from La to Lu, as in the first embodiment. Of these, Y203, Ce02, Dy203, Tb407 and Srn203 having a lower degree of hydroxide formation are preferred for use.<br>
10  Inter alia, Y203 having excellent stability is most preferred for use.     ,<br>
The rare earth oxide is distributed in the fine particle portion with a particle size of up to 0.5 nun in a high proportion in order to restrain reaction of the<br>
15  crucible with a rare earth alloy.  Specifically, it is<br>
preferred that at least 50% by volume, especially at least 60% by volume of the rare earth oxides in the entire crucible be present in the fine particle por.tl.on.<br>
Also preferably, the content of rare earth oxide in<br>
20  the fine particle portion is 2 to 100% by volume, and especially 10 to 100% by volume.<br>
In this portion, the balance is preferably Al2Ti05, although it is. acceptable from the standpoints, of mechanical strength and the like to add one of ceramics such as AlzOJ32,<br>
25  Si02, Ti02, Zr02, MgO, CaO, Si3N„, BN and TiB2 or a<br>
combination thereof in an amount of up to 50% by volume.<br>
On the other hand, Al2TiOs becomes the main component<br>
of the coarse particle portion having a particle size in<br>
excess of 0.5 mm, and preferably up to 5 mm.  ;!.<br>
0,        Herein, part of Al2Ti05 may be replacedi by, A1203 which<br>
is commonly used as the raw material of the crucible,<br>
although a mixture with a higher proportion of Al2Ti05 is<br>
preferred as long as mechanical strength is ensured for the<br>
crucible.	<br>
5        When part of Al2Ti05 is replaced by A1?03^ the<br>
replacement proportion is preferably up to 8,0,%, by volume and<br>
especially up to 30% by volume.	<br><br>
It is noted that to the coarse particle portion, one or a mixture of the above-mentioned tare earth oxide::; and ceramics such as Si02, Ti02, Zr02., MgO, CaO, Si3N, BN and TiB2, may be added in a proportion of up to 50% by volume: 5  When the rare earth oxide is used in the coarse particle portion, it, must be included such that it is- richer in the fine particle portion than in the coarse particle portion, as previously described.<br>
In the practice of the invention, the mixing<br>
10  proportion of fine particles and coarse particles va:ries<br>
with the size of the crucible or the like, and is preferably such that the fine particle portion is 10 to 60% by volume, and especially 20 to 40% by volume.  If the fine particle portion is less than 10% by volume, strength lowers with a<br>
15  high probability.  If the fine particle portion is more than 60% by volume, a possibility of failure by thermal shocks-increases .<br>
   The crucible of the invention is produced, for example, by the following procedure.<br>
20        Rare earth oxide and A1?03 and/or Al2Ti05 are placed on a sieve having openings of a predetermined diameter (e.g., 5 mm or 0.5 mm), and classified into a fine-particle portion having a particle size of up to 0.5 mm and a coarse particle portion (e.g., with a particle size of 0.5, ,to 5 mm).  The<br>
25  rare earth oxide is used for the fine particle portion, and Al2O3 ond/or Al2O3 is used for the coarse particle problem<br>
The fine particle portion and the coarse particle portion are,mixed so that the fine particle portion accounts for 10' to 60% by volume. A slurry of the mixture is filled<br>
30  in a predetermined mold where it is fired in an air<br>
atmosphere, vacuum atmosphere or inert gas atmosphere of Ar or the like, at 500 to 1,800°C, preferably 1,000 to 1,7 00°C, obtaining a crucible.<br>
If firing is effected at temperatures higher than<br>
35 1,800°C, reaction can occur between the rare earth oxide and A1203 and/or-. Al2Ti05, and some areas are densified at the same time, with an increased possibility of becoming brittle to<br><br><br><br>
placing the blend in the inventive crucible, effecting high- frequency inciting In an Inort gas  atmosphere such as  A1 at 500 to 1,800°C, preferably 1.000 to l,700C, and pouring the resulting melt into a mold, followed by cooling. 5        It .is noted that the temperature used in high-frequency melting is preferably controlled within the above range in order to prevent any reaction with the rare earth oxide, Al2Ti05 and other components of   the crucible.<br>
10	EXAMPLE      <br>
Examples and Comparative Examples are given below by<br>
way of illustration although the invention is not limited to<br>
these Examples.	<br>
Ce02 and A1203 were passed through two sieves of 5 mm and 0.5 mm and classified into a fine particle portion having a particle size of up to 0.5 rnm and a coarse particle portion having a particle size of 0.5 to 5 mm  CeO2, was<br>
20  assigned to the fine particle portion., and QAl2O3 was assigned to the coarse particle portion.     <br>
They w.ere mixed in a proportion of 3,0;% by volume the fine particle portion and 70% by volume the coarse particle portion. A flurry of the mixture was: prepared and poured in<br>
25  a gypsum mold where it was allowed to stand over 2 days.  By subsequent removal from the mold, holding for a further 2 days and firing 1,550°C, a crucible was obtained. The crucible had an outer diameter of 540 mm, a height of 840 mm, a thickness of 40 mm and a. weight of 229 kg.<br>
3p        In this crucible was placed 500 kg of a raw material for Nd-Fe-B base magnet which had been weighed so as to give the compositional formula: 30 . 5Nd-l. 2Dy-l. 0B'-2'. OCo-O . 2A1-65.1Fe (in %.by weight). After melting in 'an Ar atmosphere by high-frequency heating at 1,500°C for 70 minutes, the<br>
35  melt was cast into a mold.<br>
The crpcible was allowed to stand for 8Q minutes for cooling and then opened to air, followed by.^slag removal<br><br>
operation.  Theareafter, the raw material  was placed there in and melted again.  In this way, the process- was repeated until the crucible became unusable.  The crucible failed during the slag removal operation at the end of 50th melting<br><br>
5  cycle.  The products of these 58 cycles were in an average<br>
yield of 98.7%, and the average time taken- for slag removal<br>

A crucible was prepared as in Example 7 except that a mixture consisting of 30% by volume of Y20:,, 30% by volume of Al2Ti05, 10% by volume of A1203 and 30% by volume of Si02 was prepared and used for the fine particle portion with a<br>
20  particle size of up to 0.5 mm, and a mixture consisting of 70% by volume of Al2Ti05, 20% by volume of  A1203 and 10% by<br>
	volume of Si,02 was prepared and used for the coarse particle<br>
 portion with a particle size in excess of , 0 . 5 mm.<br>
	Using this crucible, a rare earth alloy was melted as<br>
25  in Example 7.  The crucible failed during the slag removal  operation at the end of 196th melting cycle.  The products of these 196 cycles were in an average yiel,d of 98.8%, and the average time taJcen for slag removal was II minutes.<br>
30  Comprative Example  5<br>
A crucible was prepared as in Example 7 except that A1203 was used for both the fine particle portion with a particle size of up to 0.5 mm and the coarse particle portion with a particle size in excess of  0.5 mm.<br>
35        Using this crucible, a rare earth alloy was melted as in Example  7 The crucible failed during the slag removal operation at the end of 36th melting cycle- The products of<br><br><br>
these 36 cycles were in an average yield of 98.0%, and the average time taken for slag removal was 33 minutes.<br>
A crucible was prepared as in Example 7 except that A1203 was used for the fine particle portion with a particle size of up to 0.5 mm and Al2TiO5 was used for the coarse particle portion with a particle size in excess of 0.5 mm.<br>
Using "this crucible, a rare earth alloy was melted as in Example 7. The crucible failed during the slag removal operation at the end of 51st melting cycle. The products of these 51 cycles were in an average yield of 98.2%, and the average time taken for slag removal' was 24 minutes.<br>
The results of the foregoing Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in Table 2.<br>

As shown in Table 2, a comparison of(Examples 7-9 with Comparative Examples 5-6 reveals that Examples, containing rare earth oxide at a higher proportion in -the, portion having a particle size of up to 0.5 mm succeed in significantly increasing the use cycles of the crucible and are easy to remove slag and improved in product yield.<br>
A comparison of Example 7 with Example 4 reveals that the life of the crucible is significantly prolonged using , Al2Ti05.     <br><br>
When A1203 or Si02 is added in order to increase the strength of the crucible as in Examples 8 and 9, the use cycles are further increased despite some drops in product yield and slag removal time as compared with Example 7.<br>
As described above, the present invention is successful in extending the lifetime of the crucible, reducing the slag removal time, increasing the throughput of products, reducing the labor cost, and achieving an increase in product yield.<br><br>
