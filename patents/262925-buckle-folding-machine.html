BUCKLE FOLDING MACHINE<br>
The invention is with regard to a buckle folding machine with several parallel work rolls, which are together located in a bogie that can be brought to rotate by a drive mechanism and that pivots in a machine body for collecting, folding and ejecting the folding product, whereby at least one of the circulating work rolls can be relocated.<br>
The invention emanates from prior art in accordance with WO 94/08882, whose contents are herewith made reference to. Four work rolls with the same outer diameter are together located in a circulating bogie that is supported in a machine body. A conveyor mating roll, similarly supported in the machine body, can be controlled by a slotted link and works together with the slotted link during collection and when forming the first fold. The bogie is brought into rotation for collecting, folding and ejecting the paper via a drive mechanism, whereby one of the work rolls can be relocated with this circulating roll by means of a cam and forms the second fold together with another work roll. Control takes place through the circulating bogie via the internal cam and/or via the speed ratio between the work rolls and the bogie in the case of full electronic control. The paper is pulled in, folded and ejected while the bogie is circulating. Rolls operating in the collection area are operated counter to the paper feed and are, therefore, covered by a guide body, which necessitates a larger apparatus diameter.<br>
The objective of the invention is to considerably decrease the dimensions of the established buckle folding machine and to increase its efficiency.<br>
The objective is met, in accordance with the invention, in that the movable work roll as a edging roller is a component of a edging body that can be tilted and can be relocated in a radial manner along a longitudinal axis running parallel to<br><br>
the work roll, whereby the edging body is provided to work together with the adjacent work rolls to compress the folding product and to feed a folding gap and is mandatorily relocated by at least one curved section of an expanding cam to a position in which a folding product is allowed to pass through as well as to a position in which to compress the folding product. The design of the moveable work rolls as an edging body results in a reduction by approximately 20% in the structure of the buckle folding machine with four work rolls that have the same external diameter, since with the elimination of those work rolls present in the collection area, coverage required due to the rotation direction moving in the opposite direction is dispensed with.<br>
Another feature, in accordance with the invention, provides for the edging body comprising a framework and an edging roller located to rotate therein, whereby the framework covers the edging roller along its longitudinal axis at at least one location.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the invention, the framework of the edging body that can be relocated in a radial manner, can be relocated between the work rolls by a side covering the edging roller during the edging procedure in order to feed the folding product to a folding gap.<br>
Another feature of the invention provides for the framework of the edging body being supported in such a manner by at least two pressure springs against the bogie that the edging body can be moved against the spring force, essentially in a radial direction.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the invention, the framework of the edging body is provided with cylindrical bearing pins located on both sides on<br><br>
which control rollers sit, whereby the control rollers cause an essentially radial relocation of the edging body against the force of the pressure springs due to unrolling by an expanding cam that is located in the machine's body.<br>
Another feature in accordance with the invention provides for the bearing shaft of the edging roller being positioned displaced to the bearing shaft of the framework as well as to the bearing shaft of the control rollers, whereby the edging body can be tilted over the bearing shaft of the framework and whereby a force-fit connection of the edging roller with a second work roll exists even in the case of varying folding product thicknesses during the edging procedure.<br>
Another feature of the invention provides for a guide bridge adjacent to the edging body that moves along with the bogie and that partially covers the adjacent work rolls, this guide bridge forming a feed duct for the folding product together with the edging body.<br>
A conveyor mating roll is provided in accordance with another feature of the invention, which, in an in principle established manner, brings about feeding of the folding products to the machine together with the adjacent work roll and causes the first seam of the folding product, whereby the bearing shaft of the conveyor mating roll is guided along the side window of the bogie designed as a control curve. Mechanical control of the folding station is provided by the circulating bogie for various types of folding and folding product lengths, whereby the folding product is collected, folded and ejected during the step by step or continuous circulation of the bogie.<br>
Another feature in accordance with the invention provides for the conveyor rolls being connected to one another by tilting elements, whereby a locking surface<br><br>
is located at the tilting elements which prevents the folding product from bursting out during formation of the first edging loop between the conveyor rolls.<br>
Other advantageous features of the invention can be gathered from the description, claims and drawings. The invention is described in greater detail by means of a few exemplary embodiments and drawings.<br>
Figure 1 presents a longitudinal section of a bogie of a buckle folding machine with two lateral frame mounts and a top view of the edging body. Figure 2 illustrates a section through the buckle folding machine of Figure 1. Figure 3 is an interior view of the buckle folding machine in the side window and a top view as well as a view through the frame mount. Figure 4 presents a side view of the tilting element. A side view of the edging body is illustrated in Figure 5, while Figure 6 presents a longitudinal section of the edging body. Figure 7 schematically illustrates the position of the edging body in the buckle folding machine in the case of unobstructed feed motion of the folding product. Figure 8 is a schematic illustration of the position of the edging body in the folding machine during the edging function. Figures 9 to 14 are each a schematic presentation of roller positions that take place in succession during a 360° folding procedure with the respective positions of the edging body together with the folding product.<br>
Figures 1 to 3 present a buckle folding machine with stationary frame mounts (12, 13) in which a bogie (14) pivots, the latter containing three work rolls (15, 16, 17) that are parallel to one another and that work together with a similarly moveably supported edging body (1) and with a conveyor mating pair (19, 20) that are movably supported in the side frame mounts (12, 13) during folding of the folding product (18). The work rolls (15, 16, 17) are provided with bearing<br><br>
shafts (15a, 16a, 17a) at both their front sides, which pivot in the side windows (28, 29) of the bogie (14). The frame shafts of the bogie are designed as a hollow shaft (30) and as solid shaft (31) and pivot in the side frame mounts.<br>
The edging body (1) presented in Figures 1, 2, 5 and 6 comprises a framework (2) with spring guides (3) with which to accept pressure springs (4) as well as bearing shafts (7a, 8a) for pivoting support of the control rollers (7, 8) and bearing bushes (9, 10) with which to accept the bearing shaft (11a) of the control roller (11). The edging body (1) is located in such a manner in the bogie that its two lateral bearing pins (5, 6) and the bearing shafts (7a, 8a) are pushed from inside towards the outside through two openings designed as edging body guides (33) in the side windows (28, 29) of the bogie (14) and can be mandatorily relocated in an essentially radial manner via control rollers (7, 8) rolling on an expanding cam (34) against spring pressure of the pressure springs (4) counter supported in the bogie on dischargers (43). The rounded shape of the bearing pins (5, 6) and the bearing shafts (7a, 8a) of the control rollers (7, 8) located with an offset and the bearing shaft (11a) of the edging roller (11) additionally permit a tilting movement in the edging body guide (33) via a tilting axis (35) of the edging body. The expanding cam (34) is fixed or can be relocated at that side of the frame mount (12, 13) that faces the bogie (14). The bogie can be brought to rotate manually or with a motor using a mechanical connection at the solid shaft (31) that is not illustrated here, via the frame shaft. A roller drive shaft (36) designed as a solid shaft is directed through the hollow shaft (30) presented in Figure 1, which has a drive pinion (37) at its inner end with which to drive the work rolls (15, 16, 17) and is connected at its outer end via a gear pinion to a motor or to a manually operated drive device (not illustrated). The drive pinion (37) located at the inner end of the roller drive shaft meshes together with the gear pinions (38) of the work rolls (16, 17). The two conveying rollers (19, 20) that function as collection and edging rollers are guided with their bearing shafts (19a, 20a) through the side windows (28, 29) and pre-loaded by means of tension springs<br><br>
(not illustrated) for engagement with the respective work rolls (16, 17, 18), whereby control rollers (21, 22, 23, 24) that are located on the bearing shafts, (19a, 20a) roll on control curves (27) of the side windows (28, 29), the control curves being designed as control surfaces that generate force-fit connections with the work rolls (16, 17, 18) corresponding to the control program while the bogie (14) is circulating. The preceding conveyor roller (19) is moved along its bearing shaft (19a) in guideways (40) in the frame shaft (12, 13). The subsequent conveyor roller (20) is connected to the preceding conveyor roller by tilting elements (25, 26). With its locking surface (41), tilting elements (25, 26) prevent the folding product from bursting out from the buckle folding machine through the gap between the conveyor rollers (19, 20) during formation of the first edging loop in the region of the first seam gap between the work rolls (15) and (16).<br>
Figures 7 and 8 present an edging body (1), mandatorily relocated against spring pressure by an internal expanding cam (34) provided in an edging body guide (33), in the position of unobstructed transport of the folding product (18) as well as during a folding procedure. The cylindrical design of the bearing pins (5, 6) also facilitates an oscillating movement through the tilting axis (35) of the edging body (1) during radial relocation in the guideways (33) and, therewith, a force-fit connection of the edging rollers (11) with the work rolls (15) through the offset location of the bearing shaft (11a) of the edging roller (11) in the case of simultaneous edging function. The edging body forms a feed duct (39) together with a guide bridge (42) of the bogie (14) that runs along with the bogie and partially covers the work rolls (15).<br>
Figures 9 to 14 present consecutive locations of the bogie of the buckle folding machine during a complete folding procedure with respective positions of the edging body (1), in accordance with the invention. In principle, different types of folds can be executed by the machine such as, for example, a folded spiral<br><br>
seam or a zigzag fold. The procedure in the example illustrates a folded spiral seam. The folding product (18) is guided in this example by an upstream device between the conveyor mating roll (19, 20) and the work roll (15) (refer Figure 9). The drive mechanism for the bogie (14) and for the work rolls (15, 16, 17) are set in motion after a precisely defined paper feed rate. Arrows in Figures 9 to 14 indicate the rotating direction of the rolls and of the bogie. Control curves (27) of the side windows (28, 29) designed as control surfaces, permit swivelling of the conveyor rolls (19, 20) towards the bogie (14) where the folding product (18), lying between the conveyor rolls and the work rolls, (15) can be conveyed to the conveyor rolls (19) in the folding device by the impact of the work rolls (15) (refer Figure 10). The constant transmission ratio between work rolls (15, 16, 17) and the bogie (14) causes the work roll (16) to impact upon the conveyor roll (19) during continued rotation of the bogie, precisely at that location at which the folding product must be guided back against the feed direction in connection with the work roll (15) and conveyor roller (20) driven in the opposite direction for formation of the first edging loop and for its acceptance by work rolls (15) and (16) (refer Figure 11). The edging body (1) that has in the meantime been driven outwards in a radial manner by the expanding cam (34), permits further feed of the folding product (18) with the first folding edge at the front side (refer Figure 12). Through further rotation of the bogie (14) with the three work rolls (15, 16, 17) and the edging body (1), the same is guided back again after passage of the stationary expanding cam (34) as a result of the constant transmission ratio to precisely that location to which the folding product (18) must be guided back for the formation of the second edging loop in connection with the work roll (17) that is driven in the opposite direction. Due to the edging body guide (33) in the side windows (28) and (29), the edging body (1) is first guided to the work roll (15) with which the edging roller (11) produces a force-fit connection and is driven by the same. In further sequences, the offset axis of the edging body cause a tilting movement towards the work roll (17) through which the folding product, guided unrestrictedly between the work roll (17) and the edging roller (11), is accepted and guided back (refer Figure 13). This design permits precise folding even in<br><br>
the case of paper of varying thicknesses. Figure 14 illustrates work rolls (16) and (17) which grasp the edging loop, fold the folding product (18) during further transportation and eject the same thereafter. The bogie (14) continues to rotate till zero position.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
