				<td>This invention relates to a process for non-stic cookware utensils, which can cook the food/vegetables/non-vegetarian dishes in a very tasty and hygienic manner with a less cooking oil. Exterior is decorated with vitreous enamel and permanent decoration with designs/flowers.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a non-stic cookware which can cook in a better way having its exterior to serve on the table with total hygienic..<br>
The cookware available in the market are only attractive but do not prepare the food articles in a better way as the non-stic chemical applied on the inner side is mostly scratches off due to rotation of the food article by serving spoons The non-stic cookware available in the market can only be given rotation by the wooden spatula. Another disadvantage of the non-stic cookware is that the material employed/used is of aluminum which is malleable and very soft in its form there by when using the cookware on heat looses the shape of the utensils/deformed and due to deformation the exterior shape gives its way and mostly the exterior paint peels off on direct heating (paint is backed at upto 280° centigrade) and the user has to throw the cookware after some use as it gives very bad impressions/look.<br>
Contd.. 3/P...<br>
Another disadvantage is the interior portion on which the non-stic coating is used peal off after some time and the chemical used in the aluminum interior (base of non-stic ware)portion mixes with the food articles which is being prepared thereby possibly causing the food poisoning/hazard to a particular person.<br>
The cook and serve available in the market are not coated with non-stic properties it is coated with vitreous enamel on mild steel with exterior and interior both due to this the non-stic qualities/properties cannot be obtained thereby customer has to use oil while cooking which is dangerous to the health of a person. As the oil/ghee used is not good for health.<br>
The object of the invention is to produce non-stic cook ware where in the base material used is of high quality and of less carbon contents almost to a low carbon content sheet on mild steel sheet which is almost low carbon sheet is covered with a food grade stainless steel layer from inside the enameled cookware. It is like a wall between non-stic coating and Mild steel sheet (coated with vitreous enamel) which holds grip the non-stic coating much better.<br>
Contd. ,4/P...<br>
Another object of the invention is to produce a non-stic cookware where the oil consumed is almost negligible thereby there is a saving of oil/ghee and more particularly to have a food article prepared in non-stic cookware which will not have any adverse effect on the health of a person.<br>
The non-stic cookware of stainless steel available in the market can not be interior coated by a paint which is non-stic as the stainless steel will not accept the paint. In view of this the material used with the new non-stic cookware with low carbon sheet which gives the best results and non-stic paint can very smoothly stic to the inside of the utensil/cookware.<br>
Accordingly the present invention related to process for making<br>
non-stick cookware utensils comprising a low carbon sheet and<br>
fabricated to a desired shape required for utensils, said fabricated<br>
utensils are coated from out side and inside with vitreous enamel and<br>
baked at 850°-900°, characterized In that on the inside of the cookware<br>
a food grade stainless steel is layered on the pores with a specific metal<br>
spray injecting machine, applying a first coat of non-stick food grade<br>
material onto the sprayed steel material, applying a second coat of food<br>
grade material on to the first coat for making the surface smooth,<br>
heating the said coated utensils in a furnace upto 450° and fitting a ring<br>
of stainless steel at edge of cookware, the process is repeated atleast<br>
two times and finally taken to a conveyer belt or furnace and baked upto<br>
450°. Contd...5/P...<br>
The process of making the non-stic cookware is given below in detail.<br>
The low carbon Mild Steel Sheet is taken of the required size gouge and is placed in a Die of required shape and size. The material is drawn on processes of required capacity. The cookware so produced will be taken to a tank for pickling so that the grease from the cookware drawn from the processes is free from all the these defects. The cookware after pickling are taken to processed for making pores from Inside of the cookware with specific equipment and grains/mash. After the pores the cookware are coated from outside and inside with vitreous enamels applying maximum three coats to enable to have a better quality and to look beautiful (indifferent colour). After the outside enamel the cookware are taken to a furnace with conveyer belt and are heated upto 850° C temperature, then they are taken out from furnace and are cooled to a room temperature and decorative designs/flowers are pasted on exterior and are again baked to have a permanent decoration on the exterior portion now cookware are taken to a specific machine for blasting to make pores inside the cookware. After that the food grade stainless steel is layered on the pores, so that mild steel sheet coated with vitreous enameled contents may not come out, with a specific metal spray injecting machine. The cookware are then Cont...6/P...<br>
finally coated from inside with a food grade material The coating material sticks in the pours of the stainless steel layered cookware and pourcity is filled with non-stic food grade coating. 2nd coat is applied to have a smooth surface. They are then taken to a conveyer belt-furnace and heated upto 450UC for safety purpose a ring of stainless steel fixed upon the edges of cookware.. The product so produced is finally packed and sent to the market.<br>
Note;- Between enameled Mild Steel Sheet and non-stic coating a layer of food grade stainless steel is applied to prevent the Mild Steel Sheet contents comes out from inside,<br>
A metal spoon can be used freely. Contd ,7/P .<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :-<br>
1. A process for making a non-stick utensils, comprising a low carbon sheet, fabricated to a desired shape required for utensils, said, fabricated utensils are coated from out side and inside with vitreous enamel and baked at 850°-900°, characterized in that on the inside of the cookware a food grade stainless steel is layered on the pores with a specific metal spray injecting machine, applying a first coat of non-stick food grade material onto the sprayed steel material, applying a second coat of food grade material on to the first coat for making the surface smooth, heating the said coated utensils in a furnace upto 450° and fitting a ring of stainless steel at edge of cookware.<br>
2 A process for making non-stic cookware utensils as claimed in the claim-1, where in the non stick food grade material coating is polytetrafloro ethylene (P<br></td>
