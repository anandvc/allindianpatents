				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing granular urea from a urea solution.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing granular urea from liquid drops or sprayed drops of a urea solution.  In the present invention, the urea liquid means a general term of molten urea and an aqueous urea solution. Description of the Related Art<br>
Various processes for preparing granular urea are known.  In general, a prilling tower method and a fluidized, spouted bed method are employed.<br>
In the prilling rower mecnoa, an dqueuua urea solution containing a moisture of 0.1 to 0.3 % by weight is caused to fall from the top of a prilling tower in the form of liquid droplets, and fallen liquid drops are cooled and solidified by contacting them with an ascending air current coming from the bottom of the prilling tower, whereby urea particles called prill is produced.<br><br>
Urea grains obtained by this method are relatively small (0.5 to 2.5 mm) and have a low mechanical strength.<br>
The fluidized, spouted bed method is used to produce a grain which is larger than the grain produced by the prilling tower method and has a high mechanical strength and is specifically disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,219,589 and JP-B-4-63729<br>
For example, a method is disclosed in JP-B-4-63729, in which a urea solution is fed in the form of fine liquid drops into a fluidized bed in which a spouted bed comprising urea seed grains is scattered, to adhere the urea solution on the urea seed particles, followed by drying and solidifying it, whereby the large-sized urea grains are produced.<br>
As disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,067,177, U.S. Patent 3,112,343 and JP-B-50-34536, it is well known that in these processes for preparing granular urea by the fluidized, spouted bed method, an additive is added to a urea solution for the purposes to improve a mechanical strength and a<br><br>
coagulation resistance of a large-sized urea grain product and enhance a granulating efficiency, that is, reduce a proportion to lose a part of the urea solution in the form of very fine dusts without being used for forming the grains in granulating. This additive is an aqueous formaldehyde solution or a urea/formaldehyde reaction product (it is commercially available under a trade name of, for example, Formurea 80).<br>
In the process for preparing prill urea by the prilling tower method, it is substantially impossible to remove a moisture in the steps. A mechanical strength and a coagulation resistance of the resulting urea grains can be improved by adding 0.3 to 0.6 % by weight of formaldehyde. However, the use of an aqueous formaldehyde solution as a formaldehyde source results in adding a lot of water to urea together because a content of formaldehyde in the aqueous formaldehyde solution is usually 30 to 37 % by weight and a large quantity of water is contained therein. This increases a moisture contained in the resulting<br><br>
urea grains and in turn deteriorates the quality of the urea grains. Accordingly, an aqueous formaldehyde solution can not be used for the prilling tower method in which a moisture in the steps can not be removed.<br>
On the other hand, a process for preparing large-sized urea grains by the fluidized, spouted bed method has a capability to evaporate a moisture to some extent in the granulating facility thereof. However, in the case where a moisture exceeding an evaporation capability of the granulating facility is contained, for example, in the case where a more diluted aqueous formaldehyde solution than that expected in designing can not help being used, a water content of a urea and formaldehyde mixture has to be reduced down to a given level or lower before introducing it into the granulating facility.<br>
As described above, an aqueous formaldehyde solution usually contains 30 to 37 % by weight of formaldehyde and therefore contains a lot of water. The use of this aqueous formaldehyde solution concentrated simply to 37 % by weight or more<br><br>
results in deteriorating the stability of the aqueous formaldehyde solution and depositing a polymer of formaldehyde, which in turn makes it difficult to feed formaldehyde in a prescribed amount.<br>
Meanwhile, in the granulating processes having no drying ability in a granulating mechanism, such as a pan type granulating method and a drum type granulating method, water has to be prevented from being mixed in.  In such granulating processes, an aqueous formaldehyde solution can not be used as is the case with the prilling tower method. Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide means for solving a problem for removing a moisture in the prilling tower method and a problem for concentrating a diluted aqueous formaldehyde solution in granulating by the fluidized, spouted bed method, when urea is granulated in the presence of formaldehyde.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a process for preparing granular urea from a liquid<br><br>
drops or sprayed drops of a urea solution, wherein the urea solution is divided into two portions of a urea solution A and another urea solution B, and a urea solution prepared by mixing an aqueous formaldehyde solution with the urea solution A, concentrating the above mixed solution and then mixing it with the urea solution B is used/the process for preparing granular urea as described above, wherein the amount of the above urea solution A is controlled to 0.5 or more based on the amount of formaldehyde added to the urea solution in terms of a molar ratio of urea/formaldehyde; and<br>
the process for preparing granular urea as described above, wherein the pH is adjusted to 6.5 or more when the above urea solution A is mixed with the aqueous formaldehyde solution and the mixed solution is concentrated.<br>
In other words, the invention provides a process for preparing granular urea from liquid drops or sprayed drops of a urea solution, which comprises the steps of dividing the urea solution<br><br>
into two portions A and B, mixing the portion A with an aqueous formaldehyde solution, concentrating the mixture and mixing the concentrated A with the portion B and then granulating the mixture of A and B.<br>
It is preferable that the portion A is mixed with the aqueous formaldehyde solution at a mole ratio of urea of the portion A to formaldehyde in the range of 0.5 or larger.<br>
It is preferable that the mixing of the portion A with the aqueous formaldehyde solution and the concentration are conducted at a pH value of 6.5<br>
or larger.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an improved process for preparing<br>
granular urea from a urea solution, which comprises the steps of:<br>
a.	dividing the urea solution into two portions A and B;<br>
b.	mixing the portion A with ammonia and an aqueous formaldehyde solution to form a<br>
mixture;<br>
c.	concentrating the mixture and mixing the concentrated mixture with the portion B to<br>
form a resultant mixture; and<br>
d.	granulating the resultant mixture;<br>

2	Evaporator<br>
4    Vacuum  pump<br><br>
5 Granulating column or facility Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention shall be explained below in detail.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the process for preparing granular urea according to the present invention including a granulating facility (hereinafter called a granulating facility 5) based on the prilling tower method or the fluidized, spouted bed method. The facility according to the present invention comprises a mixer 1 in which the aqueous formaldehyde solution can be mixed with the urea solution and the mixed solution can be heated, an evaporator 2 for evaporating water contained in the mixed solution coming out of the mixer 1, and a vacuum condenser 3 for condensing evaporated water.<br>
The urea solution is divided into the urea solution A and the urea solution B before the granulating facility 5, and as shall be described later, the urea solution B is mixed with the urea solution A which has been back again and introduced<br><br>
into the granulating facility through a line 11.<br>
The urea solution A is charged into the mixer<br>
I	through a line 12.  Introduced into the mixer 1<br>
are the aqueous formaldehyde solution through a<br>
line 13 and ammoni_a_£iir.ougti,_a_ line 14/___resjDective.ly.<br>
In the mixer 1, the urea solution is homogeneously<br>
mixed with formaldehyde, and urea is reacted with<br>
formaldehyde if necessary. Conditions for this<br>
reaction shall be described later. The resulting<br>
mixture of the urea solution A and the aqueous<br>
formaldehyde solution is returned again to the line<br>
II	through a line 16 after concentrated in the<br>
evaporator 2, mixed with the urea solution B and<br>
then sent to the granulating facility 5.<br>
The amount of the urea solution A is determined in such manner that the addition amount of formaldehyde is determined so that the amount of formaldehyde is 0.3 to 0.6 % by weight based on the amount of urea fed to the granulating facility 5 and a ratio of urea contained in the mixer 1 to the above formaldehyde amount is 0.5 or more in terms of a molar ratio of urea/formaldehyde. That is, a<br><br>
weight ratio A/T of the amount of the urea solution A to the total urea amount T is 2af, wherein f is a weight ratio the formaldehyde amount/the total amount of urea, and a is a molar ratio the amount of the urea solution A/the amount of formaldehyde.<br>
The molar ratio of less than 0.5 is liable to increase a molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea and form a polymer of urea and formaldehyde.<br>
If the molar ratio is increased more than needed, for example, 5.0 or more, the amount of urea heated is increased more than needed when the mixture of urea and formaldehyde is heated and used as a reaction product of urea and formaldehyde, which results in increasing the formation of biuret which is a by-product.  In usual cases, the amount of the urea solution A is a very small value based on the total amount of urea.<br>
The urea solution A and formaldehyde contribute sufficiently to an improvement in a mechanical strength and a coagulation resistance of the large-sized urea grain product only by mixing and concentrating (the divided urea solutions have<br><br>
a chance to be heated and reacted at the time when they are put together again and sent to the granulating facility 5). However, as shall be described later, they are more preferably reacted in advance to such an extent that polymerization is not caused (hereinafter both the mixed solution of the urea solution A and formaldehyde, and the reaction solution of them are called mixed solutions).<br>
In the reaction of urea with formaldehyde, the lower the pH of the mixed solution is and the higher the temperatures are, the more easily the polymer of urea and formaldehyde is formed.  In order to prevent this polymer from being formed, the pH is preferably maintained at 6.5 or higher by feeding ammonia gas or aqueous ammonia. The pH of less than 6.5 is liable to form the polymer of urea and formaldehyde and increases the polymerization rate even if the reaction temperature is maintained low. Accordingly, the polymer is formed before concentration, and the substantial concentration becomes impossible.<br><br>
However, the pH of 9.5 or higher retards the reaction rate and increases formaldehyde which is not yet reacted with urea.  Further, formaldehyde is evaporated to a gas side by heating in a concentration step, and more amount of formaldehyde is consumed for providing a formaldehyde amount based on a prescribed urea amount. Further, caused are the problems that a consumed amount of ammonia is increased more than needed and ammonia odor damages the workability, and therefor the pH has to be restricted to less than 9.5.<br>
The reaction of urea, formaldehyde and ammonia is an exothermic reaction, and the temperature of the mixed solution is elevated due to the reaction heat. Accordingly, the heat has to be removed by cooling water. This removal of heat for maintaining a suitable temperature is important for preventing the polymer from being formed.  That is, the reaction temperature is maintained preferably at 40 to 100°C in a condition of pH 6.5 or higher.  The temperature of lower than 40°C retards the reaction rate, and the temperature<br><br>
exceeding 100°C forms the polymer in some cases before the concentration.<br>
The mixed solution obtained in the mixer 1 is introduced into the evaporator 2 through a line 15 for concentration. The evaporator 2 is fed with heat needed for evaporation by steam to evaporate and remove a part of water from the mixed solution. The operating pressure is preferably controlled to a vacuum degree of such an extent that the temperature of the solution is not elevated by heating. Vacuum is formed by a vacuum pump 4 disposed in a downstream of the vacuum condenser 3. Steam evaporated from the evaporator 2 is sent to the vacuum condenser 3 through a line 17 to be cooled into condensed water and discharged to the outside of the system.<br>
On the other hand, the mixed solution concentrated to a prescribed concentration is returned again to the urea solution line 11 through the line 16 and mixed with the urea solution B. Then, it is sent to the granulating facility to prepare granular urea.<br><br>
In the present invention, a portion of the urea solution is withdrawn as the urea solution A before the granulating facility and mixed with the aqueous formaldehyde solution. Then, the mixed solution is concentrated and used again for preparing granular urea together with the remaining urea solution B. Accordingly, granular urea can be prepared without increasing a moisture contained in the product.  The urea solution A withdrawn from the urea solution is maintained to 0.5 or more in terms of a molar ratio of urea/formaldehyde, and therefore the polymerization caused in heating and concentrating is controlled. Since the urea solution A is reacted with formaldehyde under a condition of pH 6.5 or higher, the polymerization is suppressed.<br>
In the present invention, a portion of the urea solution is withdrawn as the urea solution A before the granulating facility. Formaldehyde is added to it and the resulting mixture is concentrated and mixed again with the remaining urea solution B to prepare granular urea.<br><br>
Accordingly, the diluted aqueous formaldehyde solution can be used as a formaldehyde source.<br>
The urea solution A withdrawn from the urea solution is controlled to 0.5 or more in terms of a molar ratio of urea/formaldehyde, and therefore the polymerization scarcely takes place during heating and concentrating.<br>
The urea solution A is reacted with formaldehyde in a condition of pH 6.5 or higher, and therefore a concentration operation is possible while preventing the polymerization of urea with formaldehyde.<br>
Further, urea exposed to heating can be controlled to a very small amount as compared with the whole amount of urea, and therefore the formation of biuret which is a by-product contained in the product can be neglected.<br>
Examples<br>
The examples of the present invention shall specifically be described below with reference to examples. Example 1<br><br>
In a plant for producing urea of 41,667 kg/h, the urea solution A of 417 kg/h was withdrawn from the urea solution sent to the granulating facility 5 (spouted, fluidized bed granulating facility disclosed in JP-B-4-63729) and sent to the mixer 1 through the line 12.  Further, the aqueous formaldehyde solution (formalin) of 694 kg/h containing 30 % by weight of formaldehyde was sent to the mixer I through the line 13 so that a ratio of urea to formalin was 1. Ammonia of 10 kg/h was sent through the line 14 so that the pH of the mixer 1 was about 8, and urea was reacted with formaldehyde. Heat generated in the mixer 1 was removed by cooling water to maintain the<br>
temperature of the mixed solution at 70 to 75°C.<br>
The mixed solution was sent to the evaporator 2 and concentrated to 75 % at an operating pressure of absolute pressure 150 mm Hg in a condition of<br>
80°C. The concentration was carried out by heating by steam, and the amount of needed steam was about 310 kg/h. Water separated from the mixed solution in the form of steam was 264 kg/h, and it was<br><br>
cooled, condensed and recovered in the vacuum condenser 3.  The concentrated urea/formaldehyde mixed solution thus obtained was sent to the granulating facility 5 through the line 16 after mixed with the remaining urea solution B.  The urea solution thus obtained containing about 0.5 % by weight of formaldehyde was used to prepare granular urea in the granulating facility 5.<br>
Granular urea thus obtained was dried further in the granulating facility 5, and granular urea containing finally a water content of 0.2 % by weight was obtained. This product was characterized by having a high mechanical strength and less damage during transportation.  For example, the product crushing strength of 25 to 35 N/2.7 mm was obtained. Comparative Example 1<br>
The mixer 1 was operated in the same manner as that in Example 1, except that ammonia mixed with the urea solution A was changed from 10 kg/hr to 2 kg/hr.  Initially, the pH was 8 but lowered down to 6 in the outlet of the mixer, and a polymer<br><br>
was formed, which made a following operation<br>
impossible.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same procedure as that in Example 1 was repeated, except that the operating condition of the evaporator 2 was changed to absolute pressure 120 mm Hg to concentrate the mixed solution to 80 %.<br>
The urea solution for granular urea thus obtained was used to prepare prill urea by a conventional method, and prill urea having a water content of 0.3 % by weight was obtained. This product had a product crushing strength of 10 to 15 N/1.7 mm.<br><br><br><br>
