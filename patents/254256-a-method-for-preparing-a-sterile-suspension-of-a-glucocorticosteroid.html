				<td>The present invention relates to a method for preparing a sterile suspension of a<br>
glucocorticosteroid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Sterile drug products provide a number of benefits, both medically and<br>
economically. The medical ramifications requiring sterile drug preparations are clear in that the<br>
use of non-sterile preparations may subject the patient to an unnecessary risk of secondary<br>
infection from the contaminating microbe, a microbe that is at least resistant to the drugs of the .<br>
preparation. Furthermore, even if the contaminant is innocuous, the growth can result in loss of<br>
active drug products per se with possible concomitant generation of toxic by-products.<br>
Economically, contaminated drug products have a shortened shelf life, which requires increased<br>
production expenses to replace product on a more frequent basis.<br>
[0003] Methods are needed for the preparation of sterile products for patient use.<br>
However, the problem associated with many sterilization procedures is that the process often<br>
results in unfavorable changes in the drug profile. These changes in the drug profile can range<br>
from loss of activity, to increased degradation products being created, or possible alteration of<br>
the chemical or physical characteristics of the compound sterilized. These problems are<br>
especially pronounced when glucocorticosteroids are sterilized.<br>
[0004] Sterilization of materials relies on the input of sufficient energy to be lethal to any<br>
potential microbial contamination. Numerous methods including heat, radiation, and chemicals<br>
have been proposed for the sterilization of glucocorticosteroids. However, to date these methods<br>
often result in the excess production of degradants or a loss of activity for the<br>
glucocorticosteroid being sterilized. Additionally, as in the case of glucocorticosteroid<br><br>
suspension formulations for metered dose inhalation, the commonly used sterilization<br>
procedures often results in unacceptable changes to drug particle size.<br>
[0005] Chemical sterilization, for the most part, has been based on exposure to toxic<br>
compounds, for example, ethylene oxide. However, when used to sterilize glucocorticosteroids,<br>
ethylene oxide has been found to leave residual amounts of ethylene oxide in the drug<br>
preparation. Ethylene oxide is toxic and the residual levels are often above the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable limits as set by most regulatory agencies.<br>
[0006]	Irradiation based sterilization is known and has been recommended for<br>
glucocorticosteroids (see Ilium and Moeller in Arch. Pharm. Chemi. Sci., Ed. 2, 1974, pp. 167-<br>
174). However, significant degradation has been reported when irradiation has been used to<br>
sterilize micronized glucocorticosteroids.<br>
[0007]	WO 00/25746 (Chiesi) discloses a process for preparing a suspension of a<br>
glucocorticosteroid. In a first step an aqueous carrier is mixed in a turboemulsifier and sterilized<br>
by heat treatment or filtration. In a second step a micronized active ingredient (e.g. a<br>
glucocorticosteroid), pre-sterilized by gamma irradiation, is added to the aqueous carrier.<br>
[0008]	WO 03/086347 (Chiesi) describes some of the disadvantages of WO 00/25746 and<br>
discloses an improvement in the process whereby the active ingredient is introduced into a<br>
turboemulsifier as a powder by exploiting the vacuum in the turboemulsifier. Again the active<br>
ingredient is sterilized prior to dispersion in the aqueous carrier.<br>
[0009]	Neither of these documents disclose the sterilisation by heating of an aqueous<br>
suspension of a glucocorticosteroid and hence the problem of particle size growth during the<br>
heating and subsequent cooling steps is not addressed.<br>
[0010]	US 3;962,430 (O'Neill) discloses a method for the production of sterile isotonic<br>
solutions of medicinal agents. The method comprises adding the medicinal agent to a saturated<br>
solution of sodium chloride in water at 100°C. The drug/saturated sodium chloride solution is<br>
then heated to 100-130°C. This method, which purportedly is based on the theory that the<br>
sodium chloride ions tie up free water thereby preventing hydrolytic degradation, is not suitable<br>
for suspensions of fine particles of glucocorticosteroids intended for inhalation, as the procedure<br>
produces unfavorable changes in the size of the particles. Additionally, the procedure can result<br>
in bridge formation between drug particles producing large aggregates, which do not break up<br>
on administration.<br><br>
[0011]	In order to address the problem of particle growth, US 6,392,036<br>
(Karlsson) discloses a method for the dry heat sterilization of powdered<br>
glucocorticosteroids that can then be used for drug formulations. However, this method<br>
results in unacceptable levels of heat-degradation products.<br>
[0012]	WO 2004/078102 (Dompe) discloses a method for sterilizing an aqueous<br>
suspension of a glucocorticosteroid consisting of the glucocorticosteroid and water only.<br>
Minimal detail is provided of the sterilisation apparatus.<br>

of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these<br>
specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in<br>
detail, in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention<br>
[0024]	Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the apparatus 1 used to manufacture and<br>
fill batches of a sterile glucocorticosteroid suspension. An excipient liquid, preferably an<br>
excipient solution, is prepared in a first vessel 2. Alternatively, the first vessel 2 is simply<br>
charged with water. The first vessel 2 is provided with a mixer 3 and a re-circulation line 4. A<br>
concentrated glucocorticosteroid suspension is then manufactured and sterilized before being<br>
diluted with the sterile water or sterile excipient liquid. Accordingly, the apparatus 1 is provided<br>
with second and third vessels 5 and 6. The second and third vessels 5 and 6 are connected to the<br>
first vessel 2 by line 7 having a sterilizing-grade filter 8. Before, during and/or after the<br>
sterilization of the concentrated glucocorticosteroid suspension, the suspension is re-circulated<br>
via re-circulation line 9 and homogenizer 10. After sterilization the sterilized concentrated<br>
glucocorticosteroid suspension is passed via re-circulation line 11 for dilution with the sterile<br>
water or excipient liquid in the second vessel 5. The suspension is then passed via line 12 for<br>
packaging into suitable containers at blow-fill-seal (BFS) machine 13. These process steps are<br>
summarized in Fig. 2.<br>
[0025] Each step will now be described in more detail.<br>
[0026] The excipient liquid is prepared in a first vessel 2. Prior to mixing, the first vessel 2<br>
is cleaned and either sanitized or sterilized in place, for example using hot water for injections<br>
(WFI) followed by steam sanitization using steam at temperatures of not less than 100°C for not<br>
less than 15 mins. After sanitization or sterilization the water is introduced or the excipient<br>
liquid is prepared as required. The excipient liquid comprises water and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient, such as a surfactant and preferably further comprises other<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents, etc., such as at least one buffer, at least one<br>
salt, and at least one wetting agent, stabilizing agent and/or isotonic agent. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable surfactants are well known in the art and are exemplified by Polysorbates, e.g.<br>
Polysorbate 80. The components may be added in any order although preferably the required<br>
quantity of water, e.g. WFI, is charged into the mixing vessel followed by the other components<br>
which are added to the circulating water via an additions hopper (not shown).<br>
[0027]	Preferably at least about 50%, more preferably about 70-90% of the total quantity<br>
of surfactant required in the sterile glucocorticosteroid suspension is added at this stage.<br>
Following this addition, the additions hopper is rinsed with the circulating solution and the<br>
solution is mixed, e.g. for 10 mins, to ensure complete dissolution using a mixer 3 and re-<br>
circulation line 4 to form the excipient liquid which is preferably a homogenous excipient<br>
solution.<br>
[0028]	A concentrated suspension of a glucocorticosteroid is prepared and sterilized in the<br>
third vessel 6 (also termed the "concentrate vessel"). The third vessel 6 has a re-circulation line<br>
9 incorporating a homogenizer 10. However, prior to sterilisation of the glucocorticosteroid<br>
suspension, the remainder of the apparatus 1 including the second vessel 5, the third vessel 6 and<br>
the filtration line 7 as well as any additional components, may be cleaned and sterilized in place,<br>
for example using hot WFI followed by steam at temperatures of about 122°C to about 138°C<br>
for not less than 30 mins. Following sterilization, second vessel 5 and any other cleaned and<br>
sterilized components of apparatus 1 are continuously held under positive pressure to maintain<br>
the sterility of the system and contents during subsequent batch manufacture and filling. The<br>
positive pressure may be maintained using sterile compressed air.<br>
[0029]	The water or excipient liquid is sterilized and the second vessel 5 and the third<br>
vessel 6 are charged with the water or excipient liquid. Sterilization of the water or excipient<br>
liquid is completed by filtration via a sterilizing grade filter 8 during transfer of the water or<br>
excipient solution from first vessel 2 to both the second vessel 5 and the third vessel 6.<br>
However, alternative methods of sterilization could be employed, such as heat-treating the<br>
excipient liquid.<br>
[0030]	The third vessel 6 is isolated from second vessel 5 and the third vessel 6 is opened.<br>
At this stage surfactant is added to the water or additional surfactant may be added to the<br>
excipient liquid in the third vessel 6 in order to facilitate formation of a stable suspension.<br>
Preferably the concentration of the surfactant in the concentrated glucocorticosteroid suspension<br><br>
is from about 0.2 to about 300, more preferably from about 0.2 to about 60 mg/ml. The<br>
glucocorticosteroid is then added to the third vessel 6. The glucocorticosteroid does not need to<br>
have been sterilized at this stage. An overage of the glucocorticosteroid may be added if there<br>
are any process losses of the glucocorticosteroid during bulk product suspension manufacture<br>
and filling.<br>
[0031]	The concentration of the glucocorticosteroid in this "concentrated"<br>
glucocorticosteroid suspension is preferably from about 15 to about 300, more preferably about<br>
15 to about 150 mg/ml. In addition, it is preferred that at least 50% of the glucocorticosteroid in<br>
the glucocorticosteroid suspension is in the form of a suspension during heating, the remainder<br>
being held in solution. More preferably, at least 60% is in the form of a suspension.<br>
[0032]	The third vessel 6 is then sealed. The contents of the third vessel 6 are preferably<br>
re-circulated, e.g. for at least about 1 min, preferably for at least about 10 mins forming a<br>
homogenous suspension of glucocorticosteroid.<br>
[0033]	The third vessel 6 has at least two openings served by a re-circulation line 9. The<br>
re-circulation line 9 allows the content of the third vessel 6 to be removed from the third vessel 6<br>
at a first opening and re-charged into the third vessel 6 at a second opening. It is preferred that<br>
the first opening is at the bottom of the third vessel 6 and that the second opening is at the top.<br>
The force required to re-circulate the content is provided by the homogenizer 10. The content of<br>
the third vessel 6 is also caused to pass through the homogenizer 10 as it is re-circulated. Since<br>
homogenisation of the content, i.e. the glucocorticosteroid suspension, occurs as it passes<br>
through the re-circulation line 9, the third vessel 6 does not require any internal mechanism for<br>
agitation of the content. Indeed, in a preferred embodiment, the third vessel 6 is free of any<br>
agitation mechanism and most preferably the third vessel 6 consists essentially of a metallic (e.g.<br>
stainless steel) casing having a plurality of openings for charging and evacuating the vessel.<br>
Whilst the shape of the third vessel 6 is not critical, in order to avoid any dead space where the<br>
content may become trapped and unable to be evacuated, the third vessel is preferably<br>
cylindrical and more preferably has a conical bottom tapering towards the first opening. The<br>
simplicity of the third vessel 6 is particularly advantageous since it reduces the number of<br>
working parts and the overall surface area onto which the glucocorticosteroid suspension comes<br>
in contact, thereby reducing any loss of drug by adhesion to the surfaces, reducing the possible<br>
sources of contamination and reducing the time required for cleaning the apparatus.<br><br>
[0034]	Heat is applied to the sealed third vessel 6 using a heater 14, such as a steam jacket.<br>
The glucocorticosteroid suspension, third vessel 6, re-circulation line 9 and homogenizer 10 are<br>
sterilized in situ via heat transfer from the heater. Heating is carried out at a sterilizingly<br>
effective temperature for a sterilizingly effective time, preferably at a temperature of from about<br>
101 to about 145°C, more preferably from about 122°C to about 138°C, for about 2 to about 180<br>
mins, more preferably for at least about 30 mins.<br>
[0035] At this stage, the glucocorticosteroid suspension is circulated around the third<br>
vessel 6, re-circulation line 9 and homogenizer 10 to ensure effective sterilization of the system<br>
and glucocorticosteroid suspension. Fig. 3 shows the re-circulation of the glucocorticosteroid suspension during heat sterilization detailing the re-circulation line 9. Optionally, the<br>
concentrate may be pre-treated to reduce the particle size distribution of the glucocorticosteroid<br>
to a pre-specified value, including by circulation through the homogenizer. The<br>
glucocorticosteroid suspension is preferably circulated during the heating step although it may<br>
alternatively, or in addition, be circulated before or after the heating step. By re-circulating the<br>
concentrated glucocorticosteroid suspension through a homogenizer 10, an unwanted increase in<br>
particle size may be avoided.<br>
[0036] The homogenizer 10 is a device known in the art in which a suspension of a<br>
particulate material, here the glucocorticosteroid suspension, is subjected to an energetic shear<br>
as the suspension is forced to pass therethrough. The homogenizer provides a sufficiently high<br>
shear force to cause the break up of aggregates of particles in the suspension and a reduction in<br>
the solid particles sizes. A precise numerical range for the level of shear is not appropriate given<br>
that the level of shear will depend on the viscosity of the suspension. The homogenizer 10 may<br>
be an in-line high-shear homogenizer (e.g. a Silverson 150L) or, for more efficient and better<br>
particle size reduction, a high-pressure homogenizer (e.g. a. Niro Panda). A high-shear<br>
homogeniser typically has a mixing workhead comprising rotatable rotor blades and a perforated<br>
stator with the rotor blades located within the stator. A high-pressure homogeniser typically<br>
comprises a pump, which can supply pressures up to about 1500 bar, and one or more<br>
interaction chambers where the passage of fluid through minute flow passages under high<br>
pressure and controlled flow action subjects the fluid to conditions of high turbulence and shear.<br>
[0037] The sterilized glucocorticosteroid suspension is then mixed with the sterile water or<br>
sterile excipient solution held within the second vessel 5 via a re-circulation line 11 to form a<br>
diluted sterilized glucocorticosteroid suspension, as shown in Fig. 4. Typically the<br><br>
glucocorticosteroid suspension is diluted with the sterile water or sterile excipient liquid to a<br>
pharmaceutically suitable concentration. Preferably re-circulation is performed for about 45<br>
mins. The diluted glucocorticosteroid suspension is held within second vessel 5 until required<br>
for filling. During the hold of the suspension it is continually circulated via re-circulation line<br>
12 between second vessel 5 and BFS machine 13 to maintain the active material in suspension,<br>
as shown in Fig. 5. BFS machines are well known in the art and are exemplified by Rommelag<br>
Blow Fill Seal 3012, 305 and 4010 machines and Weiler Engineering ASEP-TECH Blow Fill<br>
Seal 624,628 and 640 machines.<br>
[0038]	Prior to filling, BFS machine 13 is sterilized, e.g. by steam at temperatures of about<br>
122°C to about 138°C for not less than 30 mins. The BFS machine 13 may use any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable primary container material. Typically low-density polyethylene<br>
granulate is used to form the primary container/closure system on the BFS machine 13 although<br>
high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, poly vinyl chloride or polyethylene terephthalate may<br>
also be used. Mixtures of these materials may also be used. The BFS machine 13 is configured<br>
to present open topped units to the filling head for each machine filling cycle. The sterile<br>
glucocorticosteroid suspension is filled into the formed units through a time/pressure/dosing unit<br>
which delivers a precise measure of the suspension via filling needles. Following filling the<br>
filling needles are withdrawn and the head section of the mould closes to seal the units<br>
completely. The filled units are then removed from the BFS machine 13.<br>
[0039]	To be "sterile" means that a product or composition meets the criteria of sterility<br>
according to the US Pharmacopoeia 27/NF22,2004, or its counterpart in other jurisdictions, and<br>
which provides a therapeutically acceptable glucocorticosteroid and/or pharmaceutical<br>
formulation.<br>
[0040]	The term "about" is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly,<br>
or around. When the term "about" is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies<br>
that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In<br>
general, the term "about" is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated<br>
value by a variance of 20%.<br>
[0041] As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to<br>
convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within<br>
that range. Thus, for a variable that is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any<br>
integer value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a<br><br>
variable, which is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value of the<br>
numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, a variable which is<br>
described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0,1 or 2 for variables which are inherently<br>
discrete, and can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real value for variables which are<br>

[0042]	The methods and compositions of the present invention are intended for use with<br>
any mammal that may experience the benefits of the methods of the invention. Foremost among<br>
such mammals are humans, although the invention is not intended to be so limited, and is<br>
applicable to veterinary uses. Thus, in accordance with the invention, "mammals" or "mammal<br>
in need" include humans as well as non-human mammals, particularly domesticated animals<br>
including, without limitation, cats, dogs, and horses.<br>
[0043]	Another aspect of the invention provides suspension compositions of sterilized<br>
glucocorticosteroids prepared according to the methods of the first aspect of the invention<br>
described above. In some embodiments, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
treating or alleviating the symptoms of allergic and/or inflammatory conditions in a mammalian<br>
patient. In these embodiments, the compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
sterilized, labile glucocorticosteroid(s) in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.<br>
[0044]	The term "therapeutically effective amount" is used to denote treatments at dosages<br>
effective to achieve the therapeutic result sought. Furthermore, one of skill will appreciate that<br>
the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention may be lowered or<br>
increased by fine tuning and/or by administering more than one compound of the invention, or<br>
by administering a compound of the invention with another compound. The invention therefore<br>
provides a method to tailor the administration/treatment to the particular exigencies specific to a<br>
given mammal.	<br>
[0045]	Other embodiments contemplate compositions presenting the glucocorticosteroid in<br>
combination with a second active ingredient. In some embodiments, the second active<br>
ingredient may be selected from albuterol, ipratropium bromide, cromolyn, formoterol,<br>
tiotropiurn, oxitropium and azelastine.<br>
[0046] In yet other embodiments of this aspect, the compositions of the invention are<br>
formulated to be suitable for oral, inhalation, rectal, ophthalmic (including intravitreal or<br>
intracameral), nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, or parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, and intratracheal) administration.<br><br>
Preferably the composition is formulated for inhalation in which case the particle size of the<br>
glucocorticosteroid is preferably such that the Dv100 is less than 20 urn, the Dv90 is less than 10<br>
urn and the Dv50 is less than 5 µm, where Dvn represents the volume diameter at the nth<br>
percentile. The volume diameter is a known term in the art and indicates the diameter that a<br>
sphere would have when it has the volume of the particle. The particle sizes may be measured<br>
by standard techniques, such as by laser diffraction as described in the examples hereinbelow.<br>
Such a particle sizes may be achieved using the heat sterilisation conditions as described herein.<br>
[0047]	The formulations of the compositions of the invention may conveniently be<br>
presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by conventional pharmaceutical techniques.<br>
Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the compounds of the invention<br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s), such as a diluent or an excipient In general, the<br>
compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active<br>
ingredient with liquid or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the<br>
product.<br>
[0048]	The sterile glucocorticosteroids prepared according to the invention are optionally<br>
formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle with any of the well known<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including diluents and excipients (see Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences. 18th Ed., Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 1990 and<br>
Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1995). The<br>
type of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier/vehicle employed in generating the compositions of<br>
this aspect of the invention will vary depending upon the mode of administration of the<br>
composition to the mammal. Generally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are<br>
physiologically inert and non-toxic. Formulations of compositions according to the invention<br>
may contain more than one type of pharmacologically active ingredient useful for the treatment<br>
of the symptom/condition being treated.<br>
[0049] In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for using compositions of the<br>
invention for treating or alleviating the symptoms of allergic and/or inflammatory conditions in<br>
a mammalian patient. Such methods comprise the administration of a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the labile glucocorticosteroid in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In various<br>
embodiments of this aspect, administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the<br>
glucocorticosteroid, either alone or in combination with a second active agent, is by oral,<br>
inhalation, rectal, ophthalmic, vaginal, or parenteral administration. In some embodiments, the<br><br>
glucocorticosteroid is budesonide while in yet other embodiments the glucocorticbsteroid is<br>
beclomethasone.<br>
[0050]	The invention further provides a sterile glucocorticosteroid, preferably an anti-<br>
inflammatory glucocorticosteroid, for use in the treatment of allergic and/or inflammatory<br>
conditions. The allergic and/or inflammatory conditions to be treated need not be confined to<br>
one anatomic site, for example, the nose or lungs, and the compositions of the invention are<br>
formulated for administration appropriate to the site of treatment. Allergic and/or inflammatory<br>
conditions include, without limitation, contact dermatitis, asthma, rhinitis, or chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disease. The invention also provides for the use of sterile glucocorticosteroid<br>
compositions, in the manufacture of a medicament (preferably a sterile medicament) for use in<br>
the treatment of allergic and/or inflammatory conditions.<br>
[0051]	The following examples are intended to illustrate further certain embodiments of<br>
the invention and are not limiting in nature. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to .<br>
ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific<br>
