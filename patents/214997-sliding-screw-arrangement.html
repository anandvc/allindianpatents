				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sliding screw arrangement, e. g., applicable in a tuner arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Radio base filters for filtering and combining of a number of sender units to one antenna cable are<br>
conventionally built up of various units, e. g. a cavity, a resonator, and one or more support units. The<br>
frequency range of such a filter is mainly determined by the dielectric properties of the resonator while<br>
the fine-adjustment of the filter frequency is achieved by means of adjusting the position of a tuner unit of<br>
an appropriate shape and consisting of a dielectric material in relation to said resonator unit. Commonly,<br>
this is achieved by means of inserting the tuner to a certain degree into a hollowness of the resonator. The<br>
tuning unit comprises, e. g. , a ceramic tuner and a fastening means, e. g. a screw nut, that is movably<br>
arranged along a threaded axis in order to perform the movements of the tuner relative to the resonator,<br>
The threaded axis is driven by a motor unit whereby the screw nut transforms the radial movement of the<br>
threaded axis into a linear movement of the screw nut and the tuner.<br>
For frequency tuning, e. g. , in a radio base station, it is crucial to achieve a high precision for such<br>
frequency adjustments. This implies that the tolerances for undesired variations of the tuner position must<br>
be as small as possible. Preferably, a sliding screw or a similar arrangement is used.<br>
US2002150335 teaches a fine-tuning assembly for an optical grating provided in an optical fiber<br>
comprising a hollow structure for mounting the optical fiber; a sliding member in the said hollow<br>
structure having a slanted passage extending therethrough at an angle with a transversal direction for<br>
finely adjusting the tension in the optical fiber and fine-tuning the optical grating.<br>
US5039966 teaches a temperature-compensated cavity filter comprising a metallic case and a tuning<br>
screw to compensates for temperature-induced changes in the cavity filter.<br>
GB1520420 describes tuner assemblies for microwave circuits. The tuner screw engages a threaded<br>
member and supports a tuning member operative in the cavity and is supported in a mounting.<br>
In none of the above described prior art such construction of the hollow chamber with two<br>
resilient parts and semi-sphere as in the present invention is not found.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A problem of screw arrangements according to the state of<br>
the art, e.g. when fastening a tuner unit, is the<br>
insufficient precision of position adjustments of the<br>
sliding screw along an axis of displacement.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to achieve a<br>
sliding screw arrangement for transformation of the<br>
rotational movement of a threaded axis into a linear<br>
movement of the sliding screw providing minimised tolerances<br>
for variations of the tuner position in both radial and<br>
axial direction.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to achieve a<br>
minimised friction when moving the sliding screw arrangement<br>
along the threaded axis.<br>
These objects are achieved by means of the screw arrangement,<br>
according to the present invention comprising a first<br>
resilient part, e.g. a spring, to compensate tolerances in<br>
axial direction and a second resilient part, e.g. a<br>
resilient tongue, and tracks to compensate tolerances in<br>
radial direction. The screw arrangement comprises a<br>
hollowness through which the threaded axis is guided and<br>
which at its inside is equipped with semi-spheres that<br>
follow the turn of a thread of the axis.<br>
It is a first advantage of the screw arrangement according<br>
to the present invention that it is possible to achieve high<br>
precision and low tolerances in both axial and radial<br>
direction.<br>
It is another advantage of the present invention that the<br>
screw arrangement provides a low degree of friction due to a<br><br>
small area of touching and due to a lack of revolving<br>
details. No lubrication is necessary.<br>
It is still another advantage of the present invention that<br>
the details of the screw arrangement can be manufactured in<br>
plastic, e.g. by means of casting, which reduces the<br>
electric losses and implies a lower weight.<br>
When applied in a tuning arrangement it is thus an overall<br>
advantage of the present invention that a frequency tuning<br>
can be performed both faster and with a higher precision.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail by help<br>
of preferred embodiments and with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a tuning arrangement 10 including a screw<br>
arrangement 14 according to the present invention. The<br>
figure shows a cavity 12, e.g. applied for frequency tuning<br>
in a radio base station, within which a resonator 16 and a<br>
tuner 15 is arranged. Frequency adjustments are achieved by<br>
means of varying the vertical position of the tuner 15 in<br>
relation to the resonator 16. A motor unit 11 drives a<br>
threaded motor axis 13 on which the screw arrangement 14<br>
according to the present invention is mounted. The screw<br>
arrangement 14 consists of a first screw part 141 and a<br>
second screw part 142 that are connected to each other and<br>
comprising a resilience, e.g. a spring 143, between them.<br>
This arrangement is responsible for converting the<br>
rotational movement of the motor axis 13 into a linear<br>
movement of the object, e.g. the tuner, that is fastened at<br>
the"screw arrangement. In order to achieve a high precision<br>
for frequency adjustments, i.e. a high precision for<br>
variations of the tuner position, the screw arrangement 14<br>
according to the present invention must provide both a low<br>
friction between the surfaces of the screw and the threaded<br>
axis and low tolerances in both axial and radial direction<br>
in response to the rotational movements of the motor axis<br>
13. The arrangement 14 comprises at its one end fastening<br>
means, e.g. a threaded part, for fastening of the tuner 18.<br>
The screw arrangement according to the present invention<br>
consists of two parts, which are shown in perspective views<br>
in figures 2a and 3a. Each of said parts 20,30 comprises a<br>
hollowness 22,32 through which the motor axis 13 of the<br>
cavity is protruded and which at its inside is equipped with<br>
one, preferably several, semi-spheres 21,31 that are<br>
arranged around the inside of said hollowness. The sliding<br>
properties of the screw can be influenced by the arrangement<br>
of said semi-spheres, their number and form. The semi-<br>
spheres are arranged to follow the threads of the axis 13 on<br><br>
which the screw arrangement is mounted. Preferably, the<br>
semi-spheres follow one turn, or a multiple of turns, of the<br>
threaded axis 13. However, it is nevertheless a conceivable<br>
alternative that the semi-spheres are arranged to follow<br>
only a part of one turn of the threaded axis or that there<br>
is only one single semi-sphere. For a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention it has turned out to be appropriate<br>
to apply at least three semi-spheres and, typically, six<br>
semi-spheres that follow one turn of the threaded axis and<br>
secure by that means a sufficient steering of the screw part<br>
along said axis. As explained later in more detail, the<br>
first and second screw part are mounted together comprising<br>
a certain resilience between them, which causes a force that<br>
presses the semi-spheres to opposite parts of the threaded<br>
axis. Therefore, the cross-section of the semi-spheres is<br>
preferably designed in such a way that there is a small-<br>
touching surface between semi-spheres and threads in order<br>
to achieve a low friction while said touching surface at the<br>
same rime must be sufficiently large to stand pressures when<br>
moving the screw arrangement including, e.g. a tuner object,<br>
along the threaded axis. This can be achieved, e.g., by<br>
means of a spherical cross section as indicated in figures<br>
2b and 3b. In order to minimise tolerances due to a bending<br>
of the first and second screw part when mounted together,<br>
the sections of semi-spheres for each screw part are<br>
preferably separated from each other as far as possible.<br>
The figures 2a-2c and 3a-3c relate to a screw arrangement<br>
consisting of two parts that can be inserted into each<br>
other. The first screw part 20, which is shown in figures 2a<br>
and 2b, is built up of a screw hat 23 and, according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, of a portion<br>
2 4 having a cylindrical or another appropriate form. The<br>
screw hat 23 and the cylindrical portion comprises a<br>
diameter that is sufficiently large to allow said first<br>
screw part to be screwed on a threaded axis along which the<br><br>
screw arrangement shall be moved. In order to achieve a<br>
secure fastening of the first and second screw part and in<br>
order to eliminate the radial allowance of the screw<br>
arrangement the first screw part comprises at least one<br>
resilient tongue 25 that is fastened at the screw hat 23 and<br>
arranged in parallel to the cylindrical portion 24 such that<br>
there is a narrow slot 26 between said resilient tongue 25<br>
and the cylindrical portion 24. The resilient tongue 24 is,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, at its end equipped with a bulge 27 that is<br>
directed towards the cylindrical portion 24. When the first<br>
and second screw part are mounted together, i.e. the<br>
cylindrical portion 24 is inserted into a corresponding<br>
opening of the second screw part 30, the outer edge 35 of<br>
the second screw part 30 can be inserted within said narrow<br>
slot 26. On that occasion the tongue 25 is guided along a<br>
track 36 of the second screw part 30 such that the bulge 27<br>
can snap in a corresponding opening 37 of the second screw<br>
part 30 to provide a firm connection of both screw parts.<br>
The outside of the cylindrical portion 24 of the first screw<br>
part comprises one or more protrusions 28 that are arranged<br>
in a longitudinal direction along the cylindrical portion 24<br>
in order to facilitate a correct mounting of the cylindrical<br>
portion of the first screw part into corresponding grooves<br>
34 of the second screw part and in order to eliminate radial<br>
tolerances of said screw arrangement. This protrusions can<br>
have a spherical form or another appropriate form, e.g. a V-<br>
form.<br>
The first and second screw part must be connected to each<br>
other in such a way that there is a certain resilience<br>
between them in order to eliminate the axial allowance. This<br>
resilience can be realised, e.g., by means of a resilient<br>
portion that is an integrated part of the first screw part<br>
20 where the lower part of the cylindrical portion 24 is<br>
designed as a spring. In another embodiment the resilience<br><br>
is realised by means of a separate spring element 143 that<br>
is inserted within the hollowness 32 of the second screw<br>
part 30 such that its one end rests on a projection 33<br>
within said hollowness while the other end lies on the lower<br>
edge of the cylindrical portion 24 of the first screw part<br>
20. This spring element 143 is pressed together when the<br>
screw is mounted on the threaded motor axis 13 and exerts<br>
thus a force in a direction that presses the screw parts<br>
20,30 away from each other. By that the semi-spheres 21,31<br>
of each of the screw parts 20,30 are pressed to opposite<br>
sides of the threads of the threaded axis 13, which implies<br>
a secured position of the screw arrangement in axial<br>
direction that eliminates axial tolerances.<br>
The first screw part 20 according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, as shown in figure 2a<br>
and 2b, is designed to be inserted into the second screw<br>
part 30. Another conceivable design could be a first screw<br>
part 20 that only consists of a screw hat 23 or comprising a<br>
cylindrical portion 24 of significantly reduced length. Such<br>
an embodiment comprises preferably more than one resilient<br>
tongue 25 as the first and second screw parts are connected<br>
to each other only by help of said tongues in a way as<br>
described above.<br>
The second screw part 30, which is shown in figures 3a-3c,<br>
comprises a hollowness 32 having a diameter that corresponds<br>
to the diameter of the cylindrical portion 24 of the first<br>
screw part 20 when assuming an embodiment where the first<br>
screw part 20 is inserted into the second screw part 30. If<br>
said, first screw part 20 is equipped with protrusions 28<br>
along its cylindrical portion 24 as described above the<br>
second screw part 30 must comprise grooves 34 of a<br>
corresponding form such that said protrusions 28 can be<br>
guided on said grooves 34 and thus allow a secure mounting<br>
of the screw parts 20,30 and prevent radial allowance. The<br>
second screw part 30 comprises at its one end a fastening<br>
means., preferably a screw threading, to fasten an object,<br>
e.g. a tuner, that shall be moved along the threaded axis<br>
13.<br>
An appropriate material for the screw arrangement according<br>
to the present invention is selected with respect to its<br>
electrical and mechanical properties. The material must<br>
comprise low electric losses when the screw arrangement is<br>
located, e.g., inside the tuner cavity, which implies that<br>
the screw can influence the electromagnetic field within the<br>
cavity. Regarding the mechanical properties, the screw must<br>
consist of a material having a low friction and a good<br>
sliding surface. An example of a conceivable material<br>
comprising low electric losses is polyeterimid, preferably<br>
comprising a certain concentration of teflon. Another<br>
material, which is conceivable for less demands on electric<br>
losses, is acetalplastics with a certain concentration of<br>
teflon.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the embodiments that have<br>
been described above and have been shown in the drawings but<br>
can be modified within the scope of the accompanying claims.<br><br>
