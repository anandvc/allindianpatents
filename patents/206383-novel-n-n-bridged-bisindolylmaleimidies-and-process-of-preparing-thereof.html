				<td>Field of the Invention<br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a intermediates and the process for preparation thereof.<br><br>
novel<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The ubiquitous nature of the protein kinase C isozymes and their important roles in physiology provide incentives to produce highly selective PKC inhibitors.  Given the evidence demonstrating linkage of certain isozymes to disease states, it is reasonable to assume that inhibitory compounds that are selective to one or two protein kinase C isozymes relative to the other PKC isozymes and other protein kinases are superior therapeutic agents.  Such compounds demonstrate greater efficacy and lower toxicity by virtue of their specificity.<br>
A class of PKC isozyme selective N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides have been disclosed in Heath et al., (EP 0 657 458), published on June 14, 1995.  A preferred compound in this N,N'-bridged series includes a compound of the Formula I:<br><br>
R      (I)<br>
wherein R is an amino, alkylamino, or dialkylamino.  Heath et al. exemplify a number of these amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides as being prepared as follows:<br><br>
-2-<br><br>
Unfortunately, the O-mesylate functionality used to prepare amino substituted N,N' -bridged bisindolylmalimides has been found to be toxic and an undesired impurity in the preparation of amino substituted N.N'-bridged<br>
bisindolylmaleimides.  Expensive purification techniques must be employed to ensure that the O-mesylate intermediate is removed from the final product.<br>

The data in Table I demonstrate that the tosyl, bromide and iodide are unexpectedly reactive -- particularly the bromide and iodide which are from 8x to 36x more reactive, than the known mesylate intermediate.  This enhanced reactivity relative to MsO was also observed with H2NCH3, H2N(benzyl). The increase in reactivity results in a lower temperature reaction that is complete in a shorter period of time.  The use of the claimed intermediate also results in fewer impurities in the product.  Using the known O-Mesyl intermediate, the reaction to produce an amino substituted N,N-bisindolylmaleimide results in an impurity level from 15 to 30 % due to by-products formed from reaction at the maleimide carbonyl group.  Using the claimed intermediate, the impurity level is less than 5 %, a substantial improvement.<br>
As previously stated, the O-mesylate functionality used to prepare amino substituted N,N' bridged bis-indolylmalimides has been found to be toxic and an undesired impurity in the preparation of amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides.  Expensive purification techniques must be employed to ensure that the O-mesylate intermediate is removed from the final product.  Therefore, an additional advantage of the present intermediates and process for preparing amino substituted N,N' bridged bis-indolylmalimides using the claimed intermediates is avoiding difficult purification steps to remove toxic impurities.<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a key intermediate in the synthesis of amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides.  This novel intermediate is readily converted to an amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides without passing through the OMesylate intermediate.  The intermediate is also dramatically more reactive. The intermediate is preferably used to prepare araino substituted N,N' -bridged bisindolylmaleimides at lower temperatures and in a shorter reaction time resulting in a higher yield with fewer by-products. Thus, the intermediate is useful in preparing N,N'rbridged bisindolylmaleiroides in high yield without undesired toxic impurities.,<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a compound of Formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R1 is Br,  I, or O-tosyl.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing an amino substituted N, N1-bridged bisindolylmaleimide, of Formula (IV) :<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a compound of the<br>
Formula II:<br><br>
R1     (ID wherein R1 is Br, I, or O-tosyl.<br>
The present invention further provides a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula II and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.<br>
One further aspect of the invention is a process of using the compound of Formula II to prepare amino substituted N,N' -bridged bisindolylmaleimides of the Formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of the Formula II with an amine in a non-reactive, polar solvent.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, as disclosed and claimed herein, the following terms and abbreviations are defined as follows.<br>
The term "C1-C4 alkyl" represents a cyclo, straight or branched chain alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and the like.<br>
The term "aryl" represents a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl, phenyl, or naphthyl.<br>
The term "amine" as used herein refers to -N(CF3)CH3), -NH(CF3), or -NR3R4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, or combine to the nitrogen to which they are bonded to form a saturated or unsaturated 5 or 6 member ring.<br>
-5<br><br><br>
As noted above, the invention provides a compound of the Formula II:<br><br>
R1     (II) wherein R1 is Br, I, or O-tosyl.<br>
It is recognized that various stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula II may exist.  The preferred compounds of the present invention are of the Formula Ila and lib:<br><br>
- 6-<br><br>
However, racemates and individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are most readily prepared from a compound of the formula:<br><br>
(III)<br>
This hydroxy substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimide, compound III, is prepared by techniques described in Heath et al., (EP 0 657 458), published on June 14, 1995, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The claimed compounds are prepared as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>
(III)	(II)<br>
Rl is the same as previously defined.  Preferably, R1 is Br or I, most preferably R1 is Br.   The claimed tosylate (p-toluenesulfonyl) compounds are prepared by reacting the alcohol with p-toluenesulfonic anhydride in the presence of a base such as pyridine in THF, ether, methylene chloride, or other non-reactive organic solvent.  The reaction is<br>
-7-<br><br>
generally carried out under nitrogen from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
The claimed halides are prepared by reacting the alcohol with a bromide or iodide source.  The bromide or iodide source can be a number of reagents appreciated in the art including: HI, HBr, LiBr, CaBr2, PBr3, R5PBr2, N-bromosuccinimide, CBr4, allyl-Br, Benzyl-Br, SOBr2; wherein R5 is phenyl, phenyloxy, alkyl or aryl.  One skilled in the art would recognize that various activating agents such as 1,1'- carbonyldiimidazole may be added to the reaction.  The conversion of a hydroxy (III) to a halide (II) can be carried out by techniques appreciated in the art and disclosed in Richard C. Larock, A GUIDE TO FUNCTIONAL GROUP PREPARATIONS, VCH Publishers, p. 356-63 (1989), herein incorporated by reference.  Preferred conditions include the bromide or iodide in the presence of a phosphorous halide reagent such as PX3, (phenyl)3PX2, or (phenoxy)3PX2 wherein X is bromo or iodo.  The reaction is suitably carried out in THF, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, or other non-reactive solvents appreciated in the art.  DMF or other solvents are also operative due to formation of an Vilsmeier-type reagentas described in Barluenga J. Synthesis p. 426 (1985) and Hodosi G, Carbohydrate Research 230:327-42 (1992) .<br>
Compounds of the Formula II are converted to the amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides of the Formula IV, as follows:<br><br><br><br>

(IV)<br>
wherein R1 is Br, I, or O-tosyl; and R2 is -N(CF3)CH3), -NH(CF3), or -NR3R4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently<br>

hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, or combine to the nitrogen to which they are bonded to form a saturated or unsaturated 5 or 6 member ring.  Preferably, R2 in N(CH3).<br>
The process of using Compound II to form Compound IV, comprises reacting a compound II with an amine of the formula: HN(CF3)CH3), HNH(CF3), or HNR3R4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, or combine to the nitrogen to which they are bonded to form a saturated or unsaturated 5 or 6 member ring, in a non-reactive, polar aprotic solvent.  The reaction is preferably carried out in a solution of DMF, THF:water, or dimetylacetamide at temperatures ranging from 0°C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.  The reaction generally is complete in about 1 to 20 hours.  Preferably, the reaction is carried out at room temperature to 50°C. Compound IV may be purified from the reaction mixture using standard techniques but is preferably crystallized directly from the reaction mixture.<br>
Most unexpectedly, the use of the claimed intermediate to prepare a amino-substituted<br>
N,N'-bisindolylmaleimide results in a higher yield and avoids toxic impurities.  The claimed intermediate is surprisingly more reactive than the known mesylate intermediate.  The reactivity of various leaving groups to HN(CH3)2 is presented in Table I.  The relative-reactivity predicted in the art is described in CAREY AND SUNDBERG, Part A, 3rd Edition, page 291 (1990).<br><br>
-9-<br><br><br>
The data in Table I demonstrate that the tosyl, bromide and iodide are unexpectedly reactive -- particularly the bromide and iodide which are from 8x to 3 6x more reactive than the known mesylate intermediate.  This enhanced reactivity relative to MsO was also observed with H2NCH3, H2N(benzyl). The increase in reactivity results in a lower temperature reaction that is complete in a shorter period of time.  The use of the claimed intermediate also results in fewer impurities in the product.  Using the known O-Mesyl intermediate, the reaction to produce an amino substituted N,N'-bisindolylmaleimide results in an impurity level from 15 to 30 % due to by-products formed from reaction at the maleimide carbonyl group.  Using the claimed intermediate, the impurity level is less than 5 %, a substantial improvement.<br>
As previously stated, the O-mesylate functionality used to prepare amino substituted N,N' bridged bis-indolylmalimides has been found to be toxic and an undesired impurity in the preparation of amino substituted N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides.  Expensive purification techniques must be employed to ensure that the O-mesylate intermediate is removed from the final product.  Therefore, an additional advantage of the present intermediates and process for preparing amino substituted N,N' bridged bis-indolylmalimides<br>
to<br><br>
using the claimed intermediates is avoiding difficult purification steps to remove toxic impurities.<br>
The preferred compounds prepared using the claimed intermediates are the following:  (S)-13-<br>
[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-lH,13H-dibenzo[E,K]pyrrolo-[3,4-H][1,4,13]oxadiaza-cyclohexadecine-1,3(2H)-dione, particularly as the mesylate salt; (S)-13-[(Monomethylamino)methyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-lH,13H-dibenzo[E,K]pyrrolo-[3,4-H][1,4,13]oxadiaza-cyclohexadecine-l,3(2H)-dione; (S)-13-[(pyrrolidino)methyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-lH,13H-dibenzo[E,K]pyrrolo-[3,4-H][1,4,13]oxadiaza-cyclohexadecine-1,3(2H)-dione monohydrochloride; and (S)-13-[benzylaminomethyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-lH,13H-dibenzo[E,K]pyrrolo-[3,4-H][1,4,13]oxadiaza-cyclohexadecine-1,3(2H)-dione.<br>
The preferred mono-substituted amines of the Formula IV may be prepared directly from the claimed compounds.  A high yielding direct method to prepare these compounds is not possible with the mesylate intermediate.<br>
The compounds of the Formula IV are prepared as the free base and are preferably converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by techniques appreciated in the art. Preferred salts include the hydrochloride and mesylate salt.<br>
