This application is divided out of the Indian Patent Application no.: 1793/KOLNP/2004<br>
Related Application<br>
 The present application claims priority from UK patent<br>
application No. 0214360.0 filed 21 June 2002 and UK patent<br>
application No. 0311191.1 filed 15 May 2003, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
i<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an actuation indicator for<br>
a dispensing device, e.g. a fluid dispensing device or<br>
pressurised fluid dispensing device, such as a pressurised<br>
metered dose inhaler (hereinafter referred to as a "pMDI"),<br>
and components of such an actuation indicator.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
"pMDIs" are well known in the art of inhalation devices. It<br>
is therefore not necessary to describe the construction and<br>
operation of a pMDI other than in bare essentials.<br>
A pMDI comprises an aerosol canister and a tubular actuator.<br>
The aerosol canister comprises a pressurised can, typically<br>
made from a metal, such as aluminium. Inside the can there<br>
is contained the pressurised medicinal aerosol formulation.<br>
The can is sealingly capped by a metering valve assembly at<br>
what will hereinafter be referred to as the "outlet end" of<br>
the aerosol canister. The valve assembly includes a hollow<br><br>
dispensing member or valve stem which projects from the<br>
outlet end of the aerosol canister. The dispensing member is<br>
mounted for sliding movement relative to the aerosol<br>
canister between an extended position, to which the dispensing member is biased by a biasing mechanism in the<br>
valve assembly, and a depressed position.<br>
Movement of the dispensing member from the extended position<br>
to the depressed position results in a metered dose of the aerosol formulation being dispensed from the canister<br>
through the dispensing member.<br>
The tubular actuator comprises an internal passageway having<br>
an open end. The aerosol canister is slidable into the<br>
internal passageway through the open end with the outlet end<br>
being inserted first into the internal passageway.<br>
The actuator has a stand or stem block which receives the<br>
dispensing member of the aerosol canister when the aerosol<br>
canister is received in the actuator in a "rest position".<br>
The stand has a passageway with an inlet end for receiving<br>
the dispensing member and an outlet end which faces a<br>
mouthpiece of the actuator. The stand holds the dispensing<br>
member stationary in the actuator whereby depression of the<br>
aerosol canister from its rest position farther into the<br>
actuator to an "actuated position" causes the dispensing<br>
member to be displaced from the extended position to the<br>
depressed position relative to the canister. A metered dose<br>
of the aerosol formulation will thereby be dispensed out of<br>
the mouthpiece of the actuator via the internal passageway<br>
of the stand.<br><br>
In use, a patient in need of a metered dose of the medicinal<br>
aerosol formulation places their lips on the mouthpiece of<br>
the actuator and then concurrently inhales and depresses the<br>
aerosol canister from the rest position to the actuated<br>
position. The inspiratory airflow produced by the patient<br>
entrains the medicinal component of the aerosol into the<br>
patient's respiratory tract.<br>
Instead of a mouthpiece, there could be provided a nozzle<br>
for nasal use.<br>
Developments to these pMDIs have included the provision of<br>
actuation indicators therefor, for instance dose counters<br>
which are either incremented on each actuation of the pMDI<br>
to display a running total of the number of doses dispensed<br>
from the pMDI or decremented on each actuation to display<br>
the number of doses left in the dispenser. See, for example,<br>
W096/16686, US-A-4817822 and US5482030.<br>
A recently developed dose counter is described in PCT Patent<br>
Application No. W098/56444, to Glaxo Group Limited, the<br>
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by way of<br>
reference. The dose counter is fixably secured on the outlet<br>
end of the aerosol canister and includes a display which<br>
denotes the number of metered doses of the medicament<br>
formulation left in the aerosol canister. The display of the<br>
dose counter is visible to the patient through a window<br>
provided in the actuator. The display is presented by a<br>
plurality of indicator wheels rotatably mounted on a common<br>
axle, each wheel having numerals from '0' to '9' displayed<br>
in series around the circumference.<br><br>
Before the dose counter is mounted on the aerosol canister,<br>
the display wheels are arranged so that the display shows<br>
the claimed total number of doses available in the aerosol<br>
canister, the so-called "label claim". Upon each actuation,<br>
an indexing mechanism in the dose counter comprising a star<br>
wheel, a driver yoke and a rack operates to decrement the<br>
number displayed by the display by rotation of one or more<br>
of the indicator wheels.<br>
When the aerosol canister with attached dose counter is in a<br>
rest position in the actuator, the rack, which is formed in<br>
the actuator, protrudes into the dose counter. When the<br>
aerosol canister is moved from the rest position to the<br>
actuated position, this results in relative movement between<br>
the dose counter and the rack. During this relative<br>
movement, the rack engages the yoke of the indexing<br>
mechanism to cause it to operate to decrement the number<br>
displayed by the display by turning the star wheel.<br>
The index mechanism of the mechanical dose counter known<br>
from W098/56444 includes a lost motion coupling to<br>
compensate for overtravel of the dose counter relative to<br>
the rack as the aerosol canister reciprocates between the<br>
rest position and the actuated position in the actuator.<br>
A device and method for attaching a dose counter to an<br>
aerosol canister is disclosed in PCT application publication<br>
W001/28887, also to Glaxo Group Limited, the entire contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by way of reference. The<br>
dose counter is fixedly secured to the outlet end of the<br>
aerosol canister through a split-ring collar. More<br>
particularly, a skirt portion of the dose counter housing<br><br>
surrounds a neck on the can of the aerosol canister, and the<br>
split-ring collar is wedged in-between the skirt and a re-<br>
entrant surface of the neck and then ultrasonically welded<br>
to the skirt. This effectively provides a permanent<br>
connection between the dose counter and the aerosol canister<br>
to prevent the dose counter from being tampered with.<br>
All these prior art devices, however, require the components<br>
thereof to be manufactured to tight tolerances so that they<br>
correctly function, or they are difficult to assemble.<br>
Accordingly, they are relatively expensive to manufacture.<br>
Further, they are unsuitable for attachment to canisters or<br>
actuators that are made with wide manufacturing tolerances,<br>
as may occur when attempting to reduce the manufacturing<br>
cost of actuators or aerosol canisters.<br>
It would be desirable to provide an actuator and/or dose<br>
counter that is inexpensive to manufacture due to the lack<br>
of the need for tight manufacturing tolerances. It would<br>
also be desirable to provide an actuator and/or dose counter<br>
that is simple and therefore inexpensive to assemble. It<br>
would also be desirable to provide an actuator and/or dose<br>
counter that can be used with more than one size of aerosol<br>
canister. It would also be desirable to provide components<br>
of such devices that allow for wide manufacturing<br>
tolerances.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings.<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a pressurised metered dose inhaler, or pMDI,<br>
1. The pMDI 1 comprises a tubular actuator 3 of a generally<br>
L-shape. The actuator 3 is provided with an open-ended<br>
through passage or internal passageway 5 which extends from<br>
an upper opening or open end 7 to a lower opening (not<br>
shown) in a mouthpiece 9. The actuator further comprises a<br>
viewing window 11.<br>
The pMDI 1 further comprises an aerosol canister unit 15,<br>
which comprises an aerosol canister 17, shown in ghost and<br>
having a standard construction as described in the<br>
'Background of the Invention' section above, and a dose<br>
counter module 19 mounted on the outlet end of the canister<br>
17. The aerosol canister 17 contains a pressurised medicinal<br>
aerosol formulation, for example a therapeutic agent<br>
suspended or dissolved in a liquified gas propellant,<br>
typically a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant, such as HFA-<br>
134a or HFA-227.<br>
As will be understood from the 'Background of the Invention'<br>
section above, the aerosol canister unit 15 is adapted to be<br>
slid into the passageway 5 of the actuator 3 through the<br>
upper opening 7 when the aerosol canister unit 15 is<br><br>
inverted, i.e. with the dose counter module 19 at the<br>
leading end, so that it is inserted first into the actuator<br>
3 .<br>
The aerosol canister unit 15 is slid along the passageway 5<br>
to a rest position in which a dispensing member (not shown)<br>
of the aerosol canister 17, which projects into the dose<br>
counter module 19, engages a stand (not shown) in the<br>
passageway 5 so that the dispensing member is held<br>
stationary in the actuator 3. Further depression of the<br>
aerosol canister unit 15 into the passageway 5 causes the<br>
dispensing member to be depressed into the aerosol canister<br>
17 and a metered dose of the medicinal aerosol formulation<br>
will then be dispensed from the aerosol canister 17. The<br>
dose will thereby be exhausted from the actuator 3 through<br>
the mouthpiece 9.<br>
For correct angular orientation of the aerosol canister unit<br>
15 in the actuator 3, the passageway 5 defines a<br>
longitudinal inner track portion 21 to receive a<br>
complementary protrusion 23 on the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the dose counter module 19. The protrusion<br>
coincides with a display window 25 of the dose counter<br>
module. The window 11 of the actuator 3 is located in the<br>
wall of the longitudinal track portion 21 to ensure that the<br>
display window 25 on the protrusion 23 registers with the<br>
window ll of the actuator 3. A patient can thereby view the<br>
display in the dose counter window 25 when the aerosol<br>
canister unit 15 is mounted in the actuator 3.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2, the dose counter module 19 has<br>
a hollow outer casing 30 made from a plastics material, for<br><br>
example polypropylene (PP) . As shown in FIGURE 2, the outer<br>
casing 30 is formed from a cap part 31 and a sleeve part 33.<br>
The cap part 31 has a plurality of posts 35 which project<br>
upwardly (in inverted orientation) from the periphery of the<br>
cap part 31. They are provided to extend through alignment<br>
holes (not shown) in the sleeve part 33, The posts 35 are<br>
subsequently joined or adhered to an inner surface of the<br>
sleeve part 33, for example by welding, such as ultrasonic<br>
welding. This ensures a permanent connection of the cap<br>
part 31 to the sleeve part 33.<br>
The cap and sleeve parts 31,33 both comprise elements of the<br>
protrusion 23 of the dose counter module 19. The window 25<br>
is retained in a track 39 formed in those elements of the<br>
protrusion 23 when the cap and sleeve parts 31, 33 are mated<br>
together. The window may be made of a transparent plastics<br>
material, for instance polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), such<br>
as PERSPEX (RTM).<br>
As shown in FIGURES 2 to 6, the cap part 31 has a generally<br>
U-shape cross section. When the dose counter module 19 is<br>
mounted to the outlet end of the aerosol canister 17, the<br>
dispensing member (not shown) of the aerosol canister 17 is<br>
received in the concave cut-out 41 of the U-shaped cap part<br>
31. Moreover, when the aerosol canister unit 15 is slid into<br>
the actuator 3 to its rest position, the stand is received<br>
in the cut-out 41 for engagement with the dispensing member.<br>
In other words, the cap part 31 of the dose counter module<br>
19 is arranged about the stand. See W098/56444, and in<br>
particular FIGURE 1 thereof, for a fuller disclosure of the<br>
dispensing member and the stand therefor.<br><br>
Turning to FIGURE 2, when the dose counter module 19 is<br>
assembled, it is mounted to the outlet end of the aerosol<br>
canister 17 through a split-ring collar 43, for example made<br>
of PP, which is mounted to the neck on the can of the<br>
aerosol canister 17 and then wedged between the neck and an<br>
inner circumferential surface 45 of the sleeve part 33 of<br>
the outer casing 30 prior to welding it thereto by<br>
ultrasonic welding, as further detailed in<br>
WO-α-0128887, supra.<br>
The outer casing 30 of the dose counter module 19 houses a<br>
mechanical dose counting mechanism, details of which now<br>
follow.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 4, the cap part 31 of the outer casing 30<br>
retains a drums sub-assembly 50 of the counting mechanism.<br>
Referring also to FIGURE 2, the drums sub-assembly 50<br>
comprises an axle spring 51 having an upper axle 53, a lower<br>
axle 55, which extends parallel to the upper axle 53, and a<br>
U-shaped connector section 57 oriented perpendicularly to<br>
the upper and lower axles 53,55. The axle spring 51 is made<br>
from a metal, such as a stainless spring steel. The<br>
connector section 57 operates to bias the upper and lower<br>
axles 53,55 to a closed position, i.e. towards one another.<br>
The drums sub-assembly 50 further comprises a set of three<br>
indicator wheels 59,61,63 which are adapted to be co-axially<br>
mounted on the upper axle 53 for rotation thereon. The<br>
indicator wheels 59,61,63 are formed from a plastics<br>
material, e.g. acetal, ideally by injection moulding. Each<br>
indicator wheel 59,61,63 is provided with a central aperture<br><br>
60,62,64 to enable them to be slid onto the upper axle 53 of<br>
the axle spring 51.<br>
Each indicator wheel 59,61,63 has numbers arranged<br>
circumferentially in order on the rims 65,67,69 of the<br>
wheels 59,61,63, applied for example in the manner disclosed<br>
in International patent application publication WO-α-<br>
0108733, also to Glaxo Group Limited.<br>
The rotational position of each indicator wheel 59,61,63 on<br>
the upper axle 53 determines which number on its rim<br>
65,67,69 is displayed through the window 25 of the dose<br>
counter module 19. The indicator wheels 59,61,63<br>
collectively display a three digit number in the window 25,<br>
which number identifies the number of metered doses of the<br>
medicinal aerosol formulation left in the aerosol canister<br>
17. Thus, at the outset, i.e. before use, the indicator<br>
wheels 59,61,63 are arranged on the upper axle 53 so that<br>
the three digit number displayed in the window 25<br>
corresponds to the label claim of metered doses available in<br>
the aerosol canister 17.<br>
It is convenient to refer to the right-hand indicator wheel<br>
59 (as viewed in e.g. FIGURE 7) as the "units wheel", the<br>
central indicator wheel 61 as the "tens wheel" and the left-<br>
hand indicator wheel 63 as the "hundreds wheel" because the<br>
numbers displayed thereon correspond to the units, tens and<br>
hundreds of the dose count displayed in the window 25.<br>
It will be appreciated that the use of three indicator<br>
wheels 59,61,63 enables the dose counter module 19 to be<br>
used with an aerosol canister which is filled with over one<br><br>
hundred metered doses of a medicinal aerosol formulation. As<br>
will be understood, the number of indicator wheels could be<br>
increased or decreased depending on the number of metered<br>
doses in the aerosol canister 17. For instance, if the<br>
"label claim" was less than a hundred metered doses, it may-<br>
be convenient to use only two indicator wheels. Of course,<br>
three indicator wheels could still be used.<br>
In this embodiment, the units and tens wheels 59,61 each<br>
have the numbers '0' to '9' inclusive equi-angularly-<br>
arranged thereon in series, while the hundreds wheel 63 only<br>
has the numbers '0' to ' 2' inclusive arranged thereon in<br>
series, although with the same inter-number angular spacing<br>
(36°) as for the numbers on the units and tens wheels 59,61.<br>
Of course, the series of numbers on the hundreds wheel 63<br>
can be increased or decreased, depending on the "start<br>
count" desired.<br>
As shown in FIGURES 2 and 5, the units wheel 59 has a<br>
ratchet wheel 71 on its right-hand side which is provided<br>
with teeth 74 on its circumference 73. The ratchet wheel 71<br>
is supported on the end of a shaft 72 (see FIGURES 7 and<br>
14B) . Referring now to FIGURES 7, 14F and 15A, the left-<br>
hand side of the units wheel 59 is provided with a boss 75<br>
provided with just two teeth (a "bunny" tooth 77).<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2, the tens wheel 61 and the hundreds<br>
wheel 63 each have a boss 79,81 on the right-hand side with<br>
a toothed circumference 83,85. FIGURE 7 shows that the<br>
toothed circumferences 83,85 have teeth 87,89 whose tips are<br>
flush with the rims 67,69 of the associated indicator wheel<br>
61,63. As shown in FIGURES 7 and 14F, the tens wheel 61 is<br><br>
further provided with a boss 91 on its left-hand side which<br>
is also provided with a bunny tooth 93 on its outer<br>
circumference 95.<br>
As further shown in FIGURES 7 and 14F, as well as FIGURE 4,<br>
the hundreds wheel 63 has a boss 97 having an outer<br>
circumference 99 provided with a radially protruding segment<br>
101 which lies flush with the rim 69 of the hundreds wheel<br>
63.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, the drums sub-assembly 50 further<br>
comprises a set of two knock gears 103,105 having axial<br>
apertures 107,109 which enable the knock gears 103,105 to be<br>
co-axially mounted on the lower axle 55 of the axle spring<br>
51 for rotation thereon. As shown in FIGURE 7, for example,<br>
each knock gear 103,105 has a toothed wheel portion 111,113,<br>
a disc portion 115,117 arranged parallel to the associated<br>
toothed wheeled portion 111,113, but axially offset<br>
therefrom, and an axially-arranged hollow shaft portion<br>
119,121 which connects the associated toothed wheel and disc<br>
portions 111,113:115,117. The knock gears are made of a<br>
plastics material, e.g. acetal, and are ideally made by<br>
injection moulding.<br>
The disc portions 115,117 of the knock gears 103,105<br>
function to locate the knock gears and indicator wheels<br>
correctly in the cap part 31. In particular, the disc<br>
portions 115,117 inhibit axial play of the indicator wheels<br>
and knock gears on the axle spring 51 by overlapping the<br>
outer surfaces of the units and hundreds wheels 59,63, on<br>
the one hand, and being overlapped by surface features in<br>
the cap part 31 (not shown), on the other hand. So, neither<br><br>
the indicator wheels 59,61,63 nor the knock gears 103,105<br>
can be outwardly axially displaced on the spring axle 51<br>
once located in the outer casing 30.<br>
As further shown in FIGURE 7, the toothed wheeled portions<br>
111,113 of the knock gears 103,105 are divided into two<br>
axial sections, a right-hand side section 123,125 and a<br>
left-hand side section 127,129. The number of teeth<br>
presented by the right-hand side sections 123,125 (4 teeth)<br>
is less than the number of teeth presented by the left-hand<br>
side sections 127,129.<br>
As will be understood from FIGURE 7, when the indicator<br>
wheels 59,61,63 and knock gears 103,105 are mounted on the<br>
upper and lower axles 53,55, respectively, the rims 65,67 of<br>
the units and tens wheels 59,61 are rotatably supported<br>
between adjacent teeth in the right-hand side sections<br>
123,125 of the toothed wheeled portions 111,113 of the knock<br>
gears 103,105. Moreover, the teeth 87,89 on the tens wheel<br>
61 and the hundreds wheel 63 mesh with the teeth of the<br>
left-hand side sections 127,129 of the toothed wheel<br>
portions 111,113 of the knock gears 103,105.<br>
As will be further understood from FIGURE 7, for example,<br>
the inherent biasing force in the axle spring 51 ensures<br>
that the indicator wheels 59,61,63 and knock gears 103,105<br>
are biased towards one another so that the interengagable<br>
circumferential surfaces thereof interengage one another. In<br>
other words, the upper and lower axles 53,55 need to be<br>
parted against the action of the biasing force to<br>
accommodate the indicator wheels 59,61,63 and knock gears<br>
103,105. Thus, in the assembled state of the drums sub-<br><br>
assembly 50, the upper and lower axles 53,55 are spaced<br>
apart by a distance which is greater than their spacing in<br>
the rest or return state of the axle spring 51. Accordingly,<br>
the upper and lower axles 53,55 push the indicator wheels<br>
59,61,63 and knock gears 103,105, respectively, towards one<br>
another. A good connection between the indicator wheels<br>
59,61,63 and knock gears 103,105 therefore results.<br>
Also mountable in the cap part 31 of the outer casing 30 of<br>
the dose counter module 19 is a drive wheel sub-assembly 150<br>
of the counting mechanism. Referring to FIGURE 2 to 6, the<br>
drive wheel sub-assembly 150 comprises a drive wheel 151<br>
having a pinion 153 having an outer circumference 155<br>
defined by a series of teeth 157. The drive wheel 151<br>
further comprises a boss 159 extending axially from the<br>
left-hand side of the pinion 153 (as viewed in e.g. FIGURE<br>
2) . An axial passage or passageway 161 extends through the<br>
pinion 153 and the boss 159.<br>
The drive wheel 151 is a plastics component of the dose<br>
counter module 19, e.g. of acetal, for instance made by<br>
injection moulding. The drive wheel sub-assembly 150 further<br>
comprises a drive wheel support spring 163 made from a<br>
metal, such as stainless steel. The drive wheel support<br>
spring 163 defines an axle section 165 which is insertable<br>
into the axial passageway 161 of the drive wheel 151 for<br>
rotatable support of the drive wheel 151.<br>
The drive wheel sub-assembly 150 yet further comprises a<br>
slipping clutch spring 167, preferably formed from a metal,<br>
such as stainless spring steel. The clutch spring 167 is of<br>
a generally U-shaped configuration having a pair of<br><br>
generally parallel arm sections 169,171 connected by a U-<br>
bend connector section 173. The connector section 173 biases<br>
the arm sections 169,171 to be closed together thereby<br>
enabling the arm sections 169,171 to be clamped onto the<br>
 boss 159 of the drive wheel 151, as shown in FIGURE 9, for<br>
example. More particularly, one of the arm sections 169 of<br>
the clutch spring 167 is formed with a curved portion 175<br>
adjacent its free end which is of complementary size and<br>
shape to the outer circumferential surface 177 of the boss<br>
 159.<br>
Thus, when the drive wheel 151 rotates on the axle section<br>
165 of the drive wheel support spring 163, the clutch spring<br>
rotates therewith. However, if a sufficient force is applied<br>
to the clutch spring 167 which opposes its rotation with the<br>
drive wheel 151, the clutch spring 167 slips on the boss<br>
159. Therefore, the rotation of the drive wheel 151 will<br>
not be transmitted to the slipping clutch spring 167.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows that the dose counting mechanism further<br>
comprises a rotatable plastics pawl 200 (e.g. acetal) having<br>
a pawl arm 201 with a pawl tooth 203 at its tip, a C-shaped<br>
hub 205 shaped to be rotatably mounted on the shaft 72 of<br>
the units wheel 59, and a boss 207 extending axially from<br>
the right-hand side of the rotatable pawl 200 which is<br>
adapted to be slidingly received in the track 174 defined<br>
between the arm sections 169,171 of the clutch spring 167.<br>
The pawl may be injection moulded.<br>
The assembled state of the counting mechanism is shown in<br>
FIGURE 7, and its arrangement in the cap part 31 of the<br>
outer casing 30 of the dose counter module 19 is shown in<br><br>
FIGURES 4-6. The operation of the counting mechanism to show<br>
the number of metered doses of the medicinal aerosol<br>
formulation left will now be described.<br>
When the aerosol canister unit 15 is in its rest position in<br>
the actuator 3, the counting mechanism of the dose counter<br>
module 19 is in the state shown in FIGURES 8, 9 and 10A-B.<br>
More particularly, a rack 13 projecting upwardly from a base<br>
surface of the actuator 3 extends through an aperture 20 in<br>
the cap part 31 of the outer casing 30 of the dose counter<br>
module 19 so that a set of teeth 14 on the rack 13 mesh with<br>
the teeth 157 of the pinion 153 of the drive wheel 151. In<br>
this regard, the drive wheel support spring 163 biases the<br>
drive wheel 151 towards the window 25. The interaction of<br>
the rack 13 with the pinion 153 causes the drive wheel 151<br>
to be displaced against the biasing force of the drive wheel<br>
support spring 163. This results in the pinion teeth 157<br>
being biased against the rack teeth 14 thereby ensuring a<br>
good engagement therebetween.<br>
In the rest position of the aerosol canister unit 15 in the<br>
actuator 3, the rotatable pawl 200 has an angular<br>
orientation relative to the ratchet wheel 71 which results<br>
in the pawl tooth 203 engaging behind one of the ratchet<br>
teeth 74.<br>
If the aerosol canister unit 15 has been previously unused,<br>
the indicator wheels 59,61,63 are arranged on the upper axle<br>
53 of the axle spring 51 so that the numerical indicia<br>
thereon are lined up to show in the window 25 of the<br>
actuator 3 the starting number of metered doses available in<br>
the aerosol canister 17 for dispensing. This starting number<br><br>
corresponds to the number of metered doses stated on the<br>
label of the aerosol canister 17, e.g. the "label claim". As<br>
an example, the starting number of metered doses may be<br>
'160', as indicated in FIGURE 15A. The label claim need not,<br>
however, match the actual number of available doses since an<br>
aerosol canister will usually be overfilled slightly to<br>
allow for losses during storage, for example. This also<br>
provides a reserve of doses for a user once the counter has<br>
reached zero in case of emergencies.<br>
When a patient wishes to dispense a metered dose of the<br>
aerosol formulation, the patient places their lips on the<br>
mouthpiece 9 of the actuator 3 then simultaneously inhales<br>
and depresses the aerosol canister unit 15 into the actuator<br>
3. The start of this downstroke of the aerosol canister unit<br>
15 into the actuator 3 is shown in FIGURES 11A-B. In<br>
comparison FIGURES 10A-B shows the counting mechanism at<br>
rest.<br>
The downstroke causes the dose counter module 19 to move<br>
downwardly in the direction of arrow A relative to the rack<br>
13 of the actuator 3 . This relative movement causes the<br>
teeth 14 of the rack 13 to rotate the drive wheel 151 in the<br>
direction of arrow B through its interaction with the pinion<br>
153. The rotation of the drive wheel 151 causes the clutch<br>
spring 167 mounted on the boss 159 to rotate therewith. This<br>
in turn causes the rotatable pawl 200 to rotate on the shaft<br>
72 of the units wheel 59 in the direction of arrow C, which<br>
direction is opposite to the direction of rotation B of the<br>
drive wheel 151.<br><br>
As will be appreciated from FIGURE 11A, the rotation of the<br>
pawl 200 in the direction of arrow C is caused through the<br>
location of the boss 207 of the pawl 200 in the guide track<br>
174 defined in the clutch spring 167.<br>
As will be further appreciated from FIGURE 11A, the rotation<br>
of the pawl 200 in the direction of arrow C on the units<br>
wheel 59 causes the pawl arm 201 to disengage from behind<br>
the trailing surface of the ratchet tooth 74 it was engaged<br>
with in the rest position, and to slide up the leading flank<br>
surface of the next adjacent ratchet tooth 74.<br>
Continued depression of the aerosol canister unit 15 into<br>
the actuator 3 causes the valve thereof to open, and for a<br>
metered dose of the medicinal aerosol formulation to be<br>
discharged from the mouthpiece 9, generally, in use, into<br>
the respiratory tract of the patient. As shown in FIGURE<br>
12A, the rotation of the pawl 200 on the units wheel 59 is<br>
continued until the pawl tooth 203 drops behind the trailing<br>
flank surface of the next adjacent ratchet tooth 74. From<br>
this it will be appreciated that the pawl arm 201 is a<br>
resilient arm whereby the pawl tooth 203 at the free end<br>
thereof falls from the tip of one ratchet tooth 74 to the<br>
leading flank surface of the next adjacent ratchet tooth<br>
during the downstroke.<br>
The rotation of the pawl 200 on the units drum 59 is not<br>
transmitted thereto due to a fixed pawl or resilient non-<br>
return leg 18 in the cap part 31 of the outer casing 30 of<br>
the dose counter module 19 engaging behind the trailing<br>
flank surface of one of the ratchet teeth 74 of the ratchet<br>
wheel 71 of the units wheel 59.<br><br>
Comparison of FIGURE 12A to FIGURE 11A shows that the<br>
rotation of the pinion 153 of the drive wheel 151 is able to<br>
be translated into counter-rotation of the pawl 200 on the<br>
units wheel 59 through the ability of the boss 207 of the<br>
pawl 200 to slide in the guide track 174 defined in the<br>
clutch spring 1S7. In other words, there is a "toggle link"-<br>
type coupling between the drive wheel 151 and the pawl 200.<br>
 As further shown in FIGURE 12A, when the rack 13 causes the<br>
pinion 153 to rotate the drive wheel 151 a predetermined<br>
angle, the pawl 200 abuts with an end stop 221 which extends<br>
downwardly from the sleeve part 33 of the outer casing 30 of<br>
the dose counter module 19. This prevents the pawl 200 over-<br>
rotating on the units wheel 59 and the pawl tooth 203 being<br>
indexed over more than one ratchet tooth 74 on the<br>
downstroke of the aerosol canister unit 15. Once the pawl<br>
200 bears against the end stop 221, continued depression of<br>
the aerosol canister unit 15 into the actuator 3 (e.g. to<br>
open the valve) is accommodated by the clutch spring 167<br>
slipping on the boss 159 of the drive wheel 151 (as a result<br>
of the clutch spring 167 only being retained thereon by<br>
friction forces) . That is to say, the drive wheel 151 is<br>
free to continue rotating once the pawl 200 abuts with the<br>
end stop 221 without this rotation being transmitted to the<br>
pawl 200 due to the drive wheel 151 rotating relative to the<br>
clutch spring 167, i.e. there is a lost motion coupling.<br>
Once the aerosol canister unit 15 has been depressed to the<br>
bottom of its downstroke, and a metered dose of the<br>
medicinal aerosol formulation released, the patient<br>
releases, or reduces, the downward pressure on the aerosol<br><br>
canister unit 15 whereupon the biasing mechanism in the<br>
valve assembly of the aerosol canister 17 biases the aerosol<br>
canister unit 15 back towards its rest position. The return<br>
stroke of the aerosol canister unit 15 in the actuator 3 is<br>
shown schematically in FIGURES 13A-B.<br>
As shown, as the aerosol canister unit 15 is translated<br>
upwardly in the direction of arrow D, the engagement of the<br>
rack 13 with the pinion 153 causes the drive wheel 151 to<br>
rotate in an opposite direction (arrow E) . The toggle-link<br>
coupling between the drive wheel 151 and pawl 200 causes the<br>
pawl 200 to rotate in an opposite direction (arrow F) . The<br>
rotation of the pawl 200 in the direction of arrow F causes<br>
the pawl arm 201 to pull the units wheel 59 in the same<br>
direction through the engagement of the pawl tooth 203 with<br>
the trailing flank surface of the ratchet tooth 74 which it<br>
dropped over on the downstroke of the aerosol canister unit<br>
15 in the actuator 3. In this regard, the fixed pawl 18 is<br>
resiliently formed so that it is able to be flexed out of<br>
the way by one of the ratchet teeth 74 and then drop behind<br>
that tooth 74 to prevent counter-rotation of the units wheel<br>
59 at the end of the return stroke of the aerosol canister<br>
unit 15 in the actuator 3.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 9, once the rack 13 has caused the drive<br>
wheel 151 to rotate a predetermined angular extent, the pawl<br>
200 abuts with another end stop 66, this time presented by<br>
the cap part 31 of the outer casing 30. This prevents the<br>
pawl 200 causing more than one ratchet tooth 74 to pass the<br>
fixed pawl 18 on the return stroke of the aerosol canister<br>
unit 15. If at this stage the return stroke of the aerosol<br>
canister unit is incomplete, i.e. the rest position has not<br><br>
been reached, the drive wheel 151 is free to continue<br>
rotating relative to the slipping clutch spring 167 in the<br>
direction of arrow E (through the engagement of the rack 13<br>
with the pinion 153) .<br>
The result of the rotation of the units wheel 59 in the<br>
direction of arrow F is to cause the numerical indicia it<br>
displays in the window 25 to be decreased by one, thereby<br>
indicating to the patient that there is now one less metered<br>
dose left in the aerosol canister 17.<br>
Thus, upon each actuation cycle of the aerosol canister unit<br>
15, the units wheel 59 is caused to be rotatably indexed by<br>
an angular amount sufficient to cause the previous units<br>
figure displayed in the window 2 5 to be advanced and<br>
replaced by the next unit figure in the series, which is one<br>
less than the previous figure. Bearing in mind that the<br>
numerical indicia on the units wheel 59 are equi-angularly<br>
spaced about the circumference thereof, the units wheel 5 9<br>
is rotatively indexed by 36° upon each actuation cycle of<br>
the aerosol canister unit 15. It will thus be appreciated<br>
that the number of ratchet teeth 74 on the ratchet wheel 71<br>
corresponds to the number of numerical indicia on the units<br>
wheel 59, i.e. 10. It will further be appreciated that after<br>
each complete revolution of the units wheel 59 the same<br>
units figure is displayed in the window 25.<br>
As the units wheel 59 is rotatively indexed by the pawl-and-<br>
ratchet mechanism, the bunny tooth 77 of the units wheel 59<br>
will engage the left-hand side section 127 of the toothed<br>
wheel portion 111 of the right-hand knock gear 103 at the<br>
same point in each revolution of the units wheel 59 on the<br><br>
upper axle 53. As indicated in FIGURE 15A, the bunny tooth<br>
77 is arranged on the units wheel 59 so that its engagement<br>
with the left-hand side section 127 of the toothed wheel<br>
portion 111 of the right-hand knock gear 103 coincides with<br>
the number '0' being displayed by the units wheel 59 in the<br>
window 25. The next actuation cycle of the aerosol canister<br>
unit 15 causes the bunny tooth 77 to transmit a rotational<br>
force to the right-hand knock gear 103, through its<br>
engagement with the left-hand side section 127 of its<br>
toothed wheel portion 111. The rotation imparted to the<br>
right-hand knock gear 103 by the bunny tooth 77 of the units<br>
wheel 5 9 is transmitted to the tens wheel 61 through the<br>
meshing of the left-hand side section 127 of the toothed<br>
wheel portion 111 with the teeth 87 of the tens wheel 61.<br>
The net result of this is that the numerical indicia<br>
displayed by the units wheel 59 and tens wheel 61 are<br>
concurrently decremented by one. In the case shown in<br>
FIGURES 15A-B, the result is to decrement the number<br>
displayed in the window 25 from '160' to '159'. This is also<br>
illustrated in FIGURES 14A-F.<br>
During the transmission of the rotational indexing of the<br>
units wheel 59 to the tens wheel 61 through the right-hand<br>
knock gear 103, the right-hand side section 123 of the<br>
toothed wheel portion 111 of the right-hand knock gear 103<br>
is received in a recess 78 (FIGURE 15A) formed in the rim 65<br>
of the units wheel 59 which is co-extensive with the gap<br>
between the ears of the bunny tooth 77.<br>
As the tens wheel 61 is incrementally driven by the units<br>
wheel 59 through the right-hand knock gear 103 at every<br>
complete rotation of the units wheel 59 (when the '0'<br><br>
decrements to '9'), the bunny tooth 93 on the tens wheel 61<br>
is advanced towards engagement with the left-hand knock gear<br>
105, specifically the left-hand side section 129 of the<br>
toothed wheel portion 113 thereof. As before, when the tens<br>
wheel 61 is angularly positioned so that it displays the<br>
figure '0' in the window 25 (at which point the units wheel<br>
59 also displays its '0' figure in the window 25), the bunny<br>
tooth 93 is disposed adjacent a tooth of the left-hand side<br>
section 129 of the toothed wheel portion 113 of the left-<br>
hand knock gear 105. The result of the next actuation cycle<br>
of the aerosol canister unit 15 is to cause the rotation or<br>
motion imparted to the tens wheel 59, by the co-operation of<br>
the units wheel 59 and the right-hand knock gear 103, to be<br>
transmitted to the hundreds wheel 63 in likewise manner.<br>
This results in the numerical indicia displayed by the<br>
hundreds wheel 63 in the window 25 being decrement by one,<br>
whereby the full number displayed in the window by the drums<br>
sub-assembly 50 is decremented by one from a number which is<br>
a factor of one hundred, e.g. '100' to '099'.<br>
As will be understood from FIGURES 8 and 14A-F, when the<br>
tens wheel 61 drives the hundreds wheel 63 through the left-<br>
hand knock gear 105, the right-hand side section 125 of the<br>
toothed wheel portion 113 of the left-hand knock gear 105 is<br>
received in a recess 94 in the rim 67 of the tens wheel 61<br>
which is co-extensive with the space between the ears of the<br>
bunny tooth 93 .<br>
In addition to the features of the counting mechanism<br>
described above, the counting mechanism further comprises a<br>
"lockout" arrangement which locks the drums sub-assembly 50<br>
from being driven when each indicator wheel 59,61,63 is<br><br>
angularly positioned on the upper axle 53 of the axle spring<br>
51 so that the display reads '000'. However, the lockout<br>
arrangement is such as not to prevent the aerosol canister<br>
unit 15 still being able to be actuated to dispense doses of<br>
medicinal aerosol formulation still remaining in the aerosol<br>
canister 17. In this connection, as a matter of routine,<br>
medicinal aerosol canisters are overfilled (compared to the<br>
label claim) for safety issues. For example, for rescue<br>
medicaments, such as bronchodilators, it is imperative that<br>
the patient still be able to use the aerosol canister unit<br>
15 after the label claim of metered doses has been used.<br>
Referring now to FIGURES 4, 16A and 17A, for example, the<br>
hundreds wheel 63 carries a peg 98 which, when the hundreds<br>
wheel 63 is angularly oriented so as to display a '0' in the<br>
window 25, abuts with a stop 42 provided in the cap part 31<br>
of the outer casing 3 0 of the dose counter module 19. This<br>
abutment of the peg 98 with the stop 42 prevents further<br>
rotation of the hundreds wheel 63 by the pawl-and-ratchet<br>
drive mechanism. Moreover, the left-hand knock gear 105 is<br>
also locked from further rotation due to its interengagement<br>
with the locked hundreds wheel 63. So, once the hundreds<br>
wheel 63 has been locked by the abutment of the peg 98 with<br>
the stop 42, the tens wheel 61 is able to complete one<br>
further revolution on the upper axle 53 before it too<br>
becomes locked from further rotation through engagement of<br>
the bunny tooth 93 with the left-hand knock gear 105. The<br>
locking of the tens wheel 61 further results in the right-<br>
hand knock gear 103 being locked from further rotation due<br>
to its tooth engagement with the tens wheel 61. As will be<br>
understood, the tens wheel 61 becomes locked out when it too<br>
displays a '0' in the window 25.<br><br>
Once the tens wheel 61 has been locked out, the units wheel<br>
59 is able to complete just one more revolution for it to<br>
display a '0' in the window 25. The units wheel 59 then in<br>
turn becomes locked out by the interengagement of its bunny<br>
tooth 77 with the right-hand knock gear 103. See FIGURES<br>
16A-P.<br>
If a patient wishes to use the aerosol canister unit 17<br>
after the drums sub-assembly 50 has been locked out, the<br>
actuation cycle is still able to be completed through the<br>
clutch spring 167 slipping on the boss 159 of the drive<br>
wheel 151. In other words, the drive system is disconnected<br>
from the drum sub-assembly 50 by the slipping clutch 167.<br>
This is shown schematically in FIGURE 17B.<br>
Referring now to FIGURES 18 to 21, a preferred sleeve part<br>
33 is shown. This sleeve part 33, like the one shown in<br>
FIGURES 1 to 3, is adapted to be attached to a cap part 31<br>
(see FIGURE 5) to form a casing for a dose counter module<br>
19. It has four holes 131, 132, 133, 134 for receiving posts<br>
35 on the cap part 31. Two of the holes 131, 132 are<br>
cylindrical for receiving cylindrical posts 35. The other<br>
two holes are generally cylindrical but with a flattened<br>
part (i.e. generally D shaped) for receiving correspondingly<br>
shaped posts 35 on the cap part 31.<br>
The two non-cylindrical holes 133, 134 are relatively<br>
rotated so that the cap part 31 can only be fitted in one<br>
orientation even if the posts 35 are symmetrically arranged.<br><br>
Differently shaped holes could be provided, and would need<br>
to be provided for differently shaped posts 3 5 such as those<br>
shown in FIGURE 4 (only one post 35 is non-cylindrical) or<br>
FIGURE 3 (the posts 3 5 have a square section, with hook<br>
clips 3 7 on the ends thereof).<br>
Two posts 135 are also provided on the sleeve part 33<br>
extending from the bottom 137 thereof. These posts 135<br>
engage into holes 136 provided in the cap part 31 (see<br>
FIGURE 5) . The posts 13 5 on the sleeve part 3 3 are shorter<br>
than the posts 3 5 on the cap part 31.<br>
The sleeve part 3 3 is generally cylindrical. However, in the<br>
bottom 13 7, there is moulded a base moulding having a<br>
generally U-shaped configuration to match the U-shaped<br>
configuration of the cap part 31 defined by the concave cut-<br>
out 41 (see, e.g., FIGURE 4). This U-shaped base moulding<br>
further defines the position for the canister's valve stem<br>
27 (see FIGURES 22 and 23) and the stand or stem block 13<br>
(described above with reference to the prior art) to fit<br>
into. Further it defines part of the protrusion 23 described<br>
above (the protrusion 23 receives the window 25).<br>
The base moulding extends from the bottom 137 of the sleeve<br>
part 33 up to a base wall 139. The outlet end of the<br>
canister 17 may, in use, rest against an upper side of this<br>
base wall 139 (or on supports provided thereon) , as will be<br>
described with reference to FIGURES 22 and 23 below. The<br>
moulding, on its lower side, however, provides, in<br>
combination with the cap part 31, a cavity into which the<br>
indexing or counting mechanism, such as the drums sub-<br>
assembly 50, can be fitted. See FIGURES 22 and 23.<br><br>
The cylindrical portion 140 of the sleeve part 33 can accept<br>
more than one style of canister 17, in this embodiment<br>
different styles of valve assembly. As an example, FIGURE<br>
22 shows a canister 17 which is fitted with a first type of<br>
valve assembly 250. FIGURE 23 shows the canister 17 fitted<br>
with a second, different type of valve assembly 300 (i.e.<br>
the can is the same, but the valve assembly differs) . As<br>
will be seen, the valves 250,300 have valve stem ends 29 (or<br>
ferrules) of different shape. In the first valve assembly<br>
250, there is a small nose 49 adjacent the valve stem 27.<br>
The nose 49 of the second valve assembly 300, however, is<br>
much longer, axially. Moreover, the valve assemblies 250,300<br>
protrude from the associated cans by a different distance<br>
D1,D2, i.e. the valve assemblies 250,300 have a different<br>
thickness. So, the valve stems 27 are spaced outboard from<br>
the can at different distances D1,D2.<br>
As a result of these differences, the canisters 17 sit<br>
differently in the sleeve part 33. However, it is important<br>
that the tip of each valve stem 27 be positioned at a<br>
common, or substantially common, position relative to a<br>
reference surface of the dose counter module 19, e.g. the<br>
base wall 139. In other words, the spatial position of the<br>
tip of each valve stem 27 in the dose counter module 19,<br>
when assembled to the respective aerosol canister 17, must<br>
be the same, or substantially the same. Expressed another<br>
way, the valve stems 27 must be spaced at the same, or<br>
substantially same, distance from the reference surface of<br>
the dose counter module 19.<br><br>
To this end, the upper side of the base wall 139 has two<br>
differently sized concentric supports or ledges 141, 142.<br>
The first ledge 141 comprises an annulus (see FIGURE 20)<br>
extending upwards from the base wall 13 9. It has an<br>
appropriate height to support, in use, the first valve<br>
assembly 250, as shown by arrow 143 in FIGURE 22. The second<br>
ledge 142 comprises a smaller annulus extending upwards from<br>
the base wall 139. It is concentric with the first ledge<br>
141. However, it extends upwards to a lesser extent. It is<br>
adapted to support, in use, the second valve assembly 3 00,<br>
as marked by arrow 144 in FIGURE 23.<br>
The base wall 139 also comprises an aperture 145 in its<br>
centre, concentric with the two annuluses. The aperture 145<br>
allows the valve stem 27 of the canister 17 to extend<br>
through the base wall 139 so that it can be inserted into<br>
the stand or stem block 333.<br>
As shown in FIGURES 22 and 23, the ledges 141,142<br>
respectively support the first and second valve assemblies<br>
250,300 in the sleeve part 33 such that the valve stems 27<br>
extend through the aperture 4 5 by the same distance, or<br>
substantially the same distance.<br>
In this way, the rest positions in the actuator 3 of the<br>
aerosol canister units 15 incorporating the different valve<br>
assemblies 250,300 is the same, or substantially the same.<br>
This is because the spatial position of the valve stem tips<br>
in the respective dose counter module 19 is the same.<br>
The sleeve part 33 also comprises a split ring collar 43, as<br>
previously described, for assisting in the connection of the<br><br>
sleeve part 33 to the canister 17 via the neck 47, which is<br>
annular. The wall 147 of the cylindrical portion 140 of the<br>
sleeve part 33 has an internal wall surface having a step or<br>
shoulder 146 for resting the collar 43 on. FIGURE 3 shows<br>
this as a separately made ledge that is attached to the<br>
internal wall surface. The shoulder 146 assists in locating<br>
the collar 43 correctly for adhering or welding it to the<br>
sleeve part 33 for securing the canister 17 in the sleeve<br>
part 33 with the correct depth of insertion.<br>
The top 138 of the wall 147 is chamfered also to assist in<br>
the insertion of the collar 43 and canister 17 into the<br>
sleeve part 33.<br>
The above described components all can easily be fabricated<br>
and can be assembled using automated apparatus. Therefore<br>
they provide a more cost effective solution than the prior<br>
art.<br>
Although the pMDI 1 described above with reference to the<br>
FIGURES of drawings is shown for oral inhalation, the<br>
mouthpiece 9 may be replaced with a nozzle for insertion<br>
into a patient's nostril, i.e. for intra-nasal use.<br>
The therapeutic agent contained in the aerosol canister 17<br>
may for the treatment of mild, moderate or severe acute or<br>
chronic symptoms or for prophylactic treatment. The<br>
therapeutic agent is preferably for treating respiratory<br>
diseases, e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>
(COPD), although may be for other therapeutic indications,<br>
e.g. treating rhinitis.<br><br>
Appropriate therapeutic agents or medicaments may thus be<br>
selected from, for example, analgesics, e.g., codeine,<br>
dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine; anginal<br>
preparations, e.g., diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g.,<br>
cromoglycate (e.g. as the sodium salt), ketotifen or<br>
nedocromil (e.g. as the sodium salt); antiinfectives e.g.,<br>
cephalosporins, penicillins, streptomycin, sulphonamides,<br>
tetracyclines and pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g.,<br>
methapyrilene; anti- inflammatories, e.g., beclomethasone<br>
(e.g. as the dipropionate ester), fluticasone (e.g. as the<br>
propionate ester), flunisolide, budesonide, rofleponide,<br>
mometasone (e.g. as the furoate ester), ciclesonide,<br>
triamcinolone (e.g. as the acetonide), 6a, 9a-difluoro-liP-<br>
hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-propionyloxy-androsta-1,4-diene<br>
-17p-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl) ester<br>
or 6a, 9a-Difluoro-17a-[ (2-furanylcarbonyl)oxyj-lip-hydroxy-<br>
16a-methyl-3-oxo-androsta-l,4-diene-17P-carbothioic acid S-<br>
fluoromethyl ester; antitussives, e.g., noscapine;<br>
bronchodilators, e.g., albuterol (e.g. as free base or<br>
sulphate), salmeterol (e.g. as xinafoate), ephedrine,<br>
adrenaline, fenoterol (e.g. as hydrobromide), formoterol<br>
(e.g. as fumarate), isoprenaline, metaproterenol,<br>
phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol (e.g. as<br>
acetate), reproterol (e.g. as hydrochloride), rimiterol,<br>
terbutaline (e.g. as sulphate), isoetharine, tulobuterol or<br>
4-hydroxy-7-[2-[ [2-[ [3-(2-phenylethoxy) propyl] sulfonyl]<br>
ethyl] amino]ethyl-2(3H) benzo-thiazolone; PDE4 inhibitors<br>
e.g. cilomilast or roflumilast; leukotriene antagonists e.g.<br>
montelukast, pranlukast and zafirlukast; [adenosine 2a<br>
agonists, e.g. 2R,3R, 4S,5R)-2-[6-Amino-2-(lS-hydroxymethyl-<br>
2-phenyl-ethylamino)-purin-9-yl]-5 -(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-<br><br>
yl)-tetrahydro-furan-3,4-diol (e.g. as maleate)]; [α4<br>
integrin inhibitors e.g. (2S)-3-[4-({[4-(aminocarbonyl)-1-<br>
piperidinyl] carbonyl}oxy)phenyl]-2-[((2S)-4-methyl-2-{ [2-<br>
(2-ethylphenoxy)acetyl]amino}pentanoyl)amino] propanoic acid<br>
 (e.g as free acid or potassium salt)], diuretics, e.g.,<br>
amiloride; anticholinergics, e.g., ipratropium (e.g. as<br>
bromide). tiotropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones,<br>
e.g., cortisone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone; xanthines,<br>
e.g., aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine<br>
 theophyllinate or theophylline; therapeutic proteins and<br>
peptides, e.g., insulin or glucagons. It will be clear to a<br>
person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the<br>
medicaments may be used in the form of salts, (e.g., as<br>
alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as<br>
esters (e.g., lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g.,<br>
hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability of the<br>
medicament and/or to minimise the solubility of the<br>
medicament in the propellant.<br>
Preferably, the medicament is an anti-inflammatory compound<br>
for the treatment of inflammatory disorders or diseases such<br>
as asthma and rhinitis.<br>
Preferably, the medicament is formulated in a<br>
hydrofluoroalkane propellant, such as HPA-134a or HFA-227 or<br>
a combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the medicament is an anti-inflammatory steroid,<br>
such as a corticosteroid, for instance fluticasone, e.g. as<br>
the propionate ester, or a long acting beta agonist (LABA),<br>
such as salmeterol, e.g. as the xinafoate salt, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br><br>
Preferred medicaments are salmeterol, salbutamol, albuterol,<br>
fluticasone and beclomethasone and salts, esters or solvates<br>
thereof, for instance fluticasone propionate, albuterol<br>
sulphate, salmeterol xinafoate and beclomethasone<br>
diproprionate.<br>
The medicament may also be a glucocorticoid compound, which<br>
has anti-inflammatory properties. One suitable<br>
glucocorticoid compound has the chemical name: 6a, 9a-<br>
Dif luoro-17a- (l-oxopropoxy) -llp-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3 - oxo-<br>
androsta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester<br>
(fluticasone propionate). Another suitable glucocorticoid<br>
compound has the chemical name: 6α, 9α-difluoro-17a-[(2-<br>
furanylcarbonyl)oxy]-llβ-hydroxy-l6α-methyl-3-oxo-androsta<br>
1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester. A<br>
further suitable glucocorticoid compound has the chemical<br>
name: 6α,9α-Difluoro-lip-hydroxy-16a-methyl-17a-[(4-methyl-<br>
1,3-thiazole-5-carbonyl)oxy]-3-oxo-androsta-l,4-diene - 17β -<br>
carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester.<br>
Other suitable anti-inflammatory compounds include NSAIDs<br>
e.g. PDE4 inhibitors, leukotriene antagonists, iNOS<br>
inhibitors, tryptase and elastase inhibitors, beta-2<br>
integrin antagonists and adenosine 2a agonists.<br>
The medicaments may be delivered in combinations. As an<br>
example, there may be provided salbutamol (e.g. as the free<br>
base of the sulphate salt) or salmeterol (e.g. as the<br>
xinafoate salt) in combination with an anti-inflammatory<br>
steroid, such as beclomethasone (e.g. as an ester,<br><br>
preferably dipropionate) or fluticasone (e.g. as an ester,<br>
preferably propionate).<br>
The actuation indicator of the present invention is not<br>
 limited for use with an aerosol container,as in the example<br>
described with reference to the FIGURES of drawings, but may<br>
be used with other types of dispensing device. Moreover,<br>
the dispensing device need not necessarily be for dispensing<br>
medicament.<br><br>
The present invention has been described above purely by way<br>
of example. Modifications, in detail, however, may be made<br>
within the scope of the invention, as defined in the claims<br>
appended hereto.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the use of words herein such as<br>
"substantially", "generally", "about" and the like in<br>
relation to parameters or properties etc. is meant to<br>
encompass the absolute parameter or property as well as non-<br>
consequential deviations therefrom.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An assembly for an actuation indicator (19) comprising<br>
