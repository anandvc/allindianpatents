				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a loose tube optical cable, and more particularly to a<br>
loose tube optical cable having an unstranded structure that has no inclusion for keeping an<br>
original form of the optical cable and has no intended twist of the loose tube on an outer<br>
circumference of a tensile strength member of the cable.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The optical fiber is generally classified into a loose tube optical cable and a ribbon slot<br>
optical cable depending on the structure of the optical cable core. Among them, the loose tube<br>
optical cable is configured so that a plurality of optical fiber units in which the required number<br>
of optical fibers are mounted in a plastic tube together with jelly compound (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as 'loose tube optical fiber unit') are stranded around a tensile strength member positioned at<br>
the center of the cable. At this time, a plurality of the loose tube optical fiber units are stranded<br>
around the tensile strength member in a helical or an SZ strand in order to minimize the stress<br>
caused to the optical fiber by the bending of the optical cable when the optical cable is installed or<br>
taken up around a drum.<br>
More specifically, referring to FIG. 1, the conventional loose tube optical cable 10<br>
includes a tensile strength member 20 for minimizing various stresses exerted to the optical cable<br>
10 when the optical cable 10 is taken up around a drum or installed in or out of a building, a<br>
plurality of loose tube optical fiber units 30 longitudinally stranded by a helical or an SZ method<br>
around the tensile strength member 20, a cable coating 50 for surrounding an aggregation of the<br>
tensile strength member 20 and the optical fiber units 30 and protecting an optical fiber 40 in the<br>
optical cable 10 from an external force when the cable is installed (e.g., side pressure or pulling),<br>
an external force after the installation of the cable (e.g., dropping of an article, compressive<br>
breakdown due to an article) and external circumstances (e.g., penetration of water), and a filler<br>
60 for filling a space in the cable coating 50 except the loose tube optical fiber units 30.<br>
However, in case there are required a smaller number of loose tube optical fiber units 30<br>
in the loose tube optical cable 10 having the structure as shown in FIG. 1, the remained space in<br>
the cable coating 50 is replaced with inclusions in order to focus the stress on the tensile strength<br>
member 20 by keeping the optical cable 10 in its original form and minimize the stress of the<br>
optical fiber by keeping the helical or SZ strand of the loose tube optical fiber units 30 around the<br>
tensile strength member 20.<br>
For example, FIG. 2 shows an optical cable of 1+6 structure in which 6 loose tube optical<br>
fiber units 30 should be stranded around one tensile strength member 20. However, if there are<br>
where a is a ratio of the radius of the loose tube optical fiber unit to a radius of the tensile<br>
strength member, p\ and pi are densities of the loose tube optical fiber unit and the tensile<br>
strength member respectively, and y is a ratio of a thickness of the loose tube to a radius of the<br>
loose tube.<br>
In case the aggregation has one tensile strength member and two loose tube optical fiber<br>
units, the tensile strength member and the optical fiber units may have geometric parameters<br>
satisfying the following Equation 2:<br>
Equation 2<br>
where a is a ratio of the radius of the loose tube optical fiber unit to a radius of the tensile<br>
strength member, p1 and p2 are densities of the loose tube optical fiber unit and the tensile<br>
strength member respectively, and y is a ratio of a thickness of the loose tube to a radius of the<br>
loose tube.<br>
In the present invention, it is important not to affect the prolonged reliability of the<br>
optical fibers when the optical cable is installed by means of adjusting the geometric parameters<br>
of the tensile strength member and the loose tube optical fiber unit.<br>
Generally, the prolonged reliability of the optical fiber is not affected when the maximum<br>
bending radius of the optical cable is more than 20 times of the optical cable diameter and the<br>
maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber is not more than 0.3% during installing the<br>
optical cable.<br>
Thus, in the present invention having the loose tube optical fiber unit, the prolonged<br>
reliability of the optical fiber may be ensured when the maximum modulus of elongation of the<br>
optical fiber is not more than 0.3% at the maximum bending radius of the optical cable (equal to<br>
20 times of the optical cable diameter) even though not helically nor SZ twisting the loose tube<br>
optical fiber unit around the tensile strength member.<br>
Therefore, the loose tube optical cable of 1+2 structure or 1+1 structure selects the<br>
geometric parameters of the tensile strength member and the loose tube optical fiber unit to<br>
satisfy the following Equation 3 so that the maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber<br>
may be restricted not more than 0.3% when the maximum bending radius of the optical cable is<br>
20 times of the optical cable diameter.<br>
Equation 3<br>
R-r+t +<br>
-2-
where R and r are radii of the tensile strength member and the loose tube optical fiber<br>
unit respectively, / is a thickness of the loose tube, and d is a diameter of the optical fiber inserted<br>
into the loose tube optical fiber unit wherein the number of used optical fiber is one or more. In<br>
case more than one optical fiber is used, d is calculated using the following equation:<br>
„ , , r . , „ ^ Jnumber of optical fibers<br>
2x(diameter_oj _optical_ fiber)x —<br>
n<br>
In the present invention, the optical fiber mounted in the loose tube optical fiber unit is<br>
preferably installed in a plastic tube with an EFL (Excess Fiber Length) of 0.0 ~ 0.2%.<br>
In addition, the loose tube optical cable of the present invention may also include a<br>
binder for binding the aggregation in a longitudinal direction, and filler for preventing penetration<br>
of water, which is interposed between the cable coating and the aggregation.<br>
A loose tube optical cable having an unstranded aggregation comprising: (a) a tensile strength<br>
member longitudinally elongated and having a central axis deviated from the center of the optical<br>
cable; (b) a loose tube optical fiber unit longitudinally elongated without intended twist against<br>
the tensile strength member; and (c) a cable coating for wrapping an aggregation in which the<br>
tensile strength member and the loose tube optical fiber unit are straightly aggregated, wherein<br>
the center of mass of the unstranded aggregation is positioned within the tensile strength member.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail referring to the<br>
drawings. First of all, terms and words used in the specification and the claims should be<br>
interpreted not in a limited normal or dictionary meaning, but to include meanings and concepts<br>
conforming with technical aspects of the present invention, based on the face that inventors may<br>
appropriately define a concept of a term to describe his/her own invention in a best way.<br>
Therefore, the configurations described in the specification and drawn in the figures are just most<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, not to show all of the technical aspects of the<br>
present invention. So, it should be understood that there might be various equalities and<br>
modifications to be replaced with them.<br>
FIG. 3 and 4 are sectional views showing loose tube optical cables respectively having<br>
1+2 structure and 1+1 structure according to embodiments of the present invention. Here, "1+2<br>
structure" means a structure in which one tensile strength member and two loose tube optical<br>
fiber units are aggregated, while "1+1 structure" means a structure in which one tensile strength<br>
member and one loose tube optical fiber unit are aggregated.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the loose tube optical cable A or B according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a tensile strength member 80 elongated to a<br>
longitudinal direction (or, a Z-direction) and having a central axis deviated from the center of the<br>
optical cable A or B, at least one loose tube optical fiber unit 90 elongated to the longitudinal<br>
direction (or, the Z-direction) without intended helical or SZ twist around the tensile strength<br>
member 80, a binder HOa or 11 Ob for binding an aggregation lOOa or lOOb so that the tensile<br>
strength member 80 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 90 are aggregated therein in an<br>
unstranded structure, a cable coating 120 for wrapping the unstranded structure lOOa or lOOb<br>
bound by the binder 1 lOa or 1 lOb, and a filler 130 interposed between the aggregation lOOa or<br>
lOOb and the cable coating 120.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the loose tube optical fiber unit 90 is<br>
structured so that a predetermined number of optical fibers 140 are received in filler 150 filled in<br>
a plastic tube for preventing penetration of water. In this embodiment, the filler 150 for<br>
preventing penetration of water may preferably adopt jelly compound or silicon oil, but not<br>
limited to those cases. However, the filler 150 for preventing penetration of water should ensure<br>
the optical fibers 140 to be capable of moving in the plastic tube.<br>
In the loose tube optical fiber unit 90, the optical fiber 140 is preferably mounted in the<br>
plastic tube with an EFL (Excess Fiber Length) of 0.0 ~ 0.2%. In this case, though the loose tube<br>
optical fiber unit 90 is transformed to some degree, a resultant force is not exerted to the optical<br>
fiber 140, thereby preventing the light signal loss caused by external pressure.<br>
The optical cable A or B according to the embodiment of the present invention basically<br>
does not have any unnecessary inclusion, so a central axis of the tensile strength member 80 and<br>
the center of mass of the cable are not incident with a central axis of the optical cable A or B.<br>
However, the optical cable A or B according to the present invention is configured so that the<br>
center of mass of the optical cable A or B is restricted within the tensile strength member 80 by<br>
selecting geometric parameters of the tensile strength member 80 and the loose tube optical fiber<br>
unit 90 to satisfy predetermined conditions described later. At this time, conditions of the<br>
geometric parameters are more specifically determined using properties of the tensile strength<br>
member 80 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 90, described later as well. As mentioned above,<br>
if the center of mass of the optical cable A or B is restricted within the tensile strength member 80<br>
by endowing conditions to the geometric parameters, the force applied to the optical cable A or B<br>
may focus its point of application on the tensile strength member 80, thereby minimizing the<br>
effects influenced on the optical fibers received in the loose tube optical fiber unit 90.<br>
In addition, since the optical cable A and B according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention has the unstranded structure, the loose tube optical fiber unit 90 is not helically or SZ<br>
twisted. In this case, when the optical cable A or B is installed or taken up around a drum, a<br>
stress may be caused to the optical fibers 140 received in the loose tube optical fiber unit 90 and<br>
thereby deteriorate the characteristics of the optical fibers 140. In order to solve this problem, in<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, predetermined conditions are endowed to the geometric<br>
parameters of the tensile strength member 80 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 90 so that a<br>
maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber 140 may be not more than 0.3%, which is<br>
generally required for ensuring prolonged reliability of the optical cable A or B though the optical<br>
cable A or B is bent to have a radius as much as 20 times of the cable diameter, which is a<br>
maximum bending radius generally required for the optical cable A or B. These geometric<br>
parameters will be described later in detail with reference to FIGs. 7a, 7b and 8.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the tensile strength member 80 may use a<br>
Kevlar aramid yarn, a fiberglass epoxy rod, an FRP (Fiber glass Reinforced Plastics), a highstrength<br>
fiber, a steel or a steel wire. However, the present invention is not limited to those cases.<br>
hi the embodiment of the present invention, the cable coating 120 may have a three-layer<br>
structure having a taping layer 120a, a moisture-proof layer 120b made of a laminated aluminum<br>
tape, and an external sheath layer 120c made of polyethylene. In addition, the filler 130 may<br>
adopt jelly compound. However, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the configuration of<br>
the cable coating 120 and the kind of the filler 130 may be variously changed in the well-known<br>
technical scope according to usage and installation environments of the optical cable. In some<br>
cases, the filler 130 may not be included in the optical cable A or B.<br>
In the optical cable A or B according to the embodiment of the present invention as<br>
shown in FIGs. 3 and 4, the geometric parameter conditions for restricting the center of mass of<br>
the cable within the tensile strength member80 are described below in detail, for each case of the<br>
loose tube optical cables A and B having 1+2 structure and 1+1 structure respectively.<br>
Loose Tube Optical Cable having 1+2 Structure<br>
FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing an aggregation 200 in which first and second loose<br>
tube optical fiber units 170 and 180 having a mass m and a radius r and a tensile strength member<br>
190 having a mass M and a radius R are aggregated in a straight structure, on a X-Y coordinate<br>
system.<br>
In the loose tube optical cable having 1+2 structure as shown in FIG. 5, a central<br>
coordinate Cl of the tensile strength member 190 and each central coordinate C2 and C3 of the<br>
first and second loose tube optical fiber units 170 and 180 may be expressed as follows.<br>
Cl:(r,r)<br>
C2:(3r,r)<br>
C3 : (2r, (R + rf-r2 + r )<br>
When a position of the center of mass of the aggregation 200 is CCM (XCM, VCM), a<br>
coordinate of the center of mass of the aggregation 200 may be calculated using the above central<br>
coordinates Cl, C2 and C3 as follows.<br>

On the other hand, if it is defined that the first and second loose tube optical fiber units<br>
170 and 180 have a tube thickness /, which is /times of a tube radius r, the tube thickness / may<br>
be expressed as yr (but, 0

If substituting Equations (3) and (4) related to the masses m and Minto Equations (1) and<br>

If it is determined that the center of mass of the aggregation 200 is positioned within the<br>
tensile strength member 190, the center of mass of the optical cable is also restricted within the<br>
tensile strength member 190. In this reason, the center of mass coordinate of the aggregation 200<br>
should be positioned in a boundary of the tensile strength member 190. This condition may be<br>
accomplished when the Equations (5) and (6) expressing the center of mass coordinates satisfy<br>
the following Equations (7) and (8).<br>

If substituting Equations (5) and (6) into Equations (7) and (8) and replacing r with crR (r<br>

may be generated.<br>

Equation (7)' is always satisfied since a is larger than 0. Thus, when the densities pi and<br>
Pi of the tensile strength member 190 and the first and second loose tube optical fiber units 170<br>
and 180 are given, the loose tube optical cable of which the center of mass is restricted within the<br>
tensile strength member 190 according to the present invention may be realized by suitably<br>
selecting the radius ratio a, which is a geometric parameter between the tensile strength member<br>

190 and the loose tube optical fiber units 170 and 180, and the thickness ratio y of the loose tube<br>
to the loose tube radius to satisfy Equation (8)'.<br>
For example, in case the tensile strength member 190 is FRP (Fiber glass Reinforced<br>
Plastics: p2 is 1.7 kg/m3); the loose tube is PP (Polypropylene: pi is 0.88 kg/m3); and y= 0.05, the<br>
center of mass of the optical cable is positioned within the tensile strength member 190 if the<br>
geometric parameter a satisfies the range 0 
strength member 190 are identical to the above condition and the loose tube is PBT<br>
(Polybutyleneterephthalate: pi = 1.31 kg/ kg/m3), the center of mass of the optical cable is<br>
restricted within the tensile strength member 190 if the geometric parameter a satisfies the range<br>

Loose Tube Optical Cable having 1+1 Structure<br>
FIG. 6 is a sectional view showing an aggregation 230 in which a loose tube optical fiber<br>
unit 210 having a mass m and a radius r and a tensile strength member 220 having a mass M and<br>
a radius R are aggregated in a straight structure, on a X-Y coordinate system.<br>
In the loose tube optical cable having 1+1 structure as shown in FIG. 6, a central<br>
coordinate Cl of the loose tube optical fiber unit 210 and a central coordinate C2 of the tensile<br>
strength member 220 may be expressed as follows.<br>
Cl:(r,r)<br>
C2:(r,2r + R)<br>
When a position of the center of mass of the aggregation 230 is CCM (XCM, ycM)&gt; the<br>
coordinate of the center of mass of the aggregation 230 may be calculated using the above central<br>
coordinates Cl and C2 as follows.<br>

On the other hand, if it is defined that the loose tube optical fiber unit 210 has a tube<br>

If substituting Equations (11) and (12) related to the masses m and Minto Equations (9)<br>
and (10) related to the center of mass coordinate and replacing r with a'R (r = a'R), the center of<br>
mass coordinate may be arranged as follows.<br>

If it is determined that the center of mass of the aggregation 230 is positioned within the<br>
tensile strength member 220, the center of mass of the optical cable is also restricted within the<br>
tensile strength member 220. In this reason, the center of mass coordinate of the aggregation 230<br>
should be positioned in the boundary of the tensile strength member 220. This condition may be<br>
accomplished when the Equations (13) and (14) expressing the center of mass coordinates satisfy<br>
the following Equations (15) and (16).<br>

If substituting Equations (13) and (14) into Equations (15) and (16) and replacing r with<br>

Equation (15)' is always satisfied since a is larger than 0. Thus, when the densities p\ and /% of<br>

optical cable of which the center of mass is restricted within the tensile strength member 220<br>
according to the present invention may be realized by suitably selecting the radius ratio a, which<br>
is a geometric parameter between the tensile strength member 220 and the loose tube optical fiber<br>
unit 210, and the thickness ratio y of the loose tube to the loose tube radius to satisfy Equation<br>

For example, in case the tensile strength member is FRP (Fiber glass Reinforced Plastics:<br>

(Polybutyleneterephthalate: pt = 1.31 kg/ kg/m3), the center of mass of the optical cable is<br>
restricted within the tensile strength member if the geometric parameter a satisfies the range 0 

Hereinbefore, the embodiments of the loose tube optical cables having 1+2 structure and<br>
1+1 structure in which the center of mass of the unstranded structure is positioned within the<br>
tensile strength member are described. However, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the<br>
technical aspect of the present invention may be applied to other loose tube optical cables having,<br>
for example, 1+3 structure or 1+4 structure, not limited to those cases.<br>
On the other hand, the optical cable of the present invention does not have the<br>
aggregation structure in which the loose tube optical fiber unit is helically or SZ twisted around<br>
the tensile strength member, as mentioned above. Thus, when the optical cable is installed or<br>
taken up around a drum, a stress may be applied to the optical fiber of the loose tube optical fiber<br>
unit due to the bending of the cable, which may cause deterioration of the characteristics of the<br>
optical fiber. In order to solve this problem, the embodiment of the present invention endows<br>
predetermined conditions to the geometric parameters of the tensile strength member and the<br>
loose tube optical fiber unit so that a maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber may<br>
not exceed 0.3%, which is generally required for ensuring prolonged reliability of the optical<br>
cable though the optical cable is bent to have a radius as much as 20 times of the cable diameter,<br>
which is a maximum bending radius generally required for the optical cable.<br>
The geometric parameter conditions required for satisfying the elongation condition at<br>
the maximum bending radius may be calculated as follows for the loose tube optical cable<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7a, in the loose tube optical cable 240 having 1+1 structure according<br>
to the present invention, the following Equation (17) should be satisfied in order that a maximum<br>
modulus of elongation of the optical cable 240 becomes not more than 0.3% when the maximum<br>
bending radius is 20D.<br>
initial<br>
Here, Lbending is a length of the optical fiber 270 mounted in the loose tube of the optical<br>
fiber 240 when the maximum bending radius is 20D, while Linitia, is a length of the optical cable<br>
240 itself. Thus, Lbendmg and ,/ may be expressed using the following Equations (18) and (19).<br>
Lbending<br><br>
However, since the optical fiber 270 is installed to move free in the loose tube as<br>
mentioned above, it may move within a space as much as (r-d)/(2-t) in the loose tube, as shown in<br>
FIG. 7b. Thus, the above Equation (18) is changed into the following Equation (18)'. Here, d is<br>
a diameter of the optical fiber, and / is a thickness of the loose tube.<br>
L bending = 2(40(R+r)+R - 'movable distance of the optical fiber1)*<br>
= 2(40(/Z+r)+/Z-(r-f-y ))n (18)'<br>
If substituting the Equations (18)' and (19) into the Equation (17), the geometric<br>
parameter conditions of the tensile strength member 250 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 260<br>
for maintaining the maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber 270 not more than 0.3%<br>
when the maximum bending radius of the optical cable 240 is 20D are calculated as the following<br>
Equation (20).<br>
If the loose tube optical cable of the present invention is realized by selecting the geometric<br>
parameters of the tensile strength member 250 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 260 to satisfy<br>
the above conditions, the stress exerted to the optical fiber by the bending may be minimized<br>
without helically or SZ twisting the loose tube around the tensile strength member 250.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the loose tube optical cable (Oj-O3-O3) having 1+2 structure<br>
according to the present invention has 2nr(i+2) as a Lbending value when the maximum bending<br>
radius is 20D. If the radii of the loose tube optical fiber unit 290 and the tensile strength member<br>
280 are respectively identical to [1+1 structure (Oi-O2)] and [1+2 structure (OrO3-O3)], the loose<br>
tube optical cable of 1+1 structure has 2r(i (/; as a Lbending value. However, since /y/+ is smaller<br>
than r(]+y, the loose tube optical cable of 1+2 structure has a smaller Lbending value than the loose<br>
tube optical cable of 1+1 structure. Thus, if the geometric parameters of the tensile strength<br>
member 280 and the loose tube optical fiber unit 290 of the loose tube optical cable satisfy the<br>
above-described Equation (20), the maximum modulus of elongation of the optical fiber is<br>
automatically restricted within 0.3% even in the loose tube optical cable of 1+2 structure when<br>
the maximum bending radius is 20D. This will be understood more clearly using the following<br>
Equation (21).<br>
+\) inilial(\+l) 
Am//a/(l+2)<br>
where Lbemang(i+2) ^ L/,emiing(n i), Lini,iai(i+2) = Lin,t,ai(i+i)-<br>
As mentioned above, if the geometric parameters of the tensile strength member 280 and the<br>
loose tube optical fiber unit 290 in the loose tube optical cable having 1+2 structure are chosen<br>
such that the Equation (20) is satisfied, the stress caused to the optical fiber by the bending may<br>
be minimized without helically or SZ twisting the loose tube around the tensile strength member<br>
280.<br>
As described above, the present invention accomplishes its object by endowing<br>
predetermined conditions to the geometric parameters of the tensile strength member and the<br>
loose tube optical fiber unit so that the prolonged reliability of the optical fiber may be ensured<br>
when installing the optical cable. In a more preferred case, the prolonged reliability of the optical<br>
fiber may be further improved by using an optical fiber having an EFL (Excess Fiber Length) of<br>
0.0 ~ 0.2% which is inserted into the loose tube optical fiber unit.<br>
The present invention has been described in detail. However, it should be understood<br>
that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this<br>
detailed description.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, it is possible to minimize the stress<br>
applied to the optical cable by adjusting the geometric parameters of the tensile strength member<br>
and the loose tube optical fiber unit so that the center of mass of the optical cable is restricted<br>
within the tensile strength member. In addition, by restricting the maximum modulus of<br>
elongation of the optical fiber within a<br>
predetermined range at the maximum bending radius of the optical cable, the stress applied to the<br>
optical fibers included in the optical cable may be minimized without helically or SZ twisting the<br>
loose tube.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the tube aggregating process may<br>
be omitted since the loose tube optical fiber unit is not helically or SZ twisted around the tensile<br>
strength member. In addition, by removing the inclusions used for keeping an original shape of<br>
the cable, the optical cable manufacturing processes may be simplified and the cable may become<br>
smaller and lighter.<br><br><br><br>
