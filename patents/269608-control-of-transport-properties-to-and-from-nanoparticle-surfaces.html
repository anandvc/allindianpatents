SURFACES<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/889,609<br>
filed February 13,2007 and 60/892,927 filed March 5, 2007, the entire contents of all of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nanoparticles are nanometer-sized materials e.g., metals, semiconductors, polymers,<br>
and the like, that can often posses unique characteristics because of their small size.<br>
Nanoparticles are of particular interest because of their potential for use as catalysts,<br>
photocatalysts, adsorbents, sensors, and ferrofluids, as well as for their materia! properties in<br>
for application to optical, electronic, and magnetic devices, and formulation of plastics and<br>
other materials.<br>
In practical application, however, the usefulness of a nanoparticle depends on more<br>
than just the properties exhibited in the laboratory. In practical application many interesting<br>
laboratory properties may not be realized due to interferents and undesired reactions with<br>
chemicals in the application environment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In various aspects, the present inventions provide nanoparticle compositions<br>
comprising a stabilizer and methods to tailor the permeability of a stabilizer that, e.g., impart<br>
a nanoparticle composite with certain solubility and non-aggregative characteristics. For<br>
example, in various embodiments, a stabilizer can be modified to tune its permeability to<br>
materials moving from the nanoparticle surface to the surrounding environment and/or vice<br>
versa.<br>
In various aspects, the present invention provides methods to produce nanoparticles<br>
that are stabilized, where the stabilizer provides solubility and/or prevents aggregation, and<br>
with a selected permeability to selected small chemical entities. For example, in various<br>
embodiments, the present inventions provide methods for producing a stabilized composite<br>
nanoparticle comprising the steps of: a) providing a solution comprising at least one<br><br>
nanoparticle and at least one stabilizing moiety dispersed therein; and, b) modifying at least<br>
one stabilizer moiety in the solution to change its permeability to SCEs.<br>
For example, in various embodiments, the present inventions provide nanoparticle<br>
compositions that are stabilized, where the stabilizer is chosen to allow for one or more of:<br>
(a) improved permeability to certain SCEs; (b) decreased permeability to certain SCEs; and<br>
(c) improved permeability to a first group of SCEs and decreased permeability to a second<br>
group of SCEs.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the stabilizing moiety comprises<br>
one or more polymeric stabilizers. Examples of suitable means to modify the polymeric<br>
stabilizer to change the nanoparticle transport properties include, but are not limited to, (a)<br>
radiation or chemical-induced internal and/or external crosslinking of stabilizer moieties,<br>
where the degree of crosslinking controls the permeability of the layer; (b) change of solution<br>
conditions and/or use of heating and/or cooling to induce expansion or contraction of the<br>
polymeric stabilizer layer; (c) adsorption or desorption of additional moieties (adsorbates) to<br>
the polymer network, which can be assisted by chemical bond formation or cleavage; and (d)<br>
one or more combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of suitable polymeric materials<br>
for use as stabilizer moieties are discussed herein, and but can be synthetic or naturally<br>
occurring and can be linear, branched, hyperbranched, and/or dendrimeric.<br>
As used herein, the terms "stabilizing moiety" or "stabilizer" are used interchangeably<br>
and refer to a material that interacts with the nanoparticle (e.g., through covalent, non-<br>
covalent, ionic, van der Waals, etc. bonds) and which imparts desirable solubility<br>
characteristics and/or prevents aggregation of the nanoparticles.<br>
As used herein, the terms "adsorbate" and "adsorbate moiety" are used<br>
interchangeably and refer to an entity that preferentially associates with a polymer-stabilized<br>
nanoparticle. This association can be physisorption, chemisorption, through covalent bonds,<br>
through electrostatic interactions, or through van der Waals forces and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term, "small chemical entities" (SCEs) refers to cations, anions, or<br>
neutral species of various types that are between about 0.1 nanometers (ran) to about 5 nm in<br>
size and are soluble in the solvent in which the nanoparticles are dispersed. In various<br>
embodiments, where for example the nanoparticles are provided alone or on a solid support,<br>
SCEs refer to cations, anions, or neutral species of various types that are between 0.1 nm to<br>
about 5 nm in size and in the gaseous state.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "nanoparticle composition" when referring to a nanoparticle<br>
composition comprising one or more stabilizer moieties and "stabilized nanoparticle" are<br>
used interchangeably.<br>
As used herein, the terms "solid support" and "support" are used interchangeably and<br>
refer to any solid phase material. Examples of solid supports include, but are not limited to,<br>
resins, membranes, gels, and micron-sized or larger particulates. A solid support can be<br>
composed of one or more organic polymers such as, e.g., polystyrene, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polyfluoroethylene, polyethyleneoxy, and polyacrylamide. A solid support<br>
can be composed of one or more inorganic materials, such as, e.g., glass, silica, controlled-<br>
pore-glass, or reverse-phase silica. The solid support can be porous or non-porous, and can<br>
have swelling or non-swelling characteristics.<br>
Suitable stabilizing moieties for the present invention include stabilizing moieties that<br>
can be internally or externally chemically modified to introduce new intramolecular and/or<br>
intermolecular chemical bonds between one or more stabilizing moieties, e.g., to crosslink<br>
one or more stabilizing moieties. Suitable stabilizing moieties also include stabilizing<br>
moieties taken alone or in combination, which have a three-dimensional structure that can be<br>
expanded or contracted using a chemical or physical change. Suitable stabilizing moieties<br>
also include stabilizing moieties taken alone or in combination that are modified to increase<br>
or decrease the thickness or density of the layer about a nanoparticle containing the<br>
stabilizing moieties.<br>
In various embodiments, suitable stabilizing moieties include, but are not limited to,<br>
polymers, ligands, coordinating ions, coordinating complexes, or combinations thereof.<br>
In various embodiments, the present inventions provide a stabilized nanoparticle<br>
incorporated onto or into a solid support using standard techniques such as spin coating,<br>
extrusion, codeposition, layer-by-layer assembly, or the like.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS<br>
Prior to further describing the present inventions, it may be helpful to provide a<br>
general discussion of polymers and nanoparticles.<br>
A. General<br>
The conformation of a polymer in solution is dictated by various conditions of the<br>
solution, including, for example, its interaction with the solvent, its concentration, and the<br>
concentration of other species that may be present. A polymer can undergo conformational<br>
changes, e.g., depending on the pH, ionic strength, cross-linking agents, temperature and<br>
concentration. For polyelectrolytes, at high charge density, e.g., when "monomer" units of<br>
the polymer are fully charged, an extended conformation is adopted due to electrostatic<br>
repulsion between similarly charged monomer units. Decreasing the charge density of the<br>
polymer, e.g., through addition of salts or a change of pH, can result in a transition of the<br>
extended polymer chains to a more tightly packed globular, i.e., collapsed conformation.<br>
Such a collapse transition is driven by attractive interactions between the polymer segments<br>
that overcome the electrostatic repulsion forces. Changing the solvent environment of a<br>
polymer can induce a similar transition. This collapsed polymer can be of nanoscale<br>
dimensions and a nanoparticle. This collapsed conformation can be rendered irreversible by<br>
the formation of intramolecular chemical bonds between segments of the collapsed polymer,<br>
e.g., by cross-linking.<br>
As used herein, the term "collapsed polymer" refers to an approximately globular<br>
form, generally as a spheroid, but also as an elongate and/or multi-lobed conformation<br>
collapsed polymer having nanometer dimensions.<br><br>
B. Nanoparticle Compositions<br>
In various aspects, the present inventions provide nanoparticle compositions<br>
comprising a nanoparticle having a layer of one or more stabilizer moieties. The stabilizer<br>
moieties can be chosen, e.g., for permeability to various SCEs and thus the ease or difficulty<br>
with which an SCE can reach or leave the nanoparticle can be selected. The degree to which<br>
materials are allowed to move to or from the nanoparticle surface, through the stabilizer<br>
layer, out of or into the nanoparticle environment is referred to as "permeability." Highly<br>
permeable stabilizer layers to a SCE, e.g., allow for facile movement of the SCE between the<br>
nanoparticle surface and environment, while impermeable stabilizers limit this movement. It<br>
is to be understood that permeability varies depending on the size and chemical character of<br>
the species (SCE) attempting to pass through the stabilizer layer.<br>
In various embodiments, a nanoparticle composition of the present inventions and/or<br>
formed by a method of the present inventions has a mean diameter in the range between<br>
about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 nm. In various embodiments, the composite<br>
nanoparticle has a mean diameter in one or more of the ranges between: (a) about lnm to<br>
about 10nm; (b) about 10nm to about 30nm; (c) about 15 nm to about 50 nm; and (d) about<br>
50nm to about 100nm). It is to be understood that the term "mean diameter" is not meant to<br>
imply any sort of specific symmetry (e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, etc.) of a composite<br>
nanoparticle. Rather, the composite nanoparticle could be highly irregular and asymmetric.<br>
In various practical applications of nanoparticles, nanoparticle interaction with<br>
deactivating compounds, solubility, and/or unwanted aggregation can be a problem. In<br>
various embodiments of the present inventions, nanoparticle compositions are provided<br>
having a stabilizer that provides solubility and/or prevents aggregation, but allows transport<br>
of materials from the nanoparticle environment to the nanoparticle surface and vice versa. In<br>
various versions, such embodiments can have practical application in the areas, e.g., of slow-<br>
release pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, corrosion inhibitors, and the like, where the<br>
nanoparticle comprises an active agent that is to be released. Modifications to the stabilizer<br>
layer can be used to provide nanoparticle compositions with tailored release profiles (such as,<br>
e.g., controlled release, sustained release, delayed release, etc); transport rates to the<br>
nanoparticle and/or away from the nanoparticle.<br>
For example, in various embodiments, the nanoparticle compositions comprising a<br>
stabilizer layer that allows certain SCE transport to and from the nanoparticle can be use in<br>
catalysis applications, where, e.g., the transport of chemical reagents to the nanoparticle<br><br>
surface is necessary for the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles. In various embodiments,<br>
the stabilizer layer can be chosen to have different transport properties of a SCE to the<br>
surface of a nanoparticle than the transport properties of the reaction product of the SCE,<br>
activated SCE (e.g., by catalytic activation) away from the SCE. Such differences in<br>
transport properties can be used, e.g., to control reaction rates (e.g., by transport to the<br>
catalytic surface), provide sufficient time for catalytic activation (e.g., by adjusting transport<br>
away from nanoparticle surface), etc. The control of transport to and from the nanoparticle<br>
surface of various SCE by selection and/or modification of the stabilizer can be used to adjust<br>
or control other factors of chemical processing such as the rate of gas evolution, heat build<br>
up, etc. that can be problematic in large scale chemical processing. In various embodiments,<br>
the stabilizer layer can have a dynamic aspect, e.g., the stabilizer undergoing a change or<br>
series of changes during the catalytic reaction to facilitate further downstream reactions. In<br>
various embodiments, the dynamic change can be cyclic (e.g., periodic) facilitating providing<br>
a first stabilizer layer for a first reaction, a second stabilizer layer for a second reaction (the<br>
second stabilizer formed by a modification of the first layer), followed by reversion to the<br>
first stabilizer layer for a new first reaction. It is to be understood that more than two that<br>
such cycles or series of stabilizer layers can be used, such as for example, a three-layer cycle<br>
or series , a four layer cycle or series, etc. The changes to the stabilizer layer can be<br>
initiated by compounds produced in situ and/or addition of compounds and/or external<br>
stimuli (e.g., radiation, heat, etc.).<br>
In various embodiments of the present invention, the stabilized nanoparticle,<br>
nanoparticle compositions, of the present inventions facilitate providing and/or provide<br>
improved optical properties, such as narrower emission spectra, improved fluorescence<br>
efficiency, modified fluorescence lifetimes, and the like compared to substantially similar<br>
nanoparticles without a stabilizer layer.<br>
C. Nanoparticles<br>
A wide variety of molecules can be used to form the nanoparticle including,<br>
but not limited to, organic or inorganic charged ions or a combination thereof. In various<br>
preferred embodiments, the nanoparticle comprises an elemental metal, alloy comprising a<br>
metal, or a metal species-containing compound, the metal is preferably Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ag,<br>
Mn, Ni, Au, Mg, Fe, Hg. Pt or a combination or alloy of one or more thereof. As used herein,<br>
by the term "metal species-containing compound" is meant a compound containing a metal or<br><br>
metalloid in any valence state. In various preferred embodiments, the nanoparticle comprises<br>
semiconductor crystals, including, but not limited, to CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe,<br>
PbS, PbSe, PbTe, CuI, HgS, HgSe, and HgTe. These semiconductors can be ternary or<br>
quaternary semiconductors, including, but not limited to, CdTe/S, CdSe/S, CdTe/Se,<br>
Cd/ZnTe, Cd/ZnSe/Te, and the like. In various preferred embodiments, the nanoparticle<br>
comprises oxides, such as ZnO, SnO2, CoO, NiO, CdO, InO2, and the like. In various<br>
preferred embodiments, the nanoparticle comprises more complex systems, including alloys<br>
such as Ag/Au, Ag/Cu, Au/Cu, phosphates such as LiFePO4, chromates such as PbCrO4, and<br>
the like.<br>
D. Stabilizing Moieties<br>
The nanoparticle compositions of the present inventions comprise a nanoparticle<br>
preferably surrounded by at least one stabilizer moiety. A stabilizer moiety for use in the<br>
present inventions can be any molecule capable of collapse that contains units of monomers,<br>
that can be synthetic or naturally occurring and can be linear, branched, hyperbranched,<br>
and/or dendrimeric.<br>
When considering various practical applications of the present inventions, there are<br>
three main functions of a stabilizer. One function can be to modify and/or control the<br>
interactions of the nanoparticles with each other and/or with a solvent, e.g., to provide certain<br>
solubility characteristics or to prevent aggregation. A second function can be to prevent<br>
transport of other materials dissolved in the nanoparticle environment (e.g., tissue, solvent,<br>
air, etc.) to the nanoparticle surface, which, e.g., can often cause deactivation of nanoparticle<br>
properties, such as, e.g.. fluorescence. A third function can be to prevent release of the<br>
material comprising the nanoparticle into the nanoparticle environment (e.g., tissue, solvent,<br>
air, etc.), e.g., to prevent the nanoparticle from decomposing or dissolving into its component<br>
parts, eliciting a toxic response, etc. It is to be understood that the second and third functions<br>
can apply to nanoparticles in gaseous systems as wells as those in a liquid environment.<br>
In various preferred embodiments of the present inventions, the stabilizing moiety<br>
comprises one or more polymers with ionizable or ionized groups. An ionizable moiety or<br>
group is any chemical functional group that can be rendered charged by adjusting solution<br>
conditions, while ionized moieties refers to chemical functional groups that are charged<br>
regardless of solution conditions. An ionizable moiety also includes any chemical functional<br>
group that can be rendered charged by the use of radiation or by the use of a static<br><br>
electromagnetic field. The ionized or ionizable moiety or group can be either cationic or<br>
anionic, and can be continuous along an entire chain as in the case of regular polymers, or<br>
can be interrupted by blocks containing different functional groups, as in the case of block<br>
polymers.<br>
Examples of polymer stabilizers suitable in various embodiments include, but are not<br>
limited to, polyelectrolytes such as, e.g., poly(acrylic acid), poly (styrene sulfonate),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), poIy(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), or others.<br>
Suitable examples of adsorbates include similar polyelectrolytes. In various preferred<br>
embodiments employing an adsorbate, the polymer stabilizer is of a larger molecular weight<br>
than the adsorbate moieties.<br>
In various embodiments, a preferred cationic group is the amino group and preferred<br>
anionic groups are carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, phosphates, and the like. For cationic<br>
polymers, examples include, but are not limited to, poly(allylamine), poly(ethyleneimine),<br>
poly(diallyIdimethylammonium chloride), poly(arginine), chitosan, cationic collapsible<br>
proteins, poly(methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) and poly(lysine). For<br>
anionic polymers, examples include, but are not limited to, poly(acrylic acid), poly(styrene<br>
sulfonic acid), poly(glutamic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(aspartic acid), nucleic acids,<br>
anionic collapsible proteins, poly (anetholesulfonic acid), cellulose, poly(maleic acid)<br>
poly( vinyl phosphoric acid), etc. Block polymers are made up of blocks of polymers having<br>
different functional groups. The block polymers can be made up of blocks of any of the<br>
mentioned anionic and cationic polymers and another polymer that imparts a specific<br>
desirable property to the block polymer.<br>
E. Formation of Nanoparticle Compositions &amp; Modification of Stabilizer laver<br>
In various preferred embodiments of the present inventions, a polymer-stabilized<br>
nanoparticle composition of the present inventions is produced in a suitable solvent by<br>
collapse of a stabilizer moiety about a nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor moiety. A wide<br>
variety of solvents can be used to form a solution of use in the present inventions. In various<br>
embodiments, the solution is preferably an aqueous solution.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present inventions, a chosen stabilizer moiety is<br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent to form a solution of the stabilizer. The solvent can be water,<br>
an organic solvent or a mixture of two or more such solvents. The addition to the solution of<br><br>
the collapsing agent induces a collapse of the stabilizer about the nanoparticle or nanoparticle<br>
precursor. The collapsing agent can itself be the nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor. For<br>
example, the nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor can be an inorganic salt that is water<br>
soluble where the water soluble inorganic salt is of the form MxAy where M is a metal cation<br>
belonging to Groups I to IV of the Periodic Table possessing a charge +y and A is the counter<br>
ion to M with a charge -x or a combination thereof.<br>
Various preferred embodiments of the present inventions involve the formation of<br>
composite nanoparticles by the addition of ions that induce precipitate formation of the<br>
nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor within the collapsed stabilizer, wherein the stabilizer is<br>
intra-molecularly and/or inter-molecularly cross-linked. As used herein, "precipitation" of a<br>
nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor having a stabilizer layer refers to modification of the<br>
ion to a compound that is substantially insoluble in the solvent of the solution.<br>
Collapsing agents are usually water-soluble inorganic salts, most preferably, those<br>
that contain metal cations and their corresponding anions. Examples of collapsing agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, Cd(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, Cu(SO4), Pb(NO3)2, Pb(CH3COO)2,<br>
Ag(NO3), Mn(SO4), Ni(NO3)2.<br>
A variety of techniques can be used to collapse the stabilizer around a nanoparticle or<br>
nanoparticle precursor. For example, in various embodiments a collapsing agent such as a<br>
different solvent, an ionic species (e.g., a salt); or combinations thereof can be used. In<br>
various embodiments, it is preferred that the nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor itself<br>
serve as a collapsing agent. Multiple collapsing agents can be used.<br>
In various embodiments, to retain the collapsed conformation of the stabilizer layer,<br>
cross-linking of the collapsed stabilizer is achieved by exposing the polymer to y-radiation or<br>
UV radiation. Preferably, the UV radiation is UV laser radiation or UV arc lamp radiation.<br>
In various embodiments, intra-molecular cross-links are chemically produced, for example,<br>
with carbodiimide chemistry with a homobifunctional cross-linker.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polymer stabilizer moiety or moieties are at least<br>
partially crosslinked so that the favorable solubility and non-aggregative properties of the<br>
nanoparticle composition are maintained. In various embodiments, the stabilizer layer is<br>
stabilized by inter-molecular crosslinks to form a gel.<br><br>
1. Crosslinking in General<br>
The polymer stabilizer is preferably chosen to be susceptible to chemical or physical<br>
crosslinking. In various embodiments, control of the permeability of the stabilizer to SCEs,<br>
e.g., modification of the stabilizer layer, is achieved through control of the degree of<br>
crosslinking of the stabilizing polymer. For example, by increasing the degree of chemical<br>
crosslinking, the permeability of the stabilizer to SCEs can be decreased.<br>
A wide variety of means can be used to cross-link the stabilizer layer, for example:<br>
chemical means through radical reactions of pendant groups containing unsaturated bonds;<br>
through the use of molecules having multifunctional groups than can react with the functional<br>
groups of the stabilizer moeity;; though high-energy radiation, such as, e.g., gamma radiation.<br>
Crosslinking can be achieved through chemical means through introduction of<br>
multidentate molecules as crosslinkers. These molecules contain multiple functional groups<br>
that can form covalent bonds with the functional groups on the stabilizer moieties. These<br>
molecules can be linear, branched, or dendrimeric. For example, a molecule containing<br>
multiple amine groups, such as 2,2,-ethylenedioxydiethylamine can effect the intramolecular<br>
crosslinking of poly(acrylic acid). The cross-linking reaction in this case can be promoted by<br>
the addition of an activating agent, typically used for amide bond formation, such as a<br>
carbodiimide.<br>
Chemical treatment can also be carried out to derivatize the stabilizer layer, such that<br>
a fraction of the ionizable groups are converted to groups that can be cross-linked through<br>
free-radical reactions. An example is to convert some of the carboxylic acid groups of<br>
poly(acrylic acid) to allyl esters. The allyl groups can then be reacted to form intramolecular<br>
bonds through radical chemistry.<br>
Crosslinking by irradiation can be effected by exposing a solution of the collapsed<br>
stabilizer to an electromagnetic radiation source. The radiation source can be, for example,<br>
an excimer laser, a mercury arc lamp, a light emitting diode, a UV germicidal lamp or gamma<br>
rays. For the purposes of this specification, crosslinking through means such as irradiation<br>
shall be referred to as "physical crosslinking."<br>
The degree of chemical cross-linking can be controlled by controlling the relative<br>
concentration of multidentate molecules, activating agents, or other reactive groups. The<br>
degree of physical cross-linking can be controlled by controlling the dose, wavelength, or<br>
type of radiation to which the polymer-stabilized nanoparticles are exposed.<br><br>
2. Stabilizing Loyer Modifications<br>
In various aspects, the present inventions also provide methods to modify the<br>
properties of the stabilizer so that, in various embodiments, nanoparticles compositions<br>
having stabilizers with specific desired transport properties of material to and/or from the<br>
nanoparticle environment to and/or from the nanoparticle surface, and vice versa, can be<br>
produced.<br>
In various preferred embodiments, the step modifying a stabilizer layers occurs after<br>
collapse of the stabilizer moieties about a nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor but prior to<br>
cross-linking of the stabilizer layer; substantially during or concurrent with cross-linking of<br>
the stabilizer layer; after cross-linking of the stabilizer layer; or a combination of one or more<br>
of prior to, during, concurrently and after cross-linking of the stabilizer layer.<br>
In various embodiments, selection of the permeability and/or other properties of the<br>
stabilizer layer are provide for by selecting the degree of intra-molecular and/or<br>
intermolecular cross-linking of the stabilizer moieties. Figure 1 schematically depicts a<br>
nanoparticle composition (102) comprising a nanoparticle (NP), or nanoparticle precursor,<br>
and a stabilizer moiety layer (104). Figure 1 illustrates that increasing the degree of intra-<br>
molecular cross-linking (106) of the stabilizing moieties (situation A) decreases the<br>
permeability of the stabilizer layer to a SCE (108), whereas decreasing the degree of intra-<br>
molecular cross-linking (situation B) increase the permeability of the layer.<br>
In various embodiments of the present inventions, a polymer-stabilized nanoparticle is<br>
provided in a suitable solvent. The polymer stabilizer moieties are chosen to have a three-<br>
dimensional structure that is sensitive to solution conditions such as pH, temperature, solvent,<br>
ionic strength, etc. Non-limiting examples of such polymers are polymers with ionizable<br>
groups, where interactions between these ionizable groups can control the three-dimensional<br>
structure of the polymer. In various versions of c=such embodiments, control of the<br>
permeability of the stabilizer to SCEs can be achieved, through control of the three-<br>
dimensional structure using changes in solution conditions. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
polymer stabilizer moiety or moieties are at least partially crosslinked so that the favorable<br>
solubility and non-aggregative properties of the nanoparticle composition are maintained.<br>
Changes in the three-dimensional structure of ionized or ionizable polymers can be<br>
effected, e.g., using changes in pH, temperature, solvent, ionic strength, etc. Normally in<br>
solution, at high charge density, e.g., when "monomer" units of the stabilizer polymer are<br><br>
fully or highly charged, an extended conformation is adopted due to electrostatic repulsion<br>
between similarly charged monomer units. Decreasing the charge density of the polymer,<br>
which can be effected through addition of salts or a change of pH, can result in the transition<br>
of extended polymer chains to a collapsed conformation. If, instead of being able to freely<br>
interact with the solution, the polymer is in a non-extended conformation, changes in charge<br>
density on the polymer can result in swelling or contraction of the polymer. The non-<br>
extended conformation can occur even at high charge density if, for example, the polymer has<br>
formed a collapsed conformation and was then internally crosslinked chemically or<br>
physically. For example, even if the initial cause of collapse is removed the polymer may<br>
retain its basic collapsed shape, though it may swell or contract depending on conditions.<br>
This can also occur if the polymer is externally crosslinked with other polymers (inter-<br>
molecular crosslinking), e.g., forming a gel. Cross-linking the stabilizer layer (both by intra-<br>
molecular and/or inter-molecular crosslinking) can provide to a polymer system with a<br>
substantially inflexible shape. Where one or more stabilizer layers have a substantially<br>
inflexible shape, increases in charge density can lead to repulsion between the monomers of<br>
the stabilizer polymers. Since the polymers are not able to adopt an extended conformation,<br>
they will instead swell, substantially maintaining the shape of the layer but increasing in<br>
porosity. Similarly, decreases in charge density can lead to a reduction in repulsive<br>
interactions of the monomers of the polymers, leading to contraction of the stabilizer layer.<br>
Contraction or swelling of the polymer stabilizer layer can be similarly effected by<br>
changing solvent conditions. For example, replacement of a first solvent with a second<br>
solvent with which the polymer has decreased favorable interactions with will encourage<br>
contraction of the polymer stabilizer. Similarly, replacement of a first solvent with a second<br>
solvent with which the polymer has increased favorable interactions will encourage swelling<br>
of the polymer stabilizer. In various versions of these embodiments, suitable stabilizers<br>
include polymers stabilizers that have ionizable groups and dissimilar interactions with<br>
different solvents. In various preferred embodiments, the polymer stabilizer is soluble in<br>
both the first and second solvents in order to maintain favorable solubility and non-<br>
aggregative properties of the stabilized nanoparticle.<br>
Examples of suitable solvent systems include, but are not limited to, water-soluble<br>
polymers where the first solvent is aqueous and the second solvent is a combination of water<br>
and ethanol; alcohol-soluble polymers where the first solvent is a small-chain alcohol and the<br>
second solvent is a longer-chain alcohol and the like.<br><br>
Modification of the three-dimensional structure of the polymer stabilizer, e.g., by<br>
swelling or contraction of the polymer can be used to change the permeability of the polymer<br>
stabilizer to SCEs. For example, Figure 2 schematically depicts a nanoparticle composition<br>
(202) comprising a nanoparticle (NP) or nanoparticle precursor, and a stabilizer moiety layer<br>
(204). Figure 2 illustrates that that less favorable interaction of the stabilizing moieties of the<br>
layer (204) with the solvent (situation A) can result in contraction of the stabilizer moiety<br>
layer (206) and reduce permeability to a SCE (208). A composition with a more favorable<br>
interaction of the stabilizing moieties with the solvent (situation B) resulting in expansion of<br>
the stabilizer moiety layer (210) and an increased permeability to a SCE (208).<br>
Suitable means to modify the stabilizer to change its permeability to SCEs also<br>
include methods to modify stabilizing moieties to increase or decrease the size of the<br>
stabilizing moieties. The means can include, e.g., physical or chemical absorption or<br>
desorption of additional chemical entities (e.g., adsorbates), which can be polymers, ligands,<br>
coordinating complexes, or combinations thereof. The means can further comprise a<br>
chemical reaction to assist in the adsorption or desorption process. For example, in various<br>
embodiments, the stabilizing moiety is further functionalized to improve compatibility with<br>
the further adsorbed species. In various embodiments, this adsorption or desorption process<br>
occurs subsequent to the production of a stabilized nanoparticle, during the production of a<br>
stabilized nanoparticle, or both.<br>
For example, in various embodiments, an adsorbate moiety is added to a polymer-<br>
stabilized nanoparticle while the polymer-stabilized nanoparticle is being synthesized. In<br>
various preferred embodiments, the polymer stabilizer is a polymer with ionizable groups,<br>
e.g., a polyelectrolyte, and the nanoparticle is formed using a collapse transition of the<br>
polyelectrolyte. The adsorbate moiety is added to the solution prior to the collapse transition,<br>
subsequent to the collapse transition, or both, and interacts with the collapsed polyelectrolyte.<br>
In various preferred embodiments, the adsorbate is a lower molecular-weight polyelectrolyte<br>
than the polymer stabilizer. As a non-limiting example, low molecular weight PAA or PAH<br>
can be added to a polymer solution of large molecular weight PAA prior to collapse and<br>
formation of a nanoparticle having a stabilizer layer. The low molecular weight<br>
polyelectrolyte can interact with the polymer stabilizer to decrease the permeability of the<br>
stabilizer layer to SCEs.<br>
In various embodiments of the present inventions, a polymer-stabilized nanoparticle is<br>
provided in a suitable solvent. Subsequent treatment of the polymer-stabilized nanoparticle<br><br>
with an adsorbate moiety results in a thicker or denser polymer-adsorbate composite<br>
stabilizer layer. This adsorbate, can be chemically and/or physically adsorbed to the polymer<br>
stabilizer, e.g., the adsorbate can be covalently bound to the polymer stabilizer, physisorbed,<br>
etc.. The polymer-adsorbate composite stabilizer can decrease the permeability of the<br>
stabilizer layer to SCEs.<br>
In various embodiments, a stabilizer layer of a polymer-stabilized nanoparticle<br>
comprises a component that can be desorbed or cleaved from the polymer stabilizer, resulting<br>
in a sterically less thick or dense polymer stabilizer layer with increased permeability to<br>
SCEs.<br>
For example. Figure 3 schematically depicts the modification of a nanoparticle<br>
composition (302) comprising a nanoparticle (NP) or nanoparticle precursor, and a stabilizer<br>
moiety layer (304). Addition of an adsorbate moiety (306), e.g., by functionalization,<br>
adsorption, absorption, cleavage, etc., can be used to modify the stabilizer layer (situation A)<br>
and reduce permeability to a SCE (308) as compared to a substantially similar stabilizer layer<br>
without an adsorbate (situation B).<br>
In various embodiments, the adsorbate moiety has one or more functional groups that<br>
can be used for conjugating the stabilized nanoparticles to other molecules containing<br>
complementary functional groups. Examples of such molecules include, but are not limited<br>
to, protein, ligand, oligonucleotide, aptamer, carbohydrate, lipid, other nanoparticles, any<br>
member of affinity-binding pairs (such as, e.g., antigen-antibody, DNA-protein, DNA-DNA,<br>
DNA-RNA, biotin-avidin, hapten-antihapten, protein-protein, enzyme-substrate), and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In various embodiments, at least portion of the functional groups of the adsorbate<br>
moiety can be modified to convert them to other functional groups that can be used, e.g., for<br>
conjugation. For example, a hetero bi-functional molecule containing an amine group and a<br>
latent thiol group can be reacted with poly (acrylic acid)-adsorbed nanoparticles through<br>
amide bond formation thereby converting the carboxylic acid to a thiol group. The thiol<br>
group can be used, e.g., for conjugation to other molecules containing thiol-reactive groups.<br>
In various embodiments, in addition to modifying the thickness or density of the<br>
polymer-adsorbate stabilizer layer the adsorbate can modify the chemical properties of the<br>
polymer-adsorbate stabilizer. In various embodiments, this can be used to enhance or retard<br>
changes to the permeability of the stabilizer layer to SCEs caused by the changes in the<br>
thickness or density of the polymer-adsorbate stabilizer. For example, a polymer-adsorbate<br><br>
stabilizer having a different net charge than the polymer stabilizer alone, would modify the<br>
net charge and thereby can be used to modify the permeability of the stabilizer layer to<br>
charged SCEs.<br>
In various preferred aspects, the stabilizer layer is composed of one or more bilayers.<br>
For example, in various preferred embodiments, a polymer-stabilized nanoparticle is<br>
provided in a suitable solvent. The polymer stabilizer is one or more polymer moieties with<br>
ionizable groups where at least some of the ionizable groups are partially or completely<br>
ionized. The presence of the ionized groups gives the polymer stabilizer a net charge, e.g.,<br>
positive or negative. Addition of a polymer or other adsorbate with opposite charge can<br>
result in adsoption of the adsorbate to the initial polymer stabilizer layer, resulting in a<br>
polymer-adsorbate stabilizer. This process can be continued in a so-called "layer-by-layer"<br>
fashion, where layers of adsorbates of opposite charge are added alternately. A pair of<br>
moieties (e.g., adsorbates, stabilizers, etc.) that are subsequently added of opposite charge is<br>
referred to herein as a bilayer.<br>
In various embodiments of the present inventions, individual layers of stabilizer<br>
moiety and adsorbed polymer stabilizing layer can be crosslinked together using radiation,<br>
chemically, or by heating. High energy radiation in the form of UV lamps, gamma<br>
irradiation, particulate radiation, and the like can be used to generate free radicals to<br>
participate in a cross-linking process. In various embodiments, bifunctional ligands such as<br>
EDC can be used to covalently bond carboxylate groups from adjacent layers together. In<br>
various embodiments, heating can be used to generate crosslinks between two layers of<br>
stabilizing polymers. An example of this process would be where the first layer contains<br>
carboxylate groups and the second layer contains amine groups, where heating promotes the<br>
formation of an amide covalent bond between the two layers.<br>
For example. Figure 4 illustrates various embodiments of a "layer-by-layer"<br>
assembly. A nanoparticle composition (402) comprising a nanoparticle (NP) or nanoparticle<br>
precursor, and a stabilizer moiety layer (404) having a net charge, is contacted with another<br>
stabilizer moiety or adsorbate (406), with an opposite net charge, (step 1) to form a new<br>
nanoparticle composition (408). The steps can be repeated, a stabilizer moiety or adsorbate<br>
moiety being added (410) of net charge opposite to the proceeding moiety (406) to assemble<br>
additional layers (e.g., full or partial bilayers of polyelectrolytes) on the stabilized<br>
nanoparticle (402).<br><br>
F.	Permeability<br>
The permeability of a stabilizer layer can be ascertained by a number of methods. For<br>
example, a stabilized nanoparticle can be added to an etchant (e.g., HC1 for CdS) and the rate<br>
of dissolution measured, the rate of dissolution being be proportional to the rate of H+ in and<br>
Cd out, which can be monitored, e.g., by watching the intensity and position of a fluorescence<br>
peak of CdS. Another method involves measuring the rate of dissolution/leaching of a metal<br>
nanoparticle from the stabilized nanoparticle into solution as a cationic metal (and thus<br>
outside the stabilizer layer), e.g., as in bioavailability studies. Another approach is to monitor<br>
a property of the nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor during collapse and/or modification<br>
of the stabilizer moiety in the presence of a compound that deactivates a property<br>
nanoparticle or nanoparticle precursor, e.g., example, monitoring CdS fluorescence in the<br>
presence of EDTA, a deactivator of CdS fluorescence.<br>
G.	Catalytic Supports<br>
In various aspects, the present inventions provide stabilized nanoparticles supported<br>
by a substrate. In various embodiments, supported, stabilized nanoparticles can be used, e.g.,<br>
in heterogeneous processes where supported nanoparticles interact with gas- and/or liquid-<br>
borne SCEs, such as, for example, in heterogenous catalysis. For example, in various<br>
embodiments, stabilized nanoparticles are supported on the substrate (e.g., activated carbon),<br>
on the surfaces of the pores of a mesoporous material, or a combination thereof, for catalysis<br>
of gas and/or liquid-borne SCEs . Examples of mesoporous materials include, but are not<br>
limited to, zeolitic materials, aluminosilicates, clays, and other porous silicates.<br>
A wide variety of substrates can be used as supports, and include any solid phase<br>
material upon which a stabilized nanoparticle can be immobilized. Examples of substrate<br>
materials include, but are not limited to, activated carbon, mesoporous materials, zeolites,<br>
organic polymers, inorganic surfaces, such as, e.g., glass, controlled pore glass, silica, metals,<br>
alloys, etc., and combinations thereof. The support can have a variety of forms and form<br>
factors, including, but not limited to, beads, spheres, particles, granules, gels, membranes,<br>
surfaces. Surfaces can be a variety of shapes, including, but not limited to, planar,<br>
substantially planar, or non-planar. Supports can be porous, non-porous or a combination of<br>
both, and can have swelling and/or non-swelling characteristics.<br><br>
In various preferred embodiments, a "Iayer-by-layer" assembly process as described<br>
herein, such as, for example, in section F, can be used to fashion supported, stabilized<br>
nanoparticles. For example, in various preferred embodiments, a polymer-stabilized<br>
nanoparticle is provided in a suitable solvent. The polymer stabilizer comprising one or more<br>
polymer moieties with ionizable groups where at least some of the ionizable groups are<br>
partially or completely ionized. The presence of the ionized groups can give the polymer<br>
stabilizer a net charge, e.g., positive or negative. A substrate with a net surface charge of<br>
opposite character can be exposed to a solution of these nanoparticles which can result in<br>
absorption of nanoparticles to the surface. Addition of a polymer, stabilized nanoparticle,<br>
bare nanoparticle, or other adsorbate with opposite charge can result in adsorption of the<br>
adsorbate to the initial stabilized nanoparticle layer. The process can be continued in a so-<br>
called "layer-by-layer" fashion, where layers of adsorbates of opposite charge can be added<br>
alternately. A pair of moieties (e.g., adsorbates, stabilizers, etc.), where one member of the<br>
pair has a net positive charge and the other a net negative charge, can together be referred to<br>
herein as a bilayer.<br>
In various embodiments, each bilayer can comprise stabilized nanoparticles of the<br>
appropriate charge in one and/or both of the layers, which, for example, can be used to<br>
modify the loading of stabilized nanoparticle in the layered substrate. In various<br>
embodiments, one or more of the bilayers does not comprise and/or is substantially free of<br>
nanoparticles, for example, to decrease the loading of nanoparticles in the layered substrate.<br>
The porosity of the layered substrate can be modified, for example, by changing<br>
solution conditions during deposition such as pH, ionic strength, solvent, concentrations, etc.<br>
Increased porosity facilitates improving the diffusion of materials through the layered<br>
substrate, while decreased porosity can, e.g., increase the strength of coordination and barrier<br>
effects.<br>
In various embodiments, the layered substrate is loaded with stabilized nanoparticles<br>
with specific catalytic activity such as metals, metal alloys, oxides, and the like. In various<br>
embodiments, the stabilizers have increased or decreased porosity to SCEs.<br>
In various embodiments, a layered substrate comprising nanoparticles is sintered in a<br>
furnace in order to enhance interconnectivity of the nanoparticles and/or burn off stabilizer<br>
and/or other adsorbate moieties. This can result, e.g., in a porous substrate comprising at<br>
least one type of nanoparticle. In various embodiments, this porous substrate is used as a<br><br>
catalyst. In various embodiments the porous substrate comprises an oxide. In various<br>
embodiments the porous substrate comprises, a porous oxide that can, e.g., act as a Lewis<br>
base in a catalytic reaction.<br>

in light of the following examples, which are not exhaustive and which should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present inventions in any way.<br>

solution (1.67 mM Cd, irradiated for lh with 254 nm light) was put into a one-necked round<br>
bottom flask (rbf). Trisodium citrate (50 mg) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 25 mg) was<br>
added in one portion to the stirred Cd-PAA solution. 1.25 mL Na2TeO3 solution, prepared<br>
above, was added to the Cd-PAA solution. A condenser was put on rbf and the reaction<br>
mixture was heated to reflux in the heating mantle and lef to reflux for 4h. Meanwhile,<br>
another heating mantle was preheated to 50 °C. After 4 h of reflux, the reaction flask was<br>

room temperature. The fluorescence of the yellow and orange quantum dots with 5% and<br>
25% PSS are shown in Figures 10 and 11 respectively.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of CdTe-CdS nanoparticles coated with bilavers of polvelectrolytes<br>
Samples of quantum dots coated with 1, 2. or 3 bilayers of PAA and PAH were<br>
prepared. The green CdTe-CdS quantum dots with a PAA stabilizer were prepared according<br>
to Example 2, purified by precipitation with ethanol, and reconstituted at 16 times its original<br>
concentration (on a solids basis). It was then diluted 333 times with deionized, distilled water<br>
(ddH20). To 100µL of this solution was added alternately solutions of PAH (MW=15,000,<br>
40 µL, 0.03 mg/mL) and PAA-Na (MW = 2,100, 5µL, 0.3 mg/mL). After each addition, the<br>
mixture was put on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes and then the next solution was added.<br>
For CdTe-CdS nanoparticles with one bilayer (i.e. after one alternate addition of PAH<br>
and PAA-Na), after one alternate addition of PAH and PAA-Na the solution was removed<br>
from the shaker and 90 uL of deionized, distilled water was added. For CdTe-CdS<br>
nanoparticles with two bilayers, after two alternate additions of PAH and PAA-Na the<br>
solution was removed from the shaker and 45 uL of ddH20 was added. For CdTe-CdS<br><br>

solution was removed from the shaker and used.<br>
Example 4: Polyelectrolyte stabilizer effect on CdTe-CdS quantum dot photoluminescence<br>
Two sets of samples of quantum dots were prepared using a modified version of<br>
example 1. In this case, the green CdTe-CdS quantum dots were prepared according to<br>
Example 1 and diluted 10 times. The amounts of PAH and PAA-Na added were also<br>
modified - each bilayer involved the addition of 10µL of each solution at concentrations of<br>
0.5 mg/mL and 0.05 mg/mL respectivelly.<br>
One set of quantum dots was exposed to high intensity UV radiation (254 nm) for 30<br>
minutes while another set was kept covered with aluminum foil tape. The photoluminescence<br>
spectra are shown in Figure 5. As control, two sets of solutions of quantum dots without<br>
bilayers of PAH and PAA-Na were prepared and diluted 10 times; one set was exposed to<br>
high intensity UV radiation (254 urn) for 30 minutes while another set was kept covered with<br>
aluminum foil tape. The photoluminescence spectra are shown in Figure 6.<br>
Example 5: Effect of crosslinking on CdS quantum dot photoluminescence<br>
Cd2+/PAA was prepared by mixing equal volumes of aqueous 2 mg/mL Polyacrylic<br>
acid (1.2 million MW, Sigma) with 3.3 mM Cd(NO3)2. Briefly, 10.0 mL of the polyacrylic<br>
acid solution was placed in a plastic beaker with 10 mL of water and stirred vigorously with a<br>
magnetic stir bar. To this solution, 90 mL of polyacrylic acid solution along with 90 ml of<br>
Cd(NO3)2 were added dropwise at a rate of 5 ml/minute under vigorous stirring. To the<br>
resulting solution, 10 more ml of Cd(NO3)2 was added dropwise at a rate of 2-3 ml/min with<br>
vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was a clear liquid.<br>
The Cd2+/PAA was crosslinked under a UV Germicidal lamp and aliquots at different<br>
crosslinking times were taken (0 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hrs, and 2 hrs). CdS/PAA was<br>
made using Cd2+/PAA (crosslinked at different times) - 180 µL of 2.8 mM Na2S solution was<br>
added to 500 µL of Cd2+/PAA solution. The resulting UV visible and emission spectra is<br>
shown in Figure 7 for CdS/PAA formed using Cd2+/PAA that was crosslinked at different<br>
times (0 hours, 30 mins., 1 hour, and 2 hours).<br><br>
Example 6: Photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles.<br>
100UL of methylene blue solution (0.1 mM) was added to two separate solutions<br>
containing 100uL of ZnO nanoparticles with a PAA stabilizer (0.5 mg/mL based on PAA<br>
concentration). The ZnO nanoparticles were prepared as described in Goh et al., PCT<br>
application CD 2006/001686. Two control solutions were also made with 100 uL of ddH20<br>
and 100 µL of methylene blue solution. The solutions were kept in the dark.<br>
After 3.5 hours, one solution with ZnO nanoparticles and one without was exposed to<br>
UV radiation (302 nm) and the other solutions were kept covered with aluminum foil.<br>
Absorbance measurements were taken after 5. 30, 60, and 189 minutes and are shown in<br>
Figure 8. In the absence of ZnO nanoparticles little decrease in absorbance was observed,<br>
and accelerated breakdown was shown for methylene blue in the presence of ZnO.<br>
Example 7: Measurement of cadmium content in unbound form for stabilized CdTe-CdS<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
Green CdTe-CdS nanoparticles with 1, 2, and 3 bilayers of PAH and PAA were<br>
prepared as described in Example 1. A control solution of CdTe-CdS nanoparticles with 0<br>
bilayers was also prepared by adding 135 uL to 100 µL of the diluted CdTe-CdS solution. A<br>
control solution of polyelectrolytes was also prepared by alternately adding 3 times 40 µL of<br>
PAH and 40 µL of PAA-Na to 100 µL of ddH20 with 5 minutes shaking on an orbital<br>
