CATALYTIC   SYSTEM  FOR ALDOL  REACTIONS<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to tlie field of organic synthesis and more precisely to a single step process for the synthesis of an enone (I):<br>
0<br>
R2/ANS^HR3	(I)<br>
R1<br>
as defined further below.<br>
Said process consists in a catalyzed aldol condensation which do not require the pre-formation of an enolate. The catalytic system is also an object of the invention.<br>
Prior art<br>
Cross-aldol condensations involving "low reactivity" ketones, i.e. which need strong reaction conditions to react, and/or "high reactivity" aldehydes, i.e. which undergo self-condensation or polymerization even with soft reaction conditions, are difficult processes as, in general, important amounts of strong bases are required and/or the self-condensation or the polymerization of the aldehyde or of the final enone are frequently observed.<br>
An example of existing process for the cross-aldol condensation between a stericaly hindered cyclohexylethanone, a "low reactivity"-ketone, and acetaldehyde,-a "high reactivity" aldehyde, is the one described in Ayyar et al. J. Chem. Soc, Prekin Trans. 1,1975,17, Mil. However, said method needs the use of a stoechiometric amount of a strong base such as the N-methylanilinomagnesium bromide for the formation of an enolate. Strong bases such as an amide anion have the inconvenience of being expensive and difficult to manipulate, therefore a process implying large amounts of said base does<br><br><br><br>
/<br>
not represent the best solution for this type of reaction, all the more for an industrial purpose.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, the present invention relates to a new, single step, aldol condensation process, which does not require the pre-formation of an enolate. Said process is catalyzed by an original catalytic system including a metal l(o     complex and a co-ingredient.<br>
One of the objects of the invention is a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein the wavy line indicates that the stereochemistry of the C=C double bond is not defined;<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
R2 represents a methyl or ethyl group or a saturated or unsaturated gem-dimethyl C6 ring, possibly substituted, provided that if R1 is a hydrogen atom R2 is a group having at least two carbon atoms; or said R1 and R2 taken together form a saturated, or unsaturated gem-dimethyl C6 ring, possibly substituted, or a saturated or unsaturated C(2 ring, said ring including the carbon atom of the carbonyl function and the carbon atom to which R1 is bonded;and       R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1to C4 linearor branched 'alkyl 'or alkenyl group, a linear or branched C9 alkadienyl radical, or a CH2R group, R being a saturated or unsaturated gem-dimethyl C5 ring possibly substituted; characterized in that a starting ketone of formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(II)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 have the same meaning as in formula (I), is reacted with an aldehyde of formula<br>
  (III)<br>
wherein R3 has the same meaning as in formula (I),<br>
in the presence of a catalytic system.<br>
	Possible substituents of the groups represented by R1, R2, and R3 are methyl, ethyl,<br>
methylene or ethylene groups.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention the process is aimed at the aldol condensation between a ketone of formula (II) selected from the group consisting of the gem-dimethyl-cyclohexanones, such as 2,2-dimethyl-cyclohexanone, the gem-dimethyl-        cyclohexenones, such as 4,4-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-l-one, and the cyclododecanone, and an aldehyde of formula (Til) selected from the group consisting of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 2-propenal and 2-butenal, in order to obtain the corresponding enone of formula (I).<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention the ketone of formula (II) is methyl ethyl        ketone. Particular example of this embodiment may be the reaction between the campholenic aldehyde, i.e. 2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cycIopentene-l-acetaldehyde, and the methyl ethyl ketone.<br>
In the processes according to the second embodiment, the enone of formula (I) is<br>
obtained as a mixture of two isomers, i.e a linear one (R1 = H, R2 = Et) or a branched one<br>
       (R1 and R2 = Me). In the processes according to the present embodiment, the main isomer<br>
obtained is the branched one, in opposition to the classical aldol reaction involving the<br>
formation of enolates.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In a third, and preferred, embodiment of the invention the process consists in the reaction between a ketone of formula (IV) and an aldehyde of formula (V) to obtain an enone of formula (VI), according to Scheme 1.<br>

catalytic system<br>
+ <br>
(V)<br>
wherein the wavy line indicates that the stereochemistry of the C=C double bond is not      defined and the dotted lines indicate a single or a double bond;<br>
R4 and R5 represent, simultaneously or independently, a hydrogen atom or a methyl, ethyl<br>
methylene or ethylidene group;<br>
R6 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and<br>
R7 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1 to C4 linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group.<br>
	The ketone (IV) may be in the form of a mixture of isomers, i.e compounds having<br>
the same carbon skeleton but with one or two carbon-carbon double bonds in different<br>
positions, such as a mixture of at least two of l-(2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-l-yl)-l-<br>
ethanone, 1 -(2,2-dimethyl~6-rriethylene-l-cyclohexyl)-l-ethanone, l-(2,656-trimethy]-l -<br>
cyclohexen-l-yl)-l-ethanone and l-(2,6,6-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-l-yl)-l -ethanone, or a<br>
mixture of at least two of l-(2,6,6-trimethyl-l,3-cyclohexadien-l-yl)-l-ethanone5 1-<br>

Preferably, R4 represents a methyl or methylene group, R5 represents a hydrogen or a methyl or methylene group, R6 represents a hydrogen atom and R7 represents a methyl group.<br>
Preferred starting aldehyde (V) is acetaldehyde, and preferred starting ketone (IV) is selected from the group consisting of l-(256,6-trimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)-l-ethanone,<br><br><br><br>

ethanone, l-(2,5,6,6-tetramethyl-l-cyclohexyl)-1 -ethanone and l-(2,2,6-trimethyl-3-methylene-1 -cyclohexyl)-1 -ethanone.<br>
As mentioned above, the process of the invention needs a catalytic system. Said<br>
catalytic system is also an object of the invention. By "catalytic system" it is intended a<br>
mixture consisting of a metal complex and of a co-ingredient. The metal complex is used<br>
in substoechiometric, or catalytic amounts, relative to the starting aldehyde or ketone,<br>
lb	The metal complex has a general formula:<br>
M(OR8)4nXn	(VII)<br>
wherein M is a tetravalent metal cation selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr and Hf, R8 represents a C1-6 linear or branched alkyl group, X represents an halide such as a CI or F atom, and the index n represents an integer from 1 to 3. Preferably, M represents Ti(IV) or Zr(IV), Rs represents a linear or branched C1-4 alkyl group, X represents a CI atom and the index n represents 2 or 3.<br>
The use of a mixture of metal complexes of formula (VII) is also convenient,          especially if the catalyst is synthesized in situ, and without purification, prior to its use in the process.<br>
The co-ingredient of the catalytic system is an alkyl or aromatic carboxylic acid anhydride containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, BF3 or an anhydrous salt selected from the group consisting of the sulfates, chlorides and bromides of a metal cation, said metal 2J5 cation being selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe3+ and Al3+. Preferably, the co-ingredient is selected from the group consisting of acetic, propionic or butyric anhydride, BF3, the anhydrous Na2SO4 or K2S04 and an anhydrous chloride or bromide of Mg2+, Fe3+ or Zn2+.<br>
The use of a mixture of two or three co-ingredients is also possible. The process of the invention is advantageously performed in the presence of an excess, i.e. more that one molar equivalent, of starting ketone, relative to the starting aldehyde.<br><br><br>
The metal complex can  added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting examples, one can cite catalyst concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 0.20 molar equivalents, relative to the molar amount of the starting aldehyde (III) or (V). Preferably, the metal complex concentration will be comprised between 0.01 and 0.15 molar equivalents. It goes without saying that the optimum concentration of catalyst will depend on the nature of the latter and on the desired reaction time.<br>
The co-ingredient can be added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting examples, one can cite salt concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.2 molar equivalents, relative the number of moles of the starting aldehyde (III) or (V). Preferably, the salt concentration will be comprised between 0.15 and 1 molar equivalent. Yet, in another preferred embodiment the salt concentration will be comprised between 0.20 and 0.6 molar equivalents. It goes without saying that the optimum concentration of die additional aent will depend on the nature of the latter.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvent, but in any case it is advantageously performed in anhydrous conditions, wherein by "anhydrous" it is meant hefe a solvent which has a content in water below 1% by weight, preferably below 0.1%, When a solvent is required, it is possible to use a pure solvent or a mixture of solvents. Said solvent must be chemically compatible with the reaction conditions, i.e. not interfere with the reaction, and not deactivate die catalyst, e.g. a weak or non-coordinating solvent. Preferred solvents for the process of the invention have a boiling point higher than 60°C and are selected from the group consisting of ethers, esters, aromatic solvents, and linear or branched or cyclic hydrocarbons. More preferably, the solvent is toluene or an ether or ester with a boiling point higher than 80°C.<br>
The temperature at which the process of the invention can be carried out is comprised between 60°C and l40°C, preferably between 70°C and 110°C. Of course a person skilled in the art is also able to select the reaction temperature as a function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products and/or the possible solvent.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of me following examples, the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded with a 360MHz machine in CDCl^, the chemical displacement 5 are<br><br><br>
indicated in ppm with respect to the TMS as standard, the coupling constant J are expressed in Hz and all the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br><br><br><br>

solution.<br>
A catalytic solution containing the TiCl3(0'Pr) complex is obtained according to the<br>
procedure described in E.V. Vedejs et al, J. Org. Chem., (1988), 53, 1593 but using the       TiCl4 and the Ti(0'Pr)4 complexes as starting materials. The quantities were modified in<br>

In a 250 ml flask were added 30 g (0.18 mole) of l-(2,6,6-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-l-yl)-2-ethanone (94% purity), 12.0 g of butyl acetate, an aliquot according to Table 1 of the catalytic solution as prepared above and a quantity of Go-ingredient according to Table 1. The resulting mixture was stirred at 100°C. To said mixture, 4.0 g (0.09 mole) of       acetaldehyde, diluted in 10 g of butyl acetate were introduced under the surface of the liquid, over 3 hours. After the completion of the introduction the reaction was cooled to 35°C. To the cooled reaction medium were added 10 g of acetic acid and then 40 ml of water. After stirring a few minutes, the water phase was removed and the organic phase       was neutralised by washing it with 25 g of 20% aqueous potassium carbonate,       Finally, the butyl acetate was removed by distillation at 130-140°C under ambient pressure and the crude product thus obtained was purified by distillation on a "Vigreux" column to recover the unreacted starting ketone and the final  l-(2,6,6-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-l-yl)-2-butenrl-one.  The product presented the analytical characteristics described in the literature (i.e. as in US 4,211,242). 1.<br>

General procedure for the aldol condensation between different substrates<br>
10 In a typical procedure, the co-ingredient and the catalyst (preparation and solution molarity: see Example 1) were charged in the flask containing the ketone and the solvent, then stirred vigorously and heated. The aldehyde (1 eq.) was added under the surface of the liquid over 3-5 hours (pure or in solution). Afterwards, the reaction mixture was cooled to 30°C and diluted acetic acid was added (10% in water) under stirring. After 15 minutes, the water phase was removed and the organic phase neutralised by washing<br>
with diluted potassium carbonate (20% in water).<br>
The organic product was concentrated under vacuum and the resulting crude product<br>
purified by distillation on a "Vigreux" column to recover the unreacted starting ketone<br>
and the corresponding product. 2d     All the exact experimental conditions as well as the final yields of the product are<br>
