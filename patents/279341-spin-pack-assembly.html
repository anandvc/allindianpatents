				<td>SPIN PACK ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The present invention relates to devices and methods for use in melt spinning<br>
of elastomeric fibers, such as polyurethane fibers. Exemplary embodiments relate to a<br>
spin pack assembly used to produce such fibers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       The vast majority of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers are made by a<br>
dry spinning process involving dissolving the TPU in a solvent. Melt spinning TPU<br>
fibers has been gaining in use in recent years. Melt spinning does not involve the use of<br>
a solvent, and therefore is more environmentally friendly.<br>
[0003]       Melt spinning TPU fibers involves feeding TPU polymer into an extruder and<br>
from the extruder to a spinneret where the fiber exits the spinneret. Polymers, such as<br>
TPU, tend to crystallize or crosslink so as to form lumps if they remain in melt<br>
processing equipment for too long. This is especially the case where crosslinking agents<br>
are added to the TPU prior to being fed to the spinneret. These early formed crystallized<br>
polymer and/or crosslinked polymer lumps may find their way through the spinneret and<br>
cause defects or undesirable properties in the fiber. Fiber breakage can also result.<br>
Lumps of crystallized and/or crosslinked material may also accumulate in the cavities<br>
upstream of the fiber opening. This can result in excessive back pressure and reduced<br>
material flow. Back pressure can build up to the point where fiber can no longer be<br>
produced. This requires shutting down the process of manufacturing the fiber and<br>
cleaning the equipment to remove the blocking material.<br>
[0004]       Another problem that can occur with melt spinning TPU fibers is that the<br>
modulus of the fibers can be too high for circular knitting applications.<br>
[0005]       Thus, there exists a need for improvements in melt spinning of elastomeric<br>
fibers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]       It is an object of an exemplary embodiment to melt spin elastic fibers, such as<br>
TPU, in a process that gives long run times.<br>
 <br>
 [0007]       It is another object of an exemplary embodiment to make a melt spun TPU<br>
fiber with lower modulus, as measured at 100% elongation.<br>
[0008]       It is another object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a spin pack<br>
assembly that produces a fiber with more desirable properties, provides faster running<br>
rates, and achieves longer run times.<br>
[0009]       Further objects of exemplary embodiments will be made apparent in the<br>
detailed description herein and the appended claims.<br>
[0010]       These objects are accomplished in an exemplary embodiment by using a spin<br>
pack assembly to produce a fiber. The spin pack assembly includes a breaker plate<br>
comprising a circular metal plate with a plurality of apertures of different size diameters.<br>
The aperture in the center of the breaker plate is the smallest hole and the apertures are<br>
progressively larger the farther they are from the center of the breaker plate. The<br>
apertures the greatest distance from the center have the largest diameter. This<br>
configuration of the holes in the breaker plate provides for first-in/first-out flow of<br>
material throughout generally the entire cavity within the spin pack assembly. The flow<br>
in the exemplary embodiment provides for increased flow in areas radially disposed from<br>
a central axis of the spin pack assembly. In the exemplary embodiment this approach<br>
generally avoids material being resident within the spin pack assembly for a time that is<br>
less than a reaction time after which numerous lumps of cross linked and/or crystallized<br>
material form within the assembly. The approach of the exemplary embodiment<br>
provides desirable flow properties that produce fewer defects in the fiber. In addition,<br>
the exemplary structure of the spin pack assembly provides lower back pressure buildup<br>
through longer running times which reduces process downtime and increases<br>
productivity.<br>
[0011]       In the exemplary embodiment of the spin pack assembly, the spin pack<br>
assembly has a generally cylindrical body with a body opening. The fiber is produced by<br>
passing the material through a fiber opening in a spinneret plate. The fiber is produced at<br>
an exit. The exit is disposed axially inward relative to the body opening. This structure<br>
in the exemplary embodiment allows the fibers to cool more slowly relative to prior<br>
designs. This results in lower modulus fiber and enables faster running rates.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023]       Referring now to the drawings and particularly to FIG. 1 there is shown<br>
therein a spin pack assembly (10) of an exemplary embodiment. The spin pack assembly<br>
10 includes a generally cylindrical body 12. Body 12 extends along a central axis 14.<br>
[0024]       In the exemplary embodiment the body includes the body opening 16 at an<br>
axial end thereof. Body opening 16 is of a smaller diameter than a bore 18 which<br>
extends within the body. In the assembled position of the spin pack assembly the bore<br>
includes a number of stacked components. These components in the exemplary<br>
embodiment include an annular spacer 20. In the exemplary embodiment spacer 20 is<br>
supported on an inward extending annular step 22 that bounds the bore.<br>
 <br>
 [0025]       A spinneret plate 24 is positioned adjacent to spacer 20. Spinneret plate 24<br>
includes an axially positioned fiber opening 26 therein. Opening 26 produces a single<br>
fiber from the exemplary spin pack assembly in a manner later discussed. The single<br>
fiber is produced at an exit 28 from the fiber opening. The exit is disposed axially<br>
inward of the body opening in the exemplary embodiment. The exemplary spinneret<br>
plate 24 further includes a recess area therein which is bounded by a generally planar<br>
annular surface 30. Planar annular surface 30 generally extends in surrounding relation<br>
of the fiber opening 26.<br>
[0026]       An annular washer 32 is positioned in the assembly adjacent to the spinneret<br>
plate 24. The annular washer 32 of the exemplary embodiment includes a central<br>
opening that corresponds in diameter to the recess in the spinneret plate.<br>
[0027]       The exemplary assembly further includes a breaker plate 34. The breaker<br>
plate 34 of the exemplary embodiment includes a plurality of apertures 36 therethrough.<br>
As later discussed in detail the arrangement of apertures of the exemplary embodiment<br>
provides material flow properties through the spin pack assembly that provides desirable<br>
properties in producing the fiber.<br>
[0028]       Adjacent to the breaker plate 34 of the exemplary embodiment is a screen 38.<br>
As best shown in FIG. 8 the screen of the exemplary embodiment includes a central<br>
porous area and a peripheral annular solid area. Of course it should be understood that<br>
this structure is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0029]       The exemplary assembly further includes a transport channel piece 40. The<br>
transport channel piece of the exemplary embodiment includes an annular portion 42 and<br>
a cylindrical projection portion 44. An inlet 46 operative to receive fluid material<br>
extends axially through the transport channel piece. In the exemplary embodiment the<br>
transport channel piece includes a generally planar annular surface 48. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment the generally planar annular surface extends in surrounding relation of the<br>
inlet 46. The exemplary transport channel piece 40 also includes on the cylindrical<br>
projection portion, a recess in which a compression washer 50 is positioned.<br>
Compression washer 50 facilitates fluid tight connection with a conduit that supplies the<br>
fluid material which forms the fiber.<br>
[0030]       The exemplary spin pack assembly further includes a compression nut 52.<br>
Compression nut 52 of the exemplary embodiment includes an external annular threaded<br>
 <br>
portion 54. Threaded portion 54 is configured to engage mating threads positioned in a<br>
corresponding portion of the bore 18. Compression nut 52 further includes an access<br>
opening 56 which is axially centered therein. The cylindrical projecting portion of the<br>
transport channel piece of the exemplary embodiment extends through the access<br>
opening in the assembled condition of the spin pack assembly. It should be further<br>
understood that the compression nut 52 may include apertures or other suitable structures<br>
that facilitate rotation of the compression nut so as to hold the components of the spin<br>
pack assembly in assembled stacked relation in the bore during use and for also enabling<br>
the disassembly of the components as may be desirable for replacement, cleaning or<br>
other purposes. Of course it should be understood* that these structures are exemplary<br>
and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0031]       As is apparent from FIGS. 8 and 9, in the exemplary embodiment of the<br>
assembly, the spacer, spinneret plate, washer, breaker plate, screen and transport channel<br>
piece may be assembled in the bore 18. The assembled components are held in place<br>
therein by tightening the compression nut 52. Further, when the components are<br>
assembled the spin pack assembly includes a cavity area generally indicated 58, through<br>
which the material flows between the inlet 46 and the exit 28. In addition as can be<br>
appreciated, the components of the spin pack assembly may be removed for repair,<br>
replacement or cleaning by loosening the compression nut 52 and removing the various<br>
components from the bore. It should be further understood that these components are<br>
exemplary and the principles described herein may be used with other components in<br>
spin pack assemblies or other assemblies which are adapted for producing fibers of<br>
thermoplastic materials.<br>
[0032]       FIG. 2 shows a top view of the exemplary breaker plate 34. As discussed, the<br>
exemplary breaker plate 34 includes a plurality of apertures 36. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment the apertures include an axially aligned central aperture 60. Central<br>
aperture 60 in the assembled position of the spin pack assembly is aligned with the axis<br>
14. The exemplary breaker plate 34 further includes apertures arranged in three<br>
concentric circular patterns about the central aperture 60. Apertures 62 are included in<br>
the first concentric circular pattern. Apertures 64 are included in the second concentric<br>
circular pattern and are disposed radially outward relative to the apertures 62 in the first<br>
concentric circular pattern. Apertures 66 in the third concentric circular pattern are<br>
 <br>
disposed radially outward of the apertures 64 in the second concentric circular pattern.<br>
Of course it should be understood while in the exemplary embodiment three concentric<br>
circular patterns are used, in other embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0033]       In exemplary embodiments the apertures 62 in the first concentric circular<br>
pattern are of a smaller effective diameter for purposes of material flow and have a<br>
smaller cross-sectional area than the apertures 64 in the second concentric circular<br>
pattern. Likewise, in the exemplary embodiment the apertures 66 in the third concentric<br>
circular pattern have a greater diameter and cross-sectional area than the apertures 64 in<br>
the second concentric circular pattern.<br>
[0034]       Further, in the exemplary embodiment the. radial distance from the central<br>
aperture 60 to the apertures 62 in the first concentric circular pattern, is a greater radial<br>
distance than the radial distance between the apertures 62 and the apertures 64, and is<br>
also a greater radial distance than between the apertures 64 and the apertures 66. This<br>
configuration in the exemplary embodiment provides flow properties which have proven<br>
desirable for purposes of producing fibers of the exemplary embodiment.<br>
[0035]       During operation of the exemplary embodiment the plurality of apertures<br>
provide a greater material flow with increasing radial distance from the axis 14. This<br>
approach provides for a desirable flow pattern within the cavity area 58. The aperture<br>
arrangement provides a first-in/first-out flow generally throughout the entire cavity area.<br>
This flow which can alternatively be referred to as plug flow, assures that generally the<br>
polymer melt in the cavity area is not resident during operation for the reaction time that<br>
would otherwise result in the production of crosslinked and/or crystalline material which<br>
forms semi-solid lumps in the polymer melt. For purposes of this disclosure the term<br>
"lumps" should be understood to include solid and semi-solid bodies which have a<br>
consistency less fluid than the other material flowing through the cavity area. As<br>
previously discussed, such lumps are undesirable, and may cause defects and undesirable<br>
properties in the fiber which is produced. Such lumps within the cavity area can also<br>
produce increased back pressure which impedes the flow of material through the spin<br>
pack assembly to produce the fiber. Such reduced flow results in slower running speeds<br>
and eventually stoppage of the production process so that the spin pack assembly can be<br>
cleaned.<br>
 <br>
 [0036]       The principles employed in connection with the exemplary breaker plate 34<br>
can be further appreciated from the pattern of apertures shown in the prior art breaker<br>
plate 68 shown in FIG. 3. The prior art breaker plate 68 includes a uniform pattern of<br>
apertures. This uniform pattern generally results in most material passing through the<br>
central apertures and through the opening the spinneret plate to produce the fiber.<br>
Material passing through other apertures moves more slowly and thus more material<br>
remains within the spin pack assembly for a period of time that reaches the reaction time.<br>
As a result, lumps form within the cavity area. These lumps operate to restrict flow<br>
which results in increased back pressure and slower operating speeds. The formation of<br>
such lumps also impacts the quality of the fiber material produced at the spinneret<br>
opening. These undesirable aspects are reduced by applying the principles described<br>
herein.<br>
[0037]       Although in an exemplary embodiment the arrangement of concentric circular<br>
patterns of apertures is used to achieve desirable flow properties, in other embodiments<br>
other approaches may be used. These may include for example, breaker plates which<br>
include arcuate patterns of apertures to achieve desirable characteristics. These arcuate<br>
patterns may include elongated slots or spirals that achieve flow characteristics that<br>
produce the desirable results as described. In other embodiments spiral arrangements of<br>
apertures including apertures of various shapes may be used. In still other embodiments<br>
structures other than breaker plates may be employed so as to achieve the desired flow<br>
properties. These flow properties can be achieved through the use of apertures, vanes,<br>
weirs or other structures. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other<br>
embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0038]       A further useful aspect of the exemplary spin pack assembly is the shape<br>
associated with the cavity area 58. In the exemplary embodiment the cavity area is<br>
axially bounded by the generally annular surfaces 48 and 30. These generally annular<br>
surfaces provide advantages in the nature of maximizing flow rates and minimizing<br>
surface area.<br>
[0039]       FIG. 4 shows the transport channel piece 40 of the exemplary embodiment.<br>
The planar surface 48 surrounds the material inlet and during operation forces material to<br>
flow radially outwardly as the material enters the recessed area therein at elevated<br>
pressure. This structure helps to move the material through the transport channel piece<br>
 <br>
generally more quickly compared to the prior art structure 70 which is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
As can be appreciated the prior transport channel piece 70 includes a more conical<br>
chamber. The conical chamber increases the area and potential material residence time<br>
within the cavity. The structure of the exemplary piece 40 is intended to minimize those<br>
conditions which may result in undesirable lumps within the material. Similar principles<br>
apply to the configuration of the planar annular surface 30 which surrounds the fiber<br>
opening in the spinneret plate 34. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other<br>
embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0040]       A further useful aspect of the exemplary embodiment of the spin pack<br>
assembly is the configuration of the fiber exit from the spinneret plate relative to the .<br>
body opening. In the exemplary embodiment the exit 28 of the axially positioned fiber<br>
opening 26 is axially disposed inwardly relative to the flat annular surface 72 in which<br>
. the body opening 16 extends. In the exemplary embodiment the fiber exit 28 is disposed<br>
axially inwardly more than 5 millimeters (mm) in the body annular surface. Further in<br>
the exemplary embodiment used in the production of TPU fiber, the exit is recessed 15.5<br>
mm relative to the body annular surface. In alternative embodiments greater recesses<br>
may be used. This recessed configuration allows the fiber to cool more slowly. This<br>
results because during the critical period after the fiber first exits the opening in the<br>
spinneret plate, the fiber remains surrounded by the hot body of the spin pack assembly.<br>
Further, as the fiber passes out the exit it is surrounded within the recess by relatively<br>
stagnant hot air that further facilitates slower cooling. This slowness to cool in the<br>
exemplary embodiment results in a fiber having a lower modulus at 100% elongation.<br>
This lower modulus is especially desirable when the fiber is to be used in circular<br>
knitting processes such as to make fabric.<br>
[0041]       FIG. 10 shows the axial end of the spin pack assembly of an exemplary<br>
embodiment with the exit 28 of the spinneret plate axially recessed inwardly relative to<br>
the opening in the body. FIG. 11 contrasts the prior art approach in which the exit from<br>
the spinneret plate was generally at the same level or only recessed slightly such as in the<br>
range of 2 mm from the body annular surface. Similarly FIG. 6 shows an isometric view<br>
of the spacer 20 which serves to recess the opening in the spinneret plate and the exit<br>
therein, from the body opening. This is in contrast to the prior art spinneret plate 74<br>
shown in FIG. 7.<br>
 <br>
 [0042]       As can be appreciated from a comparison to the exemplary embodiment to<br>
the prior art, the exemplary embodiment slows the cooling of the fiber through the use of<br>
recessed fiber exit and the surround body recess. This approach substantially improves<br>
the properties of the fiber which is produced using the spin pack assembly of the<br>
exemplary embodiment. Of course these structures are exemplary and in other<br>
embodiments other approaches may be used.<br>
[0043]       In an exemplary embodiment the polymer material to be melt spun into<br>
elastic fibers is fed to an extruder to melt the polymer. The melted polymer can<br>
optionally be fed from the extruder and'mixed with a crosslinking agent and fed to a<br>
manifold. If no crosslinking agent is used, the polymer melt is fed directly to a manifold.<br>
The polymer flows from the manifold to a melt pump. The melt pump feds the polymer<br>
to the spin pack assembly. The polymer melt enters the spin pack assembly through the<br>
inlet 46. The polymer melt proceeds from the entrance 46 through the screen 38. The<br>
screen 38 removes any foreign matter and unmelted polymer. The polymer melt material<br>
proceeds through the screen 38 to the breaker plate 34. The polymer passes through the<br>
apertures in the breaker plate to the spinneret plate 24. From the spinneret plate 24 a<br>
fiber is formed at the exit 28 as the polymer melt is passed through the fiber opening 26<br>
in the spinneret plate 24. The fiber is cooled and coated with finishing oil and wound<br>
into bobbins.	<br>
[0044]       The most desirable elastic fiber to use in this exemplary embodiment is a<br>
lightly crosslinked thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The preferred TPU polymer will<br>
be described below.<br>
[0045] The preferred TPU embodiment is a polyether TPU. The TPU is made from a<br>
blend of hydroxyl terminated intermediates reacted with a polyisocyanate and a hydroxyl<br>
terminated chain extender.<br>
[0046]       It has been found that when using a polyether TPU polymer to make melt<br>
spun fiber, a blend of hydroxyl terminated intermediates having different number<br>
average molecular weights gives superior processing features for melt spinning fibers. It<br>
has been found that if the blend of hydroxyl terminated intermediates is such that the<br>
higher molecular weight intermediate blended with the lower molecular weight<br>
intermediate gives a weighted average molecular weight of at least 1200 Daltons.<br>
Preferably, from 1200 to 4000 Daltons, and more preferably from 1500 to 2500 Daltons,<br>
 <br>
the TPU can be melt spun for extended periods of time without excessive pressure<br>
building up in the exemplary spin pack assembly. This avoids excessive pressure which<br>
results in fiber breakage, thus requiring the melt spinning operation to be halted until the<br>
spin pack can be cleaned.<br>
[0047]       To produce the melt-spun fibers according to an exemplary embodiment, it is<br>
required to have a TPU made from a blend of at least two hydroxyl terminated<br>
intermediates and a crosslinking agent. The blend of intermediates has a first polyether<br>
intermediate as the major component and with a higher Mn than the second intermediate.<br>
The second intermediate is selected from the group consisting of polyether, polyester,'<br>
polycarbonate, polycaprolactone, and mixtures thereof; and the second intermediate has a<br>
lower Mn than the first intermediate. Preferably, the second intermediate is also a<br>
polyether. For simplicity, the embodiment will be described herein in terms of polyether<br>
TPU having a blend of polyether intermediates. It should be recognized that the second<br>
intermediate can be other than polyether intermediates, but must be present in lower<br>
amounts and have a lower Mn than the first polyether intermediate.<br>
[0048]       The polyether TPU used can be made by reacting a blend of at least two<br>
polyether hydroxyl terminated intermediates with a polyisocyanate and a chain extender.<br>
[0049]       Hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediates are polyether polyols derived<br>
from a diol or polyol having a total of from 2 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl diol<br>
or glycol which is reacted with an ether comprising an alkylene oxide having from 2 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, typically ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or mixtures thereof. For<br>
example, hydroxyl functional polyether can be produced by first reacting propylene<br>
glycol with propylene oxide followed by subsequent reaction with ethylene oxide.<br>
Primary hydroxyl groups resulting from ethylene oxide are more reactive than secondary<br>
hydroxyl groups and thus are preferred. Useful commercial polyether polyols include<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) comprising ethylene oxide reacted with ethylene glycol,<br>
poly(propylene glycol) comprising propylene oxide reacted with propylene glycol,<br>
poly(tetramethyl glycol) comprising water reacted with tetrahydrofuran (PTMEG).<br>
Polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG) is the preferred polyether intermediate.<br>
Polyether polyols further include polyamide adducts of an alkylene oxide and can<br>
include, for example, ethylenediamine adduct comprising the reaction product of<br>
ethylenediamine and propylene oxide, diethylenetriamine adduct comprising the reaction<br>
 <br>
product of diethylenetriamine with propylene oxide, and similar polyamide type<br>
polyether polyols. Copolyethers can also be utilized in exemplary embodiments.<br>
Typical copolyethers include the reaction product of THF and ethylene oxide or THF and<br>
propylene oxide. These are available from BASF as Poly THF B, a block copolymer,<br>
and poly THF R, a random copolymer. The various polyether intermediates generally<br>
have a number average molecular weight (Mn), as determined by assay of the terminal<br>
functional groups which is an average molecular weight greater than 700, such as from<br>
about 700 to about 10,000, desirably from about 1000 to about 5,000, and preferably<br>
from about 1000 to about 2500 Daltons.<br>
[0050]       Exemplary embodiments use a blend of two or more polyether intermediates,<br>
with one polyether being a higher molecular weight than the other polyether. The lower<br>
molecular weight polyether will have a molecular weight Mn of from 700 to 1500<br>
Daltons while the higher molecular weight polyether will have a Mn from about 1500 to<br>
about 4000 Daltons, preferably from about 1800 to about 2500 Daltons. The blend<br>
should have a weighted average molecular weight of greater than 1200 Daltons,<br>
preferably greater than 1500 Daltons. For example, a 1000 gram sample of a blend of<br>
70% by weight of a 2000 Mn polyether and 30% by weight of a 1000 Mn polyether<br>
would have a weighted average Mn of 1538 Daltons of the two components in the 1000<br>
grams mixture. The 2000 Mn polyether component would have 0.35 moles (1000 x<br>
0.7/2000). The 1000 Mn polyether component would have 0.3 moles (1000 x 0.3/1000).<br>
The total moles would be 0.65 (0.35 + 0.3) moles in the 1000 gram sample and have a<br>
weighted average Mn of (1000/0.65) or 1538 M„.<br>
[0051]       The weight ratio in the blend of the first polyether hydroxyl terminated<br>
intermediate to the second hydroxyl terminated intermediate is from about 60:40 to about<br>
90:10, and preferably from about 70:30 to 90:10. The amount of the first polyether<br>
intermediate is greater than the amount of the second intermediate.<br>
[0052]       The second necessary ingredient to make the TPU polymer of this<br>
embodiment is a polyisocyanate.<br>
[0053]       The polyisocyanates generally have the formula R(NCO)n where n is<br>
generally from 2 to 4 with 2 being highly preferred inasmuch as the composition is a<br>
thermoplastic. Thus, polyisocyanates having a functionality of 3 or 4 are utilized in very<br>
small amounts, for example less than 5% and desirably less than 2% by weight based<br>
 <br>
upon the total weight of all polyisocyanates, inasmuch as they cause crosslinking. R can<br>
be aromatic, cycloaliphatic, and aliphatic, or combinations thereof generally having a<br>
total of from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable aromatic diisocyanates<br>
include diphenyl methane-4, 4'-diisocyanate (MDI), Hi2 MDI, m-xylylene diisocyanate<br>
(XDI), m-tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), phenylene-1, 4-diisocyanate<br>
(PPDI), 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), and diphenylmethane-3, 3'-dimethoxy-4, 4'-<br>
diisocyanate (TODI). Examples of suitable aliphatic diisocyanates include isophorone<br>
diisocyanate (IPDI), 1,4-cyclohexyl diisocyanate (CHDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
(HDI), l,6-diisocyanato-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl hexane (TMDI), 1,10-decane diisocyanate,<br>
and trans-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (HMDI). A highly preferred diisocyanate is<br>
MDI containing less than about 3% by weight of ortho-para (2,4) isomer. A blend of<br>
two or more polyisocyanates may be used.<br>
[0054]       The third necessary ingredient to make the TPU polymer is the chain<br>
extender. Suitable chain extenders are lower aliphatic or short chain glycols having from<br>
about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms and include for instance ethylene glycol, diethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, triethylene glycol, Cis-<br>
trans-isomers of cyclohexyl dimethylol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexandiol,<br>
1,3-butanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol. Aromatic glycols can also be used as the chain<br>
extender and are the preferred choice for high heat applications. Benzene glycol (HQEE)<br>
and xylenene glycols are suitable chain extenders for use in making the TPU of this<br>
invention. Xylenene glycol is a mixture of 1,4-di(hydroxymethyl) benzene and 1,2-<br>
di(hydroxymethyl) benzene. Benzene glycol is the preferred aromatic chain extender<br>
and specifically includes hydroquinone, i.e., bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether also known as<br>
l,4-di(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzene; resorcinol, i.e., bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether also<br>
known as l,3-di(2-hydroxyethyl) benzene; catechol, i.e., bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether<br>
also known as 1,2-di(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzene; and combinations thereof. For high<br>
heat resistant fibers, benzene glycol (HQEE) is the desired chain extender. Excellent<br>
results are obtained by using HQEE together with an isomer of HQEE.<br>
[0055]       It is preferred to use a co-chain extender together with the chain extender<br>
described above. The co-chain extender can be one of the materials described above as a<br>
chain extender. The co-chain extender is preferably selected from a material capable of<br>
reducing the crystallization rate of the TPU and eliminating high temperature melting<br>
 <br>
peaks of the TPU. Branched compounds, such as dipropylene glycol and neopentyl<br>
glycol are excellent co-chain extenders. Also, for high heat applications, an isomer of<br>
HQEE, such as hydroxyl ethyl resorcinol (HER), is a very effective co-chain extender.<br>
When a co-chain extender is used, the level used is from about 2 to about 50 mole<br>
percent, preferably 10 to 30 mole percent, of the total moles of the chain extender and the<br>
co-chain extender.<br>
[0056]       A blend of two or more chain extenders can be used with a blend of two or<br>
more co-chain extenders, if desired. However, for simplicity, usually one chain extender<br>
is used with one co-chain extender.<br>
[0057]       The above three necessary ingredients (blend of different Mn polyether<br>
intermediates, polyisocyanate, and chain extender) are preferably reacted in the presence<br>
of a catalyst.<br>
[0058]       Generally, any conventional catalyst can be utilized to react the diisocyanate<br>
with the polyether intermediates or the chain extender and the same is well known in the<br>
art and in the literature. Examples of suitable catalysts include the various alkyl ethers or<br>
alkyl thiol ethers of bismuth or tin wherein the alkyl portion has from 1 to about 20<br>
carbon atoms with specific examples including bismuth octoate, bismuth laurate, and the<br>
like. Preferred catalysts include the various tin catalysts such as stannous octoate,<br>
dibutyltin dioctoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, and the like. The amount of such catalyst is<br>
generally small such as from about 20 to about 200 parts per million based upon the total<br>
weight of the polyurethane forming monomers.<br>
[0059]       The polyether TPU polymers of this invention can be made by any of the<br>
conventional polymerization methods well known in the art and literature.<br>
[0060]       Thermoplastic polyurethanes of exemplary embodiments are preferably made<br>
via a "one shot" process wherein all the components are added together simultaneously<br>
or substantially simultaneously to a heated extruder and reacted to form the<br>
polyurethane. The equivalent ratio of the diisocyanate to the total equivalents of the<br>
hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediates and the diol chain extender is generally<br>
from about 0.95 to about 1.10, desirably from about 0.97 to about 1.03, and preferably<br>
from about 0.97 to about 1.00. It is preferred that the equivalent ratio is less than 1.0<br>
such that the TPU has terminal hydroxyl groups to enhance the reaction with the<br>
crosslinking agent during the fiber spinning process. The Shore A hardness of the TPU<br>
 <br>
formed should be from 65A to 95A, and preferably from about 75A to about 85A, to<br>
achieve the most desirable melt spun fibers. Reaction temperatures utilizing urethane<br>
catalyst are generally from about 175°C to about 245°C and preferably from about 180°C<br>
to about 220°C. The molecular weight (Mw) of the thermoplastic polyurethane is<br>
generally from about 25,000 to about 300,000 and desirably from about 50,000 to about<br>
200,000 and preferably about 75,000 to about 150,000 as measured by GPC relative to<br>
polystyrene standards. The preferred Mw is lower than the prior art recommends for the<br>
TPU fiber, but the lower Mw allows for better mixing of the TPU with the crosslinking<br>
agent to give excellent fiber spinning.<br>
• [0061]       The thermoplastic polyurethanes can also be prepared utilizing a pre-polymer<br>
process. In the pre-polymer route, the hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediates are<br>
reacted with generally an equivalent excess of one or more polyisocyanates to form a<br>
pre-polymer solution having free or unreacted polyisocyanate therein. Reaction is<br>
generally carried out at temperatures of from about 80°C to about 220°C and preferably<br>
from about 150°C to about 200°C in the presence of a suitable urethane catalyst.<br>
Subsequently, a selective type of chain extender as noted above is added in an equivalent<br>
amount generally equal to the isocyanate end groups as well as to any free or unreacted<br>
diisocyanate compounds. The overall equivalent ratio of the total diisocyanate to the<br>
total equivalent of the hydroxyl terminated polyethers and the chain extender is thus<br>
from about 0.95 to about 1.10, desirably from about 0.98 to about 1.05 and preferably<br>
from about 0.99 to about 1.03. The equivalent ratio of the hydroxyl terminated<br>
polyethers to the chain extender is adjusted to give 65A to 95A, preferably 75A to 85A<br>
Shore hardness. The chain extension reaction temperature is generally from about 180°C<br>
to about 250°C with from about 200°C to about 240°C being preferred. Typically, the<br>
pre-polymer route can be carried out in any conventional device with an extruder being<br>
preferred. Thus, the polyether intermediates are reacted with an equivalent excess of a<br>
diisocyanate in a first portion of the extruder to form a pre-polymer solution and<br>
subsequently the chain extender is added at a downstream portion and reacted with the<br>
pre-polymer solution. Any conventional extruder can be utilized, with extruders<br>
equipped with barrier screws having a length to diameter ratio of at least 20 and<br>
preferably at least 25. The prepolymer method can reduce high temperature melting<br>
 <br>
peaks of the TPU and eliminate the need for a co-chain extender as described in the one-<br>
shot process above.<br>
[0062]       Useful additives can be utilized in suitable amounts and include opacifying<br>
pigments, colorants, mineral fillers, stabilizers, lubricants, UV absorbers, processing<br>
aids, and other additives as desired. Useful opacifying pigments include titanium<br>
dioxide, zinc oxide, and titanate yellow, while useful tinting pigments include carbon<br>
black, yellow oxides, brown oxides, raw and burnt sienna or umber, chromium oxide<br>
green, cadmium pigments, chromium pigments, and other mixed metal oxide and organic<br>
pigments. Useful fillers include diatomaceous earth (superfloss) clay, silica, talc, mica,<br>
wallostonite, barium sulfate,, and calcium carbonate. If desired, useful stabilizers such as<br>
antioxidants can be used and include phenolic antioxidants, while useful photostabilizers<br>
include organic phosphates, and organotin thiolates (mercaptides). Useful lubricants<br>
include metal stearates, paraffin oils and amide waxes. Useful UV absorbers include 2-<br>
(2'-hydroxyphenol) benzotriazoles and 2-hydroxybenzophenones.<br>
[0063]       Plasticizer additives can also be utilized advantageously to reduce hardness<br>
without affecting properties.<br>
[0064]       During the melt spinning process, the TPU polymer described above is lightly<br>
crosslinked with a crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent is a pre-polymer of a<br>
hydroxyl terminated intermediate that is a polyether, polyester, polycarbonate,<br>
polycaprolactone, or mixture thereof reacted with a polyisocyanate. A polyester or<br>
polyether is the preferred hydroxyl terminated intermediate to make the crosslinking<br>
agent. The crosslinking agent, pre-polymer, will have an isocyanate functionality of<br>
greater than about 1.0, preferably from about 1.0 to about 3.0, and more preferably from<br>
about 1.8 to about 2.2. It is particularly preferred if both ends of hydroxyl terminated<br>
intermediate is capped with an isocyanate, thus having an isocyanate functionality of 2.0.<br>
[0065]       The polyisocyanate used to make the crosslinking agent are the same as<br>
described above in making the TPU polymer. A diisocyanate, such as MDI, is the<br>
preferred diisocyanate.<br>
[0066]       The hydroxyl terminated polyester intermediate used to make the crosslinking<br>
agent is generally a linear or branched polyester having a number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) of from about 500 to about 10,000, desirably from about 700 to about<br>
5,000, and preferably from about 700 to about 4,000, an acid number generally less than<br>
 <br>
1.3 and preferably less than 0.8. The molecular weight is determined by assay of the<br>
terminal functional groups and is related to the number average molecular weight. The<br>
polymers are produced by (1) an esterification reaction of one or more glycols with one<br>
or more dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides or (2) by transesterification reaction, i.e., the<br>
reaction of one or more glycols with esters of dicarboxylic acids. Mole ratios generally<br>
in excess of more than one mole of glycol to acid are preferred so as to obtain linear<br>
chains having a preponderance of terminal hydroxyl groups. Suitable polyester<br>
intermediates also include various lactones such as polycaprolactone typically made<br>
from e-caprolactone and a bifunctional initiator such as diethylene glycol. The<br>
dicarboxylic acids of the desired polyester can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, or<br>
combinations thereof. Suitable dicarboxylic acids which may be used alone or in<br>
mixtures generally have a total of from 4 to 15 carbon atoms and include: succinic,<br>
glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic, isophthalic,<br>
terephthalic, cyclohexane dicarboxylic, and the like. Anhydrides of the above<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, or the like,<br>
can also be used. Adipic acid is the preferred acid. The glycols which are reacted to<br>
form a desirable polyester intermediate can be aliphatic, aromatic, or combinations<br>
thereof, and have a total of from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and include ethylene glycol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol, decamethylene glycol, dodecamethylene glycol, and the like.<br>
1,4-butanediol and mixtures with neopentyl glycol are the preferred glycol.<br>
[0067]       U.S. Patent No. 4,131,731 is hereby incorporated by reference for its<br>
disclosure of hydroxyl terminated polycarbonates and their preparation. Such<br>
polycarbonates are linear and have terminal hydroxyl groups with essential exclusion of<br>
other terminal groups. The essential reactants are glycols and carbonates. Suitable<br>
glycols are selected from cycloaliphatic and aliphatic diols containing 4 to 40, and<br>
preferably 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and from polyoxyalkylene glycols containing 2 to 20<br>
alkoxy groups per molecular with each alkoxy group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Diols suitable for use in exemplary embodiments include aliphatic diols containing 4 to<br>
12 carbon atoms such as butanediol-1,4, pentanediol-1,4, neopentyl glycol, hexanediol-<br>
1,6, 2,2,4-trimethylhexanediol-l,6, decanediol-1,10, hydrogenated dilinoleylglycol,<br>
 <br>
hydrogenated dioleylglycol; and cycloaHphatic diols such as cyclohexanediol-1,3,<br>
dimethylolcyclohexane-1,4, cyclohexanediol-1,4, dimethylolcyclohexane-1,3, 1,4-<br>
endomethylene-2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, and polyalkylene glycols.<br>
The diols used in the reaction may be a single diol or a mixture of diols depending on the<br>
properties desired in the finished product.<br>
[0068]       Polycarbonate intermediates which are hydroxyl terminated are generally<br>
those known in the art and in the literature. Suitable carbonates are selected from<br>
alkylene carbonates composed of a 5 to 7 membered ring having the following general<br>
formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R is a saturated divalent radical containing 2 to 6 linear carbon atoms. Suitable<br>
carbonates for use herein include ethylene carbonate, trimethylene carbonate,<br>
tetramethylene carbonate, 1,2-propylene carbonate, 1,2-butylene carbonate, 2,3-butylene<br>
carbonate, 1,2-ethylene carbonate, 1,3-pentylene carbonate, 1,4-pentylene carbonate, 2,3-<br>
pentylene carbonate, and 2,4-pentylene carbonate.<br>
[0069]       Also, suitable herein are dialkylcarbonates, cycloaHphatic carbonates, and<br>
diarylcarbonates. The dialkylcarbonates can contain 2 to 5 carbon atoms in each alkyl<br>
group and specific examples thereof are diethylcarbonate and dipropylcarbonate.<br>
CycloaHphatic carbonates, especially dicycloaliphatic carbonates, can contain 4 to 7<br>
carbon atoms in each cyclic structure, and there can be one or two of such structures.<br>
When one group is cycloaHphatic, the other can be either alkyl or aryl. On the other<br>
hand, if one group is aryl, the other can be alkyl or cycloaHphatic. Preferred examples of<br>
diarylcarbonates, which can contain 6 to 20 carbon atoms in each aryl group, are<br>
diphenylcarbonate, ditolylcarbonate, and dinaphthylcarbonate.<br>
[0070]       The reaction is carried out by reacting a glycol with a carbonate, preferably an<br>
alkylene carbonate in the molar range of 10:1 to 1:10, but preferably 3:1 to 1:3 at a<br>
temperature of 100°C to 300°C and at a pressure in the range of 0.1 to 300 mm of<br>
mercury in the presence or absence of an ester interchange catalyst, while removing low<br>
boiling glycols by distillation.<br>
[0071]       More specifically, the hydroxyl terminated polycarbonates are prepared in<br>
two stages. In the first stage, a glycol is reacted with an alkylene carbonate to form a<br>
low molecular weight hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate. The lower boiling point<br>
glycol is removed by distillation at 100°C to 300°C, preferably at 150°C to 250°C, under<br>
a reduced pressure of 10 to 30 mm Hg, preferably 50 to 200 mm Hg. A fractionating<br>
column is used to separate the by-product glycol from the reaction mixture. The by-<br>
product glycol is taken off the top of the column and the unreacted alkylene carbonate<br>
and glycol reactant are returned to the reaction vessel as reflux. A current of inert gas or<br>
an inert solvent can be used to facilitate removal of by-product glycol as it is formed.<br>
When amount of by-product glycol obtained indicates that degree of polymerization of<br>
the hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate is in the range of 2 to 10, the pressure is gradually<br>
reduced to 0.1 to 10 mm Hg and the unreacted glycol and alkylene carbonate are<br>
removed. This marks the beginning of the second stage of reaction during which the low<br>
molecular weight hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate is condensed by distilling off<br>
glycol as it is formed at 100°C to 300°C, preferably 150°C to 250°C and at a pressure of<br>
0.1 to 10 mm Hg until the desired molecular weight of the hydroxyl terminated<br>
polycarbonate is attained. Molecular weight (Mn) of the hydroxyl terminated<br>
polycarbonates can vary from about 500 to about 10,000 but in a preferred embodiment,<br>
it will be in the range of 500 to 2500.<br>
[0072]       If a polyether crosslinking agent is desired, it is made from a hydroxyl<br>
terminated polyether intermediate as described above for making the TPU polymer and<br>
is reacted with a polyisocyanate to form a pre-polymer.<br>
[0073]       The crosslinking agents have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of<br>
from about 1,000 to about 10,000, preferably from about 1,200 to about 4,000 and more<br>
preferably from about 1,500 to about 2,800. Crosslinking agents with a Mn above about<br>
1500 give better set properties.<br>
[0074]       The weight percent of crosslinking agent used with the TPU polymer is from<br>
about 5.0% to about 20%, preferably about 8.0% to about 15%,and more preferably from<br>
about 10% to about 13% The percentage of crosslinking agent used is weight percent<br>
based upon the total weight of TPU polymer and crosslinking agent.<br>
[0075]       The exemplary melt spinning process to make TPU fibers involves feeding a<br>
preformed TPU polymer, usually which is melted in the extruder and the crosslinking<br>
agent is added continuously downstream near the point where the TPU melt exits the<br>
extruder or after the TPU melt exits the extruder. The crosslinking agent can be added to<br>
the extruder before the melt exits the extruder or after the melt exits the extruder. If<br>
added after the melt exits the extruder, the crosslinking agent needs to be mixed with the<br>
TPU melt using static or dynamic mixers to assure proper mixing of the crosslinking<br>
agent into the TPU polymer melt. After, exiting the extruder and mixer, the melted TPU<br>
polymer with crosslinking agent flows into a manifold. The manifold divides the melt<br>
stream into different streams, where each stream is fed to a plurality of spin pack<br>
assemblies. Usually, there is a melt pump for each different stream flowing from the<br>
manifold, with each melt pump feeding several spin pack assemblies. Each spin pack<br>
assembly may be of the type previously described or may have alternative structure.<br>
[0076]       The TPU melt material is forced by elevated pressure through the spin pack<br>
assembly and exits the spinneret plate in the form of a fiber. The size of the hole in the<br>
spinneret plate is based on the desired size (denier) of the fiber. The fiber is drawn or<br>
stretched as it leaves the spin pack assembly and is cooled before winding onto bobbins.<br>
The fibers are stretched by winding the bobbins at a higher speed than that of fiber<br>
exiting the spin pack assembly. For the melt spun TPU fibers, the bobbins are usually<br>
wound at a rate of 4 to 6 times the speed of the fiber exiting the spin pack assembly, but<br>
can be wound slower or faster depending on the particular equipment. Typical bobbin<br>
winding speeds can vary from 100 to 3000 meters per minute, but more typical speeds<br>
are 300 to 1200 meters per minute for TPU melt spun fibers. Finish oils, such as silicone<br>
oils, are usually added to the surface of the fibers after cooling and just prior to being<br>
wound into bobbins.<br>
[0077]       An important aspect of the exemplary melt spinning process is the mixing of<br>
the TPU polymer melt with the crosslinking agent. Proper uniform mixing is important<br>
to achieve uniform fiber properties and to achieve long run times without experiencing<br>
fiber breakage. The mixing of the TPU melt and crosslinking agent should be a method<br>
which achieves plug-flow, i.e., first in first out. The proper mixing can be achieved with<br>
a dynamic mixer or a static mixer. Static mixers are more difficult to clean; therefore, a<br>
dynamic mixer is preferred. A dynamic mixer which has a feed screw and mixing pins is<br>
the preferred mixer. U.S. Patent 6,709,147, which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
describes such a mixer and has mixing pins which can rotate. The mixing pins can also<br>
be in a fixed position, such as attached to the barrel of the mixer and extending toward<br>
the centerline of the feed screw. The mixing feed screw can be attached by threads to the<br>
end of the extruder screw and the housing of the mixer can be bolted to the extruder<br>
machine. The feed screw of the dynamic mixer should be a design which moves the<br>
polymer melt in a progressive manner with very little back mixing to achieve plug-flow<br>
of the melt. The L/D of the mixing screw should be from over 3 to less than 30,<br>
preferably from about 7 to about 20, and more preferably from about 10 to about 12.<br>
[0078]       The temperature in the mixing zone where the TPU polymer melt is mixed<br>
with the crosslinking agent is from about 200°C to about 240°C, preferably from about<br>
210°C to about 225°C. These temperatures are necessary to get the reaction while not<br>
degrading the polymer.<br>
[0079]       The TPU formed is reacted with the crosslinking agent during the fiber<br>
spinning process to give a molecular weight (Mw) of the TPU in fiber form of from<br>
about 200,000 to about 800,000, preferably from about 2.50,000 to about 500,000, more<br>
preferably from about 300,000 to about 450,000. The reaction in the fiber spinning<br>
process between the TPU and the crosslinking agent at the point where the TPU exits the<br>
spin pack assembly should be above 20%, preferably from about 30% to about 60%, and<br>
more preferably from about 40% to about 50%. Typical prior art TPU melt spinning<br>
reaction between the TPU polymer and the crosslinking agent is less than 20%&gt; and<br>
usually about 10-15% reaction. The reaction is determined by the disappearance of the<br>
NCO groups. The higher % reaction of the exemplary embodiment improves melt<br>
strength thus allowing a higher spinning temperature which improves the spinnability of<br>
the TPU. The fibers are normally aged in an oven on the bobbins to fully complete the<br>
reaction and thus all of the NCO groups disappear in the fiber as used in garments.<br>
[0080]       The spinning temperature (the temperature of the polymer melt in the spin<br>
pack assembly) should be higher than the melting point of the polymer, and preferably<br>
from about 10°C to about 20°C above the melting point of the polymer. The higher the<br>
spinning temperature one can use, generally the better the spinning. However, if the<br>
spinning temperature is too high, the polymer can degrade. Therefore, from about 10°C<br>
to about 20°C above the melting point of the TPU polymer, is the optimum for the<br>
exemplary embodiment for achieving a balance of good spinning without degradation of<br>
the polymer. If the spinning temperature is too low, polymer can solidify in the spinneret<br>
and cause fiber breakage. The spinning temperature for the fibers produced in exemplary<br>
embodiments is greater than 200°C and preferably from about 205°C to about 220°C.<br>
[0081]       An important aspect of making melt spun TPU fibers is the time one can run<br>
the process continuously without stopping. The necessity to stop the process is usually a<br>
result of fiber breaking. Fiber breaking occurs when the pressure at the inlet of the spin<br>
pack assembly increases to an unacceptable level. When the pressure reaches about 140<br>
to 200 Kg force per square cm., fiber breakage will usually occur. Pressure buildup can<br>
occur for several reasons such as improper mixing leading to formation of products due<br>
to self reaction of the crosslinking agent causing partial blockage of the small exit hole in<br>
the spinneret for the fiber. The exemplary embodiment allows for much longer run times<br>
before exceeding harmful pressure build-up resulting in fiber breakage.<br>
[0082]       The following examples show advantages of the exemplary spin pack<br>
assembly relative to a conventional spin pack assembly. The spin pack assembly of the<br>
exemplary embodiment was evaluated against the prior art spin pack assembly. The<br>
evaluation was conducted by melt spinning a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer.<br>
The TPU polymer used was made by reacting a polyether hydroxyl terminated<br>
intermediate (a blend of 2000 Mn PTMEG and 1000 Mn PTMEG), a glycol aromatic<br>
chain extender [a blend of benzene glycol (HQEE) and hydroxyl ethyl resorcinol<br>
(HER)], and a diisocyanate (MDI). The three components (polyether intermediate,<br>
glycol chain extender, and diisocyanate) were reacted in a twin screw extruder using the<br>
one-shot process at 200°C. The TPU polymer was palletized and used in Examples 1<br>
and 2 below to spin fibers. The exit at which the fiber was produced by the spin pack<br>
assembly was axially recessed about 15.5 mm from the opening of the body of the spin<br>
pack assembly.<br>
Example 1 (Comparative)<br>
[0083]       The TPU polymer described above was used to melt spin 40 denier fibers.<br>
The TPU polymer pellets were melted in an extruder and the polymer melt was mixed<br>
with a polyester prepolymer crosslinking agent (Hyperlast® 5255) in a dynamic mixer.<br>
The TPU melt containing the crosslinking agent was then fed to the prior art spin pack<br>
assembly and 40 denier melt spun fibers were produced. A silicon finish oil was applied<br>
to the fibers and they were wound onto bobbins at a speed of 600 meters per minute.<br>
After continuous running for 60 hours, the pressure in the spin pack showed an increase<br>
over the beginning pressure of 81.2% and fibers started to break. The run was<br>
terminated because of fiber breakage.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0084]       In this Example, the spin pack assembly of the described exemplary<br>
embodiment was used to make 40 denier fibers. The same TPU polymer and the same<br>
crosslinking agent were used and the same melt spinning process was used as in<br>
Example 1. The only difference was that the spin pack assembly of the exemplary<br>
embodiment was used in place of the prior art spin pack assembly. After continuous<br>
running for 120 hours, the pressure in the spin pack showed an increase of only 9.5%<br>
over the initial pressure. The run was terminated after 120 hours because all material<br>
was consumed.<br>
[0085]       Physical property tests on the fibers made by Comparative Example 1 and<br>
Example 2 showed that the fibers made by Example 2 had a lower 100% modulus<br>
indicating that the recessed exit of the fibers from the spin pack assembly allowed the<br>
fibers to cool slower, thus improving their properties for kitting and weaving.<br>
[0086]       The Examples show that the spin pack assembly of the exemplary<br>
embodiment has major advantages in making elastic fibers, such as TPU. By<br>
dramatically increasing the run time before experiencing fiber breakage because of<br>
excess pressure build-up, the melt spinning process is more economical and there is less<br>
waste from scrap material generated as a result of fiber breakage. The properties of the<br>
TPU fibers are also improved resulting in better knitting and weaving the fibers into<br>
garments.<br>
[0087]       Melt spun TPU fibers can be made in a variety of denier. Denier is a term in<br>
the art designating the fiber size. Denier is the weight in grams of 9000 meters of fiber<br>
length. Typical melt spun TPU fibers are made in a denier size less than 240, more<br>
typical from 10 to less than 240 denier size, with 20 and 40 denier being a popular size.<br>
 [0088]       The elastic TPU fibers are used to combine by knitting or weaving with other<br>
fibers such as natural and synthetic fibers to make various articles of clothing. The TPU<br>
fibers can be dyed various colors.<br>
[0089]       The melt spun elastic TPU fibers of exemplary embodiments are normally<br>
combined by knitting or weaving with other fibers, such as cotton, nylon or polyester to<br>
make various end use articles, including clothing garments. The weight % of the melt<br>
spun elastic fibers in the end use application can vary depending on the desired elasticity.<br>
For example, woven fabrics have from 1-8 wt.%, underwear from 2-5 wt.%, bathing<br>
suits and sportswear from 8-30 wt.%, foundation garments from 10-45 wt.%, and<br>
medical hose from 35-60 wt.% of the elastic melt spun fibers with the remaining amount<br>
being another type of non-elastic fiber.<br>
[0090]       The exemplary configuration of the exemplary spin pack assembly provides<br>
for the fiber produced to cool more slowly which has been found to decrease the 100%<br>
modulus. This decrease in modulus allows the fiber to perform better in knitting<br>
operations, such as circular knitting.<br>
[0091]       The exemplary spin pack assembly produces improved material flow<br>
properties for the polymer, which allows for greater run time before experiencing<br>
problems, such as fiber breakage.<br>
[0092]       While in accordance with the Patent Statutes, the best mode and preferred<br>
embodiment has been set forth, the scope of the invention is not limited thereto, but<br>
rather by the scope of the attached claims.<br>
