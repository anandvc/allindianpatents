METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SELECTIVE<br>
DISTRIBUTED SPEECH RECOGNITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		[0001] The invention relates generally to speech recognition, and more<br>
	specifically. to distributed speech recognition between a wireless device and a<br>
	communication server.<br>
		[0002] With the growth of speech recognition capabilities, there is a<br>
	corresponding increase in the number of applications and uses for speech recognition.<br>
	Different types of speech recognition application and systems have been developed,<br>
	based upon the location of the speech recognition engine with respect to the user<br>
	One such example is an embedded speech recognition engine, otherwise known as a<br>
	local speech recognition engine, such as a Speech2Go speech recognition engine sold<br>
	by Speech Works International, Inc., 695 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02111.<br>
	Another type of speech recognition engine is a network-based Speech recognition<br>
	engine, such as Speech Works 6, as sold by Speech Works International, Inc, 695<br>
	Atlantic Avenue. Boston, MA 02111.<br>
		[0003] Embedded, or local speech recognition engines provide, the added<br>
	benefit of reduced latency in recognizing a speech input, wherein a speech input<br>
	includes any type of audible or audio-based input. One of the drawbacks of<br>
	embedded or local speech recognition engines is that these engines contain a limited<br>
	vocabulary. Due to memory limitations and system processing requirements, in<br>
	conjunction with power consumption limitations, embedded or local speech<br>
	recognition engines are limited to providing recognition to only a fraction of the<br>
	speech inputs which would be recognizable by a network-based speech recognition<br>
	engine.<br>
		[0004] Network-based speech recognition engines provide the added benefit<br>
	of an increased vocabulary, based on the elimination of memory and processing<br>
	restrictions. Although a downside is the added latency between when a user provides<br>
	a speech input and when the speech input may be recognized, and furthermore<br>
1<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	provided back to the end user for confirmation of recognition. Other disadvantages<br>
	include the requirement for continuous availability of the communication path, the<br>
	resulting increased server load, and the cost to the user of connection end service- In<br>
	a typical speech recognition system, the user provides the speech input and the speech<br>
	input is thereupon provided to a.server across a connnunication path, whereupon it<br>
	may then be recognized. Extra latency is incurred in not only transmitting the speech<br>
	input to the network-based speech recognition engine, but also transmitting the<br>
	recognized speech input, or an N-bcst list back to the end user.<br>
		[0005] One proposed solution to overcoming the inherent limitations of<br>
	embedded speech recognition engines and the latency problems associated with<br>
	network-based speech recognition engines is to preliminarily attempt to recognize all<br>
	speech inputs with the embedded speech recognition engine, Thereupon, a<br>
	determination is made if the local speech recognition engine has properly recognized<br>
	the speech input, based upon, among other things, a recognition confidence level. If it<br>
	is deternyned that the speech input has not been recognized by the local speech<br>
	recognirieui engine, such that A confidence Jevel is below a threshold value, ihE speech<br>
	input is thereupon provided to a network-based speech recognition engine. This<br>
	solution, while eliminating laLency issues, with respect to speech inputs that are<br>
	recognized by the embedded speech recognition engine, adds an extra latency step for<br>
	all other inputs by first attempting to recognize the speech input iocally. Therefore,<br>
	when the speech inputs must be recognized using the network-based speech<br>
	recognition engine, the user is required to incur a further delay,<br>
		[0006] Another proposed solution to overcoming the limitations of embedded<br>
	speech recognition engines and network-based speech recognition engines is to<br>
	attempt to recognize the speech input both at the local level, using the embedded<br>
	speech recognition engine, and at the server level, using the network-based speech<br>
	recognition engine. Thereupon, both recognized speech inputs are then compared and<br>
	the user is provided with a best-guess at the recognized inputs. Once again, this<br>
	solution requires the usage of the network-based speech recognition engine, which<br>
2<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	may add extra latency if [he speech input is recognizable by the embedded speech<br>
	recognition engine,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
		[0015] Briefly, a method and apparatus for selective distributed speech<br>
	recognition includes receiving a plurality of grammar type indicators, wherein a<br>
	grammar type indicator is a class of speech recognition patterns associated with a<br>
	plurality of grammar class entries. The grammar class entries are elements within the<br>
	class that is defined by the. grammar class- For example, a grammar type indicator<br>
	may be 'DAYS OF THE WEEK,' containing the grammar type indicator entries of<br>
	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, yesterday and<br>
	tflmotraw. The gjcarrunai type indicator furthfimujne includes an address to the<br>
	grammar class stoned within a speech recognition or may include the grammar class<br>
	itself, consisting of a tagged list of the grammar class entries or may include a<br>
	Universal Resource Identifier(URI) that points to a resource on the network where<br>
	the grammar ctass is available. In another embodiment, the grammar type indicator<br>
	may include a pointer to a specific speech recognition engine having the grammar<br>
	class therein,<br>
		[0016] The method for selective distributed speech recognition further<br>
	includes receiving a speech input that corresponds to one of the grammar class entries.<br>
	As discussed above, a speech input is any type of audio or audible input, typically<br>
	provided by an end user, lhat is to be recognized using a speech recognition engine<br>
	and an action is thereupon to be performed in response to the recogtu'aed speech input.<br>
	The method and apparatus further limits recognition to either an embedded speech<br>
	recognition engine or an external speech recognition engine, based on the grammar<br>
	type indicator. In one embodiment, the embedded speech recognition engine is<br>
	embedded within die apparatus for distributed speech recognition engine, also<br>
	referred to ss a local speech recognition engine, as discussed above, and the external<br>
	speech recognition engine may be a network-based speech recognition engine, also as<br>
	discussed above.<br>
		[0017] Thereupon, the method and apparatus selectively distributes the speech<br>
	input to either the embedded speech recognition engine or the external speech<br>
	recognition engine, such as the nerwork-based speech recognition engine, based on<br>
4<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	the specific grammar type indicator. More specifically, the speech input is encoded<br>
	into an encoded audio input and the encoded audio input, which represents an<br>
	encoding of the speech input, is provided to the selected speech recognition engine.<br>
	Furthermore, the speech input is expected ID correspond to one of the grammar class<br>
	entries for the specific grammar Eype indicator.<br>
		[0018] FIG. I illustrates a wireless device 100 That includes an audio receiver<br>
	102, a dialog manager 104, such as a multi-modal browser Or a voice browser, and a<br>
	first speech recognition engine 106, such as an embedded speech recognition engine.<br>
	The wireless device 100 may be any device capable of receiving communication from<br>
	a wireless or non-wireless device or network, a server or other communication<br>
	network. The wireless device 100 includes, but is not limited to4 B. client device such<br>
	as a cellular phone, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a pager, a smart phone, or<br>
	other wireless devices such as a personal digital assistant, or any other suitable device<br>
	capable of receiving communication as recognized by one having ordinary skill in the<br>
	art. The dialog manager lO4t which may be a muiti-moda! browser capable of<br>
	reacting and outputting mark-up language for multiple modes, such as, but not limited<br>
	to, graphic and voice mode, is operably coupleable to a second speech recognition<br>
	engine IDS. such as an external speech recognition engine which may be a network<br>
	based speech recognition engine.<br>
		[0019] In one embodiment, the dialog manager 104 is operably couplcable to<br>
	the second speech recognition engine 10S through a communication network, not<br>
	shown. Furthermore, the second speech recognition engine 108 may be disposed on a<br>
	communication server, rot shown, wherein a communication server includes any type<br>
	of server in communication with the communication network, such as communication<br>
	through an internet, an intranet, a proprietary server, or any other recognized<br>
	communication path for providing communication between the wireless device 100<br>
	and the communication server, as illustrated below in FIG. 3,<br>
		[0020] The audio receiver 102 receives a speech input 110, such as provided<br>
	from an end user. The audio receiver 102 receives the speech input 110, encodes the<br>
	speech input 110 to generate an encoded audio input 112 and provides the encoded<br>
5<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	audio input 112 to the dialog manager 104. The dialog manager 104 receives a<br>
	plurality of grammar type indicators 114. As discussed below, the grammar type<br>
	indicators may be provided across the communication network (not shown), from one<br>
	or more local processors executing a local application disposed within the<br>
	communication device, or may be provided from any other suitable location any<br>
	recognized by one having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
		[0021] The dialog manager 104 receives the encoded audio input 112 from the<br>
	audio receiver 102 and, based on the grammar type indicators 114, selects either the<br>
	first speech recognition engine 106 or the second speech recognition engine JOB to<br>
	recognize the encoded audio input IJ2. As discussed below, the grammar type<br>
	indicators contain indicators as to which speech recognition engine should be utilized<br>
	to recognize a speech input, based on the complexity of the expected speech input and<br>
	the abilities and/or limitations of the first speech recognition engine 106- When the<br>
	encoded audio input 116 is thereupon provided to the first speech recognition engine<br>
	106 disposed within the wireless device 100, the speech recognition is performed<br>
	within the wireless device 100. When the encoded audio input 118 is provided to the<br>
	second speech recognition engine 10B, Ehe encoded audio input 118 is transmitted<br>
	across a communication interface, not shown, due to the second speech recognition<br>
	engine 108 being external to the wireless device 100. As recognized by one having<br>
	ordinary sfcitl in the art, elements within the cornmuriication device 100 have been<br>
	omitted fnpmHG. 1 for clarity purposes only.<br>
		[0022] FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart representing ihe steps of the method for<br>
	distributed speech recognition. The method begins 130 by receiving a grammar type<br>
	indicator having one or more grammar class entries, such as the grammar type<br>
	indicators 114 of FIG, I. wherein the grammar type indicator is associated with an<br>
	information request, step 132. In the above example, the grammar type indicator may<br>
	represent days of the week and the grammar type indicator entries are the possible<br>
	elements of the class defined by the grammar type indicator, such as Monday,<br>
	Tuesday, et- al. In another embodiment, the grammar type Indicator may be a<br>
	grammar indicator, such as a universal resource identifier {URTJ to a specific grammar<br>
6<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	class, Moreover in another embodiment, the grammar type indicator may be a<br>
	pointer to a specific speech recognition engine having ihe specific gramma* class<br>
	disposed therein. Next, step 134, a speech input corresponding to one of the grammar<br>
	class entries of the grammar type indicator is received, in response to ihe information<br>
	request. This speech input, such as encoded audio input ] 12 corresponds to one of the<br>
	entries in the grammar type indicator based upon a user prompt provided io the end<br>
	user across Che client device 100. In other words, the user is requested (o provide a<br>
	speech input U0 that is expected to fall within (he grammar class.<br>
		[0023] Thereupon, step 136, speech recognition is limited to the embedded<br>
	speech recognition engine or the external speech recognition engine based on the<br>
	grammar type indicator in comparison io a grammar type capability signal. A<br>
	grammar type capability signal includes an indication of recognition complexity level<br>
	of the embedded speech recognition engine. The recognition complexity \cva)<br>
	corresponds to how many words, or phrases the speech fecognizer can handle using<br>
	the available device resources, The recognition complexity increases as the<br>
	racQgrtiiaWe lartguagt s« msreaees. Usually rtva T<ic phiases art tcprtaemetl></ic>
	far the speech recognizer needs as a. finite state network of nodes and arcs. The<br>
	recognition complexity level would be, for example, that the recognition is limited to<br>
	euch networks of 50 nodes. There exiEte other implementations awi variations of thfl<br>
	recognition complexity level that could be applied and would fall within the scope of<br>
	this disclosure. As such, the speech recognition ta be performed by cither the<br>
	embedded speech recognition engine 106 or the external speech recognition engine<br>
	114 is thereupon selectively distributed based upon the expected complexity of the<br>
	speech input 110 as determined by the grammar type indicator 114 and the grammar<br>
	type indicator entries, step 208.<br>
		[0024] FIG. 3 illustrates the apparatus for selective distributed speech<br>
	recognition of FIG, 1 with a communication network 140 and an information network<br>
	142, wherein the information network 142 includes acommunicaiion server 144, the<br>

	164 to me dialog manager 104. The application instructions may contain, for<br>
	example, instructions to provide connection with the communication server 144 and<br>
	provide the terminal capability signal Lo the communication server 144. In another<br>
	embodiment, the processor 150 may be disposed within the dialog manager 104 and<br>
	receives the- executable instructions 162 directly within the dialog manager 104.<br>
		[0031] As discussed above, when the dialog manager 104 receives the<br>
	encoded audio input 112, based upon the grammar 114 of FIG. I, the dialog manager<br>
	L04 selects either the embedded speech recognition engine 106 or the external speech<br>
	recognition engine 1QB, When the external speech recognition engine 10S is. selected,<br>
	the encoded audio input 118 is provided to the interface 156 such that it may be<br>
	transmitted to the external speech recognition engine 10S across the communication<br>
	network 140. The interface 156 provides for a wireless communication 166 and<br>
	thereupon the wireless device 100 may provide a communication 168 to the<br>

	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	receives the encoded audio input 1 IS, the encoded audio input 1L3 is recognized, in<br>
	accordance with known speech recognition techniques. The recognized audio input<br>
	169 is thereupon provided back to the dialog manager 104. Once again, as recognized<br>
	by one having ordinary skill in the art. the recognized audio inpm 169 may be<br>
	provided through the communication server 144 through the communStation network<br>
	140 and back to the interface 156 within the wireless device 100.<br>
		[0033] In another embodiment, the embedded speech recognition engine 106<br>
	or the external speech recognition ] OS, based upon which engine is selected by the<br>
	dialog manager 104, may be provided anN-best list to the dialog manager and further<br>
	level of feedback: may be performed, wherein the user is provided the top choices far<br>
	recognized audio and thereupon further selects the appropriate recognized input or the<br>
	user can select an action to correct the input if the desired input is not present,<br>
		[0034] FIG. 5 illustrates the method for distributed speech recognition in<br>
	accordance with one embodiment. The method begins 200 by providing a. terminal<br>
	capability signal to a communication server, wherein the terminal capability signal is<br>
	provided across a communication network, step 203. As illustrated with respect to<br>
	FIG. 3. the terminal capability signal is provided from the dialog manager 104<br>
	through the interface 156 across the communication network 140 to the<br>
	communication server 144, In one embodiment, the terminal capability signal is.<br>
	provided as part of the service session initiation that happens when the wireless<br>
	device 100 connects to the communication server 144. The next step, step 204, is<br>
	receiving a mark-tip page having a grammar type indicator having al leasLone<br>
	grammar class entry with a plurality of grammar class entries associated therewith.<br>
	The mark-up page may be encoded with any recognized mark-tip language, such as,<br>
	but not limited to, VoiceXML, SALT and XHTML, with the grammar type indicators,<br>
	such as grammar type indicators 170, 172 and 174 of FIG. 4.<br>
		[0035] Thereupon an information request js provided to an output device,<br>
	wherein the information request seeks a speech input of one of the at !ea&amp;t one<br>
	grammar class envies, step 206. As discussed with respect to FIG. 3, the information<br>
	request 160 is provided to the output device 154 and the speech input 110 is typically<br>
11<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	provided from an end user. The next step is receiving si speech input, step 208. The<br>
	speech input 110 is typically provided by an end user and is expected to correspond to<br>
	at least one of the grammar class entries, for example with respect to FIG. 4, the<br>
	speech input would be expected to be ore of the grammar class entries, such as<br>
	Monday or Tuesday for the first grammar class 170.<br>
		[0036] An encoded audio input is generated from the speech input, step 210.<br>
	In one embodiment, XXX audio receiver 102 receives the speech input 110 and<br>
	thereupon generates the encoded audio input 112. The next step, step 212, is selecting<br>
	an embedded speech recognition engine OF an external speech recognition engine<br>
	based on the gramctifir type Indicator. In one embodiment, the dialog manager 104<br>
	makes this selection based on the grammar type indicators received within the originaJ<br>
	mark-up page. Thus, the encoded audio inpui is provided to the selected speech<br>
	recognition engine.<br>
		[0037] The next step, step 216, is receiving a recognized voice input from<br>
	either the embedded speech recognition engine or the external speech recognition<br>
	engine, based upon which speech recognition engine was chosen and the encoded<br>
	audio input provided thereto. The dialog manager 104 receives the recognized voice<br>
	input and associates the recognized voice input as an entry fora specific field.<br>
		[0038] In one embodiment, the method for selective distributed speech<br>
	recognition further includes providing a second information request to the output<br>
	device, in response In the second grammar type indicator, step 2IS. The second<br>
	information request seeks a second speech input, such as the speech input 110,<br>
	typically provided by an end user. Thereupon, the second speech input is received<br>
	within the audio receiver 102, step 220. The audio receiver once again generates a<br>
	second encoded audio inpul, step 222 and provides the encoded audio input to the<br>
	dialog manager 104 whereupon she dialog manager once again selects either the<br>
	embedded speech recognition engine 106 or the external speech recognition engine<br>
	105 based on the grammar type indicator, step 224, The second encoded audio input<br>
	is provided to the selected speech recognition engine, step 226. As such, a second<br>
12<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	recognized audio input is generated and provided back to the dialog manager 104<br>
	from the selected speech recognition engine.<br>
		[0039] Thereupon, the method is complete, step 228, As recognized by one<br>
	having ordinary still in the art, the method for selective distributed speech recognition<br>
	Is continued for each grammar type indicator. For example, if the mark-up page<br>
	contains ten fields, the dialog manager would seek ten speech inputs and the audio<br>
	receiver 102 would generate len different encoded audio inputs and the dialog<br>
	manager 104- would thereupon choose at iftn different intervals for each specific<br>
	grammar lype indicator which specific speech recognition engine to perform the<br>
	selective speech recognition.<br>
		[0040] FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary method for selective, distributed speech<br>
	recognition using the embodiment of a financial services network. The method<br>
	begins, step 230, when a user accesses a network for financial services, step 232.<br>
	Next, the server acknowledges access and provides Che dialog manager an application<br>
	specific mark-up page and at least one application specific grammar type indicator,<br>
	step 234. In response thereto, the dialog manager queries the user for a speech input<br>
	based on the first grammar class, step 236,<br>
		[0041] The user provides the audio input to the audio receiver, step 238. The<br>
	wireless device thereupon distributes the first audio input to the first speech<br>
	recognition engine based on the first grammar cype indicator, step 240. In this<br>
	embodiment, the first grammar type indicator contains an indication to have the<br>
	encoded audio input recognized bv the embedded speech recognition engine based<br>
	upon the complexity of the grammar class entries,<br>
		[0042] Next, the dialog manager queries the user for a second speech input<br>
	based on a. second, grammar class step 242. The user provides the second audio input<br>
	to the audio receiver, step 244. The wireless device distributes the second audio input<br>
	to the second speech recognition engine based on the second grammar type indicator,<br>
	step 246, wherein the second gtiammar type indicator indicates a level of complexity<br>
	beyond the speech recognition capabilities of the embedded speech recognition<br>
13<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
	engine. Once again, the dialog manager queries the user for a third speech input, this<br>
	lime based on a third grammar class, step 248, The user provides the third audio input<br>
	LO the audio receiver, step 250. The wirtle&amp;s device distributes the third audio input to<br>
	ihe first speech recognition engine based on the third grammar type indicator, wherein<br>
	the third grammar type indicator, similar to the fits! grammar type indicator indicates<br>
	recognition capabilities wi in in the ability of the embedded speech recognition engine<br>
	106. Thereupon, the method is complete, step 254 and all of the entries for the<br>
	application specific mark-up page have been completed,<br>
		[0043] .FIG. 7 illustrates one example of another embodiment of a method for<br>
	selective distributed speech recognition. The method begins, step 2G0, by receiving<br>
	an embedded speech recognition engine capability signal, step 262, As discussed<br>
	above, the embedded speech recognition engine capability signal indicates the level of<br>
	complexity of which the embedded speech recognition engine within the wireless<br>
	device may properly and effectively recognize an included audio input. The next<br>
	step, step 262, includes retrieving a mark-up page having at least one entry field,<br>
	wherein at least one of the entry fields includes at least one of a plurality of grammar<br>
	classes associated therewith. The at least one entry field includes fields for an<br>
	interactive mark-up page wherein a user typically provides an input to the entry field.<br>
		[0044] The next step is comparing the at least one of the plurality of grammar<br>
	classes with the embedded speech recognition engine capability signal, step 266,<br>
	Thereupon, for each entry field having at least one of the plurality of grammar classes<br>
	associated therewith, assigning either the embedded speech recognition engine or an<br>
	external speech recognition engine to conduct die speech recognition, based upon the<br>
	embedded speed recognition capability signal, step 26S.<br>
		[0045] Thereupon, for each entry field having at least one of the plurality of<br>
	grammar classes associated therewith, the method includes inserting a grammar type<br>
	indicator within the mark-up page, wherein the grammar type indicator includes either<br>
	a grammar class, a grammar indicator, a speech recognition pointer, or any other<br>
	suitable notation capable of directing a dialog manager or multi-modaJ browser to a<br>
	particular speech recognition engine, step 270.<br>
14<br><br>
	WO 2004/061819							PCT/US2003/037898<br>
		[0046] There upon, step 272, the mark-up page is provided to a wireless<br>
	device, such a$ the wireless device 100 of FIG- U Furthermore, the method includes<br>
	receiving an encoded audio input for each of the Entry fields having a grammar type<br>
	indicator that indicates the selection of the external speech recognition engine, step<br>
	274,<br>
		[0047] The method further includes providing th&amp; encoded audio input to the<br>
	external speech recognition engine, step 276. Thereupon, the encoded audio input is<br>
	recognised, step XJ8 and a recognized, audio input is provided tf&gt; ttie 'wireless device,<br>
	step 230. Thereupon, the method Tor selected distribution from the perspective of a<br>
	communication server, such as communication server 144 of FIG, 3 is complete.<br>
		[0048] In another embodiment, the grammar type indicator, such as 170. is<br>
	embedded within the mark-up page provided to the wireless device 100, such that the<br>
	wireless device 100 may selectively choose which speech recognition engine is<br>
	coabled based an art ambaddad speech tsaognUiart engine capability signal.<br>
	Furthermore, one embodiment allows for a user to override the selected speech<br>
	recognition through the active de&gt;$c lection of the selected speech recognition engine.<br>
	For example, the embedded speech recognition 106 may be unreliable due to excess<br>
	ambient noise, therefore even though [he embedded speech recognition engine 106<br>
	may be selected, the external speech recognition 108 may be utilised. In another<br>
	embodiment, the wireless device 100 may provide a zero capability signal which<br>
	represents the terminal capability signal indicates the embedded speech recognition<br>
	engine 106 have zero recognition capability, in essence providing for all speech<br>
	recognition to be per formed by the external speech recognition engine 108,<br>
