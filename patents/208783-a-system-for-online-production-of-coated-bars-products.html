				<td>THE PATENTS ACT,  1970<br>
(39 of 1970)<br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra,  India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for providing coated cleansing/ cosmetic products so as to maintain the desired shape and characteristics of the product during storage and usage. In particular, the system of the invention can be used to provide in a simple .cost-effective and safe manner coated shaped solid detergent composition for cleaning hard surfaces or fabric or for personal wash or coated antiperspirant / deodorant products in the form of soft solids.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is commonly found that detergent / cleansing bars or cosmetic products have problems of loss of shape / form / characteristics due to absorption of water during storage and /or while in use such as detergent bars used for cleaning hard surfaces / fabrics / personal cleansing.<br>
In our co-pending application no. 417/MUM/2001 there is disclosed a shaped detergent composition wherein the external surfaces of such shaped detergent article are covered with one or more materials that are substantially water insoluble, such materials having melting point higher than 30°C and being adherent to the external surface and capable of being abraded during use.<br>
In our another co-pending application no. 1131 /MUM/2001 the coated shaped detergent composition is selectively provided wherein the external surface comprise at least one selective polymer film generated using radiation curable composition.<br>
In our other co-pending application no. 953/MUM/2002, there is disclosed yet another solid shaped detergent composition wherein the external surface of said shaped detergent composition comprises at least one polymer coating that is non radiation-curable material and having a water vapour permeability coefficient for water less than<br><br><br>
5000 X 10'13. where [Cm3] is = Cm3(273,15K; 1,013 X 105 Pa), which<br>
is substantially water insoluble whose melting point is greater than 30°C that is adherent to the external surface but is capable o^ be\ng abraded during use.<br>
In our other co-pending application no. 954/MUM/2002 there is disclosed solid shaped anti-perspirant / deodorant composition wherein the external surface of said shaped aritiperspirant/deodorant composition comprises at least one coating that is substantially water insoluble whose melting point is greater than 30°C that is non-irritant to the skin, adherent to the external surface but is capable of being abraded during use.<br>
While in our above applications, the various compositions such as detergents / cleansing bar and/or cosmetic / antiperspirant / deodorant formulations in the form of coated products are proposed for better storage stability and in-use performance, there has been a need for developments/ improvements in the methods for manufacture of such coated products.<br>
In our co-pending application no. 955/MUM/2002 there is disclosed a method for producing coated bars of varied formulations such as detergent/cleansing formulations having at least one surface portion thereof having a water resistant coat comprising:<br>
i.	subjecting   the   preformed   bar   of   desired   shape/configuration   and<br>
formulation to step of coating using the said polymeric coat material preferably UV/EB curable coat material;<br>
ii. Curing the thus coated polymeric bar to thereby obtain the coated bars of desired water barrier coat / surface finish.<br><br><br>
It would be apparent from the aforesaid that the method of coating detergent / cleansing bars and/or antiperspirant / cosmetic formulations essentially involve the provision of subjecting the preformed cosmetic / detergent formulations to a step of controlled coating by the selective coating material and finally subjecting the coated bars of the product to a controlled curing to finally obtain bars with desired water barrier coat / surface finish.<br>
In our said co-pending application 955/MUM/2002, there is also disclosed a system useful for producing such coated bars comprising :<br>
means for subjecting at least a selective portion of preformed bars to a<br>
water barrier coat preferably UV / EB coat;<br>
means for curing the thus provided UV / EB coated bars ;<br>
As also disclosed in our said co-pending application the liquid coating application is carried out in a coating application chamber wherein the preformed bars are allowed to traverse on a conveyor means and the coating material is spread on to the bar by a spraying unit. Subsequently, after the coating is attended the coated bars are then allowed to traverse to the curing chamber where the curing is attended by use of UV lamps.<br>
While the basic methodology and the means involved for producing such coated bars are disclosed in our above co-pending applications, importantly taking into account the required spraying and UV curing of the coated bars, it is important to ensure that the coating is attended uniformly at the pre-selected sides of the bar and also the curing is complete and uniform and is carried out efficiently to ensure safe and cost effective generation of such coated bars.<br>
Importantly, it is found that for the purpose of spraying of the coating material under pressure on the coated bar, with or without utilising air. It is noted that there is a substantial loss of the coating material involved during spray coating of<br><br><br>
the preformed bars in the spraying operation where only a fraction of the material is actually utilised for the coating while the remaining is blown off the target thereby leading to a loss of expensive coating material. It is therefore important to ensure that the liquid coating content from the spraying unit is effectively utilised and the unutilised liquid coat material is recovered to the extent possible for subsequent use. Morevover, it is also found that while the coating chamber is supposed to be maintained under slight negative pressure to avoid escaping of spray mist, it is often difficult to ensure leak proof chambers considering the involvement of chemicals and the subjects to be coated. This, therefore, further lead to loss of the coating material which add on to the product cost. Importantly also in view of use of an UV light source as a curing media, it is again difficult and important to ensure that the disposition of the UV light sources and the arrangement of the UV curing chamber is such that there is no harmful exposure of UV light for the operator.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide for a system which would enable efficient ,safe and cost -effective generation of such coated bars.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a system for producing film coated bars / cosmetic products which would ensure that the coating mater/a/ is effectively utilised for coating purposes and the unutilised sprayed coat material is effectively retrieved and recycled for subsequent use.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for producing film coated bars / cosmetic products whereby it would be possible to effectively remove the sprayed mist of the coated material during the coating operation from the coating chamber which would ensure on one hand effective utilisation of the coating material and on the other hand, would not disturb the desired direction of spraying of the coating material under pressure on to the subject to be coated.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for producing coated bars / cosmetic products involving spray coating technique wherein there would be effective utilisation of the coating material and recovery of the unutilised spray coating material both in terms of spray mist and also as liquid droplets from the conveyor.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a system for producing a coated bar / product involving spray technique which would involve a safe leak proof coating chamber.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a system for producing a coated bar / product which would provide for safe and effective UV curing and would favour energy efficient, removal of the heat from the UV curing chambers thereby imparting better flexibility and efficiency in producing coated bars / products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspects of the present invention there is provided a system for online production of coated bars / products comprising :<br>
a coating chamber for coating of preformed bars / products comprising a conveyor means traversing there through to carry the preformed bars through said coating chamber, said chamber having an inlet and an outlet for carrying the preformed bars through the coating chamber from said inlet to said outlet; means for spraying the coat material on said preformed bars traversing on the conveyor in said coating chamber; demisting means operatively connected to an arrangement for double segment suction for differential mist removal at entry and exit in said coating chamber; means for collection of the unutilised sprayed coating material for effective recycling for subsequent spraying ;and<br>
6<br><br>
an UV curing chamber operatively connected to said coating chamber for on-line effective curing of the coated pars exiting from said coating chamber.<br>
Importantly in the above system of the invention, the coating chamber is selectively provided with an efficient arrangement of double segment suction for differential mist removal at entry and exit points of the chamber. For the purpose, the entry and the exit portion of the coating chamber is provided with the compartmentalized entry and exit points wherein at the lower end of the compartmented entry point adjacent to the conveyor entry point, there is provided plurality of openings which communicate with the compartmented entry zone which in turn is operatively connected to the demister by tubular means for effective suction of the spray mist at and around the entry . Likewise at the exit point of the conveyor carrying the coated bar the coating chamber exit is compartmented so as to facilitate mist removal at the exit point through said compartmented exit   operatively connected to the demister.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that the selective arrangement of the double segment suction at the entry and the exit of the coating chamber provides for differential mist removal at the entry and exit zone without in any manner affecting the spraying process involving spray of the coated content under pressure on the preformed bars. Such differential mist removal is supposed to avoid loss of the expensive coating material on one hand and facilitate the coating process from the spray guns without disturbing its direction of spray and thereby ensuring efficient spraying and coating of the preformed product.<br>
Advantageously, the coating chamber is further provided with the effective leak proof door having secured leak proof glass panels for viewing of the spray process and its monitoring. For the purpose, the leak proof door is provided with inflatable gasket that is compatible with the coating material.<br><br><br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for producing film coated bar/ product comprising :<br>
a coating chamber for coating of preformed bars / products comprising a conveyor means traversing there through to carry the preformed bars through said coating chamber, said chamber having an inlet and an outlet for carrying the preformed bars through the coating chamber from said inlet to said outlet ;means for spraying the coat material on said preformed bars traversing on the conveyor in said coating chamber; demisting means operatively connected to an arrangement for double segment suction for differential mist removal at entry and exit in said coating chamber; means for collection of the unutilised sprayed coating material for effective recycling for subsequent spraying ;and<br>
an UV curing chamber operatively connected to said coating chamber comprising microwave fired UV light energy delivery means adapted for immediate on/off of the UV source to favour effective control of the process.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred aspect the UV curing chamber is provided with an integral cool/ ambient air blowing unit and a hot air suction unit which facilitate efficient heat management during the curing process. Importantly the additional suction unit would facilitate heat removal apart from the hot air disposal from the entry and exit points of the UV curing chamber. This would provide greater flexibility and control over the heat management during UV curing and avoid problems of excessive heat and/or bar / product burn out or melting.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the operative connection between the coating chamber conveyor carrying the coated bars and the conveyor of the UV curing chamber carrying the coated bars further into the UV chamber is achieved by means of an intermediate conveyor which is provided a knife edge roller to facilitate transfer of the bars from the coating<br><br><br>
chamber into the UV chamber and ensure proper alignment and disposition of the bars exiting from the coating chamber and entering the UV chamber for effective curing.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the system for producing film coated bars / cosmetic products in accordance with the invention as per the accompanying figures wherein :<br>
Reference is first invited to Figure 1 which illustrates the system for online production of coated bars / products in accordance with the present invention. As shown in said figure, the system involves the coating chamber (CC) which is maintained leak proof and which has an entry point (EP1) through which preformed bars (PB) are allowed to traverse into the coating chamber (CC). A conveyor means (CM1) is used to carry forward such preformed bars (PB) into the coating chamber (CC) and finally exit the coated bars through the exit point (EP2). As disclosed above, the coating chamber at the top is shown to be operatively connected to a demister (DM) to collect the spray mist during this spraying operation, The demister is operatively connected to a flame proof motor coupling.<br>
importantly, in accordance with the present invention the coating chamber is provided with a selective arrangement of double segments suction for differential mist removal at entry and exit. For the purpose as illustrated in Figure 2, the entry and exit points of the coating chamber are provided with hollow compartmented zones, the entry zone (EZ) and the exit zone (EXZ). As would be apparent, these entry and exit zones found in the coating chamber at the lower end adjacent the conveyor is provided with openings which communicate with internal of the respective zones, said zones being further operatively connected to the demister through tubular pipes (TP). Such a system of providing suction means at the entry and exit zone of the coating chamber takes<br><br><br>
care of achieving on one hand double segment suction for differentia) mist removal at entry and exit and on the other hand, avoids the problem of disturbing the spraying process usually encountered in case of high suction at the inside of the coating chamber.<br>
As further illustrated in said Figures 1 and 2, to facilitate the collection of unutilised coating material on the conveyor, there is provided scrapper means (SM) and also a collection zone (CZ) there under the conveyor which accumulates the collected unutilised coating material for subsequent recycling for the spraying process.<br>
The selective double segment suction for differential mist removal at entry and exit point and the further collection of unutilised coating material, it is possible to effectively utilise the liquid coating material and improve upon the ratio of the utilised to unutilised coating material in the process of spraying.<br>
Also illustrated in said figure 1 and 2 is the selective disposition of a leak proof viewing means (VM) in the coating chamber. For the purpose, a selective leak proof door is developed comprising an inflatable gasket that is compatible with the coating material and formed therein the viewing means comprising a glass panel permanently secured to the stainless steel frame. Also the releasable door is again provided with leak proof sealing arrangement.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 1 wherein the UV curing chamber (UVC) is shown to be operatively connected to the coating chamber. For the purpose the UV curing chamber is provided with a conveyor means (CM3) which has an inlet for entering the coated bars for curing and an outlet (EP2) for exiting the coated and cured bars. As shown in said figure, the present invention advantageously provides for microwave based UV light delivery system as the curing source for the coated bars. Such a microwave based UV light delivery system can provide for efficient and fast switching on and off of the UV<br><br><br>
light source to thereby have better control over the curing process. The disposition of the UV light delivery system is such that it on one hand it achieves effective and uniform curing of the coating and on the other hand ensures that the operators are not exposed to any unwanted UV radiation.<br>
Advantageously, the UV curing chamber is also provided with effective means for heat management. For the purpose a ambient air/ cold air blowing means (CBM) and a hot air suction (HAS) are provided which together facilitate better heat management during the curing process to avoid problems of excessive heat and bar burn out/ product melting.<br>
As also illustrated in Figure 1, to facilitate online uniform transfer of the coated bars from the coating chamber conveyor (CM1) and to the UV curing chamber conveyor (CM3) and an intermediate conveyor (CM2) is provided having knife edge delivery / transfer by means of cooperating small and large pulley conveyor.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to achieve for an online system for producing coated bars / products such as detergent bars, antiperspirant / deodorant products and the like which would be cost effective in terms of better utilisation of expensive coating material, energy efficient, adapted to provide high throughput rate and safe and user friendly to operate and use.<br><br><br>
