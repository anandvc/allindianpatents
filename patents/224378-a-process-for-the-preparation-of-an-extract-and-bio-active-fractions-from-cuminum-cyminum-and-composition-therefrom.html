The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an extract and bio-active fraction from Cuminum cyminum and a bioavailability/ bioefficacy enhancing composition comprising the said extract/ bio-active fraction from Cuminum cyminum along with piperine/ extract or bio-active fraction from Piper nigrum or Piper longum.<br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing extract and/or bioactive fractions from the plant Cuminum cyminum as a bioavailability enhancer. The present invention also relates to a composition containing extract and/or bioactive fractions from the plant Cuminum cyminum with piperine as a bioavailability enhancer. The present invention in addition relates to the use of bioavailability and/or bioefficacy enhancers - also termed as bioenhancers or BE and methods of their preparation which include their isolation from a natural source and obtaining the final products in their chemically characterized or fingerprint- profiled form. Description of related art<br>
Several approaches have been adopted in the past to maximize oral bioavailability, such as (a) particle size reduction (micronization, nanonization, etc.,) (b) polymorphic or crystal size and form selection, (c) solubilization of lesser soluble drugs by way of chemical modifications, complexation and use of co-solvents/ surfactants, (d) targeted delivery of drug at the site of action, (e) controlled drug delivery by film coating or use of polymeric matrices for sustained release of drugs, (0 prodrug approach, and (g) micro-encapsulation using liposomes.<br>
However, based on clues from Ayurvedic literature, a new approach of increasing the bioavailability of drugs including poorly-bioavailable drugs had been conceptualized at applicants institute Regional Research Laboratory (RRL), Jammu. One of the groups of herbals which has been documented very frequently as essential part of about 70 % of Ayurvedic prescriptions, was noted to be Trikatu', that comprises three acrids viz. long pepper, black pepper and dry ginger in equal proportions. A single major alkaloidal constituent from peppers (piperine) was found to be responsible for bioavailability enhancing effect. The role of ginger is to regulate intestinal function to facilitate absorption. Influence of piperine was extensively studied on anti-TB drugs. It was determined that in combination with piperine, the dose of rifampicin can be reduced by about 50% while retaining the therapeutic efficacy of this anti-TB drug at par with the standard dose (450 mg). Based on these findings several other reputed plants were evaluated for bioavailability/ bioefficacy<br><br>
enhancing activity. Polar and non-polar extracts of parts of a few plants viz..<br>
Zingiber officinale, and Carum carvi increased significantly (25 - 300 %),<br>
[Applicants co-pending patent applications] the bioavailability of a number of classes<br>
of drugs, for example, but not limited to. antibiotics, antifungals, anti-virais.<br>
anticancer. cardiovascular, CNS, anti-infiammatory/anti-arthritic, anti-TB/<br>
antileprosy,	anti-histarninic/respiratory	disorders,	corticosteroids,<br>
immunosuppressants, anti-ulcer. Such extracts either in presence or absence of piperine have been found to be highly selective in their bioavailability/ bioefficacy enhancing action.<br>
Cuminum cyminum (Linn.) (Umbelliferae) is a small, slender annual herb, which is grown extensively in South-Eastern Europe, North Africa bordering the Mediterranean-sea, in India and China. It is cultivated in almost all the states in India. The chief areas are reported to be U.P., Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The plant prefers a mild climate and grows from sea level up to an elevation of 10,000 feet.<br>
Its seeds have been used as an important condiment. In Ayurveda it is documented as katu. ushna and paoifies deranged vata. It is an effective gastric stimulant, beneficial in abdominal lump, flatulence, diarrhoea, sprue and a strong anthelmintic. It has therapeutically been used as an anti-diarrhoea), ga'actagoguc, diuretic and also beneficial in hoarseness of voice, it is also used lringent, carminative. Paste of seeds when applied externally worms in the abdomen. Oil is useful in eczema.<br>
Based on our past experience with the development of piperine as bioavailability enhancer from plants which are otherwise part of human diet and also documented to possess medicinal properties, we took up this plant to evaluate its bioavailability enhancing effect, if any, based on its attributes bearing some similarities to the plant sources of piperine. Chemistry of Cuminum cyminum<br>
The seeds of Cuminum cyminum were analyzed and it was reported that, analytical contents of seeds are (in percentage): moisture 11.9; protein 18.7; ether extractive 15.0; carbohydrates 36.6; fibre 12.0; mineral matter 5.8; calcium 1.08; phosphorus 0.49%; iron 31.0 mg/ 100 g; carotene calculated as vitamin A 870 l.U./100gm; and vitamin C 3.0 mg/100 g(HIthBulI.tNo. 23, 1941,36).<br><br>
The seeds on distillation yield a volatile oil (2.0-4.0%) having an unpleasant characteristic odour, spicy and somewhat bitter taste. The oil is colourless or yellow when fresh, turning dark on keeping. The analytical constants of the Indian oil are d l5°- 0.8945; nD25° 1.490; [α]D25°, + 3.60; aldehydes 16 %; the oil is soluble in 11 volume of 80% alcohol at 20°C. The ranges of constants reported by Parry are: sp. gr. 0.900-0.930;<br>
n=l .494-1.507; [α] +3.0 to +8.0°; aldehydes 25-35% (Rao et al. J. Indian Inst. Sci., 1925, 8A, 182; Parry, E.J. "The Chemistry of Essential Oils and Artificial Perfumes" [1921] (Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son Ltd., London) Vol. 1, p.311).<br>
The chief constituent of the volatile oil is cuminaldehyde (C10H12O, p-isopropylbenzaldehyde, b.p. 235°), which forms nearly 20-40% of the oil. Besides the aldehyde, oil contains p-cymene, pinene, dipentene, cumene, cuminic alcohol, ß-phellandrene and a-terpineol. The residue left after the volatile oil extraction contains 17.2% protein and 30.0% fat. It can be used as cattle feed (Finnemore, H. "The — Essential Oils" [1926] (Ernest Benn. Ltd., London) p. 641). Besides volatile oil seeds contains 10% fixed oil, which is greenish brown in color with a strong aromatic flavor.<br>
Other chemical constituent reported are apigenin - 7-glucoside. apigenin -7-diglucosidc, -diglucoside, luteolin- 7,4'-diglucoside and luieolin-7-galacturonide-4'-glucosidc and chrysoeriol glycoside [El-Negoumy, S.I. et al. Grasas Aceites (Seville) 1989, 40 (2) 87-9].<br>
There is a great interest and medical need for the improvement of bioavailability of a large number of drugs, which are (a) poorly bioavailable, (b) administered for long periods, (c) toxic and (d) expensive. Maximizing oral bioavailability is therapeutically important because the extent of bioavailability directly influences plasma concentrations and consequently therapeutic efficacy and dose related toxic effects resulting after oral drug administration. Poorly bioavailable drugs remain sub-therapeutic because a major portion of a dose never reaches the plasma or exerts its pharmacological effect unless and until very large doses are given which may lead to serious side effects. Any si      nt improvement in bioavailability<br>
1<br>
will result in lowering the dose or the dose frequency of that particular drug. Besides,<br><br>
inter-subject variability is inversely correlated with the extent of bioavailability. Therefore, low oral bioavailability leads to high variability and poor control of plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic effects. Inter-subject variability is particularly of concern for a drug with a narrow safety margin.<br>
Incomplete oral bioavailability has various causes. These include poor dissolution or low aqueous solubility, poor intestinal membrane permeation, degradation of the drug in gastric or intestinal fluids and pre-systemic intestinal or hepatic metabolism. The normal practice to offset some of these problems has been to increase the dosage as stated earlier, which has the concerns of toxicity patients' non-compliance.<br>
Many therapeutic treatments are also accompanied by loss of essential nutraceuticals in the course of therapy. The present invention improves nutritional status by increasing bioavailability/ bioefficacy of various nutraceuticals also, which include metals and vitamins. The bioenhancers of the invention also have the potential to enhance the bioefficacy of a drug without influencing its plasma concentrations for various reasons, some of which, but not limited to, are described later in this invention under Section on 'Bioavailability/ Bioenhancing activity',<br>
Bioavailability/bioefficacy enhancing activity<br>
In the present invention, the term Bioavailability or bienhancing (BE) activity is defined as "a product at a lower dosage level which in combination with a drug or nutrient, provides more availability of the drug there by reducing the consumption of the drug or nutrient resulting in enhanced efficacy of the said drug.<br>
In the present invention, the aqueous, aqueous - alcoholic, ketonic, ethereal, halogenated solvent extracts of the plant parts were evaluated with different therapeutic categories of drugs and nutraceutical (vital amino acids, metals, antioxidants, vitamins), and herbal drugs either alone or in combination. The bioavailability enhancing (BE) activity of the extracts was found to be consistent from 2.0 mg to 100 mg irrespective of the amount of the drug(s) present in the formulation. Sub- fractions of the extracts were also evaluated, with the same categories of drugs. The BE activity of the fractions increased corresponding to their proportions in the parent extract. The doses of the fractions responsible for the BE activity ranged from 0.5 to 25.0 mg. Both the fractions were found to be equally active within the above-mentioned range. Both the parent extracts as well as the fractions were found to be<br><br>
active individually as well as in combination with each other with different categories of drugs. The bioenhancer activity of the fraction (s) was found to be consistent from 0.5 mg to 25.0 mg irrespective of the amount of the drug(s) present in the formulation. The BE activity of the fractions was more enhanced as compared to that of the parent extracts.<br>
The extracts or its fractions were found to be upto 50 % more active when used individually in combination with piperine (1- piperoyl piperidine ). Besides, both the parent extracts as wells as their fractions in different combinations showed almost similar enhanced activity upto 60% in presence of piperine. The amount of piperine in these formulations ranged from 3- 20 mg.<br>
The extracts or its fractions either in presence or absence of piperine have been found to be highly selective in their bioavailability enhancing activity. This is apparent from the degree of bioavailibility enhancement caused by these extracts/ fractions. It varies from Nil to nearly significant (25%) to highly significant (435 %). The reasons for this selective pattern may be attributable to one or more than one of the following reasons:<br>
(a)	Promoting the absorption of drugs from GIT,<br>
(b)	Inhibiting or reducing the rate of biotransformation of drugs in the liver or intestines,<br>
(c)	Modifying the immune system in a way that the overall requirement of the drug is reduced substantially,<br>
(d)	Increasing the penetration or the entry into the pathogens even where they become persistors within the macrophages such as for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and such others. This eventually ensures the enhanced killing of these organisms well secured within the places otherwise inaccessible to the active drug,<br>
(e)	Inhibiting the capability of pathogens or abnormal tissue to reject the drug e.g., efflux mechanisms frequently encountered with anti-malarial, anti¬cancer and anti-microbial drugs,<br>
(f)	Modifying the signalling process between host and pathogen ensuring increased accessibility of the drugs to the pathogens,<br>
(g)	Enhancing the binding of the drug with the target sites such as receptors, proteins, DNA, RNA, and the like in the pathogen, thus potentiating and<br><br>
prolonging its effect leading to enhanced antibiotic activity against pathogens, (h) Besides above plausible modes of action, the bioenhancer agents may also be useful for promoting the transport of nutrients and the drugs across the blood brain barrier , which could be of immense help in the control of diseases like cerebral infections, epilepsy and other CNS problems.<br>
Primarily, but not exclusively, the invention enhances the carrier mediated entry of drugs and also the passive diffusion and the active transport pathways in the tissue which are responsible for transporting physiological substances such as nutraceuticals to their target sites. As applicable to any mechanism of action the products of this invention contribute in a synergistic and /or additive manner so that most drugs and nutraceuticals in presence of the products described in the present art are more bioavailable or bioefficaceous as a result of one or more of these mechanisms. The bioavailability and/ or bioefficacy of drugs and nutraceuticals is also relevant to animal health besides being important for humans. The invention therefore is also intended to be used in veterinary preparations.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The   following  examples  are   intended  to  demonstrate  some   of the   preferred embodiments and in no way should be construed so as to limit the scope of the invention. Any person skilled in the art can design more formulations, which may be considered as part of the present invention. Example 1<br>
Preparation of colourless, non-pungent piperine by a novel process as already claimed in IP 1726890 and further modified as follows: Commercially available Piper nigrum or Piper longum or their oleoresins have been used as the source material. 20 kg long pepper oleoresin is extracted with chlorinated solvents like CHC13, CH2Cl2, C2H4Cl2 (25 litre) for six hours or 20 kg black pepper powder is Soxhleitcd v. ith toluene for 8 hours. The extracts are concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and dissolved in ethanol at 78° C. The ethanolic solution is adsorbed over neutral Al2O3 and packed in a glass column. Elation is carried out with CHCI3: EtOH (9.1) and the eluate is concentrated to dryness and dissolved in minimum quantity of ethanol. The solution is treated with activated charcoal and filtered through a celite bed. The filtrate is concentrated to saturation point, cooled when colourless crystalline precipitate is obtained. The precipitate is separated by suction filtration and dried.<br>
Example 2:<br>
The specifications of the preferred materials are as under:<br>
Piperine<br>
Colour	:	Colourless, monoclinic prismatic crystals;<br>
Melting point	:	129°C-30°C<br>

Example 3<br>
Doses, models/design of experiments and estimation methodology in a typicai experiment is given below:<br>
DOSES OF DIFFERENT BIOENHANCERS USED AND THE DESIGN OF A TYPICAL EXPERIMENT<br>
1.	Bioenhancers (BEs) from Cuminum cyminum means either the aqueous, or 50% alcoholic extract or fractions No.l to 5.<br>
2.	Piperine as Bioenhancer (BE) from Piper species means the molecule with characteristics as described in Example 2 of this invention.<br>
3.	In case of Cuminum cyminum, not withstanding the difference in dose of extract or its fraction, the enhancement caused in the bioavailability of the drug with which they are combined remains nearly the same, because the dose of the fraction used is proportionate to its concentration in the extract.<br>
4.	The doses remained either unchanged or were reduced by 50% even when the bioenhancers (BEs) were used in combination with each other.<br>
Example 4; Doses:<br>
(i)        Bioenhancer (BE) from Cuminum cyminum<br>
Extract:	16 mg4.g body weight (Rats)<br>
Fraction No.I:          02-5mg/ kg body weight (rats)<br>
Fraction No.2:	13-mg/ kg body weight (Rats)<br>
Fraction No. 3:	8 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
Fraction No. 4:	5 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
Fraction No. 5:	2.5 to 5 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
(ii)      Piperine	:	8 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
As an example of an experiment in Rat (fasted):<br>
Drug	:	Rifampicin, 40 mg/kg<br>
BE (Cuminum cyminum)      :	Doses   as   in   Example  No.   5<br>
above.<br>
BE {Cuminum cyminum) + Piperine: Doses as in Example No. 5<br>
above.<br>
Experimental   procedure:   Drug  alone/  or   in   combination   with   BE   was administered to rats as per the following design:<br>
Group 1: Control<br>
Group 2: Rifampicin alone<br>
Group 3: BE alone<br>
Group 4: Rifampicin + BE {Cuminum cyminum)<br><br>
Group 5: Rifampicin + BE (C.cyminutn + piperine )<br>
Blood from control/ treated animals at predetermined intervals (0- 24 hrs) (Total 14 timings). Rifampicin was extracted from the blood (plasma) using dichloromethane. The concentration of rifampicin in the samples was determined using HPLC (Mode!: Shimadzu 1080 BP) ; PDA detector; Mobile phase : phosphate buffer: acetonitile (40:60); Flow rate 1.0 ml/min. Column RP 18.<br>
Control and BE only groups were employed to study the interference of plasma component and the bioenhancer used.<br>
