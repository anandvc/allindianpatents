or 2-[(1 R)-3-[bis(1 -methylethyl)amino]-1 -phenylpropyl]-4-methylphenol and its salts are muscarinic receptor antagonists. Tolterodine tartrate is a muscarinic receptor antagonist and is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Tolterodine tartrate and related compounds and their therapeutic uses are disclosed in EP 0325571.<br>
Polymorphs of tolterodine tartrate were not reported in the literature. So, there is a need for stable, well-defined and reproducible crystalline forms.<br>
It has now been discovered that tolterodine tartrate can be prepared In four well-defined and consistently reproducible crystalline forms and one stable amorphous form.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide stable novel polymorphs of tolterodine tartrate, processes for preparing these forms and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
