"TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE TRAILER"<br><br>
GARNTED<br>
9/3/2006<br><br>
CHRISTOPHE WIjTSCHI, of Kerlogne, F-56230 Le Cours, France.<br>
The following specification particularly describes  the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed:	<br><br><br>
The present invention concerns a trailer for a two-wheeler.<br><br>
This trailer is used to enable the driver of a two-wheeler to carry additional loads, such as luggage.<br>
There already exists equipment for carrying luggage for two-wheelers. These are generally borne by the rear upper portion of the two-wheeler and result in<br>
significant  unbalanced  states  when  the  vehicle  is<br><br>
running. For example, this equipment may appear in the<br>
form of 'boxes mounted at the rear of the vehicle. These<br>
boxes have particular securing means according to the<br>
type of two-wheeler,  the installation of said means<br>
often proving to be fastidious. The volume capacity of<br>
these boxes is of necessity reduced. In addition, these<br><br>
boxes adversely affect the aesthetic qualities of the two-wheeler.<br>
The object of the present invention is to resolve said problems by proposing a device for carrying additional loads for a two-wheeler able to be adapted to all types of two-wheelers, being fast to mount and dismantle; and in particular providing the vehicle with good balance conditions when said vehicle is used.<br>
To this effect, the present invention concerns a trailer for a two-wheeler and including means for being secured on the vehicle.<br>
According to the invention, the means for securing the trailer on the vehicle are arranged in the form of a clamp with two arms whose front extremities are shaped so as to cooperate with the extremities of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of the vehicle, the trailer comprising means for clamping said arms adapted<br><br>
to keep! the front extremities of said arms engaged with the extremities of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of the vehicle.<br>
Thus, the securing of the trailer on the vehicle<br>
is effected on the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of<br>
the vehicle, which allows the vehicle equipped with the<br>
trailer to retain its balance qualities. The<br>
arrangement in the form of a clamp of the securing<br>
means of the trailer makes it possible to install the<br>
trailer quickly and easily by acting solely on the<br>
clamping means of the arms.	'<br>
According to one preferred characteristic' of the invention, each of the arms of the clamp bear at its front extremity an end piece which has been shaped to cooperate with one extremity of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of the vehicle, said end piece being able to be dismantled and rotates freely' with respect to said arm.<br><br>
Thus, the trailer could be adapted to all types of<br>
existing vehicles and shall enable a user to select an<br>
end piece adapted to the extremity of the rotation<br>
shaft of his vehicle.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic of the invention, the trailer comprises at its front portion a coupling support including said securing means and said clamping means, and. at its rear portion a chassis joint-connected with respect to said coupling support and bearing a wheel.<br>
Thus, the joint of said chassis with respect to the coupling support enables a vehicle equipped with a trailer to retain its balance qualities, especially in curved trajectories, and in addition makes it possible to limit the stresses exerted by the additional load on the vehicle by virtue of it being possible to add to<br><br>
the device dampers between the coupling support and the chassis.<br>
In one first embodiment of the invention, said arms are joined and said securing means include a strap adapted to surround said articulated arms<br>
 Thus, the clamping of the clamp is effected simply  This practical inexpensive embodiment is particularly well-adapted to a bicycle type two-wheeler.<br>
In a second embodiment, said arms are here again articulated and said clamping means comprise two control  cams integral with a horizontal transfer pin and respectively coupled in support on the rear extremities of the two arms, the trailer further comprising means for immobilising said cams on the coupling} support.<br>
Advantageously, the immobilisation means can be a brake, acting on a handle controlling one of the two control bams. Thus, it suffices to activate the handle so as to clamp the two arms on the rear wheel of the vehicle.Moreover, the system for transfer by the cams offers reliability and sturdiness properly adapted to a<br>
motorcycle type two-wheeler for running at high speeds. Advantageously,  said  coupling  support  of  the<br><br>
trailer for a motorcycle comprises a central portion and two mobile portions situated on both sides of said central portion and adapted to move along a horizontal guide rod borne by said central portion, the latter further comprising means for adjusting the spacing between said mobile portions.<br>
Thus, this possibility of adjusting the width of the coupling support makes it possible to adapt the amplitude of the spacing of the clamp to the dimensions of the rear wheel of the two-wheeler.  It could be<br><br>
possible to adapt the trailer to all types of two-wheelers.<br>
In  a third embodiment, said arms of the securing means of said coupling support have their rear extremity forming a head mounted sliding on a transversal rod, said clamping means symmetrically moving said arms when the latter move closer together or further away.<br>
Advantageously, the sliding extremities of said arms are heads engaged on said transversal rod which ensures ion clamping a "clamp" locking. The clamping means can comprise a rod with inverted threadings respectively engaged in each of said arms.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic of<br>
the  invention,  said  chassis  comprising  a  girder<br><br>
including a front section and a rear section differing<br><br>
from each other, the two sections being adapted for one<br>
to slidei into the other, thus giving the chassis a<br>
telescopic structure,  the trailer further comprising<br>
means fdr locking the two sections, front and rear,<br>
with respect to each other. Advantageously,  the  trailer  comprises  a  trunk<br>
borne bysaid chassis, said trunk including one front<br>
box and one rear box having different sections and<br>
adapted so as to have one slide into the other.<br>
Advantageously, said front box is borne by the front section of said chassis, said rear box being borne by the rear section of said chassis.<br>
Thus, the 'telescopic' structure of the chassis and the trunk borne by the chassis makes it possible to adjust the volume contents of the trailer.<br>
The characteristics and advantages shall appear on a reading of the following description, given by way of<br><br>
example; and with reference to the accompanying drawings on which  :<br>

Here, the chassis 14 rotates freely around an articulation pole 15. This pole 15 is vertical and is borne by said coupler support 12. Said arms are articulated around this pole 15.<br>
In this embodiment, one of said articulated arms 4<br>
bears a spring 16 (figure 1) adapted to be compressed<br>
against a rubber stop 17 borne by the other of said<br>
arms 4 in a clamping position of the strap 9, as shown<br>
on figure 2. Said spring 16 is adapted to stress the<br>
clamp oh spacing during loosening of said strap 9, thus<br>
bringing the clamp from its coupling position as shown<br>
on figure 2 to a freeing position, as shown on figure 1<br>
during loosening of the strap 9.<br>
Figures 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 show a trailer 21 according to a second embodiment of the invention and include means 22 for being secured on the rear wheel 23 of a two wheeler, here a motorcycle.<br>
On  figure 3, said securing means 22 appear arranged  in  the  form  of  a . clamp  including  two<br><br>
articulated arms 24 whose front extremities 25 are shaped to cooperate with the extremities 26 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 23 of the two-wheeler. More specifically, each articulated arm 24 bears at its front extremity 25 an end piece 27 shaped so as to cooperate with an extremity 26 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 23 of the two-wheeler. Said end piece 27 can be dismantled and rotates freely with respect to said articulated arm 24 and has an additional impression of a nut 20 nesting the extremity 26 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 23 of the two-wheeler. The trailer 21 comprises means 28 for clamping said articulated arms 24 borne by the coupler support<br><br>
and adapted to keep the front extremities 25 of said articulated arms 24 in gear with the extremities 26 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of the two-wheeler; as shown on figure 3 where the trailer 21 is coupled to the two-wheeler.<br>
Said trailer 21 comprises at its front portion 29 a coupler support 30 including said securing means 22<br>
and said clamping means 28, and at its rear portion 31<br>
a chassis 32 articulated with respect to said coupler<br>
support 30 and bearing a wheel 57.<br>
Each articulated arm 24 here comprises two side rails 33 and 34, the first side rail 33 constituting the front of the arm 24, the second side rail 34 constituting the rear of said arm 24 in the elongation of said  first side rail 33. Said side rail 33 bears said end piece 27. These two side rails 33 and 34 are rendered integral by two screws. 35.<br>
Said coupler support 30 includes two arm supports<br>
38,	each arm support including an upright 37, the two<br>
uprights 37 of the trailer being intended to take place<br>
on both sides of the rear wheel 23. Each articulated<br>
arm 24 is borne by ' one of the two uprights 37 and is<br>
joined to the latter at an intermediate point 36<br>
situated at the joining point of the two side rails 33<br>
and 34 of the arm 24.<br>
Said coupler support comprises a central portion 39 and two mobile portions 4 0 including said uprights 37 and situated on both sides of this central portion<br>
39 Each mobile portion 40 is constituted by associating the arm support 38, including the upright 37 the securing means 22 and the clamping means 28.<br>
The mobile portions 4 0 are adapted to move along a horizontal guide rod 41 (Fig. 5) borne by said central portion 39. Said central portion 39 further comprises<br><br>
means 42 for adjusting the spacing between said mobile portions 40.<br>
Here, said spacing adjustment means 42 include a threaded adjusting rod 43 borne by said central portion 39 and adapted to cooperate with a female thread 44 fitted in each arm support 38. The adjusting rod 43 is rendered integral in rotation with the central portion 39 during use of the trailer by means of a screw system (not shown).<br>
In the embodiment shown on figure 3, said clamping means 2,3 are constituted by a mechanism for spacing said articulated arms 24 which is borne by the coupler support 30 and cooperating with the rear extremities 45 of the arms 24. They stress said arms 24 on spacing. More specifically, said clamping means 28 comprise two control pams 46 integral with a horizontal transfer pin 47 and respectively coupled in support on the two rear<br>
extremities 45 of the two arms 24. The transfer pin 47<br>
comprise on its external surface two flat surfaces 48<br>
adapted ltd cooperate with two flat surfaces provided on<br>
the contour of an internal orifice 49 of each control<br>
cam 46. The cams 4 6 and the transfer pin 47 are thus integral in rotation. The transfer pin 47" is borne by<br>
the central portion 39 of the coupler support 30 and<br><br>
traverses an orifice 50 fitted in the arm support 38.<br>
Each cam 40 opens at its external extremity 51 via an<br>
orifice 52 fitted in the external flank 53 of the<br>
upright 37.<br>
Said . trailer  21  further  comprises  means  (not shown)  for immobilising said cam 46 on the coupler<br>
support '30. These immobilisation means are placed at<br>
the external extremity 51 of said cam 46. Here, these<br>
immobilisation means include a handle (not shown) borne<br>
by the extremity 51 of the control cam 4 6 and adapted<br><br>
to take! support on the external flank 53 of the upright 37 of the coupler support 30. The immobilisation means<br>
could further include a brake adapted to lock said<br>
handle during use of the trailer 21.<br>
Said coupler support 30 comprises two springs 54<br>
respectively stressing the rear extremities 45 of the<br>
two arms 24 on opening of the clamp. Here each spring<br>
is placed in two cavities  55 and 56 respectively<br>
provided on the internal flank of the upright 37 and on<br>
the rear extremity of the articulated arm 24. In the<br>
cam clamping position shown on figure 3, said spring 54<br>
is  located  between  the  upright  37  and  the  rear<br>
extremity 45 of the arm 24, each rear extremity 45 of<br>
the arm 124 thus being stressed against the cam 46 by<br>
the spring 54.<br>
Figure 4 shows the spring 54 slack in the position<br>
for unclamping the control cam 46. The spring-back of<br>
the spring 54 during unclamping of the cam 4 6 "triggers<br>
opening of the clamp and separation between the front<br>
extremity 25 of the articulated arm 24 and the shaft of<br>
the rear wheel 23 of the vehicle, as shown on figure 4.<br>
The trailer includes a damper system between the<br>
wheel 57 and the chassis 32. A fork 58 connects the<br>
extremity of the rotation shaft of the wheel 57 to the<br>
chassis  32.  This  fork  58  is  equipped  with  an<br>
articulated damper placed below the chassis 32 (figure<br>
5) .<br>
On figure 4, the central portion 39 of the coupler<br>
support 30 bears an articulation pole 59 for said<br>
chassis 32. This vertical pole 59 constitutes a spin<br>
axis for said chassis 32. The front extremity 60 of<br>
said  chassis  32  includes  an  orifice  adapted  to<br>
cooperate with a portion of the articulation pole 59.<br><br>
Two gas dampers 61 are placed on the chassis, each<br>
damper 61 being placed between the chassis and each<br>
mobile portion 40 of said coupler support 30. Said transfer pin 47  constitutes  a horizontal<br>
hinge pin for said chassis 32.  In fact,  the front<br>
extremity 60 of the chassis 32 is in support on the<br>
central  portion 39 of the coupler support 30 which<br>
surrounds one portion of the transfer pin 47,  said<br>
central portion 39 being rotates freely with respect to<br>
said transfer pin 47.<br>
On figure 5, said central portion 39 comprises an<br>
articulated prop  62  including  a  female  thread  73<br>
adapted  to cooperate with a thread 74 provided on a<br>
lower extremity of said articulation pole 59. A roller<br>
wheel  63  covering  the  upper  extremity  of  the<br>
articulation pole 59 is adapted to move in rotation<br>
said articulation pole 59, thus acting on the travel of<br>
the propi 62.<br>
In addition, the trailer 21 comprises a damper 64<br>
between ! an  arm  65  integral  with  the  vertical<br>
articulation pole 59 and an arm 66 integral with said<br>
central portion 39.<br><br>
On figure 5, said chassis 32 includes a girder 67<br>
including a front section and a rear section having<br>
different; segments. The two sections are adapted for<br>
one to slide into the other, thus giving said chassis a<br>
telescopic structure.  Locking  means  68  make  it<br>
possibles to immobilise the two sections with respect to<br>
each other  Said locking means 68 include spindles<br>
mounted on  springs  (not  shown)  forming  pins  for<br>
cooperating with orifices 69 fitted in the flanks of<br>
the girder 67.<br>
On figures 6 and 7, a trunk 70 borne by said<br>
chassis 32 marries at its rear portion the profile of<br><br>
the wheel 57 of the trailer 21. Said trunk 70 includes<br>
a front box 71 and a rear box 72 having different<br>
sections and adapted for one to slide into the other.<br>
Said front box 71 is borne by said front section of<br>
said chjassis 32 and the rear box 72 by said rear<br>
section of said chassis 32. Figure 7 shows the maximum<br>
elongation position of the trunk 70 and the chassis 32.<br>
During  installation  on  a  two-wheeler  of  the<br>
trailer  according to a  first  embodiment of the<br>
invention, the user brings the arms 4 of the trailer 1<br>
opposite the rear wheel 3 of his two-wheeler until the<br>
end piecies 7 cooperate with the extremities 6 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 3 of the vehicle. Then he tightens the strap 9 around the arms and locks it by means of the hook 10. During dismantling of the trailer 1, he merely needs to act again on the hook 10 so as to loosen the strap 9. When slackening, the spring .16 allows opening of the clamp and the arms 4 are then deviated from the rear wheel 3 of the vehicle.<br>
During installation of a trailer 21 on a two-wheeler according to the second embodiment of the invention, the user proceeds in a similar way. Nevertheless, he starts by adjusting the spacing between the mobile portions 40 of the coupler support 30 acting on the adjusting rod 43. In order to do this, he removes the two screws (not shown) linking the rod 43 to the central portion 39, and then with a wrench he rotates the rod 43, the rotation of this threaded rod 43 resulting in the movement in translation of the mobile portions 40 via the threading action of the rod on the female thread of each mobile portion 40. He adjusts the amplitude of the spacing between the mobile portions 40 to the dimensions of the rear wheel 23 of his vehicle. Then he tightens the arms 24 by acting on<br><br>
the means for immobilising the cam 4 6, thus bringing<br>
the end piece 27 of the arm 24 to cooperate with the<br>
extremity 26 of the rotation shaft of the wheel 23.<br>
Previously,  he would have taken care to select an<br>
additional end piece 27  for the extremity of the<br>
rotation shaft of his vehicle. The second arm 24 is<br>
tightened simultaneously with the first arm by virtue<br>
of the transfer of torque carried out by the transfer<br>
spindle 47 enabling the user to activate the two cams<br>
simultaneously. So as to dismantle the trailer 21, it<br>
merely i suffices  for him to act on the means  for<br>
immobilising  the  cams  4 6,  the  springs  54  then<br>
slackening and resulting in spacing the arms 24.<br>
Thus, the trailer of the invention allows fast and simple installation.<br>
	-<br>
Advantageously, the end piece 27 can be dismantled since it is mounted on the front extremity 25 of the arm 24 by screws or even simply nested.<br>
Thus, the user could easily change the end piece 27 depending on the vehicle he wishes to equip with the trailer 21, the trailer being adapted to all types of two-wheelers.<br>
Advantageously, during dismantling of the trailer 21 according to the second embodiment of the invention, the user; could simultaneously act on the roller wheel 63 controlling the prop 62 so as to stabilise the trailer 21 which on stopping rests on this prop 62.<br>
Before installing the trailer 21 on the two-wheeler, the user can advantageously adapt the volume of the trunk 70 to an additional load he wishes to carry. To do this, he merely has to remove the locking means 68 linking the two sections of the chassis 32 and to move the two sections with respect to each other until the desired length of the chassis 32 is obtained.<br><br>
Then he replaces the locking means 68 in the orifices 69 on the flanks of the chassis 32 so as to lock the sections during use of the trailer. He then places the front trunk 71 on the front side rail of the chassis 32 • by means of a fixing system (not shown) and then the rear trunk 72 on the rear section of the chassis 32, the two boxes thus being nested with one inside the other.<br>
Thus, the user is able to vary the volume of his trunk 70 according to' his needs.<br>
During implementation of the trailer according to the second embodiment of the invention, said gas dampers  61 advantageously make it possible to limit amplitude of rotation of the chassis 32 with respect to the coupler support 30 and the effects of the vibration speed of the chassis 32 at high speeds of the two-wheeler,!! known as guiding, are attenuated on account of the presence of these dampers 61. In addition, the presence of the damper 64 advantageously makes it possible to limit the stresses exerted by the trailer 21 on the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 23 of the<br>
vehicle during use of the trailer 21.<br><br>
Figures 8 to 12 show a trailer 71 according to a third embodiment of the invention and including means 72 for securing on the rear wheel 73 of a two-wheeler and involving, as in the . preceding example, a motorcycle.<br>
Said securing means 72 form a clamp including two arms 74 hose front extremities 75 are shaped as in the preceding example, that is provided with the same end pieces 77 as the end pieces 27, so as to cooperate with the extremities 76 (figure 9) of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel 73 of the two-wheeler.<br><br>
The trailer 71 includes means 78 for tightening said arms 74 and adapted to keep the front extremities 75 of said arms geared with the extremities 76 of the rotation shaft of the rear wheel of the two-wheeler, as shown o;n figure 9, the broken lines representing the arms 74 in an opening position.<br>
Said trailer 71 comprises at its front portion a coupler support 80 including said securing means 72 and said tightening means 78, and at its rear portion a chassis  81 articulated with respect to said coupler<br>
support 80 and bearing a wheel 83 by means of a fork 82.<br>
Each arm 74 comprises at its rear extremity or<br>
base extremity a head 84 having a section widened<br>
transversally with respect to its own section and having two neighbouring traversing holes 85 and 86 centred 'transversally.<br>
Said coupler support 8 0 comprises a central portion i87, a rod or bar orientated transversally 88 being integral at its middle. Each portion of said rod or bar is engaged sliding in a hole 85 of the head 84 of the arm 74 on the same side. The central portion 87 bears firstly freely rotating a second rod 89 in which the two similar portions on each side comprise inverted threads and are engaged in the threaded holes 8 6 of the heads 84:<br>
In this example, the opening and tightening of the clamp is thus effected by simply rotating the rod 89, and in addition in a tightening position, a locking is obtained via a clamp effect between the heads 84 and the bar 88, in other words via the slightly slanting position assumed by the heads 84 with respect to the rod 88.<br><br>
Advantageously, so as to reinforce this clamp effect, the heads are split perpendicular to the rods 88 and , 89 so as to form a U whose base is located opposite the clamping head 89 and via elasticity make it possible to close again under • the stress the two legs 84a and 84b with respect to each other, only the portion of the hole 86 in the external leg 84b being threaded, the other portion of the hole 86 in the internal leg 84a being a simple passage.<br>
The chassis 81 of the trailer is formed here of basically a front cage 90 containing a front damper device fixed to a rear cage 91 bearing the joint of the form 82 of the wheel 83 with its damper device.<br>
The' front damper device comprises a ductile parallelogram system 92 including one upper arm 93 and one lower arm 94 connected respectively at their front extremity by a pot type joint link to one upper point and one lower point of the coupler support 80, said points here being situated on said central portion 87. As shown on figure 10, the arms 93 and 94 advantageously have the shape of a form joint, each of the branches of the latter having its articulated extremity on a lateral flange of the cage 90.<br>
The parallelogram 92 defined above can be deformed against a damper 95 (not shown on figure 10) which, is mounted here between firstly the hinge pin of the upper arm 93 in the cage 90, and secondly a spindle borne by the heads with two identical articulated Vs formed on each side by two rocker bars, one having its distal extremity joined onto a transversal spindle borne by the cage 90 and the other having its distal extremity joined at an intermediate point of one of the arms 93 and 94, namely in the example shown, the arm 93.<br><br>
A similar damper device with rocker bars joined at V and a damper 96 is associated with the fork 82 of the wheel 83 in the rear cage 91. Figures 11 and 12 respectively illustrate a stabilised condition and a condition under stress of the two front and rear damper devices of the trailer.<br>
I.<br>
The unit formed by the front cage 90 and the rear cage 91 is provided with firstly means for fixing the trunk of the trailer 97, said means preferably being fast fixing means, such as those diagrammatically shown on figures 8, 11 and 12, enabling said unit to be interchanged. These figures 11 and 12 also show a system for lengthening both two cages 90 and 91 with the aid of an intermediate linking part 98.<br>
Of course, the chassis system described above can be rearranged in the other embodiments of a trailer conforming to the invention and vice versa.<br>
In all the cases, the trailer of the invention advantageously comprises a single wheel. Secondly, it is preferably provided with steering dampers between its chassis and its coupler support.<br>
Thus,  the two-wheeler equipped with a trailer<br>
conforming to the invention retains the aerodynamic<br>
possibilities belonging to two-wheelers.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to<br>
the details of the embodiment described above by way of<br>
