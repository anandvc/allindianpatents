The  following specification  particularly  describes the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new tricyclic triazolic compounds having a great affinity for sigma receptors, especially sigma-1 receptors, as well as to the process for the preparation thereof, to compositions comprising them, and to their use as medicaments.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of these proteins are the sigma (σ) receptors, cell surface receptors of the central nervous system (CNS) which may be related to the dysphoric, hallucinogenic and cardiac stimulant effects of opioids. From studies of the biology and function of sigma receptors, evidence has been presented that sigma receptor ligands may be useful in the treatment of psychosis and movement disorders such as dystonia and tardive dyskinesia, and motor disturbances associated with Huntington's chorea or Tourette's syndrome and in Parkinson's disease ( Walker, J.M. et al, Pharmacological Reviews, 1990, 42, 355 ). It has been reported that the known sigma receptor ligand rimcazole clinically shows effects in the treatment of psychosis (Snyder, S.H., Largent, B.L. J. Neuropsychiatry 1989, 1, 7). The sigma binding sites have preferential affinity for the dextrorotatory isomers of certain opiate benzomorphans, such as (+)SKF 10047, (+)cyclazocine, and (+)pentazocine and also for some narcoleptics such as haloperidol.<br>
“The sigma receptor/s” as used in this application is/are well known and defined using the following citation: This binding site represents a typical protein different from opioid, NMDA, dopaminergic, and other known neurotransmitter or hormone receptor families (G. Ronsisvalle et al. Pure Appl. Chem. 73, 1499-1509 (2001)).<br>
The sigma receptor has at least two subtypes, which may be discriminated by stereoselective isomers of these pharmacoactive drugs. SKF 10047 has nanomolar<br>
2<br><br>
affinity for the sigma 1 (σ-1) site, and has micromolar affinity for the sigma 2 (σ-2) site. Haloperidol has similar affinities for both subtypes.<br>
The Sigma-1 receptor is a non-opiaceous type receptor expressed in numerous adult mammal tissues (e.g. central nervous system, ovary, testicle, placenta, adrenal gland, spleen, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract) as well as in embryo development from its earliest stages, and is apparently involved in a large number of physiological functions. Its high affinity for various pharmaceuticals has been described, such as for SKF-10047, (+)-pentazocine, haloperidol and rimcazole, among others, known ligands with analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressive, antiamnesic, antipsychotic and neuroprotective activity. Sigma-1 receptor is of great interest in pharmacology in view of its possible physiological role in processes related to analgesia, anxiety, addiction, amnesia, depression, schizophrenia, stress, neuroprotection and psychosis [Kaiser et al (1991) Neurotransmissions 7 (1): 1-5], [Walker, J.M. et al, Pharmacological Reviews, 1990, 42, 355] and [Bowen W.D. (2000) Pharmaceutica Acta Helvetiae 74: 211-218].<br>
The Sigma-2 receptor is also expressed in numerous adult mammal tissues (e.g. nervous system, immune system, endocrine system, liver, kidney). Sigma-2 receptors can be components in a new apoptosis route that may play an important role in regulating cell proliferation or in cell development. This route seems to consist of Sigma-2 receptors joined to intracellular membranes, located in organelles storing calcium, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which also have the ability to release calcium from these organelles. The calcium signals can be used in the signaling route for normal cells and/or in induction of apoptosis.<br>
Agonists of Sigma-2 receptors induce changes in cell morphology, apoptosis in several types of cell lines and regulate the expression of p-glycoprotein mRNA, so that they are potentially useful as antineoplasic agents for treatment of cancer. In fact, Sigma-2 receptor agonists have been observed to induce apoptosis in mammary tumour cell lines resistant to common antineoplasic agents that damage DNA. In addition, agonists of Sigma-2 receptors enhance the cytotoxic effects of these antineoplasic agents at concentrations in which the agonist is not cytotoxic.<br>
3<br><br>
Thus, agonists of Sigma-2 receptors can be used as antineoplasic agents at doses inducing apoptosis or at sub-toxic doses in combination with other antineoplasic agents to revert the resistance to the drug, thereby allowing using lower doses of the antineoplasic agent and considerably reducing its adverse effects.<br>
Antagonists of Sigma-2 receptors can prevent the irreversible motor side effects caused by typical neuroleptic agents. In fact, it has been found that antagonists of Sigma-2 receptors can be useful as agents for improving the weakening effects of delayed dyskinesia appearing in patients due to chronic treatment of psychosis with typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol. Sigma-2 receptors also seem to play a role in certain degenerative disorders in which blocking these receptors could be useful.<br>
Endogenous sigma ligands are not known, although progesterone has been suggested to be one of them. Possible sigma-site-mediated drug effects include modulation of glutamate receptor function, neurotransmitter response, neuroprotection, behavior, and cognition (Quirion, R. et al. Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1992, 13:85-86). Most studies have implied that sigma binding sites (receptors) are plasmalemmal elements of the signal transduction cascade. Drugs reported to be selective sigma ligands have been evaluated as antipsychotics (Hanner, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1996, 93:8072-8077). The existence of sigma receptors in the CNS, immune and endocrine systems have suggested a likelihood that it may serve as link between the three systems.<br>
In view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the sigma receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Thus, the prior art discloses different sigma receptor ligands.<br>
For instance, the international patent application WO2007/098961 describes 4,5,6,7 tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene derivatives having pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor.<br>
4<br><br>
Spiro[benzopyran] or spiro[benzofuran] derivatives were also disclosed in EP1847542 as well as pyrazole derivatives (EP1634873) with pharmacological activity on sigma receptors.<br>
Nevertheless, there is still a need to find compounds having pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor, being both effective and selective, and having good "drugability" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.<br>

In general terms enantiomerically pure compounds of general formula (I), can be prepared with a similar synthetic sequence as that already disclosed in methods A to D but starting from enantiomerically pure compound of formula (XII). Compound of formula (XII) can be prepared enantiomerically pure following methods reported in the literature (J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 4197-4199).<br>
The compounds of formula (XII) when treated with a compound of formula (Z) in a solvent such preferably THF, in presence of a base preferably sodium hydride will provide a compound of formula (XIII), which when heated preferably at 100-130ºC in a solvent preferably toluene or xylene will provide a compound of formula (If). Enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (Ib) as defined above could be prepared by removing the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group of compounds of formula (If) by usual conditions as treatment with HCl in a solvent preferably dioxane. From enantiomerically pure compound of formula (Ib), enantiomerically pure compound of formula I may be obtained following methods C and D.<br>
An additional aspect of the invention relates to the therapeutic use of the compounds of general formula (I). As mentioned above, compounds of general<br><br>
formula (I) show a strong affinity to sigma receptors and can behave as agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists, partial antagonists or partial agonists thereofFor this reason, they are suitable for the treatment and the prophylaxis of disorders and diseases mediated by sigma receptors, especially, sigma-1 receptors. In this sense, compounds of formula (I) are very good anxiolitic and immunosuppressant and are very useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of diarrhea, lipoprotein disorders, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, migraine, arthritis, hypertension, arrhythmia, ulcer, glaucoma, learning, memory and attention deficits, cognition disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating diseases, addiction to drugs and chemical substances including cocaine, amphetamine, ethanol and nicotine; tardive diskinesia, ischemic stroke, epilepsy, stroke, stress, cancer, psychotic conditions, in particular depression, anxiety or schizophrenia; inflammation or autoimmune diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are especially suited for the treatment of pain, especially neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain or other pain conditions involving allodynia and/or hyperalgesia. PAIN is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (IASP, Classification of chronic pain, 2nd Edition, IASP Press (2002), 210). Even though pain is always subjective its causes or syndromes can be classified.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, isomer or solvate thereof, and at least a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, additive, adjuvant or vehicle.<br>
The auxiliary materials or additives can be selected among carriers, excipients, support materials, lubricants, fillers, solvents, diluents, colorants, flavor conditioners such as sugars, antioxidants and/or agglutinantsIn the case of suppositories, this may imply waxes or fatty acid esters or preservatives, emulsifiers and/or carriers for parenteral applicationThe selection of these auxiliary materials and/or additives and the amounts to be used will depend on the form of application of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
30<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the invention can be adapted to any form of administration, be it orally or parenterally, for example pulmonarily, nasally, rectally and/or intravenously.Therefore, the formulation in accordance with the invention may be adapted for topical or systemic application, particularly for dermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intraperitoneal, pulmonary, buccal, sublingual, nasal, percutaneous, vaginal, oral or parenteral application.<br>

Rice, 1992, Characterization of the binding of [3H](+)pentazocine to s recognition sites in guinea pig brain, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 227, 371-378) with some modifications. Guinea pig brains were homogenized in 10 vols. (w/v) of Tris-HCl 50 mM 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.4, with a Kinematica Polytron PT 3000 at 15000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 4ºC and the supernatants collected and centrifuged again at 48000g for 15 min at 4ºC. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), incubated at 37ºC for 30 min, and centrifuged at 48000g for 20 min at 4ºC. Following this, the pellet was re-suspended in fresh Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and stored on ice until use.<br>
The radioligand used was [3H]-(+)-pentazocine at 5.0 nM and the final volume was 200 µl. The incubation was initiated with the addition of 100 µl of membrane at a final tissue concentration of approximately 5 mg tissue net weight/mL and the incubation time was 150 m. at 37 ºC. After incubation, the membranes were collected onto pretreated glass fiber filterplate (MultiScreen-FC, Millipore), with polyethylenimine 0.1 %. The filters were washed two times with 200 µl of washing buffer (50 mM Tris Cl, pH = 7.4) and then 25 µl of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail were added. Microplates were allowed to set for several hours and then quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (1450 Microbeta, Wallac). Nonspecific binding was determined with 1 µM haloperidol.<br><br>
