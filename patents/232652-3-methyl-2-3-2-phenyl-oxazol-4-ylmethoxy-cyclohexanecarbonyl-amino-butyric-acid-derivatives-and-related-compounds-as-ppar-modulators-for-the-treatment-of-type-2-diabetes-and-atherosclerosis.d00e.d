Aryl means an aromatic carbocyclic mono- or bicyclic ring system which<br><br>
comprises 6 to 10 atoms in the ring or rings.<br>
Heteroaryl is a mono- or tricyclic aromatic ring system having 4 to 11 ring members, in which at least one atom in the ring system is a heteroatom from the series N, O and S.<br>
The compounds of the formula I comprise at least two centers of asymmetry and may comprise more in addition. The compounds of the formula I may therefore exist in the form of their racemates, racemic mixtures, pure enantiomers, diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. The present invention encompasses all these isomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. These isomeric forms can be obtained by known methods even if not specifically described in some cases.<br>
Pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are, because their solubility in water is greater than that of the initial or basic compounds, particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutical^ acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts), and salts of trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanedioI), diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound<br><br>
of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
Use<br>
This invention relates further to the use of compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR ligands. The PPAR ligands of the invention are suitable as modulators of PPAR activity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors which can be activated by ligands and belong to the class of nuclear hormone receptors. There are three PPAR isoforms, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta, which are encoded by different genes (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR): structure, mechanisms of activation and diverse functions: Motojima K, Cell Struct Funct. 1993 Oct; 18(5): 267-77).<br>
Two variants of PPARgamma exist, PPARgammai and gamma2, which are the result of alternative use of promoters and differential mRNA splicing (Vidal-Puig et al. J. Clin. Invest, 97:2553-2561,1996). Different PPARs have different tissue distribution and modulate different physiological functions. The PPARs play a key role in various aspects of the regulation of a large number of genes, the products of which genes are directly or indirectly crucially involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, for example, PPARalpha receptors play an important part in the regulation of fatty acid catabolism or lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, while<br><br>
PPARgamma is crucially involved for example in regulating adipose cell differentiation. In addition, however, PPARs are also involved in the regulation of many other physiological processes, including those which are not directly connected with carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. The activity of different PPARs can be modulated by various fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives and synthetic compounds to varying extents. For relevant reviews about functions, physiological effect and pathophysiology, see: Joel Berger et al., Annu. Rev. Med. 2002, 53, 409 - 435; Timothy Wilson et al. J. Med. Chern., 2000, Vol. 43, No. 4, 527-550; Steven Kliewer et al., Recent Prog Horm Res. 2001; 56: 239-63.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I suitable for modulating the activity of PPARs, especially the activity of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Depending on the modulation profile, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the treatment, control and prophylaxis of the indications described hereinafter, and for a number of other pharmaceutical applications connected thereto (see, for example, Joel Berger et al., Annu. Rev. Med. 2002, 53, 409 - 435; Timothy Wilson et al. J. Med. Chem., 2000, Vol. 43, No. 4, 527-550; Steven Kliewer et al., Recent Prog Horm Res. 2001; 56: 239-63; Jean-Charles Fruchart, Bart Staels and Patrick Duriez: PPARS, Metabolic Disease and Arteriosclerosis, Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, No. 5, 2001; Sander Kersten, Beatrice Desvergne &amp; Walter Wahli: Roles of PPARs in health and disease, NATURE, VOL 405, 25 MAY 2000; Ines Pineda Torra, Giulia Chinetti, Caroline Duval, Jean-Charles Fruchart and Bart Staels: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: from transcriptional control to clinical practice, Curr Opin Lipidol 12:2001,245-254).<br>

Formulations<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.001 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.01 mg to 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.001 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 0.05 to 1000 mg, typically from 0.5 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each<br><br>
individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules, as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound, which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>

Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARalpha assay<br>
Principle<br>
The potency of substances which bind to human PPARa and activate in an agonistic manner is analyzed using a stably transfected HEK cell line (HEK= human embryo kidney) which is referred to here as PPARalpha reporter cell line. It contains two genetic elements, a luciferase reporter element (pdeltaM»GAL4-Luc-Zeo) and a PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARa-LBD) which mediates expression of the luciferase reporter element depending on a PPARalpha ligand. The stably and constitutively expressed fusion protein GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD binds in the cell nucleus of the PPARalpha reporter cell line via the GAL4 protein portion to the GAL4 DNA binding motifs 5'-upstream of the luciferase reporter element which is integrated in the genome of the cell line. There is only little expression of the luciferase reporter gene without addition of a PPARalpha ligand if fatty acid-depleted fetal calf serum (cs-FCS) is used in the assay. PPARa ligands bind and activate the PPARa fusion protein and thereby bring about expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase which is formed can be detected by means of chemi-luminescence via an appropriate substrate.<br><br>
Construction of the cell line<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cell line was prepared in 2 stages. Firstly, the luciferase reporter element was constructed and stably transfected into HEK cells. For this purpose, five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (each 5'-CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG-3') were cloned in 5'-upstream of a 68 bp-long minimal MMTV promoter (Genbank Accession # V01175). The minimal MMTV promoter section contains a CCAAT box and a TATA element in order to enable efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II. The cloning and sequencing of the GAL4-MMTV construct took place in analogy to the description of Sambrook J. et a/. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Then the complete Photinus pyralis gene (Genbank Accession # M15077) was cloned in 3'-downstream of the GAL4-MMTV element. After sequencing, the luceriferase reporter element consisting of five GAL4 binding sites, MMTV promoter and luciferase gene was recloned into a plasmid which confers zeocin resistance in order to obtain the plasmid pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo. This vector was transfected into HEK cells in accordance with the statements in Ausubel, F.M. et al. (Current protocols in molecular biology, Vol. 1-3, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995). Then zeocin-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml) was used to select a suitable stable cell clone which showed very low basal expression of the luceriferase gene. In a second step, the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) was introduced into the stable cell clone described. For this purpose, initially the cDNA coding for the N-terminal 76 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor (Genbank Accession # P04150) was linked to the cDNA section coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Genbank Accession # P04386). The cDNA of the ligand-binding domain of the human PPARalpha receptor (amino acids S167-Y468; Genbank Accession # S74349) was cloned in at the 3'-end of this GR-GAL4 construct. The fusion construct prepared in this way (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) was recloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) in order to enable constitutive expression therein by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease and stably transfected into the previously described cell clone containing the luciferase reporter element. The finished PPARalpha reporter cell line which contains a luciferase reporter element and constitutively expresses the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-human PPARalpha-LBD) was isolated by selection with zeocin<br><br>
(0.5 mg/ml) and G418 (0.5 mg/ml).<br>
Assay procedure<br>
The activity of PPARalpha agonists is determined in a 3-day assay which is described below:<br>
Day 1<br>
The PPARa reporter cell line is cultivated to 80% confluence in DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with the following additions: 10% cs-FCS (fetal calf serum; #SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 0.5 mg/ml zeocin (#R250-01, Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml G418 (#10131-027, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). The cultivation takes place in standard cell culture bottles (# 353112, Becton Dickinson) in a cell culture incubator at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. The 80%-confluent cells are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen), treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min, taken up in 5 ml of the DMEM described and counted in a cell counter. After dilution to 500.000 cells/ml, 35,000 cells are seeded in each well of a 96 well microtiter plate with a clear plastic base (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in the cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.<br>
Day 2<br>
PPARalpha agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO in a concentration<br>
of 10 mM. This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen)<br>
which is mixed with 5% cs-FCS (#SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 2 mM<br>
L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen) and the previously described<br>
antibiotics (zeocin, G418, penicillin and streptomycin).<br>
Test substances are tested in 11 different concentrations in the range from<br>
10 pM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration<br>
ranges from 1 pM to 10 pM or between 100 nM and 1 pM.<br>
The medium of the PPARalpha reporter cell line seeded on day 1 is<br>
completely removed by aspiration, and the test substances diluted in<br>
medium are immediately added to the cells. The dilution and addition of the<br>
substances is carried out by a robot (Beckman FX). The final volume of the<br>
test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96 well microtiter<br>
plate. The DMSO concentration in the assay is less than 0.1 % v/v in order<br><br>
to avoid cytotoxic effects of the solvent.<br>
Each plate was charged with a standard PPARalpha agonist, which was likewise diluted in 11 different concentrations, in order to demonstrate the functioning of the assay in each individual plate. The assay plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 24 h.<br>
Day 3<br>
The PPARa reporter cells treated with the test substances are removed from the incubator, and the medium is aspirated off. The cells are lyzed by pipetting 50 pi of Bright Glo reagent (from Promega) into each well of a 96 well microtiter plate. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the microtiter plates are measured in the luminometer (Trilux from Wallac). The measuring time for each well of a microtiter plate is 1 sec.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The raw data from the luminometer are transferred into a Microsoft Excel file. Dose-effect plots and EC50 values of PPAR agonists are calculated using the XLFit program as specified by the manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
The PPARalpha EC50 values for the compounds of Examples 1 to 50 in this assay are in the range from 1 nM to &gt;10 pM.<br>
The results for the activity of some compounds of the invention of the formula I are indicated in Table I below:<br><br><br>
It is evident from Table I that the compounds of the invention of the formula I activate the PPARalpha receptor and thus bring about for example in analogy to fibrates in clinical use a lowering of triglycerides in the body (see, for example, J.-Ch. Fruchard et al.: PPARS, Metabolic Disease and Atherosclerosis, Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, No. 5, 2001; S. Kersten et al.: Roles of PPARs in health and disease, NATURE, VOL 405, 25 MAY 2000; I. Pineda et al.: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: from transcriptional control to clinical practice, Curr Opin Lipidol 12: 2001, 245-254).<br>
Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARgamma assay<br>
Principle<br>
A transient transfection system is employed to determine the cellular PPARgamma activity of PPAR agonists. It is based on the use of a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK) and of a PPARgamma expression plasmid (pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD). Both plasmids are transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK cells). There is then expression in these cells of the fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD which binds to the GAL4 binding sites of the reporter plasmid. In the presence of a PPARgamma-active ligand, the activated fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD induces expression<br><br>
of the luciferase reporter gene, which can be detected in the form of a chemiluminescence signal after addition of a luciferase substrate. As a difference from the stably transfected PPARalpha reporter cell line, in the cellular PPARy assay the two components (luciferase reporter plasmid and PPARgamma expression plasmid) are transiently transfected into HEK cells because stable and permanent expression of the PPARgamma fusion protein is cytotoxic.<br>
Construction of the plasmids<br>
The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK is based on the vector pGL3basic from Promega. The reporter plasmid is prepared by cloning five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (each binding site with the sequence 5'-CTCGGAGGACAGTACTCCG-3'), together with a 160 bp-Iong thymidine kinase promoter section (Genbank Accession # AF027128) 5'-upstream into pGL3basic. 3'-downstream of the thymidine kinase promoter is the complete luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis (Genbank Accession # M15077) which is already a constituent of the.plasmid pGL3basic used. The cloning and sequencing of the reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et ai (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).<br>
The PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARyLBD was prepared by first cloning the cDNA coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Genbank Accession # P04386) into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) 3'-downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Subsequently, the cDNA of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the human PPARy receptor (amino acids I152-Y475; Accession # g1480099) 3'-downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Cloning and sequencing of the PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3~GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD again took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et a/. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Besides the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK and the PPARy expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD, also used for the cellular PPARgamma assay are the reference plasmid pRL-CMV (from Promega) and the plasmid pBluescript SK(+) from Stratagene. All four plasmids were prepared using a plasmid preparation kit from Qiagen, which ensured a plasmid quality with<br><br>
a minimal endotoxin content, before transfection into HEK cells.<br>
Assay procedure<br>
The activity of PPARgamma agonists is determined in a 4-day assay which is described below. Before the transfection, HEK cells are cultivated in DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with the following additions: 10% FCS (#16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen).<br>
Day 1<br>
Firstly, solution A, a transfection mixture which contains all four plasmids previously described in addition to DMEM, is prepared. The following amounts are used to make up 3 ml of solution A for each 96 well microtiter plate for an assay: 2622 pi of antibiotic- and serum-free DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen), 100 pi of reference plasmid pRL-CMV (1 ng/pl), 100 pi of luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK (10 ng/pl), 100 pi of PPARy expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARvLBD (100 ng/pl) and 78 pi of plasmid pBluescript SK(+) (500 ng/pl). Then 2 ml of solution B are prepared by mixing 1.9 ml of DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) with 100 pi of PolyFect transfection reagent (from Qiagen) for each 96 well microtiter plate. Subsequently, 3 ml of solution A are mixed with 2 ml of solution B to give 5 ml of solution C, which is thoroughly mixed by multiple pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 80%-confluent HEK cells from a cell culture bottle with a capacity of 175 cm2 are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen) and treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min. The cells are then taken up in 15 ml of DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 10% FCS (# 16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). After the cell suspension has been counted in a cell counter, the suspension is diluted to 250,000 cells/ml. 15 ml of this cell suspension are mixed with 5 ml of solution C for one microtiter plate. 200 pi of the suspension are seeded in each well of a 96 well microtiter plate with a clear plastic base (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 24 h.<br><br>
Day 2<br>
PPAR agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 mM. This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 2% Ultroser (#12039-012, Biosepra), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). Test substances are tested in a total of 11 different concentrations in the range from 10 pM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges from 1 pM to 10 pM. The medium of the HEK cells transfected and seeded on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and the test substances diluted in medium are immediately added to the cells. The dilution and addition of the substances is carried out by a robot (Beckman FX). The final volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96 well microtiter plate. Each plate is charged with a standard PPARy agonist, which is likewise diluted in 11 different concentrations, in order to demonstrate the functioning of the assay in each individual plate. The assay plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 48h.<br>
Day 4<br>
After removal of the medium by aspiration, 50 pi of Dual-Glo™ reagent (Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) are added to each well in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in order to lyze the cells and provide the substrate for the firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis) formed in the cells. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the firefly luciferase-mediated chemiluminescence is measured in a measuring instrument (measuring time/well 1 sec; Trilux from Wallac). Then 50 pi of the Dual-Glo™ Stop &amp; Glo reagent (Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) is added to each well in order to stop the activity of the firefly luciferase and provide the substrate for the Renilla luciferase expressed by the reference plasmid pRL-CMV. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for a further 10 minutes, a chemiluminescence mediated by the Renilla luciferase is again measured for 1 sec/well in the measuring instrument.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The crude data from the luminometer are transferred into a Microsoft Excel<br><br>
file. The firefly/Renilla luciferase activity ratio is determined for each measurement derived from one well of the microtiter plate. The dose-effect plots and EC50 values of PPAR agonists are calculated from the ratios by the XL.Fit program as specified by the manufacturer (IDBS). PPARgamma EC50 values in the range from 1 nM to &gt;10 uM were measured for the PPAR agonists described in this application.<br>

Ring A = cis-cyclohexan-1,3-diyl, with the stereochemistry according to<br>

Processes<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can be obtained according to the reaction schemes below:<br><br>
At room temperature, compound A-1 is stirred with sodium methoxide in methanol. After work-up, the product is protected at the hydroxyl group (SG = protective group), for example by reaction with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride and imidazole in dimethylformamide at room temperature or with methoxymethyl chloride, ethyldiisopropylamine in dichloromethane. This gives compound A-2.<br>
Compound A-2 is stirred with sodium hydroxide in isopropanol at 60°C for 1 hour and worked up. The carboxylic acid obtained in this manner is, in dimethylformamide, reacted with the tert-butyl ester of an a-amino acid of the formula A-3 in which R6 and R7 are as defined above, hydroxybenzo-triazole, diisopropylethylamine and 0-[cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene-amino]-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) to give the product of the formula A-4 in which R9 = H. In some examples, the coupling product is reacted with sodium hydride and an alkyl iodide of the<br><br>
formula R9-I where R9 is as defined above, except for R9 = H, to give the compound of the formula A-4.<br>
Compound A-4 is then O-deprotected to give compound A-5 using, for example, tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran in the case of the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl protective group or using concentrated hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran in the case of the methoxymethyl protective group. The compound of the formula A-5 is, in dimethylformamide, reacted with sodium hydride and the compound of the formula A-6 in which R1, R2, R3 and W are as defined above. The product is stirred in trifluoroacetic acid for a number of hours and the diastereomers are then, if required, separated by preparative HPLC. This gives the compound of the formula A-7. According to this process, it is possible to synthesize examples 1 to 40.<br><br>
At 0°C, the compounds B-1 and an amino acid of the formula A-3 in which R6, R7 and R9 are as defined above are initially charged in dimethyl formamide, and triethylamine and catalytic amounts of dimethylamino-<br><br>
pyridine are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature. After workup, the product of the formula B-2 is reduced, for example by reaction with isobutyl chloroformate and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran followed by addition of sodium borohydride to give the compound of the formula B-3 in which R6, R7 and R9 are as defined above. Compound B-3 is converted with potassium tert-butoxide and an alkyl iodide of the formula A-6 in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above into the compound of the formula B-4 in which R1, R2, R3, R6, R7 and R9 are as defined above. Compound B-4 is then deprotected, for example by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, to give the compound of the formula B-5 in which R1, R2, R3, R6, R7 and R9 are as defined above. According to this process, it is possible to synthesize examples 41 to 50.<br>
Process C:<br><br>
Ester C-1, in which R3 is as defined above, is converted with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid into oxime C-2, which is reduced by hydrogenation with hydrogen over palladium/carbon to amine C-3.<br>
The compound C-3 is reacted with acid chlorides of the general formula C-4, in which R1, W and R2 are as defined above, and base (for example triethylamine), to give compound C-5.<br><br>
Compound C-5 is, by heating in phosphoryl chloride, converted into compound C-6, in which R1, R2, W and R3 are as defined above.<br>
Ester C-6 is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in an ethereal solvent (e.g. diethyl ether) to alcohol C-7. This is converted (for example with iodine, imidazole (ImH) and triphenylphosphine) into iodide A-6.<br>
Process D:<br>
This process serves for the synthesis of building block A-6, where R1, R2, W and R3 are as defined above.<br><br>
Compound D-1, in which R3 is as defined above, is reacted with aldehyde D-2, where R1, R2 and W are as defined above, in ethanol with hydrogen chloride, to give compound D-3.<br>
Compound D-3 is, in phosphoryl chloride, heated at the boil, giving compound D-4. This is heated at the boil with sodium iodide in acetone. This gives compound A-6.<br>
Other compounds can be prepared according to the processes mentioned above.<br><br><br>

36.8 g of (1R,3S)/(1S,3R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilanyloxy)cyclohexane-carboxylic acid are dissolved in 150 ml of isopropanol, and 8 g of NaOH, dissolved in 50 ml of water, are added. The mixture is heated at 60°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is cooled and neutralized by addition of 2N HCI. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted three times with in each case 200 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over MgS04, and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure. This gives 34 g of the free acid as a colorless oil (Rf(ethyl acetate) = 0.63). This is dissolved in 250 ml of dimethylformamide, and 18.6 g of tert-butyl L-valine hydrochloride are added. At 0°C, 29.1 g of 0-[cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methyleneamino]-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate are added. After 10 minutes, the ice bath is removed, and 23.9 g of hydroxybenzotriazole and 61.8 ml of<br><br>
Hunigs base are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed three times with saturated NaHC03 solution. The organic phase is dried over MgS04, and the solvent is then removed. The residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate = 2:1. This gives 43.0 g of tert-butyl 2-{[(1R,3S)/(1S,3R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilanyloxy)cyclohexanecarbonyl]-amino}-(3S)-methyIbutyrate as a yellow oil. C32H47N04Si (537.82), MS(ESI): 538.<br><br>
43.0 g of tert-butyl 2-{[(1R,3S)/(1S,3R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilanyloxy)-cyclohexanecarbonyl]amino)-(3S)-methylbutyrate are dissolved in 80 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and 80 ml of a 1M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran are added. The mixture is stirred at 60°C for 3 h and then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate = 5:1 =&gt; 1:1. This gives 18 g of a white solid. Since this is still slightly impure, 8 g are subjected to another purification on silica gel. This gives 6.8 g of tert-butyl 2-[((1Rl3S)/(1S,3R)-3-hydroxycyclohexanecarbonyl)amino]-3S)-methyl-butyrate as a white solid. C16H29N04 (299.41), MS(ESI): 300 (M+H+).<br><br>
4.0 g of tert-butyl 2-[((1R,3S)/(1S,3R)-3-hydroxycyclohexanecarbonyl)-amino]-(3S)-methylbutyrate and 6.3 g of 4-iodomethyI-5-methyl-2-p-tolyloxazole are dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylformamide, and 800 mg of sodium hydride (60% strength in paraffin oil) are added a little at a time.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and then diluted by addition of 200 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether and washed three times with water. The combined organic phases are dried over MgS04, and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue is dissolved in 40 ml of dichloromethane, and 20 ml of trifluoro-acetic acid are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 hours, 100 ml of toluene are then added, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure. The residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate = 2:1 =&gt; ethyl acetate. This gives 1.5 g of a brown solid. This is purified further by RP-HPLC. This gives 1.0 g of the diastereomer mixture (S)-3-methyl-2-{[(1R,3S)/(1S,3R)-3-(5-methyl-2-p-tolyloxazol-4-ylmethoxy)cyclohexanecarbonyl]amino)butyricacid (Example 1) as a colorless amorphous solid.
