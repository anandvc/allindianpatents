				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment<br>
and/or the prevention of neurona! degeneration or other diseases related to<br>
high levels of expression or activity of P2X7 receptors (P2RX7), In preferred<br>
embodiments, the invention relates to the use of RNAi technology to<br>
downregulate the expression of P2RX7.<br>
Methods and compositions are provided for the treatment of diseases related to<br>
high levels of P2RX7, which include, but are not limited to, neuronal<br>
degeneration, reperfusion or ischemia in stroke or heart attack, Alzheimer's<br>
disease, inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
asthma, rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory<br>
bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease), allergies, autoimmune diseases,<br>
cancer (such as leukaemia or non-melanoma skin cancer), skin-related<br>
conditions (such as psoriasis, eczema, alopecia), retinal diseases and treatment<br>
of pain of neuropathic and inflammatory origin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
RNAi-as a tool to downregulate gene expression<br>
Gene targeting by homologous recombination is commonly used to determine<br>
gene function in mammals, but this is a costly and time-consuming process.<br>
Alternatively, the functions of many genes can be determined after mRNA<br>
inhibition with ribozyme or antisense technologies. Although successful in some<br>
situations these technologies have been difficult to apply universally. The<br>
advent of siRNA-directed "knockdown" has sparked a revolution in somatic eel!<br>
genetics, allowing the inexpensive and rapid analysis of gene function in<br>
mammals.<br>
Establishing a convenient and reliable method to knock-out gene expression at<br>
the mRNA level has been a recurrent therne in molecular biology over the last<br>
15 years. In efforts to generate loss-of function cells or organisms, various<br>
molecules that included, for example, antlsense sequences, rlbozymes, and<br>
chimeric oligonudeotides have been tested, but the design of such molecules<br>
was based on trial and error, depending on the properties of the target gene.<br>
Moreover, the desired effects were difficult to predict, and often only weak<br>
suppression achieved (Braasch &amp; Corey, 2002).<br>
After the discovery of the phenomenon in plants in the early 1990s, in 1998<br>
Andy Rre and Craig MeHo for the first time demonstrated with the worm<br>
Caenorhabcfitis efegantsthat dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) may specifically and<br>
selectively Inhibit gene expression in an extremely efficient manner (Rre et a/.,<br>
1998). In their experiment; the sequence of the first strand (the so-called sense<br>
RNA) coincides with that of the corresponding region of the target messenger<br>
RNA (mRNA). The second strand (antisense RNA) Is complementary to this<br>
mRNA. The resulting dsRNA turned out to be far more (several orders of<br>
magnitude) efficient than the corresponding single-stranded RNA molecules (in<br>
particular, antlsense RNA). Rre et a/., 1998 named the phenomenon RNAi for<br>
RNA interference. This powerful gene silencing mechanism has been shown to<br>
operate in several species among most phylogenetic phyla.<br>
RNAi begins when an enzyme named DICER encounters dsRNA and chops it<br>
Into pieces called small-interfering RNAs or siRNAs. This protein belongs to the<br>
RNase HI nuclease family. A complex of proteins gathers up these RNA remains<br>
and uses their code as a guide to search out and destroy any RNAs in the cell<br>
with a matching sequence, such as target mRNA (for review see Bosher &amp;<br>
Labouesse, 2000).<br>
The RNAi phenomenon (Akashi etal., 2001) might be summarized as follows:<br>
• Step 1: dsRNA recognition and scanning process.<br>
• Step 2: dsRNA cleavage through RNase III activity and production of siRNAs.<br>
• Step 3: association of the siRNAs and associated factors in RISC complexes,<br>
• Step 4: recognition of the complementary target mRNA.<br>
• Step B: cleavage of the target mRNA in the centre of the region<br>
complementary to the siRNA.<br>
• Step 6: degradation of the target mRNA and recycling of the RISC complex.<br>
In trying to apply the RNAi phenomenon as a technology for gene knockdown,<br>
it was soon realized that mammalian cells have developed various protective<br>
phenomena against viral infections that could impede the use of this approach.<br>
Indeed, the presence of extremely low levels of viral dsRNA triggers an<br>
tofcerferon response, resulting in a global non-specific suppression of translation,<br>
which In turn triggers apoptosis (Williams, 1997, Gil &amp; Esteban, 2000).<br>
In 2000, a first attempt with dsRNA resulted In the specific Inhibition of 3 genes<br>
(MmGFP under the control of the Elongation Factor la, E-cadherin, and c-mos)<br>
in the mouse oocyte and early embryo. Translational arrest, and thus a PKR<br>
response, was not observed as the embryos continued to develop (Wianny &amp;<br>
Zernicka-Goetz, 2000). One year later, research at Ribopharma AG (Kulmbach,<br>
Germany) first demonstrated the functionality of RNAi in mammalian cells.<br>
Using short (20-24 base pairs) dsRNAs - which are called SIRPLEX™- they<br>
specifically switched off genes even in human cells without initiating the acutephase<br>
response. Similar experiments carried out later by other research groups<br>
(Elbashlr etal., 2001; Caplen eta/., 2001) further confirmed these results.<br>
A year later, Paddison et al. (Paddison et al, 2002) tried to use small RNAs<br>
folded in hairpin structures to inhibit the function of specific genes. This work<br>
was inspired by previous studies showing that some genes in Caenorhabditis<br>
elegans naturally regulate other genes through RNAi by coding for hairpinstructured<br>
RNAs. Tested in a variety of normal and cancer human and mouse<br>
cell lines, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are able to silence genes as efficiently as<br>
their siRNA counterparts. Moreover, shRNAs exhibit better reassociation kinetics<br>
in vivo than equivalent duplexes. Even more important, these authors<br>
generated transgenic cell lines engineered to synthesize shRNAs that exhibit a<br>
long-lasting suppressing effect throughout cell divisions (Eurogentec). Recently,<br>
another group of small RNAs (also comprised in the range of 21-25 nt) was<br>
shown to mediate downreguiation of gene expression. These RNAs, known as<br>
small temporally regulated RNAs (stRNAs), have been described in<br>
Caenorhabditis eSegans were they regulate timing of gene expression during<br>
development. It should be noted that stRNAs and siRNAs, despite obvious<br>
similarities, proceed through different modes of action (for review see Banerjee<br>
&amp; Slack, 2002, In contrast with siRNAs, 22 nt long stRNAs downreguiate<br>
expression of target mRNA after transtational initiation without affecting mRNA<br>
integrity. Recent studies Indicate that the two stRNAs first described in<br>
nematodes are the members of a huge family with hundreds of additional<br>
micro-RNAs (miRNAs) existing in metazoarts (Grosshans &amp; Sack, 2002).<br>
Scientists have initially used RNA1 in several systems, including Caenorhabditis<br>
elegans, Drosophila, trypanosomes, and various other invertebrates. Moreover,<br>
using this approach, several groups have recently presented the specific<br>
suppression of protein biosynthesis in different mammalian cell lines -<br>
specifically in HeLa cells - showing that RNAI Is a broadly applicable method for<br>
gene silencing in vitro. Based on these results, RNAi has rapidly become a well<br>
recognized tool for validating (identifying and assigning) gene functions. RNA<br>
interference employing short dsRNA oligonucleotides will, moreover, permit to<br>
decipher the function of genes being only partially sequenced. RNAi will<br>
therefore become inevitable in studies such as:<br>
• Inhibition of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotic<br>
cells, In this context, RNAi is a straight-forward tool to rapidly assess gene<br>
function and reveal null phenotypes.<br>
• Development of the RNAi technology for use in post-implantation embryos.<br>
• The predominant economic significance of RNA interference is established by<br>
its application as a therapeutic principle. As so, RNAi may yield RNA-based<br>
drugs to treat human diseases.<br>
Inhibition of high levels of P2RX7 to prevent disease.<br>
P2X receptors are membrane ion channels that open in response to the binding<br>
of extracellular ATP (North, 2002). They are abundantly distributed, and<br>
functional responses are seen in neurons, glia, epithelia, endothelia, bone,<br>
muscle, and haematopoietic tissues.<br>
The purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2RX7) are ligand-gated cation channels with a<br>
wide distribution that includes cells of the immune and haematopoietic system<br>
(Di Virgllio et al., 2001; North 2002). Two splice forms of P2RX7 corresponding<br>
to GenBank Accession Numbers NMJ302562 and NM_177427 were initially<br>
identified. However, identification of seven variants of human P2RX7 which<br>
result from alternative splicing has recently been reported (Cheewatrakoolpong<br>
et al., 2005).<br>
Activation of P2RX7 by brief exposure to extracellular ATP opens a channel that<br>
allows Ca2"1" and Na+ influx and K+ efflux and that initiates a cascade of<br>
intracellular downstream events. These include the stimulation of phospholipase<br>
D (EI-Moatassim &amp; Dubyak, 1993; Gargett et al, 1996), the activation of<br>
membrane metalloproteases (Jamieson, et al., 1996; Gu et al, 1998; Sluyter &amp;<br>
Wiley, 2002), and the stimulation of intracellular caspases, which eventually<br>
lead to the apoptotic death of the target cell (Ferrari et at, 1999; Humphreys et<br>
al, 2000). P2RX7 activation also leads to extensive membrane blebbing (Virginio<br>
et al., 1999), which is a typical morphological feature of the apoptotic process.<br>
P2RX7 mediates fast excitatory transmission in diverse regions of the brain and<br>
spinal cord (North, 2002). ATP has recently been identified as a potent<br>
transmitter of astrocytic calcium signalling (Cotrina et al., 1998; Guthrie et al,<br>
1999). Astrocytic calcium signalling seems to be a general mechanism by which<br>
astrocytes respond to a variety of stimuli including synaptic activity, transmitter<br>
exposure and traumatic injury (Fields &amp; Stevens-Graham, 2002). By this means,<br>
local astrocytes transmit calcium signals to neurons within their own<br>
geographical mlcrodomaln. This ATP-dependent process of calcium wave<br>
propagation occurs in the brain as well as in the parenchyma of the spinal cord<br>
(Scemes et al.7 2000, Fam et al., 2000), where it may have a role in extending<br>
local injury.<br>
Preliminary observations Indicate that traumatic injury triggers both AT? release<br>
and calcium signalling (Cook &amp; McCleskey, 2002; Neary et al., 2003, Du et al.,<br>
1999). The feet that P2RX7 Is expressed in spinal cord neurons, including motor<br>
neurons (Deuchars et al., 2001), and that P2RX7 is an ATP-gated cation<br>
channel whose activation directly mediates cell death (Di vlrgllio et a/., 1998),<br>
target P2RX7 as good candidates to be inhibited for the prevention of traumatic<br>
injury consequences as well as of chronic trauma. Delivery of P2RX7<br>
antagonists OxATP or PPADS to rats after acute impact injury significantly<br>
improved functional recovery and diminished cell death in the peritraumatic<br>
zone, reducing both the histological extent and functional sequelae of acute<br>
spinal cord injury (Wang et al., 2004).<br>
A postischemic, time-dependent upregulation of the P2X7 receptor-subtype on<br>
neurons and glial cells has also been demonstrated, and suggests a role for this<br>
receptor in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia in vivo (Franke et al.,<br>
2004).<br>
Parvathenani et al have shown a remarkable difference in the staining pattern<br>
for P2RX7 in brain slices of a transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)<br>
(Parvathenani et al, 2003). The intense staining for P2RX7 around plaques can<br>
be the result of up-regulation of the P2X7 receptor and/or aggregation of glia<br>
around plaques. The striking association in vivo between P2X7 receptor-positive<br>
cells and plaques in a transgenic mouse model of AD suggests that antagonists<br>
of P2RX7 could have therapeutic utility in treatment of AD by regulating<br>
pathologically activated microglia.<br>
Extracellular ATP has proven to activate multiple downstream signalling events<br>
in a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line (Budagian et al.; 2003). Both P2RX7<br>
rnRNA and protein have been detected in eight of eleven human<br>
haematopoietic cell lines in a non-lineage-specific manner (Zhang et al., 2004).<br>
Further, bone marrow mononuclear cell samples from 69 leukaemia and 9<br>
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (out of 87 and 10 patients,<br>
respectively) were P2RX7 positive at mRNA level. Moreover, both positive rates<br>
and relative expression levels were significantly higher in acute myelogenous<br>
leukaemia (AML), acute tyrnpnobtastk: leukaemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous<br>
leukaemia (CML), and MDS groups than in the normal donor group. After one<br>
course of standard Induction therapies, the remission rate in high P2RX7<br>
expression group was tower than that in either the P2RX7 negative group or the<br>
low P2RX7 expression group (Zhang et al., 2004). Expression and function of<br>
P2RX7 have also been associated with the clinical course of patients affected by<br>
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (Cabrini et al., 2005).<br>
Dendritic cells (DC), which are central in the initiation of adaptive immune<br>
responses (Hart, 1997; Stockwln et al., 2000) express P2RX7 (Mutini et al.,<br>
1999; Berchtold et al., 1999; Ferrari et al., 2000). Further, it has been<br>
demonstrated that activation of P2RX7 in DC opens a cation-selective channel<br>
and leads to rapid and near complete shedding of CD23, the low affinity<br>
receptor for IgE (Sluyter &amp; Wiley, 2002), which has an emerging role in chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases Including rheumatoid arthritis (Bonnefy, 1996).<br>
Electrophysiological data and mRIMA analysis of human and mouse pulmonary<br>
epithelia and other epithelial cells indicate that multiple P2XRs are broadly<br>
expressed in these tissues and that they are active on both apical and<br>
basolateral surfaces (Taylor et al,, 1999).<br>
P2RX7 is also expressed on human cutaneous keratinocytes where it has a role<br>
in the signalling system for regulation of proliferation, differentiation and<br>
apoptosis of epidermis (Greig et al., 2003a; Greig et al., 2003b). Further to the<br>
above-mentioned effects, in response to ATP-binding P2RX7 contributes to the<br>
release of the biologically active inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-1 beta,<br>
following activation of the cells of immune origin in which it is expressed such<br>
as LPS-primed macrophages (Verhoef et al., 2003). Involvement of P2RX7 in<br>
the production of the Inflammatory response of monocytes/macrophages makes<br>
it a good target against cell-mediated autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis.<br>
Expression of P2RX7 has also been detected on Multer glial cells from the<br>
human retina (Pannfcke et al., 2000) as weil as on pericytes of mlcrovessels<br>
isolated from the rat retina, where they regulate the multlceliular functional<br>
organization of the microvascular network (Kawamura et al., 2003). It has<br>
recently been demonstrated that stimulation of P2RX7 by means of agonists<br>
such as benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (BzATP) elevates Ca2+ and kills<br>
retinal ganglion cells (Zhang et al., 2005).<br>
Enhanced P2RX7 activity has been detected in human fibroblasts from diabetic<br>
patients, suggesting a possible pathogenetic mechanism for vascular damage in<br>
diabetes (Solini et al., 2004).<br>
Experiments carried out with mice lacking P2RX7 demonstrate that<br>
inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity is completely absent to both<br>
mechanical and thermal stimuli in mutant mice, whilst normal nociceptive<br>
processing is preserved (Chessell et al., 2005). The knockout animals were<br>
unimpaired in their ability to produce mRNA for pro-IL-1 beta, and cytometric<br>
analysts of paw and systemic cytokines from knockout and wild-type animals<br>
following adjuvant insult suggested a selective effect of the gene deletion on<br>
release of IL-lbeta and IL-10, This piece of evidence, together with the fact<br>
that P2RX7 was upregulated in human dorsal root ganglia and injured nerves<br>
obtained from chronic neuropathic pain patients, served to hypothesise that<br>
P2RX7, via regulation of mature IL-1 beta production, plays a role in the<br>
development of pain of neuropathic and inflammatory origin (Chessell et al.,<br>
2005). Drugs which block this target may have the potential to deliver broadspectrum<br>
a nalgesia.<br>
The above-mentioned experimental evidence, therefore, points to inhibition of<br>
P2RX7 as an efficient treatment for diseases such as neuronal degeneration,<br>
reperfuslon or ischemia in stroke or heart attack, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthntis, asthma,<br>
rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel<br>
disease (IB D) such as Crohn's disease), allergies, autoimmune diseases, cancer<br>
(such as le ukaemia, non-metenoma skin cancer), skin-related conditions (such<br>
as psoriasis, eczema, atopeda), retinal diseases and treatment of pain of<br>
neuropathic and inflammatory origin.<br>
A novel approach to exert this inhibition is the down regulation of P2RX7 gene<br>
expression mediated by RNA interference (RNAi).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention we describe a method for the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of neuronal degeneration or other diseases related to high levels of<br>
P2RX7. The method is based on the downregulation of expression of one or<br>
more splice forms of the P2RX7 gene. Downregulation may be effected by the<br>
use of double stranded nucleic acid moieties, named siNA or small interfering<br>
NA that are directed at interfering with the mRNA expression of either one or<br>
more splicing forms of the P2RX7 gene. The silMA are preferably siRNA,<br>
although modified nucleic acids or similar chemically synthesised entities are<br>
also i nduded within the scope of the invention.<br>
Embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions for use in<br>
the treatment of neuronal degeneration conditions and of other animal<br>
(including human) diseases related to high levels of P2RX7.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Design of siNA<br>
Although the mechanisms for RNAi remain unknown, the steps required to<br>
generate the specific dsRNA oligonudeotides are dear. It has been shown that<br>
dsRNA duplex strands that are 21-26 nucleotfdes in length work most<br>
effectively in produdng RNA interference. Selecting the right homologous<br>
region within the gene is also important. Factors such as the distance from start<br>
codon, the G/C content and the location of adenosine dimers are important<br>
when considering the generation of dsRNA for RNA5. One consequence of this,<br>
however, is that one may need to test several different sequences for the most<br>
efficient RNAi and this may become costly.<br>
In 1999, Tuschl et al. deciphered the silencing effect of siRIMAs showing that<br>
their efficiency is a function of the length of the duplex, the length of the 3'-end<br>
overhangs, and the sequence in these overhangs. Based on this founder work,<br>
Eurogentec recommends that the target mRNA region, and hence the sequence<br>
of the siRNA duplex, should be chosen using the following guidelines:<br>
Since RNAi relies on the establishment of complex protein interactions, it is<br>
obvious that the mRNA target should be devoided of unrelated bound factors.<br>
In this context, both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and regions<br>
close to the start codon should be avoided as they may be richer in regulatory<br>
protein binding sites. The sequence of the siRNA is therefore selected as<br>
follows:<br>
. In the mRNA sequence, a region located 50 to 100 nt downstream of the<br>
AUG start codon or upstream of stop codon is selected.<br>
. In this region, the following sequences are searched for: M(N19), CA(N19).<br>
. The G/C percentage for each identified sequence is calculated. Ideally, the<br>
G/C content is 50 % but it must less than 70 % and greater than 30 %.<br>
Preferably, sequences containing following repetitions are avoided: AAA,<br>
CCC, GGG, TTT, AAAA, CCCC, GGGG, TTTT.<br>
• An accessibility prediction according to the secondary structure of the<br>
mRNA is carried out as well.<br>
• A BLAST is also performed (i.e. NCBI ESTs database) with the nucleotide<br>
sequence fitting best the previous criteria to ensure that only one gene will<br>
be inactivated.<br>
In order to maximize the result's interpretation, the following precautions<br>
should be taken when using sJRNAs:<br>
• Always test the sense and antisense single strands in separate experiments.<br>
• Try a scramble siRNA duplex. This should have the same nucleotide<br>
composition as your siRNA but lack significant sequence homology to any other<br>
gene (including yours).<br>
• If possible, knock-down the same gene with two independent siRNA duplexes<br>
to control the specificity of the silencing process.<br>
Practically, each of the selected genes is introduced as a nucleotide sequence in<br>
a prediction program that takes into account all the variables described above<br>
for the design of optimal ollgonucleotides. This program scans any mRNA<br>
nucleotide sequence for regions susceptible to be targeted by siRNAs. The<br>
output of this analysis is a score of possible siRNA oligonucleotides. The highest<br>
scores are used to design double stranded RNA oligonucleotides (typically 21 bp<br>
long, although other lengths are also possible) that are typically made by<br>
chemical synthesis.<br>
In addition to siRNA, modified nucleotides may also be used. We plan to test<br>
several chemical modifications that are well known in the art. These<br>
modifications are aimed at increasing stability or availability of the siNA.<br>
Examples of suitable modifications are described in the publications referenced<br>
below, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Studies show that replacing the B'-terminal nucleotide overhanging segments of<br>
a 21-mer siRNA duplex having two -nucleotide 3'-overhangs with<br>
deoxyribonucleotides does not have an adverse effect on RNAi activity.<br>
Replacing up to four nucleotides on each end of the siRNA with<br>
deoxyribonucleotides has been reported to be well tolerated, whereas complete<br>
substitution with deoxyribonucleotides results in no RNAi activity (Elbashir<br>
2001). In add-on, Boashir et al. also report that substrtutjon of siRNA with 21-<br>
O methyl nudeotides completely abolishes RNAi activity.<br>
Affinity modified nudeosides as described in WO2005/044976 may be used.<br>
This publication describes oligonudeotides comprising nudeosides modified so<br>
as to have increased or decreased affinity for their complementary nucleotide in<br>
the target mRNA and/or in the complementary siNA strand.<br>
GB2406568 describes alternative modified oligonudeotides chemically modified<br>
to provide improved resistance to degradation or improved uptake. Examples of<br>
such modifications include phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages, 2'-0-<br>
methyl ribonucleotides, 2-deoxy-fluoro ribonucleotides, 2'-deoxy<br>
ribonucleotides, "universal base" nucleotides, 5-C-methyl nucleotides, and<br>
inverted deoxyabasic residue incorporation.<br>
WO2004/029212 describes oligonudeotides modified to enhance the stability of<br>
the siRNA or to increase targeting efficiency. Modifications include chemical<br>
cross linking between the two complementary strands of an siRNA and chemical<br>
modification of a 3' terminus of a strand of an siRNA. Preferred modifications<br>
are internal modifications, for example, sugar modifications, nucleobase<br>
modifications and/or backbone modifications. 2'-fluoro modified ribonucleotides<br>
and Z'-deoxy ribonucleotides are described.<br>
W02005/040537 further recites modified oligonucleotides which may be used in<br>
the invention.<br>
As weJI as making use of dsNA and modified dsNA, the present invention may<br>
use short hairpin NA (shNA); the two strands of the siNA molecule may be<br>
connected by a linker region, which may be a nucleotide linker or a nonnudeotide<br>
linker.<br>
In addition to siNA which is perfectly complementary to the target region,<br>
degenerate siNA sequences may be used to target homologous regions.<br>
WO2005/045037 describes the design of siNA molecules to target such<br>
homologous sequences, for example by incorporating non-canonical base pairs,<br>
for example mismatches and/or wobble base pairs, that can provide additional<br>
target sequences. In instances where mismatches are identified, non-canonical<br>
base pairs (for example, mismatches and/or wobble bases) can be used to<br>
generate siNA molecules that target more than one gene sequence. In a nonlimiting<br>
example, non-canonical base pairs such as UU and CC base pairs are<br>
used to generate siNA molecules that are capable of targeting sequences for<br>
differing targets that share sequence homology. As such, one advantage of<br>
using siNAs of the invention is that a single siNA can be designed to include<br>
nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the nucleotide sequence that is<br>
conserved between homologous genes. In this approach, a single siNA can be<br>
used to inhibit expression of more than one gene instead of using more than<br>
one siNA molecule to target different genes.<br>
Preferred siNA molecules of the Invention are double stranded. A siNA molecule<br>
of the invention may comprise blunt ends, that is, ends that do not include any<br>
overhanging nudeotides. In one embodiment, an siNA molecule of the<br>
invention can comprise one or more blunt ends. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
siNA molecules have 3' overhangs. siNA molecules of the invention may<br>
comprise duplex nucleic acid molecules with 3' overhangs of n nudeotides<br>
(5&gt;n&gt;l). Elbashir (2001) shows that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes are most<br>
active when containing 3'-terminal dinucleotide overhangs.<br>
Candidate oligonucleotides are further filtered for interspecles sequence<br>
conservation in order to facilitate the transition from animal to human clinical<br>
studies. In preferred embodiments of the invention, conserved oligonucleotides<br>
are used; this allows a single oligonudeotide sequence to be used in both<br>
animal models and human dinical trials.<br>
GenBank Accession Numbers corresponding ID P2RX7 transcripts produced by<br>
alternative spitoing are displayed in Figure 1.<br>
Selected oligonudeotide sequences against which RNAi is directed are shown in<br>
Rgure 2. Displayed sequences are the DNA sequences targeted by the siNA.<br>
Therefore, the invention would make use of NA duplexes with sequences<br>
complementary to the indicated DNA sequences.<br>
The sequences displayed in Figure 2 are not limiting. As a matter of fact, target<br>
DNA need not necessarily be preceded by AA or CA. Further, target DNA could<br>
be constituted by sequences included in Figure 2 flanked by any contiguous<br>
sequence.<br>
In vitro studies.<br>
Obtaining siRNA duplexes<br>
RNAs are preferably chemically synthesized using appropriately protected<br>
ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer.<br>
Substitution of one or both strands of a siRNA duplex by 2'-deoxy or 2'-O<br>
methyl oligoribonucleotides abolished silencing in fly extract (Elbashir et al.<br>
2001). In mammalian cells, however, it seems possible to substitute the sense<br>
siRNA by a 2'-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide (Ge et al. 2003).<br>
Most conveniently, siRNAs are obtained from commercial RNA oligo synthesis<br>
suppliers, which sell RNA-synthesis products of different quality and costs. In<br>
general, 21-nt RNAs are not too difficult to synthesize and are readily provided<br>
in a quality suitable for RNAI.<br>
Suppliers of RNA synthesis reagents include Proligo (Hamburg, Germany),<br>
Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO, USA), Glen Research (Sterling, VA, USA),<br>
ChemGenes (Ashland, MA, USA), and Cruachem (Glasgow, UK), Qiagen<br>
(Germany), Ambton (USA) and Invitrogen (Scotland). The previous custom RNA<br>
synthesis companies are entitled to provide siRNAs with a license for target<br>
validation. In particular, our siRNA suppliers are Amblon, Dharmacon and<br>
Invitrogen, companies that offer the traditional custom chemical synthesis<br>
service for siRNA, and supply the siRNA with HPLC purification and delivered in<br>
dry form along with RNase-free water. A central web-based resource for RNAi<br>
and siRNA methodologies, along with links to additional siRNA related products<br>
and services, can be found on the website of above-mentioned suppliers.<br>
An annealing step is necessary when working with single-stranded RNA<br>
molecules. It is critical that all handling steps be conducted under sterile, Rnase<br>
free conditions. To anneal the RNAs, the oligos must first be quantified by UV<br>
absorption at 260 nanometres (nm). The following protocol based on Elbashir<br>
et al. (2001) is then used for annealing:<br>
• Separately aliquot and dilute each RNA oligo to a concentration of 50 uM.<br>
• Combine 30 ul of each RNA oligo solution and 15 ul of 5X annealing buffer.<br>
Final buffer concentration is: 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH<br>
pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate. Final volume is 75 ul.<br>
• Incubate the solution for 1 minute at 90 °C, centrifuge the tube for 15<br>
seconds, let sit for 1 hour at 37 °C, then use at ambient temperature. The<br>
solution can be stored frozen at -20 °C and freeze-thawed up to 5 times. The<br>
final concentration of siRNA duplex is usually 20 uM.<br>
Alternatively, already annealed dsRNAs may be purchased from the suppliers.<br>
Chemically modified nucleic acids may also be used. For example, an overview<br>
of the types of modification which may be used is given in WO03/070744, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Particular attention is<br>
drawn to pages 11 to 21 of this publication. Other possible modifications are as<br>
described above. The skilled person will be aware of other types of chemical<br>
modification which may be incorporated into RNA molecules.<br>
*In vitro" system<br>
To check the spedflcHy of the sIRNA interference cell cultures and organotypic<br>
cultures both expressing the target gene, were employed.<br>
The cells used for these experiments were murine muscle cells, .C2C12, and the<br>
organotypic cultures were spinal cord slices. The levels of P2RX7 expression<br>
were analyzed after being incubated with the corresponding siRNA duplexes.<br>
For linking siRNA knockdown to specific phenotypes in cultured cells, it is<br>
necessary to demonstrate the decrease of the targeted protein or at least to<br>
demonstrate the reduction of the targeted mRNA.<br>
mRNA levels of the target gene can be quantitated by Real-time quantitative<br>
PCR (qRT-PCR). Further, the protein levels can be determined in a variety of<br>
ways well known in the art, such as Western blot analysis with specific<br>
antibodies to the different target allow direct monitoring of the reduction of<br>
targeted protein.<br>
Transfection of siRNA duplexes in cell cultures.<br>
Several examples of techniques well known in the art are as follows: We can<br>
perform a single transfection of siRNA duplex using a cationic lipid, such as<br>
Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and assay for silencing 24, 48 and 72<br>
hours after transfection.<br>
A typical transfection protocol can be performed as follows: For one well of a 6-<br>
well plate, we transfect using 100 or 200nM as final concentration of siRNA.<br>
Following Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent protocol, the day before transfection, we<br>
seed 2-4 x 10s cells per well in 3ml of an appropriate growth medium,<br>
containing DMEM, 10% serum, antibiotics and glutamine, and incubate cells<br>
under normal growth conditions (37°C and 5% CO2). On the day of<br>
transfection, celte have to be at 30-50% confluence. We dilute 12.5ul of 20uM<br>
siRNA duplex (corresponding to 100 nM final concentration) or 25ul of 20uM<br>
siRNA duplex (corresponding to 200nM final concentration) in 250ul of DMEM<br>
and mix. Also, 6ul of Lipofectamine 2000 is diluted in 250ul of DMEM and<br>
mixed. After a 5 minutes incubation at room temperature, the diluted oligomer<br>
(siRNA duplex) and the diluted Upofectamine are combined to allow complex<br>
formation during a 20 minutes incubation at room temperature. Afterwards, we<br>
add the complexes drop-wise onto the cells with 2 ml of fresh growth medium<br>
low in antibiotics and mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth, to ensure<br>
uniform distribution of the transfection complexes. We incubate the cells under<br>
their normal growth conditions and the day after the complexes are removed<br>
and fresh and complete growth medium is added. To monitor gene silencing<br>
cells are collected at 24,48 and 72h post-transfection.<br>
The efficiency of transfection may depend on the cell type, but also on the<br>
passage number and the confluency of the cells. The time and the manner of<br>
formation of siRNA-liposome complexes (e.g. inversion versus vortexing) are<br>
also critical. Low transfection efficiencies are the most frequent cause of<br>
unsuccessful silencing. Good transfection is a non-trivial issue and needs to be<br>
carefully examined for each new cell line to be used. Transfection efficiency<br>
may be tested transfecting reporter genes, for example a CMV-driven EGFPexpression<br>
plasmid (e.g. from Clontech) -or a B-Gal expression plasmid, and<br>
then assessed by phase contrast and/or fluorescence microscopy the next day.<br>
Testing of siRNA duplexes<br>
Depending on the abundance and the life time (or turnover) of the targeted<br>
protein, a knock-down phenotype may become apparent after 1 to 3 days, or<br>
even later. In cases where no phenotype is observed, depletion of the protein<br>
may be observed by immunofiuorescence or Western blotting.<br>
After transfections, total RNA fractions extracted from cells were pre-treated<br>
with DNase I and used for reverse transcription using a random primer. PCRamplifled<br>
with a specific primer pair covering at least one exon-exon junction in<br>
order to control for amplification of pre-mRNAs. RT/PCR of a non-targeted<br>
mRNA is also needed as control. Effective depletion of the mRNA yet<br>
undetectabte reduction of target protein may indicate that a large reservoir of<br>
stable protein may exist in the cell. Alternatively, Real-time PCR amplification<br>
can be used to test in a more precise way the mRNA decrease or<br>
disappearance. Real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR quantitates the Initial<br>
amount of the template most specifically, sensitively and reproducibly. Realtime<br>
PCR monitors the fluorescence emitted during the reaction as an indicator<br>
of amplicon production during each PCR cycle, in a light cycler apparatus. This<br>
signal increases in direct proportion to the amount of PCR product in a reaction.<br>
By recording the amount of fluorescence emission at each cycle, it is possible to<br>
monitor the PCR reaction during exponential phase where the first significant<br>
increase in the amount of PCR product correlates to the initial amount of target<br>
template.<br>
To verify the interference pattern of the differentially expressed P2RX7 gene in<br>
the cell cultures, qRT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer<br>
protocol (Roche). For quantitative qRT-PCR, approximately 500 ng of total RNA<br>
were used for reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification with specific<br>
primers for each gene in reaction mixture containing Master 5YBR Green I. The<br>
PCR conditions were an initial step of 30 min at 91 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 5<br>
s at 95°C, 10 s at 62°C and 15 s at 72°C. Quantification of b-actin mRNA was<br>
used as a control for data normalization. Relative gene expression comparisons<br>
work best when the gene expression of the chosen endogenous/internal control<br>
is more abundant and remains constant, in proportion to total RNA, among the<br>
samples. By using an invariant endogenous control as an active reference,<br>
quantltation of an mRNA target can be normalised for differences in the amount<br>
of total RNA added to each reaction. The amplification curves obtained with the<br>
light cycler were analyzed in combination with the control kit RNA, which<br>
targets in vitro transcribed cytokine RNA template, according to the<br>
manufacturer protocol. In order to assess the specificity of the amplified PCR<br>
product a melting curve analysis was performed. The resulting melting curves<br>
allow discrimination between primer-dimers and specific PCR product.<br>
Transfectkm of siRNA duplexes in organotypic cultures<br>
To obtain spinal cord organotypic cultures, the experimental protocol was<br>
performed as follows: The spinal cord was extracted from 6 to 8 week old rats<br>
and placed in ice-cold dissecting media containing Gey's Medium supplemented<br>
with D-Glucose (6.5 mg/ml) and 15mM Hepes. To generate the organotypic<br>
cultures, 500 urn slices from the thoracic spinal cord were obtained using a<br>
tissue chopper and placed in sterile MEM supplemented with Earl's salt solution.<br>
Spinal slices were transferred onto Millicell culture plates. Each plate, containing<br>
4 to 6 slices, was placed into wells of a six-well plate containing 1.25ml of<br>
antibiotic-free medium (50% MEM with Earl's salts and glutamine, 25% Hanks<br>
balanced salt solution and 25% Horse Serum supplemented with D-Glucose<br>
(6mg/ml) and 20mM Hepes).<br>
Slices were incubated under normal growth conditions (37°C and 5% C02) and<br>
media was changed the day after and, afterwards, three times a week.<br>
In these conditions, spinal cord organotypic cultures maintain their structural<br>
integrity for at least 15 days and present high levels of the P2RX7 transcript.<br>
Also, P2RX7 gene expression, checked by quantitative PCR assays, does not<br>
present any relevant change along the culture period.<br>
To perform siRNA transfections there are several protocols and techniques well<br>
known in the art. In this case a double transfection is needed to observe an<br>
enhanced gene expression inhibition. Double siRNA transfections were<br>
performed using a cationic lipid, such as Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent<br>
(Invitrogen) and gene expression silencing was assayed at different time points.<br>
A typical transfection protocol can be performed as folbws. Each Millicell culture<br>
plate, containing 4 to 6 slices, is transfected using a determined concentration<br>
of siRNA. Following Upofectamlne 2000 Reagent protocol for siRNA<br>
transfection, we dilute the amount of siRNA duplex in 50ul of MEM and mix. In<br>
a different tube, the Lipofectamine 2000 are diluted in 50ul of MEM and mixed.<br>
After 5 minutes incubation at room temperature, the diluted siRNA and the<br>
diluted Lipofectamine are combined to allow complex formation during 20<br>
minutes incubation at room temperature. Afterwards, the complexes are added<br>
drop-wise over the slices. We incubate the slices under their normal growth<br>
conditions and the day after, the complexes are removed and fresh and<br>
complete growth medium is added. When necessary, 48h after the first<br>
Lipofectamine treatment the protocol is repeated as previously described.<br>
The efficiency of transfection may depend on the cell or tissue type, but also on<br>
their culture characteristics. The time and the manner of formation of siRNAliposome<br>
complexes are also critical. Low transfection efficiencies are the most<br>
frequent cause of unsuccessful silencing. Good transfection is a non-trivial issue<br>
and needs to be carefully examined for each new cell line to be used.<br>
Transfection efficiency may be tested transfecting reporter genes, for example<br>
a CMV-driven EGFP-expression plasmid (e.g. from Clontech) or a p-Gal<br>
expression plasmid, and then assessed by phase contrast and/or fluorescence<br>
microscopy the next day. Spinal cord organotypic cultures were successfully<br>
transfected with a p-Gal encoded construct reporter. The enzymatic activity of<br>
bacterial. p-Gal can be assayed readily from transfected tissue with an<br>
appropriate commercial staining set.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations<br>
The present invention may comprise the administration of one or more species<br>
of siNA molecule simultaneously. These species may be selected to target one<br>
or more target genes.<br>
The SJNA molecules of the Invention and formulatjons or compositions thereof<br>
may be administered directly or topically (e. g., locally) to the organ of interest<br>
(for example, spinal cordf brain, etc) as is generally known in the art For<br>
example, a sINA molecule can comprise a delivery vehicle, including liposomes,<br>
for administration to a subject. Carriers and diluents and their salts can be<br>
present in pharmaceutlcally acceptable formulations. Nucleic acid molecules can<br>
be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those of skill in the<br>
art, including, but not restricted to, encapsulation in liposomes, by<br>
iontophoresis, or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as biodegradable<br>
polymers, hydrogels, cyclodextrins poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and<br>
PICA microspheres, biodegradable nanocapsuies, and bioadhesive<br>
microspheres, or by proteinaceous vectors. In another embodiment, the nucleic<br>
acid molecules of the invention can also be formulated or complexed with<br>
polyethyleneimine and derivatives thereof, such as polyethyleneiminepolyethyleneglycol-<br>
N-acetylgalactosamine (PEI-PEG-GAL) or polyethyleneiminepolyethyleneglycol-<br>
tri-N-acetylgalactosamine (PEI-PEG-triGAL) derivatives.<br>
A siNA molecule of the invention may be complexed with membrane disruptive<br>
agents and/or a cationic lipid or helper lipid molecule.<br>
Delivery systems which may be used with the invention include, for example,<br>
aqueous and non aqueous gels, creams, multiple emulsions, microemulsions,<br>
liposomes, ointments, aqueous and non aqueous solutions, lotions, aerosols,<br>
hydrocarbon bases and powders, and can contain excipients such as<br>
solubilizers, permeation enhancers (e. g., fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty<br>
alcohols and amino acids), and hydrophilic polymers (e. g. , polycarbophil and<br>
polyvinylpyrolidone). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier is a liposome or a transdermal enhancer.<br>
A pharmaceutical formulation of the invention is in a form suitable for<br>
administration, e.g., systemic or local administration, into a cell or subject,<br>
Including for example a human. Suitable forms, in part; depend upon the use or<br>
the route of entry, for example oral, transdermal, or by injection. Other factors<br>
are known in the art, and include considerations such as toxidty and forms that<br>
prevent the composition or formulation from exerting its effect.<br>
The present invention also includes compositions prepared for storage or<br>
administration that include a pharmaceuticaHy effective amount of the desired<br>
compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Acceptable<br>
carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical<br>
art. For example, preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and flavouring agents can be<br>
provided. These include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of phydroxybenzoic<br>
acid. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents can be<br>
used.<br>
A pharmaceutically effective dose is that dose required to prevent, inhibit the<br>
occurrence, or treat (alleviate a symptom to some extent, preferably all of the<br>
symptoms) of a disease state. The pharmaceutically effective dose depends on<br>
the type of disease, the composition used, the route of administration, the type<br>
of mammal being treated, the physical characteristics of the specific mammal<br>
under consideration, concurrent medication, and other factors that those skilled<br>
in the medical arts will recognize.<br>
Generally, an amount between O.lmg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br>
active ingredients is administered.<br>
The formulations of the invention can be administered in unit dosage<br>
formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers, adjuvants and/or vehicles. Formulations can be in a form suitable for<br>
oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily<br>
suspensions, dlspersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules,<br>
or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use can be prepared<br>
according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more<br>
such sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents or preservative<br>
agents in order to provide pharmaceutkally eiegant and palatable preparations.<br>
Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable exdpients that are suitable for the manufacture of<br>
tablets.<br>
These excipients can be, for example, inert diluents; such as calcium carbonate,<br>
sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate;<br>
granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginlc acid;<br>
binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents,<br>
for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets can be<br>
uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques. In some cases such<br>
coatings can be prepared by known techniques to delay disintegration and<br>
absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action<br>
over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules<br>
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example,<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules<br>
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example<br>
peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in a mixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are<br>
suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, hydropropyl- methylcellufose, sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrondone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting<br>
agents can be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or<br>
condensation products of an atkytene oxide with fatty adds, for example<br>
poJyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long<br>
chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or<br>
condensation products of ethytene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty<br>
acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethyiene sorbitol monooleate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty<br>
acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate.<br>
The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, for<br>
example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents,<br>
one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as<br>
sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a<br>
vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a<br>
mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions can contain a thickening<br>
agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents<br>
and flavouring agents can be added to provide palatable oral preparations.<br>
These compositions can be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as<br>
ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture<br>
with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more<br>
preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents or suspending agents are<br>
exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for<br>
example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, can also be present.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be in the form of oil-inwater<br>
emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil or a mineral oil or<br>
mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents can be naturally-occurring gums,<br>
for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides,<br>
for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty<br>
adds and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for<br>
example polyoxyethytene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions can also contain<br>
sweetening and flavouring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs can be formulated with sweetening agents, for example<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, glucose or sucrose. Such formulations can<br>
also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those<br>
suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents that have been<br>
mentioned above.<br>
A sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or<br>
suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example<br>
as a solution in 1,3- butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents<br>
that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent<br>
or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil can be employed<br>
including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic<br>
acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of suppositories, e. g. , for rectal administration of the drug. These<br>
compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating<br>
excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal<br>
temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such<br>
materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Nudeic acid molecules of the invention can be administered parenterally in a<br>
sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used,<br>
can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants<br>
such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved<br>
in the vehicle.<br>
It is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject depends<br>
upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination<br>
and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
For administration to non-human animals, the composition can also be added to<br>
the animal feed or drinking water. It can be convenient to formulate the animal<br>
feed and drinking water compositions so that the animal takes in a<br>
therapeutically appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet. It<br>
can also be convenient to present the composition as a premix for addition to<br>
the feed or drinking water.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can also be administered to<br>
a subject in combination with other therapeutic compounds to increase the<br>
overall therapeutic effect The use of multiple compounds to treat an indication<br>
ca n increase the beneficial effects while reducing the presence of side effects.<br>
Alternatively, certain siNA molecules of the invention can be expressed within<br>
cells from eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant vectors capable of expressing the<br>
siNA molecules can be delivered and persist in target cells. Alternatively, vectors<br>
can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules.<br>
Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the<br>
siNA molecule interacts with the target mRNA and generates an RNAi response.<br>
Delivery of siNA motecute expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by<br>
intravenous or Intra-rnuscular administration, by administration to target cells<br>
ex-planted from a subject followed by relntroduciion Into the subject, or by any<br>
other means that would allow for Introduction into the desired target cell.<br>
Results<br>
Example 1. In vitro assays.<br>
A panel of siRNA against the P2RX7 target gene has been analyzed. The first<br>
step was to perform experiments in cell cultures. For the P2RX7 target gene,<br>
several siRNAs were designed using a specific software according to the rules<br>
described before. Those with the best characteristics were selected to be<br>
tested. The siRNAs were applied to cell cultures, such as C2C12. The effect of<br>
siRNAs over the target gene was analyzed by Real-time PCR according to the<br>
manufacturer's protocol. The gene target transcript levels were normalized<br>
using actin as housekeeping gene. Some of the different siRNAs that were<br>
tested and their different efficacies in the interference of the target gene are<br>
included in Rgure 3. RNA was prepared from C2C12 cells treated with different<br>
siRJMAs for 48h. The samples were analyzed by real time PCR using specific<br>
primers. The values show the mean expression levels of different transcripts<br>
normalized to actin relative to cell control. siRNAl, siRNA2 and siRNA3 target<br>
the murine sequences homologous to the human sequences listed in Figure 2<br>
as follows: siRNAl targets the murine sequence homologous to human SEQ, ID.<br>
37; siRNAZ targets the murine sequence homologous to human SEQ. ID. 78;<br>
and SIRNA3 targets the murine sequence homologous to human SEQ. ID. 92.<br>
The values represent the mean of the percentage of the normalized mRNA<br>
levels upon siRNA interference over the control gene expression and their<br>
standard deviations. The level of the P2RX7 transcript after the siRNA treatment<br>
was highly reduced with siRNA2 and siRNA3, compared to the control cells. The<br>
decrease of the gene expression depends on the efficiency in siRNA silencing.<br>
In fact, siRNA2 treatment decreased the P2RX7 gene expression to 58 %<br>
compared to the control.<br>
Example 2. Time-dose response in vitro.<br>
In order to validate the efficiency of siRNAZ, more treatments were carried out<br>
in C2C12 cells. Cells were transfected with sfRNAZ and the level of P2RX7<br>
transcript was analyzed by Real-time PCR at 24, 48 and 72 h. The level of the<br>
transcript was significantly reduced at this time points after the siRNA<br>
treatment. Rgure 4 shows the mean of the percentage of the normalized mRNA<br>
P2RX7 levels upon siRNA interference over the control gene expression at each<br>
time point and their standard deviations. Moreover a siRNA dose-response was<br>
analyzed. Figure 4 shows the results of two different siRNA applications (100<br>
and 200nm). 200nm siRNA applications were more effective in the P2RX7<br>
downregulatlon than those with lOOnm, confirming both the specificity and the<br>
effectiveness of the treatment.<br>
Example 3. Organotypic cultures.<br>
Previously to the siRNA spinal cord application, we performed in vitro<br>
experiments using an established model based on spinal cord slice cultures. It is<br>
essential to use appropriate experimental models in order to understand the<br>
complex processes which evolve after the initial trauma. This model facilitated<br>
the investigation of primary and secondary mechanisms of cell death that<br>
occurs after spinal cord injury and represents a step before study of the effect<br>
of P2RX7 interference in murine models is undertaken. Several in vivo models<br>
have been characterized to study the chronic pathology. However, due to the<br>
complexity of the in vivo system, interpretation of results may be more difficult,<br>
plus the cost of maintaining an animal model is very high. In order to study the<br>
events after trauma the in vitro models are preferred, as these allow precise<br>
control over the environment, and easy and repeated access.<br>
Previously to the experiment, the morphological integrity of cultures was<br>
examined by microscopy and the delivery in this model was carried out<br>
transfectrng a reporter gene (p-gal) according to the described protocol. Upon<br>
transfecting cells with a p-gal construct, spinal cords were fixed, washed and<br>
stained with freshly prepared X-gal staining solution. Blue staining appeared<br>
upon 24 h indicating a successfully delivery.<br>
Two siRNAs were selected according to different criteria, siRNAH and siRNAR.<br>
siRNAH targets the rat sequence homologous to human SEQ. ID. 58 of Figure<br>
2, while siRNAR targets the best candidate sequence in rat, selected by specific<br>
software, homologous to human SEQ. ID. 37 of Figure 2. Spinal cord cultures<br>
were obtained as previously described. Each plate was double transfected with<br>
the corresponding siRNA and gene expression was assayed at 72 and 96 h after<br>
the first transfection by Real- time PCR.<br>
Figure 5 shows a representative experiment. Values represent the percentage<br>
of mRNA transcript relative to the control after siRNA treatment once<br>
normalized using IBS as the reference housekeeping gene. Previous<br>
experiments indicated 18S as a better reference than p actin in spinal cord<br>
cultures analysis. The decrease in P2RX7 transcript is higher at 72 h being<br>
around 70%, at 96h there is less reduction, around 80-90%. This set of<br>
experiments confirms the ability of RNAi to reduce P2RX7 expression in an<br>
organotypic culture very close to an in vivo model.<br>
