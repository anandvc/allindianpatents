				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication tower. More particularly<br>
the present invention relates to a portable communication tower for wireless<br>
communication transmission or mobile station that can be easily transported and rapidly<br>
assembled in place of use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In a wireless communication applications or telecommunication network, e.g a<br>
mobile telephone network, it is crucial to install in a territory a set of antennas mounted on<br>
suitable towers at each station. The station normally comprises a set of electrical and<br>
electronic telecommunication equipments for receiving and transmitting the radio signals<br>
of the antennas, ancillary equipments is well as other equipments.<br>
In specific regions and for specific periods, particularly during emergency<br>
situations, it is necessary to rapidly install a telecommunication station suitably covering a<br>
region otherwise being not covered or having a limited coverage. Such problem is solved<br>
by transporting in a semi-trailer a tower for radio antennas to the place of use. By means<br>
of the same semi-trailer or by meant! of another motor vehicle, all the equipments and<br>
infrastructures for installing the station are also transported to the place of use. By external<br>
means, such as e.g a crane, the station is built and the tower is raised, finally the antennas<br>
are mounted thereon.<br>
The installations of the said station are relatively difficult as it involves<br>
transporting all the equipments ;uid infrastructure into remote locations. The<br>
telecommunication equipments, mast or tower have to be transported separately. Transport<br>
of the materials required for construct ng the telecommunication station and the raising of<br>
the tower for the antennas, obviousiy required a great waste of means and time. In<br>
addition, some regions cannot be reached by the semi-trailer and/or by the cranes.<br>
Once the telecommunication service is performed, the emergency<br>
telecommunication station must be dismantled to be transportable elsewhere or be stored.<br>
In order to do so, it is necessary to carry out in reverse order all the complex operations,<br>
which result in high costs and longer working times.<br>
Another common practice of prior art utilizes a stationary foundation formed by a<br>
mast base which is firmly anchored in the ground. This prior art is similar to that utilized<br>
for permanently erected mast or tower. This approach requires significant site preparation<br>
including tower installation. Moreover, this practice is unfavorable in several respects.<br>
Firstly, .both the construction and the subsequent removal of the mast or tower base is very<br>
time consuming and costly. Additionally, the use of such mast or tower base involves a<br>
substantial penetration into ground, which is unacceptable in certain environmentally<br>
sensitive regions such as mountain regions or in coastal regions. In order to avoid above<br>
disadvantages, a specially designed transport vehicle is used as a mast base for temporary<br>
erection of mast. However, such transport vehicle is very expensive and does not offer a<br>
sufficiently stable foundation for the mast beyond a certain height and does not permit the<br>
mast to remain erected thereon unattended for longer periods of time. Due to insufficient<br>
stable foundation, such mast is limited to 10 meters height. In addition, the transport<br>
vehicle station requires frequent maintenance.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a portable mobile<br>
telecommunication tower free from aforementioned drawbacks. The present invention<br>
provides a mobile communication tower which is readily transportable, rapidly erected<br>
and installed to put into service. The present invention can also be subsequently removed<br>
from the place of use in a simple, quack and safe way. The present invention has for its<br>
purpose provide an improved mast or tower base which avoids the above disadvantages<br>
and is well suited to use for supposing a temporarily erected mast or tower during<br>
extended periods of time, and it also can be permanently used without requiring frequent<br>
attendance.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

the center portion (36) of the base panel and extended through the removably or openably<br>
roof panel (28) at the upper supporting frame (26) of the cage (12).<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates structure of mast or lattice tower (14) in accordance with<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention. The mast or lattice tower (14) is preferably<br>
constructed in modular form from pieces of elongated tubing. Angle bars, rectangular bars<br>
or any polygonal hollow bars may be used. The sectional mast is preferably constructed in<br>
form of square in cross-section; though triangular cross-section structure can be used. The<br>
end portions of each sectional mast are provided with angle bars (44) or metal plates. Said<br>
angle bars (44) or metal plates are provided with a plurality of apertures serving as a<br>
connecting member. Each sectional mast or lattice tower from uppermost to lowermost<br>
sections is all constructed in identical form but in different predetermined size for each<br>
sectional mast. Thus, allowing said sectional mast to be assembled section-by-section by<br>
means of bolts and nuts or other suitable quick fastening means. Moreover, each<br>
individual section of mast can be dismantled and kept storage into the cage (12).<br>
FIGS. 5a - 5j illustrate a kit parts for the mast or lattice tower (14), comprising an<br>
uppermost mast section (51), intermediate mast sections (52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57),<br>
lowermost mast section (58), and booms (49, 50). The completed mobile communication<br>
tower (10) will also include accessories, telecommunication apparatus, weatherproof<br>
fluorescent light, weatherproof AC power distributor board, satellite dish or antenna (not<br>
shown). The booms (49, 50) are an elongated pole extending upward from the uppermost<br>
mast section (51) as a derrick to support telecommunication apparatus or as a guide for<br>
guy line/safety cables for lifting objects (not shown). The boom (49) is provided with<br>
adjustable brackets (48) slidably attached along the elongated pole for holding antenna.<br>
The design of the mast or lattice tower (14) can be extended to any required height by<br>
additional section of the mast. By way of example and not by way of limitation, each<br>
section of mast and boom is preferably of 2 meters height and a typical mast or lattice<br>
tower (14) is constructed in range of 0 meters to 40 meters in height.<br>
The installation of the mast or lattice tower (14) will now be described herein. The<br>
mast or lattice tower (14) is constructed section-by section (first in first up basis) by means<br>
of winch assembly. Each individual sections of the mast will be hoisted by hoist cable by<br>
the aid of winch. Referring to FIG. 6, the winch assembly comprises of a winch (60),<br>
pulleys (62a, 62b), and hoist cable (64). In practice, winch (60) is mounted to a winch<br>
<br>
supporting bracket (66) which is disposed at one side, on top adjacent to the roof panel<br>
(28) of the cage (12). There are two pulleys (62a) removeably mounted at two bottom<br>
sides of the sectional mast and another pulley (62b) is removeably mounted at the roof<br>
panel near under the winch supporting bracket (66). The hoist cable (64) is drawn from the<br>
winch (60) to the said pulleys (62a, 62b) and then anchored to a hook (68) disposed at the<br>
roof panel opposite to the pulley (62b). Hence, a hoisting loop (70) is formed which can<br>
be used to lift-up the sectional masi when the hoist cable (64) is winded-up. The winch<br>
(60) can be of manually/hand-power driven or motor-driven. Preferably, a manual winch<br>
with at least half tone loading capacity is used depending on the weight of the mast.<br>
Alternatively, a hydraulic jack may be used for lifting the sectional mast during the<br>
assembly process.<br>
The installation begins with assembly of the uppermost part of the mast where the<br>
booms (49, 50) are assembled onto top side of the uppermost section mast (51). The<br>
assembled booms (49, 50) and the uppermost mast section (51) will then be inserted into<br>
said hoisting loop (70) and lifted-up by the hoist cable (64) under a tensional force by the<br>
winch (60). After the uppermost mast section (51) has been raised high enough to provide<br>
clearance for insertion of another lower mast section, the winch (60) is temporarily locked<br>
against rotation so that the uppermost mast section (51) is maintained in its extended<br>
elevated position. A safety lock (721 further retains the extended section of the mast from<br>
slumping. The safety lock (72) may be disposed near the removable or openable roof panel<br>
(28) or disposed at bracing member. The next lower or intermediate mast section (52) will<br>
be then inserted into the hoisting loop (70) and line up attached in end-to-end relation with<br>
the uppermost mast section (51). The uppermost section mast (51) and the intermediate<br>
section mast (52) will then be mounted by means of plurality bolts and nuts or by any<br>
other suitable fastening means at ths angle bars (48). Again, the assembled mast sections<br>
are lifted-up to certain high and locked temporarily in place to provide clearance for next<br>
insertion of lower mast section. The same assembly processes are carried out to all the<br>
intermediate mast sections (53, 54, 55, 56) until the lowermost mast section (58) is placed.<br>
The lowermost mast section (58) is finally mounted on the base supporting frame (26),<br>
preferably at the center portion (361 of the cage (12) by means of bolts and nuts or other<br>
suitable fastening means.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, there is provided a bracing member (16) configured on<br>
top of the cage (12). The bracing member (16) comprises a plurality of circular hollow<br>
sections for supporting the erected mast or lattice tower (14). Particularly, the bracing<br>
member (16) is securely mounted on the four upper corners at top supporting frames (26)<br>
of the cage (12), and it serves as a supporting means to the mast or lattice tower (14). The<br>
said bracing member (16) also can be formed by angle bars or any other sectional bars for<br>
suitable used. In addition, the bracing member (16) restricts sway movement of the<br>
sectional mast during the lift-up or assembly process. The erected mast or lattice tower<br>
(14) is suitably stayed laterally by means of a number of stay wires (20). The stay wires<br>
(20) is connected to the upper portion of the mast and having their lower ends anchored to<br>
outer end portions of the supporting legs (18). The stay wires also can be anchored to any<br>
other supporting means such as a concrete block or on the ground.<br>
To this end, the configuration of the portable mobile communication tower (10)<br>
should be modular and self-contained, readily transportable, and can be quickly erected<br>
and installed on site and put into service. Moreover, the portable mobile communication<br>
tower (10) can be dismantled and/or removed therefrom in a simple, quick and safe<br>
operation once its service is performed, and it is readily transportable to elsewhere or to be<br>
stored. There are no complex operations and it reduces operation cost and working times.<br>
The present invention is not only well suited to use for supporting a temporarily erected<br>
mast or tower during extended periods of time, but also can be permanently used without<br>
requiring any frequent attendance.<br>
The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been<br>
presented for the purpose of illustration and description, rather than limitation. The<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention having been disclosed, however, various changes,<br>
substitutions or alteration may be made therein without departing from the principles and<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
