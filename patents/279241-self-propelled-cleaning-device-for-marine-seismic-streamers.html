Serial No. 11/633,266 filed on December 4, 2006, which is copending herewith.<br>
Statement regarding federally sponsored research or development<br>
Not applicable.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The invention relates generally to the field of marine seismic surveying<br>
apparatus. More specifically, the invention relates to apparatus for cleaning marine<br>
growth and other contaminants from seismic sensor streamers.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]	Marine seismic surveying includes having a seismic vessel tow one or more<br>
seismic sensor streamers near the surface of a body of water, such as the ocean.<br>
Sensor streamers are essentially cables that include a plurality of seismic sensors<br>
(usually hydrophones) disposed along the cable at spaced apart locations. The sensors<br>
may be protected from water intrusion by enclosing the cable and the sensors in a<br>
water tight, acoustically transparent jacket. The interior of the jacket is typically<br>
filled with oil, or electrically non-conductive, viscous gel-like materials, both to<br>
enable good acoustic coupling between the water and the hydrophones, and to provide<br>
electrical insulation between various electrical components, including the<br>
hydrophones, in the streamer.<br>
[0003]	Typical seismic streamers can extend for a substantial distance behind the<br>
towing vessel, often several kilometers. As is the case for many devices operated in a<br>
body of water, various marine life forms, such as barnacles and seaweed, can become<br>
 <br>
attached to the exterior of seismic streamers. Other contaminants may also become<br>
attached to the exterior of the streamer as well. The presence of such contaminants on<br>
a streamer, in addition to causing possible deterioration of the streamer, can cause<br>
changes in the response of the various sensors in the streamer because the life forms<br>
can interfere with transmission of seismic energy through the jacket and to the sensors<br>
therein. Such marine growth and other contaminants may cause noise in detected<br>
seismic signals and increase the drag. Cleaning such contaminants from the exterior<br>
of a streamer is therefore important.<br>
[0004]	Streamers can be cleaned of such attached marine growth and other<br>
contaminants using conventional methods such as brushing and scraping. Such<br>
conventional cleaning methods typically require the streamer to be retrieved from the<br>
water. Retrieval typically includes spooling or winding the streamer on a suitable<br>
winch or similar device. The streamer must then be transported to a facility where it<br>
may be unspooled and then cleaned conventionally. Such conventional cleaning<br>
procedures can be difficult and expensive to perform, and may require that the<br>
streamer be removed from service for a considerable period of time. Alternatively, a<br>
streamer can be scraped or cleaned manually from a boat moved alongside the<br>
streamer while the streamer is deployed in the water. Such cleaning operations can be<br>
difficult to perform, dangerous to personnel in the event of unexpected rough water,<br>
and, depending on the skill of the cleaning operator, may risk damage to the streamer.<br>
[0005]	One type of automatic streamer cleaning device is described in International<br>
Patent Application Publication No. WO 2004/051316 ("WO '316"). The streamer<br>
cleaning device described in WO '316 includes a housing configured to be affixed to<br>
the exterior of the streamer, a vane or similar device affixed to the housing causes the<br>
housing to move longitudinally along the streamer as the streamer is towed in the<br>
water. A friction drive, consisting of a series of wheels placed in contact with the<br>
outer surface of the streamer, converts the longitudinal motion of the housing to<br>
rotational energy to operate rotating brushes placed in contact with the streamer.<br>
[0006]	Another type of automatic streamer cleaning device is described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 11/227,795 filed on Sept. 15, 2005 and assigned to the<br>
assignee of the present invention. The streamer cleaning device disclosed in the '795<br>
application includes a housing that is configured to be removably affixed to the<br>
 <br>
exterior surface of the streamer. The housing includes at least one vane arranged to<br>
convert motion of the water therepast, as the streamer is towed into the water, into<br>
longitudinal force and rotational force on the housing. Such forces cause the housing<br>
to move longitudinally and rotationally about the entire exterior of the streamer. At<br>
least one cleaning element, such as a brush or scraper, is disposed inside the housing.<br>
The imparted motion of the housing causes corresponding motion of the cleaning<br>
element, thus cleaning the streamer.<br>
[0007]	The cleaning devices described in both WO '316 and in the '795 application<br>
are only able to move toward the back end of the streamer using energy generated by<br>
movement of water past the cleaning device as the streamer is towed through the<br>
water. In order to use either of the forgoing cleaning devices more than once on a<br>
streamer, it is necessary to remove the cleaning device from the aft end of the<br>
streamer, and reaffix the cleaning device at or near the front end of the streamer.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0008]	One aspect of the invention is a cleaning device for a seismic streamer. A<br>
cleaning device according to this aspect of the invention includes a housing placeable<br>
about the exterior of a seismic streamer. At least one turbine is associated with the<br>
housing and is configured to be rotationally driven by movement of the streamer<br>
through a body of water. At least one drive element is associated with the housing<br>
and is configured to convert rotational motion of the at least one turbine to motive<br>
power to move the housing along the streamer. At least one cleaning element is<br>
associated with the housing and is cooperatively engageable with the exterior of the<br>
seismic streamer.<br>
[0009]	A method for cleaning a marine streamer according to another aspect of the<br>
invention includes towing the streamer through a body of water. Motion of water past<br>
a cleaning device disposed on the streamer is converted into motive power to move<br>
the cleaning device along the streamer.<br>
[0010]	Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
following description and the appended claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0016]	FIG. 1 shows an automatic seismic streamer cleaning device as it is typically<br>
used on a marine seismic streamer. A seismic vessel 18 tows a marine seismic<br>
streamer 10 near the surface of a body of water 16. For purposes of familiarization,<br>
the seismic vessel 18 may include thereon various seismic data acquisition, data<br>
recording and navigation equipment, shown generally at 20 and collectively referred<br>
to as a "recording system", which controls operation of a seismic energy source 24,<br>
and records signals detected by various sensors 14 in the streamer 10. Energy emitted<br>
by the source 24 is reflected by various structures (not shown) below the bottom 22 of<br>
the body of water 16. Such reflected energy is ultimately detected by the sensors 14<br>
on the streamer 10 for recording by the recording system. The example<br>
implementation shown in FIG. 1 includes only one streamer, however it is known in<br>
the art for a single vessel to tow a plurality of streamers at laterally spaced apart<br>
positions behind the seismic vessel or another vessel. Accordingly, the actual<br>
configuration of vessels and streamers is not a limitation on the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0017]	As is known in the art, the streamer 10 typically includes an outer, generally<br>
cylindrically shaped jacket which may be made from a flexible, acoustically<br>
 <br>
transparent material such as polyurethane. Inside the jacket, the streamer 10 includes<br>
one or more strength members (not shown separately). Coupled to the strength<br>
members at spaced apart locations are flotation spacers (not shown separately) which<br>
provide the streamer 10 with a selected degree of buoyancy in the water 16. Some of<br>
the spacers (not shown) can include therein the one or more seismic sensors, shown<br>
schematically at 14 and which may be hydrophones, geophones or any other sensing<br>
device used to detect seismic energy. In a typical streamer, the foregoing components<br>
extend for a selected length, usually about 75 meters, in a so called "segment" before<br>
being terminated at each axial end thereof with some form of connector. A streamer<br>
may be formed from as many as 100 or more such interconnected segments. Thus,<br>
the majority of the length of the streamer 10 presents a substantially constant<br>
diameter, generally cylindrical exterior surface for application of various devices,<br>
including an automatic cleaning device 12 according to the invention. In some<br>
embodiments, the streamer 10 may include a stop 11 disposed at selected positions<br>
along the streamer 10 where motion of the cleaning device 12 is to be stopped or<br>
reversed during ordinary operation. The stops 11 are configured to cooperatively act<br>
with certain features, to be explained further below with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 to<br>
cause motion of the cleaning device 12 to reverse along the streamer 10.<br>
[0018]	One embodiment of an automatic streamer cleaning device is shown in<br>
various perspective views in FIGS. 2 through 5. In each of FIGS. 2 through 5, some<br>
of the components may not be shown that are shown in others of the figures to better<br>
illustrate those components that would be obscured by the components not shown<br>
because of the perspective of the illustration. However, FIGS. 2 through 5 show the<br>
same embodiment.<br>
[0019]	FIG. 2 shows a plan or top view of principal components of the present<br>
embodiment of a streamer cleaning device 12. The embodiment shown in FIG. 2 can<br>
be substantially symmetric about a center line 29 of the cleaning device 12, and thus<br>
all the components described with respect to one side of the center line 29 may have<br>
identical counterparts symmetrically disposed on the other side of the center line 29.<br>
As will be further explained below, the two symmetric parts of the cleaning device 12<br>
may be pivotally closed over the streamer to affix the cleaning device 12 to the<br>
streamer (10 in FIG. 1).<br>
 <br>
[0020]	A drive shaft support frame 34 rotatably supports a plurality of drive shafts<br>
32. An aftmost one of the drive shafts 32 is rotationally coupled to a turbine 30. In<br>
the most general sense, the turbine 30 converts energy of motion of the cleaning<br>
device through the water into motive power to drive the cleaning device 12 along the<br>
streamer. The turbine 30 in the present embodiment converts motion of the water, as<br>
the streamer with the cleaning device 12 attached thereto is moved through the water,<br>
to rotational motion imparted to the respective drive shaft 32. The turbine 30 may be<br>
surrounded by a guard 30A to reduce the possibility of turbine damage from the<br>
turbine 30 coming into contact with foreign objects. Others of the drive shafts 32, as<br>
shown in FIG. 2, can be rotationally coupled through cooperatively arranged pairs of<br>
bevel gears 36 to rotate a rotary cleaning element 38. The rotary cleaning element 38<br>
can be rotatably supported by the driveshaft support frame 34. The rotary cleaning<br>
element 38 may be a bristle brush, a scraper or any other device that can clean the<br>
exterior of the streamer. In the present embodiment, rotational motion of the turbine<br>
30 is ultimately converted to rotational motion of the rotary cleaning element 38.<br>
[0021]	Others of the drive shafts 32 may be arranged, through corresponding pairs<br>
of bevel gears 36 to rotate a tractor drive wheel 40. The tractor drive wheel 40 is in<br>
frictional contact on its exterior surface with a tractor drive belt 42. The tractor drive<br>
belt 42 can be cooperatively arranged as shown in FIG. 2 with both the tractor drive<br>
wheel 40 and a tractor idler wheel 44. The tractor drive wheel 40 and the tractor idler<br>
wheel 44 define the ends of the path of travel of the tractor drive belt 42. The tractor<br>
drive belt 42 is placed in frictional contact with one side of the exterior of the<br>
streamer (see 10 in FIG. 5). As may be inferred from the foregoing description and<br>
what is shown in FIG. 2, corresponding, symmetric structures to the foregoing may<br>
exist on the other side of the center line 29, such that when the cleaning device 12 is<br>
affixed the to the streamer, two opposed tractor drive belts 42 are in frictional contact<br>
with the exterior of the streamer.<br>
[0022]	As explained above, the components on one side of the center line 29 may be<br>
replicated symmetrically on the other side of the center line 29. Thus, as the turbines<br>
30 cause respective drive shafts 32 to rotate the respective tractor drive wheels 40, the<br>
tractor drive belts 42 are caused to move, thus moving the cleaning device 12 along<br>
the exterior of the streamer 10. The drive direction can be the same as that provided<br>
 <br>
by the rotary cleaning elements 38, such that the rotary cleaning elements 38 can<br>
assist in moving the cleaning device 12 along the streamer. It is contemplated that the<br>
respective tractor idler wheels 44 will be located at a sufficient longitudinal distance<br>
from the corresponding tractor drive wheel 40 so that the tractor drive belt 42 will<br>
traverse a length of the streamer sufficient to frictionally drive the cleaning device 12<br>
along the streamer without the need to undue clamping force between the two drive<br>
belts 42.<br>
[0023J	The tractor idler wheels 44 may also be arranged, using drive belts 47 or<br>
other driving arrangement, to rotate additional tractor idler wheels 46. The additional<br>
tractor idler wheels 46 are provided in the present embodiment to improve frictional<br>
contact between the drive belts 42 and the streamer. The tractor drive wheel 40,<br>
tractor idler wheel 44 and additional tractor idler wheels 46 can all by rotatably<br>
mounted on a tractor frame 45. The tractor frame 45 may be coupled directly or<br>
through additional structures to the driveshaft support frame 34.<br>
[0024]	A side view of the cleaning device 12 as in FIG. 3 shows a hinged housing<br>
48 that joins the two symmetrically disposed parts of the cleaning device 12 (on either<br>
side of the center line 29), particularly including the driveshaft support frames 34, so<br>
as to be removably affixed to the streamer. The cleaning device 12 may be affixed to<br>
and removed from the streamer by a user moving a handle 50 arranged to pivotally<br>
move one side of the housing 48 away from the other. An arrangement of such a<br>
pivot is shown at 49 in FIG. 5. The housing 48 may be an open framework as shown<br>
in FIGS. 2 through 5. The function performed by the housing 48 in the present<br>
embodiment is to removably affix the cleaning device 12 to the streamer. It is within<br>
the scope of this invention for the housing 48 to exclude pivot features such as shown<br>
in FIG. 3 and FIG. 5, such that affixing and removing the cleaning device 12 from the<br>
streamer would require moving an end of the streamer through the cleaning device 12.<br>
[0025]	The housing 48 shown in FIGS. 2 through 5 may be an open framework. In<br>
other embodiments, the housing may also be in the form of an enclosure shaped to<br>
reduce drag in the water, wherein the functional components explained above are<br>
substantially enclosed in the housing. As used in the present description, the term<br>
housing is intended to encompass both an enclosure and an open frame, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
 <br>
[0026]	An oblique view of the cleaning device 12 in FIG. 4 shows the relative<br>
placement of the above described components.<br>
[0027]	Another example of a mechanism to enable affixing and removing the<br>
cleaning device 12 from a streamer is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. FIGS. 8 and 9 show,<br>
respectively, the cleaning device 12 in its closed or affixed position and in its open<br>
position. In FIG. 8, the housing 48 is shown in the form of a rectangular block<br>
extending along the longitudinal dimension of the cleaning device 12, such dimension<br>
being essentially parallel to the streamer. The housing 48 disposed on each side of the<br>
streamer has inserted in an upper (or lower) surface thereof one side of a generally U-<br>
shaped a pivot 49A. The pivot 49A shown in FIG. 8 can be disposed generally<br>
toward one longitudinal end of the cleaning device 12. Another such pivot (see FIG.<br>
9) can be disposed at the aft end of the housing 48. Each leg or side of the pivot 49A<br>
is cooperatively arranged with a respective housing 48 so that the pivot 49A can rotate<br>
in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension of the respective housing<br>
48. As shown in FIG. 8, when the cleaning device 12 is affixed to the streamer (not<br>
shown in FIG. 8), the pivot 49A is arranged such that one side thereof is at a different<br>
longitudinal position along the cleaning device 12 than on the side. The<br>
corresponding pivot (see FIG. 9) disposed generally toward the other longitudinal end<br>
of the cleaning device 12 can be arranged such that each side thereof has the same<br>
relative longitudinal relationship as the pivot 49A shown in FIG. 8.<br>
[0028]	The handle 50 may be coupled to the pivot 49A shown in FIG. 8 such that<br>
rotation of the handle 50 in a plane generally perpendicular to the rotation of the two<br>
sides of the pivot 49A causes the pivot 49A to rotate relative to the two housings 48.<br>
Because of the longitudinal relationship of the two sides of the pivot 49A, when the<br>
pivot 49A is rotated by the handle 50, the orientation of the pivot 49A with respect to<br>
each of the two housings 48 is changed such that the lateral distance between the<br>
housings is changed. Thus, when the handle 50 is rotated in one direction, the<br>
corresponding rotation of the pivot 49A causes the housings 48 to separate laterally.<br>
[0029]	Referring to FIG. 9, the other of the two pivots 49A not previously shown in<br>
FIG. 8 can be observed. By suitably placing the two pivots 49A along the<br>
longitudinal dimension of the housings 48 as explained above, the two housings 48<br>
may be caused to move in a parallelogram manner. Thus, when the handle 50 is<br>
 <br>
WO 2008/068622<br>
 <br>
PCT/IB2007/004300<br>
 <br>
rotated to the position shown in FIG. 9, the two housings 48 may be laterally<br>
separated by a similar amount at each longitudinal end, so as to enable removing the<br>
cleaning device 12 from the streamer.<br>
[0030]	It will be appreciated by those skilled in the at that once the cleaning device<br>
12 reaches the end of its travel along a streamer, it will be.necessary to reverse the<br>
direction of movement to maintain automatic operation. A mechanism that can<br>
provide automatic reversal of direction is shown schematically in FIG. 6. One of the<br>
turbines 30 is shown in FIG. 6 coupled to its respective drive shaft 32. In the present<br>
embodiment, the turbine blades 31 are mounted in a turbine hub 30B such that their<br>
pitch may be changed. Changeable pitch may be attained in some embodiments by<br>
mounting the blades 31 in the hub 30B so that the blades 31 may be rotated about<br>
their respective mounting axes in the hub 30B. In principle, such mounting is similar<br>
to the mounting of helicopter rotor blades such that the blade pitch can be controlled.<br>
Actual rotation of each blade 31 about its respective mounting axis may be performed<br>
by a link 80 affixed at one end to each blade such that motion along the longitudinal<br>
dimension of the cleaning device will rotate the blades 31 accordingly. Each blade 31<br>
will have a respective link 80. The links 80 may all terminate at their other ends in a<br>
pitch rotator plate 82 disposed around the drive shaft 32. The pitch rotator plate 82<br>
thus rotates coaxially with the turbine 30. A pitch adjuster thrust plate 84 is coupled<br>
to the pitch rotator plate through a bearing 86 such that the pitch adjuster thrust plate<br>
84 may remain rotationally fixed, while the pitch rotator plate 82 is free to rotate with<br>
the turbine 30. Longitudinal motion of the pitch adjuster thrust plate 84, however, is<br>
directly transferred to the pitch rotator plate 82. The pitch adjuster thrust plate 84<br>
may be coupled through a link 88 to a direction reversing arm 90. The direction<br>
reversing arm 90 may be slidably supported in linear bearings 92 mounted on the<br>
frame (34 in FIG. 2). A contact 94A, 94B may be disposed at each end of the<br>
direction reversing arm 90.<br>
[0031]	When the cleaning device 12 reaches the end of its travel in one direction<br>
along the streamer, the one of the contacts 94A, 94B closest to the respective end of<br>
the streamer may com into contact with a stop (11 in FIG. 1) positioned on the<br>
streamer. When the respective one of the contacts 94A, 94B strikes the respective<br>
stop (11 in FIG. 1) the direction reversing arm 90 is moved. Such motion is<br>
9<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
PCT/IB2007/004300<br>
 <br>
transferred to the pitch adjuster thrust plate 84 by the link 88, and thus ultimately<br>
causes the turbine blade pitch to change. Such blade pitch change may cause the<br>
rotation direction of the turbine 30 to reverse. By reversing the rotation direction of<br>
the turbine 30, the movement of the cleaning device will also be reversed.<br>
[0032J	As the cleaning device now moves in the opposite direction along the<br>
streamer, and eventually reaches the other stop (11 in FIG. 1), the other of the<br>
contacts 94A, 94B will strike the other stop, and thus once again change the turbine<br>
blade pitch so as to reverse rotation of the turbine 30. Thus, the cleaning device 12<br>
may travel from end to end of the streamer with no required operator intervention.<br>
[0033]	The elements shown in FIG. 6 are disposed on one side of the center line (29<br>
in FIG. 2) of the cleaning device 12. As explained above with reference to FIGS. 2<br>
through 5, symmetrically placed, substantially identical components may be disposed<br>
on the other side of the center line (29 in FIG. 2).<br>
[0034]	It will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that by appropriate<br>
selection of turbine 30 parameters, such as blade diameter, numbers of blade and pitch<br>
of the blades, enough rotational energy can be generated by movement of the cleaning<br>
device 12 through the water to move the cleaning device 12 in a direction toward the<br>
front of the streamer (toward the seismic vessel).<br>
[0035]	An alternative embodiment of a streamer cleaning device is shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 7, that does not require changing turbine blade pitch to change<br>
direction of movement of the cleaning device. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7,<br>
the turbines 30 each can drive a respective electric generator or alternator 50. Electric<br>
power generated by the respective generators 50 may be used to operate a respective<br>
controller 52 and electric motor 54. Each electric motor 54 may be arranged to rotate<br>
one of the tractor wheels (either drive wheel 40 or idler wheel 44). The direction of<br>
rotation of each motor 54 may be selected by the respective controller 52. Each<br>
controller 52 may be in signal communication with any form of proximity detector,<br>
switch or other device 56 that signals to the respective controller 52 that the end of<br>
travel of the cleaning device 12 in one direction is reached. Upon such signal, the<br>
controllers 52 will operate their respective motors 54 in the opposite direction of<br>
rotation to reverse direction of motion of the cleaning device 12 along the streamer.<br>

[0036]	Still other embodiments may include a reversible gear set coupled between<br>
the respective turbines 30 and the tractor wheels.<br>
[0037]	While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate<br>
that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the<br>
invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be<br>
limited only by the attached claims.<br>
