				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PHASE-CHANGE TYPE OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND<br>
REPRODUCTION METHOD AND APPARATUS OF SUCH A RECORDING<br>
MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to<br>
phase-change type optical recording media and, more<br>
particularly, to a phase-change type optical recording<br>
medium for high-density recording such as a rewritable<br>
digital versatile disc (DVD) having a phase-change type<br>
optical recording layer, and a reproduction method and<br>
apparatus of the phase-change type optical recording<br>
medium.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, in a compact disc (CD) and a<br>
digital versatile disc (DVD), binary signals are<br>
recorded and tracking signals are detected by using a<br>
change in a reflectance that is generated by<br>
interference between lights from a bottom of a recessed<br>
pit and a mirror surface portion. In recent years, a<br>
phase-change type rewritable compact disc (CD-RW: CD-<br>
Rewritable) has become widely used. Additionally,<br><br>
various kinds of phase-change type rewritable DVD have<br>
also been suggested. Further, while a capacity of a DVD<br>
is 4.7 GB, a system high-density BD has been suggested,<br>
which has a capacity of more than 20 GB by reducing a<br>
recording and reproduction wavelength to 350 nm to 420<br>
nm and increasing a numerical aperture NA (for example,<br>
refer to Non-Patent Document 1). Additionally, in a<br>
DVD-R, dual-layer media have been suggested and a<br>
recording or reproduction apparatus compliant with the<br>
dual-layer media has been achieved.<br>
In the phase-change type rewritable CD, DVD<br>
and BD, recording information signals are detected by<br>
using a reflectance change and a phase-difference change<br>
generated by a difference in refractive index between an<br>
amorphous state and a crystal state. A normal phase-<br>
change type recording medium has a structure in which a<br>
lower protective layer, a phase-change type recording<br>
layer, an upper protective layer and a reflection layer<br>
are provided on a substrate. The reflectance difference<br>
and the refractive index difference are controlled by<br>
utilizing multiple interaction of those layers so as to<br>
give compatibility with a CD or a DVD. In a CD-RW, a<br>
compatibility of recording signals and groove signals<br>
with a CD can be acquired within a range of a<br>
reflectance reduced to 15% to 25%. Accordingly,<br><br>
reproduction can be made by using a CD drive having an<br>
amplification system that covers a low reflectance. It<br>
should be noted that in the phase-change type optical<br>
recording medium, erasure and rerecording can be<br>
performed by intensity modulation of a single convergent<br>
light beam. Thus, in a phase-change type optical<br>
recording medium such as a CD-RW or a rewritable DVD,<br>
recording may include overwriting (O/W) that<br>
simultaneously performs recording and erasure in many<br>
cases.<br>
As for recording information using a phase<br>
change, a crystal, an amorphous or a mixture of those<br>
can be used, and also a plurality of crystal phases can<br>
be used. In the phase-change type optical recording<br>
media materialized at present, it is general that an<br>
unrecorded or erasure state is made into a crystal state<br>
and recording is made by forming marks of an amorphous<br>
state.<br>
As a material of a phase-change type recording<br>
layer, a chalcogen element, i.e., a chalcogenide based<br>
alloy containing S, Se and Te is used in many cases.<br>
For example, they are a GeSbTe system containing a GeTe-<br>
Sb2Te3 pseudo binary alloy as a major component, an<br>
InSbTe system containing an InTe-Sb2Te3 pseudo binary<br>
alloy as a major component, an AglnSbTe system<br><br>
containing a Sb0.7Te0.3 eutectic alloy as a major<br>
component, a GeSbTe system, etc. Among those, a system<br>
in which superfluous Sb is added to the GeTe-Sb2Te3<br>
pseudo binary alloy, especially an intermetallic<br>
compound neighborhood composition such as Ge1Sb2Te4 or<br>
Ge2Sb2Te5 is mainly put into practice. Those<br>
compositions features crystallization without phase<br>
separation that is peculiar to an intermetallic compound,<br>
and is easily initialized since a crystal growth rate is<br>
large and a recrystallization rate is large during<br>
erasure. Thus, conventionally, as a recording layer<br>
exhibiting a practical O/W characteristic, a pseudo<br>
binary alloy system and an intermetallic compound<br>
neighborhood composition attracted attention (for<br>
example, refer to Non-Patent Document 2).<br>
Moreover, conventionally, reports are made<br>
regarding a recording layer composition, which is a<br>
GeSbTe ternary composition or the ternary composition as<br>
a matrix containing an additive element (for example,<br>
refer to Patent Documents 1-4).<br>
However, a material and a phase composition<br>
dealing with the dual-layer media of a DVD-RW is in<br>
future development, and there are many problems in<br>
applying such a material and phase composition to an<br>
optical recording medium for high-density recording such<br><br>
as a rewritable BD.<br>
There is suggested as a heat resistant<br>
protective layer material a metal oxide such as ZnO or<br>
ZrO, a carbide such as TiC or a mixture of the<br>
aforementioned. However, there is no effect of<br>
satisfying a recording and reproduction characteristic<br>
in sulfide resistance while acquiring storage stability<br>
(for example, refer to Patent Document 5).<br>
Moreover, there is suggested a single<br>
recording layer with a layer having a triple layer<br>
composition of ZnS.SiO2/AlN/ZnS. SiO2 provided between the<br>
recording layer and a substrate (for example, refer to<br>
Non-Patent Document 3).<br>
However, a total thickness of the layer cannot<br>
be reduced after all.<br>
Moreover, the applicant suggested a phase-<br>
change type optical recording medium having a single<br>
recording layer structure in which a first recording<br>
composition layer, a resin intermediate layer and a<br>
second recording layer provided on a substrate in that<br>
order (refer to Patent Document 6). The first recording<br>
composition layer consists of a heat release layer, a<br>
first interface layer, a first protective layer, a first<br>
recording layer and a second protective layer in that<br>
order from a substrate side. The second recording<br><br>
composition layer consists of a heat release layer, a<br>
second interface layer, a fourth protective layer, a<br>
second recording layer and a fifth protective layer in<br>
that order from the resin intermediate layer side.<br>
Moreover, there is suggested an optical<br>
information medium having a first recording stack layer<br>
and a second recording stack layer provided in that<br>
order on one side of a substrate (for example, refer to<br>
Patent Document 7). In this optical information medium,<br>
the first recording stack layer consists of a recording<br>
layer sandwiched between two dielectric material layers,<br>
a transparent metal layer, and a further dielectric<br>
layer on a side opposite to a side on which a laser<br>
light beam is incident. The second recording stack<br>
layer consists of a transparent spacer layer, a phase-<br>
change type recording sandwiched between two dielectric<br>
material layers, and a metal mirror layer on a side<br>
opposite to a side on which the laser light beam is<br>
incident. In this case, the first recording stack layer<br>
has a thickness of 10 ran to 30 ran, and the metal layer<br>
of the first recording stack layer is made of silver.<br>
Moreover, the two recording layers are made of<br>
recordable material, and both layers are sandwiched by<br>
protective layers. Further, the thickness of the metal<br>
layer is less than 10 nm and equal to or more than 2 nm.<br><br>

US 2004/076908 does not teach or suggest the feature, viz., that each of the recording<br>
layers contains a composition of Ge, Ag, Sb and Te in which the amount of Ge is 3 to 5<br>
atomic %, and the amount of Ag is equal to or less than 8 atoms %.<br>
US 7009930 does not disclose setting a start position of a focusing operation of an<br>
objective lens of an optical pickup device so that a focal point of a light beam outgoing<br>
from the objective lens is beyond a first recording structure layer.<br><br>
However, although the above-mentioned phase-<br>
change type optical recording media are easily<br>
recordable with a short wavelength such as a blue laser<br>
since the material absorbs a large amount of light of a<br>
short wavelength, it is difficult to record the media<br><br>
with a red wavelength since the material absorbs only a<br>
small amount of light of the red wavelength. Thus, in a<br>
medium having a single recording layer, a thick<br>
reflection layer is provided so as to prevent a light<br>
from transmitting therethrough so that the media is<br>
easily recordable.<br>
However, in a case where two recording layers<br>
are provided, multi-layer recording cannot be performed<br>
unless the first recording layer on the side where a<br>
light is incident transmits about a half amount of the<br>
light. Thus, if the first recording layer is made to<br>
transmit the light therethrough, the first layer cannot<br>
absorb a sufficient amount of light and it is difficult<br>
to achieve recording. Since a red wavelength LD is<br>
capable of emitting a light with a high power, one time<br>
recording can be performed by applying a high power to<br>
the medium. However, it is difficult to maintain an<br>
overwrite (0/W) characteristic since the film tends to<br>
be deteriorated by the high power being applied.<br>
Additionally, if a recording sensitivity is raised so as<br>
to be easily overwritten, there is a problem that<br>
reliability with respect to temperature and humidity is<br>
deteriorated.<br>
In the meantime, DVDs currently on the market<br>
are classified into a DVD (containing a dual-layer<br><br>
structure) that is exclusive for reproduction, a DVD±R<br>
(containing a dual-layer structure) that is recordable,<br>
and a DVD±RW (only a single layer structure) containing<br>
dual-layer structure) that is rewritable. Any of those<br>
DVDs can be reproduced by a DVD video recorder or a DVD<br>
player. However, presently, the rewritable DVD±RW is<br>
materialized with only a single layer structure, and<br>
recording time is about a half of that of a dual-layer<br>
structure, which raises a problem in that long time<br>
recording cannot be made. Thus, it is desirous to<br>
develop a DVD+RW, which is rewritable and permits long<br>
time recording.<br>
However, a reflectance of a dual-layer<br>
structure DVD+RW is only about one-third of that of a<br>
recordable dual-layer structure DVD+R. Accordingly, the<br>
dual-layer structure DVD±RW cannot be reproduced by a<br>
present DVD video recorder or a DVD player. Thus, it is<br>
necessary to devise in an information reproducing method<br>
including a composition of a DVD.<br>
In an optical disc apparatus technique, a<br>
focus error signal (FE) and a track error signal (TE)<br>
are normalized so as to perform a focus servo and a<br>
track servo, and a technique for normalization is<br>
suggested (for example, refer to Patent Document 8).<br>
Specifically, Patent Document 8 discloses that a<br><br>
summation signal from a divided light-receiving element<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as PU) of an optical pickup<br>
device is used as an original signal for normalizing a<br>
servo signal such as a focus signal, a track signal, etc.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an automatic gain control (AGC)<br>
circuit used in a conventional optical disc apparatus.<br>
In the AGC circuit, a plurality of signals VA, VB, VC<br>
and VD from a PU are operated by a focus error (FE)<br>
arithmetic circuit 101 to calculate FE=(A+C)-(B+D) and a<br>
track error (TE) arithmetic circuit 102 to calculate<br>
TE=(B+C)-(A+D). Additionally, SUM=(A+B+C+D) is<br>
calculated by a SUM arithmetic circuit 103. A<br>
normalization circuit comprises an AGCCNT circuit 104<br>
and voltage control amplifiers (VCAs) 105. A gain of<br>
each VCA 105 is set by the AGCCNT circuit 104 so that a<br>
level of a SUM signal from the SUM arithmetic circuit<br>
103 input to the AGCCNT circuit 104 is a constant<br>
voltage. Specifically, for example, if it is set so<br>
that the level of the SUM signal is 1 V, the gain of<br>
each VCA 105 becomes equal to 1 (GAIN=1/SUM).<br>
At this time, an AGC operation of the FE<br>
signal and the TE signal is carried out as follows.<br>
FEn=[(A+C)-(B+D)]/(A+B+C+D)<br>
TEn=[ (B+C)-(A+D) ]/(A+B+C+D)<br>
It is quite difficult to enlarge an AGC gain<br><br>
range in each VCA 105, and about ±10 dB is appropriate.<br>
Since the AGC amplifier is used for a servo signal, an<br>
input offset cannot be fluctuated with respect to a gain<br>
fluctuation. That is, an extremely small fluctuation is<br>
required for a large gain range.<br>
Patent Document 8: Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application No. 2001-101680<br>
Therefore, in the conventional optical disc<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 1, in order to take a large<br>
range of the gain and to also reduce a fluctuation of an<br>
offset, a circuit scale must be enlarged and there is a<br>
problem that realization is difficult. Moreover,<br>
although an input offset and an AGC gain error are small<br>
at the center of the AGC range, the input offset and the<br>
AGC gain error become large at the end of the AGC range.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A description will now be given of embodiments<br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is an illustration of a cross section<br>
of a layer structure of a phase-change type optical<br>
recording medium according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the phase-change type<br>
optical recording medium according to the present<br>
embodiment comprises a substrate 1, a reflective layer 2,<br>
a first protective layer 3, a first recording layer 4, a<br>
second protective layer 5, a resin intermediate layer 6,<br>
a third protective layer 7, a heat release layer 8 made<br>
of a Cu or Cu alloy layer, a fourth protective layer 9,<br>
a second recording layer 10, a fifth protective layer 11,<br>
and a cover substrate 12.<br>
As the material of the substrate 1, a<br>
transparent resin such as polycarbonate, acrylic resin<br>
or polyolefin or a transparent glass may be used. Among<br>
those materials, the polycarbonate resin is most widely<br>
used for forming a compact disc (CD) especially, and is<br>
a most preferable material since it is inexpensive. In<br>
a case of a DVD, a groove of a pitch of 0.74 µm is<br>
provided normally in the substrate. Such a groove is<br>
not always required to have a cross section in<br>
geometrically square shape or trapezoidal shape. For<br>
example, such a groove may be formed optically by<br>
forming a wave-guide path having different refraction<br><br>
indexes by, for example, ion injection.<br>
As a desirable phase-change type recording<br>
material used for the first and second recording layers<br>
4 and 10, there are alloys containing Sb and Te as major<br>
components. Among those, an alloy containing Ge, Sb and<br>
Te as constituent elements is preferable. Each<br>
recording layer containing those constituent elements<br>
may be added with other elements, if necessary, by total<br>
of 10 atomic %. Moreover, the optical constant of the<br>
recording layer can be finely adjusted by adding at<br>
least one element selected from a group consisting of 0,<br>
N and S by 0.1 to 5 atomic %. However, if the additive<br>
exceeds 5 atomic %, a crystallization rate is decreased,<br>
which is not preferable since it deteriorates an erasure<br>
performance.<br>
Moreover, in order to improve a stability over<br>
time without decreasing the crystallization rate during<br>
overwrite (0/W), at least one element selected from a<br>
group consisting of V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Co, Pt and Zr is<br>
preferably added by 8 atomic % or less, and more<br>
preferably, by 0.1 to 5 atomic %. It is preferable that<br>
a total amount of additives of those elements and Ge is<br>
equal to or less than 15 atomic % with respect to SbTe.<br>
If it exceeds 15 atomic %, it may induce a phase<br>
separation of components other than Sb. Especially, the<br><br>
effect of additives is large when Ge content is 3 to 5<br>
atomic %.<br>
Moreover, in order to improve the stability<br>
over time and finely adjust a refractive index, it is<br>
preferable to add at least one element selected from a<br>
group consisting of Si, Sn and Pb by equal to or less<br>
than 5 atomic %. It is preferable that the total amount<br>
of additives of those elements and Ge is equal to or<br>
less tan 15 atomic %. It should be noted that Si, Sn,<br>
and Pb are the elements which have a four-configuration<br>
network as well as Ge.<br>
Moreover, a crystallization temperature can be<br>
increased while reducing jitter and improving recording<br>
sensitivity by adding at least one element selected from<br>
a group consisting of Al, Ga and In by equal to or less<br>
than 8 atomic %, and preferably 6 atomic % since<br>
segregation tends to occur. It is preferable that a<br>
total amount of those elements and Ge is equal to or<br>
less than 15 atomic %, and more preferably, equal to or<br>
less than 13 atomic %.<br>
Moreover, if Ag is added by an amount equal to<br>
or less than 8 atomic %, there is an effect of improving<br>
recording sensitivity, and the effect is remarkable if<br>
an amount of added Ge exceeds 5 atomic %. However, if<br>
the amount of Ag exceeds 8 atomic %, it is not<br><br>
preferable since jitter may be increased or stability of<br>
amorphous mark is deteriorated. Additionally, if a<br>
total amount of Ag and Ge exceeds 15 atomic %, it is not<br>
preferable since segregation tends to occur. An<br>
especially preferable amount of Ag added is 5 atomic %.<br>
The first and second recording layers 4 and 10<br>
are phase-change type recording layers, and, generally a<br>
thickness thereof is preferably in a range of 5 to 100<br>
nm. If the thickness is smaller than 5 nm, it is<br>
difficult to acquire a sufficient contrast and a<br>
crystallization rate tends to decrease, which makes it<br>
difficult to perform erasure within a short time. On<br>
the other hand, if the thickness exceeds 100 nm, it is<br>
also difficult to acquire optical contrast and a crack<br>
tends to occur. It is required for a contrast to be<br>
compatible with a reproduction only disc such as a DVD.<br>
Moreover, in high-density recording in which a<br>
shortest mark length is equal to or smaller than 0.5 µm,<br>
it is preferable that the thickness of the first and<br>
second recording layers is 5 to 25 nm. If the thickness<br>
is smaller than 5 nm, it is not preferable since a<br>
reflectance is too low, and ununiform composition in<br>
initial film growth and influences of a nondense film<br>
tend to appear. On the other hand, if the thickness is<br>
larger than 25 nm, a heat capacity is large and<br><br>
recording sensitivity is deteriorated, and an edge of an<br>
amorphous mark is disturbed and jitter tends to increase<br>
due to three-dimensional crystal growth. Further, a<br>
volume change due to phase change of the first and<br>
second recording layers is remarkable, which is not<br>
preferable since repeated overwrite (O/W) resistance is<br>
deteriorated. In a viewpoint of jitter of a mark edge<br>
and repeated overwrite resistance, the thickness is<br>
preferably equal to or smaller than 20 nm.<br>
The density of the first and second recording<br>
layers 4 and 10 is equal to or greater than 80% of a<br>
bulk density, and preferably be equal to or greater than<br>
90%. In order to increase the density in a sputtering<br>
film deposition method, it is required to increase an<br>
amount of high-energy Ar irradiated onto the recording<br>
layer by decreasing a pressure of a sputter gas (rare<br>
gas such as Ar) during film deposition or placing a<br>
substrate close to a front of a target.<br>
The high-energy Ar is one of Ar ions<br>
irradiated onto a target for sputtering and bouncing and<br>
reaching the substrate side and Ar ions in plasma being<br>
accelerated by a sheath voltage at an entire surface of<br>
a substrate and reaching the substrate. Such an<br>
irradiation effect of a high-energy rare gas is referred<br>
to as atomic peening effect. In a sputter in Ar gas<br><br>
which is used generally, Ar gas is mixed into a sputter<br>
film due to the atomic peening effect. The atomic<br>
peenig effect can be estimated according to an amount of<br>
Ar mixed into the film. That is, if the amount of Ar is<br>
small, it means that the high-energy Ar irradiation<br>
effect is small and a nondense film tends to be formed.<br>
On the other hand, if the amount of Ar is too much,<br>
irradiation of high-energy Ar is strong, which causes<br>
generation of voids due to release of Ar, which is taken<br>
into the film, during repeated overwrite (O/W) and<br>
causes the repeat resistance to be deteriorated. An<br>
appropriate amount of Ar in the recording layer film is<br>
0.1 to 1.5 atomic %. Further, it is preferable to use<br>
high-frequency sputtering rather than direct current<br>
sputtering since it reduces an amount of Ar in the film<br>
and a high-density film is obtained.<br>
Additionally, the first and second recording<br>
layers 4 and 10 after film deposition is normally in an<br>
amorphous state. Accordingly, it is needed to<br>
crystallize each entire recording layer after the film<br>
deposition to be in an initialized state (unrecorded<br>
state). As for the initialization method,<br>
initialization by annealing in a solid phase may be<br>
taken, but it is preferable to initialize by so-called<br>
melt-recrystallization which melts a recording layer and<br><br>
gradually cools to solidify the recording layer to be<br>
crystallized. The above-mentioned each recording layer<br>
has little crystal nucleus immediately after film<br>
deposition and it is difficult to crystallize in a solid<br>
phase. However, according to the melt-recrystallization,<br>
by melting after small number of crystal nucleus is<br>
formed, recrystallization progresses rapidly with<br>
crystal growth as a main.<br>
Since the reflectance is different between the<br>
crystal according to the melt-recrystallization and<br>
crystal according to annealing in a solid phase, mixture<br>
of them may cause noise. In practical 0/W recording, an<br>
erased portion becomes crystal due to melt-<br>
recrystallization, and, thus, it is preferable to also<br>
perform initialization according to melt-<br>
recrystallization.<br>
When performing initialization according to<br>
melt-recrystallization, it is recommended to melt a<br>
recording layer locally and within a short time such as<br>
1 msec or less. This is for the reason that if a melted<br>
area is large or a melting time or a cooling time is too<br>
long, each layer may be destroyed or a plastic substrate<br>
surface may be deformed due to heat. In order to give<br>
heat history appropriate for initialization, it is<br>
preferable to irradiate a high-output semiconductor<br><br>
laser light with a wavelength of about 600 to 1000 nm by<br>
converging the light in an ellipse form having a longer<br>
axis of 100 to 300 µm and a shorter axis of 1 to 3 µm<br>
and scans the light at a linear velocity of 1 to 10<br>
m/sec along the direction of the shorter axis as a<br>
scanning axis. With the same converged light, a melted<br>
area is too large and recrystallization tends to occur<br>
if it is close to a circular form, and, thus, it is not<br>
preferable since there may be a large damage given to a<br>
multi-layer structure or a substrate.<br>
The fact that the initialization was performed<br>
according to melt-rerystallization can be checked as<br>
follows. Namely, a recording light having a recording<br>
power Pw, which is converged into a spot diameter<br>
smaller than about 1.5 µm and is sufficient for melting<br>
a recording layer, onto a medium after initialization<br>
linearly at a constant velocity. If there exists a<br>
guiding groove, it is performed while tracking servo or<br>
a focus servo is applied to a track formed by the groove<br>
or a portion between the grooves.<br>
Thereafter, if the reflectance of the erasure<br>
state acquired on the same track by irradiating an<br>
erasure light of an erasure power Pe (≤Pw) in direct<br>
current is completely the same as the reflectance in the<br>
unrecorded initialized state, it can be confirmed that<br><br>
the initialized state is the melt-recrystallized state.<br>
This is because the recording layer was once melted by<br>
the recording light irradiation and the state where the<br>
thus-melted recording layer is completely recrystallized<br>
by the erasure light irradiation is the result of<br>
melting by the recording light and recrystallization by<br>
the erasure light, which is the state of melt-<br>
recrystallization. The fact that a reflectance Rini in<br>
the initialized state and a reflectance Rcry in the<br>
melt-recrystallized state are the same means that a<br>
difference between the reflectance Rini and Rcry defined<br>
by (Rini-Rcry)/{(Rini+Rcry )/2} is equal to or less than<br>
0.2 (that is, 20% or less). Normally, the difference in<br>
reflectance is greater than 20% when only solid<br>
crystallization such as annealing is performed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the first recording layer<br>
4 is provided between the first protective layer 3 and<br>
the second protective layer 5, and the second recording<br>
layer 10 is provided between the fourth protective layer<br>
9 and the fifth protective layer 11. A description will<br>
be given below of the first, second fourth and fifth<br>
protective layers that sandwich the recording layers.<br>
The first protective layer 3 and the fourth<br>
recording layer 9 have a function to efficiently release<br>
heat to the reflective layer or the Cu or Cu alloy layer.<br><br>
On the other hand, the second protective layer 5 is<br>
mainly effective for preventing deformation of a surface<br>
of the resin intermediate layer due to a high<br>
temperature during recording. The fifth protective<br>
layer 11 is effective for adjusting a reflectance and<br>
preventing deformation of the cover substrate<br>
The material of the first, second, fourth and<br>
fifth protective layers 3, 5, 9 and 11 is determined in<br>
consideration of a refractive index, a thermal<br>
conductivity, a chemical stability, a mechanical<br>
strength, an adhesion nature, etc. It is better that<br>
the material has a low thermal conductivity, which level<br>
is 1X10-3pJ/(µm.N.nsec) . It should be noted that it is<br>
difficult to directly measure the thermal conductivity<br>
of such a low thermal conductivity material in a thin<br>
film state. Instead of direct measurement, a rough<br>
value can be obtained by a thermal simulation and a<br>
result of measurement of an actual recording sensitivity.<br>
As the above-mentioned low thermal<br>
conductivity material, which brings a preferable result,<br>
for the second protective layer 5 and the fifth<br>
protective layer 11, there is a composite dielectric<br>
material containing at least one selected from a group<br>
consisting of ZnS, ZnO, TaS2 and a rare earth sulfide by<br>
50 to 90 moll % and also containing a heat-resistant<br><br>
compound having a high-transparency and a melting point<br>
or a decomposition point equal to or higher than 1000oC.<br>
As a specific example of a rare earth sulfide, there is<br>
a composite dielectric material containing a rare earth<br>
sulfide such as La, Ce, Nd, Y, etc., by 60 to 90 moll %.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the rate of ZnS, ZnO,<br>
TaS2 or a rare earth sulfide is 70 to 90 moll %.<br>
As a heat-resistant compound having a melting<br>
point or a decomposition point of 1000oC or higher,<br>
there are an oxide, nitride or carbide of Mg, Ca, Sr, Y,<br>
La, Ce, Ho, Er, Yb, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Zn, Al, Si,<br>
Ge, Pb, etc., and a fluoride of Ca, Mg, Li, etc. It<br>
should be noted that the oxide, sulfide, nitride carbide<br>
and fluoride are not needed to take a stoichiometric<br>
composition, and it is effective to change a composition<br>
or mix them for controlling a refractive index.<br>
As a material of the first and fourth<br>
protective layers 3 and 9, a material having a thermal<br>
conductivity higher than that of the SnOx based second<br>
and fifth protective layers 5 and 11 may give a good<br>
recording characteristic. It is preferable that the<br>
first and fourth protective layers 3 and 9 do not<br>
contain S. Additionally, good reliability can be<br>
obtained if the layers contain TaOx or the like by 10<br>
moll % to 30 moll %.<br><br>
A description will now be given of a function<br>
of each of the above-mentioned protective layers.<br>
The layer structure according to the present<br>
invention is a kind of layer structure which is referred<br>
to as a rapid cooling structure. The rapid cooling<br>
structure achieves a high erasure ratio by high-rate<br>
crystallization while eliminating a problem of<br>
recrystallization when forming an amorphous mark by<br>
using a layer structure which promotes heat radiation<br>
and increases a cooling rate when a recording layer is<br>
resolidified.<br>
The film thickness of the fist and fourth<br>
protective layers 3 and 9 give a great influence to<br>
permanence in repeat overwrite (0/W), and it is<br>
important in suppressing deterioration of jitter. The<br>
film thickness is generally 5 to 30 nm. If the film<br>
thickness is smaller than 5 nm, it is not preferable<br>
since a delay effect of heat conductance at the<br>
protective layers 3 and 9 is not sufficient and<br>
recording sensitivity is decreased remarkably. If the<br>
film thickness is larger than 30 nm, a sufficient<br>
flattening effect of a temperature distribution in a<br>
direction of a mark width is not obtained. Besides, a<br>
temperature difference between a recording layer side<br>
and a reflective layer or a heat release layer side of<br><br>
each of the second and fifth protective layers 5 and 11<br>
tends to be deformable due to a difference in thermal<br>
expansion on both sides of the protective layer. The<br>
repetition causes accumulation of microscopic<br>
deformation in the protective layer and invites an<br>
increase in noise, which is not preferable.<br>
The film thickness of the first and fourth<br>
protective layers 3 and 9 is preferably 15 to 25 nm when<br>
the wavelength of the recording laser light is 600 to<br>
700 nm and 3 to 20 nm when the wavelength is 350 to 600<br>
nm, and more preferably 3 to 15 nm.<br>
Moreover, the film thickness of the second and<br>
fifth protective layers 5 and 11 must be 30 to 250 nm.<br>
If the film thickness is smaller than 30 nm, the layers<br>
can be easily destroyed by deformation when the<br>
recording layer is melted, which deteriorates the O/W<br>
characteristic.<br>
The present inventors considered and studied<br>
an appropriate layer structure of a phase-change type<br>
optical recording medium having a dual-layer recording<br>
structure to confirm to the above-mentioned requirements,<br>
and made a design to match recording sensitivities of<br>
the two layers by using Cu or a Cu alloy having a high<br>
transparency and a good heat radiation in the thickness<br>
of equal to or greater than 2 nm and smaller than 10 nm<br><br>
so that an optical transparency and heat radiation and a<br>
high recording sensitivity are obtained.<br>
In the high-density mark length modulation<br>
recording using the above-mentioned optical system, it<br>
is important to use a material having a low thermal<br>
conductivity for the first and fourth protective layers<br>
3 and 9, and the film thickness thereof is preferably 3<br>
to 20 nm.<br>
Additionally, since the light reaching the<br>
first recording structure layer 100 is a transparent<br>
light which has transmitted through the second recording<br>
structure layer 200, an amount of incident light is less<br>
than a half of that of the second recording structure<br>
layer 200. Accordingly, it is preferable that the<br>
amount of incident light on the second recording<br>
structure layer 200 is increased or the sensitivity of<br>
the first recording layer 4 of the first recording<br>
structure layer 100 is raised.<br>
In the present invention, in the first<br>
recording structure layer 100 having smaller amount of<br>
incident light, the first recording layer 4 is<br>
sandwiched between layers having a low thermal<br>
conductivity so as to raise recording sensitivity, and<br>
the film thickness of the first protective layer 3 is<br>
reduced to 3 to 20 nm so as to easily absorb heat, and,<br><br>
thereby, the recording sensitivity can be raised.<br>
In the above-mentioned layer structure, when<br>
only the thermal conductivity is considered, the heat<br>
radiation effect can be promoted even if the thermal<br>
conductivity coefficient of the first protective layer 3<br>
or the fourth protective layer 9 is raised. However, if<br>
the heat radiation is promoted excessively, an<br>
irradiation power needed for recording is raised, which<br>
causes a problem that the recording sensitivity is<br>
remarkably decreased. Thus, it is necessary to maintain<br>
the thermal conductivity low.<br>
By using a thin film protective layer of a low<br>
thermal conductivity, a time delay is given to the<br>
thermal conductance from the recording layer to the<br>
reflective layer or the heat release layer for several<br>
nanoseconds to several tens nanoseconds at a recording<br>
power irradiation start time, and, thereafter, the heat<br>
radiation to the reflective layer or the heat release<br>
layer can be promoted. Thus, there is no unnecessary<br>
decrease in the recording sensitivity by the thermal<br>
conductance of the protective layers.<br>
For the above-mentioned reason, the known<br>
protective layer material containing SiO2, Ta2Os, Al2O3,<br>
AlN, SiN, etc., as a major component is not preferably<br>
used since the material itself has an excessively high<br><br>
thermal conductivity.<br>
Next, a description will be given of the third<br>
protective layer 7.<br>
As for a preferable material of the third<br>
protective layer 7, there are ITO (a mixture composition<br>
of In2O3 and SnO) , IZO (a mixture composition of In2O3<br>
and ZnO), etc., which can raise a light transmittance at<br>
wavelength from 380 nm to 420 nm. Since those materials<br>
have a high thermal conductivity, heat generated when<br>
recording is made in the second recording layer 10 is<br>
radiated through the heat release layer 8. Thereby, the<br>
recording layer, which is made of a phase-change<br>
material containing SbTe as a major component requiring<br>
rapid cooling, is put in an appropriate rapid cooling<br>
state, and, thus, it becomes possible to form a small<br>
amorphous mark.<br>
The third protective layer 7 is preferably as<br>
thick as possible when considering the heat radiation<br>
effect. However, if the thickness exceeds 200 nm, a<br>
stress becomes large and cracking may occur. On the<br>
other hand, if the thickness is smaller than 20 nm, the<br>
heat radiation effect is not sufficient. Thus, the<br>
thickness is preferably 20 nm to 200 nm, and more<br>
preferably 30 nm to 160 nm.<br>
A description will now be given of the<br><br>
reflective layer 2 and the heat release layer 8 that<br>
provide the heat radiation function.<br>
By using a high thermal conductivity material<br>
as the reflective layer 2, an erasure ratio and an<br>
erasure power margin can be improved. As a result of<br>
consideration, in order to exhibit a good erasure<br>
characteristic of the recording layer according to the<br>
present invention in a large erasure power range, it is<br>
preferable to use a layer structure that can flatten not<br>
only a temperature distribution in a direction of the<br>
film thickness and a change with time passage but also a<br>
temperature distribution in a film plane direction<br>
(direction perpendicular to a recording beam scanning<br>
direction). In the present invention, it is preferable<br>
to promote a heat radiation effect in a transverse<br>
direction by using a thin reflective layer having an<br>
extremely high thermal conductivity and a thickness<br>
equal to or smaller than 300 nm.<br>
Moreover, if the film thickness is equal to or<br>
larger than 12 nm, the transmittance is sharply<br>
decreased, and if the film thickness if less than 2 nm,<br>
a modulation after recording cannot be performed, and,<br>
thus, the film thickness is preferably 2 nm to 12 nm,<br>
and more preferably 6 nm to 10 nm when considering a-<br>
dual-layer recording and reproduction characteristic<br><br>
(transmittance of a light incident side and recording<br>
and reproduction characteristic).<br>
The modulation is a value given by an equation<br>
"(high-reflection part - low-reflection part)/high-<br>
reflection part)" where the low reflection part is an<br>
amorphous portion formed after recording and the high<br>
reflection part is a portion erased and crystallized<br>
when recording.<br>
Moreover, a thermal conductivity of a thin<br>
film is generally smaller than that of a bulk state.<br>
Especially, in a thin film having a thickness smaller -<br>
than 4 0 nm, there may be a case where the thermal<br>
conductivity is reduced more than one order due to<br>
influences of an island structure at an initial stage of<br>
growth, which is not preferable. Further, since<br>
crystallinity and an amount of impurity vary depending<br>
on a film deposition condition, there may be a case<br>
where a thermal conductivity differs even if an attempt<br>
is made to form a film having the same composition, and,<br>
thereby a consideration should be given.<br>
Although the heat radiation by the reflective<br>
layer 2 of the first recording structure layer 100 can<br>
be promoted even when the thickness of the reflective<br>
layer 2 is increased, if the thickness exceeds 300 nm,<br>
the thermal conductance in a direction of the film<br><br>
thickness is much more remarkable than the thermal<br>
conductance in a plane direction of the first recoding<br>
layer 4, and, thus, a temperature distribution improving<br>
effect in the plane direction of the film cannot be<br>
obtained. Additionally, the heat capacity of the<br>
reflective layer 2 itself is increased, and cooling of<br>
not only the reflective layer 2 but also the first<br>
recording layer 4 takes a long time, which prevents<br>
formation of an amorphous mark. Most preferably, the<br>
reflective layer 2 having a high thermal conductivity is<br>
made thin so as to selectively promote the heat<br>
radiation in a transverse direction. In a<br>
conventionally used rapid cooling structure, an attempt<br>
is made to rapidly release heat from the first recording<br>
layer 4 to the reflective layer 2 in consideration of<br>
only one-dimensional heat release in the plane direction<br>
of the film, and, thus, there is insufficient attention<br>
paid to flattening the temperature distribution in the<br>
plane direction.<br>
As a material of the reflective layer 2, there<br>
are Ag or an Ag alloy, an Al alloy, etc. As an Ag alloy,<br>
the same Ag alloy as that used for the heat release<br>
layer 8 mentioned later may be used. When using an Ag<br>
alloy for the reflective layer 2, a film thickness of 30<br>
to 200 nm is preferable. If the film thickness is<br><br>
smaller than 30 nm, the heat radiation effect is<br>
insufficient even if a pure Ag is used. If the film<br>
thickness exceeds 200 nm, heat is released in a<br>
perpendicular direction rather than a horizontal<br>
direction, and there is no contribution to improvement<br>
of the heat distribution in the horizontal direction.<br>
An unnecessarily large thickness may deteriorate<br>
productivity and also deteriorate microscopic flatness<br>
of the film surface.<br>
As for an Al ally, there is an alloy<br>
containing at least one of Ta, Ti, Co, Cr, Si, Sc, Hf,<br>
Pd, Pt, Mg, Zr, Mo and Mn by 0.2 to 2 atomic %. In such<br>
an alloy, a volume resistivity is increased in<br>
proportion to a concentration of the additive element,<br>
and also a hillock resistance is improved, and, thus,<br>
the alloy can be used in consideration of a permanence,<br>
a volume resistivity, a film deposition rate, etc. If<br>
an amount of additive impurity is less than 0.2 atomic %,<br>
there are many cases where a hillock resistance is<br>
insufficient, although it depends on a film deposition<br>
condition. On the other hand, if the amount of additive<br>
impurity is larger than 2 atomic %, it is difficult to<br>
obtain the above-mentioned low resistivity. When<br>
putting an importance to a stability over time, Ta is<br>
preferable as the additive component.<br><br>
Further, an Al-Cu based alloy containing Cu by<br>
0.3 to 5.0 atomic % is preferable. Especially, when<br>
using a dual-layer structure protective layer in which a<br>
film having a mixture composition of ZnS and SiO2 and a<br>
film of Ta2O5, an Al-Cu based alloy containing Cu by 0.5<br>
to 4.0 atomic % is preferably used since it satisfies a<br>
corrosion resistance, an adhesion nature and a high<br>
thermal conductivity in a balanced manner. Additionally,<br>
an Al-Mg-Si based alloy containing Si by 0.3 to 0.8<br>
atomic % and Mg by 0.3 to 1.2 atomic % is preferable.<br>
When using the above-mentioned Al alloy as a<br>
reflective layer, a preferable film thickness is 150 to<br>
300 nm. If the film thickness is smaller than 150 nm,<br>
even pure Al has insufficient heat radiation effect. On<br>
the other hand, if the film thickness exceeds 300 nm,<br>
heat is released in a perpendicular direction rather<br>
than a horizontal direction, as is the same as the Ag<br>
alloy, which does not contributes to an improvement of<br>
heat distribution in the horizontal direction, and a<br>
heat capacity of the reflective layer 2 itself becomes<br>
large, thereby decreasing a cooling rate of the<br>
recording layer. Additionally, a microscopic flatness<br>
of the film surface is deteriorated.<br>
The present inventor found that the volume<br>
resistivity of the Al alloy or Ag alloy used for the<br><br>
reflective layer 2 increases in proportion to an<br>
additive element concentration. On the other hand, it<br>
is generally considered that addition of impurities<br>
generally decreases a crystal grain diameter and<br>
increases electron scattering at grain boundaries, which<br>
cause a decrease in a thermal conductivity. Adjusting<br>
an amount of additive impurities is necessary for<br>
increasing the crystal grain diameter to acquire a high<br>
thermal conductivity which the material originally has.<br>
A description will now be given of the heat<br>
release layer 8 formed of Cu or a Cu alloy.<br>
In the second record layer 10 of the present<br>
invention, a crystal growth near the crystallization<br>
temperature (Tm) when being resolidified is a bottleneck<br>
of recrystallization. In order to assure formation of<br>
an amorphous mark and an edge of the amorphous mark by<br>
increasing a cooling rate to the maximum near Tm, an<br>
ultra rapid cooling structure is effective.<br>
Additionally, flattening of a temperature distribution<br>
in a direction of a film surface assures an erasure by<br>
recrystallization so that an original rapid erasure near<br>
Tm can be maintained with a higher erasure power. Thus,<br>
if the ultra rapid cooling structure, which considers a<br>
thermal conductivity delay effect near Tm, is applied to<br>
the second recording structure layer 200 according to<br><br>
the present invention, a further effect can be obtained<br>
than the conventional GeTe-Sb2Te3 recording layer.<br>
In the present invention, the heat release<br>
layer 8 is provided to achieve such an ultra rapid<br>
cooling. When forming the heat release layer 8, it is<br>
necessary to eliminate unevenness in the film thickness<br>
by decreasing a deposition rate for film deposition to<br>
be smaller than that of the reflective layer 2. The<br>
film thickness is preferably equal to or greater than 2<br>
nm and smaller than 10 nm. If the film thickness is<br>
smaller than 2 nm, unevenness occurs even when the<br>
deposition rate is made small. If the film thickness is<br>
not smaller than 10 nm, since the transparency of the<br>
second recording structure layer 200 cannot be raised, a<br>
light does not reach the first recording layer 4. Thus,<br>
the transmittance of the second recording structure<br>
layer 200 is preferably equal to or greater than 45%.<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph showing characteristics of<br>
absorption A, transmission T and reflection R of various<br>
metals used for a reflective layer and a heat release<br>
layer. It should be noted that the film thickness of<br>
each metal is 1 nm.<br>
It can be appreciated from FIG. 3, Cu or a Cu<br>
alloy has a higher transmittance T than a metal such as<br>
Ag, Pt, Au, etc. That is, Cu or a Cu alloy is<br><br>
appropriate for the heat release layer 8 which is<br>
arranged on the light incident side. It should be noted<br>
that by adding Mo to Cu by several %, a good<br>
characteristic can be obtained in that there is little<br>
jitter even in a 80 degrees - 85% reliability test.<br>
Although the reflective layer 2 and the heat<br>
release layer 8 are usually formed by a sputter method<br>
or a vacuum vapor-deposition method, a total amount of<br>
impurities including a water component and oxygen mixed<br>
during film deposition as well as impurities contained<br>
in a target and a vapor deposition material itself must<br>
be reduced to be equal to or less than 2 atomic %.<br>
Accordingly, an ultimate vacuum in a process chamber is<br>
preferably 1X10-3Pa. Additionally, when performing film<br>
deposition at an ultimate vacuum lower than 10-4Pa, it is<br>
preferable to prevent impurities from being taken in by<br>
setting a film deposition rate to be equal to or higher<br>
than 1 nm/sec, and preferably, equal to or higher than<br>
10 nm/sec. Or, if additive elements are contained<br>
intentionally by an amount more than 1 atomic %, the<br>
film deposition rate is preferably increased to be equal<br>
to or higher than 10 nm/sec so as to prevent additional<br>
impurities from being mixed.<br>
There is a case where a film deposition<br>
condition gives influences to a crystal grain diameter<br><br>
irrespective of an amount of impurities. For example,<br>
in an alloy film containing Al with Ta added by about 2<br>
atomic %, an amorphous phase is mixed between crystal<br>
grains, but a ratio of the amorphous phase to a crystal<br>
phase depends on a film deposition condition.<br>
Additionally, a ratio of the crystal part increases, a<br>
volume resistivity decreases and a thermal conductivity<br>
increases as sputtering is performed at a lower pressure.<br>
An impurity composition or crystallinity in a<br>
film also depends on a method of producing an alloy<br>
target used for sputtering and a sputtering gas (Ar, Ne,<br>
Xe, etc). Thus, a volume resistivity of a thin film<br>
state is not defined only by a metal material and<br>
composition. In order to acquire a high thermal<br>
conductivity, it is preferable to lessen an amount of<br>
impurities as mentioned above. However, on the other<br>
hand, since pure metal such as Al or Ag tends to be<br>
inferior in a corrosion resistance and a hillock<br>
resistance, it is necessary to determine an optimum<br>
composition in consideration of a balance of both.<br>
In order to acquire a higher thermal<br>
conductivity and reliability, it is effective to make<br>
the reflective layer in a multilayer structure. In this<br>
case, at least one layer is formed of the above-<br>
mentioned high thermal conductivity material (low volume<br><br>
resistivity material) having a film thickness of equal<br>
to or grater than 50% of a total film thickness and<br>
substantially contributes to a heat radiation effect,<br>
and other layers contribute to an improvement in a<br>
corrosion resistance and an adhesive nature with the<br>
protective layer and a hillock resistance.<br>
Specifically, when using Ag, which has a<br>
highest thermal conductivity and a lowest volume<br>
resistivity among metals, if S is contained in the<br>
protective layer adjacent to Ag, a corrosion by S tends<br>
to occur and there is a tendency that deterioration when<br>
overwrite (O/W) is repeated is slightly fast.<br>
Additionally, corrosion tends to occur under an<br>
acceleration test environment with a high temperature<br>
and a high humidity.<br>
Then, when using Ag or an Ag alloy as a low<br>
volume resistivity material, although not shown in the<br>
figure, it is effective to provide an Al alloy layer<br>
having a thickness of 1 to 100 nm as an interface layer<br>
between the Ag or Ag alloy layer and the adjacent<br>
protective layer. As for the Al alloy, a material the<br>
same as that mentioned in relation to the reflective<br>
layer 2 can be used. If the thickness of the interface<br>
layer is smaller than 1 nm, a protection effect is not<br>
sufficient. If the thickness exceeds 100 nm, a heat<br><br>
radiation effect is sacrificed. Additionally, if the<br>
thickness is equal to or larger than 5 nm, the layer<br>
does not have an island structure, which tends to<br>
achieve a uniform formation.<br>
Further, if an Ag alloy heat release layer and<br>
an Al alloy interface layer are used, it is preferable<br>
to provide an interface oxidation layer by oxidizing the<br>
Al surface by a thickness equal to or larger than 1 nm<br>
since mutual diffusion tends to occur in the combination<br>
of Ag and Al. It should be noted that if the thickness<br>
of the interface oxidation layer exceeds 5 nm,<br>
especially, 10 nm, the layer serves as a thermal<br>
resistance, and it is not preferable since the original<br>
function of the heat release layer that a heat radiation<br>
effect is extremely high is deteriorated.<br>
It is also possible to measure each thermal<br>
conductivity directly in order to specify the reflective<br>
layer 2 and the heat release layer 8 having a high<br>
thermal conductivity that show a good characteristic in<br>
the present invention, and it can be estimated whether<br>
or not the thermal conductance is good by using an<br>
electric resistance. In a material such as a metal film<br>
in which mainly electrons control conduction of heat or<br>
electricity, there is a good relationship between a<br>
thermal conductivity and an electric conductivity. An<br><br>
electric resistance of a thin film is represented by a<br>
resistivity value standardized by a film thickness or an<br>
area of a measuring area. The volume resistivity and<br>
the area resistivity can be measured by a normal four<br>
probe method which is specified by Japanese Industrial<br>
Standard JIS N 7194. According to the method, data<br>
having good repeatablility can be obtained mush easier<br>
than measuring a thermal conductivity of a thin film.<br>
As a preferable characteristic of the<br>
reflective layer 2 and the heat release layer 8, the<br>
volume resistivity is 20 to 150 nΩ.m, and preferably 20<br>
to 100 nΩ.m. It is difficult practically to form a<br>
material having a volume resistivity smaller than 20<br>
nΩ.m in a thin film state. Additionally, in a case<br>
where the volume resistivity is greater than 150 nΩ.m,<br>
the area resistivity can be reduced by making the film<br>
thick to have a thickness exceeding 300 nm, for example.<br>
However, according to consideration of the inventors,<br>
decreasing only the area resistivity of such a high<br>
volume resistivity material cannot provide a sufficient<br>
heat radiation effect since a thick film increases a<br>
heat capacity per unit area. Additionally, formation of<br>
such a thick film takes a long time and a material cost<br>
is increased, and, thus, it is not preferable in a view<br>
point of a manufacturing cost. Further, increasing the<br><br>
film thickness may deteriorate the microscopic flatness<br>
of the surface of the film. It is preferable to use a<br>
low volume resistivity material which can provide an<br>
area resistivity of 0.2 to 0.9 Ω/□, and more preferably<br>
0.5 Ω/□.<br>
The above-mentioned multilayering of the<br>
reflective layer 2 or the heat release layer 8 is<br>
effective in obtaining a desired area resistivity with a<br>
desired film thickness by combining a high volume<br>
reisstivity material and a low volume resistivity<br>
material. An adjustment of a volume resistivity by<br>
alloying can simplify a sputtering process by using an<br>
alloy target. However, it causes an increase in a<br>
target cost, and subsequently an increase in a raw<br>
material ratio of a medium. Accordingly, it is also<br>
effective to acquire a desired volume resistivity by<br>
multilayering a thin film of pure Al, pure Ag and pure<br>
Au and a thin film of the above-mentioned additive<br>
elements. If a number of layers is up to around three,<br>
an initial apparatus cost may be increased but a medium<br>
cost may be decreased. It is preferable that the<br>
reflective layer has a multilayer structure including a<br>
plurality of metal films and a total film thickness is<br>
40 to 300 nm, and more than 50% of the total film<br>
thickness is a metal thin film layer (may be a plurality<br><br>
of layers) having a volume resistivity of 20 to 150<br>
nΩ.m.<br>
When using a high NA objective lens in the<br>
structure where the cover substrate 12 is made thin as<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the cover substrate 12 is preferably a<br>
sheet material since the thickness of the cover<br>
substrate 12 is preferably equal to or smaller than 0.3<br>
mm, more preferably 0.6 mm. If NA is 0.50 to 0.7, the<br>
cover substrate 12 having a thickness of 0.6 mm may be<br>
used.<br>
As a material of the cover substrate 12, a<br>
polycarbonate resin, an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, a<br>
polystyrene resin, an acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer<br>
resin, a polyethylene resin, a polypropylene resin, a<br>
silicone resin, a fluorocarbon resin, an ABS resin, a<br>
urethane resin, etc., can be used, and the polycarbonate<br>
resin and the acrylic resin are preferable since they<br>
are excellent in an optical characteristic and cost.<br>
As a method of forming the thin cover<br>
substrate using a transparent sheet made of those<br>
materials, there is a method in which a transparent<br>
sheet is applied via an ultraviolet (UV) curable resin<br>
or a transparent both-sided pressure sensitive sheet.<br>
Additionally, the thin cover substrate may be formed by<br>
applying an ultraviolet (UV) curable resin onto a<br><br>
protective layer. The above-mentioned resin can be used<br>
for the resin intermediate layer and the adhesive layer,<br>
but the UV curable resin is preferable since it is<br>
excellent in cost.<br>
Although the present invention is explained<br>
below in detail by showing examples and comparative<br>
examples, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
examples.<br>
Here, the second recording structure layer<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "L0 layer") 200 has a<br>
structure in which both transmission and absorption are<br>
satisfied since it must transmit a light therethrough<br>
and also absorb the light to perform recording. On the<br>
other hand, the first recording structure layer<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "L1 layer") 100 is desired<br>
to have a high recording sensitivity since an amount of<br>
light reaching the LI layer 100 is smaller by an amount<br>
corresponding to an amount of absorption of the L0 layer<br>
200 as compared to a single layer medium.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors prepared a<br>
phase-change type optical recording medium having the<br>
layer structure as shown in FIG. 2. The substrate 1 was<br>
made of polycarbonate having a thickness of 0.6 mm. The<br>
reflective layer 2 had a composition of Ag97Cu1Pt1Pd1.<br>
The first protective layer 3 was a mixture layer of SnOx<br><br>
and TaOx. The first recording layer 4 had a composition<br>
of Ag5In5S65Te25. The second protective layer 5 was made<br>
of ZnS.SiO2. The resin intermediate layer 6 was made of<br>
a UV curable resin (Catalog No. SD318 manufactured by<br>
Mitsubishi Material Company). The third protective<br>
layer was made of IZO. The heat release layer 8 was<br>
made of C99M01. The fourth protective layer was made of<br>
ZnS.SiO2. The second recording layer 10 had a<br>
composition of Ge5In20Sb75. The fifth protective layer 11<br>
was formed of a mixture layer of SnOx and TaOx. The<br>
cover substrate 12 was made of polycarbonate. It should<br>
be noted that the layers other than the resin<br>
intermediate layer 6 having a thickness of 35 µm and<br>
the cover substrate 12 having a thickness of 0.6 mm were<br>
formed by a sputter method while controlling a film<br>
thickness.<br>
Specifically, a depth of a groove of the L0<br>
layer 200 was 240 A, a half value width was 0.3 Aim, and<br>
a reflectance was set to 5.5%. A depth of a groove of<br>
the L1 layer 100 was 270 A, a half value width was 0.29<br>
µm, and a reflectance was set to 6.0%. The L0 layer<br>
200 and the L1 layer 100 were formed by sputtering on an<br>
injection molded polycarbonate substrate having a track<br>
pitch of 0.74 µm and a thickness of 0.6 mm, and applied<br>
together by an UV curable resin (UV irradiation was made<br><br>
from the side having a high transmittance). At that<br>
time, the present inventors prepared a plurality of<br>
phase-change type optical recording media by varying the<br>
film deposition condition of the L0 layer.<br>
FIG. 4 is an illustration showing film<br>
deposition conditions of sample discs prepared by the<br>
present inventors.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 4, in the<br>
present examples, the fifth recording layer 11 of the L0<br>
layer 200 was formed with a film thickness of 200 nm or<br>
220 nm, and the second recording layer 10 was formed of<br>
a composition of In15Sb80Ge5 with a film thickness of 7 nm<br>
or 8 nm. Then, the fourth protective layer 9 made of a<br>
mixture oxide of AnOx and TaOx was formed with a film<br>
thickness of 20 nm, and, thereafter, the heat release<br>
layer 8 made of Cu was formed with a film thickness of 7<br>
nm or 8 nm, and further the third protective layer 7 was<br>
formed with a film thickness of 70 nm to 110 nm. It<br>
should be noted that those film thicknesses were varied<br>
so as to equalize the transmittance when the disc was<br>
formed by a dual-layer structure.<br>
For example, the sample number L0J was a disc<br>
having the L0 layer 200 using 0.575 mm substrate (a<br>
polycarbonate substrate having a thickness of 0.6 mm<br>
±0.05 mm with NA=0.6 or NA=0.65), and the fifth<br><br>
protective layer 11 having a film thickness of 220 nm,<br>
the second recording layer 10 having a film thickness of<br>
8 nm, the fourth protective layer 9 having a film<br>
thickness of 20 nm, a heat release layer 8 having a film<br>
thickness of 8 nm, and the third protective layer 7<br>
having a film thickness of 70 nm were formed on the L0<br>
layer 200.<br>
At this time, L1 layer 100 was formed using a<br>
0.575 mm substrate, and an Ag layer as the reflective<br>
layer 2 having a thickness of 140 nm, a mixture layer of<br>
SnOx and TaOx having a film thickness of 20 nm as the<br>
first protective layer 3, a composition of<br>
Ge5Ag2In2Sb71Te20 having a thickness of 15 nm as the first<br>
recording layer 4, and a ZnS.SiO2 layer having a<br>
thickness of 120 nm as the second protective layer 5<br>
were formed in that order on the L1 layer 100 using a<br>
sputtering apparatus. It should be noted that the L1<br>
layer 100 may have the same structure as a single layer<br>
medium such as, for example, a DVD+RW 2.4x or a DVD+RW<br>
4x, and thus, in the present examples, the above-<br>
mentioned film deposition condition of the L1 layer 100<br>
was fixed and the film deposition condition of the L0<br>
layer 200 was varied.<br>
It should be noted that, in FIG. 4, the<br>
substrate thickness (1) indicates 0.575 mm, the<br><br>
substrate thickness (2) indicates 0.6 mm, and the<br>
substrate thickness (3) indicates 0.61 mm. Additionally,<br>
since the fifth protective layer 11 is thick and has a<br>
film thickness of 200 nm or 220 nm and a thermal<br>
deformation occurs when producing by a single sputter<br>
cathode, the fifth protective layer 11 was formed using<br>
a cathode 1 and a cathode 2 and dividing into four times<br>
as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 5 is an illustration showing a<br>
reflectance, a modulation and a value of a product<br>
(RXM) of those of a disc produced according to the film<br>
deposition condition shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 6 is an<br>
illustration showing a result of evaluations as to<br>
whether or not focusing, tracking (push-pull) and<br>
reproduction of the disc produced according to the film<br>
deposition condition shown in FIG. 4 can be made.<br>
As appreciated from FIGS. 5 and 6, the<br>
focusing and tracking can be made if the reflectance of<br>
each of the recording structure layers 100 and 200 is<br>
equal to or grater than 2%. On the other hand, it was<br>
found that a Differential Phase Detection (DPD)<br>
reproduction, which is a reproduction method of a DVD<br>
player, is possible when a value of a product (RXM) of<br>
a reflectance of a high reflection part and a modulation<br>
of each of the recording structure layers 100 and 200<br><br>
was equal to or greater than 2.8. That is, it was found<br>
that if the product (RXM) of the reflectance of the<br>
high reflection part and the modulation of the phase-<br>
change type optical recording medium after recording is<br>
set to a value equal to or greater than a lower limit<br>
value (2.8), a reproduction can be made. More<br>
specifically, it was found that if the product of the<br>
reflectance of the high reflection part and the<br>
modulation is set to a value equal to or greater than<br>
the lower limit value (2.8) by varying the film<br>
deposition condition of the L0 layer 200 which is the<br>
second recording structure layer, a phase-change type<br>
optical recording medium having a dual-layer structure<br>
can be achieved.<br>
This is because if the product (RXM) of the<br>
reflectance of the high reflection part and the<br>
modulation of each of the recording structure layers 100<br>
and 200 after recording, an S/N ratio of a signal read<br>
from the phase-change type optical recording medium by a<br>
pickup is improved as shown in FIG. 7, and a<br>
reproduction possible level is reached when the product<br>
(RXM) of the reflectance and the modulation becomes 2.8.<br>
In the meantime, in a case where a disc has a<br>
dual-layer structure and a red LD (wavelength<br>
corresponding to a DVD) is used, if an energy density is<br><br>
low, it is necessary to produce a rapid cooling<br>
structure on the recording medium side since a rapid<br>
cooling cannot be achieved when recording unlike a case<br>
where a blue wavelength is used and NA is large<br>
(NA=0.85). However, in a case of a dual-layer structure,<br>
since the transmittance of the heat release layer 8 must<br>
be 40% to 50%, it is difficult to form a sufficient<br>
metal heat release layer like a single-layer medium.<br>
An Al alloy or an Ag alloy (including pure Ag)<br>
can be formed with a thickness of 100 nm in a<br>
conventional single-layer medium, while an Al alloy or<br>
an Ag alloy (including pure Ag) cannot be formed with a<br>
thickness of 5 nm to 10 nm due to a transmittance in the<br>
red wavelength of a DVD, and, thus, a heat radiation is<br>
insufficient.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors considered<br>
and studied, and found that an amorphous corresponding<br>
to a recording linear velocity cannot be formed unless a<br>
composition greatly exceeding a normal recording linear<br>
velocity is selected as shown in FIG. 8. Specifically,<br>
it was found that jitter becomes good by setting the<br>
recording linear velocity to a value equal to or higher<br>
than about 15 m/sec, which exceeds a normal recording<br>
linear velocity of 2.4x (9.2 m/sec).<br>
In a medium such as a conventional single-<br><br>
layer medium (DVD+RW 4x, 8x) in which the film thickness<br>
of the reflective layer can be equal to or greater than<br>
100 nm, an amorphous can be easily formed since it is a<br>
rapid cooling structure. Thus, a recording layer having<br>
a velocity faster than a speed of recording and<br>
reproduction characteristic by several m/sec can achieve<br>
a good recording and reproduction characteristic.<br>
However, since the layer structure on the light incident<br>
side of a dual-layer RW medium is translucent, it is<br>
much more difficult to form a rapid cooling structure<br>
than a single-layer medium. Thus, since it is difficult<br>
to form an anamorphous in a crystal state, it is<br>
necessary to increase the transition speed of the<br>
recording layer itself to about 1.5 times the recording<br>
linear velocity.<br>
Here, explaining a method of measuring a<br>
transition linear velocity, a crystal level (RF signal<br>
level) is measured by applying a DC erase power to a<br>
medium after initialized. The power for DC erase is<br>
sufficiently larger than an erase power for recording.<br>
In a case of DVD, a DC power of 15 mW was irradiated.<br>
An amorphous cannot be formed unless the transition<br>
linear velocity of the medium is set with respect to the<br>
recording linear velocity. Since it is difficult to<br>
form an amorphous, normally, a modulation is lower than<br><br>
that of a single-layer medium, and modulation<br>
(M)=(RF(crystal)-RF(amorphous))/RF reaches about 0.45 at<br>
the maximum.<br>
Additionally, the reflectance is about one-<br>
third of that of a single-layer medium, which is about<br>
6%, and the product of the reflectance (R) and the<br>
modulation (M) is one of performances of a low<br>
reflection medium. Additionally, the reflectances of<br>
both layers are not equal to each other in the dual-<br>
layer medium, and are 7% and 5% and a total of<br>
reflectances of the both layers is 12% to 15% and an<br>
average of the reflectances is about 6.75%. As a medium,<br>
the reflectance is 5% to 10%. That is, as indicated as<br>
the product of the reflectance (R) and the modulation<br>
(M) shown in FIG. 7, SN of the system for recording and<br>
reproduction is rapidly improved from a point where the<br>
value of RXM is about 2.8.<br>
As an index to determine a performance of a<br>
medium, a value obtained by multiplying the product of<br>
the reflectance (R) and the modulation (M) by a<br>
reproduction power (Pr) is effective as a system. This<br>
is because if the reproduction light has the same power<br>
as a conventional light, RXM is about 25% of that of a<br>
conventional single-layer media since the reflectance is<br>
about on-third (6% in dual-layer, 18% in single-layer)<br><br>
and the modulation is about three-quarter (0.45 in dual-<br>
layer, more than 0.6 in single-layer). Increasing the<br>
reproduction light power, an absolute level of<br>
modulation amplitude can be raised.<br>
In a case of a dual-layer structure, since the<br>
transmittance on the light incident side is 40% to 50%<br>
as shown in FIG. 9, the film does not deteriorate even<br>
if the light having a double power is irradiated. The<br>
reproduction light depends on a recording film and a<br>
layer structure, and since a difference between a<br>
crystal and an amorphous of a medium of which<br>
reproduction light can have a high power can be obtained,<br>
the SN ratio of the system can be raised.<br>
When the transition linear velocity was varied<br>
as 13 m/sec, 14 m/sec 15 m/s, 16 m/sec and 17 m/sec, a<br>
Sb/(Sb+Te) ratio was set to 0.68, 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, 0,71,<br>
respectively, and the rest was Ge 4%. When a media was<br>
produced with a layer structure (other than recording<br>
layer composition) being a L0A structure, jitter was<br>
best at a transition linear velocity of about 15 m/sec<br>
in a case of a recording linear velocity of 2.4x.<br>
Additionally, deterioration of jitter was within 1% even<br>
when reproduction of one million times are performed<br>
with a reproduction light of 1.3 mW (at 1x), 2 mW (at<br>
2.4x) in any composition. It was found that the system<br><br>
is better as the reproduction light power is higher, and<br>
PrXRXM at 1x is 1.2 mW (±0.1 mW) X2.9%=3.48, which is<br>
about a limit.<br>
FIG. 10 is an illustration showing values of a<br>
DPD signal (phase difference signal (AT/TW) when a<br>
tracking is performed. As a result of experiments,<br>
although illustration is omitted, it was found that a<br>
DPD tracking can be performed when the value of the DPD<br>
signal is equal to or grater than 0.3.<br>
It should be noted that although only the film<br>
deposition condition of the L0 layer 200 is varied in<br>
the present embodiment, a phase-change type optical<br>
recording medium having a dual-layer structure may be<br>
achieved by varying the film deposition condition of the<br>
L1 layer so as to set the product of the reflectance and<br>
the modulation of the high reflection part of each<br>
recording structure layer to a value equal to or greater<br>
than the lower limit value (2.8).<br>
A description will now be given of a<br>
reproduction method of the above-mentioned phase-change<br>
type optical recording medium.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram of an optical disc<br>
apparatus which can reproduce the phase-change type<br>
optical recording medium according to the present<br>
embodiment. The optical disc apparatus 40 shown in FIG.<br><br>
11 comprises a spindle motor 41 for rotationally driving<br>
an optical disc 55, an optical pickup device 42, a laser<br>
control circuit 43, an encoder 44, a motor driver 45, a<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 46, a servo<br>
controller 47, a buffer RAM 48, a buffer manager 49, an<br>
interface 50 of a host computer 56, a ROM 51, a flash<br>
memory 52 as memory means, a CPU 53, a RAM 54, etc. It<br>
should be noted that arrows in FIG. 11 do not show the<br>
connection relationship of the components but indicate<br>
flow of representative signals and information.<br>
The optical pickup device 42 includes a<br>
semiconductor laser emitting a laser light having a<br>
wavelength of about 660 nm, an optical system that<br>
guides the light beam emitted from the semiconductor<br>
laser to a recording surface of the optical disc 55 and<br>
also guides a return light beam reflected by the<br>
recording surface to a predetermined light-receiving<br>
position, a light receiver located at the light-<br>
receiving position so as to receive the return light<br>
beam, and a drive system (a focusing actuator, a<br>
tracking actuator and a seek motor, which are not shown<br>
in the figure). The light receiver outputs an electric<br>
current (a current signal) corresponding to an amount of<br>
received light to the reproduction signal processing<br>
circuit 46.<br><br>
The reproduction signal processing circuit 4 6<br>
converts the current signal, which is an output of the<br>
optical pickup device 42, into a voltage signal, and<br>
detects a wobble signal, a reproduction signal and a<br>
servo signal (a focus error signal, a track error<br>
signal) based on the voltage signal. Then, the<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 4 6 extracts<br>
address information and a synchronization signal, etc.,<br>
from the wobble signal. The address information<br>
extracted here is output to the CPU 53, and the<br>
synchronization signal is output to the encoder 44.<br>
Further, the reproduction signal processing circuit 46<br>
performs an error correction process on the reproduction<br>
signal, and, thereafter, store the reproduction signal<br>
in the buffer RAM 48 through the buffer manager 49.<br>
Additionally, the reproduction signal processing circuit<br>
46 outputs the servo signal to the servo controller 47.<br>
It should be noted that the reproduction signal<br>
processing circuit 46 sets a servo parameter (for<br>
example, a signal level adjustment gain, etc.)<br>
corresponding to a type of the optical disc 55 according<br>
to an instruction from the CPU 53.<br>
The servo controller 47 generates a control<br>
signal for controlling the optical pickup device 42<br>
based on the servo signal, and outputs the control<br><br>
signal to the motor driver 45. The buffer manager 4 9<br>
manages input and output of data to the buffer RAM 48,<br>
and when an amount of data accumulated reaches a<br>
predetermined value, the buffer manager 49 sends a<br>
notification to the CPU 53.<br>
Based on the control signal an instruction<br>
from the CPU 53, the encoder 44 retrieves the data<br>
accumulated in the buffer RAM 4 8 through the buffer<br>
manager 49, and adds an error correction code to the<br>
data so as to produce write data for the optical disc 55.<br>
Then, based on the instruction of the CPU 53, the<br>
encoder 44 outputs the write data to the laser control<br>
circuit 43 in synchronization with the synchronization<br>
signal from the reproduction signal processing circuit<br>
46.<br>
The laser control circuit 43 controls a laser<br>
light output from the optical pickup device 42 based on<br>
the write data from the encoder 44. The interface 50 is<br>
a bidirectional communication interface with the host<br>
(for example, a personal computer, a DVD video recorder<br>
backend) 56, and conforms to a standard interface such<br>
as ATAPI (AT Attachment Packet Interface), SCSI (Small<br>
Computer System Interface), etc.<br>
The ROM 51 stores programs including a program<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "disc distinguish program")<br><br>
which distinguishes a type of an optical disc described<br>
by a code readable by the CPU 53. The flash memory 52<br>
is a nonvolatile memory, which maintains recorded<br>
contents even when a power is turned off, and is<br>
readable or writable by the CPU 53. The CPU 53 controls<br>
an operation of each part in accordance with the above-<br>
mentioned program stored n the ROM 51, and temporarily<br>
stores data necessary for the control in the RAM 34.<br>
It should be noted that when a power of the<br>
optical disc device 40 is turned on, the above-mentioned<br>
program stored in the ROM 51 is loaded to a main memory<br>
(not shown in the figure) of the CPU 53. Additionally,<br>
the optical disc device 40 is capable of accessing, as<br>
an example, a reproduction only DVD, a recordable DVD±R<br>
and a rewritable DVD+RW.<br>
FIG. 12 is a circuit diagram using a<br>
preferable AGC method according to the present invention.<br>
Signals VA, VB, VC and VD from the optical<br>
pickup device 42 (PU 42) are arbitrarily multiplied by a<br>
gain by a variable gain amplifier (VGA) 66. The gain<br>
Ginpd can be set according to an instruction from the<br>
CPU 53, and can be set by an INPDG control signal.<br>
As for the focal error signal, an operation of<br>
FE=Ginpdx [(A+C)-(B+D)] is performed by an FE<br>
calculation circuit 61. As for the track error signal,<br><br>
an operation of TE=Ginpdx [(B+C)-(A+D)] is performed by<br>
a TE calculation circuit 62. As for a sum signal, an<br>
operation of SUM=Ginpdx (A+B+C+D) is performed by a SUM<br>
calculation circuit 63. A normalization circuit<br>
includes an AGCCNT circuit 64 and VCAs 65. A gain of<br>
each of the VCA 65 (VCA gain) is set so that a level of<br>
the SUM signal input to the AGCCNT circuit 64 is equal<br>
to a certain value, here, 0.5 V. When the level of the<br>
SUM signal is 0.5 V, the VCA gain is four times. When<br>
the level of the SUM signal is 0.5 V, the VCA gain is<br>
two times. When the level of the SUM signal is 0.1 V,<br>
the VCA gain is one time. That is, the TE signal and<br>
the FE signal are multiplied by G=1/SUM.<br>
The gain of each of the VCAs 65 for the TE<br>
signal and the FE signal is represented by GAIN=1/SUM,<br>
and an AGC operation of the FE signal and the TE signal<br>
is carried out as follows at this time.<br>
FEn=[(A+C )-(B+D)]/(A+B+C+D)<br>
TEn=[(B+C )-(A+D)]/(A+B+C+D)<br>
Although the gain range of each of the VCAs 65<br>
covers a range from 0.7 to 5.6 times (-3dB to +15dB)<br>
practically, it is desirable to use at +6dB as a center.<br>
Therefore, what is necessary is to set INPDG so that the<br>
gain of the VGA 66 becomes equal to +6dB. The gain<br>
range of the VGA 66 also covers a range from 0.7 to 5.6<br><br>
times (-3dB to +15dB) practically.<br>
When the optical disk 55 is mounted in the<br>
drive, an LD is turned on and a focus search is<br>
performed to move an objective lens of the PU 42 upward<br>
or downward. FIG. 13 shows a SUM signal and an MIRR<br>
signal at that time. A peak value of the SUM signal is<br>
output by a peak hold circuit shown in FIG. 12 as the<br>
MIRR signal. The peak value of the SUM signal<br>
corresponds to a case where a spot of the PU 42 is<br>
focused on a disc surface, and a mirror surface level of<br>
the optical disc 55 is detected.<br>
A level of the MIRR signal is read by the CPU<br>
53 and an AD converter (not shown in the figure) to know<br>
the level. If the level is 1.0 V, a setting value of<br>
0.5/1V=0.5=-6dB is calculated by the CPU 53, and is set<br>
to INPDG. At this time, since the output from the PU 42<br>
is multiplied by 0.5 by the INPDG of the VGA 66, the SUM<br>
signal when applying a focus must be 0.5 V, which was<br>
originally 1 V. Thus, the AGC gain of the VCA 65 at<br>
that time must be the center of 1/0.5V=2=6dB.<br>
Incidentally, if the INPDG is not set up<br>
(unchanged at 0 dB), since the SUM signal remains<br>
unchanged at IV, the AGC gain of the VCA 65 is 1/1V=1=0<br>
dB, which is not preferable since it is close to a lower<br>
limit of the practical AGC range.<br><br>
The power of a reproduction light beam from<br>
the optical pickup device 42 is about 0.7 mW. In this<br>
condition, for example, the MIRR level of a reproduction<br>
only DVD having a reflectance of 80% is 0.7 V. Thus, a<br>
setting value of 0.5/0.7V=0.7 (corresponding to -3dB) is<br>
calculated by the CPU 53, and is set to the INPDG. At<br>
this time, since the output of the PU 42 is multiplied<br>
by 0.7 by the INPDG of the VGA 66, the SUM signal when a<br>
focus is applied becomes equal to 0.5 V. Thus, the AGC<br>
gain of the VCA 65 becomes a center of 1/0.5=2<br>
(corresponding to 6 dB), thereby exhibiting a good servo<br>
performance.<br>
The MIRR level of a dual-layer structure DVD<br>
±RW having a reflectance of, for example, 5% is 0.045 V,<br>
and, thus, a setting value of 0.5/0.045V=11<br>
(corresponding to 21 dB) is calculated by the CPU 53.<br>
However, this value exceeds 12 dB, which is an upper<br>
limit of the practical AGC range of the VGA 66. Thus,<br>
the power of the reproduction light beam from the light<br>
pickup device 42 is set to about 1.4 mW, which is two<br>
times the conventional value. At this time, the MIRR<br>
level of the dual-layer structure DVD±RW having a<br>
reflectance of 5% is 0.09 V. Thus, a setting value of<br>
0.5/0.09V=5.6 (corresponding to 15 dB) is calculated by<br>
the CPU 53, and is set to the INPDG. At this time,<br><br>
since the output of the PU 42 is multiplied by 5.6 by<br>
the INPDG of the VGA 66, the SUM signal when a focus is<br>
applied becomes equal to 0.5 V. Thus, the AGC gain of<br>
the VCA 65 becomes a center of 1/0.5=2 (corresponding to<br>
6 dB), thereby exhibiting a good servo performance.<br>
Although it is mentioned that the LD power is<br>
about 0.7 mW, an actual value of the LD power may be in<br>
a range of 0.5 to 0.9 mW since a control accuracy of the<br>
semiconductor laser fluctuates about ±30% containing an<br>
initial setting accuracy. Similarly, an actual value of<br>
the LD power may be 1.0 to 1.8 mW when the LD power is<br>
about 1.4 mW. That is, setting the power of the<br>
reproduction light beam from the optical pickup device<br>
42 to about 1.4 mW, which is two times the conventional<br>
value, means that the power is set to 1.0 to 1.8 mW.<br>
A description will now be given, with<br>
reference to FIG. 14, of a conventional focus pull-in<br>
method. After turning on the LD and moving the<br>
objective lens of the PU 42 upward and downward by<br>
performing a focus search, the FE signal (focus signal)<br>
shown in FIG. 14 is obtained. This signal is for<br>
focusing on the first recording structure layer 100 or<br>
the second recording structure layer 200. However,<br>
since a signal is generated at a surface of the cover<br>
substrate 12, the focus is pulled in only when the SUM<br><br>
signal is equal to or higher than a threshold level so<br>
as to prevent a focus being erroneously pulled in at the<br>
surface of the cover substrate 12. However, in the<br>
dual-layer structure DVD±RW, which has a reflectance<br>
about one-third of that of a recordable dual-layer DVD±R,<br>
the SUM signal having the same level as that generated<br>
by the first recording structure layer 100 and the<br>
second recording structure layer 200 may be generated<br>
from the surface of the cover substrate 12 as shown in<br>
FIG. 15. Thereby, the threshold level to prevent a pull<br>
in of a focus at the surface of the cover substrate 12<br>
cannot be set. Thus, a pull in of a focus is performed<br>
in a direction moving from the first recording structure<br>
layer 100 to the second recording structure layer 200.<br>
Additionally, a pull in of a focus can be<br>
quick if a focal point (shown in FIG. 12) of a light<br>
beam outgoing from the objective lens of the optical<br>
pickup device 42 is located on the substrate 1 side of<br>
the first recording layer 4, that is, beyond the first<br>
recording layer 4.<br>
It should be noted that there is provided<br>
according to the present embodiment a processor readable<br>
recording medium storing a program causing a computer to<br>
perform the above-mentioned reproduction method and a<br>
computer readable reproduction program causing a<br><br>
computer to perform the above-mentioned reproduction<br>
method.<br>
A description will now be given of a phase-<br>
change type optical recording medium according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 16 is<br>
an illustration of a cross section of a layer structure<br>
of the phase-change type optical recording medium<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 16, parts that are the same as the<br>
parts shown in FIG. 2 are given the same reference<br>
numerals, and description thereof will be omitted.<br>
The phase-change type optical recording medium<br>

invention has the same structure as the above-mentioned<br>
phase-change type optical recording medium according to<br>
the first embodiment except for an interface layer 13<br>

The interface layer 13 is provided between the<br>
reflective layer 2 and the first protective layer 3, and<br>
is made of TiC.TiO2. The sixth protective layer 14 is<br>
provided between the fifth protective layer 11 and the<br>
cover substrate 12, and is made of IZO.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiments, and variations and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the<br><br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
