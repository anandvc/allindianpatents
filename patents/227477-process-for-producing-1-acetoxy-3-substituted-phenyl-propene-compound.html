PROCESS FOR PRODUCING l-ACETOXY-3-(SUBSTITUTED PHENYL)PROPENE COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a l-acetoxy-3-(substituted phenyl)propene compound.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for producing a l-acetoxy-3-(substituted phenyl)propene compound having a phenyl group substituted with a substituent group, for example, an alkoxy group or an alkylenedioxy group, and located in the 3-position of the propene compound.<br>
The l-acetoxy-3-(substituted phenyl)propene compound produced by the process of the present invention is useful as an intermediate material for perfumes, Pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and other organic synthetic chemicals. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Bull, Soc, Chim, Frame, 1961, pl!95 - 1198, discloses, as a process for synthesizing a l-acetoxy-3-(substituted phenyl)propene compound, a process for synthesizing l-acetoxy-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propene by reacting 1,2-dimethoxybenzene with an alkenylidene diacetate in the presence of titanium tetrachloride activated with a boron trifluoride-ether complex.  This literature reported that the yield of the target compound produced by this process was 62%, which was unsatisfactory.  The inventors of the present invention tried to trace the process of the above-mentioned literature, and as a result, found that the yield of the target compound was only 12%, a plurality of by-products were produced, and the resultant product mixture liquid exhibited a brown color (refer to Comparative Example 3 of the present application).  Also, it was confirmed that titanium tetrachloride, used for the process of the<br>
literature, was a chemically unstable compound to such an extent that this compound is decomposed by moisture in the atmospheric air, and thus complicated and meticulous care is needed in handling this compound.<br>
Further, the inventors of the present invention tried to apply the process of the literature to the reaction of 3,4-methylenedioxy benzene with an alkenylidene diacetate and found that the titanium tetrachloride activated by boron trifluoride-ether complex caused a decomposition reaction of 3,4-methylenedioxybenzene to be promoted, and the yield of the target compound was 43% and unsatisfactory (refer to Comparative Example 1 of the present application). Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention tried to effect the reaction by using titanium tetrachloride in an amount of 0.1 mole per mole of alkenylidene diacetate, to control or prevent the decomposition of 3,4-methylenedioxybenzene.  As a result, the yield of the target compound decreased to 9.8% (refer to Comparative Example 2 of the present application).<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 55-141437 discloses a process for producing l-acetoxy-2-methyl-3-(4-t-butylphenyl)propene by reacting t-butylbenzene with methacrolein and acetyl chloride in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of a Lewis acid.  In this process, when titanium tetrachloride was used as Lewis acid, the yield of the target compound was 46.2%, and when boron trifluoride-ether complex was employed as a Lewis acid, the yield of the target compound was 2.3%.  In each of the above-mentioned cases, the target compound yield was low and unsatisfactory. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

The resultant reaction liquid was diluted with acetonitrile and subjected to a quantitative analysis using a high performance liquid chromatography.  It was found that the target 1,-acetoxy-2-methyl-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propene was obtained in an amount of 4.15g in a yield of 94.2%. Example 30<br>
In an argon gas atmosphere, a three necked flask having a capacity of 25 ml was charged with a mixture of 7.04g (51.7 m moles) of 1,2-ethylenedioxybenzene having a purity degree of 97% by mass with 0.97g (5.0 m moles) of 3,3-diacetoxy-2-methylpropene having a purity degree of 89.2% by mass, and then the mixture was further mixed<br>
with 71 mg (0.5m mole) of boron trifluoride-ether complex at an internal temperature of 24°C.  The mixture<br>
was stirred at an internal temperature of 24°C for 2 hours.<br>
The resultant reaction liquid was mixed with 50 ml of ethyl acetate, and the resultant organic layer was washed twice with 50 ml of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed by distillation.  The distillation residue was subjected to a column chromatography on silica gel and treated with an eluting solvent:  ethyl acetate/n-hexane mixture in a mixing ratio by volume of 1/5.  The target l-acetoxy-2-methyl-3-(3,4-ethylenedioxyphenyl)propene in an oily state was obtained in an amount of 0.97g.  The isolation yield of the target compound was 78.2%.<br>
