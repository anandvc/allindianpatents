Purification method for effluent<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a filtration<br>
device for wastswater purification, preferably for a<br>
sewage treatment plant, to a sewage treatment plant<br>
having such a filtration device, to a method of<br>
purifying wastewater, in particular wastewater in a<br>
sewage treatment plant, and also to the use of a<br>
ceramic-based membrane for separating off<br>
microorganisms, and if appropriate, also fine solids,<br>
from wastewaters.<br>
[0002] In addition to screens and settling tanks<br>
which, in a first step, free wastewaters from coarse<br>
components, conventional sewage treatment plants also<br>
contain an activation tank and a secondary<br>
clarification tank. In the activation tank,<br>
microorganisms are used in order to decompose fecal<br>
matter or other organic substances. The microorganisms<br>
used are separated off again by sedimentation from the<br>
wastewater subsequently to the activation tank, in the<br>
secondary clarification tank and in part recirculated<br>
to the activation tank. Complete separation of the<br>
microorganisms is not possible by a sedimentation<br>
process, and therefore microorganisms which are harmful<br>
to health can sometimes pass into the environment<br>
together with the wastewater. European union directives<br>
for keeping water bodies clean, which guidelines have<br>
already been substantially converted to national<br>
legislation, however, prescribe on a Europe-wide basis<br>
that only biologically clarified wastewater which is<br>
essentially free from microorganisms may be allowed to<br>
drain off into the environment. The microorganisms are<br>
generally separated off by fine filters which reliably<br>
separate off microorganisms.<br>
[0003] In Germany, primarily in rural areas, in<br>
particular in eastern Germany, predominantly for<br><br>
technical or economic reasons, currently an estimated<br>
5.3 million people are not connected to the municipal<br>
wastewater grid. Those affected, as a consequence of<br>
said EU directives, had to be provided with facilities<br>
by December 31 2 0 05 either by connection to the<br>
municipal grid or by the operation of a small sewage<br>
treatment plant. This situation created a high demand<br>
for decentralized wastewater treatment plants which is<br>
maintained to date.<br>
[0004] Small sewage treatment plants are relatively<br>
widely distributed, which sewage treatment: plants<br>
consist, of a round concrete container which again is<br>
subdivided into three chambers (preliminary<br>
clarification/activation tank/secondary clarification).<br>
The preliminary clarification is used in order first to<br>
remove coarse components from the wastewater<br>
mechanically or by simple sedimentation. The coarse<br>
components which are separated off must be purrped off<br>
at regular time intervals. The activation tank contains<br>
microorganisms which perform the biological<br>
purification, the secondary clarification tank serves<br>
for separating off the microorganisms which have been<br>
introduced and their recirculation to the activation<br>
tank and/or to the preliminary clarification tank. This<br>
equipment can be supplemented, for example, by a<br>
compressor which feeds oxygen to the activation tank<br>
via a membrane tube aerator, and also a submersible<br>
motor pump for transporting the excess sludge.<br>
[0005] In an activation tank, in the course of time,<br>
excess clarified sludge forms which must be regularly<br>
drawn off by suction. Alternatively, what are termed<br>
moving-bed processes are also known in which the amount<br>
of excess sludge is generally drastically reduced. In<br>
contrast to the classical activation tank, in moving-<br>
bed processes, free-floating plastic bodies are<br>
employed which can fill up the activation tank<br><br>
virtually completely. Microorganisms are found in this<br>
case both on the plastic bodies and also freely<br>
suspended in the water.<br>
[0006] In recenz years, as a further development of<br>
the known moving-bed methods, increasingly what are<br>
known as WSB® methods (fluidized bed-moving bed-biofilm<br>
methods) have been able to become established. Such<br>
methods are described, for example, in DE 10127554 and<br>
also in DE 196 23 592. In these methods also, plastic<br>
bodies serve as carriers which can be colonized by the<br>
microorganisms. The microozrganisms in WSB® methods are<br>
however generally localized virtually completely on the<br>
carrier material. Whereas in fluidized-bed methods<br>
operations were originally carried out exclusively<br>
anaerobically (without aeration), in WSB® methods, as a<br>
result of the introduction of air, the plastic carriers<br>
colonized by microorganisms are optimally and uniformly<br>
distributed (or "fluidized") in the activated zone and<br>
are situated in the moving" suspension, which gave rise<br>
to the name Wirbel-Schwebe-Bett (WSB®) [fluidized bed-<br>
moving bed]. Even in the case of greatly varying<br>
inflow, e.g. in the holiday period, the biological<br>
system in the activation tank always remains intact.<br>
[0007] However, there is also the problem in the case<br>
of wastewater purification by a WSB® method that microorganisms<br>
are discharged into the environment, that is<br>
to say microbe-containing wastewater is introduced into<br>
the activated soil zone or into a receiving body of<br>
water.<br>
[0008] To avoid harmful microorganisms from being<br>
introduced into the activated soil zone and/or to<br>
enable treated wastewater to be able to be reused as<br>
service water, the wastewater must therefore be<br>
additionally filtered.<br><br>
[0009] For instance, DE 19807890 describes a sewage<br>
treatment plant, the wastewater of which is filtered<br>
through submerged microfiltration membranes in order to<br>
pass it thereafter into a service water reservoir and<br>
reuse it. DE 20315451 describes a microfiltration<br>
device as a retrofitting set for a small sewage<br>
treatment plant which is connected downstream of the<br>
activation tank but upstream of the actual outlet of<br>
the sewage treatment plant.<br>
[0010] In all cases here organic filter membranes are<br>
used which are arranged in a module form. However,<br>
organic filter membranes have the disadvantage that<br>
they can only be regenerated or chemically cleaned<br>
inadequately, so that all of these membranes must<br>
generally be renewed in relatively short time periods<br>
(
restricted mechanical stability, such that at<br>
relatively high liquid pressures, they can easily be<br>
damaged. The use of organic membranes becomes<br>
particularly serious in the abovementioned moving-bed<br>
methods, in particular in the WSB® method, since in<br>
these, as a result of the plastic carrier particles<br>
which can move freely in the activation tank,<br>
mechanical defects on the organic membrane can be<br>
caused as a result of which the low-stability organic<br>
filter membranes can be destroyed within a shore time.<br>
[0011] The use of filter membranes is in addition<br>
linked with the fundamental problem that during<br>
filtration, a covering layer is deposited on the outer<br>
surface of the membrane (what is termed fouling) which<br>
provides a resistance to the material to be filtered.<br>
This leads to a drastic reduction in filter performance<br>
to total blockage and therefore to total loss of the<br>
filter membrane.<br><br>
[0012] Detachment of this covering layer on the<br>
membrane requires regular cleaning. In this operation<br>
the permeate stream is reversed so that the previously<br>
filtered water is then pumped back through the filter<br>
membrane in the opposite direction (backwashing). As a<br>
result, the covering layer is at lease in part<br>
detached, as a result of which the efficiency of the<br>
filter performance is increased again for a certain<br>
time. However, this procedure generally requires<br>
separate equipment. In addition, cleaning is at the<br>
cose of losing already filtered water which greatly<br>
reduces the efficiency of the overall system.<br>
[0013] The object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a simple and inexpensive solution for purifying<br>
wastewaters. This solution shall focus, in particular,<br>
on separating off microorganisms contained in<br>
wasstewaters. Known prior art problems such as said<br>
destruction of filter membranes by biological or<br>
mechanical action or the blockage of membranes and<br>
resultant complex cleaning steps must be avoided as<br>
completely as possible.<br>
[0014] This object is achieved by the filtration<br>
appliance having the features of claim 1, the sewage<br>
treatment plant having the features of claim 15, the<br>
method having the features of claim 18 and also the use<br>
having the features of claim 23. Preferred embodiments<br>
of the filtration appliance according to the invention<br>
are shown in dependent claims 2 to 14. Dependent claims<br>
16 and 17 relate to preferred embodiments of the sewage<br>
treatment plant according to the invention. In<br>
subclaims 19 to 22 and 24, preferred embodiments of the<br>
method according to the invention and also of the use<br>
according to the invention are shown. The wording of<br>
all claims is hereby made a content of this description<br>
by reference.<br><br>
[0015] A filtration appliance according to the<br>
invention for wastewater purification is provided in<br>
particular for use in a sewage treatment plant, in<br>
particular in a small sewage treatment plant. It is<br>
distinguished in that it comprises at least one<br>
ceramic-based membrane for separating off<br>
microorganisms.<br>
[0016] A ceramic-based membrane is distinguished by<br>
resistance to biological or chemical action and also by<br>
high mechanical suability. In contrast to the organic<br>
filter membranes which are known from the prior art,<br>
which have been used to date in small sewage treatment<br>
plants, a filtration appliance according to the<br>
invention having a ceram:.c-based membrane may therefore<br>
be used without problems also in moving-bed methods, in<br>
particular also in small sewage treatment plants<br>
operated according to the WSB® method. It withstands<br>
without: problems the biological action caused by the<br>
microorganisms and at the same time reliably separates<br>
these off. Fine solids and suspended matter can if<br>
appropriate also be reliably separated off. Ac the same<br>
time, it is resistant to mechanical action, for example<br>
due to plastic carrier particles floating in the<br>
activation tank. This becomes particularly positively<br>
noticeable with respect to maintenance intervals and<br>
lifetime of the membrane.<br>
[0017] Preferably, a membrane of a filtration<br>
appliance according to the invention is a membrane<br>
plate made of a porous ceramic. In principle, the shape<br>
of the membrane plate may be freely chosen. For<br>
instance, round or rectangular membrane plates may be<br>
preferred, matched to the respective individual case.<br>
[0018] In a preferred embodiment the membrane plate<br>
has a coating. This preferably comprises at least one<br>
separation layer which consists at least in part, in<br><br>
some preferred embodiments, essentially completely, of<br>
nanoscale particles. Preferably, the separation layer<br>
has a fraction of nanoscale particles of at least 5% by<br>
weight;, particularly preferably of at least 25% by<br>
weight, in particular of at least 40% by weight.<br>
[0019] Nanoscale particles are taken to mean here<br>
particles having a median particle size of less than<br>
1 m, preferably less than 500 nm, in particular less<br>
than 10 0 nm, particularly preferably less than 50 nm.<br>
These size figures relate to values which were obtained<br>
by means of light-scattering experiments.<br>
[0020] According to the invention, the membrane plate<br>
coating mentioned may consist exclusively of the at<br>
least one separation layer. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the coating, however, further comprises at<br>
least one further porous layer which is arranged<br>
between the membrane plate and the at least one<br>
separation layer. The at least one separation layer is<br>
preferably the outer layer at which the microorganisms<br>
are essentially separated off.<br>
[0021] The coating situated on the membrane plates<br>
preferably has a thickness between 100 nm and 150 m,<br>
preferably between 500 nm and 100 m, in particular<br>
from approximately 25 m to 60 m. These values<br>
preferably also apply to the cases in which the coating<br>
consists of the at least one further porous layer and<br>
the at least one separation layer.<br>
[0022]	The thickness of the at least one separation<br>
layer	is preferably in the: range between 10 0 nm and<br>
75 m,	in particular in the range between 5 m and<br>
50 m,	in particular approximately 25 m.<br>
[0023] The thickness of the at least one further<br>
porous layer is preferably in the range between 100 nm<br><br>
and 75 m, in particular in the range between 5 m and<br>
50 m, in particular approximately 25 m.<br>
[0024] The porous ceramic of the membrane plate<br>
(substrate) has pores preferably having a diameter<br>
between 100 ran and 10 m, particularly preferably<br>
between 5 00 run and 6 m, in particular between 5 00 nm<br>
and 3 m.<br>
[0025] The at least one further porous layer has pores<br>
preferably having a diameter between 500 nm and 2 m,<br>
particularly preferably between 500 nm and 1 m, in<br>
particular between 600 nm and 900 nm.<br>
[0026] In the case of a membrane plate provided with<br>
at least one separation layer, in particular the pore<br>
size of the at least one separation layer is very<br>
important for separating off the microorganisms.<br>
Preferably, a separation layer has pores having a<br>
diameter between 1 nm and 1400 nm, more preferably<br>
between 50 nm and. 500 nm, in particular between 50 nm<br>
and 300 nm, particularly preferably between 2 00 nm and<br>
300 nm.<br>
[0027] The pore size of possibly underlying layers<br>
generally does not directly affect the separation of<br>
the microorganisms. However, it is preferred that<br>
underlying layers have larger pores than the separation<br>
layer. Particularly preferably, with respect to the<br>
pore size, there is a gradient to the outer separation<br>
layer. For instance, it is preferred that the pore<br>
sizes decrease towards the outside.<br>
[0028] In preferred embodiments having at least one<br>
further porous layer between the at least one<br>
separation layer and the membrane plate, the size of<br>
the pores of the at least one further porous layer is<br>
between the size of the pores of the separation layer<br><br>
(smallest pores sizes) and the size of the pores of the<br>
membrane plate (which has the largest pores) . This<br>
applies in particular to the mean values of pore sizes<br>
within the layers (since the pore size is frequently<br>
non-uniform within a layer, if appropriate overlapping<br>
with respect to the absolute pore sizes can occur, such<br>
that, for example, the size of the largest pores of the<br>
at least one separation layer can exceed the size of<br>
the smallest pores of the at least one further porous<br>
layer).<br>
[0029] The porous ceramic of the membrane plate is<br>
preferably a ceramic based on a metal oxide, in<br>
particular based on aluminum oxide. In addition to<br>
oxidic ceramics such as aluminum oxide ceramics, in<br>
further preferred embodiments, non-oxidic ceramics can<br>
also be used.<br>
[0030] The nanoparticles of the separation layer are<br>
preferably oxidic nanoparticles, in particular aluminum<br>
oxide particles. In addition, in particular, also nano-<br>
particles of zirconium dioxide or titanium dioxide or<br>
else mixtures of said oxidic nanoparticles can be<br>
preferred. For particularly thin separation layers, in<br>
particular zeolites are very highly suitable. In<br>
further preferred embodiments, the nanoparticles can<br>
also be non-oxidic nanoparticles.<br>
[0031] In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
filtration appliance according to the invention, the<br>
membrane plate has internally at least one channel for<br>
the outflow of purified wastewater. Preference,<br>
however, is given to a plurality of channels which are<br>
preferably arranged in parallel to one another which<br>
extend uniformly over the interior of the membrane<br>
plate.<br>
[0032] A filtration appliance as claimed in the<br><br>
present invention has preferably at least 2 membrane<br>
plates. Depending on the individual case, the number cf<br>
membrare plates can vary greatly. For instance, for<br>
purifying relatively small amounts of wastewater,<br>
filtration appliances having 3 to 15, in particular<br>
3-10, membrane plates can be preferred. If larger<br>
amounts of wastewater are produced, however, filtration<br>
appliances having several hundred membrane plates are<br>
also conceivable.<br>
[0033] A filtration appliance according to the<br>
invention has preferably a modular structure which<br>
enables the number of membrane plates to be varied in<br>
accordance with the respective requirements.<br>
[0034] In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
filtration appliance according to the invention, the at<br>
least 2 membrane plates are arranged essentially in<br>
parallel to one another. In this case it is further-<br>
preferred that the distance between a plurality of<br>
membrane plates which are arranged essentially in<br>
parallel to one another is essentially always the same.<br>
[0035] As has already been described, the shape of a<br>
membrane plate in a filtration appliance according to<br>
the invention can in principle be selected freely,<br>
depending on the individual case. The same applies in<br>
principle also to the dimensions of a membrane plate,<br>
wherein the length or width of a membrane plate<br>
generally does not exceed 150 cm. For instance, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, a rectangular membrane plate has<br>
a length of approximately 5 0 cm and a width of<br>
approximately 11 cm.<br>
[0036] The thickness of a membrane plate in a<br>
filtration appliance according to the invention is here<br>
generally preferably in the range between 0.15 mm and<br>
20 mm, in particular between 0.5 mm and 10 mm. In a<br><br>
particularly preferred embodiment, a membrane place has<br>
a thickness of approximately 6 mm.<br>
[0037] A sewage treatment plant according to the<br>
invention is distinguished in that it has at least one<br>
filtration appliance as claimed in the present<br>
invention. Preferably, a sewage treatment plant<br>
according to the invention is a small sewage treatment<br>
plant, in particular having a purification output for 1<br>
to 5000 persons (up to a resident figure of 5000).<br>
[0038] The filtration device according to the<br>
invention has already been adequately explained. The<br>
corresponding parts of the description are hereby<br>
explicitly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0039] Preferably, a sewage treatment plant as claimed<br>
in the present invention has at least one activation<br>
tank for wastewater. In this the wastewater is<br>
biologically purified by microorganisms.<br>
[0040] In a further preferred embodiment of the sewage<br>
treatment plant according to the invention, at least<br>
one secondary clarification tank for wastewater is<br>
connected downstream of the at least one activation<br>
tank.<br>
[0041] A filtration device according to the invention<br>
can in this case be connected not only directly to an<br>
activation tank but also to a secondary clarification<br>
tank.<br>
[0042] As has already been mentioned, the present<br>
invention also comprises a method of purifying<br>
wastewater, in particular in a sewage treatment plant.<br>
This is distinguished in that microorganisms situated<br>
in the wastewater are separated off by means of at<br>
least one ceramic-based membrane.<br><br>
[0043] The method according to the invention<br>
preferably comprises a biological purification of the<br>
wastewater by microorganisms in ac least one activation<br>
tank.<br>
[0044] In a further preferred embodiment a method as<br>
claimed in the present invention comprises a secondary<br>
clarification of the wastewater in at least one<br>
secondary clarification tank.<br>
[0045] The present invention likewise relates to the<br>
use of a ceramic-based membrane as filter for<br>
separating off microorganisms from wastewaters.<br>
[0046] In a preferred embodiment of the use according<br>
to the invention, the ceramic-based membrane is a<br>
membrane plate made of a porous ceramic -which is<br>
provided with an, if appropriate, multilayer coating<br>
which comprises a separation layer which consists at<br>
least in part of nanoscale particles.<br>
[0047] Not only the membrane plate, but also the<br>
coating comprising the separation layer have been<br>
described in the context of the explanations of the<br>
filtration appliance according to the invention. Here<br>
also, correspondingly, reference is made to the<br>
relevant parts of the description.<br>
[0048] The above and other advantages of the invention<br>
will become apparent from the description of the<br>
following example and the figures in combination with<br>
the subclaims. The individual features of the invention<br>
can be implemented each alone or in combination with<br>
one another. The examples and figures serve only for<br>
illustration and for better understanding of the<br>
invention and are in no way to be understood as being<br>
restrictive.<br>
[0049] In the figures:<br><br>
Fig. I: shows on the left: membrane places for a<br>
preferred embodiment of the filtration device<br>
according to the invention having channels for<br>
conducting away purified water. In each case<br>
the exits of a plurality of channels in the<br>
membranes which are arranged in parallel to one<br>
another may be seen. The channels serve for<br>
conducting away the purified wastewater.<br>
On the right: microscopic detail of a cross<br>
section through a membrane plate which is<br>
suitable according to the invention. In the<br>
lower region (dark) the relatively coarse-grained<br>
structure of the porous ceramic of the<br>
membrane plate may be seen. At the top (light)<br>
the significantly finer structure of a thin<br>
coating (here only consisting of a separation<br>
layer) on the porous ceramic may be seen.<br>
Fig. 2: shows an SEM image of a section through a<br>
membrane plate which is suitable according to<br>
the invention. Three layers may be seen, namely<br>
on the left the separation layer, in the center<br>
a further porous layer and on the right a<br>
membrane plate made of a porous ceramic. The<br>
layers and the membrane plate itself each<br>
consist of aluminum oxide. The separation layer<br>
and the further porous layer each have a<br>
thickness of approximately 25 m. The thickness<br>
of the membrane plate is up to 3.25 mm. The<br>
pore size decreases toward the separation layer<br>
from 4 000 to 6000 nm (membrane plate) through<br>
approximately 800 nm (central further porous<br>
layer) to approximately 200 nm (separation<br>
layer).<br><br>
Fig. 3: shows a filtration appliance according to the<br>
invention having ten membrane places arranged<br>
in parallel to one another.<br>
Example<br>
[0050] In a long-terrr. experiment, a study was made of<br>
how stably a filtration appliance according to the<br>
invention behaves on operation (moving-bed method). In<br>
this study moldings made of plastic (K1 Biofiim Carrier<br>
Elements from Kaldness, 3103 T0nsberg, Norway) were<br>
constantly in contact with the membrane of a filtration<br>
appliance according to the invention. Even after a<br>
plurality of weeks, however, neither damage nor wear of<br>
the membrane could be observed, and the membrane<br>
throughput was also very satisfactory.<br><br>
