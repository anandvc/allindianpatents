APPLICANT<br>
Galaxy Surfactants Ltd.,<br>
C-49/2, TTC Industrial Area, Pawne, Navi-Mumbai 400 703, Maharashtra, India.<br>
A Public Limited Company Registered under Indian Company's Act - 1956<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
940/MUM/2000<br><br><br>
Field of Invention :<br>
This invention relates to compositions containing cinnamidoalkylamiine bis-quaternary salts. More particularly this invention relates to compositions containing water-soluble cirmamidoalkylamine bis-quaternary salts of Formula I manufactured by the process described in Indian Patent Appln. No. 903 / Mum / 2000, filed on the same day as the patent application. Compositions of the present invention give protection from UV-radiation to skin, hair and textile because of the substantive nature of said UV-absorbing compounds of Formula I.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
The harmful effects of solar UV-radiation are well known. The UV-B (290 - 320 nm) portion of solar spectrum is largely responsible for erythema (sunburn) and cancer. [M. M. Rieger, Cosmet. Toiletries, 102 (3), 91, (1987); L. Taylor, Skin Cancer Foundation J., 4, (90) (1986)].<br>
Similarly, photodegradative effect of UV-radiation on human hair is well documented. Continuous exposure to sunrays makes human hair rough and brittle, difficult to comb and lighten hair color. UV rays are reported to damage the proteins of cuticles. Prolonged irradiation results in diminished tensile strength. [R. Beyak et al, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 22, 667 - 668 (1971), E. Hoting et al, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem 46, 85-99 (1995)]<br>
In addition, UV light is also known to fade garments [P. C. Screws, Text. Chem. Color, 11, 21 (1987); B. Milligan et al, Polym Degrad. Stab. 10 (4), 335 (1985)].<br>
A number of UV-absorbing compounds like derivatives of salicylic acid, benzophenones, benzotriazoles, cinnamic acid have been used in personal care products. However, all these molecules suffered from a major disadvantage of lack of substantivity. To make this UV-absorbing moieties more substantive, structural modification have been introduced [US patent 3,879,443 (1975), 3,878,229 (1975), 4,061,730 (1977), 4,069,309 (1978), 4,680,144 (1987), 4,256,664 (1981)]. Two very recent patents [US patent 5,427,773 (1995) and US patent 5,601,811 (1997)] disclose cationic photofilters. The cationic nature of such molecules gives substantivity to skin, hair and fibres of cotton and wool.<br>
US patent 5,427,773 (1995) discloses substantive photofilters like dodecyl dimethyl amino benzamido propyl dimethyl ammonium tosylate. The cationic nature of such molecules gives the substantivity to hair surface and are claimed to increase softness of feel by having long alkyl chain. The efficacy of such photoprotective agents have been evaluated and shown to be effective in a variety of formulations for hair care that include, conditioning rinses, shampoos, hair spray, hair styling mousse. However, the sunscreening agents described in this patent are water-insoluble.<br>
The US patent 5,601,811 (1997) describes substantive UV-absorbing cinnamidoamine cationic quaternary salts and product compositions for detergents, household cleaners and hair and skin personal care products.<br>
2<br><br>
Water solubility of such molecules is very important for proper delivery and / or uniform distribution of these molecules on the skin and hair. That would also reduce use of many different compounds in one formulation for imparting each functional property desired. Substantive water-soluble compounds can be formulated in oil-free compositions so that the greasy-feel of cosmetic preparations based on hydrophobic carrier can be avoided.<br>
Thus, there is a need to for designing compositions that would effectively deliver / deposit the substantive UV-absorbing molecule on to the surface of skin, hair and fibre.<br>
Object of the Invention :<br>
The principle object of the present invention is to develop a UV-B protection compositions for personal care and fabric care.<br>
A group of new molecules which are capable of providing UV-B protection and which are water-soluble is described in our accompanying Indian Patent Appln. No. 903 / Mum / 2000, the main object of the present invention is to develop UV-B protection compositions particularly for skin, hair and textiles based on substantivity of these molecules.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is to develop UV-B protection compositions, particularly for skin such as soaps, shampoos, creams and lotions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop UV-B protection compositions, particularly for textiles and more particularly for garments, such as detergent powders, liquids, whiteners, blues, rinse solutions, etc. in hand machine wash products.<br>
Summary of the Invention :<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to skin care, hair care and fabric care compositions comprising at least one of cinnamidoalkylamine cationic to-quaternary compounds of general Formula I, as,<br>

Water was added to the mixture if necessary to adjust the weight to 200.0 g and stirring was continued to get uniform detergent powder.<br>
Example V<br>
Measurement of substantivity (The dye test)<br>
A 2 % w/w active solution of Bis-Quat was prepared and was evaluated for hair substantivity.<br>
1)	Bleached hair tresses were washed with 10 % sodium lauryl sulphate solution and rinsed with copious amount of water.<br>
2)	The washed hair tresses were then immersed for 60 seconds in a solution of 0.5 % w/w Solar Red 5B1 dye p-(p-aminophenylazo)benzenesulphonic acid-N-benzoyl-J-acid from Clariant in water pH adjusted to 2.5 with sulphuric acid. The hair tresses were removed and washed with water.<br>
3)	Simultaneously bleached and washed hair were treated with 2.0 % solution of Bis-Quat for 5 minutes. The treated hair tresses were washed with water and then immersed in 0.5 % solution of Solar Red 5B1 dye for 60 seconds and removed and rinsed with water.<br>
13<br><br>
The control did not pick up the dye whereas the hair tresses treated with Bis-Quat were appreciably red. This is attributable to dye adsorption. The fact that the dye was adsorbed onto Bis-Quat treated hair tresses and not to the control tresses proves that the product is substantive to hair.<br>
Example VI<br>
Measurement of Substantivity (in shampoos)<br>
Virgin hair (5.0 g) were washed with 10 % SLES solution and rinsed with plain water. The tresses were treated for exactly 5.0 minutes with clear shampoo (containing 2 % Bis-Quat) that was diluted five times with water. After the treatment the tresses were washed thoroughly with copious amount of water. The adsorbed quaternary was extracted from the hair surface by immersing each tress in isopropanol at 65°C for 30 minutes. A known volume of this isopropanol / Bis-Quat mixture was analysed by UV-spectroscopy to determine its absorption intensity.<br>
The substantivity was found to be 22 mg /100 g of hair.<br>
An exactly identical experiment performed on washed hair with 1000 ppm aqueous solution of Bis-Quat showed the substantivity to be 104 mg /100 g of hair.<br>
Example VII<br>
Measurement of substantivity (in detergent powder)<br>
A piece of cotton fabric (5.0 g) was washed with detergent solution and rinsed with water. It was then treated with detergent powder (5.0 g in 200 ml water) of Example IV for 15 minutes. The cotton fabric was then removed and washed thoroughly with water. The adsorbed quaternary was then extracted from the cotton fibres by immersing in isopropanol at 65°C for 30 minutes. A known volume of this isopropanol / bis-quaternary was analysed by UV spectroscopy to determine its absorption.<br>
The substantivity on cotton fabric was found to be 21 mg /100 g of cotton fabric.<br>
An exactly identical experiment performed on a piece of cotton fabric using 1000 ppm solution of aqueous Bis-Quat showed the substantivity to be 124 mg /100 g of cotton fabric.<br>
The soap, detergent, skin care and hair care compositions comprising of one or more active ingredients and a cinnamidoalkylamine to-quaternary salt that is described by the Formula I substantially as described in the text and in the Example I, II, III and IV.<br>
14<br><br>
Advantages of the invention :<br>
1.	Compounds of Formula I, highly substantive and strong UV-absorbing molecules have been incorporated in formulations / compositions which are useful in preventing damaging effect of UV-B radiation on the skin and hair for longer period, even if they are applied in the form of 'rinse-off applications like shampoos and soaps.<br>
2.	The molecules of Formula I, have strong UV absorbance with e of 42,726 cm2/mol at Amax 292 nm. High substantivity for compounds of Formula I has been established. The substantivity experiment on hair when performed in a shampoo formulation, bis-quaternaries have keen found to be superior to the molecules from the prior art. This superior substantivity of the compounds of Formula I could be attributed to two cationic centres as against just one in commercially available molecules from the prior art. The surface activity of these molecules may aid in enhancing the adhesion to hair and skin. Unlike the UV-absorbers of the prior art, the compounds" of Formula I, do not have any labile or hydrolyzable linkage and hence are chemically stable molecules. None of the ingredient of personal care or fabric care formulation showed any incompatibility with the bis-quaternaries of Formula I. Despite being cationic molecules they can be formulated in preparations containing anionic surfactants. Being water soluble these molecules offer ease of formulation, obviating the use of hydrophobic bases that result in oily and greasy feel. Additionally, the antimicrobial properties of these molecules help preserve formulations and they can have synergistic effect with other preservatives.<br>
