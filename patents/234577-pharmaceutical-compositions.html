The aforementioned examples of possible doses applicable for the combinations according to the invention are to be understood as referring to doses per single application. However, these examples are not be understood as excluding the possibility of administering the combinations according to the invention multiple times. Depending on the medical need patients may receive also multiple inhalative applications. As an example patients may receive the combinations according to the invention for instance two or three times (e.g. two or three puffs with a powder inhaler, an MDI etc) in the morning of each treatment<br>
day. As the aforementioned dose examples are only to be understood as dose examples per single application (i.e. per puff) multiple application of the combinations according to the invention leads to multiple doses of the aforementioned examples. The application of the combositions according to the invention can be for instance once a day, or depending on the duration of action of the anticholinergic agent twice a day, or once every 2 or 3 days.<br>
Moreover it is emphazised that the aforementioned dose examples are to be understood as examples of metered doses only. In other terms, the aforementioned dose examples are not to be understood as the effective doses of the combinations according to the invention that do in fact reach the lung. It is clear for the person of ordinary skill in the art that the delivered dose to the lung is generally lower than the metered dose of the administered active ingredients.<br>
The active substance combinations of 1. and 2 according to the invention are preferably administered by inhalation. For this purpose, ingredients 1 and 2 have to be made available in forms suitable for inhalation. Inhalable preparations according to the invention include inhalable powders, propellant-containing metered dose aerosols or propellant-free inhalable solutions. Inhalable powders according to the invention containing the combination of active substances 1 and 2 may consist of the active substances on their own or of a mixture of the active substances with physiologically acceptable excipients. Within the scope of the present invention, the term carrier may optionally be used instead of the term excipient. Within the scope of the present invention, the term propellant-free inhalable solutions also includes concentrates or sterile inhalable solutions ready for use. The preparations according to the invention may contain the combination of active substances 1 and 2 either together in one formulation or in two separate formulations. These formulations which may be used within the scope of the<br>
present invention are described in more detail in the next part of the specification.<br>

particularly suitable organic acids include ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is also possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid are preferred. If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the PH.<br>
According to the invention, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium editate, as stabiliser or complexing agent is unnecessary in the present formulation. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these compounds. In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium editate is less than lOOmg/lOOml, preferably less than 50mg/100 ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100 ml. Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium editate is from 0 to lOmg/lOOml are preferred.<br>
Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention. Preferred co-solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols - particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the pharmacologically suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active substance formulation: Preferably, these substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents.<br>
The preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body.<br>
Preservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50mg/100ml, more preferably between 5 and 20mg/100ml.<br>
Preferred formulations contain, in addition to the solvent water and the combination of active substances 1 and 2, only benzalkonium chloride and sodium editate. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium editate is present.<br>
The propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention are administered in particular using inhalers of the kind which are capable of nebulising a small amount of a liquid formulation in the therapeutic dose within a few seconds to produce an aerosol suitable for therapeutic inhalation. Within the scope of the present invention, preferred inhalers are those in which a quantity of less than lOOuX, preferably less than 50|.iL, more preferably between 20 and 30uL of active substance solution can be nebulised in preferably one spray action to form an aerosol with an average particle size of less than 20(.im, preferably less than lOum, in such a way that the inhalable part of the aerosol corresponds to the therapeutically effective quantity.<br>
An apparatus of this kind for propellant-free delivery of a metered quantity of a liquid pharmaceutical composition for inhalation is described for example in International Patent Application WO 91/14468 and also in WO-97/12687 (cf. in particular Figures 6a and 6b). The nebulisers (devices) described therein are known by the name Respimat®. This nebuliser (Respimat®) can advantageously be used to produce the inhalable aerosols according to the invention containing the combination of active substances 1 and 2. Because of its cylindrical shape and handy size of less than 9 to 15 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, this device can be carried at all times by the patient. The nebuliser sprays a defined volume of pharmaceutical formulation using high pressures through small nozzles so as to produce inhalable aerosols.<br>
The preferred atomiser essentially consists of an upper housing part, a pump housing, a nozzle, a locking mechanism, a spring housing, a spring and a storage container, characterised by<br>
-	a pump housing which is secured in the upper housing part and which comprises at<br>
one end a nozzle body with the nozzle or nozzle arrangement,<br>
-	a hollow plunger with valve body,<br>
-	a power takeoff flange in which the hollow plunger is secured and which is located<br>
in the upper housing part,<br>
a locking mechanism situated in the upper housing part,<br>
-	a spring housing with the spring contained therein, which is rotatably mounted on<br>
the upper housing part by means of a rotary bearing,<br>
-	a lower housing part which is fitted onto the spring housing in the axial direction.<br>
The hollow plunger with valve body corresponds to a device disclosed in WO 97/12687. It projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing and is axially movable within the cylinder. Reference is made in particular to Figures 1 to 4, especially Figure 3, and the relevant parts of the description. The hollow plunger with valve body exerts a pressure of 5 to 60 Mpa (about 50 to 600 bar), preferably 10 to 60 Mpa (about 100 to 600 bar) on the fluid, the measured amount of active substance solution, at its high pressure end at the moment when the spring is actuated. Volumes of 10 to 50 microlitres are preferred, while volumes of 10 to 20 microlitres are particularly preferred and a volume of 15 microlitres per spray is most particularly preferred.<br>
The valve body is preferably mounted at the end of the hollow plunger facing the valve body.<br>
The nozzle in the nozzle body is preferably microstructured, i.e. produced by microtechnology. Microstructured nozzle bodies are disclosed for example in WO 94/07607; reference is hereby made to the contents of this specification, particularly Figure 1 therein and the associated description.<br>
The nozzle body consists for example of two sheets of glass and/or silicon firmly joined together, at least one of which has one or more microstructured channels which connect the nozzle inlet end to the nozzle outlet end. At the nozzle outlet end there is at least one<br>
round or non-round opening 2 to 10 microns deep and 5 to 15 microns wide, the depth preferably being 4.5 to 6.5 microns while the length is preferably 7 to 9 microns. In the case of a plurality of nozzle openings, preferably two, the directions of spraying of the nozzles in the nozzle body may extend parallel to one another or may be inclined relative to one another in the direction of the nozzle opening. In a nozzle body with at least two nozzle openings at the outlet end the directions of spraying may be at an angle of 20 to 160° to one another, preferably 60 to 150°, most.preferably 80 to 100°. The nozzle openings are preferably arranged at a spacing of 10 to 200 microns, more preferably at a spacing of 10 to 100 microns, most preferably 30 to 70 microns. Spacings of 50 microns are most preferred. The directions of spraying will therefore meet in the vicinity of the nozzle openings.<br>
The liquid pharmaceutical preparation strikes the nozzle body with an entry pressure of up to 600 bar, preferably 200 to 300 bar, and is atomised into an inhalable aerosol through the nozzle openings. The preferred particle or droplet sizes of the aerosol are up to 20 microns, preferably 3 to 10 microns.<br>
The locking mechanism contains a spring, preferably a cylindrical helical compression spring, as a store for the mechanical energy. The spring acts on the power takeoff flange as an actuating member the movement of which is determined by the position of a locking member. The travel of the power takeoff flange is precisely limited by an upper and lower stop. The spring is preferably biased, via a power step-up gear, e.g. a helical thrust gear, by an external torque which is produced when the upper housing part is rotated counter to the spring housing in the lower housing part. In this case, the upper housing part and the power takeoff flange have a single or multiple V-shaped gear.<br>
The locking member with engaging locking surfaces is arranged in a ring around the power takeoff flange. It consists, for example, of a ring of plastic or metal which is inherently radially elastically deformable. The ring is arranged in a plane at right angles to the atomiser axis. After the biasing of the spring, the locking surfaces of the locking member move into the path of the power takeoff flange and prevent the spring from relaxing. The locking member is actuated by means of a button. The actuating button is connected or coupled to the locking member. In order to actuate the locking mechanism, the actuating button is moved parallel to the annular plane, preferably into the atomiser; this causes the<br>
deformable ring to deform in the annular plane. Details of the construction of the locking mechanism are given in WO 97/20590.<br>
The lower housing part is pushed axially over the spring housing and covers the mounting, the drive of the spindle and the storage container for the fluid. When the atomiser is actuated the upper housing part is rotated relative to the lower housing part, the lower housing part taking the spring housing with it. The spring is thereby compressed and biased by means of the helical thrust gear and the locking mechanism engages automatically. The angle of rotation is preferably a whole-number fraction of 360 degrees, e.g. 180 degrees. At the same time as the spring is biased, the power takeoff part in the upper housing part is moved along by a given distance, the hollow plunger is withdrawn inside the cylinder in the pump housing, as a result of which some of the fluid is sucked out of the storage container and into the high pressure chamber in front of the nozzle.<br>
If desired, a number of exchangeable storage containers which contain the fluid to be atomised may be pushed into the atomiser one after another and used in succession. The storage container contains the aqueous aerosol preparation according to the invention. The atomising process is initiated by pressing gently on the actuating button. As a result, the locking mechanism opens up the path for the power takeoff member. The biased spring pushes the plunger into the cylinder of the pump housing. The fluid leaves the nozzle of the atomiser in atomised form.<br>
Further details of construction are disclosed in PCT Applications WO 97/12683 and WO 97/20590, to which reference is hereby made.<br>
The components of the atomiser (nebuliser) are made of a material which is suitable for its purpose. The housing of the atomiser and, if its operation permits, other parts as well, are preferably made of plastics, eg. by injection moulding. For medicinal purposes, physiologically safe materials are used.<br>
Figures 6a/b of WO 97/12687, show the nebuliser (Respimat®) which can advantageously be used for inhaling the aqueous aerosol preparations according to the invention. Figure 6a of WO 97/12687 shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring biased while Figure 6b of WO 97/12687 shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring relaxed.<br>
The upper housing part (51) contains the pump housing (52) on the end of which is mounted the holder (53) for the atomiser nozzle. In the holder is the nozzle body (54) and a filter (55). The hollow plunger (57) fixed in the power takeoff flange (56) of the locking mechanism projects partially into the cylinder of the -pump housing. At its end the hollow plunger carries the valve body (58). The hollow plunger is sealed off by means of the seal (59). Inside the upper housing part is the stop (60) on which the power takeoff flange abuts when the spring is relaxed. On the power takeoff flange is the stop (61) on which the power takeoff flange abuts when the spring is biased. After the biasing of the spring the locking member (62) moves between the stop (61) and a support (63) in the upper housing part. The actuating button (64) is connected to the locking member. The upper housing part ends in the mouthpiece (65) and is sealed off by means of the protective cover (66) which can be placed thereon.<br>
The spring housing (67) with compression spring (68) is rotatably mounted on the upper housing part by means of the snap-in lugs (69) and rotary bearing. The lower housing part (70) is pushed over the spring housing. Inside the spring housing is the exchangeable storage container (71) for the fluid (72) which is to be atomised. The storage container is sealed off by the stopper (73) through which the hollow plunger projects into the storage container and is immersed at its end in the fluid (supply of active substance solution). The spindle (74) for the mechanical counter is mounted in the covering of the spring housing. At the end of the spindle facing the upper housing part is the drive pinion (75). The slider (76) sits on the spindle.<br>
The nebuliser described above is suitable for nebulising the aerosol preparations according to the invention to produce an aerosol suitable for inhalation. If the formulation according to the invention is nebulised using the method described above (Respimat®) the quantity delivered should correspond to a defined quantity with a tolerance of not more than 25%, preferably 20% of this amount in at least 97%, preferably at least 98% of all operations of the inhaler (spray actuations). Preferably, between 5 and 30 mg of formulation, most preferably between 5 and 20 mg of formulation are delivered as a defined mass on each actuation.<br>
However, the formulation according to the invention may also be nebulised by means of inhalers other than those described above, e.g. jet stream inhalers or other stationary nebulisers.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions as described above combined with a device suitable for administering these formulations, preferably in conjunction with the Respimat®. Preferably, the invention relates to propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions characterised by the combination of active substances 1 and 2 according to the invention in conjunction with the device known by the name Respimat®.
