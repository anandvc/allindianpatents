				<td>A SOUND SYSTEM ASSEMBLY FOR USE IN A HAND HELD<br>
DEVICE AND A METHOD FOR REPRODUCING A STEREO<br>
AUDIO IMAGE IN A HAND HELD DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sound system assembly for use in a<br>
hand held device and a method for reproducing a stereo audio image in a hand<br>
held device and, more particularly, to sound system assemblies for producing<br>
stereo audio imaging including manifolds for porting the generated sound out of<br>
the device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As opposed to mono audio recording, stereo audio recording and playback has<br>
been used to provide a richer audible user experience. In stereo audio recording, a<br>
music signal is mixed into "left" and "right" signals, so that when played through a<br>
pair of speakers spaced a nominal distance apart, the listener perceives a sound field,<br>
that offers the illusion of instruments placed in actual locations on a virtual stage. In<br>
human hearing, the brain determines the apparent location of an event, like the<br>
apparent placement of individual instruments, based upon the arrival time, subtle<br>
frequency response differences and intensity of the sound waves that reach each of the<br>
listener's ears. The quality and realism of a stereo audio image experienced by the<br>
listener is dependent upon the design and quality of the speakers used for playback,<br>
and the location of the speakers, relative to the listener.<br>
In recent years, several software programs have been used to enhance and add<br>
greater three dimensional effects to ordinary stereo, through computations and<br>
manipulations of the individual sound signals, in some cases using digital signal<br>
processing techniques. However, regardless of the method used to create or enhance<br>
a stereo audio signal, the spacing of the speakers, relative to the listener, remains a<br>
major factor in the quality of the stereo image experienced by the listener.<br>
For many handheld type devices, like wireless communication devices, there<br>
is a trend toward smaller devices. Smaller devices are easier to carry on one's self,<br>
where the smaller the device, the greater the number of options for the location where<br>
the user can store the device (i.e a pocket, a belt clip, a small hand bag, etc.).<br>
However, as the device size decreases, so does the volume and surface area of the<br>
device, within and upon which the components can be located, which the user uses to<br>
interface with the device. For example, displays, microphones, speakers and keypads<br>
have external interfaces that are generally located at various positions around the<br>
external surface of the device, where they are conveniently accessible by the user, and<br>
are coupled to corresponding components internal to the device.<br>
When adding stereo playback capability to a wireless communication device<br>
or other hand held portable electronic device, the placement of the right and left<br>
speaker is constrained by the overall size of the device, resulting in a relatively close<br>
spacing of the two speaker elements. For a wireless communication device the<br>
problem is further frustrated by the typical aspect ratio of hand held devices, which<br>
are narrower in the horizontal direction and taller in the vertical direction. This is due<br>
to the fact, that the speakers need to be generally separated in the horizontal direction,<br>
which corresponds to the listener's ears, which are similarly displaced from one<br>
another in a generally horizontal direction.<br>
Still further the depth of the device, or distance between the front: facing of the<br>
device and the back facing of the device, is relatively shallow, as compared to both<br>
the height and the width of the device. As a result, in prior hand held devices, the<br>
speakers or transducers, have been oriented with the plane of their front facing<br>
parallel to the front facing of the device. Traditionally, in these instances, the sound<br>
from the speakers has been ported directly out of the device in a direction of travel<br>
that is generally perpendicular to the front facing of the speakers. However given the<br>
necessary diameter of many speakers, this has resulted in the output ports for the<br>
speakers being further limited in their horizontal displacement. For example, a 40mm<br>
wide cellular telephone, incorporating a pair of 18mm diameter transducers, would<br>
have their acoustic centers separated by approximately 19mm. Such a distance would<br>
limit the quality of a stereo image.<br>
The present inventors have recognized, that if instead of directly porting the<br>
sound from the speakers in a direction that is perpendicular to the front facing of the<br>
device, the sound waves produced by the speakers are directed away from the front or<br>
back facing of the device, toward alternative ones of the two opposing side facings of<br>
the device. In this way the location of the ports, which are now located proximate<br>
alternative side edges of the device, becomes the apparent source of the respective<br>
audio signals, thereby maximizing the apparent relative horizontal displacement of the<br>
right and left audio sources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a sound system assembly for use in a hand<br>
held device, which has a front facing, a back facing and two opposing side facings.<br>
The sound system assembly includes a first transducer and a second transducer, and a<br>
first manifold and a second manifold. The first transducer produces sound waves, and<br>
has a front facing, which is directed substantially toward one of the front facing and<br>
the back facing of the hand held device. The second transducer similarly produces<br>
sound waves, and has a front facing, which is directed substantially toward one of the<br>
front facing and the back facing of the hand held device.<br>
The first manifold has a first opening aligned with the front facing of the first<br>
transducer, a second opening aligned with a first one of the two opposing side facings<br>
of the hand held device, and a path therebetween, which couples the first opening to<br>
the second opening. The path redirects the sound waves produced, by the first<br>
transducer away from the front or back facing, that the front facing of the first<br>
transducer is directed toward, toward the first one of the two opposing side facings.<br>
The second manifold has a first opening aligned with the front facing of the<br>
second transducer, a second opening aligned with a second one of the two opposing<br>
side facings of the hand held device, and a path therebetween, which couples the first<br>
opening to the second opening. The path redirects the sound waves produced by the<br>
second transducer away from the front or back facing, that the front facing of the<br>
second transducer is directed toward, toward the second one of the two opposing side<br>
facings.<br>
In at least one embodiment, the sound waves produced by the transducers are<br>
redirected in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel of<br>
the sound waves, when the sound waves are originally produced by the corresponding<br>
transducer.<br>
In at least a further embodiment, the second opening of each of the manifolds<br>
is a slot having a slot length that is larger than the contact surface of a user's finger,<br>
such that if the user's finger covers any portion of the slot, the user's finger does not<br>
cover the entire slot.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of reproducing a stereo audio<br>
image in a hand held device, which has a pair of transducers ported out of the device<br>
via a pair of corresponding manifolds having a first opening aligned with the<br>
respective one of the pair of transducers and a second opening aligned with an<br>
exterior surface of the hand held device. The method includes producing a sound<br>
. wave at a first transducer having a front facing directed toward one of a front and<br>
back facing of the hand held device toward which the sound wave produced by the<br>
first transducer initially propagates. The direction of travel of the sound wave<br>
produced by the first transducer is then redirected away from the one of the front and<br>
back facing of the hand held device toward an exterior side surface of the hand held<br>
device via a first manifold.<br>
The method further includes producing a sound wave at a second transducer<br>
having a front facing directed toward one of a front, and back facing of the hand held<br>
device toward which the sound wave produced by the second transducer initially<br>
propagates. The direction of travel of the sound wave produced by the second<br>
transducer is then redirected away from the one of the front and back facing of the<br>
hand held device toward an exterior side surf ace of the hand held device via a second<br>
manifold, which is opposite to the exterior side surface through which the sound wave<br>
produced by the first transducer is redirected.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms,<br>
there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described presently preferred<br>
embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an<br>
exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the<br>
specific embodiments illustrated.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a perspective view of a hand held device 100, in accordance<br>
with at least one embodiment of the present invention. The hand held device 100<br>
includes a keypad 102 having multiple keys, which can be selectively actuated. The<br>
hand held device 100 additionally includes a display 104 for visually presenting<br>
information to a user, and at least a pair of speaker ports 106, only one of which is<br>
shown in FIG. 1. The display 104 and the keypad 102 are located at a front facing<br>
108 of the hand held device 100. Each one of the pair of speaker ports 106 are<br>
located on alternate side facings 110 of the hand held device. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the speaker ports are sized and shaped as slots, which extend partially<br>
along the length of the respective side facings 110.<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate perspective cross sectional views of the hand held<br>
device illustrated in FIG. 1, in accordance with at least two alternative embodiments.<br>
The cross sectional views are taken along sectional lines, illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
Generally, each of the alternative embodiments, illustrate at least a portion of a sound<br>
system assembly including a partial view of a pair of transducers 112,114, and a pair<br>
of manifolds 116,118. In each of the illustrated embodiments, the front facing of the<br>
transducers is substantially parallel with the front 108 and back 120 facings of the<br>
hand held device 100. The orientation of the transducers 112, 114 facilitates the<br>
production of sound waves that propagate, at least initially, in a direction that is<br>
substantially perpendicular 122 to the front 108 and back 120 facings of the device<br>
100. The transducers 112, 114 illustrated in FIG. 2 have a front facing, which faces<br>
toward the back facing 120 of the device 110, and the transducers 112, 114 illustrated<br>
in FIG. 3 have a front facing, which faces toward the front facing 108 of the device<br>
110. Correspondingly, the transducers 112, 114 produce sound waves in a direction<br>
consistent with the direction that the transducers 112,114 are facing.<br>
In the illustrated embodiments, the manifolds 116, 118 include a first opening,<br>
which corresponds to the front facing of a respective one of the transducers 112, 114,<br>
and a second opening, which aligns with a respective one of the ports 106 located at<br>
the exterior side surface 110 of the hand held device 100. The first opening of each<br>
manifold 116, 118 is coupled to the second opening 106 of the respective manifold<br>
116, 118 via a path extending between the two openings. The manifold 116, 118 is<br>
shaped so as to redirect the sound waves, produced by the transducers 112, 114 and<br>
received at the first opening, away from the corresponding one of the front 108 and<br>
back 120 facings of the device 100 toward the respective second opening 106 located<br>
in a corresponding one of the two opposing side facings 110 of the device 100.<br>
In the illustrated embodiments, the manifold 112, 114 is "L"-shaped having<br>
two legs, where one leg is oriented substantially perpendicular to the other leg. The<br>
first leg has a cross sectional area proximate in shape and slightly smaller than the<br>
front facing of the transducer 112, 114, which in the illustrated embodiment is<br>
circular. The first leg has a propogation length that is relatively short compared to the<br>
propogation length of the second leg. The second leg has a cross sectional area in the<br>
shape of a slot. The cross sectional width of the slot is sufficiently narrow so as to<br>
accommodate sound wavelengths that are greater than the slot width. The cross<br>
sectional length of the slot is sufficiently long, at least at the opening, so as to not be<br>
blocked by the contact surface of a user's finger. While a specific size and shape of<br>
the manifold 112, 114 has been illustrated and discussed, one skilled in the art will<br>
readily recognize, that the sound waves can be appropriately redirected with<br>
manifolds 112, 114 having other shapes and sizes, including legs that meet at an<br>
angle, which are not substantially perpendicular.<br>
By orienting the transducers 112, 114, and manifolds 116, 118, as shown, a<br>
minimal amount of interior space of the device can accommodate the sound system<br>
assembly, while routing each of the sound waves produced by the transducers 112,<br>
114, so as to exit the device 100 proximate the device's corresponding side facing<br>
110. In the illustrated embodiment, the transducers 112, 114 are side-by-side or<br>
laterally offset from one another in a horizontal direction along the front facing of the<br>
device 100. However, it is possible that the transducers 112, 114, could be stacked,<br>
and/or alternatively spaced and/or angled and still enjoy the benefits of the teachings<br>
of the present invention.<br>
By porting a left audio signal out of the left side of the phone, and porting a<br>
right audio signal out of the right side of the phone, a stereo audio image can be<br>
produced. Furthermore, the apparent separation of the signal sources is extended to<br>
the full width of the hand held device 100. Still further, the direction of the porting<br>
arrangement is conducive to creating reflections from nearby objects, which can<br>
further enhance the perception of increased separation of the sources of the left and<br>
right side signals. By adjusting the depth of the transducers 112, 114, the specific<br>
shape of the manifold 116, 118, and correspondingly the location of the ports 106, the<br>
exact location, relative to the side facing of the device 100 that the sound waves exit<br>
the device 100, can be adjusted.<br>
The beneficial effects of the increased spacing is especially prevalent, when<br>
the device is in front of the user, for example, if the user is viewing the display (i.e.<br>
accessing a menu, playing a game, etc.). In an alternative embodiment, where the<br>
user may reorient the device, by rotating the device 90 degrees during usage, it may<br>
be beneficial to place audio output ports on the top and bottom side surfaces of the<br>
hand held device. A pair of audio output ports on the top and bottom side surfaces of<br>
the hand held device can be in addition to the pair of output ports located on the<br>
opposing side facings of the device 100. In such an instance a tilt sensor could detect<br>
the orientation of the device, and appropriately enable the corresponding pair of audio<br>
output ports, which have a horizontal spacing.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a front plan view, of the device illustrated in FIGS. 1-3.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 4 illustrates the apparent distance Wl between audio stereo<br>
sources, associated with the location of ports, where the sound waves have not been<br>
redirected, as opposed to the apparent distance W2 between audio stereo sources,<br>
where the sound waves have been redirected, in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The front plan view additionally illustrates the expansion of the length LI<br>
of the slot-shaped cross sectional area of the redirected leg portion of the manifold to<br>
an expanded length L2 proximate the opening 106 in the side wall of the device 100.<br>
As noted previously, the expanded length L2 is longer than the contact surface of a<br>
user's finger.<br>
In addition to having an expanded length L2, the slot opening is additionally<br>
located proximate the top of the device 100 near the display, where it may be less<br>
likely that a user's hand will be gripping the phone. Consequently, any attempt to<br>
avoid obstructing and/or covering the display by the users in many instances may also<br>
discourage the covering of the audio ports 106. FIG. 5 illustrates, at least one<br>
example of a perspective view of a device being held by a user's hand 200, which<br>
highlights the contact surface of the user's finger 202, which is in contact with the<br>
device 100 relative to the slot-shaped opening 106. While the present use of a slot<br>
shaped audio port opening having an extended length has been shown in connection<br>
with a pair of output ports for producing a stereo audio image, an extended length slot<br>
can beneficially be used in other instances, where a stereo audio image is not being<br>
produced, and/or where fewer or more audio ports are being used.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of a wireless communication device 300,<br>
like a cellular telephone, within which the present invention can be incorporated.<br>
Generally, the wireless communication device communicates information via radio<br>
frequency signals. In the wireless communication device 300, the particular radio<br>
frequency is determined by the microprocessor 302. The particular radio frequency is<br>
conveyed to the frequency synthesizer 304 via the interface circuitry 306. Data<br>
signals received by the receiver 308 are decoded and coupled to the microprocessor<br>
302 by the interface circuitry 306, and data signals to be transmitted by the transmitter<br>
310 are generated by the microprocessor 302 and formatted by the interface circuitry<br>
306 before being transmitted by the transmitter 310. Operational status of the<br>
transmitter 310 and the receiver 308 is enabled or disabled by the interface circuitry<br>
306.<br>
In at least one embodiment, the microprocessor 302, an audio processor 324,<br>
and a user interface processor 328 perform many of the processing functions under<br>
the control of program instructions stored in a memory section 322. Together, the<br>
microprocessor 302, the audio processor 324, and the user interface processor 328 can<br>
include one or more microprocessors, one or more of which may include a digital<br>
signal processor (DSP). The memory section 322 includes one or more forms of<br>
volatile and/or non-volatile memory including conventional ROM 312, EPROM 314,<br>
RAM 316, or EEPROM 318. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that other<br>
types of memory are possible.<br>
Identifying features of the wireless communication device are typically stored<br>
in EEPROM 318 (which may also be stored in the microprocessor in an on-board<br>
EEPROM, if available) and can include the number assignment (NAM) required for<br>
operation in a conventional cellular system and/or the base identification (BID)<br>
required for operation with a cordless base. Additionally stored in the memory<br>
section 322 are prestored instructions for reproducing a stereo audio image. In many<br>
cases prestored and/or downloaded audio files for later playback may be additionally<br>
stored, such as ringer tones, sounds generated by the programming of the user<br>
interface, multi-media and/or other types of files with audio related data. These files<br>
can be stored in either open standard, proprietary, and/or other types of formats.<br>
Control of user audio, the microphone 320 and the pair of speakers,<br>
corresponding to the pair of transducers 112, 114, illustrated in FIGS. 2-4, is<br>
controlled by the audio processor or audio processing circuitry 324, which forms part<br>
of a user interface circuit 326. The user interface circuit 326 additionally includes the<br>
user interface processor or user interface processing circuitry 328, which manages the<br>
operation of any keypad(s) 102 and/or display(s) 104. It is further envisioned that any<br>
keypad operation could be included as part of a touch sensitive display.<br>
While the present invention has generally been described in association with a<br>
wireless communication device, like a cell phone, radiotelephone, or a cordless<br>
telephone, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that the invention is suitable for<br>
use with other types of devices. At least a couple of additional examples of other<br>
types of devices, where the use of the present invention would be suitable include<br>
paging devices, personal digital assistants, portable computers, pen-based or<br>
keyboard-based handheld devices, remote control units, an audio player (such as an<br>
MP3 player) and the like.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a flow diagram of a method 400 for reproducing a stereo<br>
audio image in a hand held device, which has a pair of transducers ported out of the<br>
device via a pair of corresponding manifolds. The manifolds have a first opening<br>
aligned with the respective one of the pair of transducers and a second opening<br>
aligned with an exterior surface of the hand held device. The method 400 includes<br>
producing 405 a sound wave at a first transducer having a front facing directed toward<br>
one of a front and back facing of the hand held device toward which the sound wave<br>
produced by the first transducer initially propagates. The direction of travel of the<br>
sound wave produced by the first transducer is then redirected 410 away from the one<br>
of the front and back facing of the hand held device toward an exterior side surface of<br>
the hand held device via a first manifold.<br>
A sound wave is produced 415 at a second transducer having a front facing<br>
directed toward one of a front and back facing of the hand held device toward which<br>
the sound wave produced by the second transducer initially propagates. The direction<br>
of travel of the sound wave produced by the second transducer is then redirected 420<br>
away from the one of the front and back facing of the hand held device toward an<br>
exterior side surface of the hand held device via a second manifold, which is opposite<br>
to the exterior side surface through which the sound wave produced by the first<br>
transducer is redirected.<br>
In at least one embodiment the sound wave produced by the first transducer is<br>
produced concurrently with the sound wave produced by the second transducer.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br>
