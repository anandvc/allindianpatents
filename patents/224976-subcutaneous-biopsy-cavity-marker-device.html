				<td>SUBCUTANEOUS BIOPSY CAVITY MARKER DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional App. Serial No. 60/476,533<br>
filed June 6, 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. This<br>
invention relates to nonabsorbablebiopsy cavity maker devices and methods for<br>
identifying such devices in a subcutaneous biopsy cavity, including a breast biopsy<br>
cavity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Invasive breast cancer, the most common nonskin cancer in American women,<br>
was disgnosed in approximately 184,000 women in the United States in 2000, and let to<br>
approximately 41,000 deaths (Nancy E. Davidson. 2001. "Breast Cancer", Section 12 Part<br>
VII In Scientific American Medicine. Edward Rubenstein and Daniel D. Fedennan eds.,<br>
Scientific American, Inc.: New York, NY). Current guidelines for breast cancer<br>
screening recommended by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer<br>
Institute include monthly breast self examination for all women older than 20 years and<br>
annual mammography for women older than 40 years who are at standard risk for breast<br>
cancer. For those at higher risk, current practice advocates that mammographic screening<br>
begin at 25 years of age or five years earlier than the age of the person with the earliest<br>
diagnosis of breast cancer in the immediate or extended family.<br>
Breast cancer may present as architectural changes or microcalcifications on a<br>
mammogram, or by clinical symptoms, such as a palpable mass, nipple discharge, or skin<br>
or nipple changes. Regardless of whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic, a<br>
histologic examination of the suspect tissue is mandatory to establish a diagnosis. Open<br>
incisional or excisional biopsies were commonly performed in the past to obtain tissue<br>
samples. The modern trend relies on fine-needle aspiration, core-needle biopsy, or other<br>
image guided or non-image guided percutaneous procedures, e.g., vacuum assisted biopsy<br>
using the MAMMOTOME® breast biopsy system (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.,<br>
Cincinnati, OH), to obtain a sample of cells or tissue for diagnosis.<br>
After any given biopsy procedure, a subsequent examination of the biopsy site is<br>
often desirable. For example, if the initial biopsy only partially removed the suspect<br>
tissue, and a malignant lesion is subsequently diagnosed, re-excision of the original<br>
biopsy site is indicated. Identification of a biopsy site is also helpful during patient<br>
follow-up examinations for reoccurrence. Thus, mere is a need to determine the location,<br>
most importantly the center, as well as the orientation and margins of the subcutaneous<br>
tissue cavity from which the suspect lesion is removed.<br>
Prior methods of marking biopsy cavities utilize one or more tissue marking clips<br>
as the biopsy site marking device. One representative marking apparatus is the<br>
MICROMARK™II tissue marker (Biopsis Medical, Inc., Irvine, CA). Among other<br>
concerns, deployment of the MICROMARK™]] tissue maker is unreliable, the marker<br>
device often failing to properly attach to the cavity wall. Furthermore, because clip<br>
attachment occurs to the side, not the center of the cavity, spatial orientation and position<br>
of the cavity is difficult if not impossible during follow-up examination. Moreover,<br>
during the stereotactic breast biopsy procedure, the breast is under compression when the<br>
marking clip is placed. Upon release of the compressive force, the clip will migrate<br>
relative to the biopsy void, and the orientation as well as the location of the margins of the<br>
cavity are usually lost.<br>
Other biopsy markers that attempt to minimize migration, e.g., after tissue is<br>
decompressed, are described in U.S. 6,161,034 and U.S. 6,347,241, both to Burbank et<br>
al.; U.S. 6,270,464 to Fulton, III et al.; and U.S. 6,350,244 and WO 01/62135, both to<br>
Fisher.<br>
Burbank et al. describes chemical preparations of collagen or gelatin having a<br>
visible marker such as carbon particles or a dye that are introduced into biopsy cavities.<br>
The markers are imageable by mammography, fluoroscopy, CT, or MRI.<br>
Fulton, m et al. depicts a swellable marker that may be palpably harder after<br>
delivery into the biopsy cavity. The marker is imageable by mammography, ultrasound,<br>
or MRI.<br>
In U.S. 6,350,244 and WO 01/62135, Fisher describes markers that are hollow<br>
spheres made from polylactic acid. The spheres are filled with iodine or other radiopaque<br>
material to make mem imageable by available radiograpbic techniques such as x-ray<br>
and/or ultrasound. Multiple markers are introduced to fill the biopsy cavity.<br>
In U.S. 6,347,241, Burbank et al. describes a marker body mat includes a pre-<br>
shaped pellet formed of bioabsorbable material having a plurality of gas bubbles<br>
dispersed therein which are configured to facilitate ultrasonic observation of the pellet at<br>
a biopsy site within a patient and having an X-ray detectable element of specific<br>
predetermined non-biological configuration embedded therein.<br>
Although the above mentioned marker devices address some of the problems<br>
associated with clip-type markers, the problem of prolonged monitoring of a biopsy site<br>
still remains. Thus, it would be of considerable medical benefit to be able to permanently<br>
mark the location of a biopsy cavity, especially after a percutaneous biopsy procedure.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is a subcutaneous biopsy cavity marking device that<br>
permanently remains within the biopsy cavity after deployment, and which has<br>
one or more marker elements mat allows identification of the biopsy cavity center,<br>
orientation, or margin, using various imaging modalities.<br>
The marking device generally includes a first marker element and a second<br>
nonabsorbable marker element. The first marker element is detectable by a first imaging<br>
modality. The second marker element is detectable by a second imaging modality that<br>
differs from the first imaging modality. In one embodiment, the first imaging modality<br>
usually does not visualize the second marker element. However, if it is visualized, the<br>
second marker element will have a configuration such that it is distinguishable from<br>
naturally occurring artifacts, and is configured so that it does not obscure the presence of<br>
any tissue pathology or confound the reading of any imaging study using the first<br>
modality. In a preferred variation, x-ray is the first imaging modality and<br>
ultrasonography is the second imaging modality.<br>
The first marker element may be variously shaped, and made from materials such<br>
as gold, iridium, nickel, rhodium, silver, stainless steel, tantalum, titanium, and alloys<br>
thereof. A radiopaque additive may also be coated on or incorporated into the first<br>
marker element to enhance the radiopacity of the element.<br>
The second marker element may also have various configurations asd is formed<br>
from nonabsorbable materials such as fluoropolymers, polyester or polyester mixtures,<br>
polypropylene, and nylon or nylon mixtures. An echogenic coating may also be provided<br>
on the second marker element to enhance its detection by ultrasound imaging.<br>
In addition to being nonabsorbable, in one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
marking devices are nonpalpable. In a further embodiment, pharmaceutical agents such<br>
as hemostatic, analgesic, or anesthetic substances may also be incorporated into either the<br>
first or second marker elements or both. In some cases, it may also be desirable to form<br>
the marker device to emit therapeutic radiation to treat any diseased tissue remaining<br>
within the biopsy cavity.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The biopsy marker devices of this invention may take various forms, but are<br>
generally configured to have a size and shape appropriate for identifying a biopsy cavity,<br>
e.g., a breast biopsy cavity. Once within the biopsy cavity, the marker device allows<br>
localization, as well as orientation and identification of the cavity margins. The marker<br>
devices are nonabsorbable, allowing long-term follow-up examination of the biopsy site if<br>
desired. When the marker devices permanently remain within the biopsy cavities, they<br>
are preferably formed to be nonpalpable.<br>
The reluctance to use nonabsorbable biopsy cavity markers may arise from the<br>
notion that a foreign body reaction may be generated by the prolonged presence of the<br>
marker in the cavity, leading to flbrosis. The area of induration would most likely be<br>
palpable and thus, undesirable to the patient. Therefore, the marker devices of this<br>
invention will be constructed from biocompatible materials which do not produce any<br>
detrimental effect (such as fibrosis or other palpable or noticeable condition) on the<br>
patient.<br>
Furthermore, a need for nonabsorbable markers was not present in the past<br>
because most patients with nonpalpable suspicious lesions underwent wire localization .<br>
biopsy which is an open incisional or excisional biopsy. If a malignancy was diagnosed<br>
from the specimen, re-excision was accomplished by opening the previous incision.<br>
However, with the increasing popularity of percutaneous biopsy procedures and breast-<br>
sparing surgery, biopsy cavities are decreasing in size, making them difficult to detect on<br>
follow-up imaging. Long-term follow-up for suspicious lesions that are found to be<br>
benign after percutaneous biopsy is difficult if biopsy cavity markers are generally<br>
bioabsorbable, and degrade after a few months. The biopsy cavity markers of this<br>
invention are nonabsorbable, and thus are detectable for follow-up over any desired<br>
period of time.<br>
The marker devices may be introduced into biopsy cavities by various suitable<br>
percutaneous access devices, e.g., as described in U.S. 6,356,782 and U.S. 6,371,904 to<br>
Sirimanne et al., and U.S. Publication No. 2003/0050571 to Zarins et al which are herein<br>
incorporate by reference in their entireties.<br>
Figures 1A-1G show various configurations of subcutaneous cavity marking<br>
devices of the present invention. In the Figures, the marker device 100 is displayed as<br>
having either a generally spherical body (Fig. 1A), a multi-faced body 106 (Fig. IB), or a<br>
generally cylindrical body 112 (Fig. 1C). In addition, it is within the scope of this<br>
invention for the body to assume a variety of other shapes. For example, the marker<br>
device may be configured to have conical or ellipsoidal shapes, substantially planar<br>
surfaces, such as polyhedric (i.e., cubic, tetrahedral) or prismatic forms, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, the nonabsorbable materials that make up the marker devices may be<br>
designed to have a knotted structure (Fig. ID) or a looped (Fig E), layered (Fig. IF), or<br>
rolled (Fig. 1G) arrangement.<br>
The particular marker device may be of any shape, as well as size, so long as the<br>
marker is distinguishable from tissue pathology, e.g., microcalcifications, or from<br>
anatomically occurring artifacts, and will typically be chosen to best match die biopsy<br>
cavity dimensions. Marker devices having a fixed geometry, e.g., rolls or cubes, are<br>
preferable because their geometry is more readily distinguishable from tissue pathology<br>
and anatomically occurring artifacts.<br>
The subcutaneous biopsy cavity markers generally include a first marker element<br>
(e.g., 102, 108, 114, 118, 122,126, 130) and a second marker element (e.g., 104,110,<br>
116,120, 124, 128,132). The first marker element is detectable by a first imaging<br>
modality. The second marker element is detectable by a second imaging modality but<br>
preferably is not detectable by the first imaging modality. By "not detectable" we mean<br>
that under the first imaging modality there is no significant visualization of the second<br>
marker element. The second imaging modality will typically provide a more efficient<br>
outpatient follow-up process because the imaging device is portable, and readily available<br>
in most surgical oncology offices. Preferably, the first imaging modality is x-ray and the<br>
second imaging modality is ultrasonography.<br>
The first imaging modality is usually a radiographic imaging modality. For<br>
example, an x-ray such as a mammogram may be taken, or an image may be obtained<br>
using computed tomography (CT) for fluoroscopy. Besides radiography, magnetic<br>
resonance imaging (MRI) may also be performed. In a preferred variation,<br>
mammography is used as the first imaging modality. By using ultrasonography as the<br>
second imaging modality, which will also be employed for long-term follow-up, total<br>
radiation exposure to the patient is decreased. In addition, the increasing use of hand-held<br>
or portable ultrasound devices by surgeons provides convenient long-term outpatient<br>
follow-up without referral back to a radiologist.<br>
The first marker element 102,108,114,118, 122, 126, 130 may be confined<br>
within the structure of the second marker element 104, 110, 116, 120, 124, 128,132, as<br>
seen in Figs. 1A-1C, or may wrap around a portion of the second marker element, as seen<br>
in Figs. 1D-1G. The placement of the marker elements in relation to one another may<br>
vary according to such factors as type of tissue biopsied, dimensions of the biopsy cavity,<br>
number of first marker elements employed, and physician preference, so long as the<br>
center of the cavity, and the orientation and margins of the cavity can generally be<br>
identified.<br>
The first marker element 102,108,114,118,122, 126,130 may be spherical<br>
(Figs. 1A and IB), ring-shaped (Figs. 1C-1G, 2A), or barbed in a V configuration (Fig.<br>
2B). Although the Figures illustrate only three configurations for the first marker<br>
elements, the invention contemplates other configurations that allow adequate detection<br>
of the biopsy cavity as described above. Furthermore, a plurality of first marker elements<br>
may be included in the marking device if so indicated or desired. In one variation, as<br>
seen in Figure 2C, a plurality of rings 200 are connected by a joining member 204, e.g.,<br>
by an adhesive or soldering, to form a first marker element 206.<br>
In one embodiment, the first marker element 102,108, 114, 118, 122, 126,130<br>
may be made from nonabsorbable, metallic materials including, but not limited to, gold;<br>
iridium; nickel; rhodium; silver; stainless steel; tantalum; titanium; and alloys thereof. In<br>
a preferred variation, the first marker element is made from titanium. However, the first<br>
marker element may be made from any type of materials, so long as it is biocompatible<br>
and nonabsorbable.<br>
If desired, the radiopaciry of the first marker element may be enhanced by adding<br>
a radiopaque additive coating to the marker. Suitable radiopaque additives include<br>
elements such as barium-containing compounds, bismuth- containing compounds,<br>
powdered tantalum, powdered tungsten, barium carbonate, bismuth oxide, and barium<br>
sulfate.<br>
The second marker element may also be provided in various configurations. For<br>
example, in one variation, the second marker element 120 is formed from knotted surgical<br>
suture. As seen in Fig. ID, the first marker element 118 is a ring that wraps around the<br>
second marker element 120 in the form of a knotted mass.. In another variation, the<br>
second marker element is a looped arrangement of suture 124 (Fig. IE). The suture<br>
material is looped through the first marker element 122, also a ring structure, to form a<br>
pair of opposing loops 125. In yet a further variation, the second marker element is a<br>
layered arrangement of nonabsorbable, echogenic, sheet or mesh-like material 128<br>
centrally fastened together with a ring-shaped first marker element 126 (Fig. IF). In<br>
another variation, as seen in Fig 1G, the second marker element is in a rolled<br>
configuration 132. The roll 132 is passed through and secured by a first marker element,<br>
ring 130. In some instances, a plurality of second marker elements may be deployed to<br>
fill the biopsy cavity.<br>
The second marker element may be made from biocompatdble, nonabsorbable<br>
materials including, but not limited to, polymers such as fluoropolymers; polyester (e.g.,<br>
Reemay® spunbond polyester, Dacron® polyester fibers) and polyester mixtures (e.g.,<br>
mixtures of polyester and rayon); polypropylene; and nylon and nylon mixtures. If<br>
desired, the second marker element may be made from a resilient material. The<br>
composition of the second marker element may vary so long as the material it is made<br>
from is biocompatible, nonabsorbable, detectable by ultrasound (echogenic), and<br>
nonpalpable when placed into a biopsy cavity. These nonabsorbable materials may be<br>
subjected to processes such as lyophilization or sintering to bulk them and/or have them<br>
capture air. Die-cut second marker elements may be produced using materials treated in<br>
this matter. For example, instead of layering or rolling the nonabsorbable material as<br>
shown in Figs. IF an 1G, respectively, a structure that resembles the shape and size of the<br>
layered or rolled marker elements may be cut out from nonabsorbable material that has<br>
been lyophilized.<br>
To enhance detection by ultrasound, the second marker element may be coated<br>
with an echogenic substance. One such substance is the ECHO-COAT® coating (STS<br>
Biopolymers, Henrietta, NY). Echogenic coatings provide the coated marker element<br>
with an acoustically reflective interface and a large acoustical impedence differential.<br>
Pharmaceutical agents such as hemostatic, analgesic, or anesthetic agents may<br>
also be incorporated into the first and/or second marker elements of the device.<br>
Hemostasis-promoting agents help to prevent the formation of hematomas and may also<br>
help to promote the healing process. The first and/or second marker elements of the<br>
biopsy cavity marker device may also be formed to emit therapeutic radiation to treat any<br>
cancerous tissue remaining in the margin of the biopsy cavity.<br>
The biopsy cavity marker devices of the present invention may be inserted into a<br>
biopsy cavity by any known means. For example, a marker (or several markers) may be<br>
inserted into a syringe type applicator and injected into a biopsy cavity.<br>
