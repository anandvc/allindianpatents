Protein kinase C (PKC) consists of a family of closely related enzymes that function as serine/threonine kinases.  Protein kinase C plays an important role in cell-cell signaling, gene expression, and in the control of cell differentiation and growth.  At present, there are currently at least ten known isozymes of PKC that differ in their tissue distribution, enzymatic specificity, and regulation. Nishizuka Y.  Annu. Rev. Biochem. 58: 31-44 (1989); Nishizuka Y. Science 258: 607-614 (1992).<br>
Protein kinase C isozymes are single polypeptide chains ranging from 592 to 737 amino acids in length. The isozymes contain a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain connected by a linker peptide.  The regulatory and catalytic domains can be further subdivided into constant and variable regions.  The catalytic domain of protein kinase C is very similar to that seen in other protein kinases while the regulatory domain is unique to the PKC isozymes.  The PKC isozymes demonstrate between 40-80% homology at the amino acid level among the group.  However, the homology of a single isozyme between different species is generally greater than 97%.<br>
Protein kinase C is a membrane-associated enzyme that is allosterically regulated by a number of factors, including membrane phospholipids, calcium, and certain membrane lipids such as diacylglycerols that are liberated in response to the activities of phospholipases.  Bell, R.M. and Burns, D.J., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 4661-4664 (1991); Nishizuka, Y. Science 258: 607-614 (1992).  The protein kinase C isozymes, alpha, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma, require membrane phospholipid, calcium and diacylglycerol/phorbol esters for full activation.  The delta, epsilon, eta, and theta forms of PKC are calcium-independent in their mode of activation.  The zeta and lambda forms of PKC are independent of both calcium and diacylglycerol and are believed to require only membrane phospholipid for their activation.<br>
2--<br><br>
Only one or two of the protein kinase C isozymes may be involved in a given disease state.  For example, the elevated blood glucose levels found in diabetes lead to an isozyme-specific elevation of the beta-2 isozyme in vascular tissues.  Inoguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:<br>
11059-11065 (1992). A diabetes-linked elevation of the beta isozyme in human platelets has been correlated with their altered response to agonists.  Bastyr in, E.J. and Lu, J. Diabetes 42: (Suppl. 1) 97A (1993).  The human vitamin D<br>
receptor has been shown to be selectively phosphorylated by-protein kinase C beta.  This phosphorylation has been linked to alterations in the functioning of the receptor.  Hsieh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 9315-9319 (1991); Hsieh et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 15118-15126 (1993). In addition, recent work has shown that the beta-2 isozyme is responsible for erythroleukemia cell proliferation while the alpha isozyme is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation in these same cells.  Murray et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 15847-15853<br>
(1993).<br>
The ubiquitous nature of the protein kinase C isozymes and their important roles in physiology provide incentives to produce highly selective PKC inhibitors.  Given the evidence demonstrating linkage of certain isozymes to disease states, it is reasonable to assume that inhibitory compounds that are selective to one or two protein kinase C isozymes relative to the other PKC isozymes and other protein kinases are superior therapeutic agents.  Such compounds demonstrate greater efficacy and lower toxicity by virtue of their specificity.<br>
A class of N,N'-bridged bisindolylmaleimides has been disclosed in Heath et al., EP 0 657 458 (U.S.S.N. 08/413,735), published on June 14, 1995, as EP 0 657 458.  A preferred compound in this N,N'-bridged series includes a compound of the Formula I:<br>

The reaction to form Compound IV is accomplished by any of the known methods of preparing N-substituted indoles.<br>
-8-<br><br>
The reaction usually involves approximately equimolar amounts of reagents II and Ill, although other ratios, especially those wherein the alkylating reagent is in excess, are operative.

The optimal ratio is dependent on the solvent selected and is preferably<br>
-9-<br><br>
acetone at a 9:1 solvent to water ratio.  The reaction usually involves approximately equimolar amounts of the two reagents, although other ratios, especially those wherein the methanesulfonic acid is in excess, are operative.  The rate of addition of methanesulfonic acid is not critical to the reaction and may be added rapidly (
The mesylate salt is isolated by filtration or other separation techniques appreciated in the art directly from the reaction mixture in yields ranging from 50 % to 100 %.  Recrystallization and other purification techniques known in the art may be used to further purify the salt if desired.<br>

This reaction can be monitored by HPLC.  The acetone was removed from the reaction mixture in vacuo  and the resultant solid was extracted into a 300 mL of ethyl acetate/ 200 mL water mixture.  The organic layer was washed with 200 mL more water and the combined aqueous layer was back-extracted with 100 mL of additional ethyl acetate.  The combined organic layer was washed with 200 mL of a 10% aqueous solution of sodium sulfite (this wash removed the yellow color), 100 mL of brine, was dried (MgS04), and was evaporated in vacuo  to give 5.45 g (98%) of 3-[2-iodoethoxy]-4-{tripenylmethoxy-iodobutone as a clear oil.

After 16 hours the reaction mixture was washed with 0.IN HCl, brine, and the organic layer was concentrated.  The residue was  passed through a plug of silica eluting with a slow gradient of 0-10% MeCN in CH2CI2.  The eluant fraction containing the desired mesylate was concentrated to yield 2.8 g of the titled compound as a magenta solid.  Overall yield from the diiodide is 18%.  MS.<br>

Most unexpectedly, the claimed salt form has improved solubility and, most significantly, dramatically improved bioavailability to the patient.  The salt is readily prepared in single crystalline form and results in a greater reduction of impurities.  The following examples provide a comparative analysis demonstrating the unexpected and superior properties of the claimed salt.<br>

Example 9 Comparison of Yield. Total Related Substances and Residual<br>
Solvents Total related substances refers to the relative amounts of impurities in the final product and is thus a measure of the purity.  For the salts prepared the highest yield, 82%, was observed during preparation of the sulfate (Table I), with the lowest yield, 52%, being obtained for the succinate.  Although the total related substances (TRS) were reduced in the preparation of each of the salts, the largest reduction of 5.2 6 % was observed during preparation of the mesylate salt.  The hydrochloride salt was the only salt that contained residual methanol (0.62 wt. %) after drying at 50°C in a vacuum oven for approximately 16 hours.  The succinate, acetate and phosphate contained 0.18 to 1.32 % THF by GC assay which is presumably left in the salts from the penultimate step in the synthesis which was carried out in an aqueous THF.<br>

fully titrated under conditions for preparation as determined by X-ray powder diffraction.  dPhosphate was partially titrated as determined by X-ray powder diffraction.<br>
Example 10 Comparison bv X-Rav Diffraction The salts were also compared by polarizing microscopy to determine crystallinity (birefringence). Powder X-Ray diffraction indicated that only the hydrochloride, mesylate, succinate and acetate salts were crystalline and resulted in unique X-ray patterns.  The succinate and acetate X-ray powder patterns were very similar to each other and were shown to correlate with the free base pattern.  The sulfate, tartrate, and phosphate salts were poorly crystalline having significant amorphous characters. Crystalline salts are preferred due to ease of purification and subsequently handling.<br>
Example 11 Comparison of Solubility<br>
The aqueous solubility of each salt was determined by UV analysis (Table II) and compared.  Most unexpectedly, the mesylate salt has the greatest aqueous solubility, 1.76 mg/mL.  The solubility of the mesylate is significantly higher than the other salts.  The data in Table II demonstrate' that the claimed salt is six times more soluble in water than the most common pharmaceutically acceptable salt, the hydrochloride salt (0.268 mg/mL).  Subsequent studies consistently demonstrate a two to six fold increase in solubility.  The high pH observed with the succinate and acetate salt indicated the presence of untitrated free base.<br>

The aqueous solubility of the mesylate salt is very pH dependent in that optimal solubility is observed at pH 4.0 to 5.0, preferably pH 4.5 (2.25 mg/mL).  The solubility drops markedly at either higher or lower pH.  In addition to the pH dependence of the solubility, the aqueous solubility of the mesylate salt drops markedly with the addition of chloride in the form of sodium chloride due to the formation of the HCl salt.<br>
Example 12 Comparison of Thermoaravometric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetrv (DSC), and Mettler Hot Stage Microscopy Each salt was analyzed by TGA, DSC and Mettler hot stage microscopy and compared (Table III).  The salts displayed a weight loss of 0.73 to 5.50% when heated from 20° to 100° C.  The sulfate, tartrate and phosphate salts showed the greatest weight loss at 5.50% each.  When the salts were heated from 100° to 200° C, the hydrochloride, succinate and acetate salts were the only salts that exhibited further weight loss.  DSC analysis indicated that the mesylate salt produced a sharp endotherm melt peak at 261.6°C.  The sulfate salt displayed a somewhat broad endotherm at 267.4°C.  The hydrochloride, succinate, tartrate, acetate and phosphate salts did not exhibit a melting endotherm by DSC.  The<br>

succinate, acetate, and phosphate displayed DSC exotherms at approximately 245° C.  The samples were also examined by hot stage microscopy using a Mettler hot stage.

The salts gained from 1.2 to 8.4% weight when comparing the weights from exposure to vacuum to exposure to 80% RH.  The phosphate salt was the most hygroscopic followed by the tartrate salt, mesylate, sulfate, acetate, hydrochloride and succinate.  The Karl-Fisher data matched the hygroscopicity data fairly well in that the tartrate, sulfate, phosphate and mesylate salts contained the most water.<br>
Example 14 Solvents for Salt Preparation The mesylate salt was prepared in methanol/water, 100% acetone, 9:1 acetone/water, 3:1 acetone/water and 1:1 acetone/water.

aThe base utilized to prepare these salts had 9.98% total related substances.  bThe base utilized to prepare these salts had 7.03% total related substances.  cAssay limit of detection was 0.1% (1000 ppm) .<br>
The mesylate salt prepared from 5:1 acetone/water had 0.7 % total related substances, a reduction of 9.3 % from the TRS of the free base, however the yield was low at 39 %.  The yield increased to 73 %, with 2.0 % TRS if 9:1 acetone water was utilized.  The TRS of the hydrochloride salt was also reduced to 4.7 %, a 5.3 % reduction, however 2.4 % of an unknown related substance was present.  The ability to produce the claimed salts with significantly reduced impurities (TRS) results in a more efficient preparation and avoids costly downstream purification.<br>
Because the hydrochloride salt is the most common pharmaceutical salt and is specifically disclosed in Heath et al., 08/413735, published on June 14, 1995 as EP 0 657 458 (Example 5), a biological comparison of the mesylate and HCl salt was carried out.  Most unexpectedly, the claimed mesylate salt is significantly more bioavailable than the HCl salt.  The bioavailability of the salt forms was measured in four Male Beagle Dogs by orally administering a single 20 mg/kg dose of the HCl and the claimed mesylate salt in a 10%<br>
-28-<br><br>
acacia suspension.  One week washout period was allowed between doses.  Doses were administered in a cross-over design (2 dogs/salt/study dog).  The plasma concentration of the active compound as well as an active metabolite was monitored.  Higher plasma concentrations of (S)-13-[dimethylamino)methyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-lH,13H-dibenzo[E,K]pyrrolo[3,4-H][1,4,13]oxadiazacyclohexadecine-l,3(2H)-dione and the metabolite were achieved in each dog following an oral dose of the claimed mesylate salt than an equivalent dose of the HCl salt.  The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax±error)<br>
following the administration of the HCl salt was 400±142 ng/mL (compound) and 862±255 ng/mL (metabolite).  The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax±error) following the administration of the claimed mesylate salt was 8961243 ng/mL (compound) and 24551930 ng/mL (metabolite).  This represents an approximately 260 % increase in plasma concentration of the compound and the metabolite.<br>
The plasma concentration of the compound as well as the metabolite was also plotted as a function of time during the study.  The ratio of the area under the concentration curve (AUC) represents a measure of bioavailability of the compound to the patient.  The AUC ratio for the HCl salt and the claimed mesylate was calculated and is depicted in Table VI.<br>

Most unexpectedly, the data i<br>
In Table VI demonstrate that the mesylate salt is 2.58 times more bioavailable than the HC1 salt.  This significant increase in bioavailability allows a lower dose to be administered to a patient to get the same pharmaceutical effect.  Thus, the exposure to the patient is minimized.  Additionally, the lower unit dosage form lowers the cost of the compound and reduces the amount of compound required for manufacture.  Therefore, the dose of the mesylate salt of the present invention is predicted to be 0.5 mg/kg/dose to .25 mg/kg/dose, more preferably 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose.  This dose is substantially lower than the dose of the HC1 salt which yields the same blood level.<br>
A summary of the physical data for the seven salts indicates that the mesylate salt has significantly improved physical properties of the salts studied and disclosed in Heath et al., EP 0 657 458.  Most significantly, a comparison of the bioavailability of the claimed salt and the HC1 salt demonstrates the claimed mesylate salts are dramatically improved therapeutic agents.  Thus, the advantages of the claimed mesylate salts include:<br>
(1)	high aqueous solubility;<br>
(2)	large reduction in HPLC total related substances;<br>
(3)	no residual solvents by GC assay;<br>
(4)	crystalline by X-Ray powder diffraction and polarizing microscopy;<br>
(5)	a sharp melting point by DSC; and<br>
(6)	greater than 2.5 times the bioavailability of the HCl salt.<br>
As previously stated, the compound of the present invention are active as selective Protein Kinase C inhibitors.  The activity of compound is disclosed in Heath et al., EP 0 657 458, published on June 14, 1995.  The activity was determined in the Calcium Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Assay, Casein Protein Kinase II assay, cAMP-<br>

methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1 to about 20 mg, more usually about 2 to about 10 mg, of the active ingredient. However, it will be understood that the therapeutic dosage administered will be determined by the physician in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.  The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
