				<td>THYROID HORMONE ANALOGS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives,<br>
and polymeric forms thereof. Methods of using such compounds, and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing same are also disclosed. The invention also relates to methods of<br>
preparing such compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and L-triiodothyronine (T3), regulate many<br>
different physiological processes in different tissues in vertebrates. Most of the actions of<br>
thyroid hormones are mediated by the thyroid hormone receptor ("TR"), which is a member<br>
of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription regulators. This<br>
superfamily also includes receptors for steroid hormones, retinoids, and 1,25-<br>
dihydroxyvitamin D3. These receptors are transcription factors that can regulate expression<br>
of specific genes in various tissues and are targets for widely used drugs, such as tamoxifen,<br>
an estrogen receptor partial antagonist. There are two different genes that encode two<br>
different TRs, TRa and TRfl These two TRs are often co-expressed at different levels in<br>
different tissues. Most thyroid hormones do not discriminate between the two TRs and bind<br>
both with similar affinities.<br>
Gene knockout studies in mice indicate that TRp plays a role in the development of<br>
the auditory system and in the negative feedback of thyroid stimulating hormone by T3 in<br>
the pituitary, whereas TRa modulates the effect of thyroid hormone on calorigenesis and on<br>
the cardiovascular system. The identification of TR antagonists could play an important<br>
role in the future treatment of hypothyroidism. Such molecules would act rapidly by<br>
directly antagonizing the effect of thyroid hormone at the receptor level, a significant<br>
improvement for individuals with hypothyroidism who require surgery, have cardiac<br>
disease, or are at risk for life-threatening thyrotoxic storm.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for the development of compounds that selectively<br>
modulate thyroid hormone action by functioning as isoform-selective agonists or<br>
antagonists of the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) would prove useful for medical therapy.<br>
Recent efforts have focused on the design and synthesis of thyroid hormone (T3/T4)<br>
antagonists as potential therapeutic agents and chemical probes. There is also a need for the<br>
development oi thyromimetic compounds that are more accessible than the natural hormone<br>
and have potentially useful receptor binding and activation properties.<br>
Thyroid hormone receptor preferentially binds 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), a<br>
hormone analogue derived by tissue deiodination of circulating L-thyroxine (T4). However,<br>
the ability of T4 and T3 to activate intracellular signal transduction cascades, independently<br>
of TR, has recently been described by several laboratories. Acting independently of TR,<br>
thyroid hormone also modulates activity of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, <br>
stimulable ATPase, several other ion pumps or channels, and GTPase activity of<br>
synaptosomes. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated the ability of thyroid<br>
hormone to activate the MAPK signal transduction cascade. These pathways typically are<br>
activated by physical and chemical signals at the cell surface. Although the kinetics and<br>
analog specificity for binding of thyroid hormone to the plasma membrane have been<br>
repeatedly reported, a cell surface receptor that accounts for these TR-dependent actions for<br>
thyroid hormone has not been previously identified.<br>
Our laboratory has shown in the CV-1 monkey fibroblast cell line, which lacks<br>
functional TR, and in other cells that T4 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase<br>
(MAPK; ERK112) signaling cascade and promotes the phosphorylation and nuclear<br>
translocation of MAPK as early as lOmin following application of a physiological<br>
concentration of T4. In nuclear fractions of thyroid hormone-treated cells, we have<br>
described complexes of activated MAPK and transactivator nucleoproteins that are<br>
substrates for the serine kinase activity of MAPK. These proteins include signal transducer<br>
and activator of transcription (STAT)-la, STAT3, p53, estrogen receptor (ER)-a and, in<br>
cells containing TR, the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor for T3 (TRpl). Thyroid<br>
hormone-directed MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins enhances their<br>
transcriptional capabilities. The effects of T4- induced MAPK activation are blocked by<br>
inhibitors of the MAPK signal transduction pathway and by tetraiodothyroacetic acid<br>
(tetrac), a thyroid hormone analog which inhibits Tq binding to the cell surface. Thyroid<br>
hormone-activated MAPK may also act locally at the plasma membrane, e.g., on the<br>
N"VH+antiporter, rather than when translocated to the cell nucleus. A cell surface receptor<br>
for T4, that is linked to activation of the MAPK cascade has not previously been identified.<br>
Integrins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that form noncovalent<br>
heterodimers. Extracellular domains of the integrals interact with a variety of ligands,<br>
including extracellular matrix glycoproteins, and the intracellular domain is linked to the<br>
cytoskeleton. Thyroid hormone was shown a decade ago to influence the interaction of<br>
integrin with the extracellular matrix protein, laminin, but the mechanism was not known.<br>
Integrin aV(33 has a large number of extracellular protein ligands, including growth factors,<br>
and upon ligand-binding can activate the MAPK cascade. Several of the integrins contain<br>
an Arg-Gly-Asp ("RGD") recognition site that is important to the liganding of matrix and<br>
other extracellular proteins that contain an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to identify and provide an initiation site for the induction<br>
of MAPK signaling cascades in cells treated with thyroid hormones, or analogs and<br>
polymers thereof, thereby providing for methods of modulating growth factors and other<br>
polypeptides whose cell surface receptors clustered around this initiation site.<br>
It is estimated that five million people are afflicted with chronic stable angina in the<br>
United States. Each year 200,000 people under the age of 65 die with what is termed<br>
"premature ischemic heart disease." Despite medical therapy, many go on to suffer<br>
myocardial infarction and debilitating symptoms prompting the need for revascularization<br>
with either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass<br>
surgery. It has been postulated that one way of relieving myocardial ischemia would be to<br>
enhance coronary collateral circulation.<br>
Correlations have now been made between the anatomic appearance of coronary<br>
collateral vessels ("collaterals") visualized at the time of intracoronary thrombolitic therapy<br>
during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and the creatine kinase time-activity curve,<br>
infarct size, and aneurysm formation. These studies demonstrate a protective role of<br>
collaterals in hearts with coronary obstructive disease, showing smaller infarcts, less<br>
aneurysm formation, and improved ventricular function compared with patients in whom<br>
collaterals were not visualized. When the cardiac myocyte is rendered ischemic, collaterals<br>
develop actively by growth with DNA replication and mitosis of endothelial and smooth<br>
muscle cells. Once ischemia develops, these factors are activated and become available for<br>
receptor occupation, which may initiate angiogenesis after exposure to exogenous heparin.<br>
Unfortunately, the "natural" process by which angiogenesis occurs is inadequate to reverse<br>
the ischemia in almost all patients with coronary artery disease.<br>
During ischemia, adenosine is released through the breakdown of ATP. Adenosine<br>
participates in many cardio-protective biological events. Adenosine has a role in<br>
hemodynamic changes such as bradycardia and vasodilation, and adenosine has been<br>
suggested to have a role in such unrelated phenomena as preconditioning and possibly the<br>
reduction in reperfusion injury (Ely and Berne, Circulation, 85: 893 (1992).<br>
Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from preexisting blood<br>
vessels (Mousa, S. A., In Angiogenesis Inhibitors and Stimulators: Potential Thierapeutic<br>
Implications,, Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, Texas; Chapter 1, (2000)). Physiologically,<br>
angiogenesis ensures proper development of mature organisms, prepares the womb for egg<br>
implantation, and plays a key role in wound healing. The development of vascular<br>
networks during embryogenesis or normal and pathological angiogenesis depends on<br>
growth factors and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (Breier et al., Trends in<br>
Cell Biology 6:454-456 (1996); Folkman, Nature Medicine 1:27-31 (1995); Risau, Nature<br>
386:671-674 (1997). Blood vessels arise during embryogenesis by two processes:<br>
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (Blood etal., Bioch. Biophys. Acta 1032:89-118 (1990).<br>
Angiogenesis is a multi-step process controlled by the balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic<br>
factors. The latter stages of this process involve proliferation and the organization of<br>
endothelial cells (EC) into tube-like structures. Growth factors such as FGF2 and VEGF are<br>
thought to be key players in promoting endothelial cell growth and differentiation.<br>
Control of angiogenesis is a complex process involving local release of vascular<br>
growth factors (P Carmeliet, Ann NY Acad Sci 902:249-260, 2000), extracellular matrix,<br>
adhesion molecules and metabolic factors (RJ Tomanek, GC Schatteman, Anat Rec<br>
261:126-135, 2000). Mechanical forces within blood vessels may also play a role (O<br>
Hudlicka, Molec Cell Biochem 147:57-68,1995). The principal classes of endogenous<br>
growth factors implicated in new blood vessel growth are the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)<br>
family and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(G Pages, Ann NY Acad Sci<br>
902:187-200, 2000). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) signal<br>
transduction cascade is involved both in VEGF gene expression and in control of<br>
proliferation of vascular endothelial cells.<br>
Intrinsic adenosine may facilitate the coronary flow response to increased<br>
myocardial oxygen demands and so modulate the coronary flow reserve (Ethier et al., Am.<br>
J. Physiol., HI 31 (1993) demonstrated that the addition of physiological concentrations of<br>
adenosine to human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures stimulates proliferation,<br>
possibly via a surface receptor. Adenosine may be a factor for human endothelial cell<br>
growth and possibly angiogenesis. Angiogenesis appears to be protective for patients with<br>
obstructive blood flow such as coronary artery disease ("CAD"), but the rate at which blood<br>
vessels grow naturally is inadequate to reverse the disease. Thus, strategies to enhance and<br>
accelerate the body's natural angiogenesis potential should be beneficial in patients with<br>
CAD.<br>
Similarly, wound healing is a major problem in many developing countries and<br>
diabetics have impaired wound healing and chronic inflammatory disorders, with increased<br>
use of various cyclooxygenase-2 (CoX2) inhibitors. Angiogenesis is necessary for wound<br>
repair since the new vessels provide nutrients to support the active cells, promote<br>
granulation tissue formation and facilitate the clearance of debris. Approximately 60% of<br>
the granulation tissue mass is composed of blood vessels which also supply the necessary<br>
oxygen to stimulate repair and vessel growth. It is well documented that angiogenic factors<br>
are present in wound fluid and promote repair while antiangiogenic factors inhibit repair.<br>
Wound angiogenesis is a complex multi-step process. Despite a detailed knowledge about<br>
many angiogenic factors, little progress has been made in defining the source of these<br>
factors, the regulatory events involved in wound angiogenesis and in the clinical use of<br>
angiogenic stimulants to promote repair. Further complicating the understanding of wound<br>
angiogenesis and repair is the fact that the mechanisms and mediators involved in repair<br>
likely vary depending on the depth of the wound, type of wound (burn, trauma, etc.), and<br>
the location (muscle, skin, bone, etc.). The condition and age of the patient (diabetic,<br>
paraplegic, on steroid therapy, elderly vs infant, etc) can also determine the rate of repair<br>
and response to angiogenic factors. The sex of the patient and hormonal status<br>
(premenopausal, post menopausal, etc.) may also influence the repair mechanisms and<br>
responses. Impaired wound healing particularly affects the elderly and many of the 14<br>
million diabetics in the United States. Because reduced angiogenesis is often a causative<br>
agent for wound healing problems in these patient populations, it is important to define the<br>
angiogenic factors important in wound repair and to develop clinical uses to prevent and/or<br>
correct impaired wound healing.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for an effective therapy in the way of angiogenic agents<br>
as either primary or adjunctive therapy for promotion of wound healing, coronary<br>
angiogenesis, or other angiogenic-related disorders, with minimum side effects. Such a<br>
therapy would be particularly useful for patients who have vascular disorders such as<br>
myocardial infarctions, stroke or peripheral artery diseases and could be used<br>
prophylactically in patients who have poor coronary circulation, which places them at high<br>
risk of ischemia and myocardial infarctions.<br>
Thyroid hormones, analogs, and polymeric conjugations play important roles in the<br>
development of the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that the deprivation of polymeric<br>
thyroid hormones in the early developmental stage causes structural and functional deficits<br>
in the CNS, but the precise mechanism underlying this remains elusive.<br>
The mammalian nervous system comprises a peripheral nervous system (PNS) and a<br>
central nervous system (CNS, comprising the brain and spinal cord), and is composed of<br>
two principal classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. The glial cells fill the spaces between<br>
neurons, nourishing them and modulating their function. Certain glial cells, such as<br>
Schwann cells in the PNS and oligodendrocytes in the CNS, also provide a myelin sheath<br>
that surrounds neural processes. The myelin sheath enables rapid conduction along the<br>
neuron. In the peripheral nervous system, axons of multiple neurons may bundle together in<br>
order to form a nerve fiber. These, in turn, may be combined into fascicles or bundles.<br>
During development, differentiating neurons from the central and peripheral nervous<br>
systems send out axons mat grow and make contact with specific target cells. In some cases,<br>
axons must cover enormous distances; some grow into the periphery, whereas others are<br>
confined within the central nervous system. In mammals, this stage of neurogenesis is<br>
complete during the embryonic phase of life and neuronal cells do not multiply once they<br>
have fully differentiated.<br>
A host of neuropathies have been identified that affect the nervous system. The<br>
neuropathies, which may affect neurons themselves or associated glial cells, may result<br>
from cellular metabolic dysfunction, infection, exposure to toxic agents, autoimmunity,<br>
malnutrition, or ischemia. In some cases, the cellular neuropathy is thought to induce cell<br>
death directly. In other cases, the neuropathy may induce sufficient tissue necrosis to<br>
stimulate the body's immune/inflammatory system and the immune response to the initial<br>
injury then destroys neural pathways.<br>
Where the damaged neural pathway results from CNS axonal damage, autologous<br>
peripheral nerve grafts have been used to bridge lesions in the central nervous system and to<br>
allow axons to make it back to their normal target area. In contrast to CNS neurons, neurons<br>
of the peripheral nervous system can extend new peripheral processes in response to axonal<br>
damage. This regenerative property of peripheral nervous system axons is thought to be<br>
sufficient to allow grafting of these segments to CNS axons. Successful grafting appears to<br>
be limited, however, by a number of factors, including the length of the CNS axonal lesion<br>
to be bypassed, and the distance of the graft sites from the CNS neuronal cell bodies, with<br>
successful grafts occurring near the cell body.<br>
Within the peripheral nervous system, this cellular regenerative property of neurons<br>
has limited ability to repair function to a damaged neural pathway. Specifically, the new<br>
axons extend randomly, and are often misdirected, making contact with inappropriate<br>
targets that can cause abnormal function. For example, if a motor nerve is damaged,<br>
regrowing axons may contact the wrong muscles, resulting in paralysis. In addition, where<br>
severed nerve processes result in a gap of longer than a few millimeters, e.g., greater than<br>
10 millimeters (mm), appropriate nerve regeneration does not occur, either because the<br>
processes fail to grow the necessary distance, or because of misdirected axonal growth.<br>
Efforts to repair peripheral nerve damage by surgical means has met with mixed results,<br>
particularly where damage extends over a significant distance. In some cases, the suturing<br>
steps used to obtain proper alignment of severed nerve ends stimulates the formulation of<br>
scar tissue which is thought to inhibit axon regeneration. Even where scar tissue formation<br>
has been reduced, as with the use of nerve guidance channels or other tubular prostheses,<br>
successful regeneration generally still is limited to nerve damage of less than 10 millimeters<br>
in distance. In addition, the reparative ability of peripheral neurons is significantly inhibited<br>
where an injury or neuropathy affects the cell body itself or results in extensive<br>
degeneration of a distal axon.<br>
Mammalian neural pathways also are at risk due to damage caused by neoplastic<br>
lesions. Neoplasias of both the neurons and glial cells have been identified. Transformed<br>
cells of neural origin generally lose their ability to behave as normal differentiated cells and<br>
can destroy neural pathways by loss of function. In addition, the proliferating tumors may<br>
induce lesions by distorting normal nerve tissue structure, inhibiting pathways by<br>
compressing nerves, inhibiting cerbrospinal fluid or blood supply flow, and/or by<br>
stimulating the body's immune response. Metastatic tumors, which are a significant cause of<br>
neoplastic lesions in the brain and spinal cord, also similarly may damage neural pathways<br>
and induce neuronal cell death.<br>
One type of morphoregulatory molecule associated with neuronal cell growth,<br>
differentiation and development is the cell adhesion molecule ("CAM"), most notably the<br>
nerve cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). The CAMs are members the immunoglobulin<br>
super-family. They mediate cell—cell interactions in developing and adult tissues through<br>
homophilic binding, i.e., CAM-CAM binding on apposing cells. A number of different<br>
CAMs have been identified. Of these, the most thoroughly studied are N-CAM and L-CAM<br>
(liver cell adhesion molecules), both of which have been identified on all cells at early<br>
stages of development, as well as in different adult tissues. In neural tissue development, NCAM<br>
expression is believed to be important in tissue organization, neuronal migration,<br>
nerve-muscle tissue adhesion, retinal formation, synaptogenesis, and neural degeneration.<br>
Reduced N-CAM expression also is thought to be associated with nerve dysfunction. For<br>
example, expression of at least one form of N-CAM, N-CAM-180, is reduced in a mouse<br>
demyelinating mutant. Bhat, Brain Res. 452: 373-377 (1988). Reduced levels of N-CAM<br>
also have been associated with normal pressure hydrocephalus, Werdelin, Acta Neurol.<br>
Scand. 79: 177-181 (1989), and with type II schizophrenia. Lyons, et al., Biol. Psychiatry<br>
23: 769-775 (1988). In addition, antibodies against N-CAM have been shown to disrupt<br>
functional recovery in injured nerves. Remsen, Exp. Neurobiol. 110: 268-273 (1990).<br>
Currently no satisfactory method exists to repair the damage caused by traumatic<br>
injuries of motor neurons and diseases of motor neurons. There are 15,000 to 18,000 new<br>
cases of spinal cord injury each year in the United States. In addition, there are<br>
approximately 200,000 survivors of spinal cord injury. The annual cost of care for these<br>
patients exceeds $7 billion. The pathophysiology following acute spinal cord trauma is a<br>
complex and not fully understood mechanism. The primary tissue damage caused by<br>
mechanical trauma occurs immediately and is irreversible. Allen, J. Am. Med. Assoc. 57:<br>
878-880 (1911). Experimental evidence indicates that much of the post-traumatic tissue<br>
damage is the result of a reactive process that begins within minutes after the injury and<br>
continues for days or weeks. Janssen, et al., Spine 14: 23-32 (1989) and Panter, et al.,<br>
(1992). This progressive, self-destructive process includes pathophysiological mechanisms<br>
such as hemorrhage, post-traumatic ischemia, edema, axonal and neuronal necrosis, and<br>
demyelinization followed by cyst formation and infarction. For review, see Tator, et al., J.<br>
Neurosurg, 75: 15-26 (1991) and Faden, Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 7: 175-186 (1993). Proposed<br>
injurious factors include electrolyte changes whereby increased intracellular calcium<br>
initiates a cascade of events (Young, J. Neurotrauma 9, Suppl. 1: S9-S25 (1992) and Young,<br>
J. Emerg. Med 11: 13-22 (1993)), biochemical changes with uncontrolled transmitter<br>
release (Liu, et al., Cell 66: 807-815 (1991) and Yanase, et al., J. Neurosurg 83: 884-888<br>
(1995), arachidonic acid release, free-radical production, lipid peroxidation (Braughler, et<br>
al., J. Neurotrauma 9, Suppl. 1: S1-S7 (1992), eicosanoid production (Demediuk, et al., J.<br>
Neurosci. Res. 20: 115-121 (1988), endogenous opioids (Faden, et al., Ann Neurol. 17: 386-<br>
390 (1985), metabolic changes including alterations in oxygen and glucose (Faden, Crit.<br>
Rev. Neurobiol. 7: 175-186 (1993)), inflammatory changes (Blight, J. Neurotrauma 9,<br>
Suppl. 1: S83-S91 (1992), and astrocytic edema (Kimelberg, J. Neurorrauma 9, Suppl. 1:<br>
S71-S81 (1992). For the past 400 years surgical approaches including laminectomy and<br>
decompression, accompanied by fusion, have been the most commonly practiced treatment<br>
strategies. Hansebout, "Early Management of Acute Spinal Cord Injury", pp. 181-196<br>
(1982) and Janssen, et al., Spine 14: 23-32 (1989). However, these procedures have not<br>
involved the application of techniques to augment the regenerative properties of spinal cord<br>
tissue.<br>
A host of diseases of motor neurons have been identified, including demyelinating<br>
diseases, myelopathies, and diseases of motor neurons such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<br>
("ALS"). INTERNAL MEDICINE, ch. 121-123 (4th ed., J. H. Stein, ed., Mosby, 1994).<br>
Multiple sclerosis ("MS") is the most common demyelinating disorder of the central<br>
nervous system, causing patches of sclerosis (i.e., plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. MS<br>
has protean clinical manifestations, depending upon the location and size of the plaque.<br>
Typical symptoms include visual loss, diplopia, nystagmus, dysarthria, weakness,<br>
paresthesias, bladder abnormalities, and mood alterations. Myriad treatments have been<br>
proposed for this long-term variable illness. The list of proposed treatments encompasses<br>
everything from diet to electrical stimulation to acupuncture, emotional support, and various<br>
forms of immunosupressive therapy. None have proved to be satisfactory.<br>
Progressive loss of lower and upper motor neurons occurs in several diseases (e.g.,<br>
primary lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, benign focal amyotrophy). However,<br>
ALS is the most common form of motor neuron disease. Loss of both lower and upper<br>
motor neurons occur in ALS. Symptoms include progressive skeletal muscle wasting,<br>
weakness, gasciculations, and cramping. Some cases have predominant involvement of<br>
brainstem motoneurons (progressive bulbar palsy). Unfortunately, treatment of motor<br>
neuron and related diseas is largely supportive at this time. INTERNAL MEDICINE, ch.<br>

Accordingly, there is a need in the art for treatments of motor neurons disorders and<br>
injuries, and related deficits in neural functions. It is, therefore, an object of the present<br>
invention to provide compositions and methods for stimulating angiogenesis, for inducing<br>
neuronal differentiation, and for preventing the death or degeneration of neuronal cells.<br>
The tyrosines are iodinated at one (monoiodotyrosine) or two (diiodotyrosine) sites<br>
and then coupled to form the active hormones (diiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine -»<br>
tetraiodothyronine [thyroxine, T4]; diiodotyrosine + monoiodotyrosine -&gt;triiodothyronine<br>
[Ta]. Another source of Ta within the thyroid gland is the result of the outer ring<br>
deiodination of T4 by a selenoenzyme: type I 5r-deiodinase (5'D-I). Thyroglobulin, a<br>
glycoprotein containing Ta and T4 within its matrix, is taken up from the follicle as colloid<br>
droplets by the thyroid cells.<br>
Lysosoraes containing proteases cleave T3 and T4 from thyroglobulin, resulting in<br>
release of free T3 and T4. The iodotyrosines (monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine) are also<br>
released from thyroglobulin, but only very small amounts reach the bloodstream. Iodine is<br>
removed from them by intracellular deiodinases, and this iodine is used by the thyroid<br>
gland.<br>
The T4 and Ta released from the thyroid by proteolysis reach the bloodstream, where<br>
they are bound to thyroid hormone-binding serum proteins for transport. The major thyroid<br>
hormone-binding protein is thyroxine-binding globulin ("TBG"), which has high affinity<br>
but low capacity for T4 and T3. TBG normally accounts for about 75% of the bound<br>
hormones. Other thyroid hormone-binding proteins—primarily thyroxine-binding<br>
prealbumin, also called transthyretin ("TTR"), which has high affinity but low capacity for<br>
T4, and albumin, which has low affinity but high capacity for T4 and T3—account for the<br>
remainder of the bound serum thyroid hormones. About 0.03% of the total serum T4 and<br>
0.3% of the total serum Ta are free and in equilibrium with the bound hormones. Only free<br>
T4 and T3 are available to the peripheral tissues for thyroid hormone action.<br>
Thyroid hormones have two major physiologic effects: (1) They increase protein<br>
synthesis in virtually every body tissue. (T3 and T4 enter cells, where Ta, which is derived<br>
from the circulation and from conversion of T4 to Ta within the cell, binds to discrete<br>
nuclear receptors and influences the formation of mRNA.) (2) Ta increases QI consumption<br>
by increasing the activity of the Na+, K+-ATPase (Na pump), primarily in tissues<br>
responsible for basal O2 consumption (ie, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle). The<br>
increased activity of Na+, K+-ATPase is secondary to increased synthesis of this enzyme;<br>
therefore, the increased O2 consumption is also probably related to the nuclear binding of<br>
thyroid hormones. However, a direct effect of Ta on the mitochondrion has not been ruled<br>
out. T3 is believed to be the active thyroid hormone, although T4 itself may be biologically<br>
active.<br>
The pool of thyroid hormones critical for the biological actions of the hormones is<br>
the pool of free thyroid hormone. The size of this pool is determined for short time periods<br>
by uptake/release of thyroid hormones into/from cell and binding/release of thyroid<br>
hormones by thyroid hormone-binding proteins. Both proportions and absolute<br>
concentrations of these proteins differ in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF"). The<br>
most pronounced difference is found for transthyretin ("TTR"), which is the only thyroid<br>
hormone-binding plasma protein synthesized in the brain (Schreiber G, Southwell BR,<br>
Richardson SJ. Hormone delivery systems to the brain-transthyretin. Exp Clin Endocrinol<br>
Diabetes. 1995;103(2):75-80). TTR is also distinct from the other two thyroid hormonebinding<br>
plasma proteins in humans by the absence of generic deficiencies. TTR gene<br>
expression was initiated during evolution much earlier in the brain than in the liver. The<br>
structure of the domains of TTR involved in thyroxine (TR) T4 binding has been<br>
completely conserved for 350 million years. These observations point to a special functional<br>
significance of TTR in the brain. It is proposed that this is the determination of the level of<br>
free T4 in the extracellular compartment of the brain. T4 can then be converted in the brain<br>
to triiodothyronine T3 by specific deiodinases. This T3 can interact with receptors in the<br>
cell nuclei, regulating gene transcription.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder, and currently about 4<br>
million Americans suffer from this disease. As the aging population continues to grow, this<br>
number could reach 14 million by the middle of next century unless a cure or prevention is<br>
found. At present, there is no sensitive and specific premortem test for early diagnosis of<br>
this disease. Alzheimer's disease is currently diagnosed based on the clinical observation of<br>
cognitive decline, coupled with the systematic elimination of other possible causes of those<br>
symptoms. The confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of "probable Alzheimer's disease" can<br>
only be made by examination of the postmortem brain. The Alzheimer's disease brain is<br>
characterized by the appearance of two distinct abnormal proteinaceous deposits in regions<br>
of the brain responsible for learning and memory (e.g., cerebral cortex and hippocampus).<br>
These deposits are extracellular amyloid plaques, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's<br>
disease, and intracellular neurofibillary tangles ("NFTs"), which can be found in other<br>
neurodegenerative disorders as well. Amyloid peptides are typically either 40 or 42 ammo<br>
acids in length ("AMO" or "A1"42", respectively) and are formed from abnormal processing<br>
of a larger membrane-associated protein of unknown function, the amyloid precurser<br>
protein ("APP"). Oligomeric aggregates of these peptides are thought to be neurotoxic,<br>
eventually resulting in synaptic degeneration and neuronal loss. The amount of amyloid<br>
deposition roughly correlates with the severity of symptoms at the time of death.<br>
In the past, there have been several attempts for the design of radiopharmaceuticals<br>
that could be used as diagnostic agents for a premortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Bornebroek et al. showed that the amyloid-associated protein serum amyloid P component<br>
(SAP), labeled with 123I, accumulates at low levels in the cerebral cortex, possibly in vessel<br>
walls, of patients with cerebral amyloidosis (Bomebroek, M., et al., Nucl. Med. Comnum.<br>
(1996), Vol. 17, pp. 929-933).<br>
Saito et al. proposed a vector-mediated delivery of 123I -labeled A1"40 through the<br>
blood-brain barrier. It is reported that the iodinated A1"40 binds A amyloid plaque in tissue<br>
sections (Saito, Y., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1995, Vol. 92, pp. 10227-10231). U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,231,000 discloses antibodies with specificity to A4 amyloid polypeptide found in<br>
the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. However, a method to deliver these antibodies<br>
across the blood-brain barrier has not been described. Zhen et al. described modifications<br>
of the amyloid-binding dye known as "Congo Red.TM.", and complexes of these modified<br>
molecules with technetium and rhenium. The complexes with radioactive ions are purported<br>
to be potential imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease (Zhen et al., J. Med. Chem. (1999),<br>
Vol. 42, pp. 2805-2815). However, the potential of the complexes to cross the blood-brain<br>
barrier is limited.<br>
A group at the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S.A. (Skovronsky, M., et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000, Vol. 97, pp. 7609-7614) has developed a fluorescently^abeled<br>
derivative of Congo Red that is brain permeable and that non-specifically binds to amyloid<br>
materials (that is, peptides in-pleated sheet conformation). This compound would need to be<br>
radiolabeled and then run through pre-clinical screens for pharmacokinetics and toxicity<br>
before clinical testing. In contrast, our invention utilizes derivatives of naturally occurring<br>
substances alone or in combinations for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of<br>
Alzheimer's disease. Klunk et al. reported experiments with a derivative of Congo<br>
Red.TM., Chrysamine G ("CG"). It is reported that CG binds synthetic-amyloid well in<br>
vitro, and crosses the blood-brain barrier in normal mice (Klunk et al., Neurobiol. Aging<br>
(1994), Vol. 15, No. 6, pp. 691-698). Bergstrom et al. presented a compound labeled with<br>
!23I as a potential radioligand for visualization of Ml and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine<br>
receptors in Alzheimer's disease (Bergstrom et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med. (1999), Vol. 26, pp.<br>
1482-1485).<br>
Recently, it has been discovered that certain specific chemokine receptors are<br>
upregulated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (Horuk, R. et al., J. Immunol.<br>
(1997), Vol. 158, pp. 2882-2890); Xia et al., J. NeuroVirol (1999), Vol. 5, pp. 32-41). In<br>
addition, it has been recently shown that the chemokine receptor CCR1 is upregulated in the<br>
brains of patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease and absent in normal-aged brains<br>
(Halks-Miller et al, CCR1 Immunoreactiviry in Alzheimer's Disease Brains, Society for<br>
Neuroscience Meeting Abstract, #787.6, Volume 24, 1998). Antagonists to the CCR1<br>
receptor and their use as anti-inflammatory agents are described in the PCT Published<br>
Patent Application, WO 98/56771.<br>
None of the above described proposals have resulted in a clinical development of an<br>
imaging agent for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, there is still a<br>
clinical need for a diagnostic agent that could be used for a reliable and early diagnosis of<br>
Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the proposed strategies would also be useful for the<br>
inhibition of amyloid plaque formation or buildup in Alzheimer patients. Accordingly, it is<br>
an object of the present invention to provide compositions and methods for the early<br>
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, sucli as, for example<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
It is interesting to note that angiogenesis also occurs in other situations, but which<br>
are undesirable, including solid tumour growth and metastasis; rheumatoid arthritis;<br>
psoriasis; scleroderma; and three common causes of blindness - diabetic retinopathy,<br>
retrolental fibroplasia and neovascular glaucoma (in fact, diseases of the eye are almost<br>
always accompanied by vascularization. The process of wound angiogenesis actually has<br>
many features in common with rumour angiogenesis. Thus, there are some conditions, such<br>
as diabetic retinopathy or the occurrence of primary or metastatic tumors, where<br>
angiogenesis is undesirable. Thus, there remains a need for methods by which to inhibit the<br>
effect of angiogenic agents for the treatment of cancers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that thyroid hormone, thyroid<br>
hormone analogs, and their polymeric forms, act at the cell membrane level and have proangiogenic<br>
properties that are independent of the nuclear thyroid hormone effects.<br>
Accordingly, these thyroid hormone analogs and polymeric forms (i.e., angiogenic agents)<br>
can be used to treat a variety of disorders. Similarly, the invention is also based on the<br>
discovery that thyroid hormone analog antagonists inhibit the pro-angiogenic effect of such<br>
analogs, and can also be used to treat a variety of disorders.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect the invention features methods for treating a condition<br>
amenable to treatment by promoting angiogenesis by administering to a subject in need<br>
thereof an amount of a polymeric form of thyroid hormone, or an analog thereof, effective<br>
for promoting angiogenesis. Examples of such conditions amenable to treatment by<br>
promoting angiogenesis are provided herein and can include occlusive vascular disease,<br>
coronary disease, erectile dysfunction, myocardial infarction, ischemia, stroke, peripheral<br>
artery vascular disorders, and wounds.<br>
Examples of thyroid hormone analogs are also provided herein and can include<br>
triiodothyronine (T3), levothyroxine (T4), 3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)-<br>
phenoxy acetic acid (GC-1), or 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), tetraiodothyroacetic<br>
acid (TETRAC), and triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC). Additional analogs are in Figure 20<br>
Tables A-D. Thes analogs can be conjugated to polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic acid ethylene copolymer,<br>
polylactic acid, or agarose. The conjugation is via covalent or non-covalent bonds<br>
depending on the polymer used.<br>
In one embodiment the thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone analogs, or polymeric<br>
forms thereof are administered by parenteral, oral, rectal, or topical means, or combinations<br>
thereof. Parenteral modes of administration include, for example, subcutaneous,<br>
intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or intravenous modes, such as by catheter. Topical modes of<br>
administration can include, for example, a band-aid.<br>
In another embodiment, the thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone analogs, or<br>
polymeric forms thereof can be encapsulated or incorporated in a microparticle, liposome,<br>
or polymer. The polymer can include, for example, polyglycolide, polylactide, or copolymers<br>
thereof. The liposome or microparticle has a size of about less than 200<br>
nanometers, and can be administered via one or more parenteral routes, or another mode of<br>
administration. In another embodiment the liposome or microparticle can be lodged in<br>
capillary beds surrounding ischemic tissue, or applied to the inside of a blood vessel via a<br>
catheter.<br>
Thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone analogs, or polymeric forms thereof according<br>
to the invention can also be co-administered with one or more biologically active substances<br>
that can include, for example, growth factors, vasodilators, anti-coagulants, anti-virals, antibacterials,<br>
anti-inflammatories, immuno-suppressants, analgesics, vascularizing agents, or<br>
cell adhesion molecules, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the thyroid hormone<br>
analog or polymeric form is administered as a bolus injection prior to or post-administering<br>
one or more biologically active substance.<br>
Growth factors can include, for example, transforming growth factor alpha<br>
("TGFa"), transforming growth factor beta ("TGFp"), basic fibroblast growth factor,<br>
vascular endothelial gro\vth factor, epithelial growth factor, nerve growth factor, plateletderived<br>
growth factor, and vascular permeability factor. Vasodilators can include, for<br>
example, adenosine, adenosine derivatives, or combinations thereof. Anticoagulants<br>
include, but are not limited to, heparin, heparin derivatives, anti-factor Xa, anti-thrombin,<br>
aspirin, clopidgrel, or combinations thereof.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, methods are provided for promoting angiogenesis along<br>
or around a medical device by coating the device with a thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone<br>
analog, or polymeric form thereof according to the invention prior to inserting the device<br>
into a patient. The coating step can further include coating the device with one or more<br>
biologically active substance, such as, but not limited to, a growth factor, a vasodilator, an<br>
anti-coagulant, or combinations thereof. Examples of medical devices that can be coated<br>
with thyroid hormone analogs or polymeric forms according to the invention include stents,<br>
catheters, cannulas or electrodes.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a condition amenable<br>
to treatment by inhibiting angiogenesis by administering to a subject in need thereof an<br>
amount of an anti-angiogenesis agent effective for inhibiting angiogenesis. Examples of the<br>
conditions amenable to treatment by inhibiting angiogenesis include, but are not limited to,<br>
primary or metastatic tumors, diabetic retinopathy, and related conditions. Examples of the<br>
anti-angiogenesis agents used for inhibiting angiogenesis are also provided by the invention<br>
and include, but are not limited to, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (TETRAC), triiodothyroacetic<br>
acid (TRIAC), monoclonal antibody LM609, XT 199 or combinations thereof. Such antiangiogenesis<br>
agents can act at the cell surface to inhibit the pro-angiogenesis agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the anti-angiogenesis agent is administered by a parenteral, oral,<br>
rectal, or topical mode, or combination thereof. In another embodiment, the antiangiogenesis<br>
agent can be co-administered with one or more anti-angiogenesis therapies or<br>
chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention provides compositions (i.e., angiogenic agents)<br>
that include thyroid hormone, and analogs conjugated to a polymer. The conjugation can be<br>
through a covalent or non-covalent bond, depending on the polymer. A covalent bond can<br>
occur through an ester or anhydride linkage, for example. Examples of the thyroid hormone<br>
analogs are also provided by the instant invention and include levothyroxine (T4),<br>
triiodothyronine (T3), 3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid<br>
 (GC-1), or 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA). In one embodiment, the polymer can<br>
include, but is not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic acid ethylene co-polymer, polylactic<br>
acid, or agarose.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides for pharmaceutical formulations including<br>
the angiogenic agents according to the present invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulations can also include one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention can be<br>
encapsulated or incorporated in a liposome, microparticle, or polymer. The liposome or<br>
microparticle has a size of less than about 200 nanometers. Any of the pharmaceutical<br>
formulations according to the present invention can be administered via parenteral, oral,<br>
rectal, or topical means, or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the<br>
pharmaceutical formulations can be co-administered to a subject in need thereof with one or<br>
more biologically active substances including, but not limited to, growth factors,<br>
vasodilators, anti-coagulants, or combinations thereof.<br>
In other aspects, the present invention concerns the use of the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs and pharmaceutical formulations containing said hormone, for the<br>
restoration of neuronal functions and enhancing survival of neural cells. For the purpose of<br>
the present invention, neuronal function is taken to mean the collective physiological,<br>
biochemical and anatomic mechanisms that allow development of the nervous system<br>
during the embryonic and postnatal periods and that, in the adult animal, is the basis of<br>
regenerative mechanisms for damaged neurons and of the adaptive capability of the central<br>
nervous system when some parts of it degenerate and can not regenerate.<br>
Therefore, the following processes occur in order to achieve neuronal function:<br>
denervation, reinnervation, synaptogenesis, synaptic repression, synaptic expansion, the<br>
sprouting of axons, neural regeneration, development and organisation of neural paths and<br>
circuits to replace the damaged ones. Therefore, the suitable patients to be treated with the<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs or combinations thereof according to the present<br>
invention are patients afflicted with degenerative pathologies of the central nervous system<br>
(senile dementia like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism, Huntington's chorea, cerebellarspinal<br>
adrenoleucodystrophy), trauma and cerebral ischemia.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, methods of the invention for treating motor neuron<br>
defects, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury<br>
comprise administering a polymeric thyroid hormone analog , or combinations thereof, and<br>
in combination with growth factors, nerve growth factors, or other pro-angiogenesis or<br>
neurogenesis factors. Spinal cord injuries include injuries resulting from a tumor,<br>
mechanical trauma, and chemical trauma. The same or similar methods are contemplated to<br>
restore motor function in a mammal having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis,<br>
or a spinal cord injury. Administering one of the aforementioned polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors also provides a prophylactic function. Such administration has the effect of<br>
preserving motor function in a mammal having, or at risk of having, amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or a spinal cord injury. Also according to the invention,<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors administration preserves the integrity of the nigrostriatal<br>
pathway.<br>
Specifically, methods of the invention for treating (pre- or post-symptomatically)<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or a spinal cord injury comprise<br>
administering a polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors. In a particularly-preferred embodiment, the<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors is a soluble complex, comprising at least one polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features compositions and therapeutic treatment<br>
methods comprising administering to a mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
morphogenic protein ("polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with<br>
nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors"), as defined herein, upon injury to a<br>
neural pathway, or in anticipation of such injury, for a time and at a concentration sufficient<br>
to maintain the neural pathway, including repairing damaged pathways, or inhibiting<br>
additional damage thereto.<br>
In another aspect, the invention features compositions and therapeutic treatment<br>
methods for maintaining neural pathways. Such treatment methods include administering to<br>
the mammal, upon injury to a neural pathway or in anticipation of such injury, a compound<br>
that stimulates a therapeutically effective concentration of an endogenous polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analog. These compounds are referred to herein as polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors-<br>
stimulating agents, and are understood to include substances which, when administered to a<br>
mammal, act on tissue(s) or orgari(s) that normally are responsible for, or capable of,<br>
producing a polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors and/or secreting a polymeric thyroid hormone analog<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, and which<br>
cause endogenous level of the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination<br>
with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors to be altered.<br>
In particular, the invention provides methods for protecting neurons from the tissue<br>
destructive effects associated with the body's immune and inflammatory response to nerve<br>
injury. The invention also provides methods for stimulating neurons to maintain their<br>
differentiated phenotype, including inducing the redifferentiation of transformed cells of<br>
neuronal origin to a morphology characteristic of untransformed neurons. In one<br>
embodiment, the invention provides means for stimulating production of cell adhesion<br>
molecules, particularly nerve cell adhesion molecules ("N-CAM"). The invention also<br>
provides methods, compositions and devices for stimulating cellular repair of damaged<br>
neurons and neural pathways, including regenerating damaged dendrites or axons. In<br>
addition, the invention also provides means for evaluating the status of nerve tissue, and for<br>
detecting and monitoring neuropathies by monitoring fluctuations in polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors levels.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors described herein are<br>
useful in repairing damaged neural pathways of the peripheral nervous system. In particular,<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors are useful for repairing damaged neural pathways, including<br>
transected or otherwise damaged nerve fibers. Specifically, the polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors<br>
described herein are capable of stimulating complete axonal nerve regeneration, including<br>
vascularization and reformation of the myelin sheath. Preferably, the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors are provided to the site of injury in a biocompatible, bioresorbable carrier capable of<br>
maintaining the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors at the site and, where necessary, means for<br>
directing axonal growth from the proximal to the distal ends of a severed neuron. For<br>
example, means for directing axonal growth may be required where nerve regeneration is to<br>
be induced over an extended distance, such as greater than 10 mm. Many carriers capable of<br>
providing these functions are envisioned. For example, useful carriers include substantially<br>
insoluble materials or viscous solutions prepared as disclosed herein comprising larninin,<br>
hyaluronic acid or collagen, or other suitable synthetic, biocompatible polymeric materials<br>
such as polylactic, polyglycolic or polybutyric acids and/or copolymers thereof. A preferred<br>
carrier comprises an extracellular matrix composition derived, for example, from mouse<br>
sarcoma cells.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone<br>
or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors is disposed in a<br>
nerve guidance channel which spans the distance of the damaged pathway. The channel acts<br>
both as a protective covering and a physical means for guiding growth of a neurite. Useful<br>
channels comprise a biocompatible membrane, which may be tubular in structure, having a<br>
dimension sufficient to span the gap in the nerve to be repaired, and having openings<br>
adapted to receive severed nerve ends. The membrane may be made of any biocompatible,<br>
nonirritating material, such as silicone or a biocompatible polymer, such as polyethylene or<br>
polyethylene vinyl acetate. The casing also may be composed of biocompatible,<br>
bioresorbable polymers, including, for example, collagen, hyaluronic acid, polylactic,<br>
polybutyric, and polyglycolic acids. In a preferred embodiment, the outer surface of the<br>
channel is substantially impermeable.<br>
The polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors may be disposed in the channel in association with a<br>
biocompatible carrier material, or it may be adsorbed to or otherwise associated with the<br>
inner surface of the casing, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,486, provided that<br>
the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors<br>
or other neurogenesis factors is accessible to the severed nerve ends.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors described herein are<br>
useful to protect against damage associated with the body's immune/inflarnrnatory response<br>
to an initial injury to nerve tissue. Such a response may follow trauma to nerve tissue,<br>
caused, for example, by an autoimmune dysfunction, neoplastic lesion, infection, chemical<br>
or mechanical trauma, disease, by interruption of blood flow to the neurons or glial cells, or<br>
by other trauma to the nerve or surrounding material. For example, the primary damage<br>
resulting from hypoxia or ischemia-reperfusion following occlusion of a neural blood<br>
supply, as in an embolic stroke, is believed to be immunologically associated. In addition, at<br>
least part of the damage associated with a number of primary brain tumors also appears to<br>
be immunologically related. Application of a polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, either directly or<br>
systemically alleviates and/or inhibits the immunologically related response to a neural<br>
injury. Alternatively, administration of an agent capable of stimulating the expression<br>
and/or secretion in vivo of polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination<br>
with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors expression, preferably at the site of<br>
injury, may also be used. Where the injury is to be induced, as during surgery or other<br>
aggressive clinical treatment, the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors or agent may be<br>
provided prior to induction of the injury to provide a neuroprotective effect to the nerve<br>
tissue at risk.<br>
Generally, polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors useful in methods and compositions of the<br>
invention are dimeric proteins that induce morphogenesis of one or more eukaryotic (e.g.,<br>
mammalian) cells, tissues or organs. Tissue morphogenesis includes de novo or regenerative<br>
tissue formation, such as occurs in a vertebrate embryo during development. Of particular<br>
interest are polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors that induce tissue-specific morphogenesis at least of<br>
bone or neural tissue. As defined herein, a polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors comprises a pair of<br>
polypeptides that, when folded, form a dimeric protein that elicits morphogenetic responses<br>
in cells and tissues displaying thyroid receptors. That is, the polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors<br>
generally induce a cascade of events including all of the following in a morphogenically<br>
permissive environment: stimulating proliferation of progenitor cells; stimulating the<br>
differentiation of progenitor cells; stimulating the proliferation of differentiated cells; and,<br>
supporting the growth and maintenance of differentiated cells. "Progenitor" cells are<br>
uncommitted cells that are competent to differentiate into one or more specific types of<br>
differentiated cells, depending on their genomic repertoire and the tissue specificity of the<br>
permissive environment in which morphogenesis is induced. An exemplary progenitor cell<br>
is a hematopoeitic stem cell, a mesenchymal stem cell, a basement epithelium cell, a neural<br>
crest cell, or the like. Further, polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination<br>
with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors can delay or mitigate the onset of<br>
senescence- or quiescence-associated loss of phenotype and/or tissue function. Still further,<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors can stimulate phenotypic expression of a differentiated cell type,<br>
including expression of metabolic and/or functional, e.g., secretory, properties thereof. In<br>
addition, polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factor or other neurogenesis factors can induce redifferentiation of committed cells (e.g.,<br>
osteoblasts, neuroblasts, or the like) under appropriate conditions. As noted above,<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors that induce proliferation and/or differentiation at least of bone or<br>
neural tissue, and/or support the growth, maintenance and/or functional properties of neural<br>
tissue, are of particular interest herein.<br>
Of particular interest are polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors which, when provided<br>
to a specific tissue of a mammal, induce tissue-specific morphogenesis or maintain the<br>
normal state of differentiation and growth of that tissue. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
present polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors induce the formation of vertebrate (e.g., avian or<br>
mammalian) body tissues, such as but not limited to nerve, eye, bone, cartilage, bone<br>
marrow, ligament, tooth dentin, periodontium, liver, kidney, lung, heart, or gastrointestinal<br>
lining. Preferred methods may be carried out in the context of developing embryonic tissue,<br>
or at an aseptic, unscarred wound site in post-embryonic tissue.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include compositions and methods of using thyroid<br>
hormone analogs and polymers thereof for imaging and diagnosis of neurodegenerative<br>
disorders, such as, for example, Alzheimer's disease. For example, in one aspect, the<br>
invention features T4 analogs that have a high specificity for target sites when administered<br>
to a subject in vivo. Preferred T4 analogs show a target to non-target ratio of at least 4:1, are<br>
stable in vivo and substantially localized to target within 1 hour after administration. In<br>
another aspect, the invention features pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a linker<br>
attached to the T4 analogs for Technetium, indium for gamma imaging using single photon<br>
emission ("SPECT") and with contrast agents for MRI imaging. Additionally, halogenated<br>
analogs that bind TfR can inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils and thus can be utilized<br>
for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Such compounds can also be used<br>
with positron emission tomography ("PET") imaging methods.<br>
In other aspects, the invention also includes compositions and methods for<br>
modulating actions of growth factors and other polypeptides whose cell surface receptors<br>
are clustered around integrin ctVpS, or other cell surface receptors containing the amino<br>
acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp ("ROD"). Polypeptides that can be modulated include, for<br>
example, insulin, insulin-like growth factors, epidermal growth factors, and interferon-y.<br>
The details of one or more embodiments of the invention have been set forth in the<br>
accompanying description below. Although any methods and materials similar or<br>
equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present<br>
invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. Other features, objects,<br>
and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and from the claims.<br>
In the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms include plural references<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and<br>
scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents and publications cited<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1. Effects of L-T4 and L-T3 on angiogenesis quantitated in the chick<br>
CAM assay. A, Control samples were exposed to PBS and additional samples to 1 nM T3<br>
or 0.1 umol/L T4 for 3 days. Both hormones caused increased blood vessel branching in<br>
these representative images from 3 experiments. B, Tabulation of mean ±SEM of new<br>
branches formed from existing blood vessels during the experimental period drawn from 3<br>
experiments, each of which included 9 CAM assays. At the concentrations shown, T3 and<br>
T4 caused similar effects (1.9-fold and 2.5-fold increases, respectively, in branch<br>
formation). **P
CAM samples,<br>
Figure 2. Tetrac inhibits stimulation of angiogenesis by T4 and agarose-linked<br>
T4 (T4-ag). A, A 2.5-fold increase in blood vessel branch formation is seen in a<br>
representative CAM preparation exposed to 0.1 umol/L T4 for 3 days. In 3 similar<br>
experiments, there was a 2.3-fold increase. This effect of the hormone is inhibited by tetrac<br>
(0.1 umol/L), a T4 analogue shown previously to inhibit plasma membrane actions of T4.13<br>
22<br>
Tetrac alone does not stimulate angiogenesis (C). B, T4-ag (0.1 umol/L) stimulates<br>
angiogenesis 2.3-fold (2.9-fold in 3 experiments), an effect also blocked by tetrac. C,<br>
Summary of the results of 3 experiments that examine the actions of tetrac, T4-ag, and T4 in<br>
the CAM assay. Data (means ±SEM) were obtained from 10 images for each experimental<br>
condition in each of 3 experiments. **P
agarose-treated samples with PBS-treated control samples.<br>
Figure 3. Comparison of the proangiogenic effects of FGF2 and T4. A, Tandem<br>
effects of T4 (0.05 umol/L) and FGF2 (0.5 iag/mL) in submaximal concentrations are<br>
additive in the CAM assay and equal the level of angiogenesis seen with FGF2 (1 ug/mL in<br>
the absence of T4). B, Summary of results from 3 experiments that examined actions of<br>
FGF2 arid T4 in the CAM assay (means ±SEM) as in A. *P
results of treated samples with those of PBS-treated control samples in 3 experiments.<br>
Figure 4. Effect of anti-FGF2 on angiogenesis caused by T4 or exogenous<br>
FGF2. A, FGF2 caused a 2-fold increase in angiogenesis in the CAM model in 3<br>
experiments, an effect inhibited by antibody (ab) to FGF2 (8 ug). T4 also stimulated<br>
angiogenesis 1.5-fold, and this effect was also blocked by FGF2 antibody, indicating that<br>
the action of thyroid hormone in the CAM model is mediated by an autocrine/paracrine<br>
effect of FGF2 because T4 and T3 cause FGF2 release from cells in the CAM model (Table<br>
1). We have shown previously mat a nonspecific IgG antibody has no effect on<br>
angiogenesis in the CAM assay. B, Summary of results from 3 CAM experiments mat<br>
studied the action of FGF2-ab in the presence of FGF2 or T4. *P
indicating significant effects in 3 experiments studying the effects of thyroid hormone and<br>
FGF2 on angiogenesis and loss of these effects in the presence of antibody to FGF2.<br>
Figure 5. Effect of PD 98059, a MAPK (ERK1/2) signal transaction cascade<br>
inhibitor, on angiogenesis induced by T4,T3, and FGF2. A, Angiogenesis stimulated by<br>
T4 (0.1 umol/L) and T3 (1 nmol/L) together is fully inhibited by PD 98059 (3 umol/L). B,<br>
Angiogenesis induced by FGF2 (1 fig/mL) is also inhibited by PD 98059, indicating that the<br>
action of the growth factor is also dependent on activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. In the<br>
context of the experiments involving T4-agarose (T4-ag) and tetrac (Figure2) indicating<br>
that T4 initiates its proangiogenic effect at the cell membrane, results shown in A and B are<br>
consistent with 2 roles played by MAPK in the proangiogenic action of thyroid hormone:<br>
ERK1/2 transduces the early signal of the hormone that leads to FGF2 elaboration and<br>
transduces the subsequent action of FGF2 on angiogenesis. C, Summary of results of 3<br>
experiments, represented by A and B, showing the effect of PD98059 on the actions of T4<br>
and FGF2 in the CAM model. *P

Figure 6. T4 and FGF2 activate MAPKin ECV304 endothelial cells. Cells were<br>
prepared in Ml 99 medium with 0.25% hormone-depleted serum and treated with T4 (0.1<br>
umol/L) for 15 minutes to 6 hours. Cells were harvested and nuclear fractions prepared as<br>
described previously. Nucleoproteins, separated by gel electrophoresis, were<br>
immunoblotted with antibody to phosphorylated MAPK (pERKl and pERK2, 44 and 42<br>
kDa, respectively), followed by a second antibody linked to a luminescence-detection<br>
system. A (3-actin immunoblot of nuclear tractions serves as a control for gel loading in<br>
each part of this figure. Each immunoblot is representative of 3 experiments. A, T4 causes<br>
increased phosphoiylation and nuclear translocation of ERKl/2 in ECV304 cells. The effect<br>
is maximal in 30 minutes, although the effect remains for &gt;6 hours. B, ECV304 cells were<br>
treated with the ERKl/2 activation inhibitor PD 98059 (PD; 30 umol/L) or the PKC<br>
inhibitor CGP41251 (CGP; 100 nmol/L) for 30 minutes, after which 10 "7 M T4 was added<br>
for 15 minutes to cell samples as shown. Nuclei were harvested, and this representative<br>
experiment shows increased phosphorylation (activation) of ERKl/2 by T4 (lane 4), which<br>
is blocked by both inhibitors (lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that PKC activity is a requisite for<br>
MAPK activation by T4 in endothelial cells. C, ECV304 cells were treated with either T4<br>
(10 "7 mol/L), FGF2 (10 ng/mL), or both agents for 15 minutes. The figure shows pERKl/2<br>
accumulation in nuclei with either hormone or growth factor treatment and enhanced<br>
nuclear pERKl/2 accumulation with both agents together.<br>
Figure 7. T4 increases accumulation ofFGF2 cDNA in ECV304 endothelial<br>
cells. Cells were treated for 6 to 48 hours with T4 (10 "7 moVL) and FGF2 and GAPDH<br>
cDNAs isolated from each cell aliquot. The levels ofFGF2 cDNA, shown in the top blot,<br>
were corrected for variations in GAPDH cDNA content, shown in the bottom blot, and the<br>
corrected levels ofFGF2 are illustrated below in the graph (mean ±SE of mean; n = 2<br>
experiments). There was increased abundance of FGF2 transcript in RNA extracted from<br>
cells treated with T4 at all time points. *P

fibroblast cells exposed to T4 and control, according to the 3D Wound Healing Assay<br>
described herein.<br>
Figure 10. T4 Dose-Dependently Increases Wound Healing, Day 3. As<br>
indicated by the graph, T4 increases wound healing (measured by outmigrating cells) in a<br>
dose-dependent manner between concentrations of 0.1 uM and LOuM. This same increase<br>
is not seen in concentrations of T4 between l.OuM and 3.0uM.<br>
Figure 11. Effect of unlabeled T4 and T3 on I"12S-T4 binding to purified integrin.<br>
Unlabeled T4 (lO^M to 10"nM) or T3 (lO-4M to 10~8M) were added to purified ctVpS<br>
integrin (2ug/sample) and allowed to incubate for 30 min. at room temperature. Two<br>
microcuries of 1-125 labeled T« was added to each sample. The samples were incubated for<br>
20 min. at room temperature, mixed with loading dye, and run on a 5% Native gel for 24<br>
hrs. at 4°C at 45mA. Following electrophoresis, the gels were wrapped in plastic wrap and<br>
exposed to film. W25-T4 binding to purified aVp3 is unaffected by unlabeled T4 in the<br>
range of 10" M to 10" M, but is competed out in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled X*<br>
at a concentration of 10"6M. Hot T4 binding to the integrin is almost completely displaced<br>
by lO^M unlabeled T4. TS is less effective at competing out T4 binding to aVß3, reducing<br>
the signal by 11%, 16%, and 28% at 10~6M, 10'5M, and lO^M T3, respectively.<br>
Figure 12. Tetrac and an RGD containing peptide, but not an RGE containing<br>
peptide compete out T4 binding to purified aVp3. A) Tetrac addition to purified aVp3<br>
reduces l~ns-labeled Tt binding to the integrin in a dose dependent manner. 10"8M tetrac is<br>
ineffective at compering out hot T4 binding to the integrin. The association of T4 and oVp3<br>
was reduced by 38% in the presence of 10"7M tetrac and by 90% with 10"5M tetrac.<br>
Addition of an RGD peptide at 10"5M competes out T4 binding to ccV(33. Application of 10"<br>
5M and 10"*M RGE peptide, as a control for the RGD peptide, was unable to diminish hot<br>
T4 binding to purified uVp3. B) Graphical representation of the tetrac and RGD data from<br>
panel A. Data points are shown as the mean ± S.D. for 3 independent experiments.<br>
Figure 13. Effects of the monoclonal antibody LM609 on T4 binding to aVp3.<br>
A) LM609 was added to aVp3 at the indicated concentrations. One (ig of LM609 per<br>
sample reduces labeled T4 binding to the integrin by 52%. Maximal inhibition of T4<br>
binding to the integrin is reached when concentrations of LM609 are 2ug per sample and is<br>
maintained with antibody concentrations as high as 8ug. As a control for antibody<br>
specificity, lOug/sample Cox-2 mAB and 1 Dug/sample mouse IgG were added to aVp3<br>
prior to incubation with T4. B) Graphical representation of data from panel A. Data points<br>
are shown as the mean ± S.D. for 3 independent experiments.<br>
Figure 14. Effect of RGD, RGE, tetrac, and the mAB LM609 on T4-induced<br>
MAPK activation. A) CV-1 cells (50-70% confluency) were treated for 30 rain, with 10"7<br>
M T4 (10~7 M total concentration, 10"10M free concentration. Selected samples were treated<br>
for 16 hrs with the indicated concentrations of either an RGD containing peptide, an RGE<br>
containing peptide, tetrac, or LM609 prior to the addition of T4. Nuclear proteins ere<br>
separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MAPK (pERKl/2)<br>
antibody. Nuclear accumulation of pERKl/2 is diminished in samples treated with 10"6 M<br>
RGD peptide or higher, but not significantly altered in samples treated with 10"4 M RGE.<br>
pERKl/2 accumulation is decreased 76% in CVI cells treated with lO M tetrac, while 10"<br>
5M and higher concentrations of tetrac reduce nuclear accumulation of pERKl/2 to levels<br>
similar to the untreated control samples. The monoclonal antibody to aVp3 LM609<br>
decrease accumulation of activated MAPK in the nucleus when it is applied to CVI cultures<br>
a concentration of lu.g/ml. B) Graphical representation of the data for RGD, RGE, and<br>
tetrac shown in panel A. Data points represent the mean ± S.D. for 3 separate experiments.<br>

CV1 cells were transfected with siRNA (100 nM final concentration) to aV, P3, or aV and<br>
(33 together. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with 10"7M T4. A) RT-PCR<br>
was performed from RNA isolated from each transfection group to verify the specificity and<br>
functionality of each siRNA. B) Nuclear proteins from each transfection were isolated and<br>
subjected to SDS-PAGE.<br>

Angiogenesis in the CAM Model. A) Samples were exposed to PBS, T4 (0.1 uM), or T4<br>
plus 1 Omg/ml LM609 for 3 days. Angiogenesis stimulated by T4 is substantially inhibited<br>
by the addition of the aB3 monoclonal antibody LM609. B) Tabulation of the mean ±<br>
SEM of new branches formed from existing blood vessels during the experimental period.<br>
Data was drawn from 3 separate experiments, each containing 9 samples in each treatment<br>
group. C, D) Angiogenesis stimulated by T4 or FGF2 is also inhibited by the addition of<br>
the aVp3 monoclonal antibody LM609 or XT 199.<br>
Figure 17. Polymer Compositions of Thyroid Hormone Analogs - Polymer<br>
Conjugation Through an Ester Linkage Using Polyvinyl Alcohol. In this preparation<br>
commercially available polyvinyl alcohol (or related co-polymers) can be esterified by<br>
treatment with the acid chloride of thyroid hormone analogs, namely the acid chloride form.<br>
The hydrochloride salt is neutralized by the addition of triethylamine to afford triethylamine<br>
hydrochloride which can be washed away with water upon precipitation of the thyroid<br>
hormone ester polymer form for different analogs. The ester linkage to the polymer may<br>
undergo hydrolysis in vivo to release the active pro-angiogenesis thyroid hormone analog.<br>
Figure 18. Polymer Compositions of Thyroid Hormone Analogs - Polymer<br>
Conjugation Through an Anhydride Linkage Using Acrylic Acid Ethylene Copolymer.<br>
This is similar to the previous polymer covalent conjugation however this time it<br>
is through an anhydride linkage that is derived from reaction of an acrylic acid co-polymer.<br>
This anhydride linkage is also susceptible to hydrolysis in vivo to release thyroid hormone<br>
analog. Neutralization of the hydrochloric acid is accomplished by treatment with<br>
triethylamine and subsequent washing of the precipitated polyanhydride polymer with water<br>
removes the triethylamine hydrochloride byproduct. This reaction will lead to the formation<br>
of Thyroid hormone analog acrylic acid co-polymer + triethylamine. Upon in vivo<br>
hydrolysis, the thyroid hormone analog will be released over time that can be controlled<br>
plus acrylic acid ethylene Co-polymer.<br>
Figure 19. Polymer Compositions of Thyroid Hormone Analogs - Entrapment<br>
in a Polylactic Acid Polymer. Polylactic acid polyester polymers (PLA) undergo<br>
hydrolysis //; vivo to the lactic acid monomer and this has been exploited as a vehicle for<br>
drug delivery systems in humans. Unlike the prior two covalent methods where the thyroid<br>
hormone analog is linked by a chemical bond to the polymer, this would be a non-covalent<br>
method that would encapsulate the thyroid hormone analog into PLA polymer beads. This<br>
reaction will lead to the formation of Thyroid hormone analog containing PLA beads in<br>
water. Filter and washing will result in the formation of thyroid hormone analog containing<br>
PLA beads, which upon in vivo hydrolysis will lead to the generation of controlled levels of<br>
thyroid hormone plus lactic acid.<br>

was reached when the concentration of LM609 was 2 |J.g/ml and was maintained with<br>
antibody concentrations as high as 8 u.g/ml. SC7312 reduced T4 binding to ocVp3 by 46%<br>

DETAILED DESCRDPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The features and other details of the invention will now be more particularly<br>
described with references to the accompanying drawings, and as pointed out by the claims.<br>
For convenience, certain terms used in the specification, examples and claims are collected<br>
here. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same<br>
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention<br>
pertains.<br>
As used herein, the term "angiogenic agent" includes any compound or substance<br>
that promotes or encourages angiogenesis, whether alone or in combination with another<br>
substance. Examples include, but are not limited to, T3, T4, T3 or T4-agarose, polymeric<br>
analogs of T3, T4, 3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid<br>
(GC-1), or DiTPA. In contrast, the terms "anti-angiogenesis agent" or anti-angiogenic<br>
agent" refer to any compound or substance that inhibits or discourages angiogenesis,<br>
whether alone or in combination with another substance. Examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, TETRAC, TRIAC, XT 199, and mAb LM609.<br>
As used herein, the term "myocardial ischemia" is defined as an insufficient blood<br>
supply to the heart muscle caused by a decreased capacity of the heart vessels. As used<br>
herein, the term "coronary disease" is defined as diseases/disorders of cardiac function due<br>
to an imbalance between myocardial function and the capacity of coronary vessels to supply<br>
sufficient blood flow for nonnal function. Specific coronary diseases/disorders associated<br>
with coronary disease which can be treated with the compositions and methods described<br>
herein include myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, coronary aneurysm, coronary<br>
thrombosis, coronary vasospasm, coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, coronary<br>
occlusion and coronary stenosis.<br>
As used herein the term "occlusive peripheral vascular disease" (also known as<br>
peripheral arterial occlusive disorder) is a vascular disorder-involving blockage in the<br>
carotid or femoral arteries, including the iliac artery. Blockage in the femoral arteries causes<br>
pain and restricted movement. A specific disorder associated with occlusive peripheral<br>
vascular disease is diabetic foot, which affects diabetic patients, often resulting in<br>
amputation of the foot.<br>
As used herein the terms "regeneration of blood vessels," "angiogenesis,"<br>
"revascularization," and "increased collateral circulation" (or words to that effect) are<br>
considered as synonymous. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" when referring to a<br>
natural or synthetic substance means that the substance has an acceptable toxic effect in<br>
view of its much greater beneficial effect, while the related the term, "physiologically<br>
acceptable," means the substance has relatively low toxicity. The term, "co-administered"<br>
means two or more drugs are given to a patient at approximately the same time or in close<br>
sequence so that their effects run approximately concurrently or substantially overlap. This<br>
term includes sequential as well as simultaneous drug administration.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives, which salts are derived from a<br>
variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of<br>
example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetra-alkyl ammonium,<br>
and the like; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or<br>
inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate,<br>
oxalate and the like can be used as the pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term also<br>
includes both acid and base addition salts.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt" refers to those salts which retain the<br>
biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases, which are not biologically or<br>
otherwise undesirable, and which are formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic<br>
acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, pymvic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic<br>
acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Particularly<br>
preferred salts of compounds of the invention are the monochloride salts and the dichloride<br>
salts.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt" refers to those salts which retain<br>
the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or<br>
otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an<br>
organic base to the free acid. Salts derived rrom inorganic bases include, but are not limited<br>
to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, aluminum salts<br>
and the like. Preferred inorganic salts are the ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and<br>

"Ureido" refers to a radical of the formula -N(H)--C(O)~NH2.<br>
It is understood from the above definitions and examples that for radicals containing<br>
a substituted alkyl group any substitution thereon can occur on any carbon of the alkyl<br>
group. The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may<br>
have asymmetric carbon atoms in their structure. The compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts may therefore exist as single enantiomers,<br>
diastereoisomers, racemates, and mixtures of enantiomers and diastereomers. All such<br>
single enantiomers, diastereoisomers, racemates and mixtures thereof are intended to be<br>
within the scope of this invention. Absolute configuration of certain carbon atoms within<br>
the compounds, if known, are indicated by the appropriate absolute descriptor R or S.<br>
Separate enantiomers can be prepared through the use of optically active starting<br>
materials and/or intermediates or through the use of conventional resolution techniques,<br>
e.g., enzymatic resolution or chiral HPLC.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "growth factors" or "neurogenesis factors" refers to<br>
proteins, peptides or other molecules having a growth, proliferative, differentiative, or<br>
trophic effect on cells of the CMS or PNS. Such factors may be used for inducing<br>
proliferation or differentiation and can include, for example, any trophic factor that allows<br>
cells of the CNS or PNS to proliferate, including any molecule which binds to a receptor on<br>
the surface ol the cell to exert a trophic, or growth-inducing effect on the cell. Preferred<br>
factors include, but are not limited to, nerve growth factor ("NGF"), epidermal growth<br>
factor ("EOF"), platelet-derived growth factor ("PDGF"), insulin-like growth factor<br>
("IGF"), acidic fibroblast growth fator ("aFGF" or "FGF-I"), basic fibroblast growth factor<br>
("bFGF" or "FGF-2"), and transforming growth factor-alpha and -beta ("TGF-a" and<br>
"TGF-P").<br>
"Subject" includes living organisms such as humans, monkeys, cows, sheep, horses,<br>
pigs, cattle, goats, dogs, cats, mice, rats, cultured cells therefrom, and transgenic species<br>
thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. Administration of the<br>
compositions of the present invention to a subject to be treated can be carried out using<br>
known procedures, at dosages and for periods of time effective to treat the condition in the<br>
subject. An effective amount of the therapeutic compound necessary to achieve a<br>
therapeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the age, sex, and weight of the<br>
subject, and the ability of the therapeutic compound to treat the foreign agents in the<br>
subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.<br>
For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be<br>
proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
"Administering" includes routes of administration which allow the compositions of<br>
the invention to perform their intended function, e.g., promoting angiogenesis. A variety of<br>
routes of administration are possible including, but not necessarily limited to parenteral<br>
(e.g., intravenous, intra-arterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous injection), oral (e.g., dietary),<br>
topical, nasal, rectal, or via slow releasing microcarriers depending on the disease or<br>
condition to be treated. Oral, parenteral and intravenous administration are preferred modes<br>
of administration. Formulation of the compound to be administered will vary according to<br>
the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, gels, aerosols, capsule). An<br>
appropriate composition comprising the compound to be administered can be prepared in a<br>
physiologically acceptable vehicle or earner and optional adjuvants and preservatives. For<br>
solutions or emulsions, suitable carriers include, for example, aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous<br>
solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media, sterile water,<br>
creams, ointments, lotions, oils, pastes and solid carriers. Parenteral vehicles can include<br>
sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated<br>
Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles can include various additives, preservatives, or<br>
fluid, nutnent or electrolyte replenishes (See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Science, 16th Edition, Mack, Ed. (1980)).<br>
"Effective amount" includes those amounts of pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic<br>
compounds which allow it to perform its intended function, e.g., promoting or inhibiting<br>
angiogenesis in angiogenesis-related disorders as described herein. The effective amount<br>
will depend upon a number of factors, including biological activity, age, body weight, sex,<br>
general health, severity of the condition to be treated, as well as appropriate<br>
pharmacokinetic properties. For example, dosages of the active substance may be from<br>
about O.Olmg/kg/day to about 500mg/kg/day, advantageously from about O.lmg/kg/day to<br>
about lOOmg/kg/day. A therapeutically effective amount of the active substance can be<br>
administered by an appropriate route in a single dose or multiple doses. Further, the<br>
dosages of the active substance can be proportionally increased or decreased as indicated by<br>
the exigencies of the therapeutic or prophylactic situation.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion<br>
media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying<br>
agents, and the like which are compatible with the activity of the compound and are<br>
physiologically acceptable to the subject. An example of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier is buffered normal saline (0.15M Nad). The use of such media and agents for<br>
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional media or agent is incompatible with the therapeutic compound, use thereof in<br>
the compositions suitable for pharmaceutical administration is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
"Additional ingredients" include, but are not limited to, one or more of the<br>
following: excipients; surface active agents; dispersing agents; inert diluents; granulating<br>

gelatin; aqueous vehicles and solvents; oily vehicles and solvents; suspending agents;<br>
dispersing or wetting agents; emulsifying; agents, demulcents; buffers; salts; thickening<br>
agents; fillers; emulsifying agents; antioxidants; antibiotics; antifungal agents; stabilizing<br>
agents; and pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials. Other<br>
"additional ingredients" which may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention are known in the art and described, e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
Compositions<br>
Disclosed herein are angiogenic agents comprising thyroid hormones, analogs<br>
thereof, and polymer conjugations of the hormones and their analogs. The disclosed<br>
compositions can be used for promoting angiogenesis to treat disorders wherein<br>
angiogenesis is beneficial. Additionally, the inhibition of these thyroid hormones, analogs<br>
and polymer conjugations can be used to inhibit angiogenesis to treat disorders associated<br>
with such undesired angiogenesis. As used herein, the term "angiogenic agent" includes<br>
any compound or substance that promotes or encourages angiogenesis, whether alone or in<br>
combination with another substance. Examples include, but are not limited to, T3, T4, T3<br>
or T4-agarose, polymeric analogs of T3, T4, 3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroy-3'-<br>
isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid (GC-1), or DITPA.<br>
Polymer conjugations are used to improve drug viability. While many old and new<br>
therapeutics are well-tolerated, many compounds need advanced drug discovery<br>
technologies to decrease toxicity, increase circulatory time, or modify biodistribution. One<br>
strategy for improving drug viability is the utilization of water-soluble polymers. Various<br>
water-soluble polymers have been shown to modify biodistribution, improve the mode of<br>
cellular uptake, change the permeability through physiological barriers, and modify the rate<br>
of clearance through the body. To achieve either a targeting or sustained-release effect,<br>
water-soluble polymers have been synthesized that contain drug moieties as terminal<br>
groups, as part of the backbone, or as pendent groups on the polymer chain.<br>
Representative compositions of the present invention include thyroid hormone or<br>
analogs thereof conjugated to polymers. Conjugation with polymers can be either through<br>
covalent or non-covalent linkages. In preferred embodiments, the polymer conjugation can<br>
occur through an ester linkage or an anhydride linkage. An example of a polymer<br>
conjugation through an ester linkage using poly vinyl alcohol is shown in Figure 17. In this<br>
preparation commercially available polyvinyl alcohol (or related co-polymers) can be<br>
esterified by treatment with the acid chloride of thyroid hormone analogs, including the acid<br>
chloride form. The hydrochloride salt is neutralized by the addition of triethylamine to<br>
afford triethylamine hydrochloride which can be washed away with water upon<br>
precipitation of the thyroid hormone ester polymer form for different analogs. The ester<br>
linkage to the polymer may undergo hydrolysis in vivo to release the active proangiogenesis<br>
thyroid hormone analog.<br>
An example of a polymer conjugation through an anhydride linkage using acrylic<br>
acid ethylene co-polymer is shown in Figure 18. This is similar to the previous polymer<br>
covalent conjugation, however, this time it is through an anhydride linkage that is derived<br>
from reaction of an acrylic acid co-polymer. This anhydride linkage is also susceptible to<br>
hydrolysis in vivo to release thyroid hormone analog. Neutralization of the hydrochloric<br>
acid is accomplished by treatment with triethylamine and subsequent washing of the<br>
precipitated polyanhydride polymer with water removes the triethylamine hydrochloride<br>
byproduct. This reaction will lead to the formation of Thyroid hormone analog acrylic acid<br>
co-polymer + triethylamine. Upon in vivo hydrolysis, the thyroid hormone analog will he<br>
released over time that can be controlled plus acrylic acid ethylene Co-polymer.<br>
Another representative polymer conjugation includes thyroid hormone or its analogs<br>
conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Attachment of PEG to various drugs, proteins<br>
and liposomes has been shown to improve residence time and decrease toxicity. PEG can<br>
be coupled to active agents through the hydroxyl groups at the ends of the chains and via<br>
other chemical methods. Peg itself, however, is limited to two active agents per molecule.<br>
In a different approach, copolymers of PEG and amino acids were explored as novel<br>
biomaterials which would retain the biocompatibility properties of PEG, but which would<br>
have the added advantage of numerous attachment points per molecule and which could be<br>
synthetically designed to suit a variety of applications.<br>
Another representative polymer conjugation includes thyroid hormone or its analogs<br>
in non-covalent conjugation with polymers. This is shown in detail in Figure 19. A<br>
preferred non-covalent conjugation is entrapment of thyroid hormone or analogs thereof in a<br>
polylactic acid polymer. Polylactic acid polyester polymers (PLA) undergo hydrolysis in<br>
vivo to the lactic acid monomer and this has been exploited as a vehicle for drug delivery<br>
systems in humans. Unlike the prior two covalent methods where the thyroid hormone<br>
analog is linked by a chemical bond to the polymer, this would be a non-covalent method<br>
that would encapsulate the thyroid hormone analog into PLA polymer beads. This reaction<br>
will lead to the formation of Thyroid hormone analog containing PLA beads in water. Filter<br>
and washing will result in the formation of thyroid hormone analog containing PLA beads,<br>
which upon in vivo hydrolysis hydrolysis will lead to the generation of controlled levels of<br>
thyroid hormone plus lactic acid.<br>
Still further, compositions of the present invention include thyroid hormone analogs<br>
conjugated to retinols (e.g., retinoic acid (i.e., Vitamin A), which bind to the thyroid<br>
hormone binding protein transthyretin ("TTR") and retinoic binding protein ("RBP").<br>
Thyroid hormone analogs can also be conjugated with halogenated srilbesterols, alone or in<br>
combination with retinoic acid, for use in detecting and suppressing amyloid plaque. These<br>
analogs combine the advantageous properties of T4-TTR, namely, their rapid uptake and<br>
prolonged retention in brain and amyloids, with the properties of halogen substiruents,<br>
including certain useful halogen isotopes for PET imaging including fluorine-18, iodine-<br>
123, iodine-124, iodine-131, broniine-75, bromine-76, bromine-77 and bromine-82.<br>
Furthermore, nanotechnology can be used for the creation of useful materials and<br>
structures sized at the nanometer scale. The main drawback with biologically active<br>
substances is fragility. Nanoscale materials can be combined with such biologically active<br>
substances to dramatically improve the durability of the substance, create localized high<br>
concentrations of the substance and reduce costs by minimizing losses. Therefore,<br>
additional polymeric conjugations include nano-particle formulations of thyroid hormones<br>
and analogs thereof. In such an embodiment, nano-polymers and nano-particles can be<br>
used as a marix for local delivery of thyrid hormone and its analogs. This will aid in time<br>
controlled delivery into the cellular and tissue target.<br>
Compositions of the present invention include both thyroid hormone, analogs, and<br>
derivatives either alone or in covalent or non-covalent conjugation with polymers.<br>
Examples of representative analogs and derivatives are shown in Figure 20, Tables A-D.<br>
Table A shows T2, T3, T4, and bromo-derivatives. Table B shows alanyl side chain<br>
modifications. Table C shows hydroxy groups, diphenyl ester linkages, and Dconfigurations.<br>
Table D shows tyrosine analogs.<br>
The terms "anti-angiogenesis agent" or anti-angiogenic agent" refer to any<br>
compound or substance that inhibits or discourages angiogenesis, whether alone or in<br>
combination with another substance. Examples include, but are not limited to, TETRAC,<br>
TRIAC, XT 199, and mAb LM609.<br>
The Role of Thyroid Hormone, Analogs, and Polymeric Conjugations in Promoting<br>
Angiogenesis<br>
The pro-angiogenic effect of thyroid hormone analogs or polymeric forms depends<br>
upon a non-genomic initiation, as tested by the susceptibility of the hormonal effect to<br>
reduction by pharmacological inhibitors of the MAPK signal transduction pathway. Such<br>
results indicates that another consequence of activation of MAPK by thyroid hormone is<br>
new blood vessel growth. The latter is initiated nongenomically, but of course, requires a<br>
consequent complex gene transcription program. The ambient concentrations of thyroid<br>
hormone are relatively stable. The CAM model, at the time we tested it, was thyroprival<br>
and thus may be regarded as a system, which does not reproduce the intact organism.<br>
The availability of a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay for angiogenesis<br>
has provided a model in which to quantitate angiogenesis and to study possible mechanisms<br>
involved in the induction by thyroid hormone of new blood vessel growth. The present<br>
application discloses a pro-angiogenic effect of T^ that approximates that in the CAM model<br>
of FGF2 and that can enhance the action of suboptimal doses of FGF2. It is further<br>
disclosed that the pro-angiogenic effect of the hormone is initiated at the plasma membrane<br>
and is dependent upon activation by T4 of the MAPK signal transduction pathway. As<br>
provided above, methods for treatment of occlusive peripheral vascular disease and<br>
coronary diseases, in particular, the occlusion of coronary vessels, and disorders associated<br>
with the occlusion of the peripheral vasculature and/or coronary blood vessels are disclosed.<br>
Also disclosed are compositions and methods for promoting angiogenesis and/or recruiting<br>
collateral blood vessels in a patient in need thereof. The compositions include an effective<br>
amount of Thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives. The methods<br>
involve the co-administration of an effective amount of thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric<br>
forms, and derivatives in low, daily dosages for a week or more with other standard proangiogenesis<br>
growth factors, vasodilators, anticoagulants, thrombolytics or other vascularrelated<br>
therapies.<br>
The CAM assay has been used to validate angiogenic activity of a variety of growth<br>
factors and compounds believed to promote angiogenesis. For example, T4 in physiological<br>
concentrations was shown to be pro-angiogenic in this in vitro model and on a molar basis<br>
to have the activity of FGF2. The presence of PTU did not reduce the effect of T4,<br>
indicating that de-iodination of T,t to generate TS was not a prerequisite in this model. A<br>
summary of the pro-angiogenesis effects of various thyroid hormone analogs is listed in<br>
label 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The appearance of new blood vessel growth in this model requires several days,<br>
indicating that the effect of thyroid hormone was wholly dependent upon the interaction of<br>
the nuclear receptor for thyroid hormone (TR) with the hormone. Actions of<br>
iodothyronines that require intranuclear complexing of TR with its natural ligand, TI, are by<br>
definition, genomic, and culminate in gene expression. On the other hand, the preferential<br>
response of this model system to T4-rather than TS, the natural ligand of TR-raised the<br>
possibility that angiogenesis might be initiated nongenomically at the plasma membrane by<br>
T4 and culminate in effects that require gene transcription. Non-genomic actions of T4 have<br>
been widely described, are usually initiated at the plasma membrane and may be mediated<br>
by signal transduction pathways. They do not require intranuclear ligand of iodothyronine<br>
and TR, but may interface with or modulate gene transcription. Non-genomic actions of<br>
steroids have also been well described and are known to interface with genomic actions of<br>
steroids or of other compounds, Experiments carried out with T4 and tetrac or with agarose-<br>
T4 indicated that the pro-angtogenic effect of 1$ indeed very likely was initiated at the<br>
plasma membrane. Tetrac blocks membrane-initiated effects of T/i, but does not, itself,<br>
activate signal transduction. Thus, it is a probe for non-genomic actions of thyroid<br>
hormone. Agarose-14 is thought not to gain entry to the cell interior and has been used to<br>
examine models for possible cell surface-initiated actions of the hormone. Investigations of<br>
the pro-angiogenic effects of thyroid hormone in the chick chorioallantoic membrane<br>
("CAM") model demonstrate that generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels<br>
was promoted two- to three-fold by either L-thyroxine (T4) or 3,5,3'-triiodo-L~thyronine<br>
(T^) at 10~7- 10~9 M. More interestingly, T4-agarose, a thyroid hormone analog that does<br>
not cross the cell membrane, produced a potent pro-angiogenesis effect comparable to that<br>
obtained with T-j or IV<br>
In part, this invention provides compositions and methods for promoting<br>
angiogenesis in a subject in need thereof. Conditions amenable to treatment by promoting<br>
angiogenesis include, for example, occlusive peripheral vascular disease and coronary<br>
diseases, in particular, the occlusion of coronary vessels, and disorders associated with the<br>
occlusion of the peripheral vasculature and/or coronary blood vessels, erectile dysfunction,<br>
stroke, and wounds. Also disclosed are compositions and methods for promoting<br>
angiogenesis and/or recruiting collateral blood vessels in a patient in need thereof. The<br>
compositions include an effective amount of polymeric forms of thyroid hormone analogs<br>
and derivatives and an effective amount of an adenosine and/or nitric oxide donor. The<br>
compositions can be in the form of a sterile, injectable, pharmaceutical formulation that<br>
includes an angiogenically effective amount of thyroid hormone-like substance and<br>
adenosine derivatives in a physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
optionally with one or more excipients.<br>
Myocardial Infarction<br>
A major reason for heart failure following acute myocardial infarction is an<br>
inadequate response of new blood vessel formation, i.e., angiogenesis. Thyroid hormone<br>
and its analogs are beneficial in heart failure and stimulate coronary angiogenesis. The<br>
methods of the invention include, in part, delivering a single treatment of a thyroid hormone<br>
analog at the time of infarction either by direct injection into the myocardium, or by<br>
simulation of coronary injection by intermittent aortic ligation to produce transient<br>
isovolumic contractions to achieve angiogenesis and/or ventricular remodeling.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect the invention features methods for treating occlusive<br>
vascular disease, coronary disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia, stroke, and/or<br>
peripheral artery vascular disorders by promoting angiogenesis by administering to a subject<br>
in need thereof an amount of a polymeric form of thyroid hormone, or an analog thereof,<br>
effective for promoting angiogenesis.<br>
Examples of polymeric forms of thyroid hormone analogs are also provided herein<br>
and can include triiodothyronine (T3), levothyroxine (T4), (GC-1), or 3,5-<br>
diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) conjugated to polyvin)'! alcohol, acrylic acid ethylene<br>
co-polymer, polylactic acid, or agarose.<br>
The methods also involve the co-administration of an effective amount of thyroid<br>
hormone-like substance and an effective amount of an adenosine and/or NO donor in low,<br>
daily dosages for a week or more. One or both components can be delivered locally via<br>
catheter. Thyroid hormone analogs, and derivatives in vivo can be delivered to capillary<br>
beds surrounding ischemic tissue by incorporation of the compounds in an appropriately<br>
sized liposome or microparticle. Thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms and derivatives<br>
can be targeted to ischemic tissue by covalent linkage with a suitable antibody.<br>
The method may be used as a treatment to restore cardiac function after a<br>
myocardial infarction. The method may also be used to improve blood flow in patients with<br>
coronary artery disease suffering from myocardial ischemia or inadequate blood flow to<br>
areas other than the heart including, for example, occlusive peripheral vascular disease (also<br>
known as peripheral arterial occlusive disease), or erectile dysfunction.<br>
Wound Healing<br>
Wound angiogenesis is an important part of the proliferative phase of healing-<br>
Healing of any skin wound other than the most superficial cannot occur without<br>
angiogenesis. Not only does any damaged vasculature need to be repaired, but the increased<br>
local cell activity necessary for healing requires an increased supply of nutrients from the<br>
bloodstream. Moreover, the endothelial cells which form the lining of the blood vessels are<br>
important in themselves as organizers and regulators of healing.<br>
Thus, angiogenesis provides a new microcirculation to support the healing wound.<br>
The new blood vessels become clinically visible within the wound space by four days after<br>
injury. Vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells all proliferate in<br>
coordination to support wound granulation. Simultaneously, re-epithelialization occurs to<br>
reestablish the epithelial cover. Epithelial cells from the wound margin or from deep hair<br>
follicles migrate across the wound and establish themselves over the granulation tissue and<br>
provisional matrix. Growth factors such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) mediate this<br>
process. Several models (sliding versus rolling cells) of epithelialization exist.<br>
As thyroid hormones regulate metabolic rate, when the metabolism slows down due<br>
to hypothyroidism, wound healing also slows down. The role of topically applied thyroid<br>
hormone analogs or polymeric forms in wound healing therefore represents a novel strategy<br>
to accelerate wound healing in diabetics and in non-diabetics with impaired wound healing<br>
abilities. Topical adminstration can be in the form of attachment to a band-aid.<br>
Additonally, nano-polymers and nano-particles can be used as a marix for local delivery of<br>
thyrid hormone and its analogs. This will aid in time-controlled delivery into the cellular<br>
and tissue target.<br>
Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention features methods for treating<br>
wounds by promoting angiogenesis by administering to a subject in need thereof an amount<br>
of a polymeric form of thyroid hormone, or an analog thereof, effective for promoting<br>
angiogenesis. For details, see Examples 9A and 9B.<br>
The Role of Thyroid Hormone, Analogs, and Polymeric Conjugations in Combination with<br>
Nerve Growth Factors in Inducing and Maintaining Neuronal Cells<br>
Contrary to traditional understanding of neural induction, the present invention is<br>
partly based on the unexpected finding that mechanisms that initiate and maintain<br>
angiogenesis are effective promoters and sustainers of neurogenesis. These methods and<br>
compositions are useful, for example, for the treatment of motor neuron injury and<br>
neuropathy in trauma, injury and neuronal disorders. This invention discloses the use of<br>
various pro-angiogenesis strategies alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or<br>
other neurogenesis factors. Pro-angiogenesis factors include polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs as illustrated herein. The polymeric thyroid hormone analogs and its polymeric<br>
conjugates alone or in combination with other pro-angiogenesis growth factors known in the<br>
ait and with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors can be combined for optimal<br>
neurogenesis.<br>
Disclosed are therapeutic treatment methods, compositions and devices for<br>
maintaining neural pathways in a mammal, including enhancing survival of neurons at risk<br>
of dying, inducing cellular repair of damaged neurons and neural pathways, and stimulating<br>
neurons to maintain their differentiated phenotype. Additionally, a composition containing<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs, and combinations thereof, in the presence of antioxidants<br>
and/or anti-inflammatory agents demonstrate neuronal regeneration and protection.<br>
The present invention also provides thyroid hormones, analogs, and polymeric<br>
conjugations, alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors, to enhance survival of neurons and maintain neural pathways. As described herein,<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors are capable of enhancing survival of neurons, stimulating<br>
neuronal CAM expression, maintaining the phenotypic expression of differentiated neurons,<br>
inducing the redifferentiation of transformed cells of neural origin, and stimulating axonal<br>
growth over breaks in neural processes, particularly large gaps in axons. Morphogens also<br>
protect against tissue destruction associated with immunologically-related nerve tissue<br>
damage. Finally, polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors may be used as part of a method for monitoring<br>
the viability of nerve tissue in a mammal.<br>
The present invention also provides effects of polymeric thyroid hormones on<br>
synapse formation between cultured rat cortical neurons, using a system to estimate<br>
functional synapse formation in vitro. Exposure to 10-9 M polymeric thyroid hormones,<br>
3,5,3'-triiodothyronine or thyroxine, caused an increase in the frequency of spontaneous<br>
synchronous oscillatory changes in intracellular calcium concentration, which correlated<br>
with the number of synapses formed. The detection of synaptic vesicle-associated protein<br>
synapsin I by immunocytochemical and immunoblot analysis also confirmed that exposure<br>
to thyroxine facilitated synapse formation. The presence of amiodarone, an inhibitor of 5'-<br>
deiodinase, or amitrole, a herbicide, inhibited the synapse formation in the presence of<br>
thyroxine. Thus, the present invention also provides a useful in vitro assay system for<br>
screening of miscellaneous chemicals that might interfere with synapse formation in the<br>
developing CNS by disrupting the polymeric thyroid system.<br>
As a genera] matter, methods of the present invention maybe applied to the<br>
treatment of any mammalian subject at risk of or afflicted with a neural tissue insult or<br>
neuropathy. The invention is suitable for the treatment of any primate, preferably a higher<br>
primate such as a human. In addition, however, the invention may be employed in the<br>
treatment of domesticated mammals which are maintained as human companions (e.g.,<br>
dogs, cats, horses), which have significant commercial value (e.g., goats, pigs, sheep, cattle,<br>
sporting or draft animals), which have significant scientific value (e.g., captive or free<br>
specimens of endangered species, or inbred or engineered animal strains), or which<br>
otherwise have value.<br>
The polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors described herein enhance cell survival, particularly of<br>
neuronal cells at risk of dying. For example, fully differentiated neurons are non-mitotic and<br>
die in vitro when cultured under standard mammalian cell culture conditions, using a<br>
chemically defined or low serum medium known in the art. See, for example, Charness, J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 26: 3164-3169 (1986) and Freese, et al., Brain Res. 521: 254-264 (1990).<br>
However, if a primary culture of non-mitotic neuronal cells is treated with polymeric<br>
thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis<br>
factors, the survival of these cells is enhanced significantly. For example, a primary culture<br>
of striatal basal ganglia isolated from the substantia nigra of adult rat brain was prepared<br>
using standard procedures, e.g., by dissociation by trrturation with pasteur pipette of<br>
substantia nigra tissue, using standard tissue culturing protocols, and grown in a low serum<br>
medium, e.g., containing 50% DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), 50% F-12<br>
medium, heat inactivated horse serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 4 g/1<br>
glucose. Under standard culture conditions, these cells are undergoing significant cell death<br>
by three weeks when cultured in a serum-free medium. Cell death is evidenced<br>
morphologically by the inability of cells to remain adherent and by changes in their<br>
ultrasrructural characteristics, e.g., by chromatin clumping and organelle disintegration.<br>
Specifically, cells remained adherent and continued to maintain the morphology of viable<br>
differentiated neurons. In the absence of thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factor or other neurogenesis factors treatment, the majority of the cultured cells<br>
dissociated and underwent cell necrosis.<br>
Dysfunctions in the basal ganglia of the substantia nigra are associated with<br>
Huntington's chorea and parkinsoiiism in vivo. The ability of the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors defined herein to enhance neuron survival indicates that these polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors will be useful as part of a therapy to enhance survival of neuronal cells at risk of<br>
dying in vivo due, for example, to a neuropathy or chemical or mechanical trauma. The<br>
present invention further provides that these polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors provide a useful<br>
therapeutic agent to treat neuropathies which affect the striatal basal ganglia, including<br>
Huntington's chorea and Parkinson's disease. For clinical applications, the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors may be administered or, alternatively, a polymeric thyroid hotmone analog alone or<br>
in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors-stimulating agent<br>
may be administered.<br>
The thyroid hormone compounds described herein can also be used for nerve tissue<br>
protection from chemical trauma. The ability of the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors described<br>
herein to enhance survival of neuronal cells and to induce cell aggregation and cell—cell<br>
adhesion in redifferentiated cells, indicates that the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors will be<br>
useful as therapeutic agents to maintain neural pathways by protecting the cells defining the<br>
pathway from the damage caused by chemical trauma. In particular, the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors can protect neurons, including developing neurons, from the effects of toxins known<br>
to inhibit the proliferation and migration of neurons and to interfere with cell-cell adhesion.<br>
Examples of such toxins include ethanol, one or more of the toxins present in cigarette<br>
smoke, and a variety of opiates. The toxic effects of ethanol on developing neurons induces<br>
the neurological damage manifested in fetal alcohol syndrome. The polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors also may protect neurons from the cytotoxic effects associated with excitatory amino<br>
acids such as glutamate.<br>
For example, ethanol inhibits the cell—cell adhesion effects induced in polymeric<br>
thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis<br>
factors-treated NG108-15 cells when provided to these cells at a concentration of 25-50<br>
mM. Half maximal inhibition can be achieved with 5-10 mM ethanol, the concentration of<br>
blood alcohol in an adult following ingestion of a single alcoholic beverage. Ethanol likely<br>
interferes with the homophilic binding of CAMs between cells, rather than their induction,<br>
as polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors-induced N-CAM levels are unaffected by ethanol. Moreover, the<br>
inhibitory effect is inversely proportional to polymeric thyroid analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors concentration.<br>
Accordingly, it is envisioned that administration of a polymeric thyroid analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors or polymeric thyroid<br>
analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factorsstimulating<br>
agent to neurons, particularly developing neurons, at risk of damage from<br>
exposure to toxins such as ethanol, may protect these cells from nerve tissue damage by<br>
overcoming the toxin's inhibitory effects. The polymeric thyroid analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors described herein also<br>
are useful in therapies to treat damaged neural pathways resulting from a neuropathy<br>
induced by exposure to these toxins.<br>
The in vivo activities of the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors described herein also<br>
are assessed readily in an animal model as described herein. A suitable animal, preferably<br>
exhibiting nerve tissue damage, for example, genetically or environmentally induced, is<br>
injected intracerebrally with an effective amount of a polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors in a suitable<br>
therapeutic formulation, such as phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. The polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis<br>
factors preferably is injected within the area of the affected neurons. The affected tissue is<br>
excised at a subsequent time point and the tissue evaluated morphologically and/or by<br>
evaluation of an appropriate biochemical marker (e.g., by polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors or<br>
N-CAM localization; or by measuring the dose-dependent effect on a biochemical marker<br>
for CNS neurotrophic activity or for CNS tissue damage, using for example, glial librillary<br>
acidic protein as the marker. The dosage and incubation time will vary with the animal to be<br>
tested. Suitable dosage ranges for different species may be determined by comparison with<br>
established animal models. Presented below is an exemplary protocol for a rat brain stab<br>
model.<br>
Briefly, male Long Evans rats, obtained from standard commercial sources, are<br>
anesthetized and the head area prepared for surgeiy. The calvariae is exposed using standard<br>
surgical procedures and a hole drilled toward the center of each lobe using a 0.035K wire,<br>
just piercing the calvariae. 25 ml solutions containing either polymeric thyroid analog alone<br>
or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors (e.g., OP-1, 25<br>
mg) or PBS then is provided to each of the holes by Hamilton syringe. Solutions are<br>
delivered to a depth approximately 3 mm below the surface, into the underlying cortex,<br>
corpus callosum and hippocampus. The skin then is sutured and the animal allowed to<br>
recover.<br>
Three days post surgery, rats are sacrificed by decapitation and their brains<br>
processed for sectioning. Scar tissue formation is evaluated by imrnunofluorescence staining<br>
for glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker protein for glial scarring, to qualitatively<br>
determine the degree of scar formation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies are<br>
available commercially, e.g., from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. Sections also are<br>
probed with anti-OP-1 antibodies to determine the presence of OP-1. Reduced levels of glial<br>
fibrillary acidic protein are anticipated in the tissue sections of animals treated with the<br>
polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors, evidencing the ability of polymeric thyroid analog alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors to inhibit glial scar<br>
formation and stimulate nerve regeneration.<br>
The Role of ^Thyroid Hormone, Analogs, and Polymeric Conjugations for Brain Imaging,<br>
Diagnosis, and Therapies; of Neurodegenerative Diseases<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceuticals<br>
useful for the early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neurodegenerative disease, such<br>
as, for example, Alzheimer's disease. The invention also includes novel chemical<br>
compounds having specific binding in a biological system and capable of being used for<br>
positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission (SPECT) imaging methods,<br>
and magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging methods. The ability of T4 and other thyroid<br>
hormone analogs to bind to localized ligands within the body makes it possible to utilize<br>
such compounds for m situ imaging of the ligands by PET, SPECT, MRI, and similar<br>
imaging methods. In principle, nothing need be known about the nature of the ligand, as<br>
long as binding occurs, and such binding is specific for a class of cells, organs, tissues or<br>
receptors of interest.<br>
PET imaging is accomplished with the aid of tracer compounds labeled with a<br>
positron-emitting isotope (Goodman, M. M. Clinical Positron Emission Tomography,<br>
Mosby Yearbook, 1992, K. F. Hubner et al., Chapter 14). For most biological materials,<br>
suitable isotopes are few. The carbon isotope, UC, has been used for PET, but its short halflife<br>
of 20.5 minutes limits its usefulness to compounds that can be synthesized and purified<br>
quickly, and to facilities that are proximate to a cyclotron where the precursor C11 starting<br>
material is generated. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives. N13 has a half-life of 10<br>
minutes and O15 has an even shorter half-life of 2 minutes. The emissions of both are more<br>
energetic than those of C1'. Nevertheless, PET studies have been carried out with these<br>
isotopes (Hubner, K. F., in Clinical Positron Emission Tomography, Mosby Year Book,<br>
1992, K. F. Hubner, et al., Chapter 2). A more useful isotope, 18F, has a half-life of 110<br>
minutes. This allows sufficient time for incorporation into a radio-labeled tracer, for<br>
purification and for administration into a human or animal subject. In addition, facilities<br>
more remote from a cyclotron, up to about a 200 mile radius, can make use of F18 labeled<br>
compounds. Disadvantages of 18F are the relative scarcity of fluorinated analogs that have<br>
functional equivalence to naturally-occurring biological materials, and the difficulty of<br>
designing methods of synthesis that efficiently utilize the starting material generated in the<br>
cyclotron. Such starting material can be either fluoride ion or fluorine gas. In the latter case<br>
only one fluorine atom of the bimolecular gas is actually a radionuclide, so the gas is<br>
designated F-F18. Reactions using F-F18 as starting material therefore yield products having<br>
only one half the radionuclide abundance of reactions utilizing K. F18 as starting material.<br>
On the other hand, F18 can be prepared in curie quantities as fluoride ion for incorporation<br>
into a radiophannaceutical compound in high specific activity, theoretically 1.7 Ci/nmol<br>
using carrier-free nucleophilic substitution reactions. The energy emission of F18 is 0.635<br>
MeV, resulting in a relatively short, 2.4 mm average positron range in tissue, permitting<br>
30 high resolution PET images.<br>
SPECT imaging employs isotope tracers that emit high energy photons (.gamma.-<br>
emitters). The range of useful isotopes is greater than for PET, but SPECT provides lower<br>
three-dimensional resolution. Nevertheless, SPECT is widely used to obtain clinically<br>
significant information about analog binding, localization and clearance rates. A useful<br>
isotope for SPEC"T imaging is I12' a-gamma.-emitter with a 13.3 hour half life. Compounds<br>
labeled with I " can be shipped up to about 1000 miles from the manufacturing site, or the<br>
isotope itself can be transported for on-site synthesis. Eighty-five percent of the isotope's<br>
emissions are 159 KeV photons, which is readily measured by SPECT instrumentation<br>
currently in use. The compounds of the invention can be labeled with Technetium.<br>
Technetium-99m is known to be a useful radionuclide for SPECT imaging. The T4 analogs<br>
of the invention are joined to a Tc-99ra metal cluster through a 4-6 carbon chain which can<br>
be saturated or possess a double or triple bond.<br>
Use of F18 labeled compounds in PET has been limited to a few analog compounds.<br>
Most notably, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose has been widely used in studies of glucose<br>
metabolism and localization of glucose uptake associated with brain activity. 18F-Lfluorodopa<br>
and other dopamine receptor analogs have also been used in mapping dopamine<br>
receptor distribution.<br>
Other halogen isotopes can serve for PET or SPECT imaging, or for conventional<br>
tracer labeling. ITiese include 75Br, 76Br, 77Br and 82Br as having usable half-lives and<br>
emission characteristics. In general, the chemical means exist to substitute any halogen<br>
moiety for the described isotopes. Therefore, the biochemical or physiological activities of<br>
any halogenated homolog of the described compounds are now available for use by those<br>
skilled in the art, including stable isotope halogen homolog. Astatine can be substituted for<br>
other halogen isotypes. 2l°At, for example, emits alpha particles with a half-life of 8.3h.<br>
Other isotopes also emit alpha particles with reasonably useful half-lives. At-substituted<br>
compounds are therefore useful for brain therapy, where binding is sufficiently brainspecific.<br>
Numerous studies have demonstrated increased incorporation of carbohydrates and<br>
amiuo acids into malignant brain cells. This accumulation is associated with accelerated<br>
proliferation and protein synthesis of such cells. The glucose analog 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<br>
D-glucose (2-FDG) has been used for distinguishing highly malignant brain brains from<br>
normal brain tissue or benign growths (DiChiro, G. et al. (1982) Neurology (NY) 32:1323-<br>
1329. However, fluoriue-18 labeled 2-FDG is not the agent of choice for detecting low<br>
grade brain brains because high uptake in normal tissue can mask the presence of a brain. In<br>
addition, fluorine-18 labeled 2-FDG is not the ideal radiopharmaceutical for distinguishing<br>
lung brains from infectious tissue or detecting ovarian carcinoma because of high uptake of<br>
the 2-FDG radioactivity in infectious tissue and in the bladder, respectively. The naturally<br>
occurring amino acid methionine, labeled with carbon-11, has also been used to distinguish<br>
malignant tissue fro in normal tissue. But it too has relatively high uptake in normal tissue.<br>
Moreover, the half-life of carbon-11 is only 20 minutes; therefore Cl 1 methionine can not<br>
be stored for a long period of time.<br>
Cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF") transthyretin ("TTR"), the main CSF thyroxine (T4)<br>
carrier protein in the rat and the human is synthesized in the choroid plexus ("CP"). After<br>
injection of ~ 1-T4 in the rat, radioactive T4 accumulates first in the CP, then in the CSF<br>
and later in the brain (Chanoine JP, Braverman LE. The role of transthyretin in the transport<br>
of thyroid hormone to cerebrospinal fluid and brain. Acta Med Austriaca. 1992; 19 Suppl<br>
1:25-8).<br>
Compounds of the invention provide substantially improved PET imaging for areas<br>
of the body having amyloid protein, especially of the brain. All the available positronemitting<br>
isotopes which could be incorporated into a biologically-active compound have<br>
short half-lives. The practical utility of such labeled compounds is therefore dependent on<br>
how rapidly the labeled compound can be synthesized, the synthetic yield and the<br>
radiochemical purity of the final product. Even the shipping time from the isotope source, a<br>
cyclotron facility, to the hospital or laboratory where PET imaging is to take place, is<br>
limited. A rough calculation of the useful distance is about two miles per minute of half-life.<br>
Thus C11, with a half-life of 20.5m is restricted to about a 40 mile radius from a source<br>
whereas compounds labeled with F18 can be used within about a 200 mile radius. Further<br>
requirements of an l8F-labeled compound are that it have the binding specificity for the<br>
receptor or target molecule it is intended to bind, that non-specific binding to other targets<br>
be sufficiently low to permit distinguishing between target and non-target binding, and that<br>
the label be stable under conditions of the test to avoid exchange with other substances in<br>
the test environment. More particularly, compounds of the invention must display adequate<br>
binding to the desired target while failing to bind to any comparable degree with other<br>
tissues or cells.<br>
A partial solution to the stringent requirements for PET imaging is to employ<br>
.gamma-emitting isotopes in SPECT imaging. I123 is a commonly used isotopic marker for<br>
SPECT, having a half-life of 13 hours for a useful range of over 1000 miles from the site of<br>
1 "71 synthesis. Compounds of the invention can be rapidly and efficiently labeled with I for<br>
use in SPECT analysis as an alternative to PET imaging. Furthermore, because of the fact<br>
that the same compound can be labeled with either isotope, it is possible for the first time to<br>
compare the results obtained by PET and SPECT using the same tracer.<br>
The specificity of brain binding also provides utility for I-substituted compounds of<br>
the invention. Such compounds can be labeled with short-lived I for SPECT imaging or<br>
with longer-lived 125I for longer-term studies such as monitoring a course of therapy. Other<br>
iodine and bromine isotopes can be substituted for those exemplified.<br>
5 The compounds of the invention therefore provide improved methods for brain<br>
imaging using PET and SPECT. The methods entail administering to a subject (which can<br>
be human or animal, for experimental and/or diagnostic purposes) an image-generating<br>
amount of a compound of the invention, labeled with the appropriate isotope and then<br>
measuring the distribution of the compound by PET if F18 or other positron emitter is<br>
10 employed, or SPECT if I123 or other gamma emitter is employed. An image-generating<br>
amount is that amount which is at least able to provide an image in a PET or SPECT<br>
scanner, taking into account the scanner's detection sensitivity and noise level, the age of the<br>
isotope, the body size of the subject and route of administration, all such variables being<br>
exemplary of those known and accounted for by calculations and measurements known to<br>
15 those skilled in the art without resort to undue experimentation.<br>
It will be understood that compounds of the invention can be labeled with an isotope<br>
of any atom or combination of atoms in the structure. While F18,1123, and I125 have been<br>
emphasized herein as being particularly useful for PET, SPECT and tracer analysis, other<br>
uses are contemplated including those flowing from physiological or pharmacological<br>
20 properties of stable isotope homolog and will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The invention also provides for technetium (Tc) labeling via Tc adducts. Isotopes of<br>
Tc, notably Tc99"1, have been used for brain imaging. The present invention provides Tccomplexed<br>
adducts of compounds of the invention, which are useful for brain imaging. The<br>
adducts are Tc-coordination complexes joined to the cyclic amino acid by a 4-6 carbon<br>
25 chain which can be saturated or possess a double or triple bond. Where a double bond is<br>
present, either E (trans) or Z (cis) isomers can be synthesized, and either isomer can be<br>
employed. Synthesis is described for incorporating the 99mTc isotope as a last step, to<br>
maximize the useful life of the isotope.<br>
The following methods were employed in procedures reported herein. 18F-Fluoride<br>
30 was produced from a Seimens cyclotron using the O(p,n) F reaction with 11 MeV<br>
protons on 95% enriched 18O water. All solvents and chemicals were analytical grade and<br>
were used without further purification. Melting points of compounds were determined in<br>
capillary tubes by using a Buchi SP apparatus. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis (TLC)<br>
was performed by using 250-mm thick layers of silica gel G PF-254 coated on aluminum<br>
51<br>
(obtained from Analtech, Inc.). Column chromatography was performed by using 60-200<br>
mesh silica gel (Aldrich Co.). Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a Beckman ISA<br>
specrrophotometer with NaCl plates. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR)<br>
were obtained at 300 MHz with a Nicolet high-resolution instrument.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of using a compound of the<br>
invention for the manufacture of a radiopharmaceutical for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's<br>
disease in a human. In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of preparing<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention as described herein are the thyroid hormone<br>
analogs or other TTR binding ligands, which bind to TTR and have the ability to pass the<br>
blood-brain barrier. The compounds are therefore suited as in vivo diagnostic agents for<br>
imaging of Alzheimer's disease. The detection of radioactivity is performed according to<br>
well-known procedures in the art, either by using a gamma camera or by positron emission<br>
tomography (PET).<br>
Preferably, the free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, e.g. a<br>
monochloride or dichloride salt, of a compound of the invention is used in a galenical<br>
formulation as diagnostic agent. The galenical formulation containing the compound of the<br>
invention optionally contains adjuvants known in the art, e.g. buffers, sodium chloride,<br>
lactic acid, surfactants etc. A sterilization by filtration of the galenical formulation under<br>
sterile conditions prior to usage is possible.<br>
The radioactive dose should be in the range of 1 to 100 mCi, preferably 5 to 30 mCi,<br>
and most preferably 5 to 20 mCi per application.<br>
Of the various aspects of the invention, certain compounds (for example, compounds<br>
disclosed in Examples 16-20) are preferred. Especially preferred are such compounds for<br>
use as diagnostic agents in positron emission tomography (PET).<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route,<br>
preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a<br>
dose effective to bind TTR in the brain and thereby be detected by gamma camera or PET.<br>
Typically, the administration is parenteral., e.g., intravenously, intraperitoneally.,<br>
subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Intraveneous administration is preferred.<br>
Thus, for example, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration which<br>
comprise a solution of contrast media dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier, e.g.,<br>
serum or physiological sodium chloride solution.<br>
Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, saline solutions,<br>
parenteral vehicles such as sodium chloride, Ringer's dextrose, etc. Examples of nonaqueous<br>
solvents are propylerie glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oil and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, non-toxic<br>
excipients, including salts, preservatives, bufers and the like, are described, for instance, in<br>
REMMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 15.sup.th Ed. Easton: Mack<br>
Publishing Co., pp. 1405-1412 and 1461-1487 (1975) and THE NATIONAL<br>
FORMULARY XIV., 14.sup.th Ed. Washington: American Pharmaceutical Association<br>
(1975). Aqueous earners, are preferred.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition of this invention are produced in a manner known per<br>
se by suspending or dissolving the compounds of this invention—optionally combined with<br>
the additives customary in galenic pharmacy—in an aqueous medium and then optionally<br>
sterilizing the suspension or solution. Suitable additives are, for example, physiologically<br>
acceptable buffers (such as, for instance, tromethamine), additions of complexing agents<br>
(e.g., diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) or—if required—electrolytes, e.g., sodium chloride<br>
or—if necessary—antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, for example.<br>
If suspensions or solutions of the compounds of this invention in water or physiological<br>
saline solution are desirable for enteral administration or other purposes, they are mixed<br>
with one or several of the auxiliary agents (e.g.. inethylcellulose, lactose, mannitol) and/or<br>
tensides (e.g., lecithins, "Tween", "Myrj") and/or flavoring agents to improve taste (e.g.,<br>
ethereal oils), as customary in galenic pharmacy.<br>
The compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization<br>
techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for<br>
use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile solution<br>
prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH<br>
adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents and the like, for<br>
example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium<br>
chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc.<br>
For the compounds according to the invention having radioactive halogens, these<br>
compounds can be shipped as "hot" compounds, i.e., with the radioactive halogen in the<br>
compound and administered in e.g., a physiologically acceptable saline solution. In the case<br>
of the metal complexes, these compounds can be shipped as "cold" compounds, i.e., without<br>
the radioactive ion, and then mixed with Tc-generator eluate or Re-generator eluate.<br>
The Role of Thyroid Hormone, Analogs, and Polymeric Conjugations in Modulating the<br>
Actions of Polypeptides Whose Cell Surface Receptors are Clustered Around I n t e g r i n 3 ,<br>
or other RGD-containing Compounds<br>
Integrin aVp3 is a heterodimeric plasma membrane protein with several<br>
extracellular matrix protein ligands containing an an amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp<br>
("ROD"). Using purified integrin, we discovered that integrin ccVp3 binds T4 and that this<br>
interaction is perturbed by aVp3 antagonists. Radioligand-binding studies revealed that<br>
purified aVp3 binds T4 with high affinity (EC50, 371 pM), and appears to bind T4<br>
preferentially over T3. This is consistent with previous reports that show MAPK activation<br>
and nuclear translocation, as well as hormone-induced angiogenesis, by T4, compared to<br>
T3. Integrin aVp3 antagonists inhibit binding of T4 to the integrin and, importantly,<br>
prevent activation by T4 of the MAPK signaling cascade. This functional consequence-<br>
MAPK activation—of hormone-bindmg to the integrin, together with inhibition of the<br>
MAPK-dependent pro- angiogenic action of thyroid hormone by integrin otVp3 antagonists,<br>
allow us to describe the iodothyronine-binding site on the integrin as a receptor. It should<br>
be noted that 3-iodothyronamine, a thyroid hormone derivative, has recently been shown by<br>
Scanlan et al. to bind to a trace amine receptor (TAR I), but the actions of this analog<br>
interestingly are antithetic to those of T4 and T3.<br>
The traditional ligands of integrins are proteins. That a small molecule, thyroid<br>
hormone, is also a ligand of an integrin is a novel finding. The present invention also<br>
discloses that, resveratrol, a polyphenol with some estrogenic activity, binds to integrin<br>
aVp3 with a functional cellular consequence, apoptosis, different from those that result<br>
from the binding of thyroid hormone. The site on the integrin at which T4 binds is at or<br>
near the RGD binding groove of the heterodimeric integrin. It is possible, however, that<br>
aVp3 binds T4 elsewhere on the protein and that the occupation of the RGD recognition<br>
site by tetrac or by RGD-containing peptides allosterically blocks the T4 binding site or<br>
causes a confomiational change within the integrin mat renders the T4 site unavailable.<br>
Accordingly, the modulation by T4 of the laminin-integrin interaction of astrocytes may be<br>
a consequence of binding of the hormone to the integrin. The possibility thus exists that at<br>
the cell exterior thyroid hormone may affect the liganding by integrin aVp3 of extracellular<br>
matrix proteins in addition to laminin.<br>
Actions ot'T4 that are nongenomic in mechanism have been well documented in<br>
recent years. A number of these activities are MAPK-mediated. We have shown that initial<br>
steps in activation of the MAPK cascade by thyroid hormone, including activation of<br>
protein kina.se C, are sensitive to GTPyS and pertussis toxin, indicating that the plasma<br>
membrane receptor for thyroid hormone is G protein-sensitive. It should be noted that<br>
certain cellular functions mediated by integrin aVp3 have been shown by others to be G<br>
protein-modulated. For example, site-directed mutagenesis of the RGD binding domain<br>
abolishes the ability of the nucleotide receptor P2Y2 to activate Go, while the activation of<br>
Gq, was not affected. Wang et al. demonstrated that an integrin-associated protein,<br>
IAP/CD47, induced smooth muscle cell migration via Gj-mediated inhibition of MAPK<br>
activation.<br>
In addition to linking the binding of T4 and other analogs by integrin ctV|33 to<br>
activation of a specific intracellular signal transduction pathway, the present invention also<br>
discloses that the liganding of the hormone by the integrin is critical to induction by T4 of<br>
MAPK-dependent angiogenesis. In the CAM model, significant vessel growth occurs after<br>
48-72 h of T4 treatment, indicating that the plasma membrane effects of T4 can result in<br>
complex transcriptiona] changes. Thus, what is initiated as a nongenomic action of the<br>
hormone—transduction of the cell surface T4 signal—interfaces with genomic effects of the<br>
hormone that culminate in neovascularization. Interfaces of nongenomic and genomic<br>
20 actions of thyroid hormone have previously been described, e.g., MAPK-dependent<br>
phosphorylation at Ser-142 of TRJ31 that is initiated at the cell surface by T4 and that results<br>
in shedding by TR of corepressor proteins and recruitment of coactivators. The instant<br>
invention also discloses that T4 stimulates growth of C-6 glial cells by a MAPK-dependent<br>
mechanism that is inhibited by RGD peptide, and mat thyroid hormone causes MAPKmediated<br>
serine- phosphorylation of the nuclear estrogen receptor (ERcc) in MCF-7 cells by<br>
a process we now know to be inhibitable by an RGD peptide. These findings in several cell<br>
lines all support the participation of the integrin in functional responses of cells to thyroid<br>
hormone.<br>
Identification of aV{33 as a membrane receptor for thyroid hormoneindicates clinical<br>
significance of the interaction of the integrin and the hormone and the downstream<br>
consequence of angiogenesis. For example, oxV(33 is overexpressed in many tumors and this<br>
overexpression appears to play a role in tumor invasion and growth. Relatively constant<br>
circulating levels of thyroid hormone can facilitate tumor-associated angiogenesis. In<br>
addition to demonstrating the pro-angiogenic action of T4 in the CAM model here and<br>
elsewhere, the present invention also discloses that human dermal microvascular endothelial<br>
cells also form new blood vessels when exposed to thyroid hormone. Local delivery of<br>
aVp3 antagonists or tetrac around tumor cells might inhibit thyroid hormone- stimulated<br>
angiogenesis. Although tetrac lacks many of the biologic activities of thyroid hormone, it<br>
does gain access to the interior of'certain cells. Anchoring of tetrac, or specific RGD<br>
antagonists, to non-immunogenic substrates (agarose or polymers) would exclude the<br>
possibility that the compounds could cross the plasma membrane, yet retain as shown here<br>
the ability to prevent T4-induced angiogenesis. The agarose-T4 used in the present studies<br>
is thus a prototype for a new family of thyroid hormone analogues that have specific cellular<br>
effects, but do not gain access to the cell interior.<br>
Accordingly, the Examples herein identify integrin ccVp3 as a cell surface receptor<br>
for thyroid hormone (L-thyroxine, T4) and as the initiation site for T4-induced activation of<br>
intracellular signaling cascades. aV(33 dissociably binds radiolabeled T4 with high affinity;<br>
radioligand-binding is displaced by tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), aV[33 antibodies and<br>
by an integrin RGD recognition site peptide. CV-1 cells lack nuclear thyroid hormone<br>
receptor but bear plasma membrane ctVp3; treatment of these cells with physiological<br>
concentrations of T4 activates the MAPK pathway, an effect inhibited by tetrac, RGD<br>
peptide and aVpS antibodies. Inhibitors of T4-binding to the integrin also block the MAPKmediated<br>
pro- angiogenic action of T4. T4-induced phosphorylation of MAPK is blocked by<br>
siRNA knockdown of ctV and P3. These findings indicate that T4 binds to aVp3 near the<br>
RGD recognition site and show that hormone-binding to <xvp3 has physiologic></xvp3>
consequences.<br>
The Role of Thyroid Hormone, Analogs, and Polymeric Conjugations in Inhibiting<br>
Angiogenesis<br>
The invention also provides, in another part, compositions and methods for<br>
inhibiting angiogenesis in a subject in need thereof. Conditions amenable to treatment by<br>
inhibiting angiogenesis include, for example, primary or metastatic tumors and diabetic<br>
retinopathy. The compositions can include an effective amount of TETRAC, TRIAC or<br>
mAb LM609. The compositions can be in the form of a sterile, injectable, pharmaceutical<br>
formulation that includes an anti-angiogenically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic<br>
substance in a physiologically and phamiaceuticaUy acceptable carrier, optionally with one<br>
or more excipients.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a condition amenable<br>
TO treatment by inhibiting angiogenesis by administering to a subject in need thereof an<br>
amount of an anti-angiogenesis agent effective for inhibiting angiogenesis.<br>
Examples of the anti-angiogenesis agents used for inhibiting angiogenesis are also<br>
provided by the invention and include,, but are not limited to, tetraiodothyroacetic acid<br>
(TETRAC), triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC), monoclonal antibody LM609, or<br>
combinations thereof. Such anti-angiogenesis agents can act at the cell surface to inhibit the<br>
pro-angiogenesis agents.<br>
Cancer-Related New Blood Vessel Growth<br>
Examples of the conditions amenable to treatment by inhibiting angiogenesis include,<br>
but are not limited to, primary or metastatic tumors, including, but not limited to glioma and<br>
breast cancer. In such a method, compounds which inhibit the thyroid hormone-induced<br>
angiogenic effect are used to inhibit angiogenesis. Details of such a method is illustrated in<br>
Example 12.<br>
Diabetic Reitinorjathy<br>
Examples of the conditions amenable to treatment by inhibiting angiogenesis include,<br>
but are not limited to diabetic retinopathy, and related conditions. In such a method, compounds<br>
which inhibit the thyroid hormone-induced angiogenic effect are used to inhibit angiogenesis.<br>
Details of such a method is illustrated in Examples 8A and B.<br>
It is known that proliferative retiuopathy induced by hypoxia (rather than diabetes)<br>
depends upon alphaV (aV) integrin expression (E Chavakis et al, Diabetologia 45:262-267,<br>
2002). It is proposed herein that thyroid hormone action on a specific integrin alphaVbeta-3<br>
(aVfS3) is permissive in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Integrin ccVp3 is identified<br>
herein as the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone, its analogs, and<br>
polymer conjugations, act via this receptor to induce angiogenesis.<br>
Method^fTreatment_and F'orrnulations<br>
Thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives can be used in a method for<br>
promoting angiogenesis in a patient in need thereof. The method involves the co-administration<br>
of an effective amount of thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives in low,<br>
daily dosages for a week or more. The method may be used as a treatment to restore cardiac<br>
function after a myocardial infarction. The method may also be used to improve blood flow in<br>
patients with coronaiy artery disease suffering from myocardial ischemia or inadequate blood<br>
flow to areas other than the heart, for example, peripheral vascular disease, for example,<br>
peripheral arterial occlusive disease, where decreased blood flow is a problem.<br>
The compounds can be administered via any medically acceptable means which is<br>
suitable for the compound to be administered, including oral, rectal, topical or parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous) administration. For example,<br>
adenosine has a very short half-life. For this reason, it is preferably administered intravenously.<br>
However, adenosine A.sub.2 agonists have been developed which have much longer half-lives,<br>
and which can be administered through other means. Thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric<br>
forms, and derivatives can be administered, for example, intravenously, oral, topical, intranasal<br>
administration.<br>
In some embodiments, the thyroid hormone analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives<br>
are administered via different means.<br>
The amounts of the thyroid hormone, its analogs, polymeric forms, and derivatives<br>
required to be effective in stimulating angiogenesis will, of course, vary with the individual<br>
being treated and is ultimately at the discretion of the physician. The factors to be considered<br>
include the condition of the patient being treated, the efficacy of the particular adenosine A2<br>
receptor agonist being used, the nature of the formulation, and the patient's body weight.<br>
Occlusion-treating dosages of thyroid hormone analogs or its polymeric forms, and derivatives<br>
are any dosages that provide the desired effect.<br>
The compounds described above are preferably administered in a formulation including<br>
thyroid hormone analogs or its polymeric forms, and derivatives together with an acceptable<br>
carrier for the mode of administration. Any formulation or drug delivery system containing the<br>
active ingredients, which is suitable for the intended use, as are generally known to those of<br>
skill in the art, can be used. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for oral, rectal, topical<br>
or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intravenous)<br>
administration are known to those of skill in the art. The carrier must be phaimaceutically<br>
acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and<br>
not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently include<br>
sterileaqueous preparation of the active compound, which is preferably isotonic with the<br>
blood of the recipient. Thus, such formulations may conveniently contain distilled water,<br>
5% dextrose in distilled water or saline. Useful formulations also include concentrated<br>
solutions or solids containing the compound of formula (I), which upon dilution with an<br>
appropriate solvent give a solution suitable for parental administration above.<br>
For enteral administration, a compound can be incorporated into an inert carrier in<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined<br>
amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; or a suspension or solution in an<br>
aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid, e.g., a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or a draught.<br>
Suitable carriers may be starches or sugars and include lubricants, flavorings, binders, and<br>
other materials of the same nature.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more<br>
accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets maybe prepared by compressing in a suitable<br>
machine the active compound in a free-flowing form, e.g., a powder or granules, optionally<br>
mixed with accessory ingredients, e.g., binders, lubricants, inert diluents, surface active or<br>
dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture<br>
of the powdered active compound with any suitable carrier.<br>
A syrup or suspension may be made by adding the active compound to a<br>
concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar, e.g., sucrose, to which may also be added any<br>
accessory ingredients. Such accessory ingredients may include flavoring, an agent to retard<br>
crystallization of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, e.g.,<br>
as a polyhydric alcohol, for example, glycerol or sorbitol.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a<br>
conventional carrier, e.g., cocoa butter or Witepsol S55 (trademark of Dynamite Nobel<br>
Chemical, Germany), for a suppository base.<br>
Alternatively, the compound may be administered in liposomes or microspheres (or<br>
aucroparticles). Methods for preparing liposomes and microspheres for administration to a<br>
jatient are well known to those of skill in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,734, the contents of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference, describes methods for encapsulating biological<br>
materials iu liposomes. Essentially, the material is dissolved in an aqueous solution, the<br>
appropriate phospholipids and lipids added, along with surfactants if required, and the<br>
material dialyzed or sonicated, as necessary. A review of known methods is provided by G.<br>
Gregoriadis, Chapter 14, "Liposomes," Drug Carriers in Biology and Medicine, pp. 287-341<br>
(Academic Press, 1979).<br>
Microspheres formed of polymers or proteins are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art, and can be tailored for passage through the gastrointestinal tract directly into the blood<br>
stream. Alternatively, the compound can be incorporated and the microspheres, or<br>
composite of microspheres, implanted for slow release over a period of time ranging from<br>
days to months. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,906,474,4,925,673 and 3,625,214, and<br>
Jein, TIPS 19:155-157 (1998), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the thyroid hormone analogs or its polymeric forms, and<br>
adenosine derivatives can be formulated into a liposome or microparticle, which is suitably<br>
sized to lodge in capillary beds following intravenous administration. When the liposome or<br>
microparticle is lodged in the capillary beds surrounding ischemic tissue, the agents can be<br>
administered locally to the site at which they can be most effective. Suitable liposomes for<br>
targeting ischemic tissue are generally less than about 200 nanometers and are also typically<br>
unilamellar vesicles, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,688 to<br>
Baldeschweiler, entitled "Liposomal targeting of ischemic tissue," the contents of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferred microparticles are those prepared from biodegradable polymers, such as<br>
polyglycolide, polylactide and copolymers thereof. Those of skill in the art can readily<br>
determine an appropriate carrier system depending on various factors, including the desired<br>
rate of drug release and the desired dosage.<br>
In one embodiment, the formulations are administered via catheter directly to the<br>
inside of blood vessels. The administration can occur, for example, through holes in the<br>
catheter. In those embodiments wherein the active compounds have a relatively long half<br>
life (on the order of 1 day to a week or more), the formulations can be included in<br>
biodegradable polymeric hydrogels, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,016 to<br>
Hubbell et al. These polymeric hydrogels can be delivered to the inside of a tissue lumen<br>
and the active compounds released over time as the polymer degrades. If desirable, the<br>
polymeric hydrogels can have microparticles or liposomes which include the active<br>
compound dispersed therein, providing another mechanism for the controlled release of the<br>
active compounds.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the<br>
step of bringing the active compound into association with a carrier, which constitutes one<br>
or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and<br>
intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier or a finely<br>
divided solid carrier and then, if necessary, shaping the product into desired unit dosage<br>
form.<br>
The formulations can optionally include additional components, such as various<br>
biologically active substances such as growth factors (including TGF-.beta., basic fibroblast<br>
growth factor (FGF2), epithelial growth factor (EOF), transforming growth factors .alpha,<br>
and .beta. (TGF alpha, and beta.), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor<br>
(PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF)),<br>
antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immuno-suppressant, analgesic, vascularizing<br>
agent, and cell adhesion molecule.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations may further include<br>
one or more optional accessory ingredient(s) utilized in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations, e.g., diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface active agents,<br>
thickeners, lubricants, suspending agents, preservatives (including antioxidants) and the<br>
like.<br>
Formulations and Methods of Treatment<br>
Polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors inducers, or agonists of polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors<br>
receptors of the present invention may be administered by any route which is compatible<br>
with the particular polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducer, or agonist employed. Thus, as<br>
appropriate, administration may be oral or parenteral, including intravenous and<br>
61<br>
intraperitoneal routes of administration. In addition, administration may be by periodic<br>
injections of a bolus of the polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with<br>
nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducer or agonist, or may be made<br>
more continuous by intravenous or intraperitoneal administration from a reservoir which is<br>
external (e.g., an i.v. bag) or internal (e.g., a bioerodable implant, or a colony of implanted,<br>
polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors-producing cells).<br>
Therapeutic agents of the invention (i.e., polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone<br>
or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducers or<br>
agonists of polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors receptors) may be provided to an individual by any<br>
suitable means, directly (e.g., locally, as by injection, implantation or topical administration<br>
to a tissue locus) or systemically (e.g., parenterally or orally). Where, the agent is to be<br>
provided parenterally, such as by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramolecular, ophthalmic,<br>
intraperitoneal, intramuscular, buccal, rectal, vaginal, intraorbital, intracerebral, intracranial,<br>
intraspinal, intraventricular, intrathecal, intracisternal, intracapsular, intranasal or by aerosol<br>
administration, the agent preferably comprises part of an aqueous or physiologically<br>
compatible fluid suspension or solution. Thus, the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors carrier or<br>
vehicle is physiologically acceptable so that in addition to delivery of the desired agent to<br>
the patient, it does not otherwise adversely affect the patient's electrolyte and/or volume<br>
balance. The fluid medium for the agent thus can comprise normal physiologic saline (e.g.,<br>
9.85% aqueous NaCl, 0.15M, pH 7-7.4).<br>
Association of the dimer with a polymeric thyroid hormone analog pro domain<br>
results in the pro form of the polymeric thyroid hormone analog which typically is more<br>
soluble in physiological solutions than the corresponding mature form.<br>
Useful solutions for parenteral administration may be prepared by any of the<br>
methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, described, for example, in REMINGTON'S<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Gennaro, A., ed.), Mack Pub., 1990. Formulations of<br>
the therapeutic agents of the invention may include, for example, polyalkylene glycols such<br>
as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes, and the like.<br>
Formulations for direct administration, in particular, may include glycerol and other<br>
compositions of high viscosity to help maintain the agent at the desired locus.<br>
Biocompatible, preferably bioresorbable, polymers, including, for example, hyaluronic acid,<br>
collagen, tricalciurn phosphate, polybutyrafe, lactide, and glycolide polymers and<br>
lactide/glycolide copolymers, may be useful excipients to control the release of the agent in<br>
vivo. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for these agents include ethylenevinyl<br>
acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and<br>
liposomes. Formulations for inhalation administration contain as excipients, for example,<br>
lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-94auryl<br>
ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of<br>
nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for parenteral administration<br>
may also include glycocholate for buccal administration, methoxysalicylate for rectal<br>
administration, or cutric acid for vaginal administration. Suppositories for rectal<br>
administration may also be prepared by mixing the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducer or<br>
agonist with a non-irritating excipient such as cocoa butter or other compositions which are<br>
solid at room temperature and liquid at body temperatures.<br>
Formulations for topical administration to the skin surface may be prepared by<br>
dispersing the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factor's, inducer or agonist with a dermatologically<br>
acceptable carrier such as a lotion, cream, ointment or soap. Particularly useful are carriers<br>
capable of forming a film or layer over the skin to localize application and inhibit removal.<br>
For topical administration to internal tissue surfaces, the agent may be dispersed in a liquid<br>
tissue adhesive or other substance known to enhance adsorption to a tissue surface. For<br>
example, hydroxypropylcellulose or fibrinogen/thrombin solutions may be used to<br>
advantage. Alternatively, tissue-coating solutions, such as pectin-containing formulations<br>
maybe used.<br>
Alternatively, the agents described herein may be administered orally. Oral<br>
administration of proteins as therapeutics generally is not practiced, as most proteins are<br>
readily degraded by digestive enzymes and acids in the mammalian digestive system before<br>
they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. However, the polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors<br>
described herein typically are acid stable and protease-resistant (see, for example, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,968,590). In addition, OP-1, has been identified in mammary gland extract, colostrum<br>
and 57-day milk. Moreover, the OP-1 purified from mammary gland extract is<br>
morphogenically-active and is also detected in the bloodstream. Maternal administration,<br>
via ingested milk, may be a natural delivery route of TGF-P superfamily proteins. Letterio,<br>
etal., Science 264: 1936-1938 (1994), report that TGF-P is present in murine milk, and that<br>
radiolabelled TGF-P is absorbed by gastrointestinal mucosa of suckling juveniles. Labeled,<br>
ingested TGF-P appears rapidly in intact form in the juveniles' body tissues, including lung,<br>
heart and liver. Finally, soluble form polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, e.g., mature polymeric<br>
thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other<br>
neurogenesis factors with or without anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory agents. These<br>
findings, as well as those disclosed in the examples below, indicate that oral and parenteral<br>
administration are viable means for administering TGF-P superfamily proteins, including<br>
the polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors, to an individual. In addition, while the mature forms of certain<br>
polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors described herein typically are sparingly soluble, the polymeric thyroid<br>
analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors form<br>
found in milk (and mammary gland extract and colostrum) is readily soluble, probably by<br>
association of the mature, morphogenically-active form with part or all of the pro domain of<br>
the expressed, full length polypeptide sequence and/or by association with one or more milk<br>
components. Accordingly, the compounds provided herein may also be associated with<br>
molecules capable of enhancing their solubility in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Where the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors is intended for use as a therapeutic for<br>
disorders of the CNS, an additional problem must be addressed: overcoming the blood-brain<br>
barrier, the brain capillary wall structure that effectively screens out all but selected<br>
categories of substances present in the blood, preventing their passage into the brain. The<br>
blood-brain barrier can be bypassed effectively by direct infusion of the polymeric thyroid<br>
hormone analogs into the brain, or by intranasal administration or inhalation of formulations<br>
suitable for uptake and retrograde transport by olfactory neurons. Alternatively, the<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs can be modified to enhance its transport across the<br>
blood-brain barrier. For example, truncated forms of the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs<br>
alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors or a<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or<br>
other neurogenesis factors-stimulating agent may be most successful. Alternatively, the<br>
polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or<br>
other neurogenesis factors, inducers or agonists provided herein can be derivatized or<br>
conjugated to a lipophilic moiety or to a substance that is actively transported across the<br>
blood-brain barrier, using standard means known to those skilled in the art. See, for<br>
example, Pardridge, Endocrine Reviews 7: 314-330 (1986) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,575.<br>
The compounds provided herein may also be associated with molecules capable of<br>
targeting the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve<br>
growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducer or agonist to the desired tissue. For<br>
example, an antibody, antibody fragment, or other binding protein that interacts specifically<br>
with a surface molecule on cells of the desired tissue, may be used. Useful targeting<br>
molecules may be designed, for example, using the single chain binding site technology<br>
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,513. Targeting molecules can be covalently or noncovalently<br>
associated with the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination<br>
with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducer or agonist.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the formulated<br>
compositions contain therapeutically-effective amounts of the polymeric thyroid hormone<br>
analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors,<br>
inducers or agonists thereof. That is, they contain an amount which provides appropriate<br>
concentrations of the agent to the affected nervous system tissue for a time sufficient to<br>
stimulate a detectable restoration of impaired central or peripheral nervous system function,<br>
up to and including a complete restoration thereof. As will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art, these concentrations will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the<br>
biological efficacy of the selected agent, the chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity)<br>
of the specific agent, the formulation thereof, including a mixture with one or more<br>
excipients, the administration route, and the treatment envisioned, including whether the<br>
active ingredient will be administered directly into a tissue site, or whether it will be<br>
administered systernically. The preferred dosage to be administered is also likely to depend<br>
on variables such as the condition of the diseased or damaged tissues, and the overall health<br>
status of the particular mammal. As a general matter, single, daily, biweekly or weekly<br>
dosages of 0.00001-1000 mg of a polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with<br>
nerve growth factor or other neurogenesis factors are sufficient in the presence of antioxidant<br>
and / or anti-iriflaminatory agents, with 0.0001-100 mg being preferable, and 0.001<br>
to 10 mg being even more preferable. Alternatively, a single, daily, biweekly or weekly<br>
dosage of 0.01-1000 .nm.g/kg body weight, more preferably 0.01-10 mg/kg body weight,<br>
may be advantageously employed. The present effective dose can be administered in a<br>
single dose or in a plurality (two or more) of installment doses, as desired or considered<br>
appropriate under the specific circumstances. A bolus injection or diffusable infusion<br>
formulation can be used. If desired to facilitate repeated or frequent infusions, implantation<br>
of a semi-permanent stent (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracisternal or intracapsular)<br>
maybe advisable.<br>
The polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors, inducers or agonists of the invention may, of course,<br>
be administered alone or in combination with other molecules known to be beneficial in the<br>
treatment of the conditions described herein. For example, various well-known growth<br>
factors, hormones, enzymes, therapeutic compositions, antibiotics, or other bioactive agents<br>
can also be administered with the polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in<br>
combination with nerve growth factors or other neurogenesis factors. Thus, various known<br>
growth factors such as NGF, EOF, PDGF, IGF, FGF, TGF-ce, and TGF-p, as well as<br>
enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, free radical scavenging<br>
agents, antibiotics and/or ehemoattractant/chemotactic factors, can be included in the<br>
present polymeric thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth<br>
factors or other neurogenesis factors formulation.<br>

Co. (St. Louis, MO) or through VWR Scientific (Bridgeport, NT). Cortisone acetate, bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA) and gelatin solution (2% type B from bovine skin) were purchased<br>
from Sigma Chemical Co. Fertilized chicken eggs were purchased from Charles River<br>
Laboratories, SPAFAS Avian Products &amp; Services (North Franklin, CT). T4 , 3,5,3'-<br>
triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), T4 -agarose, 6-N-propyl-2-<br>
thiouracil (PTU), RGD-contaming peptides, and RGB-containing peptides were obtained<br>

(Basel, Switzerland). Polyclonal anti-FGF2 and monoclonal anti- p-actin were obtained<br>
from Santa Crux Biotechnology and human recombinant FGF2 and VEGF from Invitrogen.<br>
Polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated ERK1/2 was from New England Biolabs and goat<br>
anti-rabbit IgG from DAKO. Monoclonal antibodies to ocVpS (SC73 12) and a-tubulin<br>
 (E9) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Normal mouse IgG<br>
and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig were purchased from Dako Cytomation<br>
(Carpinteria, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to aV|33 (LM609) and aVp5 (P1F6), as well as<br>
purified aV(33, were purciiased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). L-[125I]-l&gt;4(specific<br>
activity, 1250 p.( 'i/ug) was obtained from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA),<br>
Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) Model of Angiogenesis: In vivo<br>
iSfeovascularization was examined by methods described previously. 9-12 Ten-day-old<br>
chick embryos were purchased from SPAFAS (Preston, CT) and incubated at 37°C with<br>
55% relative humidity. A hypodermic needle was used to make a small hole in the shell<br>
concealing the air sac, and a second hole was made on the broad side of the egg, directly<br>
over an avascular portion of the embryonic membrane that was identified by candling. A<br>
false air sac was created beneath the second hole by the application of negative pressure at<br>
the first hole, causing the CAM to separate from the shell. A window approximately 1.0 cm<br>
2 was cut in the shell over the dropped CAM with a small-crafts grinding wheel (Dremel,<br>
division of Emerson Electric Co.), allowing direct access to the underlying CAM. FGF2<br>
(1/ig/mL) was used as a standard proangiogenic agent to induce new blood vessel branches<br>
on the CAM of 10-day-old embryos. Sterile disks of No. 1 filter paper (Whatman<br>
International) were pretreated with 3 mg/mL cortisone acetate and 1 mmol/L PTU and air<br>
dried under sterile conditions. Thyroid hormone, hormone analogues, FGF2 or control<br>
solvents, and inhibitors were then applied to the disks and the disks allowed to dry. The<br>
disks were then suspended in PBS and placed on growing CAMs. Filters treated with T4 or<br>
FGF2 were placed on the first day of the 3-day incubation, with antibody to FGF2 added <br>
minutes later to selected samples as indicated. At 24 hours, the MAPK cascade inhibitor PD<br>
98059 was also added to CAMs topically by means of the filter disks.<br>
Microscopic Analysis of CAM Sections: After incubation at 37°C with 55%<br>
relative humidity for 3 days, the CAM tissue directly beneath each filter disk was resected<br>
from control and treated CAM samples. Tissues were washed 3X with PBS, placed in 35-<br>
mm Petri dishes (Nalge Nunc), and examined under an SV6 stereomicroscope (Zeiss) at<br>
X50 magnification. Digital images of CAM sections exposed to filters were collected using<br>
a 3-charge-coupled device color video camera system (Toshiba) and analyzed with Image-<br>
Pro software (Media Cybernetics), The number of vessel branch points contained in a<br>
circular region equal to the area of each filter disk were counted. One image was counted in<br>
each CAM preparation, and findings from 8 to 10 CAM preparations were analyzed for<br>
each treatment condition (thyroid hormone or analogues, FGF2, FGF2 antibody, PD<br>
98059). In addition, each experiment was performed 3 times. The resulting angiogenesis<br>
index is the mean ±SEM of new branch points in each set of samples.<br>
FGF2 Assays: ECV304 endothelial cells were cultured in Ml99 medium supple<br>
merited with 10% fetal bovine serum. ECV304 cells (106 cells) were plated on 0.2% gelcoated<br>
24-well plates in complete medium overnight, and the cells were then washed with<br>
serum-free medium and treated with T4 or T3 as indicated. After 72 hours, the supernatants<br>
were harvested and assays for FGF performed without dilution using a commercial ELISA<br>

MAPK Activation: ECV304 endothelial cells were cultured in Ml99 medium with<br>
0.25% hormone-depleted serum 13 for 2 days. Cells were men treated with T4 (10~7 mol/L)<br>
for 15 minutes to 6 hours. In additional experiments, cells were treated with T4 or FGF2 or<br>
with T4 in the presence of PD 98059 or CGP41251. Nuclear fractions were pre-pared from<br>
all samples by our method reported previously, the proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel<br>
electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes for immunoblotting with antibody to<br>
phosphorylated ERK 1/2. The appearance of nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 signifies<br>
activation of these MAPK isoforms by T4 .<br>
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction: Confluent ECV304 cells in<br>
10-cm plates were treated with T4 (10~7 mol/L) for 6 to 48 hours and total RNA extracted<br>
using guanidinium isothiocyanate (Biotecx Laboratories). RNA (1 ug) was subjected to<br>
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Access RT-PCR<br>
system (Promega). Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA at 48°C for 45 minutes,<br>
then denatured at 94°C for 2 minutes. Second-strand synthesis and PCR amplification were<br>
performed for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 60 s, and<br>
extension at 68°C for 120 s, with final ex-tension for 7 minutes at 68°C after completion of<br>
all cycles. PCR primers for FGF2 were as follows: FGF2 sense strand 5'-<br>
TGGTATGTGGCACTGAAACG-3' (SEQ ID NO:1), antisense strand 5'<br>
CTCAATGACCTGGCGAAGAC-3' (SEQ ID NO:2); the length of the PCR product was<br>
734 bp. Primers for GAPDH included the sense strand 5'-<br>
AAGGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAACG-3' (SEQ ID NO:3), and antisense strand 5'-<br>
GGGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGTCAGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:4); the length of the PCR product<br>
was 218 bp. The products of RT-PCR were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose<br>
gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The target bands of the gel were quantified<br>
using Lablmage software (Kapelan), and the value for [FGF2/GAPDHJX10 calculated for<br>
each rime point.<br>
Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed by 1-way analysis of<br>
variance (ANOV A) comparing experimental with respective control group and statistical<br>
significance was calculated based on P 
In vivo angiogenesis in Matrigel FGFi or Cancer cell lines implant in mice: In<br>
Vivo Murine Angiogenesis Model: The murine matrigel model will be conducted<br>
according to previously described methods (Grant et al., 1991; Okada et al., 1995) and as<br>
implemented in our laboratory (Powel et al., 2000). Briefly, growth factor free matrigel<br>
(Becton Dickinson, Bedford MA) will be thawed overnight at 4°C and placed on ice.<br>
Aliquots of matrigel will be placed into cold polypropylene tubes and FGF2, thyroid<br>
hormone analogs or cancer cells (1 x 106 cells) will be added to the matrigel. Matrigel with<br>
Saline, FGF2, thyroid hormone analogs or cancer cells will be subcutaneously injected into<br>
the ventral midline of the mice. At day 14, the mice will be sacrificed and the solidified<br>
gels will be resected and analyzed for presence of new vessels. Compounds A-D will be<br>
injected subcutaneously at different doses. Control and experimental gel implants will be<br>
placed in a micro centrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of cell lysis solution (Sigma, St. Louis,<br>
20 MO) and crushed with a pestle. Subsequently, the tubes will be allowed to incubate<br>
overnight at 4°C and centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 15 minutes on the following day. A 200<br>
(j.1 aliquot of cell lysate will be added to 1.3 ml of Drabkin's reagent solution (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) for each sample. The solution will be analyzed on a spectrophotometer at a 540<br>
nm. The absorption of light is proportional to the amount of hemoglobin contained in the<br>
sample.<br>
Tumor growth and metastasis - Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) model<br>
of tumor implant: The protocol is as previously described (Kim et al., 2001). Briefly, 1 x<br>
107 tumor cells will be placed on the surface of each CAM (7 day old embryo) and<br>
incubated for one week. The resulting tumors will be excised and cut into 50 mg fragments.<br>
These fragments will be placed on additional 10 CAMs per group and treated topically the<br>
following day with 25 ul of compounds (A-D) dissolved in PBS. Seven days later, tumors<br>
will then be excised from the egg and tumor weights will be determined for each CAM.<br>
Figure 8 is a diagrammatic sketch showing the steps involved in the in vivo tumor growth<br>
model in the CAM.<br>
The effects of TETRAC, TRIAC, and thyroid hormone antagonists on tumor growth<br>
rate, tumor angiogeriesis, and tumor metastasis of cancer cell lines can be determined.<br>
Tumor growth aud metastasis -Tumor Xenograft model in mice: The model is as<br>
described in our publications by Kerr et al., 2000; Van Waes et al., 2000; Ali et al., 2001;<br>
and Ali et al., 2001, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The<br>
anti-cancer efficacy for TETRAC, TRIAC, and other thyroid hormone antagonists at<br>
different doses and against different tumor types can be determined and compared.<br>
Tumor growth and metastasis -Experimental Model of Metastasis: The model is<br>
as described in our recent publications (Mousa, 2002; Amirkhosravi et al., 2003a and<br>
2003b, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Briefly, B16<br>
murine malignant melanoma cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and other cancer lines will be<br>
cultured in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum, penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells will be cultured to 70%<br>
confluency and harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) and washed twice with phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS). Cells will be re-suspended in PBS at a concentration of either 2.0 x<br>
105 cells/ml for experimental metastasis. Animals: C57/BL6 mice (Harlan, Indianapolis,<br>
Indiana) weighing 18-21 grams will be used for this study. All procedures are in<br>
accordance with IACUC and institutional guidelines. The anti-cancer efficacy for<br>
TETRAC, TRIAC, and other thyroid hormone antagonists at different doses and against<br>
different tumor types can be determined and compared.<br>
Effect of" thyroid hormone analogues on angiogenesis.<br>
T4 induced significant increase in angiogenesis index (fold increase above basal) in<br>
the CAM model. T3 at 0.001-1.0 iiM or T4 at 0.1-1.0 pM achieved maximal effect in<br>
producing 2-2.5 fold increase in angiogenesis index as compared to 2-3 fold increase in<br>
angiogenesis index by 1 ixg of FGF2 (Table 1 and Figure la and Ib). The effect of T4 in<br>
promoting angiogenesis (2-2.5 fold increase in angiogenesis index) was achieved in the<br>
presence or absence of PTU, which inhibit T4 to T3 conversion. T3 itself at 91-100 nM)-<br>
induced potent pro-angiogenic effect in the CAM model. T4 agarose produced similar pro-<br>
angiogenesis effect to that achieved by T4 The pro-angiogenic effect of either T4 or T4-<br>
agarose was 100% blocked by TETRAC or TRIAC.<br>
Enhancement of pro-angiogenic activity of FGF2 by sub-maximal concentrations<br>
of T4.<br>
The combination of T4 and FGF2 at sub-maximal concentrations resulted in an<br>
additive increase in the angiogenesis index up to the same level like the maximal proangiogenesis<br>
effect of either FGF2 or T4 (Figure 2).<br>
Effects of MAPK cascade inhibitors on the pro-angiogenic actions of T4 and<br>
FGf2 n the CAM model. The pro-angiogenesis effect of either T4 or FGF2 was totally<br>
blocked by PD 98059 at 0.8 - 8 p.g (Figure 3).<br>
Effects of specific integrin otvps antagonists on the pro-angiogenic actions of T4<br>
and FGf2 n the CAM model. The pro-angiogenesis effect of either T4 or FGF2 was<br>
totally blocked by the specific monoclonal antibody LM609 at 10 μg (Figure 4a and 4b).<br>
The CAM assay has been used to validate angiogenic activity of a variety of growth<br>
factors and other promoters or inhibitors of angiogenesis. In the present studies, T4 in<br>
physiological concentrations was shown to be pro-angiogenic, with comparable activity to<br>
that of FGF2. The presence of PTU did not reduce the effect of T4, indicating that deiodination<br>
of T4 to generate Ta was not a prerequisite in this model. Because the appearance<br>
of new blood vessel growth in this model requires several days, we assumed that the effect<br>
of thyroid hormone was totally dependent upon the interaction of the nuclear receptor for<br>
thyroid honnone (TR). Actions of iodothyronines that require intranuclear complexing of TR<br>
with its natural ligand, Ta, are by definition, genomic, and culminate in gene expression.<br>
On the other hand, the preferential response of this model system to T.4—rather than T3, the<br>
natural ligand of TR raised the possibility that angiogenesis might be initiated nongnomic<br>
ally at the plasma membrane by T.4 and culminate in effects that require gene<br>
transcription. Non-genomic actions of 14 have been widely described, are usually initiated<br>
at the plasma membrane and may be mediated by signal transduction pathways. They do<br>
not require intranuclear ligand binding of iodothyronine and TR, but may interface with or<br>
modulate gene transcription. Non-genomic actions of steroids have also been well-described<br>
and are known to interface with genomic actions of steroids or of other compounds.<br>
Experiments carried out with T4 and tetrac or with agarose-T4 indicated that the proangiogenic<br>
effect of T^ indeed very likely was initiated at the plasma membrane. We have<br>
shown elsewhere that tetrac blocks membrane-initiated effects of T4, but does not, itself,<br>
activate signal transduction . Thus, it is a probe for non-genomic actions of thyroid<br>
hormone. Agarose-T4 is thought not to gain entry to the cell interior and has been used by<br>
us and others to examine models for possible cell surface-initiated actions of the hormone.<br>
These results suggest that another consequence of activation of MAPKby thyroid<br>
hormone is new blood vessel growth. The latter is initiated nongenomically, but of course<br>
requires a consequent complex gene transcription program.<br>
The ambient concentrations of thyroid hormone are relatively stable. The CAM<br>
model, at the time we tested it, was thyroprival and thus may be regarded as a system,<br>
which does not reproduce the intact organism. We propose that circulating levels of T4<br>
serve, with a variety of other regulators, to modulate the sensitivity of vessels to<br>
endogenous angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and FGF2.<br>
Three-Dimensional Angiogenesis Assay<br>
In Vitro Three-Dimensional Sprout Angiogenesis of Human Dermal Micro-Vascular<br>
Endothelial Cells (HDMEC) Cultured on Micro-Carrier Beads Coated with Fibrin:<br>
Confluent HDMEC (passages 5-10) were mixed with gelatin-coated Cytodex-3 beads with<br>
a ratio of 40 cells per bead. Cells and beads (150-200 beads per well for 24-well plate) were<br>
suspended with 5 ml EBM + 15% normal human serum, mixed gently every hour for first 4<br>
hours, then left to culture in a CO2 incubator overnight. The next day, 10 ml of fresh EBM +<br>
5% HS were added, and the mixture was cultured for another 3 hours. Before experiments,<br>
the culture of EC-beads was checked; then 500 ul of PBS was added to a well of 24-well<br>
plate, and 100 ul of the EC-bead culture solution was added to the PBS. The number of<br>
beads was counted, and the concentration of EC/beads was calculated.<br>
A fibrinogen solution (1 mg/ml) in EBM medium with or without angiogenesis<br>
factors or testing factors was prepared. For positive control, 50 ng/ml VEGF + 25 ng/ml<br>
FGF2 was used. EC -beads were washed with EBM medium twice, and EC-beads were<br>
added to fibrinogen solution. The experiment was done in triplicate for each condition. The<br>
EC-beads were mixed gently in fibrinogen solution, and 2.5 ul human thrombin (0.05 U/ul)<br>
was added in 1 ml fibrinogen solution; 300 ul was immediately transfered to each well of a<br>
24-well plate. The fibrinogen solution polymerizes in 5-10 minutes; after 20 minutes, we<br>
added EBM + 20% normal human serum + 10 ug/ml aprotinin. The plate was incubated in a<br>
CC&gt;2 incubator. It takes about 24-48 hours for HDMEC to invade fibrin gel and form tubes.<br>
A micro-carrier in vitro angiogenesis assay previously designed to investigate<br>
bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell augiogenic behavior in bovine fibrin gels [Nehls<br>
and Drenckhahn, 1995a, b] was modified for the study of human microvascular endothelial<br>
cell angiogenesis in three-dimensional ECM environments (Figures 1 and 2). Briefly,<br>
human fibrinogen, isolated as previously described [Feng et al, 1999], was dissolved in<br>
Ml99 medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (pH 7.4) and sterilized by filtering through a<br>
0.22 micron filter. An isotonic 1.5 mg/ml collagen solution was prepared by mixing sterile<br>
Vitrogen 100 in 5X Ml 99 medium and distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 by IN<br>
NaOH. In certain experiments, growth factors and ECM proteins (such as VEGF, bFGF,<br>
PDGF-BB, serum, gelatin, and fibronectin) were added to the fibrinogen or collagen<br>
solutions. About 500 EC-beads were then added to the 1 mg/ml fibrinogen or 1.5 mg/ml<br>
collagen solutions. Subsequently, EC-beads-collagen or EC-beads—fibrinogen suspension<br>
(500 EC-beads/ml) was plated onto 24-well plates at 300 ul/well. EC-bead-collagen<br>
cultures were incubated at 37°C to form gel. The gelling of EC-bead-fibrin cultures<br>
occurred in less than 5 minutes at room temperature after the addition of thrombin to a final<br>
concentration of 0.5 U/ml. After gelation, 1 ml of fresh assay medium (EBM supplemented<br>
with 20% normal human serum for HDMEC or EBM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum was added to each well. The angiogenic response was monitored visually and<br>
recorded by video image capture. Specifically, capillary sprout formation was observed and<br>
recorded with a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted microscope (Nikon Inc.; Melville, NY),<br>
equipped with an incubator housing with a Nikon NP-2 thermostat and Sheldon #2004<br>
carbon dioxide flow mixer. The microscope was directly interfaced to a video system<br>
consisting of a Dage-MTI CCD-72S video camera and Sony 12" PVM-122 video monitor<br>
linked to a Macintosh G3 computer. The images were captured at various magnifications<br>
using Adobe Photoshop, The effect of angiogenic factors on sprout angiogenesis was<br>
quantified visually by determining the number and percent of EC-beads with capillary<br>
sprouts. One hundred beads (five to six random low power fields) in each of triplicate wells<br>
were counted for each experimental condition. All experiments were repeated at least three<br>
times.<br>
Cell culture.<br>
The African green monkey fibroblast cell line, CV-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), which<br>
lacks the nuclear receptor for thyroid hormone, was plated at 5000 cells/cm2 and maintained<br>
in DMEM, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100<br>
(j.g/ml streptomycin, and 2mM L-glutamine. All culture reagents were purchased from<br>
Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA). Cultures were maintained in a 37°C humidified<br>
chamber with 5% CC&gt;2. The medium was changed every three days and the cell lines were<br>
passaged at 80% confluency. For experimental treatment, cells were plated in 10-cm cell<br>
culture dishes (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) and allowed to grow for 24 h in 10%<br>
FBS-containing medium. The cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) and fed with serum-free DMEM supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and<br>
HEPES. After 48 h incubation in serum-free media, the cells were treated with a vehicle<br>
control (final concentration of 0.004 N KOH with 0.4% polyethyleneglycol [v/v]) or T4<br>
(10~7 M final concentration) for 30 min; media were then collected and free T4 levels were<br>
determined by enzyme immunoassays. Cultures incubated with 10"7 M total T4 have 10"9 to<br>
10"10 M free T4. Following treatment, the cells were harvested and the nuclear proteins<br>
prepared as previously described.<br>
Transient transfections with siRNA.<br>
CV-1 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (150,000 cells/dish) and incubated for 24 h<br>
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were rinsed in OPTI-MEM (Airibion,<br>
Austin, TX) and transfected with siRNA (100 nM final concentration) to aV, P3, or aV and<br>
P3 together using siPORT (Ambion) according to manufacturer's directions. Additional sets<br>
of CV-1 cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA, to serve as a negative control. Four<br>
hours post-transfection, 7 ml of 10% FBS-containing media was added to the dishes and the<br>
cultures were allowed to incubate overnight. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and<br>
placed in serum-free DMEM for 48 h before treatment with T4.<br>
RNA isolation and RT-PCR.<br>
Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures 72 h post- transfection using the RNeasy<br>
kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Two hundred nanograms<br>
of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega,<br>
Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's directions. Primers were based on published<br>
species-specific sequences: aV (accession number NM-002210) F-5'-<br>
TGGGATTGTGGAAGGAG and R-5'- AAATCCCTGTCCATCAGCAT (319 bp product),<br>
(33 (NM000212) F-S'-GTGTGAGTGCTCAGAGGAG andR-51-<br>
CTGACTCAATCTCGTCACGG (5 15 bp product), and GAPDH (AF261085) F-5'-<br>
GTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCT and R-5'- TGAGCTTGACMGTGGTCG (212 bp<br>
product), RT-PCR was performed in the Flexigene thermal cycler com TECHNE<br>
(Burlington, NJ). After a 2 min incubation at 95"C, 25 cycles of the following steps were<br>
performed: denaturation at 94'C for 1 min, annealing at 57'C for 1 min, and extension for 1<br>
min at 68°C for 25 cycles. The PCR products were visualized on a 1.8% (wlv) agarose gel<br>
stained with ethidium bromide.<br>
Western blotting.<br>
Aliquois of nuclear proteins (10 jag/lane) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer<br>
and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% resolving gel) and then transferred to nitrocellulose<br>
membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 1%<br>
Tween-20 (TBST) for 30 min, the membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a<br>
monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling Technology,<br>
Beverly, MA) in TBST with 5% milk overnight at 4°C. Following 3xlO-min washes in<br>
TBST, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000<br>
dilution) ftom DakoCytomation (Carpmteria, CA) in TBST with 5% milk for 1 h at room<br>
temperature- The membranes were washed 3x5 min in TBST and immunoreactive proteins<br>
were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Band intensity was determined<br>
using the VersaDoc 5000 Imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA),<br>
Radioligand binding assay.<br>
Two p,g of purified aVp3 was mixed with indicated concentrations of test<br>
compounds and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. [125I]-T4<br>
 (2 μCi) was then added and the mixture was allowed to incubate an additional 30 min at<br>
20°C. The samples were mixed with sample buffer (50% glycerol, 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8,<br>
and bromophenol blue) and runout on a 5% basic-native gel for 24 h at 45 mA in the cold.<br>
The apparatus was disassembled and the gels were placed on filter paper, wrapped in plastic<br>
wrap, and exposed to film. Band intensity was determined using the VersaDoc 5000<br>
Imaging system.<br>
Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (aVp3 studies).<br>
Ten-day-old chick embryos were purchased £tom SPAFAS (Preston, CT) and were<br>
incubated at 37°C with 55% relative humidity. A hypodermic needle was used to make a<br>
small hole in the blunt end of the egg and a second hole was made on the broad side of the<br>
egg, directly over an avascular portion of the embryonic membrane. Mild suction was<br>
applied to the first hole to displace the air sac and drop the CAM away from the shell. Using<br>
a Dremel model craft drill (Dremel, Racine, WI), a approx. 1.0 cm2 window was cut in the<br>
shell over the false air sac, allowing access to the CAM. Sterile disks of No.l filter paper<br>
(Whatman, Clifton, NJ) were pretreated with 3 mg/ml cortisone acetate and<br>
ImMmpropylthiouracil and air dried under sterile conditions. Thyroid hormone, control<br>
solvents, and the mAb LM609 were applied to the disks and subsequently dried. The disks<br>
were then suspended in PBS and placed on growing CAMS. After incubation for 3 days, the<br>
CAM beneath the filter disk was resected and rinsed with PBS. Each membrane was placed<br>
in a 35 mm Petri dish and examined under an SV6 stereo-microscope at SOX magnification.<br>
Digital images were captured and analyzed with Image-Pro software (Mediacybemetics).<br>
The number of vessel branch points contained in a circular region equal to the filter disk<br>
were counted. One image from each of 8-10 CAM preparations for each treatment condition<br>
was counted, and in addition each experiment was performed 3 times.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1. Effect of Thyroid Hormone on Angiogenesis: As seen in Figure 1A<br>
and summarized in Figure IB, both L-T4 and L-T3 enhanced angiogenesis in the CAM<br>
assay. T4, at a physiologic total concentration in the medium of 0.1 umol/L, increased blood<br>
vessel branch formation by 2.5-fold (P
2-fold. The possibility that T4 was only effective because of conversion of T4 to T3 by<br>
cellular 5'-monodeiodinase was ruled out by the finding that the deiodinase inhibitor PTU<br>
had no inhibitory effect on angiogenesis produced by T4. PTU was applied to all filter<br>
disks used in the CAM model. Thus, T4 and T3 promote new blood vessel branch formation<br>
in a CAM model that has been standardized previously for the assay of growth factors.<br>
Example 2. Effects of T4-Agarose and Tetrac: We have shown previously that<br>
T4-agarose stimulates cellular signal transduction pathways initiated at the plasma<br>
membrane in the same manner as T4 and that the actions of T4 and T4-agarose are blocked<br>
by a deaminated iodothyronine analogue, tetrac, which is known to inhibit binding of T4 to<br>
plasma membranes. In the CAM model, the addition of tetrac (0.1 umol/L) inhibited the<br>
action of T4 (Figure 2A), but tetrac alone had no effect on angiogenesis (Figure 2C). The<br>
action of T4-agarose, added at a hormone concentration of O.I umol/L, was comparable to<br>
that of T4 in the CAM model (Figure 2B), and the effect of T4-agarose was also inhibited<br>
by the action of tetrac (Figure 2B; summarized in 2C).<br>
Example 3. Enhancement of Proangiogenic Activity of FGF2 by a Submaximal<br>
Concentration of T4: Angiogenesis is a complex process that usually requires the<br>
participation of polypeptide growth factors. The CAM assay requires at least 48 hours for<br>
vessel growth to be manifest; thus, the apparent plasma membrane effects of thyroid<br>
hormone in this model are likely to result in a complex transcriptional response to the<br>
hormone. Therefore, we determined whether FGF2 was involved in the hormone response<br>
and whether the hormone might potentiate the effect of subphysiologic levels of this growth<br>
factor. T4 (0.05 umol/L) and FGF2 (0.5 ug/mL) individually stimulated angiogenesis to a<br>
modest degree (Figure 3). The angiogenic effect of this submaximal concentration of FGF2<br>
was enhanced by a subphysiologic concentration of T4 to the level caused by 1.0 ug FGF2<br>
alone. Thus, the effects of submaximal hormone and growth factor concentrations appear to<br>
be additive. To define more precisely the role of FGF2 in thyroid hormone stimulation of<br>
angiogenesis, a polyclonal antibody to FGF2 was added to the filters treated with either<br>
FGF2 or T4, and angiogenesis was measured after 72 hours. Figure 4 demonstrates that the<br>
FGF2 antibody inhibited angiogenesis stimulated either by FGF2 or by T4 in the absence of<br>
exogenous FGF2, suggesting that the T4 effect in the CAM assay was mediated by<br>
increased FGF2 expression. Control IgG antibody has no stimulatory or inhibitory effect in<br>
the CAM assay.<br>
Example 4. Stimulation of FGF2 Release From Endothelial Cells by Thyroid<br>
Hormone: Levels of FGF2 were measured in the media of ECV304 endothelial cells<br>
treated with either T4 (0.1 umol/L) or T3 (0.01 umol/L) for 3 days. As seen in the Table 2,<br>
T3 stimulated FGF2 concentration in the medium 3.6-fold, whereas T4 caused a 1.4-fold<br>
increase. This finding indicates that thyroid hormone may enhance the angiogenic effect of<br>
FGF2, at least in part, by increasing the concentration of growth factor available to<br>
endothelial cells.<br>

Example 5. Role of the ERK1/2 Signal Transduction Pathway in Stimulation of<br>
Angiogenesis by Thyroid Hormone and FGF2: A pathway by which T4 exerts a<br>
nongenomic effect on cells is the MAPK signal transduction cascade, specifically that of<br>
ERK1/2 activation. We know that T4 enhances ERK1/2 activation by epidermal growth<br>
factor. The role of the MAPK pathway in stimulation by thyroid hormone of FGF2<br>
expression was examined by the use of PD 98059 (2 to 20 umol/L), an inhibitor of ERK1/2<br>
activation by the tyrosine-threonine kinases MAPK kinase-1 (MEK1) and MEK2. The data<br>
in the Table demonstrate that PD 98059 effectively blocked the increase in FGF2 release<br>
from ECV304 endotbelial cells treated with either T4 or T3. Parallel studies of ERKl/2<br>
inhibition were performed in CAM assays, and representative results are shown in Figure 5.<br>
A combination of T3 and T4, each in physiologic concentrations, caused a 2.4-fold increase<br>
in blood vessel branching, an effect that was completely blocked by 3 umol/L PD 98059<br>
(Figure 5A), FGF2 stimulation of branch formation (2.2-fold) was also effectively blocked<br>
by this inhibitor of ERKl/2 activation (Figure 5B). Thus, the proangiogenic effect of<br>
thyroid hormone begins at the plasma membrane and involves activation of the ERKl/2<br>
pathway to promote FGF2 release from endothelial cells. ERKl/2 activation is again<br>
required to transduce the FGF2 signal and cause new blood vessel formation.<br>
Example 6. Action of Thyroid Hormone and FGF2 on MAPK Activation<br>
Stimulation of phosphorylation and nuclear translocadon of ERKl/2 MAPKs was studied in<br>
ECV304 cells treated with T4 (10~7 mol/L) for 15 minutes to 6 hours. The appearance of<br>
phosphorylated ERKl/2 in cell nuclei occurred within 15 minutes of T4 treatment, reached<br>
a maximal level at 30 minutes, and was still apparent at 6 hours (Figure 6A). This effect of<br>
the hormone was inhibited by PD 98059 (Figure 6B), a result to be expected because this<br>
compound blocks the phosphorylation of ERKl/2 by MAPK kinase. The traditional protein<br>
kinase C (PKC)-a, PKC-p, and PKC-y inhibitor CGP41251 also blocked the effect of the<br>
hormone on MAPK activation in these cells., as we have seen with T4 in other cell lines.<br>
Thyroid hormone enhances the action of several cytokines and growth factors, such as<br>
interferon- y!3 and epidermal growth factor. In ECV304 cells, T4 enhanced the MAPK<br>
activation caused by FGF2 in a 15-minute co incubation (Figure 6C). Applying<br>
observations made in ECV304 cells to the CAM model, we propose that the complex<br>
mechanism by which the hormone induces angiogenesis includes endothelial cell release of<br>
FGF2 and enhancement of the autocrine effect of released FGF2 on angiogenesis.<br>
Example 7. RT-PCR in ECV304 Cells Treated With Thyroid Hormone: The<br>
final question addressed in studies of the mechanism of the proangiogenic action of T4 was<br>
whether the hormone may induce FGF2 gene expression. Endothelial cells were treated<br>
with T4 (10"7 mol/L) for 6 to 48 hours, and RT-PCR-based estimates ofFGF2 and GAPDH<br>
KNA (inferred from cDNA measurements; Figure 7) were performed. Increase in<br>
abundance ofFGF2 cDNA, corrected for GAPDH content, was apparent by 6 hours of<br>
hormone treatment and was further enhanced by 48 hours.<br>
Example 8A. Retinal Neovascularization model in mice (diabetic and nondiabetic):<br>
To assess the pharmacologic activity of a test article on retinal<br>
neovascularization, Infant mice are exposed to a high oxygen environment for 7 days and<br>
allowed to recover, thereby stimulating the formation of new vessels on the retina. Test<br>
articles are evaluated to determine if retinal neovascularization is suppressed. The retinas<br>
are examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining and with at least one stain, which<br>
demonstrates neovascularization (usually a Selectin stain). Other stains (such as PCNA,<br>
PAS, GFAP, markers of angiogenesis, etc.) can be used. A summary of the model is below:<br>
Animal Model<br>
• Infant mice (P7) and their dams are placed in a hyper-oxygenated environment (70-<br>
80%) for 7 days.<br>
• On PI2, the mice are removed from the oxygenated environment and placed into a<br>
normal environment<br>
• Mice are allowed to recover for 5-7 days.<br>
• Mice are then sacrificed and the eyes collected.<br>
• Eyes are either frozen or fixed as appropriate<br>
• The eyes are stained with appropriate histochemical stains<br>
• The eyes are stained with appropriate immunohistochemical stains<br>
• Blood, serum, or other tissues can be collected<br>
• Eyes, with special reference to microvascular alterations, are examined for any and<br>
all findings. Neovascular growth will be semi quantitatively scored. Image analysis<br>
is also available.<br>
Example 8B: Thyroid Hormone and Diabetic Retinopathy<br>
A protocol disclosed in J de la Cruz et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 280:454-<br>
459,1997, is used for the administration of Tetrac to rats that have streptozotocin (STZ)-<br>
induced experimental diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. The endpoint is the inhibition by<br>
Tetrac of the appearance of proliferative retinopathy (angiogenesis).<br>
Example 9A. Wound Healing and Hemostatic Treatment Using Novel<br>
Pharmaceutical Polymeric Formulation of Thyroid Hormone and Analogs<br>
The present invention also includes a novel wound healing and hemostatic treatment<br>
that include an immobilized thyroid hormone analog, preferably T4 analogs, calcium<br>
chloride, and collagen. This novel formulation significantly controls both venous and<br>
arterial hemorrhage, reduces bleeding time, generates fibrin/platelet plug, releases plateletderived<br>
wound healing factors in a sustained manner in the presence of low level collagen,<br>
and safe. Development of such a wound healing and hemostatic dressing can be very<br>
valuable for short and long-term use in Combat Casualty Care. Pharmaceutical formulation<br>
of immobilized L-thyroxine (T4) and globular hexasaccharide in a hydrogel or dressing<br>
containing collagen and calcium chloride can be optimized. This novel Wound healing and<br>
Hemostatic (WH formulation) treatment in hydrogel or dressing can also include the<br>
addition of a microbicidal.<br>
L-thyroxine conjugated to polymer or Immobilized on agarose demonstrated potent<br>
stimulation of angiogenesis through activation of an adhesion cell surface receptor (integrin<br>
ocvj33) leading to activation of an intracellular signaling event, which in turn leads to upregulation<br>
of various growth factor productions. Additionaly, immobilized T4 induced<br>
epithelial, fibroblast, and keratinocyte cell migration. Immobilized T4, but not T3 or other<br>
analogs, enhanced collagen-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, which would<br>
promote formation of the subject's own platelet plug. Furthermore, immobilized T4 also<br>
promotes white blood cell migration, which could be critical for fighting infection. Hence,<br>
immobilized T4 can help the body make more of a compound used to regenerate damaged<br>
blood vessels, and it also increased the amount of white blood cells that makes free radicals<br>
in the wound site. Free radicals help clear potentially pathogenic bacteria from a wound.<br>
Thus, 14 or T4-agarose (10-100 nM), but not T3, DIPTA, or GC-1, is effective in<br>
enhancing platelet aggregation and secretion (de-granulation). Accordingly, T4 (or analogs<br>
and polymeric conjugations thereof, e.g., T4-agarose), in combination with 10 mM calcium<br>
chloride, and with or without collagen, is preferred for wound healing. See Figs. 23 A-E.<br>
THROMBOELASTOGRAPHY:<br>
Thromboelastography (TEG) has been used in various hospital settings since its<br>
development by Hartert in 1948. The principle of TEG is based on the measurement of the<br>
physical viscoelastic characteristics of blood clot. Clot formation was monitored at 37°C in<br>
an oscillating plastic cylindrical cuvette ("cup") and a coaxially suspended stationary piston<br>
("pin") with a 1 mm clearance between the surfaces, using a computerized<br>
Thrombelastograph (TEG Model 3000, Haemoscope, Skokie, IL). The cup oscillates in<br>
either direction every 4.5 seconds, with a 1 second mid-cycle stationary period; resulting in<br>
a frequency of 0.1 Hz and a maximal shear rate of 0.1 per second. The pin is suspended by<br>
a torsion wire that acts as a torque transducer. With clot formation, fibrin fibrils physically<br>
link the cup to the pin and the rotation of the cup as affected by the viscoelasticity of the<br>
clot (Transmitted to the pin) is displayed on-line using an IBM-compatible personal<br>
computer and customized software (Haemoscope Corp., Skokie, IL). The torque<br>
experienced by the pin (relative to the cup's oscillation) is plotted as a function of time.<br>
TEG assesses coagulation by measuring various parameters such as the time latency<br>
for the initial initiation of the clot (R), the time to initiation of a fixed clot firmness (k) of<br>
about 20 mm amplitude, the kinetic of clot development as measured by the angle (a), and<br>
the maximum amplitude of the clot (MA). The parameter A measures the width of the<br>
tracing at an)' point of the MA. Amplitude A in mm is a function of clot strength or<br>
elasticity. The amplitude on the TEG tracing is a measure of the rigidity of the clot; the<br>
peak strength or the shear elastic modulus attained by the clot, G, is a function of clot<br>
rigidity and can be calculated from the maximal amplitude (MA) of the TEG tracing.<br>
The following parameters were measured from the TEG tracing:<br>
R, the reaction time (gelation time) represents the latent period before the<br>
establishment of a 3-dimensional fibrin gel network (with measurable rigidity of<br>
about 2 mm amplitude).<br>
Maximum Amplitude (MA, in mm), is the peak rigidity manifested by the clot.<br>
Shear elastic modulus or clot strength (G, dynes/cm2 ) is defined by:<br>
G = (5000A)/(100-A).<br>
Blood clot firmness is an important parameter for in vivo thrombosis and<br>
hemostasis because the clot must stand the shear stress at the site of vascular injury, TEG<br>
can assess the efficacy of different pharmacological interventions on various factors<br>
(coagulation activation, thrombin generation, fibrin formation, platelet activation, plateletfibrin<br>
interaction, and fibrin polymerization) involved in clot formation and retraction. The<br>
effect of endotoxin (0.63 ug), Xa (0.25 nM), thrombin (0.3 mU), and TF (25 ng) on the<br>
different clot parameters measured by computerized TEG in human whole blood is shown<br>
in Table 3.<br>
Blood Sampling: Blood was drawn from consenting volunteers under a protocol<br>
approved by the Human Investigations Committee of William Beaumont Hospital. Using<br>
the two syringe method, samples were drawn through a 21 gauge butterfly needle and the<br>
initial 3 ml blood was discarded. Whole blood (WB) was collected into siliconized<br>
Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ containing 3.8% trisodium citrate such<br>
that a ratio of citrate whole blood of 1:9 (v/v) was maintained. TEG was performed within<br>
3 hrs of blood collection. Calcium was added back at 1-2.5 mM followed by the addition of<br>
the different stimulus. Calcium chloride by itself at the concentration used showed only a<br>
minimal effect on clot formation and clot strength.<br>
Clot formation is initiated by thrombin-induced cleavage of Fibrinopeptide A from<br>
fibrmogen. The resultant fibrin monomers spontaneously polymerize to form fibril strands<br>
that undergo linear extension, branching, and lateral association leading to the formation of<br>
a three-dimensional network of fibrin fibers. A unique property of network structures is<br>
that they behave as rigid elastic solids, capable of resisting deforming shear stress. This<br>
resistance to deformation can be measured by elastic modulus-an index of clot strength.<br>
Unlike conventional coagulation tests (like the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin<br>
time) that are based only on the time to the onset of clot formation, TEG allows acquisition<br>
of quantitative information allowing measurement of the maximal strength attained by<br>
clots. Via the GPIIb/TIIa receptor, platelets bind fibrin(ogen) and modulate the viscoelastic<br>
properties of clots. Our results demonstrated that clot strength in TF-TEG is clearly a<br>
function of platelet concentration and platelets augmented clot strength ~8 fold under shear.<br>
Different platelet GPIIb/nia antagonists (class I versus class II) behaved with distinct<br>
efficacy in inhibiting platelet-fibrin mediated clot strength using TF-TEG under shear.<br>

Platelet aggregation and de-granulation in whole blood using Impedance Technique:<br>
The Model 560 Whole-Blood Aggregometer and the associated Aggro-Link Software from<br>
the Chrono-Log Corporation were used in this study. Two electrodes are placed in diluted<br>
blood and an electrical impulse is sent from one to the other. As the platelets aggregate<br>
around the electrodes, the Chrono-Log measures the impedance of the electrical signal in<br>
ohms of resistance7.<br>
Blood Sampling:<br>
Whole blood was drawn daily from healthy donors between the ages of 17 and 21<br>
into 4.5 milliliter Vacutainer vials with 3.8% buffered sodium citrate (Becton Dickinson,<br>
Rutherford, New Jersey). The blood was kept on a rocker to extend the life of the platelets,<br>
and experiments were done within 5 hours of phlebotomy.<br>
Procedure: For the control, 500 microliters of whole blood, 500 microliters of 0.9% saline,<br>
and a magnetic stir bar were mixed into a cuvette, and heated for five minutes to 37 degrees<br>
Celsius. Sub-threshold aggregation was induced with 5 microliters of 1-2 tig/ml Collagen,<br>
which the Aggregometer measured for 6-7 minutes. The effects of T4, T4-agarose versus<br>
T3 and other thyroid hormone analogs on collagen-induced aggregation and secretion were<br>
tested. Ingerman-Wojenski C, Smith JB, Silver MJ. Evaluation of electrical aggregometry:<br>

Cell migration assay.<br>
Human granulocytes are isolated from shed blood by the method of Mousa et al. and<br>
cell migration assays carried out as previously described (Methods In Cell Science, 19 (3):<br>
179-187, 1997, and Methods In Cell Science 19 (3): 189-195,1997). Briefly, a neuroprobe<br>
96 well disposable chemotaxis chamber with an 8 ura pore size will be used. This chamber<br>
allow for quantitation of cellular migration towards a gradient of chemokme, cytokine or<br>
extracellular matrix proteins. Cell suspension (45 ul of 2 x 10°) will be added to a<br>
polypropylene plate containing 5 ill of test agents such as flavanoids or thyroid hormone<br>
derivatives and incubated for 10 minutes at 22 °C. IL8 (0.1 -100 ng) with or without T3/ T4<br>
(33 \i\) at 0.001 - 0.1 fiM will be added to the lower wells of a disposable chemotaxis<br>
chamber, then assemble the chamber using the pre-framed filter. Add 25 pi of cell / test<br>
agent suspension to the upper filter wells then incubate overnight (22 hours at 37 °C, 5%<br>
CO2) in a humidified cell culture incubator. After the overnight incubation, non-migrated<br>
cells and excess media will be gently removed using a 12 channel pipette and a cell scraper.<br>
The filters will then washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 1 %<br>
formaldehyde in PBS buffer. Membranes of migrated cells will be permeated with Triton X-<br>
100 (0.2 %) then washed 2-3 times with PBS. The actin filaments of migrated cells will be<br>
stained with Rhodamine phalloidin (12.8 lU/ml) for 30 minutes (22 °C). Rhodamine<br>
phalloidin will be made fresh weekly and reused for up to 3 days, when stored protected<br>
from light at 4°C. Chemotaxis will be quantitatively determined by fluorescence detection<br>
using a Cytofluor II micro-filter fluorimeter (530 excitation / 590 emission). All cell<br>
treatments and subsequent washings will be carried out using a uniquely designed<br>
treatment/wash station (Methods In Cell Science, 19 (3): 179-187,1997). This technique<br>
will allow for accurate quantitation of cell migration and provide reproducible results with<br>
minimal inter and iiitra assay variability.<br>
Cellular Migration assays:<br>
These assays were performed using a Neuroprobe 96 well disposable chemotaxis<br>
chamber with an 8 urn pore size. This chamber allowed for quantitation of cellular<br>
migration towards a gradient of either vitronectm or osteopontin. Cultured cells were<br>
removed following a standardized method using EDTA / Trypsin (0.01% / 0.025%).<br>
Following removal, the cells were washed twice and resuspended (2x10^ /ml) in EBM<br>
 (Endothelial cell basal media, Clonetics Inc.). Add either vitronectin or osteopontin (33 ui)<br>
at 0.0125 -100 jig/ml to the lower wells of a disposable chemotaxis chamber, and then<br>
assemble using the preframed filter. The cell suspension (45 ul) was added to a<br>
polypropylene plate containing 5 ul of test agent at different concentrations and incubated<br>
for 10 minutes at 22 °C. Add 25 ul of cell / test agent suspension to the upper filter wells<br>
then incubate overnight (22 hours at 37 °C) in a humidified cell culture incubator. After the<br>
overnight incubation, non-migrated cells and excess media were gently removed using a 12<br>
channel pipette and a cell scraper. The filters were then washed twice in PBS (no Ca+2 or<br>
Mg+2) and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Membranes of migrated cells were permeated<br>
with Triton X-l 00 (0.2 %) then washed 2-3 times with PBS. The actin filaments of<br>
migrated cells were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (12.8 lU/ml) for 30 minutes (22 °C).<br>
Rhodamine phalloidin was made fresh weekly and reused for up to 3 days, when stored<br>
protected from light at 4°C. Chemotaxis was quantitatively determined by fluorescence<br>
detection using a Cytofluor II (530 excitation / 590 emission). All cell treatment and<br>
subsequent washings were carried out using a uniquely designed treatment/wash station.<br>
This station consisted of six individual reagent units each with a 30 ml volume capacity.<br>
Individual units were filled with one of the following reagents: PBS, formaldehyde, Triton<br>
X-l00, or rhodamine-phalloidin. Using this technique, filters were gently dipped into the<br>
appropriate solution, thus minimizing migrated cell loss. This technique allowed for<br>
maximum quantitation of cell migration and provided reproducible results with minimal<br>
inter and intra assay variability (1,2).<br>

In vivo wound healing in diabetic rats:<br>
Using an acute incision wound model in diabetic rats, the effects of thyroid hormone<br>
analogs and its conjugated fonns are tested. The rate of wound closure, breaking strength<br>
analyses and histology are performed periodically on days 3-21.<br>
Methods:<br>
Animals (Mice and Rats) in the study are given two small puncture wounds - WH is<br>
applied to one of the wounds, and the other was covered with saline solution as a control.<br>
Otherwise, the wounds are left to heal naturally.<br>
The animals are euthanised five days after they are wounded. A small area of skin -<br>
1 to 1.5 millimetres - is excised from the edges of the treated and untreated wounds.<br>
Wound closure and time to wound closure is determined. Additionally, the levels of<br>
tenascin, a protein that helps build connective tissue, in the granulation tissue of the wounds<br>
is determined. The quality of the granulation tissue (i.e. rough., pinkish tissue that normally<br>
forms as a wound heals, new capillaries and connective tissue) is also determined.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Chronic granulating wounds are prepared by methods well known in the art. Male<br>
Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 grams are acclimatized for a week in our facility<br>
prior to use. Under intraperitoneal Nembutal anesthesia (SSmg/kg), the rat dorsum is shaved<br>
and depilated. Animals are individually caged and given food and water ad libitum. All<br>
experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee<br>
guidelines of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Albany, NY.<br>
Histological characterization of this wound with comparison to a human chronic<br>
granulating wound had previously been performed. Sixty four rats are then divided into<br>
eight treatment groups (n=8 / group). Animals are treated with topical application of vehicle<br>
(vehicle controls) on days 5, 9, 12,15, and 18. The vehicle control can be either agarose<br>
(Group 1) or the polymeric form (Group 2) that will be used in conjugation of L-thyroxine.<br>
Wounds treated with T4-agarose (Groups 3-5) or T4-polymer (Groups 6-8) at 1, 10,100<br>
ug/cm2 in the presence of 10 ug globular hexasaccharide, 10 ug collagen, and 10 mM<br>
calcium chloride to be applied topically on days 5, 9,12,15, and 18. All wounds are left<br>
exposed. Every 48 hours the outlines of the wounds can be traced onto acetate sheets, and<br>
area calculations can be performed using computerized digital planimetry.<br>
Three full-thickness, transverse strips of granulation tissue are then harvested from<br>
the cephalad, middle, and caudal ends of the wounds on day 19 and fixed in 10-percent<br>
buffered formalin. Transverse sections (Sum) are taken from each specimen and stained<br>
with hematoxylin and eosin. The thickness of the granulation tissue can be estimated with<br>
an ocular micrometer at low power. High-powered fields are examined immediately below<br>
the superficial inflammatory layer of the granulation tissue. From each strip of granulation<br>
tissue five adjacent high-powered fields can be photographed and coded. Enlarged prints of<br>
these exposures are then used for histometric analysis in a blinded fashion. Fibroblasts,<br>
"round" cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils), and capillaries are counted. In<br>
addition the cellularity of each section is graded for cellularity on a scale of 1 (reduced cell<br>
counts) to 5 (highly cellular).<br>
Statistical analysis:<br>
Serial area measurements were plotted against time. For each animal's data a<br>
Gompertz equation will be fitted (typical r 2=0.85). Using this curve the wound half-life<br>
can be estimated. Comparison between groups is performed using life table analysis and the<br>
Wilcoxon rank test. These statistical analyses are performed using the SAS (SAS/STAT<br>
Guide for Personal Computers, Version 6 Edition, Gary, North Carolina, 1987, p 1028) and<br>
BMDP (BMDP Statistical Software Manual, Los Angeles, BMDP Statistical Software, Inc.<br>
1988) packages on a personal computer.<br>
Cell counts for the different treatment groups are pooled and analyzed using a oneway<br>
analysis of variance. Post-hoc analyses of differences between groups can be carried<br>
out using Tukey's test (all pairwise multiple-comparison test) with/? 
significant. Sigma Stat statistical software (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, California) will<br>
be used for data analysis.<br>
Example 10. Rodent Model of Myocardial Infarction: The coronary artery<br>
ligation model of myocardial infarction is used to investigate cardiac function in rats. The<br>
rat is initially anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine, and after appropriate anesthesia is<br>
obtained, the trachea is intubated and positive pressure ventilation is initiated. The animal<br>
is placed supine with its extremities loosely taped and a median sternotomy is performed.<br>
The heart is gently exteriorized and a 6-O suture is firmly tied around the left anterior<br>
descending coronary artery. The heart is rapidly replaced in the chest and the thoracotomy<br>
incision is closed with a 3-O purse string suture followed by skin closure with interrupted<br>
sutures or surgical clips. Animals are placed on a temperature regulated heating pad and<br>
closely observed during recovery. Supplemental oxygen and cardiopulmonary resuscitation<br>
are administered if necessary. After recovery, the rat is returned to the animal care facility.<br>
Such coronary artery ligation in the rat produces large anterior wall myocardial infarctions.<br>
The 48 hr. mortality for this procedure can be as high as 50%, and there is variability in the<br>
size of the infarct produced by this procedure. Based on these considerations, and prior<br>
experience, to obtain 16-20 rats with large infarcts so that the two models of thyroid<br>
hormone delivery discussed below can be compared, approximately 400 rats are required.<br>
These experiments are designed to show that systemic administration of thyroid<br>
hormone either before or after coronary artery ligation leads to beneficial effects in intact<br>
animals, including the extent of hemodynamic abnormalities assessed by echocardiography<br>
and hemodynamic measurements, and reduction of infarct size. Outcome measurements are<br>
proposed at three weeks post-infarction. Although some rats may have no infarction, or<br>
only a small infarction is produced, these rats can be identified by normal echocardiograms<br>
and normal hemodynamics (LV end-diastolic pressure 
Thyroid Hormone Delivery<br>
There are two delivery approaches. In the first, thyroid hormone is directly injected<br>
into the peri-infarct myocardium. As the demarcation between normal and ischemic<br>
myocardium is easily identified during the acute open chest occlusion, this approach<br>
provides sufficient delivery of hormone to detect angiogenic effects.<br>
Although the first model is useful in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass<br>
surgery, and constitutes proof of principle that one local injection induces angiogenesis, a<br>
broader approach using a second model can also be used. In the second model, a catheter<br>
retrograde is placed into the left ventricle via a carotid artery in the anesthetized rat prior to<br>
inducing niyocardial infarction. Alternatively, a direct needle puncture of the aorta, just<br>
above the aortic valve, is performed. The intracoronary injection of the thyroid hormone is<br>
then simulated by abruptly occluding the aorta above the origin of the coronary vessels for<br>
several seconds, thereby producing isovolumic contractions. Thyroid hormone is then<br>
injected into the left ventricle or aorta immediately after aortic constriction. The resulting<br>
isovolumic contractions propel blood down the coronary vessels perfusing the entire<br>
myocardium with thyroid hormone. This procedure can be done as many times as necessary<br>
to achieve effectiveness. The number of injections depends on the doses used and the<br>
formation of new blood vessels.<br>
Echocardiographv:<br>
A method for obtaining 2-D and M-mode echocardiograms in unanesthetized rats<br>
has been developed. Left ventricular dimensions, function, wall thickness and wall motion<br>
can be reproducibly and reliably measured. The measurement are carried out in a blinded<br>
fashion to eliminate bias with respect to thyroid hormone administration.<br>
Hemodvnainics:<br>
Hemodynamic measurements are used to determine the degree of left ventricular<br>
impairment. Rats are anesthetized with isoflurane. Through an incision along the right<br>
anterior neck, the right carotid artery and the right jugular vein are isolated and cannulated<br>
with a pressure transducing catheter (Millar, SPR-612, 1.2 Fr). The following<br>
measurements are then made: heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure,<br>
left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, and + and -dP/dt. Of particular utility<br>
are measurements of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, progressive elevation of which<br>
correlates with the degree of myocardial damage.<br>
Infarct Size:<br>
Rats are sacrificed for measurement of infarct size using TTC methodology.<br>
Morphometry<br>
Microvessel density [microvessels/mm2] will be measured in the infarct area, periinfarct<br>
area, and in the spared myocardium opposing the infarction, usually the posterior<br>
wall. From each rat, 7-10 microscopic high power fields [x400] with transversely sectioned<br>
myocytes will be digitally recorded using Image Analysis software. Micro vessels will be<br>
counted by a blinded investigator. The microcirculation will be defined as vessels beyond<br>
third order arterioles with a diameter of 150 micrometers or less, supplying tissue between<br>
arterioles and venules. To correct for differences in left ventricular hypertrophy,<br>
microvessel density will be divided by LV weight corrected for body weight. Myocardium<br>
from sham operated rats will serves as controls.<br>
Example 11: Effects of the aVp3 antagonists on the pro-angiogenesis effect of<br>
T4 or FGF2: The aV(33 inhibitor LM609 totally inhibited both FGF2 or T4-induced proangiogenic<br>
effects in the CAM model at 10 micrograms (Figure 16).<br>
Example 12: Inhibition of Cancer-Related New Blood Vessel Growth.<br>
A protocol disclosed in J. Bennett, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99:2211-2215, 2002, is<br>
used for the administration of tetraiodothyroacetic (Tetrac) to SCID mice that have received<br>
implants of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Tetrac is provided in drinking water to<br>
raise the circulating level of the hormone analog in the mouse model to 10" M. The<br>
endpoint is the inhibitory action of tetrac on angiogenesis about the implanted tumors.<br>
Example 13: Pro-angiogenesis Promoting Effect of Thyroid Hormone and<br>
Analogs Thereof at Subthreshold Levels of VEGF and FGF2 in an in vitro<br>
Three-dimensional Micro-vascular Endothelial Sprouting Model<br>
Either T3, T,t, T4-agarose, or fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) plus vascular endothelial<br>
growth factor (VEGF) produced a comparable pro-angiogenesis effect in the in vitro threedimensional<br>
micro-vascular endothelial sprouting model. The pro-angiogenesis effect of the<br>
thyroid hormone analogs were blocked by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated<br>
protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) signal transduction cascade. Additionally, a specific avps<br>
integrin antagonist (XT199) inhibited the pro-angiogenesis effect of either thyroid hormone<br>
analogs or T4-agarose. Data also demonstrated that the thyroid hormone antagonist Tetrac<br>
inhibits the thyroid analog's pro-angiogenesis response. Thus, those thyroid hormone analogs<br>
tested are pro-angiogenic, an action that is initiated at the plasma membrane and involves avp3<br>
integrin receptors, and is MAPK-dependent.<br>
The present invention describes a pro-angiogenesis promoting effect of T3, T4, or T4-<br>
agarose at sub-threshold levels of VEGF and FGF2 in an in vitro three-dimensional microvascular<br>
endothelial sprouting model. The invention also provides evidence that the hormone<br>
effect is initiated at the endothelial cell plasma membrane and is mediated by activation of the<br>
ocvpS integrin and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway.<br>
Enhancement by T3, T4, or Tt-agarose of the angiogenesis activity of low<br>
concentrations of VEGF and FGF2 in the three-dimensional sprouting assay was<br>
demonstrated. Either T3 T4 at 10~7-10~8 M, or T4-agarose at 10~7 M total hormone<br>
concentration was comparable in pro- angiogenesis activity to the maximal concentrations<br>
of VEGF and FGF2 effect in this in vitro model. Although new blood vessel growth in the<br>
rat heart has been reported to occur concomitantly with induction of myocardial<br>
hypertrophy by a high dose of T4, thyroid hormone has not been regarded as an angiogenic<br>
factor. The present example establishes that the hormone in physiologic concentrations is<br>
pro-angiogenic in a setting other than the heart.<br>
T4-agarose reproduced the effects of T4, and this derivative of thyroid hormone is<br>
thought not to gain entry to the cell interior, it has been used in our laboratory to examine<br>
models of hormone action for possible cell surface-initiated actions of iodothyronines.<br>
Further, experiments carried out with T4 and tetrac also supported the conclusion that the<br>
action of T4 in this model was initiated at the plasma membrane. Tetrac blocks membraneinitiated<br>
effects of T4.<br>
Since thyroid hormone non-genomically activates the MAPK (ERK1/2) signal<br>
transduction pathway, the action of the hormone on angiogenesis can be MAPK-mediated.<br>
When added to the CAM model, an inhibitor of the MAPK cascade, PD 98059, inhibited<br>
the pro-angiogenic action of T4. While this result was consistent with an action on<br>
transduction of the thyroid hormone signal upstream of an effect of T4 on FGF2 elaboration,<br>
it is known that FGF2 also acts via an MAPK-dependent mechanism. T4 and FGF2<br>
individually cause phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells<br>
and, when used in sub-maximal doses, combine to enhance ERK1/2 activation further. To<br>
examine the possibility that the only MAPK-dependent component of hormonal stimulation<br>
of angiogenesis related exclusively to the action of FGF2 on vessel growth, cellular release<br>
of FGF2 in response to T4 in the presence of PD 98059 was measured. The latter agent<br>
blocked the hormone-induced increase in growth factor concentration and indicated that<br>
MAPK activation was involved in the action of T4 on FGF2 release from endothelial cells,<br>
as well as the consequent effect of FGF2 on angiogenesis.<br>
Effect of Thyroid Hormone on Angiogenesis<br>
Either T4, T3, or T4-agarose at 0.01-0.1 joM resulted in significant (P 
stimulation of angiogenesis (Table 4). This is shown to be comparable to the proangiogenesis<br>
efficacy of FGF2 (50 ng/ml) plus VEGF (25 ng/ml).<br>

Data (means +SD) were obtained from 3 experiments. Cells were pre-treated with Subthreshold<br>
level ofFGF2 (1.25 ng/ml) + VEGF(2.5 ng/ml).<br>
Data represent mean ± SD, n = 3, *P 
Effects of Tetrac on thyroid pro-angiogenesis action:<br>
Ta stimulates cellular signal transduction pathways initiated at the plasma<br>
membrane. These pro-angiogenesis actions are blocked by a deaminated iodothyronine<br>
analogue, tetrac, which is known to inhibit binding of T4 to plasma membranes. The<br>
addition of tetrac (0.1μ.M) inhibited the pro-angiogenesis action of either T3, T4, or T4-<br>
agarose (Tables 5-7). This is shown by the inhibition of number of micr-vascular<br>
endothelial cell migration and vessel length (Table 5-7).<br>
Role of the ERK1/2 Signal Transduction Pathway in Stimulation of<br>
Angiogenesis by Thyroid Hormone:<br>
Parallel studies of ERK1/2 inhibition were carried out in the three-dimensional<br>
micro-vascular sprouting assays. Thyroid hormone and analog at 0.01-0.1 uM caused<br>
significant increase in tube length and number of migrating cells, an effect that was<br>
significantly ( P 
of number micro-vascular endothelial cell migration and vessel length (Table 5-7).<br>
Role of the Integrin avp3 in Stimulation of Angiogenesis by Thyroid Hormone:<br>
Either Ta, T4, or T4-agarose at 0.01-0.1 pM-mediated pro-angiogenesis in the<br>
presence of sub-threshold levels of VEGF and FGF2 was significantly (P 
by the avp3 integrin antagonist XT199 (Tables 5-7) . This is shown by the inhibition of<br>
number of micro-vascular endothelial cell migration and vessel length (Table 5-7).<br>
Thus, the pro-angiogenesis effect of thyroid hormone and its analogs begins at the<br>
plasma membrane av|33 integrin and involves activation of the ERK1/2.<br>

Example 14: In vitro Model for Evaluating Polymeric Thyroid Analogs<br>
Transport Across the Blood-Brain Barrier<br>
Described below is an in vitro method for evaluating the facility with which selected<br>
polymeric thyroid analog alone or in combination with nerve growth factor or other<br>
neurogenesis factors likely will pass across the blood-brain barrier. A detailed description of<br>
the model and protocol are provided by Audus, et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci 507: 9-18<br>
(1987), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Briefly, microvessel endothelial cells are isolated from the cerebral gray matter of<br>
fresh bovine brains. Brains are obtained from a local slaughter house and transported to the<br>
laboratory in ice cold minimum essential medium ("MEM") with antibiotics. Under sterile<br>
conditions the large surface blood vessels and meninges are removed using standard<br>
dissection procedures. The cortical gray matter is removed by aspiration, then minced into<br>
cubes of about 1 mm. The minced gray matter then is incubated with 0.5% dispase (BMB,<br>
Indianapolis, Ind.) for 3 hours at 37°C. in a shaking water bath. Following the 3 hour<br>
digestion, the mixture is concentrated by centrifugation (lOOOx g for 10 min.), then<br>
resuspended in 13% dextran and centrifuged for 10 min. at 5800x g. Supernatant fat, cell<br>
debris and myelin are discarded and the crude microvessel pellet resuspended in 1 mg/ml<br>
collagenase/dispase and incubated in a shaking water bath for 5 hours at 37°C. After the 5-<br>
hour digestion, the microvessel suspension is applied to a pre-established 50% Percoll<br>
gradient and centriruged for 10 rain at lOOOx g. The band containing purified endothelial<br>
cells (second band from the top of the gradient) is removed and washed two times with<br>
culture medium (e.g., 50% MEM750% F-12 nutrient mix). The cells are frozen (-80° C.) in<br>
medium containing 20% DMSO and 10% horse serum for later use.<br>
After isolation, approximately 5xl05 cells/cm2 are plated on culture dishes or 5-12<br>
mm pore size polycarbonate filters that are coated with rat collagen and fibronectin. 10-12<br>
days after seeding the cells, cell monolayers are inspected for confluency by microscopy.<br>
Characterization of the morphological, histochemical and biochemical properties of<br>
these cells has shown that these cells possess many of the salient features of the blood-brain<br>
barrier. These features include: tight intercellular junctions, lack of membrane fenestrations,<br>
low levels of pinocytotic activity, and the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase,<br>
alkaline phosphatase, and Factor VIII antigen activities.<br>
The cultured cells can be used in a wide variety of experiments where a model for<br>
polarized binding or transport is required. By plating the cells in multi-well plates, receptor<br>
and non-receptor binding of both large and small molecules can be conducted. In order to<br>
conduct transendothelial cell flux measurements, the cells are grown on porous<br>
polycarbonate membrane filters (e.g., from Nucleopore, Pleasanton, Calif.). Large pore size<br>
filters (5-12 mm) are used to avoid the possibility of the filter becoming the rate-limiting<br>
barrier to molecular flux. The use of these large-pore filters does not permit cell growth<br>
under the filter and allows visual inspection of the cell monolayer.<br>
Once the cells reach confluency, they are placed in a side-by-side diffusion cell<br>
apparatus (e.g., from Crown Glass, Sommerville, N.J.). For flux measurements, the donor<br>
chamber of the diffusion cell is pulsed with a test substance, then at various times following<br>
the pulse, an aliquot is removed from the receiver chamber for analysis. Radioactive or<br>
fluorescently-labelled substances permit reliable quantitation of molecular flux. Monolayer<br>
integrity is simultaneously measured by the addition of a non-transportable test substance<br>
such as sucrose or inulin and replicates of at least 4 determinations are measured in order to<br>
ensure statistical significance.<br>
Example 15: Traumatic Injury Model<br>
The fluid percussion brain injury model was used to assess the ability of polymeric<br>
thyroid hormone analogs alone or in combination with nerve growth factors or other<br>
neurogenesis factors to restore central nervous system functions following significant<br>
traumatic brain nrj ury.<br>
/. Fluid Percussion Brain Injury Procedure<br>
The animals used in this study were male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300<br>
grams (Charles River). The basic surgical preparation for the fluid-percussion brain injury<br>
has been previously described. Dietrich, etal., ActaNeuropathol. 87: 250-258 (1994)<br>
incorporated by reference herein. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 3% halothane, 30%<br>
oxygen, and a balance of nitrous oxide. Tracheal intubation was performed and rats were<br>
placed in a stereotaxic frame. A 4,8-rnm craniotomy was then made overlying the right<br>
parietal cortex, 3.8 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm lateral to the midline. An injury<br>
tube was placed over the exposed dura and bonded by adhesive. Dental acrylic was then<br>
poured around the injury tube and the injury tube was then plugged with a gelfoam sponge.<br>
The scalp was sutured closed and the animal returned to its home case and allowed to<br>
recover overnight.<br>
On the next day, fluid-percussion brain injury was produced essentially as described<br>
by Dixon, et al,5 J. Neurosurg. 67: 110-119 (1987) and Clifton, et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow<br>
Metab. 11: 114-121 (1991). The fluid percussion device consisted of a saline-filled<br>
Plexiglas cylinder that is fitted with a transducer housing and injury screw adapted for the<br>
rat's skull. The metal screw was firmly connected to the plastic injury rube of the intubated<br>
anesthetized rat (70% nitrous oxide, 1.5% halothane, and 30% oxygen), and the injury was<br>
induced by the descent of a pendulum that strikes the piston. Rats underwent mild-tomoderate<br>
head injury, ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 arm. Brain temperature was indirectly<br>
monitored with a thermistor probe inserted into the right temporalis muscle and maintained<br>
at 37-37.5°C. Rectal temperature was also measured and maintained at 37°C. prior to and<br>
throughout the monitoring period.<br>
Behavioral Testing.<br>
Three standard functiona/ehavioral tests were used to assess sensorimotor and<br>
reflex function after brain injury. The tests have been fully described in the literature,<br>
including Bederson, et al., (1986) Stroke 17: 472-476; DeRyck, et al., (1992) Brain Res.<br>
573: 44-60; Markgraf, et al., (1992) Brain Res. 575: 238-246; and Alexis, et al., (1995)<br>
Stroke 26: 2338-2346.<br>
A. The Forelimb Placing Test<br>
Forelimb placing to three separate stimuli (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive) was<br>
measured to assess sensorimotor integration. DeRyck, et al., Brain Res. 573:44-60 (1992).<br>
For the visual placing subtest, the animal is held upright by the researcher and brought close<br>
to a table top. Normal placing of the limb on the table is scored as "0," delayed placing (
sec) is scored as "1," and no or very delayed placing (&gt;2 sec) is scored as "2." Separate<br>
scores are obtained first as the animal is brought forward and then again as the animal is<br>
brought sideways to the table (maximum score per limb=4; in each case higher numbers<br>
denote greater deficits). For the tactile placing subtest, the animal is held so that it cannot<br>
see or touch the table top with its whiskers. The dorsal forepaw is touched lightly to the<br>
table top as the animal is first brought forward and then brought sideways to the table.<br>
Placing each time is scored as above (maximum score per limb=4). For the proprioceptive<br>
placing subtest, the animal is brought forward only and greater pressure is applied to the<br>
dorsal forepaw; placing is scored as above (maximum score per limb=2). Finally, the ability<br>
of animals to place the forelimb in response to whisker stimulation by the tabletop was<br>
tested (maximum score per limb=2). Then subscores were added to give the total forelimb<br>
placing score per limb (range=0-12).<br>
B. The Beam Balance Test<br>
Beam balance is sensitive to motor cortical insults. This task was used to assess<br>
gross vestibulomotor function by requiring a rat to balance steadily on a narrow beam.<br>
Feeney, etal., Science, 217: 855-857 (1982); Goldstein, etal., Behav. Neurosci. 104: 318-<br>
325 (1990). The test involved three 60-second training trials 24 hours before surgery to<br>
acquire baseline data. The apparatus consisted of a 3/4-inch-wide beam, 10 inches in length,<br>
suspended 1 ft. above a table top. The rat was positioned on the beam and had to maintain<br>
steady posture with all limbs on top of the beam for 60 seconds. The animals' performance<br>
was rated with the scale of Clifton, et al., J. Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 11:1114-121 (1991),<br>
which ranges from 1 to 6, with a score of 1 being normal and a score of 6 indicating that the<br>
animal was unable to support itself on the beam.<br>
C. The Beam Walking Test<br>
This was a test of sensorimotor integration specifically examining hindlimb<br>
function. The testing apparatus and rating procedures were adapted from Feeney, et al.,<br>
Science, 217: 855-857 (1982). A 1-inch-wide beam, 4 ft. in length, was suspended 3 ft.<br>
above the floor in a dimly lit room. At the far end of the beam was a darkened goal box with<br>
a narrow entryway. At equal distances along the beam, four 3-inch metal screws were<br>
positioned, angling away from the beam's center. A white noise generator and bright light<br>
source at the start of the beam motivated the animal to traverse the beam and enter the goal<br>
box. Once inside the goal box, the stimuli were terminated. The rat's latency to reach the<br>
goal box (in seconds) and hindlimb performance as it traversed the beam (based on a 1 to 7<br>
rating scale) were recorded. A score of 7 indicates normal beam walking with less than 2<br>
foot slips, and a score of 1 indicates that the rat was unable to traverse the beam in less than<br>
80 seconds. Each rat was trained for three days before surgery to acquire the task and to<br>
achieve normal performance (a score of 7) on three consecutive trials. Three baseline trials<br>
were collected 24 hours before surgery, and three testing trials were recorded daily<br>
thereafter. Mean values of latency and score for each day were computed.<br>

for the preparation ot 4-rluoro-.sup. 18 F-benzyl halides is described in Iwata et al., Applied<br>
Radiation and Isotopes (2000), Vol. 52, pp. 87-92.<br>
Example 22: Preparation of Compounds for SPECT-imaging<br>
For Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ("SPECT"), 99mTc-labeled<br>
compounds are preferred. A general synthetic pathway for these compounds starts with<br>
non-radioactive analogues of compounds according to Examples 16-20 that are reacted with<br>
99mTc -binding chelators, e.g. Nj 82 -Chelators. The synthesis of the chelators follows<br>
standard procedures, for example, the procedures described in A. Mahmood et al., A N2 82 -<br>
Tetradentate Chelate for Solid-Phase Synthesis: Tecnnetium, Rhenium in Chemistry and<br>
Nuclear Medicine (1999), Vol. 5, p. 71, or in Z. P. Zhuang et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry<br>
(1999), Vol. 10, p. 159.<br>
One of the chelators is either bound directly to the nitrogen in the ~N(R4)R5 group<br>
of the non-radioactive compounds according to Examples 16-20, or via a linker moiety<br>
comprising an alkyl radical having one to ten carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl radical<br>
optionally contains one to ten --C(O)— groups, one to ten — C(O)N(R)~ groups, one to ten —<br>
N(R)C(O)— groups, one to ten —N(R)~ groups, one to ten ~N(R)o groups, one to ten<br>
hydroxy groups, one to ten —C(O)OR~ groups, one to ten oxygen atoms, one to ten sulfur<br>
atoms, one to ten nitrogen atoms, one to ten halogen atoms, one to ten aiyl groups, and one<br>
to ten saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic rings wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl. A<br>
preferred linker moiety is -C(0)-CH2 --N(H)-.<br>
Example 23: T4 is a ligand of aVp3 integrin<br>
To determine if T4 is a ligand of the aVp3 integrin, 2 u.g of commercially available<br>
purified protein was incubated with [125I]T4, and the mixture was run out on a nondenaturing<br>
polyacrylamide gel. aVp3 binds radiolabeled T4 and this interaction was<br>
competitively disrupted by unlabeled T4, which was added to aVp3 prior to the [I25I]T4<br>
incubation, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 24). Addition of unlabeled T4<br>
reduced binding of integrin to the radiolabeled ligand by 13% at a total T4 concentration of<br>
10"7 M total (3x10"10 M free T4), 58% at 10'6 M total (1.6xlO~9 M free), and inhibition of<br>
binding was maximal with 10"5 M unlabeled T4. Using non-linear regression, the interaction<br>
of aVp3 with free T4 was determined to have a Kd of 333 pM and an ECso of 371 pM.<br>
Unlabeled '13 was less etlective in displacing [I25I]T4-binding to aVp3, reducing the signal<br>
by28%atlO-4MtolalT3.<br>
Example 24: T4 binding to ocVpS is blocked by tetrac, RGD peptide and<br>
integrin antibody<br>
We have shown previously that T4-stimulated signaling pathways activated at the<br>
cell surface can be inhibited by the iodothyronine analog tetrac, which is hown to prevent<br>
binding of T4 to the plasma membrane. In our radioligand-binding assay, while 10~8 M<br>
tetrac had no effect on [I25I]T4-binding to purified aVp3, the association of T4 and ocVp3<br>
was reduced by 38% in the presence of 1CT7 M tetrac and by 90% with 10~5 M tetrac (Fig.<br>
25). To determine specificity of the interaction, an RGD peptide, which binds to the<br>
extracellular matrix-biding site on ccV(33, and an RGB peptide, which has a glutamic acid<br>
residue instead of an aspartic acid residue and thus does not bind aV|33, were added in an<br>
attempt to displace T4 from binding with the integrin. Application of an RGD peptide, but<br>
not an RGB peptide, reduced the interaction of [12SI]T4 with ocVp3 in a dose-dependent<br>
manner (Fig. 25).<br>
To further characterize the interaction of T4 with aVp3, antibodies to ctVp3 or<br>
ctVpS were added to purified aVp3 prior to addition of [125I]T4. Addition of 1 p.g/ml of<br>
aVp3 monoclonal antibody LM609 reduced complex formation between the integrin and<br>
T4 by 52%, compared to untreated control samples. Increasing the amount of LM609 to 2<br>
Hg, 4 p.g, and 8 |J,g/ml diminished band intensity by 64%, 63% and 81%, respectively (Fig.<br>
26). Similar results were observed when a different aVp3 monoclonal antibody, SC7312,<br>
was incubated with the integrin. SC7312 reduced the ability of T4 to bind ocVp3 by 20%<br>
with 1 p.g/ml of antibody present, 46% with 2 u.g, 47% with 4 p,g, and by 59% when 8<br>
p.g/ml of antibody were present. Incubation with monoclonal antibodies to aV and P3,<br>
separately, did not affect [125I]T4-binding to aVp3, suggesting that the association requires<br>
the binding pocket generated from the heterodimeric complex of aVp3 and not necessarily<br>
a specific region on either monomer. To verify that the reduction in band intensity was due<br>
to specific recognition of aVp3 by antibodies, purified aVp3 was incubated with a<br>
monoclonal antibody to aVp5 (PIF6) or mouse IgG prior to addition of [125I]T4, neither of<br>
which influenced complex formation between the integrin and radioligand (Fig. 26).<br>
Example 25: T4-stimulated MAPK activation is blocked by inhibitors of<br>
hormone binding and of integrin aVp3<br>
Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated MAPK (pERKl/2) was studied in CV-1<br>
cells treated with physiological levels of T4 10"7 M total hormone concentration, 10"10 M<br>
free hormone) for 30 min. Consistent with results we have previously reported, T4 induced<br>
nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated MAPK in CV-1 cells within 30 min (Fig. 27). Preincubation<br>
of CV-1 cells with the indicated concentrations of ctVp3 antagonists for 16 h<br>
reduced the ability of T4 to induce MAPK activation and translocation. Application of an<br>
RGD peptide at 10 8 and 10"7 M had a minimal effect on MAPK activation. However, 10"6<br>
M RGD peptide inhibited MAPK phosphorylation by 62% compared to control cultures and<br>
activation was reduced maximally when 10~5 M RGD (85% reduction) and KT4 M RGD<br>
(87% reduction) were present in the culture media. Addition of the nonspecific RGB peptide<br>
to the culture media had no effect on MAPK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation<br>
following T4 treatment in CV-1 cells.<br>
Tetrac, which prevents the binding of T4 to the plasma membrane, is an effective<br>
inhibitor of T4-induced MAPK activation. When present at a concentration of 10"6 M with<br>
T4, tetrac reduced MAPK phosphorylation and translocation by 86% when compared to<br>
cultures treated with T4 alone (Fig. 27), The inhibition increased to 97% when 10"4 M<br>
tetrac was added to the culture media for 16 h before the application of T4. Addition of<br>
aVp3 monoclonal antibody LM609 to the culture media 16 h prior to stimulation with T4<br>
also reduced T4-induced MAPK activation. LM609 at 0.01 and 0.001 u.g/ml of culture<br>
media did not affect MAPK activation following T4 treatment Increasing the concentration<br>
of antibody in the culture media to 0.1,1, and 10 p,g/ml reduced levels of phosphorylated<br>
MAPK found in the nuclear fractions of the cells by 29%, 80%, and 88%, respectively,<br>
when compared to cells treated with T4 alone.<br>
CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA to aV, 03 or both aV and P3<br>
and allowed to recover for 16 h before being placed in serum-free media. Following T4<br>
treatment for 30 min, the cells were harvested and either nuclear protein or RNA was<br>
extracted. Figure 28A demonstrates the specificity of each siRNA for the target integrin<br>
subunit. CV-1 cells transfected with either the aV siRNA or both aV and P3 siRNAs<br>
showed decreased aV subunit RT-PCR products, but there was no difference in aV mRNA<br>
expression when cells were transfected with the siRNA specific for P3, or when exposed to<br>
the transfection reagent in the absence of exogenous siRNA. Similarly, cells transfected<br>
with p3 siRNA had reduced levels of 03 mRNA, but relatively unchanged levels of ccV<br>
siRNA. The addition of T4 for 30 min did not alter mRNA levels for either aV or (33,<br>
regardless of the siRNA transfected into the cells.<br>
Activated MAPK levels were measured by western blot in CV-I cells transfected<br>
with siRNAs to aV and fi3, either individually or in combination (Fig. 28B). CV-I cells<br>
treated with scrambled negative control siRNA had slightly elevated levels of T4-induced<br>
activated MAPK when compared to the parental cell line. Cells exposed to the transfection<br>
reagent alone display similar levels and patterns of MAPK phosphorylation as the nontransfected<br>
CV-1 cells. When either aV siRNA or p3 siRNA, alone or in combination, was<br>
transfected into CV-1 cells, the level of phosphorylated MAPK in vehicle-treated cultures<br>
was elevated, but the ability of T4 to induce a further elevation in activated MAPK levels<br>
was inhibited.<br>
Example 26: Hormone-induced angiogenesis is blocked by antibody to aVp3<br>
Angiogenesis is stimulated in the CAM assay by application of physiological<br>
concentrations of T4 (Fig. 29A and summarized in Fig. 29B). 10~7 M T4 placed on the<br>
CAM filter disk induced blood vessel branch formation by 2.3-fold (P 
compared to PBS-treated membranes. Propylthiouracil, which prevents the conversion of<br>
T4 to T3, has no effect on angiogenesis caused by T4. The addition of a monoclonal<br>
antibody, LM609 (10¸μg/filter disk), directed against ctVfM, inhibited the pro-angiogenic<br>
response to T4.<br>

Thyroid Hormone analog and Anti-Cancer Activity:<br>
The thyroid honnone metabolites Triac and Tetrac are used in treatment of thyroid<br>
cancer to enrich and as substitute therapy for its needs.<br>
Commercially Available Thyroid Hormones &amp; its Analogs:<br>
There are several brand names synthetic thyroid hormones available in the market<br>
including Unithroid®, Levothroid®, Synthroid® and Levoxyl®. There are generic<br>
formulations like Levo-T®, Levothyroxine Sodium® and Novothyrox®.<br>
Natural Thyroid hormones are sold as food supplement in a dried and powdered form<br>
obtained from slaughtered animal's thyroid glands. This desiccated product pill may<br>
contain unwanted animal protein, improper balance of the T3 and T4 compounds and<br>
synthetic binders which is least recommended for human consumption. The ratio of T3<br>
to T4 may vary for each batch depending on the animal's gland and has not been found<br>
to be constant for any proper delivery in human subjects. The complication in dose,<br>
delivery and availability in the system argues for a standardized, constant, limited dose<br>
and temporal release regimen for safe human consumption and other topical uses.<br>
Thyroid Hormone Regulated Release System:<br>
As of today, no specific and standardized regimen of treatment for thyroid hormone<br>
replacement therapy is available to patients in United States. We are proposing a long<br>
term, permanent slow release system of individual thyroid constituents based on<br>
personalized needs presorted for the dose, desired activity and response profile in test<br>
systems. "We will be achieving it through the polymer bound thyroid constituents<br>
delivery to the site of these products for dose defining and in a limited distribution. The<br>
proposed conjugates (Fig 3 - a sketch) will have both short and longer term release<br>
capacity achieved through hydrolysable and non-hydrolysable characteristics. This will<br>
achieve the minimum dose level delivery for the specific cardio vascular and wound<br>
healing properties.<br>

Typical Polymeric Templates for Drug/API Conjugate's<br>
Conjugated Delivery Systems:<br>
Among the developing delivery systems, synthetic polymers conjugated chemical<br>
entities are gaining ground. A variety of synthetic, natural and biopolymeric origin side<br>
groups with efficient biodegradable backbone polymers are available and are in use in<br>
the trade. Poly alkyl glycols, polyesters, poly anhydride, poly saccharide, and poly<br>
amino acids are available for conjugation depending on the final characteristic of the<br>
conjugated product in terms of their hydrophilicity, hydrophobic nature, hydrolyses by<br>
enzymes, co-factors and biologically available acids in vivo as well as in vitro systems<br>
for the purpose.<br>
Polymer Conjugation-Synthesis &amp; Purification:<br>
We are proposing a library of conjugated products (see Fig 6 and Table-1) for the<br>
controlled, hydrolysable as well as non-hydrolysable polymer conjugate products<br>
including the biopolymers. A test case will evolve from each category of polymer<br>
products for their detailed study in terms of its pharmacokinetics covering delivery,<br>
transport, half-life and degradation arid or erosion data. The series will also be tried to<br>
prepare as a concurrent or library design of combinatorial synthesis fitting into the<br>
similar chemical class of reaction for the substrate and varying polymers utilizing DCC,<br>
DCC/HOBt based and other water soluble reagents including placement of linker and<br>
commonly used NHS ester based synthetic strategies with a view for future<br>
developments in the polymeric conjugation combinatorial or parallel synthesis. The<br>
available facilities of the synthesizer at PRJ will be utilized towards this effect and each<br>
product will be individually purified for suitability of the biological test systems.<br>
Sketch 4: Representative Polymer Conjugate Structures from Natural, Synthetic and<br>
Polypeptide Polymer Chain.<br>
Polymer Conjugates- Physical &amp; Chemical Characterization:<br>
A through spectro-analytical and cliromatographic analysis of the polymer bound<br>
compounds will be performed using NMR (High &amp; Low Field- Proton &amp; Carbon,<br>
DEPT, HOMOCOSY &amp; HETEROCOSY/HETCOR wherever applicable), IR, MS,<br>
HPLC, thermal and environmental degradation analysis for stability suitability and<br>
degradation rate profile.<br>
Release &amp; Stability Studies:<br>
A detailed HPLC analyses for quantitative release analyses will be undertaken based on<br>
our established protocol for the individual thyroid products i.e., GC-1, T3, T4 and<br>
DITPA as well as Triac and Tetrae along with individual polymer and polymer<br>
conjugated product's chromatographic and spectro-analytical profile.<br>
Polymers Compatibility Criteria for Conjugation:<br>
Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers have been designated as probable carriers<br>
for long term and short time delivery vehicles including non hydrolysable polymeric<br>
conjugates (table 1). PEGs and PEOs are the most common hydroxyl end polymers with<br>
a wide range of molecular weights to choose for the purpose of solubility (easy carrier<br>
mode), degradation times and ease of conjugation. One end protected Methoxy-PEGs<br>
will also be employed as a straight chain carrier capable of swelling and thereby<br>
reducing the chances of getting protein attached or stuck during the subcellular<br>
transportation. Certain copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, i.e. EVAc which have<br>
exceptionally good biocompatibility, low crystallinity and hydrophobic in nature are<br>
ideal candidate for encapsulation mediated drug delivery carrier.<br>
Polymers with demonstrated high half-life and in-system retention properties will be<br>
undertaken for conjugation purpose. Among the most common and recommended<br>
biodegradable polymers from lactic and glycolic acids will be used. The copolymers of<br>
L-lactide, and L-lysine is useful because of its availability of amine functional groups<br>
for amide bond formation and this serves as a longer lasting covalent bonding site of the<br>
carrier and transportable thyroid compound linked together through the carboxyl moiety<br>
in all the thyroid constituents.<br>
The naturally occurring polysaccharides from cellulose, chitin, dextran, ficoll, pectin,<br>
carrageenan (all subtypes), and alginate and some of their semi-synthetic derivatives are<br>
ideal carriers due to its high biocompatibility, bio systems familiar degradation products<br>
(mono saccharide from glucose and fructose), hydrophilic nature, solubility, protein<br>
immobilization/interaction for longer term stability of the polymer matrix. This provides<br>
a shell for extra protection for polymer matrix from degradation over time and adding to<br>
the effective half life of the conjugate.<br>
Protein &amp; Polypeptide from serum albumin, collagen, gelatin and poly-L-lysine, poly-Lalanine,<br>
poly-L-serine are natural amino acids based drug carrier with advantage of<br>
biodegradation, biocompatibility and moderate release times of the carrier molecule.<br>
Poly-L-serine is of further interest due to its different chain derivatives, e.g., poly serine<br>
ester, poly serine imine and conventional poly serine polymeric backbone with available<br>
sites for specific covalent conjugation.<br>
Synthetic hydrogels from methacrylate derived polymers have been frequently used in<br>
biomedical applications because of their similarity to the living tissues. The most widely<br>
used synthetic hydrogels are polymers of acrylic acid, acrylamide and 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate (HEMA). The poly HEMA are inexpensive, biocompatible, available<br>
primary alcohol side chain elongation functionality for conjugation and fit for ocular,<br>
intraocular and other ophthalmic applications which makes them perfect drug delivery<br>
materials. The pHEMA are immune to cell attachment and provides zero cell motility<br>
which makes them an ideal candidate for internal delivery system.<br>
Synthetic thyroid analog DITPA conjugation library design program has been achieved<br>
with the development of crude DITPA conjugated products. PVA and PEG hydrophilic<br>
polymer coupling mediated through Dicycolhexyl Carbodiimide and by other coupling<br>
reagents of hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature is under progress.<br>
The design for the evolution of library synthesis on solid phase synthesizer is in its final<br>
stages and a model for its high throughput screening (HTS) will be put in place based on<br>
commonality of testing system and parametric criteria. The statistical analyses for the<br>
delivery time, half-life and conceived stability of the conjugates will be accumulated for<br>
the puipose of structure delivery analyses (SDA). Following is a list of intended<br>
polymer conjugates for preparation (Table 8).<br>
