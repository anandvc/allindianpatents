"AN APPARATUS FOR EXTRUDING AT LEAST FIRST AND SECOND TYPES OF LIQUID MATERIALS"<br>
NORDSON CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio and having its principal office at 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
31-8-2007<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
3 1 AUG 2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for extruding at least first and second types of liquid materials.<br>
This application relates to U.S. application serial number 09/702,385  (Atty. docket no. NOR-927), assigned to the assignee of the present invention and filed on even date herewith.   The disclosure of this related application is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to apparatus for extruding thermoplastic filaments and, more particularly, apparatus for spunbonding multi-component filaments.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Spunbonding or other techniques for extruding fine diameter filaments find many different applications in various industries including, for example, in nonwoven material manufacturing.   This technology generally   . involves extruding a thermoplastic material from multiple rows of discharge outlets extending along the lower surface of an elongate spinneret. Spunbonded materials are used in such products as diapers, surgical gowns,<br><br><br>
carpet backings, filters and many other consumer and industrial products. The machines for spunbonding such materials can be very large with the filament discharge outlets numbering in the thousands.<br>
For certain applications, it is desirable to utilize multiple types of thermoplastic liquid materials to form individual cross^sectional portions of each filament.   Often, these multi-componenHilamentsucbmprise two<br>
components and, therefore, are reierred to aVbicomponent filaments.   For<br>
.' /   .    r'    '	'■'	.    ■   *<br>
example, when manufacturing nonwoveh materials for use in the garment<br><br><br>
industry, it may be desirable to produce bicomponent-filaments having a<br><br>
sheath-core construction.   The sheath may be "formed from a softer material which is comfortable to the skin of an individual and the core may be formed from a stronger, .but perhaps less comfortable material having greater tensile strength to provide durability to the garment.   Another important consideration involves cost of the material.   For example, a core of inexpensive material may be combined with a sheath of more expensive material.   For example, the core may be formed from polypropylene or nylon and the sheath may be formed from a polyester or co-polyester.   Many other multi-component fiber configurations exist, including side-by-side, tipped, and microdenier configurations, each having its own special applications.  Various material properties can be controlled using one or more of the component liquids.   These include, as examples, thermal, chemical, electrical, optical, fragrance, and anti-microbial properties. Likewise, many types of die tips exist for combining the multiple liquid<br><br><br>
components just prior to discharge or extrusion to produce filaments of the desired cross-sectional configuration;<br>
One problem associated with multi component extrusion apparatus involves the cost and complexity of  the .manifolds used to<br><br>
transmit each of the separate component liquids/to the multi-component die<br>
tip.   Typical manifolds must be'machined with many different passages<br>
leading to the die tip to ensure that the proper flow of each component liquid reaches the die tip under the proper pressure and temperature conditions.  These manifolds are therefore relatively complex and expensive components of the multi-component extrusion apparatus.<br>
For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide multi-component extrusion apparatus having a manifold system which may be easily manufactured and yet fulfils the requirement of effectively transmitting each of the component liquids to the multi-component die tip.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention therefore provides an apparatus for extruding multiple types of liquid materials into multi-component filaments including a unique manifold structure coupled with a multi-component die tip.  Generally, the invention pertains to melt spinning apparatus, such as spunbonding and meltblowing apparatus.  The preferred or illustrative embodiment specifically disclosed herein relates to a spunbonding apparatus.   In one general aspect, the apparatus-comprises an intermediate manifold element having first and second opposite surfaces.   First and<br><br>
second outer manifold elements respectively couple to'the first and second<br><br>
opposite surfaces and have respective opposed  Surfaces.   Each opposed<br><br>
surface respectively abuts one of the first and (second opposite surfaces of<br>
the intermediate manifold element.   A first channel's formed,between the<br>
opposed surface of the first outer manifold element and the.first opposite<br>
surface of the intermediate manifold element.   A second channel is formed<br>
between the opposed surface of the second outer manifold element and the<br>
second opposite surface of the intermediate manifold element.   The first<br>
and second channels have inlets for respectively receiving the first and<br>
second liquids and outlets for respectively discharging the first and second<br>
liquids.   These inlets and outlets may be formed in the intermediate<br>
manifold element, in the outer manifold elements, or between the<br><br>
intermediate manifold element and the respective.outer manifold elements. The first and second channels may comprise recesses formed in the first and second opposite surfaces of the intermediate manifold element, or . recesses formed in the opposed surfaces of the first and second outer manifold elements, or any combination thereof which forms the necessary channels.<br>
A die tip is coupled adjacent the manifold elements.   The die tip includes a plurality of multi-component filaments discharge outlets and at least first and second liquid distribution passages.   The first and'second liquid distribution passages are adapted to receive the first and second liquids respectively from the outlets of the first and second channels.   A liquid combining member communicates between the first and second liquid<br><br><br>
distribution passages and the filament discharge outlets.. The liquid<br><br>
combining member is configured to receive the firsthand/second liquids and<br>
combine the first and second liquids into respective mtilti-compon'eht<br>
filaments.	<br>
In a more specific preferred embodiment^of the manifqld<br>
structure, the first and second outer manifold elements have-respective<br>
recesses and, more preferably, a plurality of recesses on their respective<br>
opposed surface.   The intermediate manifold element is coupled between<br>
the respective opposed surfaces of the first and second outer manifold<br>
elements.   The recesses on the respective first and second opposite<br>
surfaces of the intermediate manifold element communicate, and preferably<br>
align with corresponding recesses on the opposed surfaces of the first and<br>
second outer manifold elements.  The communicating recesses together<br>
form at least first and second channels and, preferably, first and second<br>
pluralities of channels each having a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet<br>
communicating with the die tip on the opposite sides of the intermediate<br>
manifold element.	<br>
Various advantages, objectives, and features of the invention . will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of, the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view/of a.multi-component<br><br>
spunbonding apparatus constructed in accordance with a preferred,<br><br>
%&gt;■<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross section taken along  line 2-2 of Fig 1  but illustrating the manifold elements and die tip in assembled condition.<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of the die tip shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a spunbonding apparatus 10 constructed in accordance with the inventive principles includes first and second outer manifold elements 12, 14.   An intermediate manifold element 16 is coupled between outer manifold elements 12, 14 in sandwiching relation.   A die tip or spin pack assembly 18 is coupled to outer manifold elements 12, 14 and intermediate manifold element 16 by fastener assemblies 20.   Threaded fasteners (not shown) are inserted through holes 22, 24 in the respective outer manifold elements 12, 14 and thread into internally threaded holes 26 contained in intermediate manifold element 16. Although only holes 26 are shown, it will be appreciated that the opposite side of manifold element 16 has similar threaded holes.   A liquid supply block 30 is mounted to an upper surface of intermediate manifold element 16 and includes a plurality of pumps 32a, ,32b for respectively pumping first and second types of liquid, such as thermoplastic material.   The first type of liquid is pumped into each inlet 40 and the second type of liquid is<br><br><br>
pumped into each inlet 42 in the top of intermediate manifold element 16. Although three sets of pumps 32a, 32b are shown in. this preferred<br>
embodiment, it will be understood that a greater or.'fewer number of pump<br>
i<br>
sets 32a, 32b may be provided instead.   Alternatively, other manners of<br>
supplying manifolds 12, 14, 16 with multiple types of}liquids;may\be<br>
employed instead.   In addition, the side-by-side manifoldcon.cepts of this<br>
invention may be employed to form filaments from more than two<br>
component liquids.<br>
As shown best in Fig. 2, outer manifold elements 12, 14<br>
include respective opposed notches 44, 46 communicating with liquid<br>
supply inlets 40, 42.   Corresponding notches 48,.50 are formed in opposite<br>
side surfaces of intermediate manifold element 1 6 such that respective<br>
channels 52, 54 are formed for receiving the component liquids from inlets<br>
40, 42.   Recesses 56, 58 are formed in opposed sides of outer manifold<br>
elements 12, 14 and align with corresponding recesses 60, 62 formed on<br>
opposite sides of intermediate manifold element 16.   These aligned<br>
recesses form respective channels 64, 66 which communicate at respective<br>
upper ends thereof with channels 52, 54 and which further include<br>
discharge outlets 70, 72 at lower ends thereof.   It will be appreciated that<br>
channels 64, 66 may instead be formed by recesses formed only on<br>
intermediate manifold element 1 6 or only on outer manifold elements 1 2,<br>
14 and, in that case, the abutting manifold element will serve as a cover<br>
plate.   As appreciated from Fig. 1, each channel 64, 66 formed respectively<br>
between recesses 56, 60 and recesses 58, 62 diverges or widens in a<br><br><br>
lengthwise direction relative to   the lengthwise extents of manifold elements<br>
12, 14, 16 from inlet channels 5'2 54 to;olitlets-70, 72.<br>
Referring to Figs 2 and 3 die'tip 18 more specifically<br>
comprises a conventional spin patk 'assembly.   The details of assembly 18<br><br>
are more specifically disclosed In  U.S. Patent No. 5,562,930, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.   Generally, die tip 18 comprises a top plate 80, a screen support plate 82, a metering plate 84, an etched distributor plate 86 and a spinneret plate 88 held together by fasteners 90.   The respective first and second liquids enter slots 100, 102 formed on the upper surface of top plate 80 from outlets 70, 72 of channels 64, 66.  The first and second liquids then enter a series of passages 104 and a series of passages 106 communicating with respective cavities 108, 110.  The two liquids then' respectively travel through filters 112, 114 and enter liquid component slots 116, 118.   Slot 116 communicates with holes 120 and slot 118 communicates with holes 122. One of several slots 1 24 is shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for receiving one of the two component liquids from hole 120 or hole 122.   Although not shown in the drawings, another alternating series of slots is provided for the other component liquid.  Apertures 1 28 are provided for the first component liquid and apertures 1 30 are provided for the second component liquid in metering plate 84.<br>
The etched distributor plate 86 receives the mutually separated component liquids and combines these liquids in the desired manner as the liquids reach the discharge passages 140.   The multi-<br><br>
component filaments are then discharged through outlets 142.   Holes 160 or 162 located along the length of each outer manifold element 1 2, 1 4 receive heater rods for heating the two liquids and the process air to an appropriate application temperature.   Temperature sensing devices (not shown), such as RTD's or thermocouples are also placed in manifold elements 12, 14 to control the temperature.   A more complete description and operation of the die tip or spin pack 18 may be found in the above incorporated U.S. Patent No. 5,562,930.   In addition, it will be appreciated that many other die tip assemblies may be used for spunbonding applications or other multi-component filaments extrusion applications and that this disclosure is merely illustrative of one preferred configuration.<br>
