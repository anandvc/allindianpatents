NEW SALTS OF ANIONIC COMPLEXES OF RU(III),  AS ANTIMETASTATIC AND ANT1NEOPLASTIC AGENTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new salts of anionic complexes of Ru(lll) with lammonium   cations   which   are   particularly   useful   as   antimetastatic   and "antineoplastic agents. STATE-OF-THE-ART<br>
The discovery of the antineoplastic properties of cisplatin (cis-diammino-dichioro-platinum (II)), so far widely used both in antitumor mono- and polychemotherapy, has fostered the interest in the study of the antitumor activity of the metallo-organic complexes. As for many antitumor agents, the specificity of action of the cisplatin, is directed towards neoplasms which affect specific compartments (testis, ovary, bladder, head-neck), while other kinds of tumors, such as those localised in the lungs, and, in the breast and the colon-rectal tumor,.are almost insensitive to treatment with this drug (C.F.J. Barnard et a!., Chemistry in Britain, 1001-1004, 1986).<br>
Thus, research in the field of the coordination complexes is aimed at the development of new drugs containing Pt and/or other transition elements which can enable both the enlargement of the spectrum of use and the achievement of toxicity levels lower than those of the antitumor agents which are known in the state-of-the-art.<br>
The potentiality of the use of ruthenium as antitumor agent as an alternative to platinum was studied for complexes of Ru (II) like, for example, cis-Ru(ll)-tetrakis-dimethylsulfoxide (T. Giraldi et al.,  Cancer Res., 37, 2662,  1977) and more recently for neutral complexes of Ru (III), such as fac-[RuCI3 (NH3)3] (M.J. Clarke, Metal Ions in Biological Systems, 11(5), 231-281, 1980, Helmut Sigel Ed.). Moreover, several anionic complexes of Ru(lll) with 5-membered heterocycles have been prepared, in particular imidazolium-bis-imidazole-tetrachloro-ruthenate (111) (B.K. Keppleretal., J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., 111: 166-168, 1986). More recently, some Ru(lll) complexes with DMSO have been developed; in particular, the WO 90/13553 international patent application describes some<br><br>
2 Ru(lll) complexes having the formula (i):<br><br>
where RxRySO is a suifoxide, preferably dimethylsulphoxide, A is a suiphoxide or<br>
a chloride and B is a nitrogen ligand, selected from the group consisting of<br>
ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, and heterocycies containing<br>
nitrogen atoms.<br>
These complexes, which can be used as antineoplastic agents, are neutral when<br>
A is a suifoxide, while they possess a negative charge when A is a chloride; in this<br>
latter case, the anionic complexes are isolated in the form of the corresponding<br>
salts with alkaline and alkaline earth cations and preferably sodium.<br>
Despite their antimetastatic activity, the above mentioned complexes exhibit some<br>
serious   inconveniences  which   make  the  administration   and  formulation   in<br>
adequate therapeutical compositions extremely difficult. As a matter of fact, these<br>
anionic complexes when isolated in the form of sodium salts, always contained<br>
two solvent.molecules of crystallisation and cannot be isolated in a pure form, that<br>
is without these crystallisation molecules.<br>
in particular, the [trans-RuCl4(DMSO)lm]Na 2DMS0, corresponding to formula (i)<br>
where Rx=Ry=methyl, A=CI, B=imidazole and where the negative charge has been<br>
neutralized by Na+, is capable of exerting good antineoplastic and antimetastatic<br>
activities on tumor models in mice. Moreover, this salt has been characterised by<br>
good water solubility which allows for an easier administration.<br>
However,   this  compound  can   be  isolated  only  with  two  DMSO   solvation<br>
molecules,  as evidenced in the examples reported in the above mentioned"<br>
international patent application (in particular, in the Examples 3, 4, 8 and 10)<br>
which reduce the compound stability.<br>
Moreover, a qualitative variability of the crystallisation molecules, which can be<br>
DMSO, acetone and water, and more commonly two dimethylsulfoxide molecules<br>
(DMSO) (E. Alessio et al. lnorganica Chimica Acta, 203 (1993): 205-217) can be<br>
observed.<br><br>
3<br>
The fact that the crystallisation molecules vary in a way which is hardly controlled from one preparation to another causes problems of uncertainty in structural analysis, in the molecular weight determination and in the elemental analysis. Hence, problems related to the of the purity of the compound and its subsequent formulation may occur. As a matter of fact, the scarce structural  reproducibility of these compounds implies that not always the same amount of ruthenium corresponds to the administered dose. Thus non-constant dosages and therapeutical activities that cannot easily be foreseen reduce the pharmacological interest of these compounds.<br>
A further disadvantage of the above mentioned compound is due to pharmacological negative effects caused by DMSO, introduced in the organism in equimolar or double quantities with respect to the ruthenium complex and to its differentiating properties, as reported by Klaas Kramer et al. (Gen. Pharmac, vol. 26, n° 6, pp. 1403-1497, 1995).<br>
Finally, since the above mentioned salts contain solvation molecules, they rapidly<br>
*<br>
degrade when exposed to open air at room temperature up to providing some<br>
brown semisolid substance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The Applicant has now surprisingly found new salts of Ru(lll) anionic complexes<br>
with   ammonium   cations   which   exhibit   a   remarkable   antimetastatic   and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The features and the advantages of the present invention will be better illustrated in the course of the following detailed description.<br>
In the above mentioned salts of formula (I), the nitrogen atom of the nitrogen compound of formula NR1R2R3   supplies its long pair in the formation of the coordination bond with the Ru(lll) atom.<br>
More specificafly, in the salts of the invention, R1 is preferably the same as R2 and R3 and they are H or ethyl.<br>
When NR1R2R3 is a 5-membered nitrogen containing heterocycle, it selected from the group consisting of imidazole, N-methyl-imidazole, pyrazole, and oxazole; most preferably said nitrogen-containing heterocycie is imidazole. When NR1R2R3 is a 6-membered heterocycie, it is selected preferably in the group consisting of pyridine, pyrazine, 3,5-lutidine and 4-methylpyridine. When NR1R2R3    is a 7-membered heterocycie, it is selected from the group consisting of azepine, diazepine, and oxazepine.<br>
Finally, when said heterocycie is condensed with a benzo group, it is selected preferably from the group consisting of indazole, isoquinoline, benzimidazole and 1,5,6-trymethyl-benzimidazole.<br>
In the salts of the invention of formula (I), the R4-SO-R5 sulphoxide ligand is preferably dimethylsuifoxide (R4=R5=methyl), diethylsulphoxide (R4=R5=ethyl) or tetramethylensulphoxide (together with the S atom, R4 and R5 form a 5-membered ring).<br>
These salts can unexpectedly exert an antitumor and in particular antimetastatic activity which is significantly higher than that of the corresponding sodium salts, when equimolar doses and equal treatment patterns are applied. Moreover, the salts of formula (I), with respect to those described in the state-of-the-art, are much more favourable since they are indefinitely stable in the air, while the corresponding sodium salts, being extremely hygroscopic, are easily subject to hydrolysis. In addition to that, with respect to the known complexes, the<br><br>
6<br>
salts of the invention do not exhibit the pharmacological drawbacks which are due<br>
to the presence of DMSO crystallisation molecules.<br>
Since the salts of formula (I) have no crystallisation molecules, they have constant<br>
MW values as well as reproducible analytical results. This allows for formulations<br>
containing  definite  amounts of  active compound  and   consistently  constant<br>
dosages.<br>
The salts of Ru(lll) complexes of formula (I) are obtained by means of a new<br>
particularly easy and favourable procedure which comprises the following steps:<br>
1) reactions of RuCI3 with R4-SO-R5 in the presence of HCl to produce the<br>
complex of formula (Il)<br><br>
where R4 and R5 have the above reported meanings.<br>
In this reaction step, R4 and R5 are preferably methyl, that is RUCI3 undergoes<br>
reaction   with   dimethyisulfoxide      (DMSO)   to   produce   [(Me2S0)2H]   [trans-<br>
RuCl4(Me2SO)2].<br>
According to a preferred way of preparation, RUCI3 is previously dissolved in a<br>
heated      organic   solvent,   preferably   ethanol   or   methanol;.  R4-SO-R5   and<br>
concentrated HCI are added to the solution obtained in this way and heated at a<br>
temperature ranging preferably from 60 and 90°C, and even more preferably at a<br>
temperature of about 80°C.<br>
2) The complex (II), obtained from step (1), is reacted at room temperature with a<br>
NR1R2R3 nitrogen containing compound, in molar ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:6 in<br>
one or more organic solvents, preferably acetone and dichloromethane, to provide<br>
the salts of formula (I), according to the scheme reported hereunder:<br><br>
7<br><br>
where R1-R5 have the previoulsy defined meanings.<br>
In the step (2), the intermediate (II) reacts with the NR1R2R3 nitrogen containing<br>
compound by leading to the replacement of one of the two axial sulphoxide<br>
groups and to the protonation of a molecule of the nitrogen compound and to the<br>
final release of two sulphoxide crystallisation molecules. Thus the complexes (I)<br>
are obtained in very high yields.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the use of the above salts (I) in the<br>
treatment of neoplasms of a various nature and in the prevention of the formation<br>
of metastases. The above neoplasms are preferably solid spawning tumors, such<br>
as the carcinoma of the gastro-intestinal tract, the mammary carcinoma, the lung<br>
tumors, the metastatic carcinoma and the lung metastases of metastatic tumors.<br>
The salts of the invention can be profitably administered    by parenteral, oral,<br>
topical or transdermal route.<br>
Among    the    parenteral    administration,     the     intravenous,     intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes are preferred.<br>
The   dosage   of  these   salts   varies   according   to   the   route   and  ways   of<br>
administration as well as to the seriousness of the neoplasms; besides, it varies in<br>
relation to age, to the body weight and to the general healthiness of the patient.<br><br>
8<br>
The therapeutically effective close of these salts, to be administered in single or<br>
multiple doses, ranges preferably from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg/day and even more<br>
preferably is 10-200 mg/kg/day, when these salts are administered parenterally,<br>
while orally the dosages are from 3 to 10 times higher than the above reported<br>
range.<br>
Moreover, the above salts (I) can profitably be used in experimental protocols of<br>
polychemotherapy in combination with other antitumor drugs of common clinical<br>
use in the above described pathologies,  such as for example cisplatin,  5-<br>
fluorouracil, vinblastin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, anthracycline, taxol.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing, as<br>
an active compound, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one salt of<br>
formula (I) in combination with suitable excipients and/or diluents.<br>
These pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared in the form of solutions or<br>
suspensions, both in aqueous and non-aqueous media, which are particularly<br>
suitable for intravenous injections, infusions and intramuscular or subcutaneous<br>
injections.  These  solutions can  be prepared  before  use,  by solubilizing  or<br>
suspending the lyophilized compounds of the invention in suitable solvents.<br>
Solid or semisolid compositions in the form of inserts, gels or ointments for<br>
topical, dermal or transdermal administration or in the form of powder, pills,<br>
tablets, and capsules are also indicated. Furthermore, the salts of the invention<br>
can be administered in the form of controlied-release compositions which are<br>
known in the state-of-the-art.<br>
The above compositions can be prepared easily according to procedures which<br>
are known in the state-of-the-art.<br>
The following examples are reported to illustrate the invention without limiting it:<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of [trans-RuCI4(Me2SO)2][ (Me2SO)2H] complex corresponding to<br>
formula (II) where R4=R5=methyl.<br>
1  g of RUCI3 3 H2O (0,0038 moles) was suspended in 30 ml    ethanol and<br>
underwent reflux heating for three hours to obtain a dark green solution. The<br><br>
9<br>
solution was filtered on paper to remove possible traces of undissolved solid; it was then concentrated by using a rotary evaporator up to 1/10 of the initial volume; therefore, 1 ml of aqueous concentrated HCI, 37% and 2 ml of DMSO were added and the mixture obtained in this way was kept at a temperature of 80°C for about 15 minutes, up to obtaining a bright orange solution. After cooling of the mixture to room temperature and after addition of 10 ml acetone, the product, after setting up, separated from the solution in the form of red-orange crystals; the formation of these crystals was accelerated by the addition of a few drops of ethyl ether. The crystals were then collected on a filter, washed with cold acetone (20 ml), then with ethyl ether (10 ml) and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature. 1.5 g of the final product with a 72% yield was obtained.<br>
The physico-chemical features of [trans-RuCI4(Me2SO)2][ (Me2SO)2H]  are as follows:<br>
-	physical state:       a red-orange, crystalline solid<br>
-	raw formula:	C8H25Cl4O4RuS4<br>
-molecular weight: 556,40<br>

Moreover, the IR and UV spectra and the determination of the structure by means<br>
of X-rays turned out to be in agreement with what reported by E. Alessio et al.<br>
(above mentioned reference).<br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of [trans-RuCI4(DMSO) (lm)][lmH] corresponding to formula (I)<br>
where NR1R2R3 is imidazole (Im) and R4=R5=methyl.<br>
1,0 g (0,0018 moles) of the [trans-RuCI4(Me2SO)2][ (Me2SO)2H] complex prepared<br>
as described in Example N.1, was suspended  in acetone (20 ml) at room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
10<br>
After the addition of 0.49 g (0.0072 moles) of imidazole, the mixture was kept under stirring for 4 hours; during this time the colour of the precipitate gradually changed from orange to brick red. After being collected on a filter and washed with acetone (10 ml) and therefore with ethyi ether (10 mi), the product was dried under vacuum at room temperature or in a oven at 60°C for a few hours. Hence, 0.75 g of final product were obtained with a 92% yield. The physico-chemical properties of [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (lm)][lmH] are as follows:<br>

methylimidazole as described in Example N.2, and 0.8 g of final product were<br>
obtained in a 93% yield.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
i) In vivo activity test of the salts (I), according to the present invention, on<br>
mice affected by Lewis Lung Carcinoma.<br>
Example (i)-A<br>
Materials and methods<br>
Three groups, each made up of 10 female BD2F1 mice of 21 ±1 g, obtained from<br>
Charles River (Calco, Como, Italy) were inoculated by intramuscular injection, with<br>
106 Lewis lung carcinoma cells suspended in 0,05 ml of a Dulbecco's buffered<br>
calcium and magnesium-free solution (PBS) using a sterile insulin syringe.<br>
The tumor line was obtained by the Tumor Repository Bank, NCI, NIH, Bethesda<br>
(USA) and maintained in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Five days after the above inoculation, the average weight of the tumor was equal<br>
to 0,4 ± 0,01 g. From the 5th to the 11th day, the three groups of mice were<br>
treated intraperitoneally as follows:<br>
Group 1 - Control: 10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free<br><br>
14<br>
physiological solution;<br>
Group 2-10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free physiological<br>
solution containing 44 mg of [trans-RuCU(DMSO) (Im)] Na 2DMSO, as described<br>
in the above mentioned WO 90/13553 international patent application;<br>
Group 3-10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free physiological<br>
solution containing 35 mg of [trans-RuCI4(DMSO) (Im)] [ImH] (Example 2);<br>
12 days after inoculation, the primary tumor was surgically removed.<br>
21 days after inoculation, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the<br>
lung metastases were counted. The lungs were abducted immediately after death<br>
of the mice and were divided in single lobes, which were then subsequently<br>
examined by the use of a low magnification stereoscopic microscope, equipped<br>
with a grid on the eye-piece, which allowed the detection of a and b orthogonal<br>
axes (where a<b></b>
The lung metastases were then classified according to their dimensions and the<br>
weight of the metastases for each animal was then calculated as the sum of the<br>
weight of each single metastases, each one regarded as a solid by means of the<br>
formula (n /6) a2xb. The experimental data obtained were then processed with the<br>
Student- Newmann-Keuls statistical test.<br>
The results obtained are hereunder reported in Table 1, where the number of<br>
metastases and their weight in both groups of treated mice (2) and (3) are<br>
reported with respect to the control Group (1). The figures are reported as the<br>
average    ±    S.    E.    of   the    single    values    obtained    for    each    group.<br><br>

The figures reported  above outline the fact that the treatment with  [trans-<br>
RuCU(DMSO) (lm)][lmH] according to the present invention causes a reduction<br>
both in the weight and in the number of metastases which is higher than the one<br>
obtained with the reference compound known in the state of the art.<br>
The % reduction in the number of metastases and in their weight is hereunder<br>

The advantages obtained with the compound of the invention with respect to the reference compound, as known in the state-of-the-art, are pointed out even more neatly by the figures reported above.<br>
After the above treatments, the lung metastases isolated from the groups (1) and (3) of mice were counted and divided in three groups according to the diameter dimensions (d): metastases with a diameter d2mm (large). The results obtained are hereunder reported in Table 3.<br>
Table 3: distribution according to diameter dimensions (d) of lung metastases in mice affected by Lewis lung carcinoma, treated with the compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
These figures outline the fact that metastatic nodules of medium and large<br>
dimensions in the group of animals treated are scarcely present (nodules of<br>
medium dimensions) or absent (nodules of large dimension) with respect to the<br>
controls.<br>

ii) In vivo activity test of the compounds of the invention in mice affected by MCa mammary carcinoma EXAMPLE (ii)-A: Materials and Methods<br>
Three groups of 7 female CBA mice of 23±2 g, obtained from a colony grown according to the procedures for kin animals. The colony obtained originally from Chester Beatthy Institute of London, was subsequently kept by means of serial couplings between kins (brother and sister) in a ratio ranging from 1:1 to 1:4. The couplings took place at the peak of the sexual maturity of the animals born in the 5th week. Animals underweight or with evident organic anomalies were discarded. The three groups were inoculated by intramuscular injection, with 106 Lewis lung carcinoma cells suspended in 0,05 ml of a Dulbecco's buffered calcium and magnesium-free physiological solution (PBS) using a sterile syringe.<br><br>
19<br>
The tumor line was obtained from Rudjer Boskovic Institute and maintained in<br>
liquid nitrogen.<br>
13 days after inoculation, the average tumor weight was 1.2 ± 0.2 g. From day 13<br>
to 18, the three groups of mice were treated intraperitoneally as follows:<br>
Group 1  - Control: 10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free<br>
physiological solution;<br>
Group 2-10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free physiological<br>
solution containing 44 mg of [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (lm)]Na . 2 DMSO, as described<br>
in the above mentioned WO 90/13553 international patent application;<br>
Group 3-10 mf/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free physiological<br>
solution containing 35 mg of [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (Im)] [ImH] (Example 2).<br>
19 days after inoculation, the primary tumor was surgically removed.<br>
27 days after inoculation, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the<br>
lung metastases were then counted, as described in the test (i).<br>
The experimental figures obtained were then processed according to Student-<br>
Newmann-Keuls statistical test.<br>
In order to evaluate the activity of the salts of the invention, the primary tumor was<br>
removed surgically from the mice in the three above groups and dissected. One<br>
tumor for each group was selected in a random way and 10 sections/tumor<br>
obtained in such a way to evaluate the whole neoplastic mass. The tumor slices<br>
were fixed in 10% formaline, embedded in paraffin and stained with the Cajal-<br>
Gallego dye in order to evidence the epithelial cells, the connective matrix and the<br>
presence  of erythrocytes.  The   infiltration  was  evaluated   by  observing  the<br>
degranulation of the polymorphonucleates (PMN) as well as the presence of<br>
apoptotic bodies.<br>
Results:<br>
The results obtained are reported in Table 5, where the number of metastases<br>
and their weight obtained in the groups (2) and (3) with respect to the control<br>
group (1). The figures were expressed as the average ± S.E. of the single values<br>
obtained for each group.<br><br>

The results related to the effect of the salts of the invention are hereunder reported in Table 7.<br>
Table 7: Effects of the compounds according to the present invention on the primary tumor.<br><br>
From the figures reported above it is possible to detect that the [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (lm)][lmH] compound, with respect to the [trans-RuCI4(DMSO) (lm)]Na 2DMS0 reference compound, 44 mg/kg/day, causes profound hystologic modifications. In particular, the tumor treated with the salt according to the present invention  has wide hemorrhagic and  necrotic areas combined with<br><br>
22<br>
neutrophilic leukocytes, a neat degranulation of the polymorphonucleates (PMN),<br>
the presence of a large number of apoptoptic bodies and the thicknening of the<br>
connective capsule surrounding the tumor.<br>
These results are even more evident in the figures where the outer connective<br>
capsule is labelled with a C letter (figure A1, B1 and C1), while the necrotic area<br>
is labelled with the N letter (Figure A2, B2 and C2).<br>
Without  meaning to restrict the  mechanism  of action with  which  the  salts<br>
according to the present invention exert their pharmacological effects, the above<br>
observations contribute to explain, at least partially, the antimetastatic effect of<br>
the above salts as the result of the prevention of the tumor cell spawning from the<br>
primary tumor.<br>
Example (ii)-B Materials and methods<br>
Two groups of 12 and one group of 14 (controls) female CBA mice of 22g<br>
obtained from a colony grown according to the procedures for kin animals were<br>

From the 9th to the 14th day since the inoculation, the three groups of mice were<br>
daily treated intraperitoneally as follows:<br>
Group 1 - Control: 10 ml/kg of body weight/day of a sterile and pyrogen-free<br>

the average weight of the primary tumor at the beginning and in the end of the<br>
treatment with the salts of the invention, as well as the percentage variation of the<br>

From the figures reported above, it is evident that the reduced growth of the primary tumor in the groups treated with the salts of Ru(lll) complexes,  as normalized by the controls, is 18,7% for [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (NH3) ]Na  2DMSO while it is 32,8% in [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (NH3)] NH4. These figures show that the [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (NH3)] NH4 of the present invention can exert antitumor effects on the growth of the primary tumor which are remarkably higher with respect to the known compounds in the state-of-the-art.

19 days after inoculation, the primary tumor was surgically removed.<br>
33 days after inoculation, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the<br>
lung metastases were counted. The lungs were abducted immediately after death<br>

examined by the use of a low magnification stereoscopic microscope, equipped<br>
with a grid on the eye-piece, which allowed the detection of a and b orthogonal<br>

* p
The dosages chosen for the comparison of the effects of [trans-RuCl4(DMSO) (lm)][lmH] and cisplatin on solid metastasizing tumors are comparable in that they represent the maximum tolerated doses with the treatment adopted (1 injection /day/ for 6 consecutive days).<br>
The comparison of the effects of the compound of the invention and cisplatin on the loss of body weight gain during tratment shows that the ruthenium compound (% loss body weight gain vs control= +1 (lewis lung car), -6 (Mca mammary car.)) is always less toxic than cisplatin (% loss body weight gain vs control= -11). The comparison of spleen weight of the treated animals (% loss spleen weight vs controi= -11) also shows that the drug treatment with the compound of the invention is much better tolerated than that of with cisplatin animals (% loss spleen weight vs control= -52).<br>
On tumor metastasis, the compound of the invention is as effective (Mca mammary carcinoma) or even more effective (Lewis lung carcinoma and TS/A<br><br>

adenocarcinama) than cisplatin: It reduces the number of lung metastasis either when given at early stages of tumor growth, ie prior to surgical ablation (TS/A adenocarcinoma) or when it is given to mice with lung metastases in advanced stage of growth, ie after surgical ablation of primary tumour (Lewis lung carcinoma) and the reduction of lung metastases is in agreement with a significant prolongation of the post-surgical life time expentancy of the treated mice (Mca mammary carcinoma)<br>
The in vivo experimental models reported above are related to the treatment, with the compounds of the present invention, of two solid spawning tumors in rodents at an advanced stage of growth. A statistically significant and marked reduction both in the growth of the primary tumor and in the formation of lung metastases is observed. This reduction, as can be seen both in the model (i) of Lewis lung carcinoma and in model (ii) of MCa mammary carcinoma, is to be ascribed to a pronounced inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. In fact, with respect to the controls, the presence of medium/large dimensions in groups of animals treated is notably lower or even inexistent in as far as large nodules are concerned., In particular, from the overall comparison of the data regarding effective reduction in the metastases, the compounds of the present invention are surprisingly more active than the reference compounds known in the state-of-the-art, both in the treatment of the Lewis lung carcinoma and, in a more evident and statistically significant manner, in the treatment of the MCa mammary carcinoma.<br><br>
