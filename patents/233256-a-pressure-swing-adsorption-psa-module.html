				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
MODULAR PRESSURE SWING ADSORPTION PROCESS AND APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes. PSA is<br>
a commonly used process for the purification of gases. Exemplary applications include<br>
separation of hydrogen from gas mixtures, separation of helium from natural gas, purification<br>
of landfill gas, and air separation for production of oxygen, nitrogen and/or argon.<br>
Discussion of the Background<br>
[0002] Many PSA systems are limited by their very large product and raffinate gas flow<br>
fluctuations. These fluctuations require sizeable storage or surge tanks to dampen the flow<br>
fluctuation adequately to allow proper function of downstream process equipment connected<br>
to the PSA system.<br>
[0003] Industrial-scale gas separations have traditionally been executed using PSA cycles<br>
possessing at least one pressure-equalizing step to enhance pressurized product fractional<br>
recovery at a given purity. In PSA cycles, increased fractional recovery decreases the amount<br>
of gas rejected to the raffinate surge tank, and ensures a more nearly continuous flow of<br>
pressurized product gas. Cycles having three or more equalizations are known. Another step<br>
taken to reduce flow pulsation in the art is to operate cycles having many equalizations and<br>
many vessels in a single process train. An example of a PSA system having many vessels<br>
and many equalization steps is U.S. Patent No. 3,986,849 to Fuderer, et al., which describes<br>
process trains possessing as many as ten adsorbent vessels and fifty-five valves. In industrial<br>
applications, the high energy and operating costs associated with loss of recoverable product<br>
has usually outweighed the considerable increase in complexity associated with more<br>
complex PSA cycles having one or more pressure equalizations, except for very large plants.<br>
Thus, most plants employ extremely large surge tanks for both pressurized product and<br>
raffinate gas.<br>
[0004] PSA systems of all types, but especially those having multiple equalizations, are<br>
also subject to severe limitations due to their very high complexity and attendant high parts<br>
count. Not only does this complexity significantly increase the probability of a component<br>
failure, it also significantly increases the system size, assembly time, and material cost. Most<br>
PSA systems are single point of failure systems, with notable exceptions being the processes<br>
revealed in U.S. Patent No. 4,234,322 to De Meyer et al. and U.S. Application Ser. No.<br>
10/269,064. Even in the exemplary processes, the PSA plant must eventually be shut-down<br>
to conduct maintenance on the defective component. Such shutdowns are extremely<br>
undesirable as they incur a significant amount of lost production time for the entire process<br>
facility. Further, when the PSA is connected to a high temperature process such as a<br>
hydrocarbon steam reformer, autothermal reformer, partial oxidation reformer, ammonia<br>
synthesis plant or ethylene cracker, the lifetime of the connected process equipment may be<br>
greatly reduced due to the high mechanical stresses incurred during a shutdown and restart<br>
event.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 6,051,050 to Keefer et al. describes systems using multiple rotary<br>
PSA modules in parallel in order to achieve greater overall system capacity, but fails to<br>
disclose a method or strategy for operating these modules in the event of a malfunction. The<br>
rotary modules of the Keefer et al. patent are quite different than those accepted in industrial<br>
practice, and are not subject to the same type of single point valve failure as valved PSA<br>
apparatuses. Their mode of failure is through gradual seal failure. The modules of the<br>
Keefer et al. patent also have a very large number of active beds, and they are thus less<br>
concerned with variations in product and raffinate gas flowrate pulsation. The low-pulsation<br>
rotary modules of the Keefer et al. patent and the similar inventions described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,112,367, U.S. Patent No. 5,268,021, and U.S. Patent No. 5,366,541 suffer from<br>
inevitable leakage due to their use of sliding seals. This leakage results in reduced purity and<br>
product recovery, as well as maintenance problems due to limited seal lifetime. High<br>
pressure exacerbates these problems, making rotary modules less desirable for industriallyimportant<br>
separations than typical valved PSA apparatuses.<br>
[0006] Because of the extremely large size of typical valved PSA systems and their very<br>
high cost it has remained extremely undesirable to provide backup PSA capacity to prevent<br>
process shutdowns, especially for valved PSA systems having pressure equalizations and<br>
large numbers of adsorbent beds, with their attendant high complexity.<br>
[0007] The inventors hereby incorporate by reference in their entirety an improved<br>
apparatus for advanced PSA systems that greatly reduces the complexity of the PSA<br>
apparatus employing pressure equalizations set forth in U.S. Application Ser. No.<br>
10/269,067, and methods for executing PSA cycles that dramatically reduce the number of<br>
valves required to execute PSA cycles set forth in U.S. Application Ser. No. 10/269,064.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] Accordingly, the present invention advantageously provides a valved pressure<br>
swing adsorption system with reduced flow pulsations.<br>
[0009] The pressure swing adsorption system of the present invention can be repaired while<br>
operating.<br>
[0010] The present invention further advantageously provides a pressure swing adsorption<br>
system with increased reliability.<br>
[0011] The present invention provides an apparatus for pressure swing adsorption systems<br>
that eliminates bending moments at the adsorbent vessel end connections.<br>
[0012] The present invention also advantageously provides a pressure swing adsorption<br>
apparatus with an integral structural cover.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the constituent elements having<br>
substantially the same function and arrangement are denoted by the same reference numerals,<br>
and repetitive descriptions will be made only when necessary.<br>
[0023] Figure 1 is a flow schematic for a PSA system 1 of the present invention having a<br>
pressurized feed gas manifold 2, a pressurized product manifold 3, and a low-pressure<br>
raffinate manifold 4. Product manifold 3 is provided with a product surge tank 5 while<br>
raffinate manifold 4 is provided with raffinate surge tank 6. In the process of the present<br>
invention, at least a first PSA module 10 and a second PSA module 20 are connected to the<br>
feed, product and raffinate manifolds. In the embodiment of Figure 1, eight PSA modules 10,<br>
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 are operated in parallel. Any number of parallel modules may<br>
be employed in the process of the present invention, and the choice of eight modules is<br>
adopted only as an example.<br>
[0024] The PSA modules are connected to the feed manifold 2 by their respective isolation<br>
valves 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, and 81. The PSA modules are connected to the product<br>
manifold 3 by their respective isolation valves 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, and 82. The PSA<br>
modules are connected to the raffinate manifold 4 by their respective valves 13, 23, 33, 43,<br>
53, 63, 73, and 83. When all of these valves are in their open positions, every PSA module is<br>
fluidly connected in parallel. Individual PSA modules may be isolated from the fluid<br>
manifolds by closing the valves connecting that module to the manifolds. For instance,<br>
module 20 may be isolated by closing valves 21, 22 and 23. Once a module is isolated, it is<br>
possible to conduct maintenance on that module while the rest of the installed modules are<br>
still in production. If module 20 was found to have a defective or malfunctioning component,<br>
it could be isolated from the PSA process manifolds 2, 3 and 4 by closing the valves 21, 22<br>
and 23, and then maintenance can be carried out. PSA modules 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80<br>
would continue to operate as usual. The maximum system capacity would be 7/8ths of the<br>
original capacity. This slight reduction in overall capacity may be addressed by operating the<br>
remaining PSA modules at a higher operating cycle frequency, or may be managed by<br>
designing additional capacity into the overall system such that no significant performance<br>
degradation is experienced when running at slightly elevated flowrate conditions.<br>
[0025] Figure 2 illustrates another advantage of the PSA process of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing low-pressure raffinate flowrate versus time for four different<br>
operating strategies for the PSA system 1 of Figure 1. These traces are for a threeequalization,<br>
seven bed PSA after the process of U.S. Application Set. No. 10/269,064, but<br>
the effect is similar for any PSA cycle. PSA cycles using less than three equalizations would<br>
show even more pronounced pulsation in the raffinate flowrate.<br>
(0026] If the PSA system is operated with every module synchronized to run their<br>
individual PSA cycles in phase, the flow pulsations are the same as operating a single process<br>
train, and the total flowrate varies between less than 1,000 units and over 17,000 units, a<br>
factor of 17:1. In the process of the present invention, the array of PSA modules is operated<br>
out of phase, such that periods of raffinate gas generation are offset from one another. In a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, the eight modules of the PSA system are operated<br>
in two groups of four, with each group operated 180 degrees out of phase with one another.<br>
Figure 2 shows that this results in the raffinate flowrate varying between roughly 1,500 and<br>
9,000 units. This is a ratio of about 6:1, which is nearly three times less than was the case<br>
with the prior art method of operating a single process train, or operating many modules both<br>
in parallel and in phase. In this first embodiment, each group uses half of the total available<br>
modules. For the example of an eight module system, this results in four groups of modules.<br>
If one module fails and must be isolated for repair, the system retains 7/8ths capacity, but the<br>
raffinate flowrate waveform would change due to the asymmetric nature of the two groups of<br>
vessels. The flowrate through the remaining three vessels in the group would be increased as<br>
much as 33% during some process steps, a factor which must be considered to prevent<br>
fluidization of the adsorbents and/or fluid shocks in the piping and/or valving systems.<br>
[0027] In alternative configuration of the present invention, the modules are separated into<br>
four groups and are each operated 90 degrees out of phase. Figure 2 shows that the resulting<br>
raffinate flowrate varies between about 2,000 and 6,000, a ratio of about 3:1. This is roughly<br>
half the flowrate variation experienced in the first embodiment where two groups of modules<br>
operate 180 degrees out of phase, and one sixth the variation of the prior art methods.<br>
Although this flowrate variation reduction is impressive, it reduces the number of modules<br>
per group to two for the example of an eight module system. If one module must be repaired,<br>
the change in flowrate for he other module in the group would be 100% during some cycle<br>
steps, a factor to be considered in designing the vessels and their interconnecting valves and<br>
flow conduits.<br>
[0028] In a further alternative configuration of the present invention, eight groups of<br>
modules are employed with their cycles offset by 45 degrees. This yields only a modest<br>
decrease in flowrate pulsation compared to four groups, and results in even larger changes in<br>
flowrate should a module require repair. In the example of the eight module system, each<br>
module would operate independently, for instance.<br>
[0029] Although even-numbered groups were described above and shown in Figure 2, odd<br>
numbers of groups are also feasible. In fact, any number of groups is feasible. Further, any<br>
number of modules can also be used to yield any number of modules per group. The<br>
embodiments discussed above assume that the groups operate 180, 90 and 45 degrees out of<br>
phase. For a given PSA cycle for each module, different phasing may be desirable to<br>
minimize flow variations of the product, the raffinate or both.<br>
[0030] It is preferable that each group have the same number of vessels in order to<br>
minimize flow variations for the entire system as well as flowrate variations through any<br>
given module in order to avoid the problems of adsorbent fluidization and fluid shocks. The<br>
balance between the number of groups and the number of modules per group must be<br>
optimized for each application of the present invention. In an application where minimized<br>
downtime for the connected equipment is the highest priority, a system with fewer groups<br>
each having a greater number of modules in parallel is preferred. In a system where<br>
reliability is of less importance than flowrate pulsation, a greater number of groups with<br>
fewer modules will be desired.<br>
[0031] Figure 3a illustrates a preferred apparatus for the PSA module of the present<br>
invention. The PSA module 100 has seven adsorbent chambers 101 arrayed between a feed<br>
manifold 102 and a product manifold 103. The pressurized adsorbent chambers are held in a<br>
fixed relationship with the manifolds via tie bolts 104. Both the feed and product manifolds<br>
are provided with a plurality of valves 105, which are used to execute the PSA cycle.<br>
[0032] The PSA module 100 illustrated in Figure 3a is an especially-preferred embodiment<br>
for executing the seven adsorbent vessel, three pressure equalization cycle described in U.S.<br>
Application Ser. No. 10/269,064. The apparatus of the present invention may also preferably<br>
be used to execute other cycles disclosed therein, as well as other PSA cycles of the related<br>
art.<br>
[0033] Side section view 3b shows a single adsorbent chamber 101 provided with an<br>
adsorbent mass 110. The adsorbent mass may be a single type of adsorbent, or may be made<br>
up of mixtures of adsorbent or distinct layers of adsorbent. The choice of adsorbent mass<br>
composition and size is dictated by the process flow conditions, the separation of interest and<br>
the PSA cycle, and does not limit the present invention in any way. The adsorbent chamber<br>
is sealingly connected to the inlet manifold 102 and the outlet manifold 103.<br>
[0034] Figure 4 shows an exploded section view of the adsorbent chamber and manifolds<br>
of Figure 3b. The adsorbent chamber 101 is advantageously mated to a sealing boss 111<br>
provided on both the inlet and outlet manifolds. These are shown as identical features in the<br>
figure, but may be differently shaped if desired. Each sealing boss is provided with at least<br>
one sealing member 112 which affects the fluid seal between the adsorbent chamber and the<br>
manifold. Although preferred internal radial sealing features are shown in Figure 4,<br>
compression seals or external radial seals may be provided. Neither the seals, nor the sealing<br>
boss affects a rigid structural joint between the manifolds and the adsorbent chamber.<br>
[0035] In PSA adsorbent chambers of the related art, the adsorbent chamber is fixed in<br>
rigid structural relation to an end flange feature or manifold. Such rigid connections<br>
undesirably give rise to localized bending stresses. Due to the cyclic nature of the stress state<br>
in a PSA apparatus, this bending moment can undesirably give rise to substantial problems<br>
with premature fatigue failure of the apparatus. Such premature failure is especially<br>
dramatically accelerated in the case of hydrogen PSA, as hydrogen embrittlement can affect<br>
many metallic construction materials. Thus, the non-structural sealing feature of the present<br>
invention is especially desirable as it facilitates the use of far thinner structural elements for<br>
equivalent fatigue life. Further, since the structural connection between the manifolds which<br>
resists the pressure forces is not in contact with the fluid being purified, high-strength<br>
materials which are otherwise particularly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement may be<br>
used. For instance, hardened steel may be used for the tie bolts 104, a material unacceptable<br>
in related art construction for hydrogen systems.<br>
[0036] Another advantage of the sealing apparatus of the present invention is that different<br>
materials may be used to manufacture the adsorbent chamber, manifolds and tie bolt features.<br>
Thus, a material that has good strength but little stiffness could be used for the adsorbent<br>
chambers, such as fiberglass-reinforced plastic, while a stiff material with less strength may<br>
be used for the manifolds, such as aluminum or closed-cell polymer foam. Finally, a third<br>
material can be used for the tie bolts. This freedom to optimize each material individually<br>
facilitates potentially dramatic decreases in weight and/or materials cost when required for a<br>
particular application.<br>
[0037] Figure 4 shows that the sealing bosses 111 are provided with a concave internal<br>
form to aid in flow distribution from the outlet and inlet radial flow distributors 113 and 114.<br>
These may be a separate component as shown in Figure 4, or may be formed integrally with<br>
the manifold. The radial flow distributor is in fluid communication with a fluid channel 115<br>
in the inlet manifold and fluid channel 116 in the outlet manifold. Flowing fluid from the<br>
channel 115 through the flow distributor 114 communicates with a chamber 120. The<br>
chamber is defined by the concave feature of the sealing boss as well as the adsorbent retainer<br>
plate 122, which is supported by a snap ring 123. The PSA apparatus of Figures 3 and 4 is<br>
shown for the case with the inlet manifold on the bottom of the apparatus and the outlet<br>
manifold on the top. If the apparatus is mounted in the opposite direction, the snap ring 123<br>
would be on the other side of the retainer plate.<br>
[0038] The retainer plate 122 may advantageously be supplied with a fine mesh layer 124<br>
to retain small diameter adsorbent particles. This mesh layer may be made from wire mesh,<br>
woven or non-woven polymer, glass or other fabric. The mesh layer 124 and the retainer<br>
plate 122 are preferably assembled with a radial seal ring 125 which holds them together for<br>
assembly and provides a radial seal to present bypassing of fluid or particles. Although this<br>
composite retainer assembly is preferred, other adsorbent support means may be used with<br>
equal success, such as metal, polymer or ceramic foams with an open structure, nonwoven<br>
mats, or other means apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0039] The outlet manifold is preferably supplied with a similar retainer plate assembly,<br>
except that the snap ring 123 is positioned to hold the retainer plate from above. It is most<br>
preferable to supply an elastic layer 130 between the upper retainer plate and the adsorbent.<br>
This elastic layer is then held in compression by the outlet end retainer plate assembly, and<br>
exerts a compressive load on the adsorbent mass 131. Preferred elastic materials also serve a<br>
filtration function to exclude fluidized dust particles from entering the manifolds. Examples<br>
of preferred materials are reticulated polymer foam, woven or non-woven elastomer mat, or<br>
elastomer-impregnated mat such as those made from natural fibers such as coconut fiber. If<br>
desired, an elastic element may also be provided at the inlet, or bottom end of the adsorbent<br>
chamber.<br>
[0040] The inlet manifold 102 is provided with a feed valve 135 and a waste valve 136.<br>
These valves mate with valve seats formed into the manifold. Inlet valve 135 communicates<br>
between parallel feed flow channel 137 and adsorbent chamber 101 through the channel 115<br>
and the radial flow distributor 114. Feed flow channel 137 communicates with all of the<br>
adsorbent chambers in the apparatus through their respective valves. It may be appreciated<br>
from Figure 4, which shows the valve 135 in its closed position, that flow through feed<br>
channel 137 between adsorbent chambers in the apparatus is not materially-impeded by the<br>
valve 135, whether it is in the open or closed position. This feature may be ensured by<br>
providing a flow channel 137 of sufficient cross-sectional area to ensure the ready flow<br>
through the channel, which is critical to the implementation of the PSA cycles of U.S.<br>
Application Ser. No. 10/269,064. The waste valve 136 likewise communicates with a<br>
parallel waste flow channel 138, which is in fluid communication with all of the adsorbent<br>
chambers 101 of the apparatus through their respective valves. The figures show a manifold<br>
that is machined, and the channel features 115 are formed by drilling. Thus, plugs 140 are<br>
provided to seal the ends of the channel 115. If the manifold is formed by a net shape process<br>
such as casting, plugs 140 are not required. Likewise, the pugs could be replaced with<br>
sensors, safety relief valves or other appurtenances. Further, the flow channels 115 and/or<br>
137 can be provided with additional features to provide connections for sensors, sample<br>
withdrawal, etc. The provision of such additional features does not limit the present<br>
invention in any way.<br>
[0041] The outlet manifold 103 is similarly provided with product valve 141, equalization<br>
valve 142 and equalization valve 143. These valves communicate with product conduit 144,<br>
first equalization conduit 145 and second equalization conduit 146. Each of these conduits is<br>
in fluid connection with each of the adsorbent chambers of the PSA apparatus through the<br>
respective valves for each chamber. The apparatus shown is for the especially-preferred PSA<br>
cycle with seven adsorbent vessels and three pressure equalizations of US app 10/269,064 by<br>
the present inventor. Other PSA cycles would use different numbers of valves and conduits.<br>
For instance, the six or five adsorbent chamber cycles of the above-named application would<br>
omit one of the equalization conduits and valves depicted in the figures for each adsorbent<br>
chamber.<br>
[0042] The equalization conduit 145 is additionally provided with porous flow restriction<br>
element 147 which is retained by retaining ring 148. Alternatively, the retaining ring may be<br>
used to secure a flow control orifice plate. Other elements such as check valves or flow<br>
control valves may also be provided. Such features may be provided only for one parallel<br>
flow channel as shown here, or for more than one channel.<br>
[0043] The apparatus depicted here uses preferred piston valves as described in U.S.<br>
Application Ser. No. 10/269,067 with air actuation. Alternatively, the valves may be<br>
solenoid operated, hydraulically-operated or mechanically-operated via a mechanical drive<br>
system such as a camshaft. The choice of valve actuation does not limit the present<br>
invention, and does not detract from the advantages thereof. Further, the apparatus depicted<br>
uses all valves of a single size. Valves of varying sizes and types maybe advantageously<br>
combined in the present apparatus to achieve desired combination of flow properties.<br>
Further, although the most-preferred apparatus employing parallel flow conduits is depicted,<br>
traditional PSA cycle not employing parallel flow conduits may also be executed by<br>
providing the required internal flow features.<br>
[0044] The manifolds of the present invention may be made by machining from solid stock,<br>
or by machining from a near net shape part made by casting or by joining together layers of<br>
material by brazing, soldering or adhesive bonding. Further, the manifolds may be made as a<br>
monolithic assembly, or be fashioned in a number of pieces held together by fasteners or<br>
other means and sealed by means of fluid seals such as gaskets. The choice of manufacturing<br>
technique does not limit the advantages of the present invention.<br>
[0045] Figure 5a shows a second embodiment of the PSA apparatus of the present<br>
invention. The tie rods of the first embodiment are omitted, and are replaced by structural<br>
panels 200 and 201. These panels are secured to the manifolds 102 and 103 by fasteners 202.<br>
An example of a preferred fastener being a machine screw, although other types of fasteners<br>
may be employed. Alternatively, the joining means between the structural panels and the<br>
manifolds may be via an adhesive bond, brazing, soldering or welding. Indeed, any loadbearing<br>
connection joining the manifolds to the structural panels may be advantageously<br>
used. This connection allows the pressure load separating the two manifolds to be borne by<br>
the structural panels in a state of substantially-pure tensile stress. Design of a flat panel in<br>
tension is straightforward, and common construction materials such as metallic or polymer<br>
sheet excel in bearing tensile load. The use of structural panels advantageously distributes<br>
the pressure load along the boundary of the manifolds, thus mitigating the local stresses<br>
engendered by the tie bolts 104 of the first embodiment.<br>
[0046] Figure 5a also shows similar panels 203 and 204 which serve as structural supports<br>
for the module. Again, these are advantageously mechanically-attached to the manifold using<br>
means that are adequate to support the mechanical loadings imposed by the module weight,<br>
as well as any additional loads posed by wind, seismic action, shipping loads, service loads,<br>
etc. Such structural panels may advantageously be provided with interconnecting features<br>
205 in order to create a stronger and stiffer support structure. Further, mounting features 206<br>
may be provided to allow secure connection between the support panels and the module<br>
foundation. Access cut-outs 207 may optionally be supplied in the support panels in order to<br>
facilitate maintenance and inspection of the valves. The module may also be advantageously<br>
provided with a top cover 208 which provides weather protection to the valves. This cover<br>
may be provided with valve actuation port 209 to permit installation of the required valve<br>
actuation means, whether they are pneumatic or electrical lines. Alternatively, the valve<br>
control apparatus may be advantageously located inside the valve cover 208, protected from<br>
the weather, hi this case, only a main electrical and/or pneumatic supply line would be<br>
required.<br>
[0047] Figure 5b shows an assembled view of the second embodiment of the PSA<br>
apparatus 210. It is readily apparent that if the structural panels of the present invention are<br>
applied on all sides of the module, they provide a substantial degree of protection against<br>
accidental damage to the adsorbent chambers. Such damage can easily occur during shipping<br>
and installation. The valves are also well-protected. It is, therefore, apparent that it may be<br>
advantageous in some situations to combine the panels of the second embodiment with the tie<br>
bolts of the first embodiment. A prime example being the case where local pressure vessel<br>
laws do not allow the structural panels of the present invention, but permit the tie bolts.<br>
Further, temporary panels whose only function is protection during shipment may be<br>
provided which attach using means similar to those used for the structural panels. For special<br>
applications where ease of access to the valves or adsorbent chambers is required, the PSA<br>
apparatus may be provided with panels on only two or three sides provided that the structural<br>
strength of the remaining panels is suitably increased.<br>
[0048] The panels of the PSA apparatus of the present invention advantageously reduce the<br>
complexity of assembly. They also facilitate a reduction in weight, as they reduce localized<br>
stresses associated with the tie bolts. These advantages are combined with improved<br>
shipping and handling durability, weather protection, and increased aesthetics compared to<br>
prior art methods.<br>
[0049] Figure 6 is a perspective view of the PSA system of the present invention<br>
implemented using the preferred PSA apparatus of the present invention. The elements<br>
described in Figure 1 are indicated by their numbers in Figure 6. The site footprint of the<br>
PSA system may be reduced significantly if no space is provided between the modules for<br>
maintenance access. Using the preferred apparatus, this may be accomplished as all<br>
maintenance tasks may be executed with access only to the top and bottom of the modules.<br>
The physical layout of the modules is not limiting, and any mechanical layout which<br>
accomplishes the fluid interconnections of the present invention will yield the special<br>
advantages of the present invention.<br>
[0050] The present invention provides numerous advantages. For example, the present<br>
invention provides a pressure swing adsorption apparatus that does not require fluid<br>
connectors between adsorbent vessels. Additionally, the present invention provides a<br>
pressure swing adsorption apparatus that does not require welding for construction. The<br>
present invention also provides a pressure swing adsorption apparatus that has minimal empty<br>
volume. Furthermore, the present invention provides a pressure swing adsorption apparatus<br>
that does not require structural support for the adsorbent vessels. While these structural<br>
advantages may be useful in certain circumstances, such structural features are not required<br>
by the present invention.<br>
[0051] It should be noted that the exemplary embodiments depicted and described herein<br>
set forth the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and are not meant to limit the<br>
scope of the claims hereto in any way.<br>
[0052] Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light<br>
of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended<br>
claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.<br><br><br><br>
