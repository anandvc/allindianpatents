This invention relates to a tamper-proof cap for a container   and   a   container   therefor.<br>
Containers for supplying goods such as potable water are provided with caps and it is desirable that such caps are made tamper-proof to eliminate adulteration between the point of manufacture and the point of supply to the consumer.<br>
This  invention  therefore proposes a  simple  and effective  tamper-proof cap for a container which can be readily installed in place to lock the  cap with the container, the lower portion of the cap, however,  being  manually tearable from  i ts  upper portion,  to leave the upper portion for  covering the mouth of the container.<br>
In order to enable to said lower portion of the cap to be manually torn away from its upper portion, it is preferred to have the cap made of a material which allows the 1atter portion to be torn away from the former. Thus, for instance, the cap can be made of piastic, for rendering the same  sufficiently  flexible to permit  the  lower<br><br>
portion to be torn of f , the  upper portion being sufficiently  rigid to be retained on the neck  of the container for covering its mouth.<br>
Since the cap, when once opened cannot be restored to its original locked condition, adulteration of the contents of the container is eliminated- At the same time unlocking the cap from the container is a simple procedure, at the user end, because all that one has to do is to manually grip a tag provided for the lower portion of the cap and tear the lower portion away from the upper portion. The latter portion of the cap can be used in the normal way for covering and uncovering the mouth of the container.<br>
Empty containers, after use, can be sent back to the pi ace of manufacture for being cleaned, refilled and fitted with fresh caps locked to the containers, which if opened, before they reach consumers, would indicate that they have been tampered with.<br>
Various  other  features of the  tamper-proof  cap<br><br>
and container proposed herein would be apparent from the following further description thereof given hereunder.<br>
According to this invention, the tamper-proof cap for a container comprises an upper portion snugly seatable on, and around, a raised perinietral boss provided on the exterior of the neck of the container; a lower portion having on its interior a perinietral ridge seatable in, and around, a waist provided on the exterior of the said neck, to form a tight snap-fit therewith and thus lock the cap to the container, said waist being located below the said boss; a manually grippable tag provided for the lower portion of the cap, for enabling the said lower portion to be manually torn off the upper portion, leaving the said upper portion in place, on and around, the said boss, for covering and uncovering the said mouth.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to an embodiment thereof which is illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings wherein<br><br>
Figs.l and 2 respectively illustrate the cap in top pi an view and in sectional elevation before the lower portion thereof is torn off<br>
Figs.3 and 4 respectively i1lustrate the cap in top pi an view and sectional elevation after the lower portion thereof is torn off<br>
Fig. 5 i1 lustrates the torn strip relating to the lower portion of the cap<br>
Fig,6 illustrates the view at AA in Fig.5<br>
Fig.7 illustrates the neck of the container without the cap<br>
Fig.8 illustrates the neck of the container with the cap locked in place<br>
and<br>
Fig.9 illustrates the neck of the container and the upper portion of the cap in place after the lower  portion  of  the cap  has  been  torn  off.<br>
The neck N <of the container d which is partially shown has a mouth at for dispensing></of><br>
contents of the said container,<br>
The said neck, on its exterior,	has a waist W<br>
surmounted by a raised boss B.	The  upper portion<br>
of  the  cap  C at U is snugly	seatable  on,  and<br>
around, the  boss B,<br>
The lower portion of the cap C at L, has on itÂ® interior, a perimetral ridge R seatable in, and around, the waist W, to lock the said cap to the container- The locking of the cap to the container is achieved by thrusting the cap over and down the neck of the container, until the ridge slips into the waist and forms a tight snap-fit therewith. Once so fitted, the cap is practically irremovable by reason of the snap-fit engagement between the ridge R and the waist W.<br>
The  said  lower  portion  of  the  cap,  on  its exterior,  is provided with a  manually  grippable tag  T for enabling the said lower portion  to  be manually  torn away from the said  upper  portion, thus leaving the said upper portion on, and around, the  said boss, to cover the mouth 0.<br><br>
To facilitate a firm manual grip, the tag is serrated at S.<br>
Preferably, the cap, on its interior, is provided with an annular plug for securely engaging with the mouth 0 and serving as a stopper.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, since various othe embodiments of this invention are possible within the scope and ambit thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A tamper-proof cap, for a container comprising an upper portion<br>
snugly seatable on, and around, a raised perimetral boss provided<br>
on the exterior of the neck of the container; a lower portion having<br>
on its interior a perimetral ridge seatable in, and around, a waist<br>
provided on the exterior of the said neck, to form a tight snap-fit<br>
therewith and thus lock the cap to the container, said waist being<br>
located below the said boss; a manually grippable tag provided for<br>
the lower portion of the cap, for enabling the said lower portion to<br>
be manually torn off the upper portion, leaving the said upper<br>
portion in place, on and around, the said boss, for covering and<br>
uncovering the said mouth.<br>
2.	A tamper-proof cap as claimed in Claim 1 wherein, on its interior,<br>
an annular plug is provided for securely engaging with the said<br>
mouth and serving as a stopper.<br>
3.	A tamper-proof cap for a container substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to and as illustrated by the accompanying<br>
drawings<br>
4.	A container for a tamper-proof cap as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the neck of the said container has a<br>
waist and a raised boss, the waist being located below the said<br>
boss.<br>
5.	A container as claimed in Claim 4 substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to and as illustrated by the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
