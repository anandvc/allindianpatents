Thiazole derivatives having CB-,-antagonistic, agonistic or partial agonistic activity<br>
The present invention relates to a group of thiazole derivatives, to methods for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an active component. The above mentioned thiazole derivatives are potent cannabinoid (CBi) receptor antagonists, CB5 receptor agonists or CBi receptor partial agonists, with utility for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders and other diseases involving cannabinoid CBi neurotransmission,<br>
4,5-Diarylthiazole derivatives have been described in EP 388909 and EP 377457 as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors for the treatment of thrombosis, hypertension, allergy and inflammation. The exemplified structures therein ail contain two phenyl rings which are p-substituted with a methoxy, fluoro, methylthio or methylsulfinyl group. WO 9603392 describes sulfonylaryl-arylthiazoles for inflammation and pain, arthritis or fever as inflammation-associated disorders.

A pro-drug is an inactive compound, which when absorbed is converted into an active form (Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, 1994, ISBN 0-85186-494-5, Ed.: F. D. King, p. 216).<br>
Due to the potent CBi receptor activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, cognttive_ disorders, appetite disorders, obesity, addiction, appetence, drug dependence and neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral apoplexy, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, neuroinfiammatory disorders, plaque sclerosis, viral encephalitis, demyelinisation related disorders, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders, including neuropathic pain disorders, and other diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, including the treatment of septic shock, glaucoma, cancer, diabetes, emesis, nausea, asthma, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers, diarrhoea and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB, receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB-, receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CBi receptor antagonistic, agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB-, receptors are stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CBi receptors by CB, receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55,940 or (R.)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB] receptor-mediated response can be antagonised by CB-i receptor antagonists or partial agonists such as the compounds of the invent!" ~<br><br>
Cannabinoid receptor agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention can be determined according to published methods, such as assessment of in vivo cannabimimetic effects (Wiley, J. L. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 296, 1013).<br>
Cannabinoid receptor antagonists may behave as inverse agonists (Landsman, R. S. etal., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 334, R1-R2).<br>
The invention relates both to racemates, mixtures of diastereomers and the individual stereoisomers of the compounds having formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br>
A suitable synthesis for the compounds according to the present invention is the following:<br>
Synthesis route A Step 1 of route A<br>

wherein R, R, and R2 have the meanings as described hereinabove.<br>
The compounds of the invention having formula (II), wherein R7 represents a branched or unbranched alkyl group (C,_4) or benzyl group can be obtained according to methods known, for example:<br><br>

Step 2 of route A<br>
Reaction of a compound having formula (III) with a compound having formula R3R4NH wherein R3 and R4 have the meanings as described hereinabove via activating and coupling methods such as formation of an active ester, or in the presence of a so-cailed coupling reagent, such as for example, DCC, HBTU, BOP, CiP (2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium hexafluorophosphate), PyAOP (7-azabenzotriazol-1-yioxytris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and the like. (For more information on activating and coupling methods see a) M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky: The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994; ISBN: 0-387-57505-7; b) K. Akaji et al.. Tetrahedron Lett. (1994), 35, 3315-3318; c) F. Albericio et al., Tetrahedron Lett. (1997), 38, 4853-4856).<br>
This reaction gives a desired thiazole derivative having formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula (III) is reacted with a so-called halogenating agent such as for example thionyl chloride (SOCI2). This reaction gives the corresponding carbonyl chloride (IV).<br><br>
Reaction of a compound having formula (IV) with a compound having formula R3R4NH wherein wherein R3 and R4 have the meanings as described hereinabove gives a thiazoie derivative having formula (I). This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic base such as for example diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) ortriethylamine.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula (II) is reacted in a so-called amidation reaction with a compound having formula R3R4NH wherein R3 and R4 have the meanings as described hereinabove to give a thiazole derivative having formula (I). Such amidation reactions can be promoted by the use of trimethylaluminum AI(CH3)3 (For more information on aluminum-mediated conversion of esters to amides, see: J. I. Levin, E. Turos, S. M. Weinreb, Synth Commun. (1982), 12, 989-993.)<br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula R3R4NH can be reacted with a strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS), potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) or sodium hexamethyldisilazide (NaHMDS) and the like to give in situ a compound having formula R3R4NLi, R3R4NK or R3R4NNa, respectively, which can then be reacted with a compound having formula (li) to give a thiazole derivative having formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula (I) wherein R3 and R4 represent a hydrogen atom can be reacted with a strong base, such as LDA, LiHMDS, NaH and the like, followed by a reaction with a compound L-R4 wherein L represents a so-called leaving group such as Br, CI, I and the like, and R4 represents a branched or unbranched CH0 aikyl group, cycloalkyl-alkyl group or a branched or unbranched C3_10 alkenyl group, which groups ma^ contain one or more heteroatoms from the group (O, N, S) and which groups may be substituted with 1-3 methyl groups, an ethyl group or 1-3 fluoro atoms.<br>
