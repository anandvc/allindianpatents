				<td>BIS(THIO-HYDRAZE)E AMIDE) FORMULATION<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit ofU.S. Provisional Application No. 60/708,977, filed on August 16,2005. The entire teachings of the above application(s) are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many drugs are now available to be used in the treatment of cancer. However, in many cases the cancer fails to respond to the anti-cancer therapy or its growth and/or metastasis is only slowed. Even when a tumor initially responds to an anti-cancer therapy by decreasing in size or going into remission, the tumor often develops resistance to the drug. For these reasons, there has been a need for new anti-cancer agents and for new drugs which can be used to treat multi-drug resistance cancers.<br>
Certain bis(thio-hydrazide amide) compounds have been described as being significantly cytotoxic to cancer cells, including cancer cells that have become multi-drug resistant, and for enhancing the anti-cancer activity of other anti-cancer agents, such as taxol and taxol analogs (see, e.g., U.S. Application No 10/758589, and US Patent Nos. 6,762,204, and 6,800,660, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
These bis(thio-hydrazide amide) are themselves only marginally soluble in water. However, their disalts (as disclosed in US Application No. 11/157,213, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference) show high water solubility and bioavailability. Typically these disalts suffer from long reconstitution<br><br>
times in water, and due to a low glass transition temperature these disalts require specialized lyophilization equipment which increases costs associated with drying these disalts.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for methods which decrease costs associated with drying these disalts and which shorten the reconstitution times of the disalts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that reconstitution times for certain bis(thio-hydrazide amide) disalts can be decreased considerably by lyopbilizing and annealing the disalts in the presence of a crystalline bulking excipient under certain conditions. It has also been found that by lyophilizing and annealing these disalts in the presence of a crystalline bulking excipient, specialized lyophilized equipment is not required, and therefore manufacturing costs are considerably reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising a bis(thio-hydrazide amide) compound which is a compound whose structure is encompassed by a formula selected from Structural Formulas (I)- (V), as described below, 2 g of which is reconstitutable in 10 mL in less than 10 minutes; preferably in less than 5 minutes, more preferably less than 2 minutes, even more preferably less than 1 minute, still more preferably, less than 30 seconds.<br>
The terms "reconstitutable" or "reconstituted" as defined herein means that the composition or annealed composition and/or lyophilized composition of the present invention can be dissolved completely in water under ambient conditions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used herein refers to a substance which is added to a solution prior to lyophilization to enhance characteristics such as the color, texture, strength, and volume of the lyophilized cake. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be, for example, buffers and pH adjusters, crystalline bulking excipients, stabilizers, and tonicity raising agents.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is a crystalline bulking excipient. The terms "crystalline bulking excipient" or "crystalline bulking agent" as used herein means an excipient which provides bulk and structure to the lyophilization cake. These crystalline bulking agents are inert and do not react with the bis(thio-hydrazide amide). In addition, the crystalline bulking agents are capable of crystallizing under lyophilization conditions. The crystalline bulking agent may form a crystal structure combined with the bis(thio-hydrazide amide), or may form a crystal structure independent of the bis(thio-hydrazide amide).<br>
Examples of suitable crystalline bulking agents include hydrophilic excipients, such as, water soluble polymers; sugars, such as mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, glucitol, ducitol, inositiol, arabinitol, arabitol, galactitol., iditol, allitol, maltitol, fructose, sorbose, glucose, xylose, trehalose, allose, dextrose, altrose, lactose, glucose, fructose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, lactulose, fucose, rhamnose, melezitose,<br>

Preferred crystalline bulking agents are selected from the group consisting of glycine, mannitol, dextran, dextrose, lactose, sucrose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, trehalose, glucose and combinations thereof. Other preferred crystalline bulking agent are glycine or mannitol. In certain other preferred embodiments, the crystalline bulking agent is mannitol.<br>
In certain embodiments the crystalline bulking agents is present in a molar ratio of bis (thio-hydrazide amides) relative to the excipient of 1:20 to 1:1, preferably 1:10 to 1:1. Typically, the excipients are present in a molar ratio excess of the bis (thio-hydrazide amide) disalt to the excipients of, for example, from, 1:20 to 1:2, preferably from 1:10 to 1:2, even more preferably from 1:5.5 to 1:2.0.<br>
In other embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can be used in combination with the bis(thio-hydrazide amide) wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient forms a gelatin or polymer structure which can be amorphous or crystalline. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include hydroxyethyl starch, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, pullan, starch, pectin, amylopectin, chitin and combinations thereof, preferably the excipient is selected from hydroxyethyl starch, dextran and combinations thereof. Typically these excipient are present in a weight ratio of the bis (thio-hydrazide amide) to the excipient of from 1:0.5 to 1:20 preferably from 1:1 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:1 to 1:5, even more preferably from 1:1 to 1:2.<br>
For one embodiment, the composition comprising the bis(thio-hydrazide amide), and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, is a lyophilized, more preferably a lyophilized and annealed composition. Alternatively, the disclosed compositions are lyophilized or unlyophilized. When unlyophilized these<br>
compositions can be starting materials used to prepare the lyophilized and annealed compositions of the invention by means of the processes described below.<br>
The term "lyophilization" as used herein is a freeze drying or dehydration technique which involves removing a solvent, preferably a water miscible solvent, more preferably water from a composition, typically by sublimation under high vacuum when the composition is in a frozen state. Lyophilization stabilizes the composition and minimizes oxidation and other degradative processes allowing for long term storage of the composition at temperatures above freezing.<br>
The terms "lyophilized composition", "lyophilized cake" or "lyophilizate" as used herein mean the solid residue or cake which is produced or which remains after the lyophilization procedure as defined above. In certain embodiments, the lyophilized formulation or lyophilizate has a moisture content of less than 10 %, preferabty less than 5 %, .more preferably less than 2 %, even more preferably less than 1 %. The final moisture of a lyophilized formulation, can be measured by Karl Fisher or other methods.<br>
Typically, lyophilization is carried out ha lyophilization equipment (a lyophillizer), which comprises a drying chamber with variable temperature controls, a condenser to collect water, and a vacuum system to reduce the pressure in the drying chamber.<br>
The lyophilization process generally includes two steps: a freezing step and a . primary drying or sublimation step, and can optionally include a secondary drying step. The lyophilization process may also include a pretreatment stage, carried out prior to the freezing stage and an annealing stage carried out during prior to the drying stage.<br>
As used herein "pretreatment" includes any method of treating the composition or solution prior to freezing. This may include, for example, concentrating the solution, formulation revision (i.e., addition of components to increase stability and/or improve processing), or pre-cooling the solution.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments the composition or solution is precooled at between 10 °C and -10 °C, preferably, between 0 °C and -10 °C., over a time period of between 10 seconds and 1 hour, preferably between 1 minute and 30 minutes.<br><br>
To prepare the disclosed reconstitutable compositions, a bis (thiohydrazide amide) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent, preferably the bis(thio-hydrazide amide) and the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient are dissolved in a suitable solvent to form a solution. Typically, the solvent is an aqueous solvent and can optionally comprise other ingredients such as buffers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients dissolved therein. Typically, the solvent is sterile water with no. other ingredients. Alternatively, the solvent is a non-aqueous solvent, such as, an alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, tort-butyl alcohol or a water/alcohol mixture, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrafuran (THF), or dimethylformamide (DMF).<br>
The first stage of the disclosed lyophilization process, after any pre-treatment steps, is freezing, hi the freezing step, the solution is frozen at a temperature below the glass transition temperature of the bis (thio-hydrazide amide) to form a freeze-concentrate.<br>
Glass transition temperature (Tg), as defined herein is the temperature at which a compound changes state from that of a glassy rigid state to that of a viscous liquid. For example, below the Tg materials are typically rigid or glassy, and typically are rubbery or leathery above the Tg. The glass transition is not always a sharp transition and in certain instances can be a gradual transition. For the bis (thio-hydrazide amide of Structural Formula, (II) the Tg is -44.7 °C.<br>
As the solution freezes the concentration of the compound and excipient increases ha solution, Tg' is the glass transition temperature at the maximum concentration of drug and excipient in solution.<br>
Freezing produces a "freeze concentrate" of a highly concentrated, composition or mixture consisting of the compound of the present invention and excipient or excipients interlaced in the interstitial region of the ice crystals.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, in the freeing step the solution is frozen at a temperature between -44.7 °C and -80 °C, preferably, between -44.7 °C and -60 °C, preferably between -44.7 °C and -50 CC. over a time period of between 10 minutes and 10 hours, preferably between 30 minutes and 3 hours, more preferably, between 30 minutes and 2 hours.<br>
In.the next step of the disclosed lyophilization procedure, the "freeze-concentrate" is optionally annealed. The terms "annealed" or "annealing" as used herein is a process of holding the temperature of the freeze-concentrate at a constant temperature for a duration of time that allows the crystalline bulking excipient to crystallize. Typically, the freeze-concentrate is annealed at a temperature between the melting point of the frozen solution comprising the freeze-concentrate, and the Tg of the compound of the present invention. The melting point of the frozen solution comprising the freeze-concentrate as used herein is the temperature at which the frozen solution comprising the bis (tbio-hydrazide amide) and excipient changes from a solid frozen state to a liquid state or starts to melt. Typically this temperature is around 0 °C but will vary depending on the concentration of the solution. When the freeze-concentrate of the present invention are annealed, the crystalline bulking excipient forms a crystal structure independent of the compound of the present invention.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the annealing step is carried out once. In certain more preferred embodiment, the annealing step is carried out more than once, such as twice, three times, five times or ten times. Typically, the annealing step is carried out twice.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, in the annealing step the freeze-concentrate is annealed at a temperature between 0 °C and -44.7 °C, preferably, between 0 °C and -40 °C and, preferably between 0 °C and -30 °C over a time period of between 10 minutes and 10 hours, preferably between 2 hours and 6 hours, more preferably, between 3 hours and 5 hours.<br>
The term "annealed composition" as used herein is any composition which has been annealed as defined above.<br>
In the next step in the disclosed lyophilization procedure, the annealed composition can be frozen to a temperature below the Tg of the bis (thio-hydrazide amide). In this freeing step, the solution is frozen at a temperature between -44.7 °C and -80 °C, preferably, between -44.7 °C and -60 °C, preferably between 44.7 °C and -50 °C over a time period of between 10 minutes and 10 hours, preferably between 30 minutes and 3 hours, more preferably, between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours.<br>
The term "drying" as used herein encompasses any method of removing water or solvent from the freeze-concentrate or annealed composition while maintaining the glassy state of the freeze-concentrate or annealed composition.<br>
The primary drying step involves the sublimation of the aqueous solution or solvent components under a vacuum at temperatures low enough to prevent collapse of the freeze-concentrate. hi certain particular embodiments, the aqueous or solvent components are removed by sublimation during primary drying. The temperature of the drying step must be high enough to provide a sufficient rate of sublimation of the liquid components yet low enough to insure that all components of the freeze-concentrate remain frozen. Since sublimation provides considerable cooling to the product, temperatures for the drying step are generally much higher than those for the freezing step.<br>
In the primary drying step the freeze-concentrate or annealed composition is dried by sublimation at a temperature between 20 °C and -20 °C, preferably, between 10 °C and -10 °C, preferably between 10 °C and 0 °C additional sublimation temperatures include between 0 °C and -30 °C, preferably between 0 °C and -25 °C. Typically sublimation is carried out under vacuum conditions at pressures of between 200 mTorr and 20 mTorr, preferably between 200 mTorr and 100 mTorr, more preferable, between 180 mTorr and 130 mTorr.<br>
Sublimation is carried out over a time period of between 5 hours and 40 hours, preferably between 10 hours and 30 hours, more preferably, between 20 hours and 30 hours, additionally sublimation is carried out over a time period of between 10 hours and 80 hours, preferably between 30 hours and 60 hours.<br>
After removal of the ice crystals by sublimation, the remaining freeze-concentrate or annealed composition may still contain bound water/solvent that may be removed by slow heating which is optionally conducted under vacuum conditions to produce the lyophilized cake. This is the final segment of the lyophilization cycle where residual moisture is reduced to levels that no longer support biological growth and chemical reaction. This process is secondary drying. The reduction of moisture in during secondary drying is accomplished by increasing the temperature to ambient temperature or above.<br>
In the secondary drying step the freeze-concentrate or annealed composition is dried by desorption at a temperature between 20 °C and 80 °C, preferably, between 30 °C and 60 °C, preferably between 40 °C and 50 °C additional desorption temperatures include 10 °C to 80, preferably, 10 °C to 30 °C. Typically desorption is carried out under vacuum conditions at pressures of between 200 mTorr and 20 mTorr, preferably between 200 mTorr and 100 mTorr, more preferable, between 180 mTorr and 130 mTorr.<br>
In a particular embodiment, desorption is carried out over a time period of<br>
between 10 minutes and 10 hours, preferably between 30 minutes and 5 hours, more<br>
preferably, between 1 hour and 3 hours, additional desorption times include 10 to 30<br>
hours, preferably 10 to 20 hours.	,<br>
The lyophilized formulation or lyophilizate.is typically dried until it has a moisture content of less than 10 %, preferably less than 5 %, more preferably less than 2 %, even more preferably less than 1 %. The final moisture of a lyophilized formulation, can be measured by Karl Fisher or other methods.<br>

In another embodiment., the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective against T-leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by Jurkat and CEM cell lines); B-leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the SB cell line); promyelocytes (e.g., as exemplified by the HL-60 cell line); uterine sarcoma (e.g., as exemplified by the MES-SA cell line); monocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the THP-1 (acute) cell line); and lymphoma (e.g., as exemplified by the U937 cell line); most preferably, this embodiment of the method employs the disodium salt of Compound (1).<br>
The disclosed method is particularly effective at treating subjects whose cancer has become "multi-drug resistant". A cancer which initially responded to an anti-cancer drug becomes resistant to the anti-cancer drug when the anti-cancer drug is no longer effective in treating the subject with the cancer. For example, many tumors will initially respond to treatment with an anti-cancer drug by decreasing in size or even going into remission, only to develop resistance to the drug. Drug resistant tumors are characterized by a resumption of their growth and/or reappearance after having seemingly gone into remission, despite the administration of increased dosages of the anti-cancer drug. Cancers that have developed resistance to two or more anti-cancer drugs are said to be "multi-drug resistant". For example, it is common for cancers to become resistant to three or more anti-cancer agents, often five or more anti-cancer agents and at times ten or more anti-cancer agents.<br>

Taxol, also referred to as "Paclitaxel", is a well-known anti-cancer drug which acts by enhancing and stabilizing microtubule formation. Many analogs of taxol are known, including taxotere. Taxotere is also referred to as "Docetaxol". The structures of other taxol analogs are shown in US Application No. 11/157,213 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These compounds have the basic taxane skeleton as a common structure feature and have also been shown to have the ability to arrest cells in the G2-M phases due to stabilization of microtubules. Thus, a wide variety of substituents can decorate the taxane skeleton without adversely affecting biological activity. It is also apparent that zero, one or both of the cyclohexane rings of a taxol analog can have a double bond at the indicated positions. For clarity purposes, the basic taxane skeleton is shown below in Structural Formula (VI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 (VI). Double bonds have been omitted from the cyclohexane rings in the taxane skeleton<br>
represented by Structural Formula (VI). The basic taxane skeleton can include zero or one double bond in one or both cyclohexane rings, as indicated in Structural Formulas (VII) and (VET) below. A number of atoms have also been omitted from Structural Formula (VI) to indicate sites in which structural variation commonly occurs among taxol analogs. For example, substitution on the taxane skeleton with simply an oxygen atom indicates that hydroxyl, acyl, alkoxy or another oxygen-bearing substituent is commonly found at the site. These and other substitutions on the taxane skeleton can be made without losing the ability to enhance and stabilize microtubule formation. Thus, the term "taxol analog" is defined herein to mean a compound which has the basic taxol skeleton and which promotes microtubule formation. Taxol analogs may be formulated as a nanoparticle colloidal composition to improve the infusion time and to eliminate the need to deliver the drug with Cremophor which causes hypersensitivity reactions in some patients. An example of a taxol analog formulated as a nanoparticle colloidal composition is AB1-007 which is a nanoparticle colloidal composition of protein-stabilized paclitaxel that is reconstituted in saline.<br>

EXEMPLIFICATION<br>
Example 1 Development of freeze-drying parameters<br>
The freeze-dryer shelf was cooled at 0.1 °C/min, .0.2 °C/min, 0.4 °C/mm, 1.0 "C/min, and by rapidly freezing the vials in a -80 °C freezer. The worst looking cakes were produced when the product was frozen in the -80 °C freezer. This thermal treatment yielded a separated layer at the top of the sample referred t© as "flake" throughout this study. Flake formation can be likely explained by a much higher resistance of the upper portion of the cake to a gas flow when compared to the material making up the remainder of the cake. A thinner flake separated from the top of the dried cake when the shelves were cooled at 1 °C/min. No flaking was seen using the optimized formulation (as dried using parameters outlined in Table 1) when the shelves were cooled at a rate of 0.1 °C/min, 0.2 °C/min) or 0.4 DC/min. Of note is the fact that other variables were changed when fhe cooling rate was slowed (e.g., the heating rate during primary drying).<br>
An annealing step was included in order to induce mannitol crystallization and control the size of the crystals. Two annealing temperatures, -8 °C and -20 °C, were tested. In addition, the effect of annealing time and number of annealing<br>
cycles on the mannitol crystallization and cake appearance were evaluated. The final temperature chosen for annealing was -20 °C. Freeze-drying cycles were performed using one or two annealing steps. The cycles utilizing two annealing steps produced a more elegant cake.<br>
Primaiy drying was performed at shelf temperatures ranging from -10 °C to 10 °C (correlating to product temperatures of-34 °C to -24 °C at the beginning of primary drying). Primary drying at a shelf temperature of-10 °C required a very long drying time (the product temperature was still 12 °C below the shelf temperature after 17 hours). Shelf temperatures above 5 °C during primary drying led to a meltback on the bottom layer of the vial. A shelf temperature of 5 °C was chosen as the final primary drying temperature. In order to prevent heating the sample too quickly, a slow heating ramp from -48 °C to -15 °C at 0.5 °C/min, and irom -15 °C to 5 °C at 0.1 °C/min was introduced. Cake flaking ceased to be a problem in the chosen formulation after the initial cooling rate and the primary drying heating rate were lowered. Additional studies would be necessary to fully differentiate between the effects of these two parameters, but the visual observation of the flake formation just at the beginning of the primary drying cycle when the formulations were cooled more rapidly suggests the importance of the appropriate cooling rate in preventing phase separation of the product.<br>
Secondary drying consisted of a ramp from 5 °C to 45 °C, and a holding step at 45 °C. 45 °C was chosen because performing secondary drying at that temperature would convert mannitol hydrate into anhydrous mannitol. The final temperature ramp rate chosen was 1 °C/min, with the holding step lasting 3 hours.<br>
The recommended freeze-drying cycle chosen for this product is shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Recommended freeze-drying cycle.<br>

DSC analysis was performed in order to characterize the temperatures of the glass transition of disodium l-Q^'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-!-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate formulations. The Tg' of approximately -34 °C was detected for a formulation containing 55 mg/ml disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-tMobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate and 11 % (w/v) mannitol when no annealing step was introduced into a thermal treatment No Tg' was observed following an annealing step at -8 °C for one hour. The goal of annealing is to crystallize the mannitol in the formulation. The absence of a Tg' (characteristic for amorphous mannitol) in the formulations that underwent an annealing step demonstrated that the annealing was sufficient for mannitol crystallization.<br>
DSC analysis was also performed for the freeze-dried samples in order to determine the Tg' and confirm the absence of mannitol hydrate. The concentration of mannitol hydrate can be estimated based on its characteristic endothermic melting at 80 °C. The Tg' of the freeze-dried disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thioben2oyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate-mannitol formulation was approximately 56 °C. No mannitol hydrate melts were observed in the dried product, indicating that the secondary drying step was sufficient in converting the metastable mannitol hydrate to an anhydrous form of mannitol. Also,<br>
no crystallization exotherms were detected in the thermal scans, showing that the manriitol crystallized during the freezing and annealing processes.<br>
In freeze-dried products, 1% (w/w) residual moisture is considered to be a characteristic for completely dried product. In order to estimate the secondary drying time required to obtain a product with the moisture level below 1 % the formulations were pulled out from freeze-drier during different timepoints of secondary drying using sample thief. The secondary drying step of the final cycle (a 45 °C shelf temperature for 3 hours) was adequate for achieving a dry product. The final freeze-drying cycle chosen for this study produced a product with 0.9 % residual moisture.<br>
The stability of disodium 2-(N' -methyl-N' -thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate during freeze-drying was evaluated via reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazmocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate proved to be stable through all of the freeze-drying cycles tested, as no degradation products were detected. On average, main peak purity of 97% was observed for disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbon3'l)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate than the cake body.<br>
The flakes that were produced in many of the freeze-drying runs were tested for potency, and compared to the cake body. Equal weights of both were reconstituted in the same volume of deionized water. This analysis indicated that the flake contains a higher concentration of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate than the cake body. This could be due to a slight phase separation during freezing. The separation does not appear to affect the stability of the product.<br>
RP-HPLC analysis showed that the freeze-drying process used in this study did not adversely affect the stability of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazmocarbonyl)-1 -(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate,<br>
The osmolality of the freeze-dried product (55.5mg/mL disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate and 11 % mannitol) was assessed following reconstitution in water for injection (WFI), 0.9%(w/v) Nad in WFI, or 5%(w/v) dextrose in WFL The<br><br>
osnaolality following reconstitution with 10 mL of solvent, as well as after dilution to 150 mL was measured. After dilution to 150 mL with either the NaCl or dextrose solutions, the product is in the range of isotonicity.<br>
Example 2 freeze drying of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-tbiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate and choice of excipients, fill volumes and vial size<br>
Freeze-drying was performed in a Genesis 25EL freeze-dryer (Virtis). Sample vials were placed directly on the shelf. Space leftover on the shelf was rilled with empty vials." The vial headspace was filled with air. Tg' and Tg were evaluated using a PYRIS Diamond DSC. Samples for Tg' determination were prepared by loading 50uL of sample into a 50uL aluminum pan, then sealing the, pan using the sealing press. The thermal program used to identify Tg' (without annealing) was:<br>
1.	Ramp from 20oC to -50oC at lOoC/min<br>
2.	Hold at -50oC for 4 minutes<br>
3.	Ramp from -50oC to 20oC at 1 OoC/min<br>
The thermal program used to identify Tg' that included an annealing step was:<br>
1.	Ramp from 20 °C to -45 °C at 10 °C/min<br>
2.	Hold at -45 °C for 10 minutes<br>
3.	Ramp from -45 °C to -8 °C at 10 °C/min<br>
4.	Hold at -8 °C for 1 hour<br>
5.	Ramp from -8 °C to -70 °C at 10 °C/min<br>
6.	Hold at -70 °C for 5 minutes<br>
7.	Ramp from -70 °C to 20 °C at 10 °C/min<br>
Tg' was taken to be the midpoint of the transition.<br>
Freeze-dried samples used in the determination of Tg' were prepared by weighing out a few milligrams of sample into a 50 J4.L aluminum pan and sealing it. The thermal program used to determine Tg' ramped the temperature from 25 °C to 150°CatlO°C/min.<br>
Residual moisture was analyzed using the Karl Fisher. The dried samples were reconstituted with methanol. The vials containing samples were weighed. The sample was injected into the coulometer, and the water content was measured. The sample vial was then weighed to determine the amount of sample added to the coulometer. The percentage of water in the sample could then be determined.<br>
Reverse phase HPLC was used to quantify the potency and purity of; disod^um2-(N'-methyl-N'-miobenzoyl-hydra2inocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-tiiiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate following freeze-drying. The analysis was performed as detailed in the analytical method,<br>
Osmolality of a formulation containing 55.5mg/mL; disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-1 -(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate and 11 %(w/v) mannitol was tested after reconstitution in water for injection (WFI), 0.9% NaCl in WFI, or 5% dextrose in WFI. An Osmette XL was used to measure the osmolality after reconstitution in 10 mL of solvent as well as after dilution to 150 mL. Osmolality measurements were also made of the solvents.<br>
The crystalline bulking agents that were explored for use in the freeze-dried formulation were mannitol and glycine. Formulations containing 55.5 mg/mL and either 1:1,2.5:1,4:1, or 5:1 molar ratios of mannitol:disodium2-(N'-methyl-N!-1i3iobenzoyl-hydrazmocarbonyl)-l-(memyl-1iiiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolateor 0.5:1, 1:1, or 2.5:1 molar ratios of glycine:disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate were used in the initial formulation development experiments.<br>
Formulations with 1:1 and 2.5:1 mannitol:disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate resulted in phase separation and some collapse upon freeze-drying. While both 4:1 and 5:1 mannitol:disodium2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-b.ydrazmocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate formulations produced rugged cakes,<br><br>
the 5:1 formulation formed the more pharmaceutically elegant cake. A very thin flake did separate from the tops of the cakes in these two formulations.<br>
For the glycine containing formulations, the 0.5:1 glycinerdisodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-tMoben2oyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate samples displayed significant shrinkage and some collapse. The 2.5:1 glycin.e:disodium2-(N-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate formulations produced elegant cakes but did not reconstitute completely. Although 1:1 glycine: disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N' -thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-tliiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate samples produced elegant cakes on first appearance, vigorous shaking reduced them to a powder.<br>
Based on these results, mannitol was selected for further development studies. The 5:1 mannitol:disodium2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocafbonyl)-1 -(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate formulation equated to an ll%(w/v) mannitol solution for 55 mg/mL disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-lMobenzoyl-hydra2inocarboriyl)-l-(methyl-thioben2oyl-hydra2ono)-ethaiiolate solution, and this was used as the starting point for the next round of formulation studies.<br>
Using an 11 %(w/v) mannitol solution, the concentration of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate was'varied at 42mg/mL, 55.5mg/mL, and 83mg/mL in order to test the effects of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-tniobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate concentration on the properties of freeze-dried cake. All of the formulations produced pharmaceutically elegant cakes with a thin flake separating from the top in most cases. The reconstitution time of the 83mg/mL formulation was almost 3 minutes, which is undesirably long. The other formulations reconstituted in about 20 seconds. A formulation with 67 mg/mL disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate with 11% mannitol of was also evaluated, and produced an elegant cake that reconstituted in about 20 seconds.<br>
After narrowing down the type and concentrations of excipients and disodium 2-(N'-merayl-N'-1iiiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thioben2oyl-<br><br>
hydrazono)-ethanolate, a more focused study, varying mannitol and disodiurn 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate concentrations over a smaller range was performed. The main goal of this study was to determine the concentrations of mannitol and disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-tliiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono}-ethanolate that would create the most pharmaceutically elegant cake. The vial size was also varied in these studies, using 20mL and 50mL lyophilization vials. The formulations used in this study are listed in Table 2.<br>
Table 2. Formulations used in formulation study.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Formulations 8 and 9 turned to a powder upon shaking. Formulations 4 and 5 failed to produce rugged cakes. The other formulations did produce rugged cakes. Flaking was present in many of the vials, but formulations 1 and 6 showed less flaking than the other formulations.<br><br>
Further studies were performed using formulations 1, 2, 6, and a formulation with 67mg/ml disodium 2-(N' -methyl-N' -thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-1-(metliyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethaiiolate and 14% mannitol (formulation 10) with a freeze-drying cycle as outlined in Table 1 in an attempt to minimize flaking. Both formulations 1 and 2 resulted in pharmaceutically acceptable cake that did not exhibit any flaking, however formulation 2 produced the more elegant cake .<br>
The results of the formulation work performed on this project resulted in an optimal freeze-dried (as outlined in Table 1) disodium 2-(N' -methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-1 -(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate formulation consisting of 55.5 mg/mL disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazin6caibonyl)-l-(niethyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate with 1 l%(w/v) mannitol in water for injection. The pH for this formulation is around 10.9, This formulation, along with a optimized freeze-drying cycle as outlined in Table 1 will result in a rugged and pharmaceutically elegant product. By filling 20 mL vials with 12 mL of 55.5 mg/mL disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate, the desired dose of 670 mg disodium 2-(N '-methyl-N' -thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-1 -(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate can be delivered in a single vial which provides additional economical advantage to this formulation.<br>
Example 3<br>
In a glass beaker 160g of purified water was heated to approximately 65 °C. 9.06g of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) was slowly added to the water and mixed. Mixing was continued until the HES dissolved (less than 10 minutes). The solution was cooled to room temperature and then 11.70g of disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobeiTZoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-l-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate was added. This was mixed until all the disodium 2-(N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoyl-hydrazinocarbonyl)-1-(methyl-thiobenzoyl-hydrazono)-ethanolate was in solution (less than 10 minutes). All the solution was quantitatively transferred to a 200 mL volumetric flask and diluted to 200 mL with purified water. The final unit formulation was 55.5mg/ml STA-4783 sodium and 45 mg/ml HES.<br><br>
8.0 roL of the solution was filled into 20 mL Type I glass vials. Freeze-dry stoppers were placed on the filled vials, which were then loaded into the freeze-dryer. The freeze-drying cycle was as follows in Table 3:<br>
