Cationic Electrodeposition Paint Compositions<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to cationic electrodeposition paint compositions containing as the resin component amino group-containing modified epoxy resin excelling in water dispersibility.   In particular, the invention relates to cationic electrodeposition paint compositions which, even when the quantity of volatile organic compound in cationic electrocoating bath is reduced, still exhibits excellent film thickness retention, finished appearance of coating film and electrocoatability on galvanized alloy steel sheet and can form coating film of good corrosion resistance, and also to the coated articles for which the compositions are used.<br>
Background art<br>
Cationic electrodeposition paint compositions excel in coating workability, and films formed thereof exhibit good corrosion resistance.    Hence they are widely used as undercoat of electrically conductive metallic articles such as car bodies which require these    properties.<br>
Base resins which are used in cationic electrodeposition paint compositions normally are produced using organic solvent, and are blended in the form of organic solvent-containing resin solutions (varnishes).    Resulting cationic electrodeposition paint compositions,      therefore, become organic solvent-containing paint compositions.<br>
Cationic electrodeposition paint compositions also are usually blended with organic solvent of good hydrophihcity/hydrophobicity balance, such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (boiling point, 171°C), ethylene glycol monohexyl ether (boiling point, 208°C),      propylene glycol monopropyl ether (boiling point, 150°C),<br>
cyclohexanone (boiling point, 145°C) and the like, for such purposes as improving water dispersibility of the resin component to increase paint stability and improving film thickness retention with time, finished appearance of coating film and electrocoatability on      galvanized alloy steel sheet.<br>
 <br>
On the other hand, use of these organic solvents is restricted in recent years for consideration of environments, by volatile organic compound (VOC) regulation or harmful atmospheric pollutants (HAPs) regulation.<br>
However, when volatile organic compound content of cationic electrodeposition paint composition is reduced, such drawbacks as deterioration in film thickness retention with time, finished appearance of coating film or electrocoatability of galvanized alloy steel sheet may occur.<br>
JP Sho 63 (1988)-92637A discloses electrodeposition paint containing cationic epoxy resin which is produced by adding organic acid and water to a resin obtained through reaction of a composition comprising diglycidyl ether of at least one kind of polyol and diglycidyl ether of at least one kind of dihydric phenol, with at least one kind of dihydric phenol, to convert the oxysilane groups in said resin to cationic groups.   Coating film formed by electrocoating the electrodeposition paint comprising the cationic epoxy resin, however, shows insufficient corrosion resistance.<br>
JP 2003-221547A discloses cationic electrodeposition paint containing as the base resin xylene formaldehyde resin-modified, amino group containing epoxy resin formed through reaction of an epoxy resin having epoxy equivalent of 180 - 2,500 with xylene formaldehyde resin and amino group-containing compound.    The cationic electrodeposition paint containing the xylene formaldehyde resin-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin as the base resin, however, may show defect in either of film thickness retention, finished appearance of coating film and electrocoatability on galvanized alloy steel sheet, when its organic solvent content is decreased for VOC reduction.<br>
JP Hei 8 (1996)-245750A discloses cationic electrodeposition paint containing an epoxy resin produced from diglycidyl ether of polyether polyol, which has an average epoxy equivalent of 350 -5,000, or an epoxy resin produced from glycidyl ether of partially capped polyether polyol, which has an average epoxy equivalent of 300 - 5,000.   A large amount of organic solvent must be added,<br>
 <br>
' however, for the cationic electrodeposition paint containing such an epoxy resin to exhibit favorable electrocoatability of galvanized alloy steel sheet, and the purpose of reducing volatile organic compound cannot be accomplished.<br>
JP 2001-3005A discloses a low VOC-containing paint excelling in film-forming property, electrocoatability of galvanized alloy steel sheet and corrosion resistance, which contains alkylene-type polyether polyol such as polymethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polybutylene glycol, or polyether polyol such as bisphenol alone or aromatic ring-containing polyether polyol obtained through reaction of bisphenol with glycol, as an additive. Also JP 2006-274234A discloses high stability electrodeposition paint which can form coating film free of pinholes and of excellent corrosion resistance when electrocoated on rust-preventive steel sheet, of which volatile organic solvent (VOC) content is reduced by blending specific polyether compound having a molecular weight not more than 1,000 as an additive.   When a large amount of the additive disclosed in JP 2001-3005A or JP 2006-274234A is added to electrodeposition paint, however, corrosion resistance of formed coating film may drop, or the      paint stability may drop when mechanical load is exerted on the electrocoating bath over a prolonged period.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a cationic electrodeposition paint composition which, even with reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) content, excels in film thickness retention, finished appearance of the coating film and electrocoatability of galvanized alloy steel sheet and can form coating film having high corrosion resistance.<br>
We have engaged in concentrative studies to now discover that the above object could be accomplished by a cationic electrodeposition paint composition containing amino group-containing modified epoxy resin as the resin component, said resin being obtained by reacting a specific modified epoxy resin with xylene formaldehyde resin having<br>
 <br>
phenolic hydroxyl groups and amino group-containing compound. Whereupon the present invention is completed.<br>

with epoxy resin (a2) having an epoxy equivalent of 170 - 500 and i     bisphenols (a3);<br>
(B)	xylene formaldehyde resin having phenolic hydroxyl<br>

 <br>
The amino group-containing modified epoxy resin CD which is<br>
contained in the cationic electrodeposition paint composition of the<br>
present invention as the resin component (base resin) exhibits<br>
excellent water-dispersibility, and the precipitated film shows good<br>
fusion at the time of electrocoating and good thermal flowability at<br>
the baking time.   Furthermore, the resin excels in the ability to<br>
inhibit permeation through the coating film of corrosive substances<br>
(e.g., oxygen ion, chlorine ion and the like).   Consequently, the<br>
cationic electrodeposition paint composition of the present invention<br>
has high paint stability such as, for example, ultrafiltration (UF)<br>
membrane applicability (U/F applicability) and filterability through<br>
precision filtering machine and, furthermore, use of the cationic<br>
electrodeposition paint composition of the present invention secures<br>
excellent film-forming property and film thickness retention even<br>
when volatile organic compound content of electrocoating bath<br>
prepared from the cationic electrodeposition paint composition is<br>
reduced, and can provide coated articles with coating films excelling<br>

Specific examples of which including bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,2-propane (bisphenol A), bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane (bisphenol F) and the like.<br>
Modified epoxy resin (A) can be normally produced by reacting above-described diepoxy compound (al), epoxy resin (a2) and bisphenols (a3), suitably in the presence of a catalyst for the reaction such as tertiary amine (e.g., dimethylbenzylamine, tributylamine and the like) or quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., tetraethylammonium<br>
 <br>
  bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide and the like), at<br>
temperatures of about 80 - about 200°C, preferably about 90 - about 180°C, for around 1-6 hours, preferably around 1-5 hours.<br>
More specifically, modified epoxy resin (A) can be obtained by either mixing all of the diepoxy compound (al), epoxy resin (a2) and bisphenols (a3) and allowing them to react; first reacting the diepoxy compound (al) with bisphenols (a3) and then reacting the resulting reaction product with the epoxy resin (a2); or first reacting the epoxy resin (a2) with bisphenols (a3) and reacting the resulting reaction product with the diepoxy compound (al).   The progress in such reactions can be traced by epoxy value.<br>
In the above reaction, a minor amount of secondary amine such as diethylamine, dibutylamine, diethanolamine, dipropanolamine, methylethanolamine and the like may be used as the reaction catalyst.   These secondary amines react with epoxy groups of the epoxy resin (a2) to form tertiary amines which act as the reaction catalyst.<br>
The use ratio of the diepoxy compound (al), epoxy resin (a2) and bisphenols (a3) in the above reaction, based on the total solid mass of these three components, can be as follows:   diepoxy compound (al), within a range of generally 1-35 mass%, in particular, 2-30 mass%, inter aha 2 — 25 mass%; epoxy resin (a2), within a range of generally 10 - 80 mass%, in particular, 15 - 75 mass%, inter alia. 20 - 70 mass%; and bisphenols (a3), within a range of generally 10-60 mass%, in particular, 15-50 mass%, inter aha, 18-45 mass%.<br>

 <br>
and the like; ether alcoholic compounds such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and the like; and mixtures of the foregoing.<br>
Thus obtained modified epoxy resin (A) has a number-average molecular weight within a range of generally 800 - 7,000, in particular, 1,000 - 6,000, inter alia. 1,000 - 5,000; and an epoxy equivalent within a range of generally 500 - 3,000, preferably 600 -2,500, inter alia, 600 - 2,000.<br>
Xylene formaldehyde resin (B) having phenolic hydroxyl groups<br>
Xylene formaldehyde resin (B) having phenolic hydroxyl groups, which is used as a starting material for production of the amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (I), contributes to internal plasticization (modification) of the modified epoxy resin (A), without reducing corrosion resistance of coating film.   It can be easily prepared, for example, by condensation reaction of xylene, formaldehyde and phenols in the presence of an acidic catalyst.<br>
As the formaldehyde, for example, compounds which generate formaldehyde, such as industrially readily available formaline, paraformaldehyde, trioxane and the like can be used.

These can be used either alone or in combination of two or more.    Of these, phenol and cresols are particularly preferred.<br>
As the acidic catalyst to be used in the condensation reaction of xylene, formaldehyde and phenols, for example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, paratoluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid and the like can be named, while generally sulfuric acid is particularly preferred.<br>
 <br>
Its adequate use rate is, in terms of concentration in aqueous solution<br>
because normally it is diluted with the water in aqueous<br>
formaldehyde solution, within the range of 10 - 50 mass%.<br>
The condensation reaction can he carried out by heating the<br>
system to temperatures at which xylene, phenols, water, formaline<br>
and the like which are present in the reaction system reflux,<br>
normally about 80 - about 100°C.  The reaction can be terminated<br>
normally in around 2-6 hours, whereupon producing liquid xylene<br>
formaldehyde resin.<br>

As the polyisocyanate compounds, those known per se can be used, for example, aromatic, aliphatic or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds such as tolylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, phenylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,2'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,4'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, crude MDI (polymethylenepolyphenyl isocyanate), bis(isocyanatomethyl)-cyclohexane, tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, methylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate and the like; cyclized polymers or biuret bodies of these polyisocyanate compounds; or combinations of the foregoing.<br>
From the viewpoint of corrosion resistance, aromatic polyisocyanate compounds such as tolylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, phenylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,4'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, crude MDI and the<br>
 <br>
like are particularly preferred.<br>
Isocyanate-blocking agent is to add to and block isocyanate groups of those polyisocyanate compounds.   Blocked polyisocyanate compounds produced of the addition are stable at ambient temperatures, but it is desirable that the blocking agent dissociates when heated to baking temperature of coating film (normally about 100 - about 200°C) to regenerate free isocyanate groups.<br>
As the blocking agent used in blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, for example, oxiime compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime, cyclohexanone oxime and the like; phenolic compounds such as phenol, para-t-butylphenol, cresol and the like; aliphatic alcohols such as n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol and the like; aromatic alkyl alcohols such as pheinylcarbinol, methylphenylcarbinol and the like; ether alcoholic compounds such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and the like; and lactam compounds such as є-caprolactam, γ-butyrolactam and the like can be named.<br>
The blend ratio of the amino, group-containing modified epoxy resin and blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent in the resin component is, based on the total solid mass of the two: the amino group-containing modified epoxy resin, generally 50 - 85 mass%, preferably 55 - 80 mass%, inter alia. 55 - 78 mass%; and the blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, generally 15 - 50 mass%, preferably 20 - 45 mass°/o, inter alia, 22 - 45 mass%.<br>
Cationic electrodeposition paint composition:<br>
The cationic electrodeposition paint composition of the present invention can be prepared by formulating into paint the amino group -containing modified epoxy resin (I) ,and, where necessary, crosslinking agent, in particular, blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent following conventional practice; more specifically, by thoroughly mixing the amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (I) and optionally a crosslinking agent, with various paint additives such as surfactant, surface regulating agent and the like, and organic<br>
solvent, thereafter neutralizing the mixture with an acid, e.g., a<br>
i<br>
 <br>
water-soluble organic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and the like or mixtures thereof to make it water-soluble or water-dispersible, adding to the resulting emulsion pigment-dispersed paste, and further adding water to adjust the concentration.<br>
Pigment-dispersed paste is a paste in which coloring pigment, rust-preventive pigment, extender and the like are finely dispersed in advance.    It can be prepared by, for example, subjecting a pigment-dispersant, neutralizer and pigment to a dispersing treatment in a dispersing mixer such as ball mill, sarid mill, pebble mill or the like.<br>
As the pigment dispersant, those known per se can be used, examples of which including base resin containing hydroxyl groups and cationic groups; surfactant; and pigment-dispersing resins such as tertiary amine type epoxy resin, quaternary ammonium salt type<br>
!	j<br>
epoxy resin, tertiary sulfonium salt type epoxy resin and the like. Such pigment dispersant can be used within a range of normally 1 -<br>
150 mass parts, in particular, 10 - 100 mass parts, per 100 mass<br>
i	j<br>
parts of the pigment used-Examples of pigment include coloring pigments such as titanium dioxide, Carbon Black, red iron oxide and the like,'<br>
extenders such as clay, mica, baryta, calcium carbonate, silica and<br>
i	i<br>
the like; and rust-preventiye pigments such as aluminum<br>
phosphomolybdate, aluminum tripolyphosphate, zinc oxide (zinc<br>
flower) and the like.<br>
The cationic electrodeposition paint compositions of the present invention can contain bismuth compound, where necessary, for inhibiting corrosion or rust.   Examples of the bismuth compound including bismuth oxide, bismuth hydroxide, basic bismuth carbonate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth silicate and organic acid salts of bismuth.<br>
In the cationic electrodeposition paint compositions of the invention, organic tin compound such as dibutyltin dibenzoate, dioctyltin oxide, dibutyltinoxide and the like may also be blended for improving curability of coating film.   Whereas, it is possible to improve curability of the coating film without blending such organic tin compounds, by increasing the adding amount of, and/or finely dividing, aforesaid rust-preventive pigment such as zinc oxide (zinc<br>
 <br>
flower) and/or bismuth compound, <br>
The combined amount to be added of above described pigment,<br>
i' bismuth compound and organotin compound preferably is within a<br>
range of normally 1-100 mass parts, in particular, 10-50 mass<br>
parts, per 100 mass parts of the total solid content of the resin<br>
component, i.e., the amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (I),<br>
crosslinking agent and pigment-dispersing resin.<br>

In particular, coating objects comprising galvanized alloy steel sheet are suitable.<br>
Cationic electrodeposition paint compositions of the present invention can be applied onto surfaces of such coating objects as<br>
 <br>

about 15 - about 35°C and applying electric current under exertion of<br>
electric pressure of 100 - 400 V, with the coating object serving as the<br>
cathode.   After the electrocoating, normally the coated object is<br>
thoroughly washed with filtrate of ultrafiltration (UF filtrate),<br>
permeate of reverse osmosis (RO water), industrial water, pure water<br>
or the like, to be removed of excessively deposited cationic<br>
electrodeposition paint.	<br>
While the thickness of the electrocoated film is not particularly limited, it may generally range 5-40 µm, preferably 12 - 30 urn, based on the cured coating film.   Baking of the coated film can be carried out by heating the electrocoated film with, for example, drying facilities such as electric hot air dryer, gas hot air dryer or the like, normally at 110 - 200°C, preferably 140 - 180°C, in terms of the surface temperature of the coated object, normally for 10 - 180 minutes, preferably 20 - 50 minutes.  By the baking, the coating film can be cured.<br>
Thus, coated articles having electrocoated film exhibiting excellent corrosion resistance can be obtained.<br>
