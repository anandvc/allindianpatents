The present invention relates to the field of cancer treatment and provides an antitumor composition comprising a substituted acryloyl distamycin derivative, more particularly an a-bromo- or a-chloro-acryloyl distamycin derivative, and an alkylating agent, having a synergistic antineoplastic effect.<br>
Distamycin A and analogues thereof, hereinafter referred to as distamycin and distamycin-like derivatives, are known in the art as cytotoxic agents useful in antitumor therapy.<br>
Distamycin A is an antibiotic substance with antiviral and antiprotozoal activity, having a polypyrrole framework [Nature 203:1064 (1964); J. Med. Chem, 32: 774-778 (1989)]. The international patent applications WO 90/11277, WO 98/04524, WO 98/21202, WO 99/50265, WO 99/50266 and WO 01/40181 (claiming priority fi-om British patent application No. 9928703.9), all in the name of the applicant itself and herewith incorporated by reference, disclose acryloyl distamycin derivatives wherein the amidino moiety of distamycin is optionally replaced by nitrogen-containing ending groups such as, for instance, cyanamidino, N-methylamidino, guanidino, carbamoyl, amidoxime, cyano and the like, and/or wherein the polypyrrole firamework of distamycin, or part of it, is replaced by varying carbocyclic or heterocyclic moieties.<br><br><br>
R2  is  a  distatnycm or distamycin-like framework;  or  a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and an alkylating agent.<br>
The present invention includes, within its scope, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising any of the possible isomers covered by the compounds of formula (I), both considered separately or in admixture, as well as the metabolites and the pharmaceutically acceptable bio-precursors (otherwise known as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
In the present description, unless otherwise specified, with the term distamycin or distamycin-like framework R2 we intend any moiety structurally closely related to distamycin itself for instance by optionally replacing the ending amidino moiety of distamycin and/or its polypyrrole framework, or part of it.<br>
Alkylating agents are widely known in the art as described in various scientific<br>
publications.<br>

The present invention further provides a product comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of fonnula (I), as defined above, and an alkylating agent, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in antitumor therapy.<br>
A fiarther aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treatmg a mammal, including humans, suffering from a neoplastic disease state, which method comprises administering to said mammal the above acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I) and an alkylating agent, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect<br>
The present invention also provides a method for lowering the side effects caused by antineoplastic therapy with an antineoplastic agent in a mammal in need thereof, including humans, the method comprising administering to said mammal a combined preparation comprising an alkylating agent and an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), as defined above, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect.<br>
By the term "synergistic antineoplastic effect", as used herein, it is meant the inhibition of the growth tumor, preferably the complete regression of the tumor, by administering an effective amount of the combination comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I) and an alkylating agent to mammals, including humans.<br><br>
By the term "administered " or "administering", as used herein, it is meant parenteral and/or oral administration; the term "parenteral" means intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administration.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the acryloyl distamycin derivative may be administered simultaneously with the alkylating agent or, alternatively, both compounds maybe administered sequentially in either order.<br>
In this respect, it will be appreciated that the actual preferred method and order of administration will vary according to, inter alia, the particular formulation of the acryloyl distamycin of formula (I) being used, the particular formulation of the alkylating agent being used, the particular tumor model being treated as well as the particular host being treated.<br>
To administer the acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (T), according to the method of the invention, the course of therapy generally employed comprises doses varying from about 0.05 to about 100 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
For the administration of the alkylating agent, according to the method of the<br>
invention, the course of therapy generally employed comprises:<br>
for the administration of mustard compounds doses varying from about 1 mg/m2 to<br>
about 5000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about<br>
1000 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
for the administration of nitrosourea derivatives doses varying from about 1 mg/m to<br>
about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about<br>
1000 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
for the administration of tetrazine and aziridine compounds doses varying from about<br>
1 mg/m2 to about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about<br>
10 to about 1000 mg/m of body surface area.<br>
for the administration of platinum derivatives doses varying from about 1 mg/m to<br>
about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about<br>
500 mg/m of body surface area.<br><br>
The antineoplastic therapy of the present invention is particularly suitable for treating breast, ovary, lung, colon, kidney, stomach, pancreas, liver, melanoma, leukemia and brain tumors in mammals, including humans.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), as defined above, and an alkylatiug agent, in the preparation of a medicament for use in the prevention or treatment of metastasis or in the treatment of tumors by inhibition of angiogenesis.<br>
As stated above, the effect of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I) and aa alkylating agent, for instance cisplatin and carboplatin, is significantly increased without a parallel increase of toxicity. In other words, the combined therapy of the present invention enhances the antitumoral effects of the acryloyl distamycin derivative and of the alkylating agent and, hence, provides the most effective and least toxic treatment for tumors.<br>
The synergistic or super additive effect of the combined preparations of the invention is shown, for instance, by the following in vivo tests which are intended to illustrate the present invention without posing any limitation to it.<br>
Table 1 shows the antileukemic activity on disseminated L1210 murine leukemia<br>
obtained by combining the representative compound of formula (I) of the invention N-<br>
(5-{[(5-{[(5-{[(2-{[amino(imno)methyl]amino}ethyI)amino]carbonyI}-l-methyI-lH-<br>
pyrrol-3-yl)amino]carbonyl}-l-methyl4H-pyrrol-3-yl)amino]carbonyl}-l-methyl-lH--<br>
pyrrol-3-yl)-4-[(2-bromoacryloyl)amino]-l-methyl--lH-pyrrole-2--carboxariiide<br>
hydrochloride - internal code PNU 166196, with cisplatin.<br>
At the dose of 5.9 mg/kg of cisplatin alone (day +3) and at the dose of 0.26 mg/kg of<br>
PNU 166196 alone (days +1,2) were associated, without toxicity, with JLS% values of<br>
67 and 33, respectively.<br><br>
Combining cisplatin and PNU 166196 at the same doses with the same schedule, an increase of activity with E.S% values of 125 were observed, thus indicating a synergistic antitumor effect.<br>
Table 2 shows the antileukemic activity on disseminated LI 210 murine leukemia<br>
obtained by combining the above PNU 166196 derivative with carboplatin.<br>
At the dose of 135 mg/kg of carboplatin alone (day +3) and at the dose of 0.26 mg/kg<br>
of PNU 166196 alone (days +1,2) were associated, without toxicity, with ILS% values<br>
of 50 and 33, respectively.<br>
By combining carboplatin and PNU 166196 at the same doses and with the same<br>
schedule, an increase of activity with ILS% values of 92 were observed, again<br>
indicating a more than additive effect.<br>
Table 3 shows the antitumor effect on subcutaneous implanted HCT-116 human colon<br>
carcinoma obtained by combining PNU 166196 with cisplatin.<br>
At the dose of 2 mg/kg of cisplatin alone (q7dx3) and at the dose of 0.4 mg/kg of PNU<br>
166196 alone (q7dx3) were associated, without toxicity, T/C% values of 92 and 61,<br>
respectively.<br>
By combining cisplatin and PNU 166196, iostead, a significant increase in tumor<br>
growth delay was  observed,  hence  indicating  a therapeutic  advantage  of the<br>
combination (synergism) in comparison to the administration of the drugs alone.<br>
For these experiments PNU 166196 was solubilized in water for injection, while standard pharmaceutical preparations were used for cisplatin and carboplatin.<br><br><br>
