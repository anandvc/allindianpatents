Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a thiazolidinedione derivative, represented in formula (1) below, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof. Further, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound represented in formula (1) below.<br>
Formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>
X represents a carbon or nitrogen atom; y represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a halogen, or an aryl group; Z represents an oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atom; and R1 and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom, or R1 and R2 together form a bond.<br>
Background Art<br>
Thiazolidinedione based compounds are oral diabetes therapeutic agents for treating insulin resistance, using a new mechanism different from that of conventional diabetes therapeutic agents. They lower blood sugar level by increasing physiological effects of insulin on target ceils (muscle, adipocytes, liver, etc.). Now, the thiazolidinedione based compounds are highlighted as new diabetes therapeutic agents. Further, it has been reported in several documents that<br>
as insulin, free fatty acid, and triglycende, etc. accumulate to high levels in the body, the thiazolidinedione based compounds strongly suppress further synthesis (Miuoni Oguchi, et al., J.Med. Ghent., 2000, 43, 3052-3066; B.B. Lohray, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 2569-2581; Braj. B. Lohray, V. Bhushan, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1997, 7(7), 785-788; Reiving. Liu, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2001, 11, 2385-2388; T.M. Willson et al., .J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43(4), 527-550; Jeffery, E. Cobb, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 665-668; J. Med. Chem., 1998, 41, 5055-5069; John L. Collins, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1998, 41, 5037-5054; Hisashi Shinkai etal.,.7. Med. Chem., 1998, 41, 1927-1933).<br>
Rosiglitazone is commercially available. It is the strongest thiazolidinedione based compound discovered until now. It has been disclosed in European Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 0,842,925 and a journal (J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37, 3977-3985), which arc incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Rosiglitazone, having a structure similar to that of the present invention, is represented in formula (2) below.<br>
Formula (2)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
wherein, A is formula (a) or (b) below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, R4 and R5 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, or when R4 and R1 are each attached to adjacent carbons, R4 and R together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring, in which each carbon atom represented by R4 and R5 together may be substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
Rosiglitazone  exhibits a moderate blood sugar-lowering effect, but  has little<br>
activity versus hyperlipidemia, which is common in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, because its half life is short in terms of  pharmacodynamics, it must be inconveniently administered twice a day. In rare cases, it has been clinically reported that liver toxicity involved in use of rosiglitazone drugs causes death. Therefore, there is a disadvantage in that the patients with diabetes must have their liver function tested periodically.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a new thiazolidinedione based compound having activities such as strong blood sugar lowering action and strong blood lipid lowering action, compared with rosiglitazone, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the thiazolidinedione based compound.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a new thiazolidinedione based compound, in which its half-life is remarkably prolonged, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the thiazolidinedione based<br>
compound.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a new thiazolidinedione based compound, in which liver toxicity, a common side effect t encountered with this type of compound drug, is not found, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the thiazolidinedione based compound.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out (he Invention<br>
To overcome disadvantages of rosiglitazone described above, the inventors have researched documents concerning thiazolidinedione based compounds for several years. At the same time, they have studied the relationship of the thiazolidinedione based drug and its receptor using computer-aided molecular<br>
design.<br>
According to the X-ray crystal structure of a PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor), a molecule that influences insulin resistance, it has<br>
been found that part of the lipophilic tail thereof consists of hydrophobia residues such as isoleucine, valine leucine. etc. Also, the size of active site thereof is very large, and the length and volume of the site are sufficient for about two hexagonal aromatic rings to be introduced into the site. Based on these facts, the inventors made an every efforts to develop new drugs with excellent functional groups, binding strongly with the PPARγ, a molecule that influences insulin resistance. As a result, they induced a substituted or unsubstituted aryl structure, i.e. a substituted or unsubstituted pyridine or pyrimidine, in which a nitrogen, an oxygen or a sulfur atom is incorporated at the para position of the first nitrogen of the pyridine or pyrimidine, i.e., at the 4 position. By preparing a thiazolidinedione based compound containing the aryl structure in the laboratory and then assaying its pharmacological toxicity, the present inventors have found it to be a new and excellent thiazolidinedione derivative for treatment of diabetes.<br>
In terms of the structure of rosiglitazone of formula (2) above compared with the present invention of the formula (1), A in the formula (2) is pyrimidine or pyridine, which corresponds to the pyrimidine (X=N) or pyridine (X=C) of the formula (1). As for the pyrimidine, an amine is bound at C-2 position in rosiglitazone, while an amine is bound at C-6 position in the present invention. Furthermore, the present invention has a substituted or unsubstituted aryl (phenyl) group, in which an oxygen, a nitrogen or a sulfur atom may exist at C-4 position of the pyrimidine or pyridine. Specifically, the substituent is incorporated at the para position of the pyrimidine or pyridine, which is the most stable position in terms of chemical structure, thereby a stable molecular structure being obtained. In addition to the above, according to the computer-aided molecular design(SAR), the active site of the PPARy which is a molecule that influences insulin resistance, is three-dimensionally suitable for accepting the structure of the present invention compound, thereby the high pharmaceutical effect of the present invention compound being obtained. Accordingly, the present invention has a three dimensional structure distinguishable from a conventional rosiglitazone.<br>
The present invention exhibits a strong blood sugar lowering activity and a strong blood lipid lowering activity, thereby capable of being used in the treatment or prevention of hyperglycemia. In particular, it has been found that the present invention is useful for the treatment of type II diabetes.<br>
Further, it has been found that the present invention can be used in the treatment and/or prevention of other diseases such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and bulimia.<br>

Undifferentiated adipocyic 3T3-L1 cells were inoculated in a 24-well plate<br>
and cultivated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To induce differentiation of the undifferentiated adipocytes, the cells were then incubated in a differentiation medium. After adding a certain concentration of each of the test compounds to the medium, the cells were again incubated for 24 hours. After removing the medium, the cells were washed with phosphate buffer, and 0.5 nM of insulin in phosphate buffer was added to the washed cells, followed by incubation for 40 minutes. Then, 0.5 uL of 2-dcoxy-D-[2,6-3H] glucose per well was again added to the cells, which were let stand for 4 minutes. Then, the cells were washed with phosphate buffer, and cell lysis buffer was added, so as to dissolve the cell membranes. The cell sample was placed into a liquid scintillation cocktail solution. The radioactivity of the sample was counted by a liquid scintillation counter. Based on the obtained results, the concentrations of the test compounds which resulted in 50% of maximum enhancement of insulin activation, were determined (EC50, nM). The results arc presented in Table 1.<br>
