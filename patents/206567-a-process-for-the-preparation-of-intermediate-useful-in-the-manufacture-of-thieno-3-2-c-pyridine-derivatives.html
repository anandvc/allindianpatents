THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THIENO[3,2-C] PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES"<br>
Cadila Healthcare: Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act,  1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Road, Ahmedabad 308 015, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and manner in waich it is to be performed:<br>
22-11-2003<br><br>
A PROCESS TO PREPARE CLOPIDOGREL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of thieno[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives of general formula (I), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms and their salts, wherein X, 5      the substituent on benzene ring represents either a hydrogen or halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br><br><br><br>
(I)(±)or(+)or(-)<br>
Preferably, X represents 2-chloro.<br>
10	The present invention also describes a process for preparing the compounds of general formula<br>
(II), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms and their salts, where X, the substituent on benzene ring represents either a hydrogen or halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br><br>
Preferably X represents 2-chloro. These compounds are useful intermediates to prepare compounds of general formula (I)<br>
The compounds represented by formulae (I) and (II) have one asymmetric carbon and hence, to obtain optically active compounds of formula (I) or of formula (II), option available is either to 20      resolve the racemic intermediate/final product or use an optically active intermediate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thieno[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives disclosed in FR 2,215,948: FR 2,530,247 and FR 2,612,929, are pharmacologically active and have significant anti-aggregating and anti-thrombotic properties. One such example is 'Clopidogrel', (.S)-(+)-(2-chlorophen\l)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl) 25 acetic acid methyl ester and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Later, it was found that the biological activity resides only with (S)-(+)-stereoisomer (US 4.847,265). As 'Clopidogrel base' is an oily liquid, in order to prepare a convenient formulation, the base is converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitable salts of 'Clopidogrel base' can be formed with taurocholate, hydrobromide and sulfuric acid. 30      DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The reported methods to synthesize the compounds of general formula (I) (US 4529596, GB 0420706 and GB 0466569), use a-halophenylacetic acid derivatives, which are larimatory and irritant in nature. The processes to synthesize such compounds involve multiple steps, and have other<br><br><br>
drawbacks due to the chemicals/reagents used, which usually are difficult to handle, scale-up and unfavorable from human health as well as environmental point of view. Moreover, overall yields of these processes range from poor to average. Various other synthetic approaches found in literature, involve expensive or hazardous chemicals, which do not significantly improve the yield of the desired 5      product.<br>
Recently, radiolabeled (bezene-U-13C) racemic(±)-Clopidogrel has been prepared as a standard<br>
for metabolic studies in an overall yield of 7 % using orthometalation/chlorination of benzoic acid<br>
derivative (Chem. Abst., 133:281711, 2000). Various other strategies are disclosed in: WO 98/51681,<br>
WO 98/51682, WO 98/51689, WO 99/18110, US 4,876,362, US 5,036,156, US 5,132,435, US<br>
10      5,139,170, US 5,204,469 and US 6,080,875.<br>
Recently, a new polymorph of Clopidogrcl bisulfatc (named as form II) has been disclosed in<br>
patent application (WO 99/65915), which has a melting point of 176 ± 3 °C. It also mentions that the<br>
compound disclosed in the earlier US patent (US 4,847,265), had a different melting point of about<br>
184 ± 3 °C (now referred as, form I). It has been shown that both the polymorphs have distinct and<br>
15     characteristic XRD and IR spectrum.<br>
Consequently, the present invention aims to provide an inexpensive and commercially viable process to prepare compounds of formula (I) in good yields. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

Accordingly, the present invention provides a process to prepare compounds of formula (I), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms and their salts, where X represents either hydrogen or a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. More particularly, the present invention provides a process to prepare Clopidogrcl bisulfatc.<br>
The process to prepare compounds of formula (I) or its salts, uses compounds of formula (II)<br><br><br>
20<br>
or its salts, in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms, as outlined in Scheme I.<br><br><br>
Each intermediate in Scheme I has one chiral center. Hence, to prepare an optically active product, such as compound represented by formula (I), particularly Clopidogrel and its salt, it is possible to use an optically active intermediate from the first step onwards.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and 5      their salts as shown in scheme 1, which comprises:<br>
1.	preparing compound of formula (IV), (±)-(2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyrid -5-yl)acetonitrile as described in Scheme 2, i.e. via Strecker reaction;<br>
2.	resolving, if desired, the racemic mixture of compound of formula (IV) into its optically active (+) and (-) stereoisomers; and recycling the unwanted stereoisomer into the process by racemization;<br>
10 3. transforming the compound of formula (IV) in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) form or its salt, into the compound of formula (TI), (±)-(2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-cJpyrid-5-yl)acetamide or optically active corresponding (+) or (-) form, based upon starting material used;<br>
4.	resolving, if desired, the racemic compound of formula (II) - into its optically active (+) and (-)<br>
15           stereoisomers; and recycling the unwanted stereoisomer into the process by racemization;<br>

or its salt, into either optically active or racemic compound of formula (I), (±)-(2-chloro phenyl)-<br>
(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyrid-5-yl)acetate methyl ester, in racemic or optically active (+)<br>
and (-) form and its salt, based upon starting material used;<br>
20 6. further resolving and/or transforming the racemic/optically active compound of formula (I) into their pharmaccutically acceptable salts and/or, liberating the racemic or optically active compound of formula (I) from its salts.<br>
Alternatively, cither of the compounds of formulae (IV) or (II), cither racemic or optically active (+) or (-) form can be transformed into corresponding compounds of formula (III); which can then be 15      converted into corresponding compound of formula (I).<br>
The compound of formula (IV) in racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms can be directly converted into corresponding compound of formula (I).<br>
Optionally, suitable acid addition salts of the intermediates of formula II, III and IV may be used in the above mentioned processes. Suitable acids used may be selected from acetic, benzoic, fumaric. 30      maleic, citric, tartaric, gentisic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, bcnzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, camphor sulfonic, hydrochloric, sulfuric, hydrobromic acids and the like.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel intermediate of formula (IV) and its salts.<br><br><br>
Yet another aspect of the process of invention includes preparation of intermediate described by general formula (IV) and as depicted in the Scheme 2, by Strecker reaction, using a secondary- amine (Organic Synthesis Collective Volume III. page no. 275)<br><br>
SCHEME2<br>
The process to prepare compounds of formula (IV) includes, reacting amine of formula (V) or its salt, with a cyanide derivative of the general formula (VII), wherein M represents either alkali metals such as Na, K, Lt, or H, trimethylsilyl (TMS) and the like; with 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI). The synthesis of amine or its salt having formula (V) is described in FR 2608607.<br>
The above reaction can be carried out in various ways. A few such methods are outlined in Scheme 2 shown above. Initially, amine of formula (V), or its salt, is reacted with cyanide (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, followed by addition of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (VI). Alternatively, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (VI) is treated with cyanide of formula (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, and the intermediate cyanohydrin is further reacted with amine of formula (V) or its salt. In en alternative method, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI) is added to hydrogen sulfite derivative of formula (VIII) wherein M' represents Na, K, Li and the like; followed by reaction with cyanide of formula (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, and finally amine of formula (V) or its salt in an in situ reaction. Irrespective of the variations in the reaction methodology, the yield of resultant intermediate (IV) obtained is comparable.<br>
The preferred method involves, addition of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI) to hydrogen sulfite derivative of formula (VIII). The salt formed is treated with cyanide of formula (VII), and finally with an amine of formula (V) or its salt in presence of suitable reagent and solvents.<br>
Suitable reagents includes acid catalysts, such as glacial acetic acid (Synthesis, 1989, 616-618), hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methancsulfonic acid, trifluoroacctic acid, polyphosphoric acid and the like.<br>

The preferred solvent is a mixture of<br><br>
solvents and water in varying ratio. The more preferred reaction medium includes a mixture<br>
containing water and (C1-C4)alcohol in a ratio varying between 1:1 and 1:10.<br>
When the reaction is carried out in aprotic or hydrophobic solvent, a phase transfer catalyst and a<br>
biphasic solvent system is necessary. Suitable phase transfer catalyst used in such a case may be 5      tetrabutyl ammonium halide, benzyltrimethylammonium halide, and the like.<br>
During the reaction, certain additives may be added. Such suitable additives may be cyclo[(S)-<br>
histidine-(S)-phenyl alanine] and the like<br>
The reaction temperature may range from -30 °C to reflux temperature of the solvent(s) used. The<br>
preferred temperature ranges from 0 °C to 100 °C, and more preferably, from 40 °C to 80 °C. 10      However, when HCN (g) (Scheme 2, Intermediate VII, M = H) is used the required temperature is in<br>
the range of about -30 °C to -10 °C.<br>
This reaction may be carried out in the absence or presence of an inert atmosphere such as N;, He<br>
or Ar. The duration of the reaction may vary from 1 hrs to 3 days, more specifically 2 hrs to 2 days. It is preferable to react a compound of formula (V), hydrogen sulfite derivative (VIH), and 15     cyanide derivative (VII) with respect to 2-chloro benzaldehyde (VI) in the ratio preferably between 1<br>
to 1.2 equivalents. The racemic cyano compound (IV) thus obtained, can be resolved into optically<br>
active (+) and (-) forms.<br>
The cyano compound (IV) thus obtained can be converted into corresponding acid of formula<br>
(III), amide of formula (II) or acid of formula (I) as shown in Scheme 1 (R. C. Larrock, in 20      "Comprehensive Organic Transformations", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1999, 2nd Ed., 815 - 818 and<br>
references therein).<br>
Yet, another aspect of the present invention is to convert these intermediates II and HI, into<br>
compounds of formula I, as shown in scheme 1. Each of (±), (+) or (-) the isomer of intermediate of<br>
formulae II and III, can be converted into the corresponding isomer of compounds of formula I.<br>
25	The preferred route to obtain the compound of formula (I), involves conversion of either (±), (+)<br>
or (-) isomer cyano compound (IV) and its salts, into amide compound of formula (II), in the presence<br>
of suitable acidsftase reagents in suitable solvents Later resolving the amide into optically active (+)<br>
or (-) form or its salt and the optically active amide is being converted into optically active ester of<br>
formula (I) in presence of suitable catalyst and reagent.<br>

used in the above process can be in the range from 0.01 to 1.2 moles equivalents. The reaction may be<br>
carried out in the absence or presence of an inert atmosphere such as N2, He or Ar. The reactions<br>
under the basic conditions are preferably under inert atmosphere. The duration of reaction may range<br>
from 1/2 hr to 5 days, preferably from 2 hrs to 2 days.<br>
10	The amide of formula (II), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) form, or their salt, can be<br>
converted to corresponding methyl ester of formula (I), in presence of at least one equivalent of<br>

The temperature ranges from 20 °C to 250 °C, preferably from 50 °C to 150 °C.<br>
The reagents used in above process may range from 0.01 moles to equimolar ratios. The reaction may be carried out in the absence or presence of an inert atmosphere such as N^, He or Ar. The duration of reaction may range from 3 hours to 5 days, preferably from 3 hr to 2 days.<br>
This manufacturing process to prepare the compounds of general formula (F) as shown in scheme 10      1, has following advantages:<br>
1)	It requires less number of steps to prepare the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
2)	Simple readily available reagents / chemicals arc used.<br>
3)	Milder reaction conditions are employed in various steps.<br>
4)	It is possible to get chiral/optically active intermediates at every stage (I, II, III, IV, or V)<br>
15	5)  It is possible to racemize the unwanted isomers thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing<br>
environmental load. 6)  The above factors contribute to improve cost effectiveness of the process described herein. The compounds of the formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) can be resolved by various methods to get optically active compounds of the formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV), which can give Clopidogrcl of<br>
20 desired stereochemistry (R. A. Sheldon, in "Chirotechnology", Marcel Dekker, Inc. NY, Basel, 1993, 173-204 and references therein; A. N. Collins, G. N. Sheldrack and J Crosby, in "Chirality in Industry II", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1997, 81-98 and references therein; E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, in "Stereochemistry of Organic Compound", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1999, 297-464 and references therein).<br>
25	The process of resolution comprises of dissolving the racemic mixture (of formulae I, II, HI or W)<br>
in suitable solvent and addition of a suitable chirai reagent. Optionally the medium may contain water about 
30 separation may result simply by stirring at a suitable temperature in a solvent(s) until one of the salts preferentially precipitate out. Purification of diastereomeric salt is possible by refluxing in a suitable solvent. The free base is liberated from its salt using a suitable base reagent. The diastereomeric salt is dissolved or suspended in a mixture of water and organic solvent and is neutralized with a base under stirring. The free base is obtained after separation of aqueous layer and evaporation of the organic<br>
35      solvent.<br>
The solvents used during the resolution can include solvents or mixtures diereof such as (C1-C4) alcohol, (C1-C4 ketone, dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone.<br><br>
acctonitrile, propionitrile, THF, dioxane and the like; the solvent used optionally may contain water up to 5 %, but presence of water or its amount is not critical. Suitable temperature range for the resolution includes temperature from 0 °C to reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably 0 °C to 80 °C. The acid chiral reagents, which can be used to form a diastereomeric salt, include tartaric acid, 5      niandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, amino acids and the like.<br>
By repeated crystallization from a suitable solvent, the precipitated salt is enriched in the salt of dextrorotatory isomer of the desired diastereomer to yield a product of constant optical rotation.<br>
Suitable base reagent for the hydrolysis of diastereomeric salt includes sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous 10     media at temperatures varying between 5 °C to 25 °C.<br>
Finally, the desired salt of compound of formula (II), (III), or (IV); or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt of compound of formula (I) can be formed from the corresponding stereoisomer and a suitable<br>
acid. The optically pure (S)-(+) compound of formula (I), is converted into its bisulfate salt using<br>
sulfuric acid 70 % to 98 %, in an appropriate solvent at suitable temperature to afford (+)- Clopidogrel<br>
15     bisufate, polymorph I as desired.<br>
Alternatively,   the  diastereomers  formed  may  be  separated  by  conventional   methods   of<br>
purification such as fractional crystallization, column chromatography and the like followed by<br>
cleavage of salt to give product of desired stereochemistry. It is preferable to use, such a chiral agent,<br>
which can selectively form diastereoisomer with either R or S stereoisomer of intermediate I, II, III or<br>
20      IV. The chiral reagent used may be in 0.5 to 1.1 molar ratio.<br>
Determination of the enantiomeric purity of the (+)-dextrorotatory and (-)-laevorotatory enantiomers<br>
may be carried through proton NMR spectroscopy w ith the addition of a chiral rare earth reagents<br>
(shift reagents) or by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase as well as through measurement of optical<br>
rotation.<br>
25	The absolute stereochemistry of the diastereomeric salt of II, HI or IV compounds may be<br>
determined using conventional methods, such as X-ray crystallography. The absolute stereochemistry of chiral compounds can also be determined by comparing it with the reference standards know n in literature.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable mineral and organic acid salts of optically active enantiomers of 30      Clopidogrel are prepared using various acidic salts, which forms a part of this invention but are not limited to hydrogen sulfates, hydrohalides, taurocholates and the like.<br>
More specifically the present process of invention results in Clopidogrel bisulfate of melting point<br>
184 ±3 °C, which is characteristic of Clopidogrel bisulfate form I. Alternatively, Clopidogrel bisulfate<br>
form II can also be prepared by known method (WO 99/65915, FR 98 07464).<br>
35	The process of this invention also includes the process to recycle the unwanted stereoisomer<br>
through racemization. The conditions for racemization of all the intermediates of general formula II, III or IV as well as final product I, involves the similar solvent and catalyst in equimolar quantities.<br><br>
Suitable catalyst i.c generally a base such as LDA(Lithium diisoprop} lamide), KOH, NaOH, KT-/-BuO", NaOMe, NaH, KH and the like. Suitable solvent used during the resolution can include solvents or mixtures thereof such as (C1-C4) alcohol. (C1-C4)ketone, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, THF, dioxane and the like; the solvent used optionally may contain water up to 5 %. Suitable<br>
5      temperature range for the resolution includes temperature from 0 °C to reflux temperature of die solvent used, preferably 0 ° to 80 °C.<br>
