CROSS-REFERENCE<br>
[0001]   This  application  claims  the  benefit  of  U.S.  Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/981,267, filed on October 19, 2007.  The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]   The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engines<br>
and more particularly to intake air temperature sensor diagnostics.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an engine<br>
system 100 is presented. Air is drawn into an engine 102 through an intake line<br>
104 and an intake manifold 106. A throttle valve 108 is actuated by an electronic<br>
throttle control (ETC) motor 109 to vary the volume of air drawn into the engine<br>
102.<br><br><br>
[0005] The air mixes with fuel from one or more fuel injectors 110 to<br>
fomn an air-fuel mixture. The air-fuel mixture is combusted within one or more<br>
cylinders 112 of the engine 102. Although the fuel injector 110 is shown as<br>
injecting fuel into the cylinders 112, fuel may be injected at any suitable location,<br>
such as into the intake line 104 or the intake manifold 106. Resulting exhaust<br>
gas Is expelled from the cylinders 112 to an exhaust system 114. The<br>
combustion of the air-fuel mixture generates torque.<br>
[0006] An intake air temperature (lAT) sensor 116 measures intake air<br>
temperature at any suitable point in the air intake system, such as in the intake<br>
line 104 or the intake manifold 106. An engine control module (ECM) 120<br>
receives an lAT signal from the lAT sensor 116 and may receive signals from<br>
other sensors 122. The other sensors 122 may include, for example, a mass air<br>
flow (MAF) sensor, a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, and/or one or<br>
more throttle position sensors (TPS). The ECM 120 controls the air-fuel mixture<br>
based upon the received signals via, for example, the throttle valve 108 and/or<br>
the fuel injectors 110.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] An intake air temperature (lAT) sensor diagnostic module<br>
comprises a measured noise module, an expected noise module, an excess<br>
noise module, and an IAT fault detection module. The measured noise module<br>
measures noise in an IAT signal from an IAT sensor in a vehicle. The expected<br>
noise module detemrines expected noise based upon the IAT signal. The<br>
excess noise module determines an excess noise value based upon the<br><br>
measured noise and the expected noise.  The lAT fault detection module<br>
diagnoses faults in the lAT sensor based upon a comparison of the excess noise<br>
value and a first predetemined value.<br>
[0008] In other features, the expected noise module comprises a<br>
lookup table of expected noise indexed by lAT signal, and the expected noise<br>
module determines the expected noise based upon the IAT signal and the lookup<br>
table. In still other features, the expected noise module comprises a filter module<br>
that filters the lAT signal, and the expected noise module determines the<br>
expected noise based upon the filtered lAT signal. The filter module comprises a<br>
first order lag filter.<br>
[0009] In further features, the lAT sensor diagnostic module further<br>
comprises a comparison module. The comparison module compares the excess<br>
noise value with the first predetermined value, generates one of a first signal and<br>
a second signal based upon the comparison, and generates the first signal when<br>
the excess noise value is greater than the first predetermined value.<br>
[0010] In still further features, the lAT sensor diagnostic module further<br>
comprises a counter module having a first counter that is incremented when the<br>
first signal is generated. The lAT fault detection module selectively indicates<br>
faults in the lAT sensor when the first counter is greater than a second<br>
predetermined value.<br>
[0011] In other features, the counter module further comprises a<br>
second counter that is incremented when either of the first and the second<br>
signals is generated. The lAT fault detection module waits to diagnose faults in<br><br>
the lAT sensor until the second counter is equal to a third predetermined value.<br>
The first counter and the second counter are reset after the second counter is<br>
equal to the third predetermined value.<br>
[0012] A method comprises measuring noise in an lAT signal from an<br>
lAT sensor in a vehicle, detemiining expected noise based upon the lAT signal,<br>
detemiining an excess noise value based upon the measured noise and the<br>
expected noise, and diagnosing faults in the lAT sensor based upon a<br>
comparison of the excess noise value and a first predetermined value.<br>
[0013] In other features, the method further comprises detenmining the<br>
expected noise further based upon a lookup table of expected noise indexed by<br>
lAT signal. In still other features, the method further comprises filtering the lAT<br>
signal and detennining the expected noise based upon the filtered lAT signal. In<br>
further features, the filtering comprises applying a first order lag filter.<br>
[0014] In other features, the method further comprises comparing the<br>
excess noise value and the first predetemiined value, generating one of a first<br>
signal and a second signal based upon the comparison, and generating the first<br>
signal when the excess noise value is greater than the first predetermined value.<br>
[0015] In further features, the method further comprises incrementing a<br>
first counter when the first signal is generated and selectively indicating faults in<br>
the lAT sensor when the first counter is greater than a second predetermined<br>
value. The method further comprises incrementing a second counter when either<br>
of the first and the second signals is generated and waiting to diagnose faults in<br>
the lAT sensor until the second counter is equal to a third predetermined value.<br><br>
The method further comprises resetting the first counter and the second counter<br>
after the second counter is equal to the third predetermined value.<br>

become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>

disclosure.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B. and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0023] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0024] Controlling an engine based upon an intake air temperature<br>
(lAT) signal from a faulty lAT sensor may cause unexpected increases or<br>
decreases In torque production and/or increases in emissions. An lAT sensor is<br>
likely faulty when the lAT signal is outside an operating range of the lAT sensor.<br>
However, the lAT sensor may be faulty despite the lAT signal falling within the<br>
operating range. In such cases, a noisy lAT signal may indicate fault in the lAT<br>
sensor. Some noise, however, may be expected even from a reliable lAT<br>
sensor. Fault in the lAT sensor may therefore be diagnosed based upon the<br>
amount of noise in the lAT signal in excess of the expected noise.<br><br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary engine system 200 is presented. The engine 102 may be any suitable<br>
type of intemai combustion engine, such as a spark ignitton type engine or a<br>
compression ignition type engine. The lAT sensor 116 generates an lAT signal,<br>
which may have been digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).<br>
Accordingly, the lAT signal may include digital values that correspond to intake<br>
air temperatures. Although the lAT signal will be discussed below as a digital<br>
signal, the lAT signal may be an analog signal.<br>
[0026] lAT has an inverse relationship with air density. Air density has<br>
a direct relationship with the amount of fuel necessary to produce a desired air-<br>
fuel ratb, such as a stoichiometric ratio. Accordingly, lAT has an inverse<br>
relationship with the amount of fuel necessary to produce the stoichiometric air-<br>
fuel ratio. For example only, for a given volume of air, as lAT increases, the<br>
amount of fuel necessary to produce the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio decreases.<br>
[0027] An engine control module (ECM) 220 may control the air-fuel<br>
ratio based upon the lAT signal and/or signals from the other sensors 122. For<br>
example only, the ECM 220 may control the air-fuel ratio by controlling the fuel<br>
injectors 110 and/or the throttle valve 108. The lAT signal of a faulty lAT sensor<br>
may be noisy. This noise may cause the ECM 220 to provide an incorrect (e.g.,<br>
non-stoichiometric) air-fuel ratio. Accordingly, fault in the lAT sensor 116 may<br>
cause an increase or decrease in torque production and/or an increase in<br>
emissbns of the engine 102.<br><br>
[0028] The lAT signal may be expected to include some noise. For<br>
example only, the expected noise in the lAT signal may increase as the (AT<br>
approaches the limits of the operating temperature range of the lAT sensor 116.<br>
This noise may be attributable to the quantization (digitization) of the lAT signal.<br>
More specifically, the lAT signal may be digitized by, for example, a non-linear<br>
ADC having a predetermined number of discrete values. The spacing between<br>
these discrete values may increase as the lAT approaches the limits of the<br>
operating temperature range. Accordingly, near the limits of the operating<br>
temperature range, small fluctuations in (AT may result in significant changes in<br>
the lAT signal.<br>
[0029] An lAT sensor diagnostic module 230 measures noise present<br>
in the I AT signal and determines expected noise of the I AT signal. The I AT<br>
sensor diagnostic module 230 determines excess noise of the lAT signal based<br>
upon the measured noise and the expected noise. The lAT sensor diagnostic<br>
module 230 diagnoses fault in the I AT sensor 116 based upon the magnitude of<br>
the excess noise and generates an lAT fault signal accordingly. The lAT fault<br>
signal indicates whether fault has been detected In the lAT sensor 116. The lAT<br>
sensor diagnostic module 230 may also indicate fault in the lAT sensor 116 when<br>
the lAT signal is outside the operating range of the lAT sensor 116.<br>
[0030] The ECM 220 may talce remedial action when fault is detected<br>
in the lAT sensor 116. For example only, when fault is detected the ECM 220<br>
may control the engine 102 based upon a modeled value of lAT and/or a<br>
secondary lAT sensor (not shown). Additionally, the ECM 220 may, for example.<br><br><br>
illuminate a "check engine light" and/or set an error flag when fault in the lAT<br>
sensor 116 is detected.<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of the lAT sensor diagnostic module 230 is presented.<br>
In various implementations, the lAT sensor diagnostic module 230 includes a<br>
filter module 302, a weighting module 304, a measured noise module 306, an<br>
excess noise module 308, a comparison module 310, an lAT fault detection<br>
module 312, and a counter module 314.<br>
[0032] The operating temperature range may be segmented into<br>
temperature bins, which are indicative of where an lAT lies within the operating<br>
temperature range. The filter module 302 provides a filtered lAT signal, which<br>
can be used to correlate the lAT signal with one of the temperature bins. The<br>
filter may be a low-pass filter or any other suitable filter. The filter module 302<br>
enhances system stability in this correlation process.<br>
[0033] In various implementations, the filter module 302 may include a<br>
first order lag filter, which may be described as:<br>
Filtered lAT = Out + (In - Out) x FC<br>
where Out is the previous output of the filter. In is the current input to the filter,<br>
and FC is the filter coefficient. The filter coefficient may be calibratable, and may<br>
be, for example, 0.1.<br>
[0034] The weighting module 304 determines a weighting factor based<br>
upon the filtered lAT. The weighting factor (e.g., 0.0-1.0) coresponds to the<br>
expected noise in the temperature bin that con-esponds to the filtered lAT.  In<br><br>
various implementations, the weighting module 304 may determine the weighting<br>
factor from a lookup table, which maps temperature bin to weighting factor.<br>
[0035] The measured noise module 306 receives the lAT signal from<br>
the lAT sensor 116 and measures the noise present in the lAT signal. For<br>
example only, the measured noise may be calculated using the equation:<br><br>
where IAT2 is a current lAT value, IAT1 is a previous lAT value, and t is the length<br>
of time between IAT2 and IAT1. In various implementations, IAT1 may be the lAT<br>
value that is received before IAT2.<br>
[0036] The excess noise module 308 determines the excess noise<br>
present in the lAT signal based upon the measured noise and the weighting<br>
factor. In various implementations, the excess noise module 308 may be a<br>
multiplier, and the excess noise may be the measured noise multiplied by the<br>
weighting factor.<br>
[0037] The comparison module 310 compares the excess noise with a<br>
first threshold and detennines whether the lAT signal is noisy based upon the<br>
comparison. The first threshold may be set to, for example, a maximum amount<br>
of excess noise allowable for a reliable lAT sensor. The comparison module 310<br>
generates a sample signal, which indicates whether the lAT signal is noisy. For<br>
example only, the comparison module 310 may indicate, via the sample signal,<br>
that the lAT signal is noisy when the excess noise is greater than the first<br>
threshold.<br><br>
[0038] A counter in the counter module 314 is incremented each time<br>
the sample signal is generated and is referred to as a total counter. The total<br>
counter tracks the number of sample signals generated. The counter module<br>
314 may also include one or more additional counters, such as a noisy sample<br>
counter. The noisy sample counter is incremented each time that the sample<br>
signal indicates that the lAT signal is noisy. Accordingly, the noisy sample<br>
counter tracks the number of sample signals that indicate that the lAT signal is<br>
noisy.<br>
[0039] The lAT fault detection module 312 may diagnose fault in the<br>
lAT sensor 116 once the total counter is equal to a second threshold. The<br>
second threshold may be calibratable and may be, for example, 200. The lAT<br>
fault detection module 312 diagnoses fault in the lAT sensor 116 based upon a<br>
comparison of the noisy sample counter with a third threshold. The third<br>
threshold may be calibratable and may be set to, for example, 150. For example<br>
only, the lAT fault detection module 312 may detect fault in the lAT sensor 116<br>
when the noisy sample counter is greater than the third threshold. The lAT fault<br>
detection module 312 generates the lAT fault signal based upon this comparison.<br>
[0040] In various implementations, the lAT fault detection module 312<br>
may indicate fault in the JAT sensor 116 without waiting for the total counter to<br>
reach the second threshold. Additionally, the lAT fault detection module 312 may<br>
receive the lAT signal and indicate fault in the lAT sensor 116 when the I AT<br>
signal is outside the operating range of the lAT sensor 116.<br><br><br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 4A, a flowchart depicting exemplary steps<br>
performed by the lAT sensor diagnostic module 230 is presented. Control<br>
begins, for example, upon starting the engine 102. In step 404, control resets the<br>
total counter and the noisy sample counter. Control may reset the total counter<br>
and the noisy sample counter to a predetermined reset value, such as zero.<br>
Control continues in step 408 where control receives the I AT signal. Control<br>
continues in step 412 where control increments the total counter.<br>
[0042] In step 416, control applies a filter to the lAT signal, thereby<br>
providing the filtered lAT signal. For example, control may apply a low-pass<br>
filter, a first order lag filter, or any other suitable filter. Control continues in step<br>
420 where control determines the expected noise of the I AT signal. Control may<br>
determine the expected noise based upon, for example, the temperature bin that<br>
corresponds to the filtered lAT signal. For example only, the expected noise may<br>
increase as the lAT approaches the limits of the operating temperature range of<br>
the lAT sensor 116.<br>
[0043] Control continues in step 424 where control measures the noise<br>
present in the lAT signal. For example only, control may calculate the measured<br>
noise using the equation:<br><br>
where IAT2 is the current lAT value, IAT1 is the previous lAT value, and t is the<br>
length of time between IAT2 and IAT1. In various implementations, IAT1 may be<br>
the lAT value that is received before IAT2.<br><br>
[0044] Control determines the excess noise present in the lAT signal in<br>
step 428. Control detemnines the excess noise based upon the measured noise<br>
and the expected noise. In step 432, control determines whether the excess<br>
noise is greater than the first threshold. If so, control continues in step 436;<br>
otherwise, control transfers to step 440.<br>
[0045] Control increments the noisy sample counter in step 436. The<br>
noisy sample counter tracks the number of times the lAT signal has been<br>
determined to be noisy. In step 440, control determines whether the total counter<br>
is ^ual to the second threshold. If so, control continues in step 444; otherwise,<br>
control retums to step 408. In this manner, control waits to diagnose fault in the<br>
lAT sensor 116 until a predetermined number of lAT signals have been received.<br>
[0046] In step 444, control determines whether the noisy sample<br>
counter is greater than or equal to the third threshold. If so. control continues in<br>
step 448; otherwise, control transfers to step 452. In step 448, control indicates<br>
fault in the lAT sensor 116 and control retums to step 404. In step 452, control<br>
indicates that fault has not been detected in the lAT sensor 116 and control<br>
retums to step 404.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 4B, another flowchart depicting exemplary<br>
steps perfomned by the lAT sensor diagnostic module 230 is presented. Control<br>
may be similar to that of FIG. 4A until step 432. In step 432, control detennines<br>
whether the excess noise is greater than the first threshold. If so, control<br>
continues in step 436; othenwise, control transfers to step 480.<br><br><br>
[0048] Control increments the noisy sample counter in step 436, and<br>
control continues in step 480. In step 480, control determines whether the noisy<br>
sample counter is greater than or equal to the third threshold. If so, control<br>
continues in step 484; otherwise, control transfers to step 488. In step 484,<br>
control indicates fault in the lAT sensor 116 and control returns to step 404. In<br>
this manner, control may indicate fault in the lAT sensor 116 before the total<br>
counter is equal to the second threshold.<br>
[0049] In step 488, control detemiines whether the total counter is<br>
equal to the second threshold. If so, control continues in step 492; othenvise,<br>
control returns to step 408. In step 492, control indicates that no fault has been<br>
detected in the I AT sensor 116, and control returns to step 404. In this manner,<br>
control may indicate that no fault has been detected only once the total counter is<br>
equal to the second threshold.<br>
[0050] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>

1.	An intake air temperature (lAT) sensor diagnostic module<br>
comprising:<br>
a measured noise module that measures noise in an lAT signal<br>
from an lAT sensor in a vehicle;<br>
an expected noise module that detemnines expected noise based<br>
upon sakj lAT signal;<br>
an excess noise module that determines an excess noise value<br>
based upon said measured noise and said expected noise; and<br>
an lAT fault detection module that diagnoses faults in said lAT<br>
sensor based upon a comparison of said excess noise value and a first<br>
predetermined value.<br>
2.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 1 wherein said expected<br>
noise module comprises a lookup table of expected noise indexed by lAT signal,<br>
and<br>
wherein said expected noise module determines said expected<br>
noise further based upon said lookup table.<br><br><br>
3.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 1 wherein said expected<br>
noise module comprises a filter module that filters said lAT signal, and<br>
wherein said expected noise module determines said expected<br>
noise based upon said filtered lAT signal.<br>
4.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 3 wherein said filter<br>
module comprises a first order lag filter.<br>
5.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 1 further comprising a<br>
comparison module that compares said excess noise value and said first<br>
predetemiined value and that generates one of a first signal and a second signal<br>
based upon said comparison,<br>
wherein said comparison module generates said first signal when<br>
said excess noise value is greater than said first predetermined value.<br>
6.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 5 further comprising a<br>
counter module having a first counter that is incremented when said first signal is<br>
generated,<br>
wherein said lAT fault detection module selectively indicates faults<br>
in said lAT sensor when said first counter is greater than a second<br>
predetermined value.<br><br><br>
7.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 6 wherein said counter<br>
module further comprises a second counter that is incremented when either of<br>
said first and said second signals is generated, and<br>
wherein said lAT fault detection module waits to diagnose faults in<br>
said lAT sensor until said second counter is equal to a third predetermined value.<br>
8.	The lAT sensor diagnostic module of claim 7 wherein said first<br>
counter and said second counter are reset after said second counter is equal to<br>
said third predetennined value.<br><br><br><br>
9.	A method comprising:<br>
measuring noise in an lAT signal from an lAT sensor in a vehicle;<br>
determining expected noise based upon said I AT signal;<br>
determining an excess noise value based upon said measured<br>
noise and said expected noise; and<br>
diagnosing faults in said lAT sensor based upon a comparison of<br>
said excess noise value and a first predetermined value.<br>
10.	The method of claim 9 further comprising determining said<br>
expected noise further based upon a lookup table of expected noise indexed by<br>
I AT signal.<br>
11.	The method of claim 9 further comprising:<br>
filtering said lAT signal; and<br>
determining said expected noise based upon said filtered lAT<br>
signal.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein said filtering comprises applying a<br>
first order lag filter.<br><br><br>
13.	The method of claim 9 further comprising:<br>
comparing said excess noise value and said first predetermined<br>
value; and<br>
generating one of a first signal and a second signal based upon<br>
said comparison,<br>
wherein said first signal is generated when said excess noise value<br>
is greater than said first predetemnined value.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 further comprising:<br>
incrementing a first counter when said first signal is generated; and<br>
selectively indicating faults in said lAT sensor when said first<br>
counter is greater than a second predetennined value.<br>
15.	The method of claim 14 further comprising:<br>
incrementing a second counter when either of said first and said<br>
second signals is generated; and<br>
waiting to diagnose faults in said lAT sensor until said second<br>
counter is equal to a third predetermined value.<br>
16.	The method of claim 15 further comprising resetting said first<br>
counter and said second counter after said second counter is equal to said third<br>
predetennined value.<br><br>
An intake air temperature (IAT) sensor diagnostic module comprises a measured noise module, an expected noise module, an excess noise module, and an IAT fault detection module. The measured noise module measures noise<br>
in an IAT signal from an IAT sensor in a vehicle. The expected noise module determines expected noise based upon the IAT signal. The excess noise module determines an excess noise value based upon the measured noise and<br>
the expected noise. The IAT fault detection module diagnoses faults in the IAT sensor based upon a comparison of the excess noise value and a first predetermined value.</td>
