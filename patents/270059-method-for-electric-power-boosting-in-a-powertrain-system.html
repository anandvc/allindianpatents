CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,272, filed on 11/04/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure is related to managing electric power within<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br><br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A powertrain system is operative to transfer power between an input<br>

device. A method for controlling the powertrain system includes monitoring<br>
operating conditions of the powertrain system, determining an electric power<br>
limit for output power of the energy storage device, selectively enabling<br>
electric power boost based upon the operating conditions of the powertrain<br>
system, and increasing the electric power limit when electric power boost is<br>
enabled.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain. The exemplary hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine<br>
14 and first and second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The<br>
engine 14 and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate<br><br>
power which can be transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated<br>
by the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and<br>
transferred to the transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor<br>
torques, referred to herein as T1, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred<br>
to herein as N1, NA, and NB, respectively.<br>
[0013] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed N1 and the input torque T1 to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0014] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br><br>
C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary<br>
devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of<br>
the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically<br>
applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
[0015] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom,<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0016] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br><br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0017] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed NO and an output<br>
torque TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed,<br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control,<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0018] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are<br>
generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br><br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0019] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br><br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0020] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br><br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0021] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality including e.g.,<br>
antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0022] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70. C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and TB for<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions<br><br>
including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and<br>
generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not<br>
shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0023] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T1,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, N|. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[00241 The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br><br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and (4 75,<br>
and rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 1 7 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0025] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0026] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0027] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM 21,<br>
and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br><br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain.<br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an<br>
event.<br>
[0028] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0029] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M1_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('M1_Eng_Off'). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off'). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('G1') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br><br><br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0030] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque<br>
generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output member<br>
64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from the user<br>
interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP 5<br>
determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque from the<br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14, clutch<br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0031] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors including,<br>
e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range state is<br>
determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br><br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state-of-charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet<br>
the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description<br>
above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br><br>
[0032] Fig. 3 details the system for controlling and managing torque and<br>
power flow in a powertrain system having multiple torque generative devices,<br>
described with reference to the hybrid powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2, and<br>
residing in the aforementioned control modules in the form of executable<br>
algorithms and calibrations. The control system architecture can be applied to<br>
any powertrain system having multiple torque generative devices, including,<br>
e.g., a hybrid powertrain system having a single electric machine, a hybrid<br>
powertrain system having multiple electric machines, and non-hybrid<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
[0033] The control system architecture of Figs. 3 depicts a flow of pertinent<br>
signals through the control modules. In operation, the operator inputs to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the<br>
operator torque request ('Toreq'). Operation of the engine 14 and the<br>
transmission 10 are monitored to determine the input speed ('Ni') and the<br>
output speed ('No'). A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic<br>
Control') 310 determines a preferred input speed ('Ni_Des') and transmission<br>
operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed<br>
and the operator torque request, and optimized based upon other operating<br>
parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and<br>
response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic optimization control scheme 310 is<br>
preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25<br>
ms loop cycle.<br><br>
[0034] The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used<br>
in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and<br>
Engine Start/Stop') 320 to command changes in the transmission operation<br>
('Transmission Commands') including changing the operating range state.<br>
This includes commanding execution of a change in the operating range state<br>
if the preferred operating range state is different from the present operating<br>
range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of the<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 and other transmission commands.<br>
The present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input<br>
speed profile ('Ni_Prof') can be determined. The input speed profile is an<br>
estimate of an upcoming input speed and preferably comprises a scalar<br>
parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle.<br>
The engine operating commands and torque request are based upon the input<br>
speed profile during a transition in the operating range state of the<br>
transmission.<br>
[0035] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the<br>
present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also<br>
include engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a<br>
cylinder deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders<br><br>
are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state<br>
and a fuel cutoff state.<br>
[0036] A clutch torque ('Tcl') for each clutch is estimated in the TCM 17,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches, and a<br>
present engine input torque ('Ti') reacting with the input member 12 is<br>
determined in the ECM 23. An output and motor torque determination<br>
scheme ('Output and Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to<br>
determine the preferred output torque from the powertrain ('To_cmd'), which<br>
includes motor torque commands ('TA' and 'TB') for controlling the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred output<br>
torque is based upon the estimated clutch torque(s) for each of the clutches,<br>
the present input torque from the engine 14, the present operating range state,<br>
the input speed, the operator torque request, and the input speed profile. The<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled through the TPIM<br>
19 to meet the preferred motor torque commands based upon the preferred<br>
output torque. The output and motor torque determination scheme 340<br>
includes algorithmic code which is regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and<br>
12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0037] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to generate tractive<br>
torque at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the<br>
operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position<br>
of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Preferably, forwardly propelling the vehicle results in<br><br>
vehicle forward acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient to<br>
overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade, aerodynamic<br>
loads, and other loads.<br>
[00381 In operation, operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and to the<br>
brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request.<br>
Present speeds of the output member 64 and the input member 12, i.e., No and<br>
Ni, are determined. A present operating range state of the transmission 14 and<br>
present engine states are determined. Maximum and minimum electric power<br>
limits of the electric energy storage device 74 are determined.<br>
[0039] Blended brake torque includes a combination of the friction braking<br>
torque generated at the wheels 93 and the output torque generated at the output<br>
member 64 which reacts with the driveline 90 to decelerate the vehicle in<br>
response to the operator input to the brake pedal 112.<br>
[00401 The BrCM 22 commands the friction brakes on the wheels 93 to<br>
apply braking force and generates a command for the transmission 10 to create<br>
a change in output torque which reacts with the driveline 90 in response to a<br>
net operator input to the brake pedal 112 and the accelerator pedal 113.<br>
Preferably the applied braking force and the negative output torque can<br>
decelerate and stop the vehicle so long as they are sufficient to overcome<br>
vehicle kinetic power at wheel(s) 93. The negative output torque reacts with<br>
the driveline 90, thus transferring torque to the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 and the engine 14. The negative output torque reacted<br>
through the electro-mechanical transmission 10 can be transferred to the first<br><br><br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate electric power for storage<br>
in the ESD 74.<br>
[0041] The operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal<br>
112 together with torque intervention controls comprise individually<br>
determinable operator torque request inputs including an immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel Immed'), a<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel<br>
Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output Torque Request<br>
Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type ('Axle Torque<br>
Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers to an operator<br>
request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing vehicle speed<br>
over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction, and a similar reverse propulsion response when the vehicle<br>
operation is commanded in the reverse direction. The terms 'deceleration' and<br>
'brake' refer to an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle<br>
speed from the present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output<br>
torque request, the predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate<br>
brake output torque request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the<br>
axle torque response type are individual inputs to the control system.<br>
[0042] The immediate accelerator output torque request comprises an<br>
immediate torque request determined based upon the operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and torque intervention controls. The control system<br><br>
controls the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system in response to<br>
the immediate accelerator output torque request to cause positive acceleration<br>
of the vehicle. The immediate brake output torque request comprises an<br>
immediate braking request determined based upon the operator input to the<br>
brake pedal 112 and torque intervention controls. The control system controls<br>
the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system in response to the<br>
immediate brake output torque request to cause deceleration of the vehicle.<br>
Vehicle deceleration effected by control of the output torque from the hybrid<br>
powertrain system is combined with vehicle deceleration effected by a vehicle<br>
braking system (not shown) to decelerate the vehicle to achieve the operator<br>
braking request.<br>
[0043] The immediate accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon a presently occurring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. and<br>
comprises a request to generate an immediate output torque at the output<br>
member 64 preferably to accelerate the vehicle. The immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request may be modified by torque intervention controls based<br>
on events that affect vehicle operation outside the powertrain control. Such<br>
events include vehicle level interruptions in the powertrain control for antilock<br>
braking, traction control and vehicle stability control, which can be used to<br>
modify the immediate accelerator output torque request.<br>
[0044] The predicted accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an<br>
optimum or preferred output torque at the output member 64. The predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request is preferably equal to the immediate<br><br>
accelerator output torque request during normal operating conditions, e.g.,<br>
when torque intervention controls is not being commanded. When torque<br>
intervention , e.g., any one of antilock braking, traction control or vehicle<br>
stability, is being is commanded, the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request can remain the preferred output torque with the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request being decreased in response to output torque commands<br>
related to the torque intervention.<br>
[0045] The immediate brake output torque request and the predicted brake<br>
output torque request are both blended brake torque requests. Blended brake<br>
torque includes a combination of the friction braking torque generated at the<br>
wheels 93 and the output torque generated at the output member 64 which<br>
reacts with the driveline 90 to decelerate the vehicle in response to the<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112.<br>
[0046] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based upon<br>
a presently occurring operator input to the brake pedal 112, and comprises a<br>
request to generate an immediate output torque at the output member 64 to<br>
effect a reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably decelerates the<br>
vehicle. The immediate brake output torque request is determined based upon<br>
the operator input to the brake pedal 112, and the control signal to control the<br>
friction brakes to generate friction braking torque.<br>
[0047] The predicted brake output torque request comprises an optimum or<br>
preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in response to an<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of the operator<br><br>
input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g. The predicted<br>
brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when vehicle speed<br>
approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake pedal 112. As<br>
desired, there can be operating conditions under which the predicted brake<br>
output torque request is set to zero, e.g., when the operator setting to the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 is set to a reverse gear, and when a transfer case<br>
(not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive low range. The operating conditions<br>
whereat the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero are those in<br>
which blended braking is not preferred due to vehicle operating factors.<br>
[0048] The axle torque response type comprises an input state for shaping<br>
and rate-limiting the output torque response through the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The input state for the axle torque response type<br>
can be an active state or an inactive state. When the commanded axle torque<br>
response type is an active state, the output torque command is the immediate<br>
output torque. Preferably the torque response for this response type is as fast<br>
as possible.<br>
[0049] The predicted accelerator output torque request and the predicted<br>
brake output torque request are input to the strategic optimization control<br>
scheme ('Strategic Control') 310. The strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310 determines a desired operating range state for the transmission 10<br>
('Hybrid Range State Des') and a desired input speed from the engine 14 to<br>
the transmission 10 ('Ni Des'), which comprise inputs to the shift execution<br><br><br>
and engine operating state control scheme ('Shift Execution and Engine<br>
Start/Stop') 320.<br>
[0050] A change in the input torque from the engine 14 which reacts with the<br>
input member from the transmission 10 can be effected by changing mass of<br>
intake air to the engine 14 by controlling position of an engine throttle<br>
utilizing an electronic throttle control system (not shown), including opening<br>
the engine throttle to increase engine torque and closing the engine throttle to<br>
decrease engine torque. Changes in the input torque from the engine 14 can<br>
be effected by adjusting ignition timing, including retarding spark timing from<br>
a mean-best-torque spark timing to decrease engine torque. The engine state<br>
can be changed between the engine-off state and the engine-on state to effect a<br>
change in the input torque. The engine state can be changed between the all-<br>
cylinder operating state and the cylinder deactivation operating state, wherein<br>
a portion of the engine cylinders are unfueled. The engine state can be<br>
changed by selectively operating the engine 14 in one of the fueled state and<br>
the fuel cutoff state wherein the engine is rotating and unfueled. Executing a<br>
shift in the transmission 10 from a first operating range state to a second<br>
operating range state can be commanded and achieved by selectively applying<br>
and deactivating the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75.<br>
[0051] The immediate accelerator output torque request, the predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque request,<br>
the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque response type<br>
are inputs to the tactical control and operation scheme 330 to determine the<br>
engine command comprising the preferred input torque to the engine 14.<br><br>
[0052] The tactical control and operation scheme 330 can be divided into<br>
two parts. This includes determining a desired engine torque, and therefore a<br>
power split between the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, and controlling the engine states and operation of the engine 14 to<br>
meet the desired engine torque. The engine states include the all-cylinder state<br>
and the cylinder deactivation state, and a fueled state and a deceleration fuel<br>
cutoff state for the present operating range state and the present engine speed.<br>
The tactical control and operation scheme 330 monitors the predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request and the predicted brake output torque request<br>
to determine the predicted input torque request. The immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request and the immediate brake output torque request are used<br>
to control the engine speed/load operating point to respond to operator inputs<br>
to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112, e.g., to determine the<br>
engine command comprising the preferred input torque to the engine 14.<br>
Preferably, a rapid change in the preferred input torque to the engine 14 occurs<br>
only when the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 cannot meet the<br>
operator torque request.<br>
[0053] The immediate accelerator output torque request, the immediate<br>
brake output torque request, and the axle torque response type are input to the<br>
motor torque control scheme ('Output and Motor Torque Determination1) 340.<br>
The motor torque control scheme 340 executes to determine the motor torque<br>
commands during each iteration of one of the loop cycles, preferably the 6.25<br>
ms loop cycle.<br><br><br>
[0054] The present input torque ('Ti') from the engine 14 and the estimated<br>
clutch torque(s) ('Tcl') are input to the motor torque control scheme 340. The<br>
axle torque response type signal determines the torque response characteristics<br>
of the output torque command delivered to the output member 64 and hence to<br>
the driveline 90.<br>
[0055] The motor torque control scheme 340 controls motor torque<br>
commands of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to transfer a net<br>
commanded output torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that<br>
meets the operator torque request. The control system architecture controls<br>
power flow among power actuators within a hybrid powertrain. The hybrid<br>
powertrain utilizes two or more power actuators to provide output power to an<br>
output member. Controlling power flow among the power actuators includes<br>
controlling the input speed N1 from the engine 14, the input torque T1 from the<br>
engine, and the motor torques TA, TB of the first and second electric machines<br>
56, 72. Although in the exemplary embodiment described herein above, the<br>
hybrid powertrain utilizes the control system architecture to control power<br>
flow among power actuators including the engine 14, the ESD 74 and the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, in alternate embodiments the control<br>
system architecture can control power flow among other types of power<br>
actuators. Exemplary power actuators that can be utilized include fuel cells,<br>
ultra-capacitors and hydraulic actuators.<br>
[0056] The control system architecture manages electric power within the<br>
exemplary powertrain system utilizing electric power limits. This includes<br>
monitoring voltage ('VBAT') and power ('PBAT') of the ESD 74. The control<br><br>
system architecture utilizes a method for managing electric power within the<br>
powertrain system that includes establishing predicted electric power limits,<br>
long-term electric power limits, short-term electric power limits, and voltage-<br>
based electric power limits. The method further includes determining a<br>
preferred input speed from the engine 14, a preferred input torque from the<br>
engine 14, a preferred engine state, and a preferred operating range state of the<br>
transmission 10 utilizing the predicted electric power limits. The method<br>
further includes determining input torque constraints for constraining input<br>
torque from the engine 14 and output torque constraints for constraining<br>
output torque To to the output member 64 based upon the long-term electric<br>
power limits and the short-term electric power limits. By constraining the<br>
output torque To, a total motor torque TM, consisting of first and second motor<br>
torques TA and TB of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72,<br>
respectively, is also constrained based on the set of output torque constraints<br>
and the input torque T1 from the engine 14. In an alternate embodiment, a set<br>
of total motor torque constraints can be determined based upon the long-term<br>
electric power limits and short-term electric power limits, in addition to, or<br>
instead of the set of output torque constraints. The method further includes<br>
determining output torque constraints based upon the voltage-based electric<br>
power limits.<br>
[0057] The predicted electric power limits comprise preferred battery output<br>
levels associated with preferred ESD 74 performance levels, that is, the<br>
predicted electric power limits prescribe the desired operating envelope of the<br>
ESD 74. The predicted electric power limits comprise a range of battery<br><br>
output power levels from a minimum predicted electric power limit<br>
('PBAT MIN_PRDTD') to a maximum predicted electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX<br>
PRDTD'). The predicted electric power limits can comprise a more constrained<br>
range of battery output power levels than the long-term electric power limits<br>
and the short-term electric power limits.<br>
[0058] The long-term electric power limits comprise battery output power<br>
levels associated with operation of the ESD 74 while maintaining long-term<br>
durability of the ESD 74. Operation of the ESD 74 outside the long-term<br>
electric power limits for extended periods of time may reduce the operational<br>
life of the ESD 74. In one embodiment, the ESD 74 is maintained within the<br>
long-term electric power limits during steady-state operation, that is, operation<br>
not associated with transient operation. Exemplary transient operations<br>
include tip-in and tip-out of the accelerator pedal 113, wherein transient<br>
acceleration operation is requested. Maintaining the ESD 74 within the long-<br>
term electric power limits, allows the ESD 74 to provide functionality such as<br>
delivering a highest power level that does not degrade operational life of the<br>
ESD 74. The long-term electric power limits comprise a range of battery<br>
output power levels from a minimum long-term electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MIN_LT') to a maximum long-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_LT').<br>
The long-term electric power limits can comprise a more constrained range of<br>
battery output power levels than the short-term electric power limits.<br>
[0059] The short-term electric power limits comprise ESD 74 output power<br>
levels associated with battery operation that does not significantly affect short-<br>
term battery durability. Operation of the ESD 74 outside the short-term<br><br>
electric power limits may reduce the operational life of the ESD 74. Operating<br>
the ESD 74 within the short-term electric power limits, but outside the long-<br>
term electric power limits for short periods of time, may minimally reduce the<br>
operational life of the ESD 74, however, does not result in large amounts of<br>
degraded operational performance to the ESD 74, In one embodiment, the<br>
ESD 74 is maintained within the short-term electric power limits during<br>
transient operation. The short-term electric power limits comprise a range of<br>
battery output power levels from a minimum short-term electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MIN_ST') to a maximum short-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_ST')<br>
[0060] The voltage-based electric power limits comprise a range of battery<br>
output power from a minimum voltage-based electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MAX_VB') to a maximum voltage-based electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MAX_VB) based on desired operating voltages of the ESD 74. The<br>
minimum voltage-based electric power limit PBAT_MIN_VB is a minimum<br>
amount of battery output power that the ESD 74 outputs before reaching a<br>
maximum voltage VBAT_MAX_BASE. The maximum voltage-based electric<br>
power limit PBAT_MAX_VB is an estimated amount battery output power from the<br>
ESD 74 before reaching a minimum voltage VBAT_MIN_BASE. The minimum<br>
voltage VBAT_MIN_BASE is a minimum permissible voltage for operating the<br>
battery without significantly affecting short-term battery durability.<br>
Outputting power from the ESD 74 when the voltage levels of the ESD 74 are<br>
below the minimum VBAT_MIN_BASE can cause degraded operational life of the<br>
ESD 74.<br><br><br>
[0061] The tactical control scheme 330 determines a set of tactical control<br>
electric power constraints based upon the short-term electric power limits and<br>
the long-term electric power limits. In particular, the tactical control scheme<br>
330 sets the tactical control electric power constraints to the long-term electric-<br>
power limits, when the battery output power of the ESD 74 is within a<br>
preferred tactical control battery output power operating range, wherein the<br>
preferred tactical control battery output power operating range is defined<br>
based upon the short-term electric power limits. When the battery output<br>
power is outside the preferred tactical control battery output power operating<br>
range, the tactical control scheme 330 utilizes feedback control based upon the<br>
battery output power and the short-term electric power limits to modify the<br>
tactical control electric power constraints to control battery output power PBAT<br>
within the preferred tactical control battery output power operating range<br>
[0062] The set of tactical control electric power constraints are utilized to<br>
determine a set of input torque constraints for the tactical control scheme 330.<br>
When the preferred input torque as determined by the optimization function is<br>
within the set of input torque constraints, the tactical control scheme 330<br>
requests the preferred input torque from the engine 14, and the engine 14<br>
controls the input torque T1 to the preferred input torque, e.g., by adjusting<br>
engine fueling and/or adjusting position of an engine throttle . When the<br>
preferred input torque is outside the set of input torque constraints, the tactical<br>
control scheme requests the violated constraint for input torque from the<br>
engine 14, and the engine 14 adjusts combustion timing to control input torque<br>
within the input torque constraints.<br><br>
[0063] Fig. 4 details signal flow for the output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 for controlling and managing the output torque<br>
through the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, described with<br>
reference to the hybrid powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2 and the control<br>
system architecture of Figs. 3 and constraints include the maximum and<br>
minimum available battery power limits ('Pbat Min/Max'). The output and<br>
motor torque determination scheme 340 controls the motor torque commands<br>
of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to transfer a net output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that reacts with the<br>
driveline 90 and meets the operator torque request, subject to constraints and<br>
shaping. The output and motor torque determination scheme 340 preferably<br>
includes algorithmic code and predetermined calibration code which is<br>
regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine<br>
preferred motor torque commands ('TA' 'TB') for controlling the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment.<br>
[0064] The output and motor torque determination scheme 340 determines<br>
and uses a plurality of inputs to determine constraints on the output torque,<br>
from which it determines the output torque command ('To_cmd'). Motor<br>
torque commands ('TA', 'TB') for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 can be determined based upon the output torque command. The inputs<br>
to the output and motor torque determination scheme 340 include operator<br>
inputs, powertrain system inputs and constraints, and autonomic control<br>
inputs.<br><br>
[0065] The operator inputs include the immediate accelerator output torque<br>
request ('Output Torque Request Accel mimed') and the immediate brake<br>
output torque request ('Output Torque Request Brake Immed').<br>
[0066] The autonomic control inputs include torque offsets to effect active<br>
damping of the driveline 90 (412), to effect engine pulse cancellation (408),<br>
and to effect a closed loop correction based upon the input and output speeds<br>
(410). The torque offsets for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
to effect active damping of the driveline 90 can be determined ('Ta AD','Tb<br>
AD'), e.g., to manage and effect driveline lash adjustment, and are output<br>
from an active damping algorithm ('AD') (412). The torque offsets to effect<br>
engine pulse cancellation ('Ta PC, 'Tb PC) are determined during starting<br>
and stopping of the engine during transitions between the engine-on state<br>
('ON') and the engine-off state ('OFF') to cancel engine torque disturbances,<br>
and are output from a pulse cancellation algorithm ('PC') (408). The torque<br>
offsets for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to effect closed-<br>
loop correction torque are determined by monitoring input speed to the<br>
transmission 10 and clutch slip speeds of clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. When operating in one of the mode operating range states, the closed-<br>
loop correction torque offsets for the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 ('Ta CL', 'Tb CL') can be determined based upon a difference between the<br>
input speed from sensor 11 ('Ni') and the input speed profile ('Ni_Prof').<br>
When operating in Neutral, the closed-loop correction is based upon the<br>
difference between the input speed from sensor 11 ('Ni') and the input speed<br>
profile ('Ni_Prof'), and a difference between a clutch slip speed and a targeted<br><br>
clutch slip speed, e.g.. a clutch slip speed profile for a targeted clutch C1 70<br>
The closed-loop correction torque offsets are output from a closed loop control<br>
algorithm ('CL') (410). Clutch torque(s) ('Tcl') comprising clutch reactive<br>
torque range(s) for the applied torque transfer clutch(es), and unprocessed<br>
clutch slip speeds and clutch slip accelerations of the non-applied clutches can<br>
be determined for the specific operating range state for any of the presently<br>
applied and non-locked clutches. The closed-loop motor torque offsets and<br>
the motor torque offsets to effect active damping of the driveline 90 are input<br>
to a low pass filter to determine motor torque corrections for the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TA LPF' and TB LPF') (405).<br>
[0067] A battery power control function ('Battery Power Control') 466<br>
monitors battery power inputs to determine electric power constraints<br>
comprising a maximum motor torque control electric power constraint ('PBAT<br>
MAX_MT') and a minimum motor torque control electric power constraint ('PBAT<br>
_MIN_MT') that is input to an optimization algorithm 440 to determine minimum<br>
and maximum raw output torque constraints ('To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw').<br>
Inputs to the battery power control function 466 include battery voltage<br>
('VBAT'), battery power ('PBAT'), the maximum voltage VBAT_MAX_BASE, the<br>
minimum voltage VBAT_MIN_BASE, a maximum long-term electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MAX_LT'). a minimum long-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MIN_LT'), a<br>
maximum short term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_ST'), and minimum short<br>
term electric power limit ('PBAT_MIN_ST').<br>
[0068] Other system inputs include the operating range state ('Hybrid Range<br>
State') and a plurality of system inputs and constraints ('System Inputs and<br><br>
Constraints'). The system inputs can include scalar parameters specific to the<br>
powertrain system and the operating range state, and can be related to speed<br>
and acceleration of the input member 12, output member 64, and the clutches.<br>
Other system inputs are related to system inertias, damping, and<br>
electric/mechanical power conversion efficiencies in this embodiment. The<br>
constraints include maximum and minimum motor torque outputs from the<br>
torque machines, i.e., first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (Ta<br>
Min/Max', 'Tb Min/Max'), a|nd maximum and minimum clutch reactive<br>
torques for the applied clutches. Other system inputs include the input torque,<br>
clutch slip speeds and other relevant states.<br>
[0069] Inputs including an input acceleration profile ('Nidot_Prof) and a<br>
clutch slip acceleration profile ('Clutch Slip Accel Prof) are input to a pre-<br>
optimization algorithm (415), along with the system inputs, the operating<br>
range state, and the motor torque corrections for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 ('TA LPF' and 'TB LPF'). The input acceleration profile<br>
is an estimate of an upcoming input acceleration that preferably comprises a<br>
targeted input acceleration for the forthcoming loop cycle. The clutch slip<br>
acceleration profile is an estimate of upcoming clutch acceleration for one or<br>
more of the non-applied clutches, and preferably comprises a targeted clutch<br>
slip acceleration for the forthcoming loop cycle. Optimization inputs ('Opt<br>
Inputs'), which can include values for motor torques, clutch torques and<br>
output torques can be calculated for the present operating range state and used<br>
in an optimization algorithm to determine the maximum and minimum raw<br>
output torque constraints (440) and to determine the preferred split of open-<br><br>
loop torque commands between the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 (440'). The optimization inputs, the maximum and minimum battery power<br>
limits, the system inputs and the present operating range state are analyzed to<br>
determine a preferred or optimum output torque ('To Opt') and minimum and<br>
maximum raw output torque constraints ('To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw')<br>
(440), which can be shaped add filtered (420). The preferred output torque<br>
('To Opt') comprises an output torque that minimizes battery power subject to<br>
the operator torque request. The immediate accelerator output torque request<br>
and the immediate brake output torque request are each shaped and filtered<br>
and subjected to the minimum and maximum output torque constraints ('To<br>
Min Filt', 'To Max Fill:') to determine minimum and maximum filtered output<br>
torque request constraints ('To Min Req Filtd', 'To Max Req Filtd'). A<br>
constrained accelerator output torque request ('To Req Accel Cnstrnd') and a<br>
constrained brake output torque request ('To Req Brake Cnstrnd') can be<br>
determined based upon the minimum and maximum filtered output torque<br>
request constraints (425).<br>
[0070] Furthermore, a regenerative braking capacity ('Opt Regen Capacity')<br>
of the transmission 10 comprises a capacity of the transmission 10 to react<br>
driveline torque, and can be determined based upon constraints including<br>
maximum and minimum motor torque outputs from the torque machines and<br>
maximum and minimum reactive torques for the applied clutches, taking into<br>
account the battery power limits. The regenerative braking capacity<br>
establishes a maximum value for; the immediate brake output torque request.<br>
The regenerative braking capacity is determined based upon a difference<br><br><br>
between the constrained accelerator output torque request and the preferred<br>
output torque. The constrained accelerator output torque request is shaped and<br>
filtered and combined with the constrained brake output torque request to<br>
determine a net output torque command. The net output torque command is<br>
compared to the minimum and maximum request filtered output torques to<br>
determine the output torque command ('To_cmd') (430). When the net output<br>
torque command is between the maximum and minimum request filtered<br>
output torques, the output torque command is set to the net output torque<br>
command. When the net output torque command exceeds the maximum<br>
request filtered output torque, the output torque command is set to the<br>
maximum request filtered output torque. When the net output torque<br>
command is less than the minimum request filtered output torque, the output<br>
torque command is set to the minimum request filtered output torque<br>
command.<br>
[0071] Powertrain operation is monitored and combined with the output<br>
torque command to determine a preferred split of open-loop torque commands<br>
between the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 that meets reactive<br>
clutch torque capacities ('TA Opt' and 'TB Opt'), and provide feedback related<br>
to the preferred battery power ('Pbat Opt') (440'). The motor torque<br>
corrections for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TA LPF' and<br>
TB LPF') are subtracted to determine open loop motor torque commands ('TA<br>
OL'and 'TBOL")(460).<br>
[0072] The open loop motor torque commands are combined with the<br>
autonomic control inputs including the torque offsets to effect active damping<br><br>
of the driveline 90 (412), to effect engine pulse cancellation (408), and to<br>
effect a closed loop correction based upon the input and clutch slip speeds<br>
(410), to determine the motor torques TA and TB for controlling the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 (470). The aforementioned steps of<br>
constraining, shaping and filtering the output torque request to determine the<br>
output torque command which is converted into the torque commands for the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 is preferably a feed-forward<br>
operation which acts upon the inputs and uses algorithmic code to calculate<br>
the torque commands.<br>
[0073] The system operation as configured leads to determining output<br>
torque constraints based upon present operation and constraints of the<br>
powertrain system. The operator torque request is determined based upon<br>
operator inputs to the brake pedal and to the accelerator pedal. The operator<br>
torque request can be constrained, shaped and filtered to determine the output<br>
torque command, including determining a preferred regenerative braking<br>
capacity. An output torque command can be determined that is constrained<br>
based upon the constraints and the operator torque request. The output torque<br>
command is implemented by commanding operation of the torque machines.<br>
The system operation effects powertrain operation that is responsive to the<br>
operator torque request and within system constraints. The system operation<br>
results in an output torque shaped with reference to operator drivability<br>
demands, including smooth operation during regenerative braking operation.<br>
[0074] The optimization algorithm (440, 440') comprises an algorithm<br>
executed to determine powertrain system control parameters that are<br><br>
responsive to the operator torque request that minimizes battery power<br>
consumption. The optimization algorithm 440 includes monitoring present<br>
operating conditions of the electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain, e.g., the<br>
powertrain system described hereinabove, based upon the system inputs and<br>
constraints, the present operating range state, and the available battery power<br>
limits. For a candidate input torque, the optimization algorithm 440 calculates<br>
powertrain system outputs that are responsive to the system inputs comprising<br>
the aforementioned output torque commands and are within the maximum and<br>
minimum motor torque outputs from the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72, and within the available battery power, and within the range of clutch<br>
reactive torques from the applied clutches for the present operating range state<br>
of the transmission 10, and take into account the system inertias, damping,<br>
clutch slippages, and electric/mechanical power conversion efficiencies.<br>
Preferably, the powertrain system outputs include the preferred output torque<br>
('To Opt'), achievable torque outputs from the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 ('Ta Opt', 'Tb Opt') and the preferred battery power<br>
('Pbat Opt') associated with the achievable torque outputs.<br>
[0075] Fig. 5 shows added details of the battery power control function 466.<br>
The battery power control function 466 determines electric power constraints<br>
including the minimum motor torque control electric power constraint<br>
('PBAT_MIN_MT') and the maximum motor torque control electric power<br>
constraint ('PBAT_MAX_MT'). The battery power control function 466 includes<br>
an electric power boost limit function ('Electric Power Boost Limit Function')<br><br><br>
496, a charge function ('Ovier Discharge and Over Charge Function') 492 and<br>
a voltage function ('Over Voltage and Under Voltage Function') 494.<br>
[0076] Fig. 6 depicts the dectric power boost limit function 496 (' Electric<br>
Power Boost Limit Function'), and Fig. 7 depicts electric power levels<br>
('Power') of the electric power boost limit function 496 along with a delayed<br>
electric power boost signal ('Delay Boost Allow') plotted as function of<br>
elapsed time ('Time').<br>
[0077] The electric power boost limit function 496 includes an electric<br>
power boost enablement determination function 510 ('Electric Power Boost<br>
Enablement Determination'), The electric boost enablement determination<br>
function 510 inputs signals to determine whether the powertrain system is in a<br>
state in which allowing electric power boost is desirable, for example, when<br>
energy from the energy storage device will not be drained to undesirable levels<br>
when allowing electric power boost. Signals indicating that allowing electric<br>
power boost is desirable include signals indicating that the state-of-charge of<br>
the ESD 74 is greater than a threshold state-of-charge, the cylinder<br>
deactivation engine state is requested, the engine torque is greater than the<br>
threshold engine torque, and one of the engine starting cycle and the engine<br>
stopping cycle is active.<br>
[0078] The state-of-charge ('State-of-Charge') of the ESD 74 is monitored<br>
by the BPCM 21 and compared to a threshold state of charge in a state-of-<br>
charge comparison function ('State-of-Charge Comparison') 506. When the<br>
state-of-charge is greater than the threshold state-of-charge, the state of charge<br>
comparison function 506 outputs a boolean signal indicating that the state-of-<br><br>
charge of the ESD 74 is greater than the threshold state-of-charge ('State-of-<br>
Charge&gt;Threshold State-of-Charge'). Engine torque ('Engine Torque") is<br>
monitored and compared to a threshold engine torque ('Engine Torque<br>
Maximum') using a comparison function ('Engine Torque Comparison') 508.<br>
The engine torque comparison function 508 generates a signal based on a<br>
hysteresis determination of that engine torque less than the engine torque<br>
threshold ('Engine Torque 
optimization function 330 outputs a signal requesting cylinder deactivation<br>
('Cylinder Deactivation Requested') and the shift execution and engine<br>
start/stop control scheme 320 outputs a signal indicating that one of an engine<br>
starting cycle and engine stopping cycle is active ('Engine Start/Stop Active').<br>
[0079] When the electric boost enablement determination function 510<br>
receives at least one of the aforementioned signals indicating that allowing<br>
electric power boost is desirable, the boost enablement determination function<br>
sets an electric power boost signal ('Boost Enablement') to indicate electric<br>
power boost is enabled. When the boost enablement function 510 does not<br>
receive at least one of the signals indicating that allowing electric power boost<br>
is desirable, the electronic boost enablement determination function 510 sets<br>
the electric power boost signal to indicate electric power boost is disabled and<br>
boost limiting is desirable.<br>
[0080] A time delay determination function ('Time Delay Determination')<br>
512 determines a time delay ('Time Delay') based upon the output speed NO<br>
of the transmission 10. A delayed electric power boost determination function<br>
('Delay Electric Power Boost Enablement Determination') 514 determines a<br><br>
delayed electric power boost signal as the electric power boost signal offset by<br>
the time delay when the boost enablement signal transitions from off to on.<br>
The delayed electric boost determination function 514 determines the delayed<br>
electric boost signal as the electric boost signal when the boost enablement<br>
signal transitions from on to off.<br>
[0081] A ramp down rate determination function ('Ramp Down Rate<br>
Determination') 520 inputs the output speed NO of the transmission 10 and<br>
determines a ramp down rate ('Ramp Down Rate') that is a rate of decrease in<br>
electric power based upon the output speed NO of the transmission 10. The<br>
ramp down rate, the delayed boost signal, and a ramp up rate ('Ramp UP<br>
Rate') are provided to a decision block 522. If the delayed boost signal<br>
indicates electric power boost is enabled, the decision block 522 outputs the<br>
ramp up rate as a ramp rate ('Ramp Rate'). If the delayed boost enablement<br>
signal indicates that electric power boost is disabled, the decision block 522<br>
outputs the ramp down rate as the ramp rate.<br>
[0082] A summation function 524 inputs the ramp rate and modifies a boost<br>
function maximum long-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_LT_BF(k-<br>
1)') at time k1 to determine an initial maximum long-term electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MAX_LT_I').<br>
[0083] A pinched electric power limit determination function 516 ('Pinch<br>
Limit Determination') determines a pinched maximum long-term electric<br>
power limit ('PBAT_MAX_LT_P') as the greater of the minimum long term<br>
electric power limit ('PBAT_MIN_LT') and zero. The pinched maximum<br>
long-term electric power limit, the initial maximum long-term electric power<br><br>
limit, and the maximum long-term electric power limit are inputted into the<br>
boost function maximum long-term electric power limit determination<br>
function 526. If the initial long-term electric power limit is between the<br>
maximum long-term electric power limit and the pinched maximum long-term<br>
electric power limit, the boost function maximum long-term electric power<br>
limit determination function 526 sets the boost function maximum long-term<br>
electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_LT_BF') to the initial maximum long-<br>
term electric power limit. If the initial maximum long-term electric power<br>
limit is less than the pinched maximum long-term electric power limit, the<br>
boost function maximum long-term electric power limit determination<br>
function 526 sets the boost fuinction maximum long-term electric power limit<br>
to the pinch maximum long-term electric power limit. If the initial maximum<br>
long-term electric power limit is greater than the boost maximum long-term<br>
electric power limit, the boost function maximum long-term electric power<br>
limit determination function 526 sets the boost function maximum long-term<br>
electric power limit to the maximum long-term electric power limit. The<br>
boost function maximum long-term electric power limit is stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums ('Stored (k-1)') (528).<br>
[0084] The charge function 492 inputs the actual battery output power<br>
('PBAT') of the ESD 74, the minimum short-term electric power limit<br>
('PBAT_MIN_ST'), the maximum short-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_ST')<br>
the minimum long-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MIN_LT'), the boost function<br>
maximum long-term electric power limit ('PBAT_MAX_LT_BF'), and the preferred<br>
battery power ('PBAT_OPT')- The charge function 492 outputs a minimum<br><br>
charge function electric power constraint ('PBAT_MIN_CF') and a maximum<br>
charge function electric power constraint ('PBAT_MAX_CF') The charge<br>
function 492 determines a set of preferred electric power limits comprising an<br>
upper preferred electric power limit (not shown) and a lower preferred electric<br>
power limit (not shown) based on the short-term electric power limits.<br>
[0085] When the actual battery output power PBAT of the ESD 74 is between<br>
the upper preferred electric power limit and the lower preferred electric power<br>
limit, the minimum charge function and the maximum charge function electric<br>
power constraints output from the charge function 492 comprise the minimum<br>
long-term electric power limit and the boost function maximum long-term<br>
electric power limit, respectively. When the actual battery output power PBAT<br>
of the ESD 74 is not between the upper and lower preferred electric power<br>
limits, the minimum charge function and the maximum charge function<br>
electric power constraints are determined in the charge function 492 based on<br>
a change rate value, the minirhum long-term electric power limit, the boost<br>
function maximum long-term electric power limit, and the preferred battery<br>
power PBAT_OPT. The change rate value feedback control is determined when<br>
the actual battery output power PBAT of the ESD 74 transgresses one of the<br>
upper preferred electric power limit and the lower preferred electric power<br>
limit based upon an error between the actual battery power PBAT of the ESD 74<br>
and the transgressed one of the upper preferred electric power limit and the<br>
lower preferred electric power limit.<br>
[0086] As the charge function 492 adjusts one of the maximum charge<br>
function electric power constraint and the minimum charge function electric<br><br>
power constraint based on the actual battery output power PBAT of the ESD 74,<br>
the power constraint determination function 504 also adjusts the other charge<br>
function electric power constraint by the same amount, therefore, the<br>
difference between the maximum and minimum charge function electric<br>
power constraints remain unchanged.<br>
[0087] The minimum and maximum charge function electric power<br>
constraints are intermediate electric power constraint values utilized to<br>
determine the final electric power constraint values, that is, the minimum<br>
motor torque control electric power constraint ("PBAT_MIN_MT') and the<br>
maximum motor torque control electric power constraint ('PBAT_MAX_MT')-<br>
[0088] Inputs to the voltage function 494 include actual battery voltage<br>
('VBAT') of the ESD 74 monitored by the BPCM 21, the minimum base<br>
voltage limit ('VBAT_MIN_BASE') for the ESD 74, the maximum base voltage<br>
limit ('VBAT MAX_BASE') for the ESD 74, the charge function maximum electric<br>
power constraint ('PBAT_MAX_CF'), the charge function minimum electric power<br>
constraint ('PBAT_MIN_CF'), and the preferred battery power ('PBAT_OPT'). The<br>
minimum and maximum base voltage limits define an operating range for the<br>
voltage of the ESD 74 and can be determined based on parameters of the<br>
powertrain system including, for example, the temperature of the ESD 74.<br>
[0089] The voltage function 494 determines a set of preferred voltage limits<br>
comprising an upper preferred voltage limit (not shown) and a lower preferred<br>
voltage limit (not shown) based on the maximum base voltage limit and the<br>
minimum base voltage limit, respectively.<br><br>
[0090] When the actual battery voltage VBAT of the ESD 74 is between the<br>
upper preferred voltage limit and the lower voltage power limit, the voltage<br>
function 494 sets the maximum motor torque control electric power constraint<br>
('PBAT_ MAX_MT') and a minimum motor torque control electric power<br>
constraint ('PBAT_MIN_MT') to be the maximum charge function electric power<br>
constraint and the minimum charge function electric power constraint,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0091] When the actual battery voltage VBAT of the ESD 74 is not between<br>
the upper preferred electric power limit and the lower preferred electric power<br>
limit, the voltage function 494 determines the maximum motor torque control<br>
electric power constraint ('PBAT_ MAX_MT') and the minimum motor torque<br>
control electric power constraint ('PBAT_MIN_MT') based the actual battery<br>
voltage, the immediate battery power, and the set of preferred power limits.<br>
[0092] The voltage function 494 determines a change rate value feedback<br>
control when the actual battery voltage VBAT of the ESD 74 transgresses one<br>
of the upper preferred electric power limit and the lower preferred electric<br>
power limit. The change rate value is determined based on the error between<br>
the actual battery voltage VBAT of the ESD 74 and the transgressed one of the<br>
upper preferred voltage limit and the lower preferred voltage limit.<br>
[0093] The voltage function 494 adjusts only one of the maximum and<br>
minimum motor torque control electric power constraints without adjusting<br>
the other one. This affects the minimum and maximum raw output torque<br>
constraints that are output from the optimization algorithm 440, and can affect<br>
the output torque command, and the motor torque commands TA and TB for<br><br>
controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Furthermore,<br>
when the output torque is constrained, the range of the input torque can be<br>
reduced, which leads to a reduced permissible range for engine torque as<br>
determined by the tactical control scheme 330, again affecting the operating<br>
ranges of the motor torques TA, TB of the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The voltage function 494 provides a relatively fast correction of the<br>
maximum and minimum motor torque control electric power constraints to<br>
rapidly respond to modify the voltage of the ESD 74. The charge function 492<br>
provides a relatively slow correction of the maximum and minimum charge<br>
function electric power constraints in order to compensate for errors in the<br>
determination of preferred battery power POPT.<br>
[0094] When the electric power boost is enabled, with a corresponding<br>
increase in the maximum motor torque control electric power constraint ("PBAT_MAX_MT')<br>
and/or a corresponding decrease in the minimum motor torque<br>
control electric power constraint ('PBAT_MIN_MT), the output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 acts to increase motor torque commands for the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and may correspondingly<br>
decrease input torque requirements, thus either increasing torque output from<br>
the powertrain or maintaining torque output from the powertrain at a lowered<br>
power cost.<br>
[0095] The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
