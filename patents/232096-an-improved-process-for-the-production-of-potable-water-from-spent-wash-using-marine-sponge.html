				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the treatment of spent wash using marine sponge to produce potable water. More particularly it relates to separation of lignin &amp; colouring matter from spent wash through adsorption technology. Marine sponge particularly from Phyllum Porifera class Demospongia such as Mycale mytilorum, Acctenella forminifera, Presteylessa foetida, Sygmadoin carnosa &amp; Callyspongia fibrosa can be used for the treatment of spent wash.<br>
The alcohol industry in India is based on molasses as the principal raw material. The alcohol recovery ranges from 7 to 9% from the molasses, fermentable sugars, the organics, inorganic chemicals in the molasses find their way into effluent which causes high BOD/COD. This effluent known as "spent wash" is also acidic in nature, forms hydrogen sulfide, creating bad odor having black color and hence cannot be disposed as such into the water stream. In the spent wash, origin of black color is due to plant pigment melanoidins, polyphenolic compounds, caramels, which are produced by thermal degradation and condensation reaction of sugar.<br>
In the prior art following methods are used for the separation of coloring bodies from spent wash in the alcohol industries. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief here in below:<br>
This is mainly useful to minimize industrial pollution due to the spent wash. Apparatus for the decolorizing molasses.<br>
Chida, T; Tsuboi, H. Jpn. Kokai. 77, 90, 639, 30 Jul. 1977,pp.3, CA 88 :24490c.(1978)<br><br>
Molasses was decolorized with active carbon in an adsorption tower containing plate electrodes impressed with d. c. voltage. The pigments were dielec. Polarized by electrodes and adsorbed by active carbon. Thus molasses was decolorized 98% in an adsorption tower containing granular active carbon and vertical carbon electrodes at 10 cm intervals at 0.1 A/dm2 and 8V with retention time 3 h. Purification of molasses<br>
Kaga T; Hiramoto, T; Hamanaka, K; Sato, M. &amp; Tokida Y. Jpn. Kokai 77, 108, 035. 10   Sept. 1977, pp.7,. CA 88: 75566q., (1978)<br>
Granular active carbon was used to decolorize brown liquors of Brix 62 - 3 and stammer color 5.2-5.4 was passed through a regenerated active column at 75-8C and solids carbon ratio 100 with 64% decolourization and molasses having Brix 35-6 pH 5.8 &amp; stammer color 70 was passed through the same column at 72-3.<br>
Removal of coloring substances from molasses solutions.<br>
Shvets V N; Knogotkova F I; Pavyuchenko L N. Izv. Vyssh Uchebn. Zewed Pisheh. Technol. 1977, (4) 31-5, 88 : 8827n.,(1978).<br>
The filtration of molasses diluted to 35% with water through a column filled with AV -16GS. (12626-33-4) Anion exchanger in chloride form removal &gt;50% of colored substances and org. impurities. The effectiveness of removal of these substances decrease in order invert sugar &gt; melanoidins &gt; caramels. The decrease of molasses cone, improved its decolourization by exchanger. Colored substances in molasses could be coagulated by d. c. and removed by filtration but the procedure was effective only bellow 50% molasses cone.<br><br>
colored  substances in  molasses are not adsorbed  by Soviet AGS - 4 activated carbon.<br>
Sorption of sugar coloring substances on ion exchangers.<br>
Wyroba A. Zesz. Nauk. Univ-Jagiellon Pr.Chem. 19?6, 21^.355-61. CA 88:8826m.(1978)<br>
The decoloring power of ion exchange resin towards molasses (A) sugar from 3rd crystal (B) , thick syrup (C) and clear syrup (D) is not the same. Thus centranol. W -291 (I) (51258-00-5) and Amberlite IRA -900 (9050-97-9) reduce best the color of A &amp; B or Amberlite IRA -68 II (9056-59-1) can be used for decolouring C &amp; D is best decolorized by II, although Amberlite IRA-4015 (9036-93-S) can also be used. A and C can be efficiently decolorized with carboraffina activated carbon.<br>
Methods for improved determination of sugar content in dark colored products of sugar industry<br>
Zagorulko A.Ya.; Boiko E.S.; Korobeinikova L.A.; Ponomarenko A.; Burlyai T.F. Sakh Prom-St 1978 (1) 65-6. CA 88 : 91344w.(1979)<br>
Colored substances present in the intermediate of sugar manuf. and molasses can be removed by combined treatment 1st with Pb (OAC) 4 (546-67-8) and then with activated carbon. The decolorized solns. are made up to known vols, and used for the polarimetric/ polometric? detn. of sucrose (I) (57-50-1). Activated carbon does not absorb (I) (87-50-1) and it does not require washing after it is filtered off.<br><br>

Waste water treatment plant with Bioexcel and HCF systems<br>
Tsukui, R.; Ito, H.; Ebara, Z.; 1996 CA: 22467e. Wastewater treatment plant equipped  with  a  Bioexcel  system  (a biotreatment system featuring filtration by sponge filter media and a HVF<br><br>
system.   The BOD, COD and SS in the raw wastewater were 950,680 and 300 mg/L and the treated wastewater were 140, 160 and 50 mg/l. Utilization of a sponge media integrated fixed film activated sludge process for treatment of high ammonia industrial wastewater.<br>
Louis, R.; Randall, C. 1995 CA : 324364g.<br>
Process characteristics of an integrated fixed film activated sludge treatment system utilizing the sponge media LINPOR were investigated for treatment of a high strength, high ammonia N - industrial wastewater. Operating bench scale anoxic aerobic reactor of media cone. 10,20,30 and 40 performed the evaluations.<br>
In the process of the present lignin organics, sugars, inorganics separated by treating the black liquor with marine sponge and seahell powder.<br>
In hitherto known processes main drawback are the use of acidic media which involves corrosive problems, filtration problems due to colloidal particles and incomplete removal of organic as well as inorganic matter in the effluent water and colored effluent water due to organic mainly lignin and mellanoidin.<br>
There is continued interest on development of new improved processes for separation of lignin organic matters; inorganic compounds from black liquor produces in the distillery wastes of sugar factories. It is well known fact those lignin - containing effluents are not degradable and        hence        has        disposal    problems    in    the    environment<br><br>
In the present invention marine sponge is employed as a decoloring agent for the first time and no references to that effect are available in the literature. The combination of sponge and pretreated naturally occurring Calciferous material preferably oyster shell powder found to remove organics, inorganics and color of the black liquor from black to pale yellow, which further treated with active carbon to get almost colorless liquid.<br>
The treated effluent was found to be passing BOD, COD and all the other parameters of effluent treated water required by the environmental agencies.<br>
All the operations in this process are done at room temperature, hence saves energy costs, the treated water can be recycled to the process. The resins used in the process can be generated with known methods.<br>
The invention is based on our finding that in the presence of Sponge, chemical constituents like highly sulfated groups rich in N-acetylglucoseamine, N-acetylgalactoseamine, glucuronic acid along with amino sugars having better phycocolloid properties and anionic polyelectrolytes with marked cation exchange properties must be of some significance in marine fauna &amp; can be used effectively to remove pollutants form the waste.<br>
Further at pH &gt;3 sulfated groups and several fractions of neutral polysaccharides like N-acetylglucose amine, N-acetylgalactoseamine are responsible for the selective absorption of coloring chromophores and potassium with the adsorption of the lignin polyphenol^ bodies, the obtained pale yellow effluent treated with Lime power CaO &gt; 98%, ion exchange<br><br>
