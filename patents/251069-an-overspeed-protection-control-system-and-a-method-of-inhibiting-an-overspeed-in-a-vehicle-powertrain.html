				<td>POWERTRAIN OVERSPEED PROTECTION<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a powertrain having a<br>
transmission driven by an internal combustion engine through a torque converter,<br>
and more particularly to an overspeed protection control for a powertrain.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Vehicle powertrains typically include a prime mover, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine, a transmission and a coupling device that transfers<br>
drive torque from the prime mover to the transmission. The transmission<br>
multiplies the drive torque by an applied gear ratio to drive the vehicle's<br>
drivetrain. Exemplary transmissions include an automatic transmission having<br>
fixed gear ratios and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) having infinitely<br>
variable gear ratios.<br>
[0004] The coupling device often includes a torque converter that<br>
provides a fluid coupling between an output shaft of the prime mover and an<br>
input shaft of the transmission. As the output shaft accelerates, the input shaft is<br>
induced to accelerate through the fluid coupling. Once the input shaft speed is<br>
sufficiently near to the output shaft speed, a torque converter clutch (TCC) is<br>
engaged to provide a direct drive between the output shaft and the input shaft.<br>
General Motors No. GP-307904<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000404<br>
[0005] In some instances, an overspeed condition can arise, wherein<br>
an uncontrolled speed flare occurs in the powertrain. Such overspeed conditions<br>
can result in damage to engine, torque converter and/or transmission<br>
components.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
inhibiting an overspeed condition in a vehicle powertrain. The method includes<br>
monitoring at least one of a transmission input shaft speed and an engine speed<br>
and determining an operating condition of the vehicle powertrain. The method<br>
further includes determining a first threshold speed based on the operating<br>
condition and reducing an engine torque request when the at least one of the<br>
transmission input shaft speed and the engine speed exceeds the first threshold<br>
speed.<br>
[0007] In one feature, the method further includes providing a fixed<br>
torque reduction amount. The engine torque request is reduced by the fixed<br>
torque reduction amount.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the method further includes determining a<br>
torque reduction amount based on a difference between the at least one of the<br>
transmission input shaft speed and the engine speed and the first threshold<br>
speed. The engine torque request is reduced by the torque reduction amount.<br>
[0009] In another feature, the method further includes determining a<br>
second threshold speed based on the operating condition, and determining the<br>
engine torque request without a reduction when the at least one of the<br>
transmission input shaft speed and the engine speed is less than the second<br>
threshold speed.<br>
[0010] In other features, the first threshold speed is determined based<br>
on one of an attained gear speed, a commanded gear speed and a commanded<br>
speed profile. The operating condition is one of an upshift and a downshift of a<br>
gear ratio of the transmission.<br>
[0011] In still another feature, the operating condition is one of a<br>
garage shift condition and a neutral idle condition and the first threshold speed<br>
corresponds to a maximum engine speed limit.<br>
[0012] In yet another feature, the transmission is one of an automatic<br>
transmission and a continuously variable transmission.<br>
[0013] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary powertrain 10 is<br>
illustrated and includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a<br>
coupling device 16. More specifically, air is drawn into an intake manifold 18 of<br>
the engine 12 through a throttle 20. The air is mixed with fuel and the air/fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders 22 to reciprocally drive pistons (not shown)<br>
within the cylinders 22. The pistons rotatably drive a crankshaft 24 (see Figure<br>
2) to provide drive torque. Exhaust generated by the combustion process is<br>
exhausted from the engine through an exhaust manifold 26. Although 4 cylinders<br>
are illustrated, it is appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in<br>
vehicles having any number of cylinders.<br>
[0028] The drive torque drives is transferred through the torque<br>
converter 16 to drive the transmission 14. The transmission 14 multiplies the<br>
drive torque by a desired gear ratio to provide a modified drive torque. The<br>
modified drive torque is transferred to a vehicle driveline (not shown) by a<br>
transmission output shaft 28. The transmission 14 can include one of a manual<br>
transmission, an automatic transmission, an automated manual transmission and<br>
a continuously variable transmission (CVT). An automatic transmission includes<br>
a plurality of pre-defined, fixed gear ratios. A common CVT includes a belt and<br>
adjustable pulley system that enables an infinite variability between gear ratios<br>
without discrete steps or shifts.<br>
[0029] A control module 30 regulates operation of the powertrain based<br>
on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, the control module 30<br>
regulates an effective throttle area (Aeff) via a throttle actuator 32. A throttle<br>
position sensor 34 generates a throttle position signal (TPS) based on the<br>
angular position of the throttle 20. The control module 30 determines a<br>
requested engine torque (TREq) and adjusts the throttle position and other engine<br>
operating parameters to achieve TREq. The other engine operating parameters<br>
include, but are not limited to, a fueling rate, spark timing, a camshaft phase<br>
and/or an intake/exhaust valve lift or timing.<br>
[0030] The control module 30 also regulates operation of the<br>
transmission 14 based on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, a<br>
crankshaft position sensor 36 generates a crankshaft position signal, which is<br>
used to determine an actual engine speed (RPMEng)- A transmission output<br>
shaft speed (TOSS) sensor 38 generates a TOSS signal, which is used to<br>
determine a vehicle speed (Vveh), and a transmission input shaft speed (TISS)<br>
sensor 39 generates a TISS signal. The control module 30 adjusts a gear ratio<br>
of the transmission 14 based on the throttle position (i.e., TPS) and VVeh- In an<br>
automatic transmission, the gear is shifted accordingly, and in a CVT, the pulley<br>
ratio is adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Figure 2, the coupling device 16 is illustrated<br>
as a torque converter that provides a fluid coupling between the engine 12 and<br>
the transmission 14. Although the present invention will be described with<br>
respect to a torque converter, it is appreciated that the overspeed protection<br>
control of the present invention can be implemented with vehicle powertrains<br>
having alternative coupling devices including, but not limited to, a dual-clutch<br>
coupling device and a starting clutch coupling device.<br>
[0032] The torque converter 16 includes a housing 50 that is fixed for<br>
rotation with the crankshaft 24 via a flywheel 52. An impeller 54 is fixed for<br>
rotation with the housing 50 and a turbine 56 is fixed for rotation with a<br>
transmission input shaft 58. A stator 60 is also provided and is fixed from<br>
rotation. The interior of the torque converter 16 is filled with a viscous fluid.<br>
Rotation of the impeller 54 induces corresponding motion of the viscous fluid,<br>
which is directed towards the turbine 56 by the stator 60 to induce rotation of the<br>
turbine 56. The torque converter 16 includes a torque converter clutch (TCC)<br>
(not shown), which is selectively engaged to proved a direct drive between the<br>
crankshaft 24 and the input shaft 58.<br>
[0033] As the crankshaft 24 rotates at an idle speed (RPMidle), the<br>
impeller 54 is induced to rotate. RPMidle, however, is normally insufficient to<br>
overcome braking forces that inhibit the turbine 56 from rotating. As the braking<br>
forces are reduced and/or RPMeng increases, the impeller 54 drives the viscous<br>
fluid into the turbine 56 and the turbine 56 is induced to rotate. As a result, drive<br>
torque is transferred through the transmission 14 to propel the vehicle. Upon<br>
achieving a point where there is little or no RPM difference between the turbine<br>
56 and impeller 54, the TCC is engaged to provide a direct drive between the<br>
engine 12 and the transmission 14. Under this condition, the rotational speed of<br>
the turbine 56 (RPMturb) is equal to RPMeng- Generally, RPMturb is determined<br>
based on the TISS signal and is equivalent to the TISS (RPMTiss)-<br>
[0034] The overspeed protection control of the present invention<br>
protects the engine 12, torque converter 16 and/or transmission 14 from damage<br>
in an overspeed condition. An overspeed condition occurs when at least one of<br>
RPMeng and RPMturb flares and exceeds a theoretical or expected engine or<br>
turbine speed (RPMengexp, RPMturbexp)- It is anticipated that RPMnss can<br>
replace RPMturb, and, as a result, the overspeed protection control of the<br>
present invention can be implemented in vehicle powertrains that do not include<br>
a torque converter. An overspeed condition can damage the engine 12, the<br>
torque converter 16 and/or the transmission 14. The overspeed protection<br>
control determines whether at least one of RPMeng and RPMturb exceeds an<br>
upper threshold (RPMuthr) and reduces TREq to until it falls below a lower<br>
threshold (RPMlthr)-<br>
[0035] Treq can be reduced by a fixed amount. Alternatively, TREq can<br>
be reduced by an amount that is determined based on the difference between<br>
RPMturb and RPMuthr. In this manner, the overspeed condition can be more<br>
rapidly resolved thereby reducing the potential for damage to the powertrain<br>
components. By regulating TREq, a quicker, more accurate control is provided to<br>
better inhibit or resolve the overspeed condition. In this manner, a high level of<br>
powertrain protection is provided.<br>
[0036] As described in further detail below, RPMUThr and RPMlthr are<br>
determined based on a powertrain operating condition. The powertrain operating<br>
conditions include, but are not limited to, a neutral condition, an upshift condition,<br>
a downshift condition, a garage shift condition and a steady gear condition. In<br>
the case of an automatic transmission, each of these conditions can be present,<br>
wherein the overspeed protection control of the present invention includes<br>
corresponding control strategies. In the case of a CVT, the overspeed protection<br>
control for garage shift and neutral conditions can be combined under a first<br>
control strategy and the remaining conditions are combined under a second<br>
control strategy.<br>
[0037] Referring now to Figure 3, the TREq is reduced when at least<br>
one of RPMeng and RPMturb exceeds RPMuthr, during the neutral condition. In<br>
this manner, RPMENG and/or RPMturb is maintained equal to or below RPMuthr-<br>
If RPMENG and/or RPMturb falls below RPMlthr, the overspeed protection control<br>
is exited and TREq is regulated based on normal TREq control. Under the normal<br>
TrEq control, Treq is determined based on operating parameters including, but<br>
not limited to, MAP and RPMeng, and TPS.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, the overspeed protection<br>
control implements one of a first strategy (see Figure 4) and a second strategy<br>
(see Figure 5) during the upshift condition. With particular reference to Figure 4,<br>
the overspeed protection control determines RPMUThr and RPMLThr based on<br>
the engine and/or turbine RPM associated with the attained gear ratio (RPMAg)-<br>
For example, in the case of an automatic transmission, if a shift from 2nd to 3rd<br>
gear is being performed, the overspeed protection control determines RPMuthr,<br>
such that RPMeng and/or RPMturb does not exceed a corresponding 2nd gear<br>
RPM. RPMag is the desired RPM profile corresponding to the gear that the<br>
transmission shifts to as a result of the upshift (e.g., 3rd gear for the above<br>
example). With particular reference to Figure 5, the overspeed protection control<br>
determines RPMuthr and RPMlthr based on a commanded RPM profile<br>
(RPMcom).<br>
[0039] Referring now to Figures 6 and 7, the overspeed protection<br>
control can implement one of a first strategy (see Figure 6) and a second<br>
strategy (see Figure 7) during the downshift condition. With particular reference<br>
to Figure 6, the overspeed protection control determines RPMuthr and RPMlthr<br>
based on the engine and/or turbine RPM associated with the commanded gear<br>
ratio (RPMcg)- For example, in the case of an automatic transmission, if a shift<br>
from 3rd to 2nd gear is being performed, the overspeed protection control<br>
determines RPMuthr, such that RPMeng and/or RPMturb does not exceed a<br>
corresponding 2nd gear RPM. With particular reference to Figure 7, the<br>
overspeed protection control determines RPMUTHr and RPMlthr based on a<br>
RPMcom for the downshift.<br>
[0040] Referring now to Figure 8, the overspeed protection control<br>
determines RPMuthr and RPMlthr based on a maximum engine speed limit<br>
(RPMengmax) because there is no profile to follow during the garage shift / neutral<br>
idle operation. Referring now to Figure 9, the overspeed protection control<br>
determines RPMuthr and RPMlthr based on a turbine speed profile for the<br>
actual gear (RPMqear)- During a steady gear condition, the actual RPMeng<br>
and/or RPMturb should not vary from respective theoretical RPMeng and<br>
RPMturb values.<br>
[0041] Referring now to Figure 10, exemplary steps that are executed<br>
by the overspeed protection control of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail. In step 100, control determines RPMeng and/or RPMturb In step 102,<br>
control determines the powertrain condition. Control determines RPMuthr and<br>
RPMlthr based on the powertrain condition in step 104.<br>
[0042] In step 106, control determines whether at least one of RPMeng<br>
and RPMturb is greater than RPMuthr- If RPMeng and/or RPMturb is not greater<br>
then RPMuthr, control ends. If RPMeng and/or RPMturb is greater than<br>
RPMuthr, control decreases TREq in step 108. As discussed above, TREq can be<br>
reduced by a fixed amount or by an amount that is determined based on the<br>
difference between RPMeng or RPMturb and RPMuthr. In step 110, control<br>
determines whether RPMeng and/or RPMturb is less than RPMlthr- If RPMeng<br>
and/or RPMturb is not less then RPMlthr, control loops back to step 108. If<br>
RPMeng or RPMturb is less than RPMlthr, control resumes normal Treq control<br>
in step 112 and control ends.<br>
[0043] Referring now to Figure 11, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
overspeed protection control will be described in detail. The exemplary modules<br>
include, but are not limited to, a powertrain control module 200, an RPMeng<br>
and/or RPMturb determining module 202, an RPMuthr and RPMlthr determining<br>
module 204, a Treq calculating module 206 and an engine control module 208.<br>
The powertrain control module 200 regulates general operation of the powertrain<br>
components and outputs powertrain information to the RPMturb determining<br>
module 202 and the TREq calculating module. More specifically, the RPMENg<br>
and/or RPMturb determining module receives the TISS signal as an input, and<br>
both the RPMuthr and RPMlthr determining module and the Treq calculating<br>
module 206 receive the powertrain operating condition.<br>
[0044] The RPMeng and/or RPMturb determining module 202<br>
determines RPMeng and/or RPMturb- The RPMuthr and RPMlthr determining<br>
module 204 determines RPMuthr and RPMlthr based on the powertrain<br>
operating condition. The TREq calculating module 206 calculates TREq based on<br>
either the overspeed protection control of the present invention, or the normal<br>
Treq control. Under the overspeed protection control, the TREq calculating<br>
module 206 determines TREq based on RPMeng and/or RPMturb, the powertrain<br>
operating condition, RPMuthr and RPMlthr Under the normal TREq control, the<br>
TREQ calculating module 206 determines TREq based on operating parameters<br>
including, but not limited to RPMENg, MAP and TPS. The engine control module<br>
208 regulates operation of the engine 12 to achieve TREq.<br>
[0045] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
