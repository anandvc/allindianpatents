TITLE OF INVENTION <br>
"System for Separation of Gaseous Components in Pumps"<br>
(a)	MIDCO Limited having head office at<br>
(b)	Metro Estate, Vidyanagari Marg, Kalina, Mumbai 400098<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system capable of being integrated with positive displacement pump /s for separation of gaseous elements in the fluid. In particular the invention relates to a gaseous element separation system integrated in a fuel pump.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pumps are typically utilized in various applications to increase the pressure of fluid. The inlet of the pump is at lower pressure to facilitate suction of the liquid. This often results in drawing air / gaseous components with the inlet stream of the pump. Further, the fluid itself evaporates to gaseous form in the pump. This causes adverse effect on the readings / measurements of the flow measuring devices down the line of the pump that measure volumetric flow. The mixture of gaseous components and liquid obviously provide misleading measurements / readings.<br>
This problem aggravates in case of fuel pumps wherein the gaseous components mixed fuel is delivered to the vehicle. Consumers, who pay for fuel based on volumetric quantity delivered, take exception to finding they have paid for fuel and have, instead, received a sizeable quantity of air. In many jurisdictions regulatory authorities have placed strict limits on the error rate between the quantity of liquid-state fuel that is measured by the flow meter and the actual amount of fuel actually delivered.<br>
Various attempts to overcome this problem are reported in the literature, they are as follows:<br>
United States Patent 5884809 discloses air separating fuel dispensing system wherein the system includes an above-tank suction pump which draws fuel from the tank. The fuel is discharged from the suction pump into a vertically aligned air separator so as to produce a fuel stream that is substantially free of air. The fuel stream is discharged from the air separator to a flow meter and the nozzle through a fuel shutoff valve. The open/closed state of the fuel shutoff valve is controlled by<br><br><br>
a control actuator based on the differential processor across the air separator. Should this differential pressure drop below a given level, the fuel shutoff valve is closed to prevent the system from inadvertently supply a fuel stream with an unacceptably high air content. Gaseous fluid removed by the air separator is supplied to an air eliminator. The fuel components of this fluid stream are removed in the air eliminator and returned to the suction pump. However, the invention suffers from the limitation that the air separator is separate and not integrated with the pump making the assembly bulky. Further, the invention is limited to separation of air only and not any gaseous components.<br>
Patent number: WO/1998/050303 discloses air separating fuel dispensing system. The system includes an above-tank suction pump which draws fuel from the tank. The fuel is discharged from the suction pump into a vertically aligned air separator so as to produce a fuel stream that is substantially free of air. The fuel stream is discharged from the air separator to a flow meter and the nozzle through a fuel shutoff valve. The open/closed state of the fuel shutoff valve is controlled by a control actuator based on the differential pressure across the fuel shutoff valve. Should this differential pressure drop below a given level, the fuel shutoff valve is closed to prevent the system from inadvertently supplying a fuel stream with unacceptably high air content. Gaseous fluid removed by the air separator is supplied to an air eliminator. The fuel components of this fluid stream are removed in the air eliminator and returned to the suction pump.<br>
European Patent EP0357513 discloses fuel dispenser with a device for controlling. It comprises of a pump for retail delivery wherein the fuel is degassed by means of a vortex device. A control valve shuts off delivery if the gas content in the degassed liquid being delivered via a main duct is too high. Unlike prior systems which sense gas content only in the liquid being delivered, the present invention senses the greater gas content in the recycled gas-enriched fraction from the vortex separator device. This is done by means of a venturi system controlling a servo-valve which in turn controls the control valve. By using a<br><br><br>
magnified image of the gas content, the system is made more sensitive and more reliable. However this system suffers from a limitation that the air separator is not integrated with the pump and does not work in tandem with the pump. Further the use of servo valve along with venturi adds on the parts making the system complex and expensive.<br>
United States Patent 6748982 discloses Integrated fuel delivery and vapor recovery system for a fuel dispenser. The apparatus includes a fuel dispenser having a member constructed from extruded material connected to the fuel dispenser. The member has at least one fluid conduit located inside the member for transporting fluid. The member also has a vapor conduit located inside the member for transporting vapor.<br>
United States Patent 6290760 discloses air separator system An apparatus and method for separating dissolved gasses from a fluid to produce de-aerated fluid which includes a fluid pump, a gas separator, and a vacuum pump for removing liberated dissolved gasses from the gas separator. In one particular embodiment, a unified pump/meter unit is used to both pump fluid, as well as volumetrically measure the amount of de-aerated fluid pumped. However this system is installed at the inlet of the pump and is not integrated with the pump. The system is bulky.<br>
Patent Number GB967106 discloses improvements relating to liquid fuel dispensing apparatus in which two liquids are mixed in variable proportions or supplied separately by adjustment of variable gearing at connecting the outputs of two meters has one grade of liquid e.g. petrol from motor driven pump and air separator supplied to both meters, and a second liquid, e.g. oil, is pumped into the supply to one meter in a predetermined fixed proportion to the petrol supplied thereto. The fixed proportion of oil is produced by a meter driven by gearing from the output of meter.<br>
United States Patent 6290760 discloses air separator system for separating dissolved gasses from a fluid to produce de-aerated fluid which includes a fluid pump, a gas separator, and a vacuum pump for removing liberated dissolved gasses   from   the   gas   separator.   In   one   particular  embodiment,   a   unified<br><br><br>
pump/meter unit is used to both pump fluid, as well as volumetrically measure the amount of de-aerated fluid pumped.<br>
European Patent EP1189832 discloses system and method for deaerating and dispensing liquid fuel. As disclosed in publication number WO0076910 it discloses a system for monitoring the quantity of air in a liquid-state fuel stream discharged from a dispenser. The dispenser includes a pump that draws the fuel from a storage tank. The fuel stream discharged from the pump is applied to an air separator in which the air and vapor-state fluids are removed from the fuel stream. The gas-removed fuel stream is allowed to flow to nozzle for dispensing. The gas stream created by the air separator is flowed to an air elimination chamber. The fuel in the gas stream separates from the air in the air elimination chamber and is returned to an input side of the pump. The air in the air elimination chamber is vented through a fixed opening to the ambient environment. The monitoring system includes a transducer that monitors the rate of air flow through the air elimination chamber. This monitoring may be performed by monitoring the air pressure in the chamber upstream of an orifice through which the air is vented to atmosphere. If the air flow rate is greater than a set level, the system closes a valve that regulates fuel flow to the nozzle. Thus, this system prevents fuel that contains an excessive quantity of gaseous-state fluids from being dispensed.<br>
Patent number KR20020070753 discloses pump unit integrated with flow meter wherein a pump and the flow meter are incorporated in a casing wherein a channel which connects the pump and the flow meter is formed on the casing. An air separator and a strainer on the discharging side are provided on the channel.<br>
The system is such wherein air and fuel mixture in form of the froth are directed into external chamber. Over a period of time the froth would coalesce and separate into a layer of fuel and air above it. There is a mechanism of float to control the opening and closing of the valve to direct the fuel back to the suction port of the pump. However this mechanism is bulky and consumes considerable time before the fuel and air actually are separated. Further, if the quantity of gaseous elements is substantial in the system, there is a danger of over flow of<br><br><br>
fuel from the air vent. Thus this gaseous components separation system mainly relies on the stabilization of froth so as to form gaseous components and coalescence of froth to form fluid. This method is time consuming and ineffective.<br>
Thus the study of the related prior art reveals several technological gaps such as lack of integrated gaseous element separation systems with pumps, bulky systems, lack of dynamic separation of the gaseous elements from the fluid.<br>
Necessity has constantly been felt to develop a system that can be integrated with pump for separation of gaseous elements in the fluid dynamically obviating bulky mechanism yet effectively using kinetic energy of the pumped fluid and functioning in tandem with the pump.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a system capable of being integrated with pump/s for separation of gaseous elements in a fluid.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide gaseous element separation system integrated in a fuel pump.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a fuel pump integrated with gaseous element separation system.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to obviate the need to stabilize froth prior to separation of the fluids namely gas and fluid.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a compact system for separation of gaseous component from a fluid.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to separate gaseous component using pumped fluid kinetic energy thereby obviating the need to supply external energy for the process of separation.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide gaseous component separation system that functions in conjunction with the pump.<br>
Another object of the invention is to dynamically separate gaseous components.<br>
Thus in accordance with this invention, the system comprises of:<br>
inlet provision for the fluid adapted to receive pumped fluid from the pumping<br>
chamber of the pump; a contoured surfaced passage preferably in the form of<br>
partial spiral adapted and dimensioned to fit to the said inlet provision;   a conduit<br>
coaxially disposed in connection with the said contoured surface;   fluid outlet and<br>
accumulation provision;<br>
wherein<br>
pumped fluid from the said fluid inlet provision enters the said contoured surface<br>
passage wherein angular velocity of the fluid and hence centrifugal force is<br>
substantially increased resulting in rotation of every single particle of fluid about its<br>
own axis to generate vortex motion because of the said contour, resulting in<br>
separation of the gaseous element wherein the gaseous element separated fluid<br>
is accumulated in the said accumulation provision.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Features and advantages of this invention will become apparent in the following detailed  description  and  the  preferred  embodiments with   reference  to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1       Schematic of the system (Sheet 1)<br>
Figure 2       Schematic of the system integrated with fuel pump (Sheet 2)<br>
Figure 3       Schematic of the system integrated with fuel pump (Sheet 3)<br>
Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of the system layout. The system primarily comprises of an inlet provision 1 for the fluid adapted to receive pumped fluid from the pumping chamber of the pump indicated by arrow 2. The fluid passes from the said inlet provision 1 to the contoured surfaced passage 3. The said passage is   preferably   defined   by   substantially   spiral   surface   that   is   adapted   and<br><br><br>
dimensioned to fit the said inlet provision. In one of the embodiments the said surface is a half spiral. One of the ends of the conduit 4 with circular cross section is adapted to fit the said passage 3 wherein the said conduit 4 is co-axially aligned with the said passage 3. The other end of the said conduit 4 is adapted to fit the fluid outlet and accumulation provision 5. The gaseous element venting provision 6 is provided on the said accumulation provision 5.<br>
The direction of the fluid flow is indicated as a representation by arrows (7). The pumped fluid from the said fluid inlet provision enters the said contoured surface passage wherein angular velocity of the fluid and hence centrifugal force is substantially increased resulting in rotation of every single particle of fluid about its own axis to generate vortex motion. The fluid enters the said conduit 4 in spiral as indicated by arrow 7 resulting in separation of gaseous elements because the centrifugal force causes heavier particles (fluid) move to the periphery of the pipe and the gaseous components move to the centre resulting in separation of the gaseous element. The gaseous element separated fluid (direction shown by arrow 7) is accumulated in the said accumulation 5 provision and the separated gaseous elements are let out of the said provision 6. The velocity of the fluid, pumping pressure, angular velocity, density of fluid, viscosity, the diameter and length of the conduit 4 govern the centrifugal force magnitude and separation of the gaseous components.<br>
Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrates integration of the gaseous separation system in the fuel pump. The system is adapted in the pump 10. The inlet provision is indicated as 1 that opens in the contoured surfaced passage 3. The venting provision and accumulation provision is not shown.<br>
In one of the embodiments the operating parameters are selected as linear velocity 600 mm/sec, the angular velocity in the range of 31.6 rad/sec - 42.85 rad/sec, pumping pressure in the range of 1.8 kg/cm2 - 3.5 kg/cm2 , Diameter range of the vortex in the range of 14mm - 19mm, length of the vortex pipe 130.5 mm, ratio of length to diameter of the pipe as 261:64 wherein fluid is selected with density in the range of 0.8 gm/cc -- 1 gm/cc (water) inclusive of petrol and diesel, viscosity of the fluids in the range of 0.55 centistokes ( water) - 40 centistokes<br><br><br>
(engine oil) inclusive of petrol ( 0.4 - 0.8 centistokes) and diesel ( 1.0 - 29.8 centistokes).<br>
In another embodiment the fluid is diesel.<br>
In yet another embodiment the fluid is petrol.<br>
Thus it is evident that the judicious combination of the contoured surfaced passage, conduit, fluid inlet provision and integration of the same in the pump results in separation of the gaseous elements dynamically obviating bulky mechanism yet effectively using kinetic energy of the pumped fluid and functioning in tandem with the pump.<br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
