				<td>HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE CRYSTALS AND<br>
METHODS FOR PREPARING THEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to crystals of human<br>
growth hormone or a human growth hormone derivative and<br>
compositions or formulations comprising them. In addition, the<br>
invention provides methods for producing crystals of human<br>
growth hormone or a human growth hormone derivative. The<br>
crystals of the present invention are particularly useful in<br>
methods for treating a mammal having disorders associated with<br>
human growth hormone deficiency or which are ameliorated by<br>
treatment with human growth hormone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Somatotropin or growth hormone ("GH") is a mammalian<br>
protein comprising a class of tropic hormones synthesized and<br>
secreted in the brain by the major gland of the endocrine<br>
system, the adenohypophysis. The secretion of GH and other<br>
tropic hormones by the adenohypophysis regulates the activity of<br>
cells in other endocrine glands and tissues throughout the body.<br><br>
Specifically, GH is secreted by somatotrophs of the anterior<br>
pituitary gland and functions to stimulate the liver and other<br>
tissues to synthesize and secrete IGF-1, a protein that controls<br>
cell division, regulates metabolic pxocesses and exists in a<br>
free state or binds to one of six other proteins designated as<br>
IGFBP-1 through 6. The secretion process itself is modulated by<br>
opposing actions of somatoliberin (promoting GH release) and<br>
somatostatin (inhibiting GH release).<br>
[0003] Human growth hormone ("hGH") is of particular interest<br>
because it serves as a critical hormone in the regulation of<br>
cell and organ growth and in physiological function upon various<br>
stages of aging. For example, overproduction of hGH results in<br>
gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults, whereas under-<br>
production leads to dwarfism in children [Mauras et al. , J.<br>
Clin. Endocrinology and Metabolism, 85(10), 3653-3660 (2000);<br>
Frindik et al., Hormone Research, 51(1), 15-19 (1999); Leger<br>
et al. , J. Clin. Endocrinology and Metabolism, 83(10), 3512-3516<br>
(1998)], Turner's Syndrome (females only) [Bramswig, Endocrine,<br>
15(1), 5-13 (2001); Pasquino et al. , Hormone Research, 46(6),<br>
269-272 (1996)] and chronic renal insufficiency [Carroll et al.,<br>
Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, 11(6), 231-238 (2000);<br>
Ueland et al. , J. Clin. Endocrinology and Metabolism, 87(6),<br>
2760-2763 (2002); Simpson et al. , Growth Hormone &amp; IGF Research,<br>
12, 1-33 (2002)]. In adults, hGH deficiency can affect<br>
metabolic processing of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids,<br>
minerals and connective tissue and can result in muscle, bone or<br>
skin atrophy [Mehls and Haas, Growth Hormone &amp; IGF Research,<br>
Supplement B, S31-S37 (2000); Fine et al. , J". Pediatrics,<br>
136(3), 376-382 (2000); Motoyama et al., Clin. Exp. Nephrology,<br>
2(2), 162-165 (1998)]. Other hGH deficiency disorders<br>
characterized by growth failure include AIDS wasting syndrome<br>
[Hirschfeld, Hormone Research, 46, 215-221 (1996); Tritos<br>
et al., Am. J. Medicine, 105(1), 44-57 (1998); Mulligan et al.<br><br>
J. Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 23(6), S202-S209 (1999);<br>
Torres and Cadman, BioDrugs, 14(2), 83-91 (2000)] and Prader-<br>
Willi syndrome [Ritzen, Hormone Research, 56(5-6), 208 (2002);<br>
Eiholzer et al., Eur. J. Pediatrics, 157(5), 368-377 (1998)].<br>
[0004] To date, treatment regimens for hGH deficiency in<br>
humans focus primarily on subcutaneous injection of purified hGH<br>
made by recombinant DNA technology. That therapeutic is<br>
packaged as either a solution in a cartridge or a lyophilized<br>
powder requiring reconstitution at the time of use. The<br>
frequency of injection varies depending on the disease being<br>
treated and the commercially available product being used. For<br>
example, dwarfism is treated by daily subcutaneous injection of<br>
recombinant hGH.<br>
[0005] The use of subcutaneous administration as a rapid<br>
delivery route for hGH is necessitated by the inherent<br>
instability of the protein in solution. That instability<br>
results from cleavage of critical intramolecular crosslinks at<br>
specific positions within the amino acid sequence of the<br>
protein, which in turn disrupts the essential three-dimensional<br>
structure recognized by and associated with cellular surfaces in<br>
the patient. The mechanism for hGH cleavage or degradation is<br>
orchestrated primarily by oxidation of methionine residues or<br>
deamidation of aspartic acid residues upon dissolution, thereby<br>
rendering the protein inactive. Due to this fragility, a need<br>
in the art exists for hGH compositions or formulations that are<br>
stable and long-acting and can be delivered not only<br>
subcutaneously but by other conventional dosage routes, such as<br>
oral, dermal and intravenous routes.<br>
[0006] A number of commercially available hGH products have<br>
been developed in an attempt to address this need. For example,<br>
Nutropin DepotÂ® is an injectable suspension of recombinant human<br>
growth hormone (rhGH) embedded in a polylactide-coglycolide<br>
(PLG) microspheres (see http://www.gene.com). In addition to<br><br>
rhGH and PLG, the microspheres also comprise zinc acetate and<br>
zinc carbonate components. Prior to administration, the solid<br>
material must be reconstituted with an aqueous solution<br>
comprising carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt, polysorbate,<br>
sodium chloride and water. This suspension, which is mostly-<br>
comprised of polymer, is administered once or twice monthly and<br>
requires a 21 gauge needle for injection. Due to the size of<br>
the microspheres and the viscous nature of the product, adverse<br>
injection-site reactions can occur, resulting in nodules,<br>
erythema, pain, bruising, itching, lipoatrophy and puffiness<br>
(see http://www.genentech.com/gene/products/information/<br>
opportunistic/nutropin-depot/index. jsp) .<br>
[0007] Another hGH product in development but subsequently<br>
discontinued is Albutropinâ¢, a long acting genetically produced<br>
fusion protein of human albumin and human growth hormone (see<br>
http://www.hgsi.com/products/ albutropin.html). This product is<br>
said to exhibit prolonged half-life in circulation, roughly a<br>
fifty percent increase over that of soluble native hGH.<br>
Albutropinâ¢ is typically delivered by injection on a weekly<br>
basis and is said to stimulate IGF-1 levels long after clearance<br>
from the body. The biological effect of this product is similar<br>
to that of currently available growth hormone therapies.<br>
[0008] Another product developed was Infitropin CRâ¢, a<br>
formulation of hGH comprised of polyethylene glycol-conjugated<br>
hGH molecules. This conjugated hGH required a once a week<br>
injection and was said to be released at a continuous rate,<br>
without significant burst effect [Ross et al., J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
271(36), 21696-21977 (1996)]. However, this product was<br>
discontinued.<br>
[0009] United States patents 5,981,485 and 6,448,225 refer to<br>
aqueous formulations of hGH that are said not to require a<br>
reconstitution step and are administered by daily injection.<br>
Such formulations typically contain hGH, a buffer, a non-ionic<br><br>
surfactant and optionally,, a neutral salt, mannitol, or a<br>
preservative.<br>
[0010] Various other drug delivery technologies, such as<br>
hydrogels [Katakam et al., J. Controlled Release, 49(1), 21-26<br>
(1997)], liposomes, oil emulsions and biodegradable polymer<br>
microspheres, have been used in attempts to provide sustained<br>
drug release of hGH. However, the resulting formulations<br>
display a burst release of the drug, use harsh conditions and<br>
some are complicated to manufacture. This is especially true of<br>
hGH formulations based on DL-lactic co-glycolic acid (PLGA)<br>
microsphere technology, because the process used to produce the<br>
microspheres tends to employ conditions such as elevated<br>
temperatures, surfactant, organic solvents and aqueous/organic<br>
solvent interface, all of which cause protein denaturation<br>
[Herberger et al., Proc. Intl. Symp. Controlled Release of<br>
Bioactive Materials, 23, 835-836 (1996); Kim et al., Jntl. J.<br>
Pharmaceutics, 229(1-2), 107-116 (2001)].<br>
[0011] Some of the above-described preparations require hGH<br>
to be stored in a lyophilized state, which can be a time<br>
consuming and expensive process. United States patents<br>
5,780,599 and 6,117,984 refer to divalent cation crystals of hGH<br>
and methods of producing divalent cation crystals of hGH,<br>
without the need for a lyophilization step.<br>
[0012] Despite the efforts to address drawbacks of<br>
conventional hGH products, including instability upon storage<br>
and injection, short in vivo half-life, burst effects, lack of<br>
oral bioavailability, and difficulty and frequency of<br>
administration, the need for improved hGH preparations remains.<br>
To address this need, the present invention advantageously<br>
provides crystals of human growth hormone that yield stable,<br>
long-acting hGH.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The present invention is directed to stable, long-<br>
acting, convenient and patient-friendly crystals of human growth<br>
hormone or a human growth hormone derivative. The invention<br>
further provides compositions of crystals of human growth<br>
hormone or a human growth hormone derivative, including<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof. The invention<br>
further provides methods for preparing such crystals, as well as<br>
compositions comprising them. The crystals and compositions of<br>
this invention are advantageously used in methods for treating<br>
an individual having a disorder associated with human growth<br>
hormone deficiency or which is ameliorated by treatment by<br>
treatment with human growth hormone.<br>
[0014] Crystals of human growth hormone or a human growth<br>
hormone derivative, or compositions or formulations comprising<br>
them, have several advantages, including: the capability of once<br>
per week dosing, ready to use crystalline suspension form,<br>
safety, efficacy, purity, stability, resuspendability and<br>
syringeability over a short period of time. Other objects of<br>
the invention, including improvements of hGH crystals and<br>
compositions or formulations comprising them, as compared with<br>
conventional hGH preparations, will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art, in view of the disclosure herein.<br>

includes the 191 amino acid sequence of native hGH,<br>
somatotropin, and the 192 amino acid sequence containing an N-<br>
terminal methionine (Met-hGH) and somatrem [United States<br>
patents 4,342,832 and 5,633,352]. hGH may be obtained by<br>
i isolation and purification from a biological source or by<br>
recombinant DNA methods, flf made by recombinant DNA<br>
methodology, hGH is denoted as recombinant human growth hormone<br>
(rhGH). Met-hGH is typically prepared by recombinant DNA<br>
methodology.<br>
[0046] The term "human growth hormone derivative" refers to a<br>
protein having an amino acid sequence that is comparable to that<br>
of naturally occurring human growth hormone. The term<br>
"comparable" refers to an amino acid sequence that is between 2%<br>
and 100% homologous to the 191 amino acid sequence of hGH or the<br>
192 amino acid sequence of Met-hGH. In various embodiments of<br>
the present invention, human growth hormone derivatives comprise<br>
organic cations of hGH or Met-hGH, substitution, deletion and<br>
insertion variants of biologically synthesized hGH or Met-hGH<br><br>
proteins, post-translationally modified hGH and Met-hGH<br>
proteins, including deamidation, phosphorylation,<br>
glycoslylation, acetylation, aggregation and enzymatic cleavage<br>
reactions [Haro et al., J. Chromatography B, 720, 39-47 (1998)],<br>
chemically modified hGH or Met-hGH proteins derived from<br>
biological sources, polypeptide analogs and chemically<br>
synthesized peptides containing amino acid sequences analogous<br>
to those of hGH or Met-hGH.<br>
[0047] Methods used to prepare hGH or Met-hGH include<br>
isolation from a biological source, recombinant DNA methodology,-<br>
synthetic chemical routes or combinations thereof. To date,<br>
genes that encode for different DNA sequences of hGH include<br>
hGH-N and hGH-V [Haro et al. , J. Chromatography B, 720, 39-47<br>
(1998); Bennani-Baiti et al., Genomics, 29, 647-652 (1995)].<br>
[0048] The term "valency" is defined as an element's ability<br>
to combine with other elements and which is dictated by the<br>
number of electrons in the outermost shell of the atom and<br>
expressed as the number of atoms of hydrogen (or any other<br>
standard univalent element) capable of uniting with (or<br>
replacing) its atoms [Webster's New World Dictionary of Science,<br>
Lindley, D. and Moore T.H., Eds., Macmillan, New York, New York,<br>
1998] . The terms "monovalent cation" and "divalent cation"<br>
refer to ions carrying a positive charge that have either a<br>
valence state of one or two, respectively. Cations having<br>
different valence states can be organic or inorganic in nature.<br>
Examples of monovalent inorganic cations include ammonium (NH4+)<br>
and Group I elements of the periodic table (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+,<br>
Cs+, and Fr+) and divalent inorganic cations include Group II<br>
elements (Be2+, Mg2+, Ca3+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2\ Zn2+,<br>
Cd2+, Mo2+ and Ra2+) .<br>
[0049] "Calcium crystal of human growth hormone or a human<br>
growth hormone derivative" refers to human growth hormone, or a<br>
derivative thereof, that has been crystallized in the presence<br><br>
of a divalent calcium ion. The divalent calcium ion is<br>
introduced into the crystallization solution as a calcium salt.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a calcium crystal of human growth<br>

[0051] "Organic cation crystal of human growth hormone or a<br>
human growth hormone derivative" refers to human growth hormone<br>
that has been crystallized in the presence of an organic cation.<br>
The term "organic cation" refers to a positively charged atom or<br>
group of atoms that contain carbon. Examples of organic cations<br>

[0052] hGH is commercially available in lyophilized form and<br>
is typically produced by recombinant DNA methods. According to<br>
this invention, crystallization of hGH is generally accomplished<br>
by preparing a buffered solution of hGH, purifying and/or<br>
desalting, dialyzing and concentrating the solution and adding a<br>
monovalent or divalent cation or salt to the solution. The<br>
latter step results in the formation of an organic or inorganic<br>
cation bound to hGH.<br>
[0053] One preferred embodiment of this invention relates to<br>
monovalent cation crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment, the monovalent cation is selected<br>
from the group consisting of: lithium, sodium, potassium and<br>
ammonium. In a most preferred embodiment, the monovalent cation<br>
is sodium. In a most preferred embodiment, human growth hormone<br>
or a human growth hormone derivative comprises from about 1 to<br>
about 500 monovalent cation molecules per monomer or monomer<br>
chain of human growth hormone or human growth hormone<br>
derivative.<br>
[0054] The term "monovalent cation salt" includes both<br>
inorganic and organic counterions or molecules that from an<br>
ionic bond with the monovalent ion. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the monovalent cation salt is a sodium salt. In a more<br>
preferred embodiment, the sodium salt is selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of sodium citrate, sodium phosphate and sodium<br>
acetate. In a most preferred embodiment, the sodium salt is<br>
sodium acetate.<br>
[0055] Another preferred embodiment of this invention relates<br>
to a protamine crystal of hGH or an hGH derivative. Likewise,<br>
in yet another preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a<br>
polyarginine crystal of hGH or an hGH derivative.<br>
10056] A further preferred embodiment of this invention<br>
includes monovalent or divalent crystals of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative complexed or co-crystallized with protamine or<br>
polyarginine. More preferably, the crystals are sodium crystals<br>
complexed or co-crystallized with protamine or polyarginine.<br>
[0057] The soluble form of hGH may be characterized by a<br>
variety of methods, including reversed phase high performance<br>
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), size exclusion chromatography<br>
high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) and<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) [Wu et al., J.<br>
Chromatography, 500, 595-606 (1990); "Hormone Drugs", FDA<br>
publication, (1982)]. On the other hand, the crystalline form<br>
of hGH may be characterized by optical microscopy and X-ray<br>
diffraction. In general, the conditions of crystallization will<br>
determine the shape of a protein crystal, i.e., a shape selected<br>
from the group consisting of spheres, needles, rods,plates<br>
(hexagonals and squares), rhomboids, cubes, bipyramids and<br>
prisms.<br>
[0058] Crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative according to this<br>
invention form rod-like or needle-like morphologies when imaged<br>
with optical microscopy. In one embodiment, crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative form rods or needles that are between about<br>
0.1 and about 200 Âµm in length. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative form rods or needles that<br>
are between about 3 and about 100 Âµm in length. In a more<br>
preferred embodiment, crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative form<br><br>
rods or needles that are between about 10 and about 25 Âµm in<br>
length.<br>
[0059] Another embodiment of this invention relates to<br>

[0062] Crystals of human growth hormone or a human growth<br>
hormone derivative according to this invention can also be<br>
combined with a carrier or excipient, a substance that, when<br>
added to a therapeutic, speeds or improves its action [The On-<br>
Line Medical Dictionary, http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/omd/<br>

[0063] In yet a more preferred embodiment, the excipient is<br>
protamine. Furthermore, crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative<br>
and protamine are present in an hGH:protamine ratio of about 5:1<br>
to about 1:10 (w/w) . That ratio may also range between about<br>
10:1 to about 20:1 (w/w). Most preferably, that ratio ranges<br>
between about 12:1 to about 15:1 (w/w). According to an<br>
alternate embodiment, that ratio is between about 3:1 and about<br>
1:10 (w/w). In another embodiment, that ratio is between about<br>
5:1 and about 40:1 (w/w). And, in a further embodiment, that<br>
ratio is about 5:1 (w/w).<br>
[0064] In another aspect of the invention, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is selected from the group<br>
consisting of polyamino acids, including polylysine,<br>
polyarginine and polyglutamate. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
this invention, the excipient is polylysine. In a more.<br><br>
preferred embodiment, polylysine has a molecular weight between<br>
about 1,500 and about 8,000 kD. In another embodiment, the<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative and polylysine are present<br>
in an hGH:polylysine ratio of about 5:1 to about 40:1 (w/w).<br>
That ratio may also range between about 10:1 to about 20:1<br>
(w/w). Most preferably, that ratio ranges between about 12:1 to<br>
about 15:1 (w/w). According to an alternate embodiment, that<br>
ratio is about 5:1 to about 1:50 (w/w). And, in a further<br>
embodiment, that ratio is about 5:1 (w/w).<br>
[0065] In yet another preferred embodiment of this invention,,<br>
the excipient is polyarginine. In a more preferred embodiment,<br>
polyarginine has a molecular weight between about 15,000 and<br>
about 60,000 kD. In another embodiment, the crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative and polyarginine are present in an<br>
hGH:polyarginine ratio of about 5:1 to about 40:1 (w/w). That<br>
ratio may also range between about 10:1 to about 20:1 (w/w).<br>
Most preferably, that ratio ranges between about 12:1 to about<br>
3:1 (w/w). According to an alternate embodiment, that ratio is<br>
about 5:1 to about 1:50 (w/w). In another embodiment, that<br>
ratio is between about 12:1 and about 15:1 (w/w). And, in a<br>
further embodiment, that ratio is about 5:1 (w/w).<br>
[0066] One embodiment according to the present invention<br>
includes an injectable crystalline suspension comprising about<br>
20 mg/ml of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative. That<br>
suspension is characterized by easy resuspendability, slow<br>
sedimentation and a time action profile of about 7 days. It may<br>
be injected once weekly, using a 30 gauge syringe and providing<br>
an 80% level of effective loading. That suspension is pure, as<br>
reflected by parameters of 0.02% aggregation (SE-HPLC) and 2.3%<br>
related proteins (RP-HPLC). This purity is maintained for at<br>
least about 4 months under refrigerated conditions.<br>
[0067] One embodiment of this invention relates to a crystal<br>
of hGH or an hGH derivative which is characterized as having<br><br>
delayed dissolution behavior when introduced into an individual,<br>
as compared to that of conventional soluble hGH or hGH<br>
formulations. According to this invention, dissolution of<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative is characterized by either<br>
in vitro or in vivo dissolution parameters. For example, in<br>
vitro dissolution is described as the concentration of soluble<br>
hGH (expressed as a percentage of total or mg of total hGH or<br>
hGH derivative crystals originally present) obtained per 15<br>
minutes or per wash step in a sequential dissolution process<br>
(see Example 5). In one embodiment of this invention, crystals<br>
of hGH or an hGH derivative are characterized by an in vitro<br>
dissolution rate of between about 2 and about 16% of said<br>
crystal per wash step upon exposure to a dissolution buffer (50<br>
mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl and 0.02% (v/v) NaN3)<br>
at a temperature of 37Â°C, wherein the concentration of hGH or an<br>
hGH derivative is present in solution at a concentration of<br>
about 2 mg/ml. In another embodiment, crystals of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative are characterized by an in vitro dissolution rate of<br>
between about 0.04 to about 0.32 mg of said crystal per wash<br>
step in a sequential dissolution process (see Example 5). On<br>
the other hand, in vivo dissolution is described by serum levels<br>
of hGH in a mammal over time after a single injection of hGH<br>
into the mammal.<br>
[0068] In mammals, GH stimulates tissues to synthesize and<br>
secrete IGF-1, a protein that, in turn, plays a role in cell<br>
division and metabolic processes. As will be appreciated by<br>
those of skill in the art, serum hGH and IGF-1 levels are<br>
dependent on many factors, including physiological and<br>
treatment-related factors. Such factors include, but are not<br>
limited to: physiological factors, such as: birth age and bone<br>
age, sex, body weight, developmental stage (e.g., increased<br>
level at puberty) and treatment-related factors, such as dose,<br>
rate (kinetics) of dosing and route of administration. Also,<br><br>
those of skill in the art will appreciate that different hGH and<br>
IGF-1 levels may be beneficial, both from the standpoint of<br>
safety and efficacy, for different patient populations.<br>
[0069] Adults or children suffering from a variety of hGH<br>
insufficiencies, disease states or syndromes may be treated by<br>
various regimens of exogenously delivered hGH using hGH crystals<br>
or hGH derivative crystals according to this invention. For<br>
example, an endocrinologist may initiate therapy using a dose of<br>
about 0.2 mg/kg/week for a child, increasing the dose to about<br>
0.3 mg/kg/week after several weeks or months of treatment, with<br>
the dose being further increased to about 0.7 mg/kg/week around<br>
puberty. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art,<br>
the level of such exogenously delivered hGH dosed to adults or<br>
children requiring hGH delivery is also dependent upon the<br>
existing physiological level or concentrations of hGH.<br>
[0070] Dosage regimens for hGH in adults or children are<br>
often expressed in terms of mg/kg or International Units<br>
(IU/kg). Such regimens are generally scheduled for either a day<br>
or a week, i.e., mg/kg/day or mg/kg/week. With such<br>
considerations in mind, according to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, a single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative, or a composition comprising such crystals, for<br>
example, a single weekly administration of about 9 mg per 30 kg<br>
child, provides an in vivo hGH serum concentration of greater<br>
than about 10 ng/ml on days 1 and 2 post-administration, greater<br>
than about 5 ng/ml on days 3 and 4 post-administration and about<br>
0.3 ng/ml on day 5 to day 7 post-administration. Alternatively,<br>
a single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative,<br>
or a composition comprising such crystals, provides an in vivo<br>
hGH serum concentration of about 0.3 ng/ml to about 2,500 ng/ml<br>
hGH, preferably about 0.5 ng/ml to about 1,000 ng/ml hGH, most<br>
preferably about 1 ng/ml to about 100 ng/ml hGH for between<br>
about 0.5 hours and about 40 days post-administration in said<br><br>
mammal, preferably for between about 0.5 hours and any one of<br>
about 10 days, 7 days or 1 day post-administration. Similarly,<br>
a single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative,<br>
or a composition comprising such crystals., provides an in vivo<br>
serum concentration of above about 2 ng/ml hGH, preferably above<br>
about 5 ng/ml hGH, most preferably above about 10 ng/ml hGH for<br>
between about 0.5 hours to about 40 days post-administration in<br>
said mammal, preferably for any one of about 10, 7 or 1 days<br>
post-administration. In a more preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention, a single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH-<br>
derivative, or a composition comprising such crystals, provides<br>
an in vivo serum concentration of greater than about 0.3 ng/ml<br>
hGH for between about 0.5 hours and about 4 0 days in a mammal,<br>
preferably for any one period of any one of about 10, 7 or 1<br>
days post-administration. According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, a single weekly administration of crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative, or a composition comprising such crystals,<br>
provides an in vivo hGH serum concentration of greater than<br>
about 10 ng/ml hGH on days 1 and 2 post-administration, greater<br>
than about 5 ng/ml hGH on days 3 and 4 post-administration and<br>
above about 0.3 ng/ml hGH on day 5 to day 7 post-administration.<br>
And, in a further embodiment, a single administration of<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative, or a composition<br>
comprising such crystals, provides an in vivo serum<br>
concentration of greater than about 0.3 ng/ml hGH for between<br>
about 0.5 hours and about 10 days post-administration.<br>
[0071] According to one embodiment of this invention, a<br>
single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative,<br>
or a composition comprising such crystals, provides an in vivo<br>
IGF-1 serum elevation over baseline IGF-1 level prior to said<br>
administration of greater than 50 ng/ml from about 10 hours to<br>
about 72 hours post-administration and between about 0.5 ng/ml<br>
to about 50 ng/ml from about 72 hours to about 15 days post-<br><br>
administration, preferably about 10 days post-administration.<br>
Alternatively, a single administration of crystals of hGH or an<br>
hGH derivative, or a composition comprising such crystals,<br>
provides an in vivo IGF-1 serum elevation of about 5 ng/ml to<br>
about 2,500 ng/ml, preferably about 100 ng/ml to about 1,000<br>
ng/ml, for about 0.5 hours to about 4 0 days post-administration,<br>
preferably about 7 days post-administration. Alternatively, a<br>
single administration of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative,<br>
or a composition comprising such crystals, according to the<br>
present invention may provide an in vivo IGF-1 serum elevation -<br>
of above about 50 ng/ml, preferably above about 100 ng/ml, for<br>
about 0.5 hours to about 40 days post-administration, preferably<br>
about 7 days post-administration. According to one embodiment<br>
of this invention, a single administration of crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative, or a composition comprising such crystals,<br>
provides an in vivo IGF-1 serum elevation over baseline IGF-1<br>
level prior to said administration of greater than about 50<br>
ng/ml from about 10 hours to about 72 hours post-administration<br>
and between about 0.5 ng/ml to about 50 ng/ml from about<br>
72 hours to about 15 days post-administration or 72 hours to<br>
about 10 days post-administration.<br>
[0072] According to this invention, a single administration<br>
is defined as between about 0.01 mg/kg/week to about 100<br>
mg/kg/week hGH crystals or hGH derivative crystals, or a<br>
composition comprising such crystals, wherein the volume of the<br>
administration is between 0.1 ml and about 1.5 ml. For example,<br>
pediatric growth'hormone deficiency may be dosed with hGH<br>
crystals or hGH derivative crystals, or a composition comprising<br>
such crystals, at about 0.3 mg/kg/week, e.g., about 9 mg for a<br>
3 0 kg child. Turner syndrome may be dosed with hGH crystals or<br>
hGH derivative crystals, or a composition comprising such<br>
crystals, at about 0.375 mg/kg/week, e.g., about 11.25 mg for a<br>
30 kg child. Additionally, adult growth hormone deficiency may<br><br>
be dosed with hGH at about 0.2 mg/kg/week, e.g., about 16 mg for<br>
a 80 kg adult. AIDS wasting disease may be dosed with hGH at 6<br>
rag/day, e.g., 42 mg/week.<br>
[0073] In yet another embodiment of this invention, crystals<br>
of hGH or an hGH derivative, or composition comprising such<br>
crystals, display a relative bioavailability similar to that of<br>
soluble hGH in a mammal. The crystals according to this<br>
invention have a relative bioavailability of at least 50% or<br>
greater compared to that of soluble hGH, delivered by the same<br>
route (e.g., subcutaneous or intramuscular injection), wherein<br>
said bioavailability is measured by the area under curve (AUC)<br>
of total in vivo hGH serum concentration for said soluble hGH<br>
and said crystal. Crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative are thus<br>
characterized by an advantageous in vivo dissolution rate.<br>
[0074] The present invention further provides methods of<br>
administering crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative to a mammal<br>
having a disorder associated with human growth hormone<br>
deficiency or which is ameliorated by treatment with hGH. The<br>
method comprises the step of administering to the mammal a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a crystal of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative. Alternatively, the method comprises the step of<br>
administering to the mammal an effective amount of a composition<br>
comprising crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative alone or with an<br>
excipient. Various embodiments of crystals of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative according to this invention are: calcium crystals,<br>
monovalent crystals, protamine crystals or polyarginine crystals<br>
of hGH or an hGH derivative. Such crystals, or compositions<br>
comprising them, may be administered by a time regimen of about<br>
once every three days, about once a week, about once every two<br>
weeks or about once every month.<br>
[0075] Disorders related to hGH insufficiency that may be<br>
treated according to this invention include, but are not limited<br>
to: adult growth hormone deficiency, pediatric growth hormone<br><br>
deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, short bowel<br>
syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, idiopathic short stature,<br>
dwarfism, hypopituitary dwarfism, bone regeneration, female<br>
infertility, intrauterine growth retardation, AIDS-related<br>
cachexia, Crohn's disease, burns, as well as other genetic and<br>
metabolic disorders. In one embodiment of this invention, the<br>
disorder is pediatric growth hormone deficiency and treatment<br>
results in annualized growth velocity of between about 7 cm and<br>
about 11 cm in the child undergoing treatment.<br>
[0076] In another embodiment of this invention, a calcium<br>
crystal of hGH or an hGH derivative may serve as a useful<br>
adjunct for bone therapy, as well as treatment of human growth<br>
hormone deficiency in a mammal.<br>
[0077] The present invention also provides methods for<br>
inducing weight gain in a mammal, comprising the step of<br>
administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative. Alternatively, such<br>
methods comprise the step of administering to said mammal a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative and an excipient. In one<br>
embodiment of such methods, the weight gain induced in a<br>
hypophysectomized rat is between about 5% and about 40% after<br>
administration of said crystals by injection once a week.<br>
[0078] Crystals of hGH, crystals of an hGH derivative or<br>
compositions comprising them alone, or with an excipient, may be<br>
administered alone, or as part of a pharmaceutical, therapeutic<br>
or prophylactic preparation. They may be administered by any<br>
conventional administration route including, for example,<br>
parenteral, oral, pulmonary, nasal, aural, anal, dermal, ocular,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal,<br>
mucosal, sublingual, subcutaneous, transdermal, topical, buccal<br>
or intracranial routes.<br><br>
[0079] In one embodiment of the invention, crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative, or compositions comprising them, with or<br>
without an excipient, are administered by oral route or<br>
parenteral route. In a preferred embodiment, crystals of hGH or<br>
an hGH derivative, or compositions comprising them, with or<br>
without an excipient, are administered by subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular route.<br>
[0080] In a preferred embodiment, the crystals or<br>
compositions of this invention, are administered by subcutaneous<br>
route, using a needle having a gauge greater than or equal to<br>
27. In one embodiment of this invention, the needle gauge may<br>
be equal to 30. The crystals or compositions may be<br>
administered from a pre-filled syringe or a meta dose infusion<br>
pump. Alternatively, they may be administered by needle-free<br>
injection.<br>
[0081] This invention advantageously permits sustained<br>
release of hGH into a mammal. In one embodiment, the crystals<br>
or compositions according to this invention are administered<br>
about once a week. In another embodiment, the crystals or<br>
compositions according to this invention are administered about<br>
once every two weeks. In yet another embodiment, the crystals<br>
or compositions according to this invention are administered<br>
about once every month. It will be appreciated by those of<br>
skill in the art that the specific treatment regimen will depend<br>
upon factors such as the disease to be treated, the age and<br>
weight of the patient to be treated, general physical condition<br>
of the patient and judgment of the treating physician.<br>
[0082] According to one embodiment, compositions comprising<br>
crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative according to the present<br>
invention are characterized by an hGH concentration greater than<br>
about 0.1 mg/ml. For example, that concentration may be between<br>
about 0.1 mg/ml and about 100 mg/ml. Alternatively, those<br>
compositions may be characterized by an hGH concentration<br><br>
between about 1 mg/ml and about 100 mg/ml or between about 10<br>
mg/ml and about 100 mg/ml. Such compositions also include the<br>
following components: mannitol - about 0.5 mg/ml to about 100<br>
mg/ml; sodium acetate - about 5 mM to about 250 mM (preferably<br>
about 25 mM to about 150 mM; Tris HCl - about 5 mM to about<br>
100 mM; pH about 6.0 to about 9.0 (preferably about 6.5 to about<br>
8.5); PEG (MW 800 - 8000, preferably 3350, 4000, 6000 or 8000) -<br>
0 to about 25%; protamine, preferably a 3:1 ratio of<br>
hGH:protamine; and polyarginine, preferably a 5:1 ratio of<br>
hGH:polyarginine. Such compositions may optionally comprise:<br>
sucrose - 0 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml; amino acids (e.g.,<br>
arginine and glycine) - 0 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml; preservatives<br>
(antimicrobial, phenol, metacrescol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
parabenzoate (paraben)) - 0% to about 5% (preferably 0% to about<br>
0.9%); and polysorbate - 0 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml. According<br>
to one embodiment, compositions according to this invention are<br>
characterized by 80% effective loading.<br>
[0083] A preferred formulation vehicle according to the<br>
present invention comprises about 100 mM sodium acetate, about<br>
5% PEG 6000 MW and about 25 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5. An hGH<br>
composition prepared using such a vehicle may comprise: about<br>
9.35 mg/ml crystalline hGH and about 1.81 mg/ml polyarginine (or<br>
about 3.12 mg/ml protamine). As will be appreciated by those of<br>
skill in the art, given that compositions according to this<br>
invention may comprise about 1 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml hGH<br>
concentration, the polyarginine (or protamine) concentration<br>
should be adjusted accordingly, so that it is sufficient to<br>
maintain a 5:1 rhGH:polyarginine (w/w) ratio or a 3:1<br>
hGH:protamine (w/w) ratio and maintain low solubility and<br>
release of hGH of about 5 ng'/ml. For example, for the above-<br>
described formulation, if the desired crystalline hGH<br>
concentration is about 20 mg/ml, the polyarginine (or protamine)<br>
concentration should be about 4 mg/ml.<br><br>

citrate, borate, imidazole and glycine. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the crystallization buffer in solution at step (a)<br>
is present at a concentration between about 10 mM and about 800<br>
mM.<br>
[0108] In another embodiment of the above-described method,<br>
the crystallization buffer in step (a) is present at a pH<br>
between about 3 and about 10. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
crystallization buffer is present at a pH between about 6 and<br>
about 9. In yet another preferred embodiment, the<br>
crystallization buffer is present at a pH between about 7.5 and<br>
about 10.<br>
[0109] In another preferred embodiment, the pH of the<br>
crystallization buffer in solution at step (e) of the above-<br>
described method is between about 3 and about 10. In a more<br>
preferred embodiment, the pH of the crystallization buffer in<br><br>
solution is between about 6 and about 9.5. In yet a more<br>
preferred embodiment, the pH of the crystallization buffer in<br>
solution is between about 7.5 and about 9.5.<br>
[0110] In a preferred embodiment, in step (c) of the above-<br>
described method, the precipitant is a non-ionic small molecule<br>
or a non-ionic polymer. In a preferred embodiment, the non-<br>
ionic polymer is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures<br>
thereof. In another preferred embodiment, the PEG has a<br>
molecular weight selected from the group consisting of: between<br>
about 200 and about 8000, about 6000, about 4000 and about 3350.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, PEG is present in the<br>
crystallization solution at a concentration between about 0.5%<br>
and about 20% (w/v). In another preferred embodiment, in<br>
step (c) of the above-described method, the precipitant is<br>
selected from the group consisting of: amino acids, peptides,<br>
polyamino acids and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0111] In another preferred embodiment, in step (f) of the<br>
above-described method, the ionic polymer is selected from the<br>
group consisting of: protamine, polyarginine, polylysine,<br>
polyornithine and octarginine. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
in step (f) of the above-described method, polyarginine is added<br>
in a ratio of hGH:polyarginine (mg:mg) ranging between about 5:1<br>
and about 1:25. In an alternate embodiment, polyarginine is<br>
added in a ratio of hGH:polyarginine (mg:mg) ranging between<br>
about 1:5 and about 1:25. The resulting solution in step (f) is<br>
incubated at a temperature ranging between about 15Â°C and about<br>
37Â°C for about 16 hours to about 48 hours. The effect, of the<br>
polymer on the rate of dissolution of the crystals of hGH or an<br>
hGH derivative is reflected by the number of washes required for<br>
complete dissolution. A control crystal requires about 7 to<br>
about 13 washes for complete dissolution, while a crystal<br>
prepared with polyarginine requires between about 30 to 90<br><br>
identical washes of dissolution buffer for complete dissolution.<br>
Washes are wash steps in a sequential dissolution process (see<br>
Example 5).<br>
[0112] In alternate embodiments of any of the above-described<br>
methods, the calcium salt or the monovalent cation salt may be<br>
present in the crystallization solution at a concentration<br>
between about 0.01 M and about 1 M or between about 25 mM and<br>
about 205 mM. In alternate embodiments of any of the above-<br>
described methods, the crystallization solution is incubated for<br>
a time and a temperature selected from the group consisting of:<br>
between about 0.25 day and about two days at a temperature of<br>
about 33Â°C; between about 0.25 day and about two days at a<br>
temperature of about 25Â°C and between about 0.25 day and about<br>
two days at a temperature of about 15Â°C.<br>
[0113] The present invention also includes methods for<br>
screening crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative for use in a<br>
therapeutic formulation. The steps of such methods include: (1)<br>
washing said crystals of hGH or an hGH derivative with a<br>
dissolution buffer at a temperature of about 37Â°C (for example, 2<br>
mg of crystals and 1 ml of dissolution buffer) and (2) measuring<br>
the in vitro dissolution rate of said crystals of hGH or an hGH<br>
derivative per wash in said dissolution buffer, wherein said in<br>
vitro dissolution rate of said crystals is between about 2% and<br>
about 16% of said crystals for between about 10 minutes and<br>
about 1500 minutes, with about 2 minutes and 32 minutes per wash<br>
step in a sequential dissolution process (see Example 5). The<br>
in vitro dissolution rate of said crystals may also be between<br>
about 4% and about 10% of said crystals over about 15 minutes or<br>
between about 0.04 and about 0.32 mg of said crystals over about<br>
15 minutes.<br>

Analytical Techniques and Assays<br>
[0117] Reversed Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography.<br>
Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatograms (RP-HPLC)<br>
were acquired on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Palo Alto, CA)<br>
equipped with a C5, 5 cm x 4.6 mm, 3 Âµm column (Supelco,<br>
Beliefonte, PA). Samples were dissolved in dissolution buffer<br>
(50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl and 0.02% (v/v) NaN3)<br>
and filtered (0.2 /urn) prior to injection. Elution profiles were<br>
monitored at 214 and 2 80 nm using gradient method of solvents A<br><br>
and B. Solvent-A consisted of 99.9%.deionized water/0.1% TFA.<br>
Solvent B consisted of 99.3% Acetonitrile/O.1% TFA. All<br>
chemicals were HPLC grade obtained from Fisher. Elutions were<br>
performed over 15 min., using a gradient design of 0-2 min 40-<br>
50% B, 2-12 min 50-60% B, and 12-15 60-85% B. A flow rate of 1<br>
ml/min and a column temperature of 35Â°C was maintained throughout<br>
the run. Data was analyzed using Agilent Chemstation software<br>
(Palo Alto, CA).<br>
[0118] The concentration of either protamine or polyarginine<br>
in sample preparations was determined using a gradient method of<br>
solvents A (99.9% deionized water/0.1% TFA) and B (99.9%<br>
acetonitrile/0.1% TFA). Elutions were performed over 20 minutes<br>
at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a gradient design of 0-2.5 min<br>
95:5 (A:B), 2.5-7.5 min 65:35 (A:B), 7.5-15.5 min 25:75 (A:B),<br>

min with intact hGH eluting at 14 min. AUC calculations were<br>
determined at 213 nm. Content of Protamine and/or polyarginine<br>
(mg/ml) additives was calculated from calibration curves<br>
generated from each of the respective additives. This same<br>
method may be used to analyze excipient released from the<br>
complexes.<br>
[0119] Associated degraded hGH was determined with a separate<br>
but similar reversed-phase method. For example, the analysis<br>
was performed on C5 Supelco Discovery Bio Wide Pore Column (5 cm<br>
x 4.6 mm, 3 Âµm particle size, 30 nm pore size) with a thermostat<br>
temperature of 37 Â°C being maintained throughout the run. The<br>
elution profiles were monitored using a gradient method having a<br>
mobile phase A (20% ACN, 80% H2O, 0.1% TFA) and mobile phase B<br>
(20% ACN, 80% 2-propanol, 01.% TFA). The gradient system<br>
changed from 20% to 45% B over 0 to 5 min, from 45% to 55% B<br>
over 5 to 15 min, from 55% to 90% over 15 to 15.1 min, 90% B<br><br>
static until 17 min and immediately following this step, 20% B<br>
was re-established until 20 min was reached.<br>

was carried put as follows. Suspensions of hGH crystals in<br>
mother liquor were washed twice with water to remove excess<br>
mother liquor and then negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl<br>
acetate for 1 hour. The stained hGH crystal suspensions (1-5<br>
tiL) were transferred onto copper TEM grids. Excess liquid was<br>
wicked away and the sample grid briefly air-dried. The TEM grid<br>
was transferred to the sample stage of a JEOL 1210 transmission<br>
electron microscope and images were collected using an 80 KV<br>
electron beam. A very well organized lattice structure was<br><br>
observed inside the crystals, with the orientation in alignment<br>
with the crystal prism axis.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>

[0127] Solubility profile of hGH crystals prepared by salt<br>
induced crystallization. After the incubation of the<br>
crystallization solutions in Examples 1-4, the crystals were<br>
pelleted and the remaining supernatant removed. . The crystal<br>
pellets (0.4 mg) were resuspended in 0.200 ml of dissolution<br>
buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM KC1 and 0.02%<br>

supernatant was completely removed for determination of protein<br>
concentration measured at 280 nm by RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC or UV-VIS.<br>
The crystalline pellets were further resuspended in 0.200 ml of<br>
dissolution buffer and the process repeated until no detectable<br>
protein was measured in the supernatant. This process is<br>
referred to as sequential dissolution.<br>

50 Âµm in length with a crystallization yield of greater than<br>
90%. See Figure 14.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
[0139] Solubility profile of hGH crystals prepared with<br>
polyethylene glycol. After the incubation of the<br>
crystallization solutions prepared in Examples 10-14, the<br>
crystals were pelleted and the remaining supernatant removed.<br>
The crystal pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of dissolution<br><br>
buffer (see Example 5) by either pipetting or vortexing before<br>
being equilibrated for approximately 15 minutes at 37Â°C. The<br>
samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 2 minutes and<br>
the supernatant was removed for determination of protein<br>
concentration measured at 280 nm by RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC or UV-VIS.<br>
The crystalline pellets were further resuspended in dissolution<br>
buffer and the process repeated until no detectable protein was<br>
measured in the supernatant.<br>
[0140] Figure 15 and Table 3 illustrate the solubility<br>
behavior of hGH crystals prepared with 2% PEG-6000/85 mM Ca-<br>
Acetate, 6% PEG-6000/500 mM Na-Acetate, 6% PEG-6000/85 mM CaCl2,<br>
6% PEG-6000/85 mM Ca-Acetate/protamine and 6% PEG-MME-5000/125<br>
mM Ca-Acetate as a function of time in minutes. hGH dissolution<br>
was measured as a cumulative percentage and derived from AUC<br>
values or UV-VIS mg/ml measurements. The results demonstrate<br>
that the hGH crystals prepared by the addition of 6% PEG-6000/85<br>
mM Ca-Acetate/Protamine were the slowest to dissolve, with<br>
complete dissolution occurring after 4 95 minutes. The other<br>
crystals dissolved at 300 minutes for 2% PEG-6000/85 mM Ca-<br>
Acetate crystals or less for the other hGH crystals.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
[0141] Pharmacokinetic study using Sprague-Dawley rats. A<br>
2.5 mg/kg dose of soluble (commercially available) or<br>
crystalline (85 mM Ca-Acetate/2% PEG-6000) hGH, prepared as set<br>
forth in Example 10, suspension was administered subcutaneously<br>
into 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats. The average weight of each<br>
rat was 200 grams. The 24 rats were separated into two groups.<br>
Each group included a subset of 3 groups, each containing 4<br><br>
rats. Bleedings were collected via a jugular vein duct implant<br>
at three specified time points within each subset. Due to the<br>
limited amount of blood able to be drawn at a given time point,<br>
a leap frog design was used. In order to maintain animal<br>
stability, subsets of animals within groups were bled at noted<br>
time points. Serum samples were then compiled to form a linear<br>
progressive timeline. Standard deviations were determined by<br>
the variance of serum levels within subsets at a given time<br>
point from the mean of that subset. See Tables 4-6. In<br>
Tables 4-5, animals designated 1-12 received soluble hGH and<br>
animals 13-24 received crystallized hGH at a dose of 500 ug each<br>
animal.<br>
[0142] Figure 16 illustrates the level of hGH in serum as a<br>
function of time for the soluble and crystallized hGH. The<br>
half-life of the crystallized hGH was almost 19 fold higher than<br>
that of soluble hGH. The time at which maximum hGH appeared in<br>
the serum was 4 hours for the crystallized hGH and 0.5 hours for<br>
the soluble hGH. Given that groups and subsets of rats were<br>
treated with soluble hGH or crystal hGH at a concentration of<br>
5.5 mg/ml, dose equal to 2.2 mg/kg, the Cmax values, listed below<br>
in Table 6, show that hGH when delivered in crystalline form<br>
significantly reduced the maximum serum'concentration compared<br>
to an identical soluble dose. Also, the AUC of total serum<br>
level for hGH soluble versus hGH crystal was similar, indicating<br>
that bioavailability was not significantly affected by<br>
crystallization. A T90% value was calculated for both the soluble<br>
and crystalline results. This parameter indicates the time at<br>
which 90% of the total AUC has occurred. Higher values of T90%<br>
indicate that the drug remains in the serum for longer. The T90%<br>
results contained in Table 6 clearly show that the crystalline<br>
form results in elevated hGH levels for significantly longer<br>
than the soluble form.<br><br><br><br><br>

[0143] Effect of Protamine sulfate on dissolution<br>
characteristics of hGH crystals. Figure 17 illustrates the<br>
amount of hGH crystals prepared according to Example 10 (85 mM<br>
calcium acetate, 2% (v/v) PEG-6000 and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.6))<br>
dissolved after 1 hour incubation in dissolution buffer at 37Â°C<br>
after adding a given amount of protamine sulfate to the pre-<br>
existing calcium hGH crystal solution. The ratios of hGH to<br>
protamine (mg:mg) ratios are indicated in Figure 17. The graph<br>
illustrates that protamine significantly affects dissolution of<br>
hGH crystals.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
[0144] Crystallization of hGH with sodium acetate. Here, a<br>
frozen bulk feed solution of soluble recombinantly-produced hGH<br>
(rhGH) was obtained from two stocks - one derived from E. coli<br>
(Novartis) and the other from yeast (Lucky Gold). Separate<br>
analyses of rhGH derived from E. coli and yeast stock solutions<br>
resulted in rhGH having the same crystallization and solubility<br>
characteristics irrespective of its source. Approximately 3.3<br><br>
ml (10-2 0 mg/ml rhGH as supplied in unknown buffer) of thawed<br>
rhGH feed solution was purified using a lODG-desalting column<br>
supplied by BioRad. Prior to sample loading, the column was<br>
conditioned by washing the column.with 30 ml of Tris-HCl (10 mM,<br>
pH 8.0). The rhGH sample was then loaded and allowed to enter<br>
the column by gravity. After discarding the first three ml of<br>
eluant, another 5.0 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 was then added.<br>
4.5 ml of the desalted rhGH was eluted and collected.<br>
Concentration by centrifugation was then performed using a<br>
Millipore concentrator (MWCO 10,000) at 3500 rpm for 20-30 min.<br>
The concentration of hGH was in range of 3 0 mg/ml, as measured<br>
by absorbance at 280 nm/0.813 (1 mg/ml hGH A2 80 = 0.813<br>
absorbance units). Crystals were grown by adding deionized<br>
water, Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), PEG-6000 and Na-acetate to final<br>
concentrations of 100 mM, 6% (v/v) and 500 mM, respectively in<br>
the total solution with a final protein concentration of 15<br>
mg/ml. The solution was then mixed gently and incubated at 33Â°C<br>
for 12-16 hours. Needle- or rod-like crystals were obtained and<br>
imaged with TEM (FIGS. 18A and 18B). The crystals ranged in<br>
length from approximately 2 to 25 urn. After centrifuging and<br>
pelleting the crystals the supernatant was extracted and,<br>
crystallization yield was measured as greater than 85%. The<br>
crystals can also be formed at temperatures between 33Â°C and 15Â°C<br>
but require increased crystallization time and possibly result<br>
in reduced yield.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
[0145] Complexation of sodium hGH crystals with ionic polymer<br>
additive. After crystallization yield was determined (see<br>
Example 18), sodium rhGH crystals were re-suspended in mother<br>
liquor (250 mM NaOAc, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 6% PEG-6000, and<br>
either 7 mg/ml protamine sulfate or 4.2 mg/ml polyarginine) so<br>
that a final concentration of 21 mg/ml of sodium rhGH crystals<br><br>
was achieved. The protein to additive ratio for rhGH to<br>
protamine sulfate was approximately 3:1 (mg:mg) and for rhGH to<br>
polyarginine was 5:1 (mg:mg). These ratios are calculated to be<br>
mole ratios of approximately 1:1.715 for rhGH:protamine and<br>
approximately 1:0.587 for rhGH:polyarginine. The above rhGH<br>
pellets were homogenously re-suspended in the appropriate mother<br>
liquor and incubated overnight at 2-8Â°C before being centrifuged<br>
to obtain a condensed pellet. The supernatants were removed and<br>
the pellets were re-suspended in the same mother liquor (without<br>
ionic polymer additive) and stored at 4Â°C.<br>
[0146] Additional rhGH:ionic polymer additive ratios may be<br>
obtained by varying the additive concentration (mg/ml) of the<br>
mother liquor while still resuspending to 21 mg/ml of rhGH. For<br>
example, increased concentrations of protamine sulfate (10.5<br>
mg/ml) in the mother liquor can be used to obtain a ratio upon<br>
resuspension of rhGH:additive of 2:1.<br>

Crystallization of rhGH with Zinc-acetate and acetone.<br>
Approximately 3.3 ml (10-20 mg/ml) of thawed rhGH feed solution<br>
was purified using a lODG-desalting column supplied by BioRad.<br>
Prior to sample loading, the column was conditioned by washing<br>
with 30 ml of Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (10 mM, pH 6.1). The rhGH sample<br>
was then loaded and allowed to enter the column by gravity.<br>
After discarding the first three ml of eluant, another 5.0 ml of<br>
10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 pH 6.1 was added. A 4.5 ml aliquot of the<br>
desalted rhGH was eluted and collected. Concentration by<br>
centrifugation was then performed using a Millipore concentrator<br>
(MWCO 10,000) at 3500 rpm for 5-10 min. The concentration of<br>
hGH was in range of 15 mg/ml as measured by absorbance at<br>
280 nm/0.813 (1 mg/ml hGH A280 = 0.813 absorbance units).<br>
Crystals were grown by adding 400 Âµl of mother liquor containing<br><br>
deionized water, 8.91 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 pH 6.1, 0.88 mg/ml Zinc-<br>
acetate, 9.89% Acetone, to 100 Âµl of prepared 15 mg/ml protein<br>
in 10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 6.1) . The solution was then mixed<br>
gently and incubated at 15Â°C for 24-48 hours. Hexagon-like<br>
crystals were obtained ranging in width from approximately 2 to<br>
25 Âµm. After centrifuging and pelleting the crystals the<br>
supernatant was extracted and, crystallization yield was<br>
measured as roughly 55%.<br>

EXAMPLE 22<br>
[0149] Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of<br>
subcutaneously administered hGH using Sprague-Dawley rats and<br>
divalent cation crystals of hGH. The goal of this study was to<br>
assess the controlled release of hGH from hGH crystal<br>
suspensions and the weight gained upon subcutaneous implantation<br>
of hGH crystal suspensions in hypophysectomized Sprague-Dawley<br>
rats. The study design was as follows:<br><br><br><br>
[0150] Upon arrival, 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing<br>
approximately 150 grams + 25 g and being approximately 4-6 weeks<br>
old, were individually housed under controlled conditions<br><br>
(approximate temperature 21 Â± 3Â°C, relative humidity 50 Â± 20%, 12<br>
hours light and 12 hours darkness in each 24-hour period, 10-15<br>
air changes per hour) and given access to purified water and<br>
laboratory chow ad libitum throughout the study. The rats were<br>
allowed to acclimate to the environment for one week prior to<br>
testing.<br>
[0151] Out of the 80 rats, 48 were administered hGH<br>
suspensions according to Table 7. The test compounds were<br>
administered once on day one or once daily for seven consecutive<br>
days as a single bolus injection subcutaneously in the dorsum<br>
area. The site of injection was shaved and marked up to 3 days<br>
prior to dosing and thereafter as required to facilitate<br>
injection. The test compounds were administered using a 30-<br>
gauge x 8 mm needle attached to a 300 Âµl syringe. Test<br>
compounds were carefully inverted in order to ensure suspension<br>
or solution uniformity without causing foaming prior to<br>
withdrawal into the syringe and again prior to administration.<br>
The injection volume was approximately 0.1 ml per rat.<br>
[0152] Blood samples from rats in groups 1, 5, 7 and 8 (each<br>
having 3 rats per group) were collected at 4, 32, 96 and 168<br>
hours following injection on Day 1. Blood samples from rats in<br>
groups 2, 3,4 and 9 (each having 9 rats per group) were further<br>
subdivided into 3 groups of 3 rats. Here, blood samples were<br>
collected from the first subset of rats at 0.5, 24, 72, and 168<br>
hours, from the second subset at 4, 32, 96 and 168 hours and<br>
from the third subset at 8, 48, 120 and 168 hours following<br>
injection on Day 1. Bleedings were typically collected on<br>
unanesthetized or CO2/O2 anesthetized rats through the orbital<br>
sinus and collected in BD Microtainer tubes with serum<br>
separators. Samples were then centrifuged at approximately 4Â°C<br>
and serum recovered and stored frozen (approx. -80Â°C) prior to<br>
determination of hGH and IGF-1 levels.<br><br>
[0153] Serum samples were then compiled and in the case of<br>
groups 2, 3, 4 and 9, a linear progressive timeline was formed.<br>
Standard deviations were determined by the variance of serum<br>
levels within subsets at a given time point from the mean of<br>
that subset. See Tables 8-14 and Figure 19A. Serum levels<br>
(ng/ml) of rhGH are shown when administered in a particular<br>
crystalline formulation. Animals were bled according to the<br>
study protocol at specific time points relative to dosing. The<br>
results clearly indicate that a difference exists between the<br>
absorption of complexed crystalline material (e.g., protamine<br>
and poly-arginine) and non-complexed crystalline formulations<br>
(e.g., CaOAC and ZnOAC).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0154] The weight of each rat was measured and recorded prior<br>
to injection on Day 1 of the study and again on each subsequent<br>
morning of the study prior to bleed time. Accordingly, weight<br>
gain or loss of each rat within each group was calculated by<br>
subtracting the weight of Day 1 (prior to injection) from each<br>
subsequent day (prior to injection). Weight averages for all<br>
rats within a group were calculated for each day. These results<br>
are provided in Table 14.<br><br>
[0155] Table 14 and Figure 19B illustrate the seven-day<br>
effect of administering a single dose (Day 1) of crystals<br>
according to this invention as compared with that of<br>
administering a daily dose of commercially-available hGH. For<br>
example, Figure 19B demonstrates that calcium crystals of hGH<br>
complexed with polyarginine achieves a weight gain comparable to<br>
that of the daily soluble dose with only one dosage over the<br>
same time period. In comparing the weight gained and the<br>
respective release profiles of rhGH in serum, it is evident that<br>
the longer-releasing polyarginine formulation correlates with a<br>
more sustained velocity of weight gain.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
[0156] Comparative pharmacodynamic studies in female juvenile<br>
cynomologous monkeys. The goal of this study was to assess the<br>
in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of crystalline recombinant human<br>
growth hormone (rhGH) when administered subcutaneously to female<br>
cynomologous monkeys. These data were generated in order to<br>
establish a model for controlled release of crystalline rhGH in<br>
blood serum and for weight gain as a function of crystalline<br>
rhGH release.<br><br>
[0157] Twelve female juvenile cynomologous monkeys were<br>
divided into three groups, each having four animals per group,<br>
and were administered either soluble rhGH (Group 1), sodium<br>
crystals of rhGH with PEG and polyarginine (Group 2, according<br>
to Examples 18 and 19) or sodium crystals of rhGH with PEG and<br>
protamine (Group 3, according to Examples 18 and 19). The<br>
monkeys, ranging from 2-6 kg in weight and 4-7 years of age at<br>
the onset of treatment, were individually housed in stainless<br>
steel cages equipped with an automatic watering system or water<br>
bottles. The animal room environment was controlled<br>
(approximately 21Â±3Â°C, 30-70% humidity, 12 hours light and 12<br><br>
hours darkness in each 24-hour period, and 12-20 air changes per<br>
hour) and twice daily, the monkeys were fed a standard certified<br>
commercial primate chow (Harlan Teklad Certified Primate Diet<br>
#2055C).<br>
[0158] This primate study was conducted in order to measure<br>
and compare serum concentrations of hGH and IGF-1 after the<br>
administration of soluble rhGH (Group 1), sodium crystals of<br>
rhGH with PEG and polyarginine (Group 2) and sodium crystals of<br>
rhGH with PEG and protamine (Group 3). Body weights were<br>
recorded for all animals at transfer and prior to dosing on the<br>
times indicated in Table 15 above. Blood samples (approximately<br>
1 ml) were collected from each animal via the femoral, brachial<br>
or saphenous vein on the mornings of days -216, -120, 0, 2, 4,<br>
6, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288<br>
and 312. Blood was collected into serum separating tubes, left<br>
at room temperature for 3 0-45 minutes to allow clotting, and<br>
centrifuged at 2-8Â°C for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Each serum<br>
sample was split into a 100 Âµl aliquot and remaining aliquot,<br>
both of which were stored at -70 Â± 10Â°C prior to analysis.<br>
Typically, the smaller 100 Âµl aliquot was used for rhGH<br>
determination and the larger remainder was used for IGF-1<br>
determination. There were some exceptions, due to volume of<br>
replicates needed.<br>
[0159] Collected serum samples were then analyzed for hGH<br>
concentration (see Table 16). Appropriate dilutions were made<br>
to rhGH concentrations that fell outside the standard value<br>
range. All values were used to obtain an individual per animal<br>
average background level of primate GH. This per animal average<br>
was subtracted from the serum levels measured at each time point<br>
for that test subject. The corrected values per time point were<br>
then averaged to obtain a corrected mean of rhGH in serum.<br>
Standard errors were then calculated by using standard deviation<br>
of the corrected mean and divided by the square root of N=4.<br><br><br>
[0161] The data above demonstrates that the time at which<br>
maximum hGH appeared in the serum (Tmax) was 10 hours for the<br>
polyarginine complexed sodium crystal hGH, 10 hours for the<br>
protamine complexed sodium crystal hGH and 2 hours for the<br><br>
soluble hGH. Even though the soluble hGH was delivered at l/7th<br>
the dose of the crystal administrations, the cmax values listed<br>
above in Table 17 show that hGH when delivered in either of the<br>
complexed crystalline forms significantly reduce the initial<br>
serum concentration spike. In addition, a T90% value has been<br>
calculated for the soluble and crystalline groups. The T90% for<br>
Group 1, the soluble form, was 20 hours, whereas the T90% for<br>
Groups 2 and 3, the complexed crystalline forms, were 74 and 77<br>
hours, respectively. These results clearly show that the<br>
complexed crystalline forms result in elevated hGH levels for<br>
significantly longer times than that of the soluble form.<br>
[0162] In addition to determination of serum concentrations<br>
of hGH, the level of IGF-1 was also measured as a function of<br>
time. By measuring the production of IGF-1, the efficacy of<br>
rhGH was ascertained. Table 18 below reports the IGF-1<br>
concentrations for animals in Groups 1-3. Figure 20B<br>
illustrates that following baseline subtraction of endogenous<br>
IGF-1 levels, complexed crystalline formulations have<br>
demonstrated the ability to stimulate IGF-1 release comparable<br>
to daily soluble administrations. These results, in non-human<br>
primates, indicate that formulations according to this invention<br>
may be advantageously used to achieve similar efficacy in<br>
humans.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 24<br>
[0163] Comparative pharmacodynamic studies in female juvenile<br>
cynomologous monkeys with different protamine ratios. The goal<br>
of this study was to assess the in vivo pharmacokinetic profile<br>
of crystalline recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) when<br>
administered subcutaneously to female cynomologous monkeys.<br>
These data were generated in order to study the effect that the<br>
ratio of sodium hGH to protamine has on the controlled release<br>
of crystalline rhGH in blood serum and for weight gain as a<br>
function of crystalline rhGH release.<br><br>
[0164] In Primate Study II, the twelve female juvenile<br>
cynomologous monkeys described in Primate Study I were divided<br>
into three groups, each having four animals per group, and were<br><br>
administered either soluble rhGH (Group 1), sodium crystals of<br>
rhGH with PEG and protamine (3:1 rhGH:protamine) (Group 2)<br>
(Examples 18 and 19) or sodium crystals of rhGH with PEG and<br>
protamine (2:1 rhGH:protamine) (Group 3) (Examples 18 and 19).<br>
The monkeys, ranging from 2-6 kg in weight and 4-7 years of age<br>
at the onset of treatment, were individually housed in stainless<br>
steel cages equipped with an automatic watering system or water<br>
bottles. The animal room environment was controlled<br>
(approximately 21Â±3Â°C, 30-70% humidity, 12 hours light and 12<br>
hours darkness in each 24-hour period, and 12-2 0 air changes per<br>
hour) and twice daily, the monkeys were fed a standard certified<br>
commercial primate chow (Harlan Teklad Certified Primate Diet<br>
#2055C).<br>
[0165] This primate study was conducted in order to measure<br>
and compare serum concentrations of hGH and IGF-1 after<br>
administration of soluble rhGH (Group 1), sodium crystals of<br>
rhGH with PEG and protamine (3:1 rhGH:protamine) (Group 2) and<br>
sodium crystals of rhGH with PEG and protamine (2:1<br>
rhGH:protamine) (Group 3). Body weights were recorded for all<br>
animals at transfer and prior to dosing on the times indicated<br>
in Table 19 above. Blood samples (approximately 1 ml) were<br>
collected from each animal via the femoral, brachial or<br>
saphenous vein on the mornings of days -144, -120, -96, -72,<br>
48, -24, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192,<br>
216, 240, 264, 288, and 312. Blood was collected into serum<br>
separating tubes, left at room temperature for 3 0-45 minutes to<br>
allow clotting, and centrifuged at 2-8Â°C for 10 minutes at 3000<br>
rpm. Each serum sample was split into a 100 Âµl aliquot and a<br>
remaining aliquot, both of which were stored at -70Â±10Â°C prior<br>
testing.<br>
[0166] Concentrations of hGH (ng/ml) in the collected serum<br>
samples were analyzed and baseline corrected (see data in Table<br>
20). Note that appropriate dilutions were made to rhGH<br><br>
concentrations that fell outside the standard value range.<br>
All values were then used to obtain an individual per animal<br>
average background level of primate hGH. This per animal<br>
average was subtracted from the serum levels measured at each<br>
time point for that test subject. The corrected values per time<br>
point were then averaged to obtain a corrected mean of rhGH in<br>
serum. Standard errors were then calculated by using standard<br>
deviation of the corrected mean and divided by the square root<br>
of N=4.<br><br>
[0167] Figure 21A illustrates the level of rhGH in serum,<br>
after baseline adjustment, as a function of time in hours for<br>
Groups 1, 2 and 3.<br><br><br>
[0168] These data demonstrate that the time at which maximum-<br>
hGH appeared in the serum was 10 hours for the protamine (3:1)<br>
complexed crystal hGH, 24 hours for the protamine (2:1)<br>
complexed crystal hGH and 4 hours for the soluble hGH. Given<br>
that soluble hGH was delivered at l/7th the dose of the crystal<br>
administrations, the Cmax values listed above in Table 22 show<br>
that hGH, when delivered in either complexed crystalline form<br>
significantly reduced the maximum serum concentration. The T90%<br>
for Group 1, the soluble form, was 20 hours, whereas the T90% for<br>
Groups 2 and 3, the complexed crystalline form, were 119 and 72,<br>
respectively. These results clearly indicate that the complexed<br>
crystalline forms result in elevated hGH levels for<br>
significantly longer than the soluble form.<br>
[0169] In addition to determination of serum concentrations<br>
of hGH, the level of IGF-1 was also measured as a function of<br>
time. By measuring the production of IGF-1, the efficacy of<br>
rhGH was ascertained. Table 22 below reports the IGF-1<br>
concentrations for animals in Groups 1-3. Figure 21B<br>
illustrates that following baseline subtraction of endogenous<br>
IGF-1 level, complexed crystalline formulations are capable of<br>
stimulating IGF-1 release comparable to daily soluble<br>
administrations. These non-human primate results indicate that<br>
formulations according to this invention may be advantageously<br>
used to elicit similar efficacy in humans.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 25<br>
[0170] Pharmcocodynamic study of human growth hormone<br>
administered by single or daily subcutaneous injection to<br>
hypophysectomized male rats. The goal of this study was to<br>
compare the efficacy of different formulations of hGH when<br>
administered once or daily for seven consecutive days<br>
subcutaneously to hypophysectomized male Wistar rats. The study<br>
design was as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>
[0171] Upon arrival, 138 male Wistar rats, weighing<br>
approximately 90-100 grams and being approximately 25-30 days<br>
old, were group-housed under controlled conditions (approximate<br>
temperature 23Â±3Â°C, relative humidity 30-70%, 12 hours light and<br>
12 hours darkness in each 24-hour period, 10-15 air changes per<br>
hour) and given access to purified water and laboratory chow ad<br>
libitum throughout the study. The rats were allowed to<br>
acclimate to the environment for two weeks prior to testing.<br>
[0172] The 138 rats were administered samples according to<br>
the concentration, volume and dosing regimen in Table 24. The<br>
test compounds were administered once or once daily for seven<br>
consecutive days as a single bolus injection subcutaneously in<br>
the dorsum area. The site of injection was shaved and marked up<br>
to 3 days prior to dosing and thereafter as required to<br>
facilitate injection. The test compounds were administered<br>
using a 30-gauge x 8 mm needle attached to a 300 Âµl syringe.<br>
Test compounds were carefully inverted in order to ensure<br>
suspension or solution uniformity without causing foaming prior<br>
to withdrawal into the syringe and again prior to<br>
administration.<br>
[0173] Weight gain was measured and recorded twice weekly<br>
during weeks -3 and -2 and daily from days -7 through 14. Rat<br>
weights were approximately 100 g + 10% at dosing. The results<br>
of percent induced growth are presented in Figures 22 and 23 and<br>
summarized in Tables 25 and 26. In Table 25 "high dose"<br>
represents 5.6 mg/kg/week. The data illustrates the comparison<br>
of the weight gain of rats having a single injection of<br>
rhGH:polyarginine (Group 7, Examples 18 and 19) or<br>
rhGH:protamine (Groups 9 and 10, Examples 18 and 19) crystals<br>
over a seven day period versus a daily injection of control<br>
(Group 1, no hGH) or soluble hGH samples (Groups 4 and 5) over<br>
the same seven day period. Group 1, Sham Hypophysectomy rats,<br>
shows the normal growth over a seven day period. Moreover, rats<br><br>
having been administered rhGH:polyarginine (Group 7) had a<br>
higher percent induced growth with one injection over seven days<br>
than those rats that were administered soluble hGH (Group 5)<br>
each day for seven days. These results illustrate that hGH<br>
crystals and formulations according to the present invention are<br>
as efficacious as daily soluble rhGH administered over one week.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 26<br>
[0174] Crystallization of hGH with sodium acetate and<br>
protamine sulfate. Here, a frozen bulk feed solution of soluble<br>
recombinantly-produced hGH (rhGH) was obtained from two stocks -<br>
one derived from E. coli (Novartis) and the other from<br><br>
yeast(Lucky Gold). Separate analyses of rhGH derived from E.<br>
coli and yeast stock solutions resulted in rhGH having the same<br>
crystallization and solubility characteristics irrespective of<br>
its source. Approximately 3.3 ml (10-20 mg/ml) of thawed rhGH<br>
feed solution was purified using a lODG-desalting column<br>
supplied by BioRad. Prior to sample loading, the column was<br>
conditioned by washing the column with 30 ml of Tris-HCl (10 mM,<br>
pH 8.0). The rhGH sample was then loaded and allowed to enter<br>
the column by gravity. After discarding the first three ml of<br>
eluant, another 5.0 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 was added. 4.5<br>
ml of the desalted rhGH was eluted and collected. Concentration<br>
by centrifugation was then performed using a Millipore<br>
concentrator (MWCO 10,000) at 3500 rpm for 20-30 min. The<br>
concentration of hGH was in range of 30 mg/ml as measured by<br>
absorbance at 280 nm/0.813 (1 mg/ml hGH A280 = 0.813 absorbance<br>
units). Crystals were grown by adding deionized water, Tris-HCl<br>
(pH 8.6), PEG-4000, Protamine sulfate and Na-acetate to final<br>
concentrations of 100 mM, 6% (v/v), 2 mg/ml and 500 mM,<br>
respectively, in the total solution with a final protein<br>
concentration of 15 mg/ml. The solution was then mixed gently<br>
and incubated at 33Â°C for 12-16 hours. Needle-like crystals were<br>
obtained ranging in length from approximately 2 to 25 urn. After<br>
centrifuging and pelleting the crystals the supernatant was<br>
extracted and, crystallization yield was measured as greater<br>
than 90%.<br>
