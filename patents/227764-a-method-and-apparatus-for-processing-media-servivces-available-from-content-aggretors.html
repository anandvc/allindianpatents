				<td>A Method and Apparatus for Acquiring Media Servicers Available from Content<br>
Aggregators<br>
[0001]	This invention is related to the field of indexing, acquiring,<br>
and playing media services, particularly media services in the form of streaming<br>
media available from a plurality of content aggregators.<br>
[0002]	Listening to radio broadcast programming, such as music,<br>
news, and talk shows, is a commonly enjoyed form of media entertainment that<br>
are typically sent as radio transmissions through the airwaves.<br>
[0003]	Radio transmissions have problems that arise due to the<br>
inherent physical limitations of using radio waves. For example, radio waves lose<br>
power the further they are from their broadcast source, whereby it becomes<br>
difficult for a receiver to reliably receive and demodulate a broadcast from a long<br>
distance. This limitation makes it difficult for listeners to receive their favorite<br>
stations if outside of a geographic region (e.g., a person who lives in Boston<br>
typically can not receive a radio broadcast from Los Angeles). Additionally, the<br>
frequencies of radio broadcasts have to be tightly controlled because the<br>
airwaves can only accommodate a finite number of electronic-magnetic waves<br>
before interference results.<br>
[0004]	The limitations of broadcasting via radio waves are overcome<br>
by using alternative broadcasting techniques. One approach transmits radio<br>
station broadcasts as satellite transmissions that are received through a satellite<br>
dish coupled to an audio decoder. Satellite broadcasts have a further geographic<br>
range than radio wave based transmissions. Also, satellite transmissions can<br>
accommodate more radio stations broadcasts than broadcasted as radio waves,<br>
by using techniques as multiplexing and data compression increasing the<br>
bandwidth efficiency of a transmission. Satellite broadcasts are limited in<br>
programming choices available, because the radio stations are selected by<br>
satellite broadcasters and broadcasting via satellite is cost prohibitive, which<br>
may underrepresent the broadcasting choices available from small media<br>
markets.<br><br>
[0005]	The amount of programming choices available to a listener (or<br>
viewer) has increased since the development of radio and video transmissions<br>
through a communications network such as the Internet. Radio and video<br>
services (referred to as media services) that were otherwise limited by<br>
geographic bandwidth or other constraints are broadcasted around the world via<br>
the Internet. Any user who possesses a connection to the Internet and an<br>
Internet enabled device (computer, cellular phone, MP3 music player, Internet<br>
appliance, satellite receiver) can receive a media service broadcasted in the form<br>
of streaming media. The media service is encoded and compressed, typically by<br>
a computer, into packets that conform to a transport protocol, such as TCP/IP.<br>
The packets are routed to a listener's device through the Internet, in that<br>
software on the listener's decoding device (e.g., a computer with a media player<br>
as REALPLAYER™, MACROMEDIA PLAYER™, and MP3PRO™) decompresses and<br>
decodes the packets into an audio/video signal for playback on an output device<br>
(computer, receiver, stereo, television set).<br>
[0006]	The Internet provides a listener with the ability to access<br>
thousands of media services. The music genres available to a user are equally as<br>
expansive, as a user can select to hear a sub-genre of a music genre (e.g., a rock<br>
and roll station "music genre" that plays 1980's new wave music "sub-genre").<br>
The listener also can manipulate the songs (media objects) or content heard into<br>
a playlist, which is organized by the preferences of the listener. These<br>
broadcasts are accessed choosing a link (uniform resource indicator URI) to a<br>
music file on a website or by using a media player that receives streaming feeds<br>
of media services. Within all of these customizable options, it is difficult for a<br>
user to find all of the media services available because the content on the<br>
Internet is chaotically organized.<br>
[0007]	One development for organizing media services available<br>
through the Internet is the use of a tuning service or a media subscription<br>
service. These type of services (alternatively known as content aggregators),<br>
such as MUSICMATCI-T, LIVE365™, and STREAMWAVES™ bring together a<br>
plurality of media services to a common point or interface (e.g., a website, a<br><br>
streaming media player with channels) with an architecture where a user selects<br>
media services from categories including genre and performer. A tuning service is<br>
typically proprietary to protect the copyrighted material comprising media<br>
services and requires an interface to successfully use the tuning service to<br>
playback an available media service. The restrictions of using a proprietary tuning<br>
service typically limits a user from activating media services available from<br>
different content aggregators, without switching to an additional device.<br>
[0008]	In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a<br>
method and apparatus are disclosed that enable the indexing and acquisition of<br>
media services from a plurality of content aggregators. A listing of media<br>
services is generated by the indexing of available media services from the<br>
plurality of content aggregators. The method and apparatus also describe the<br>
retrieval and output of a selected media service available from the plurality of<br>
content aggregators to a playback device.<br>

[0016]	FIG. 8 is a diagram of requesting and acquiring music services<br>
from a plurality of content aggregators by using a control point.<br>
[0017]	FIG. 9 is a diagram of a content list of media services a<br>
playback device receives from a content aggregator as computer code.<br>
[0018]	FIG. 10 is a diagram of a content list of media services<br>
formatted to the internal data structure of a playback device by a content<br>
adapter.<br>
[0019]	FIG. 11 is a display of a content list of media services<br>
formatted into a menu by a XML parser.<br>
[0020]	In FIG. 1, a composition of media services available to a<br>
content aggregator 102 is shown. Audio based media services, as audio website<br>
104, radio station 106, music service 108, originating as audio based feeds<br>
(e.g., music, talk radio show, streaming media files, baseball game, audio from a<br>
television program, audio books), and video station 109 (e.g., CNN®, ABC®,<br>
DIRECTV®) are media services available to content aggregator 102 through<br>
communications network 110 (e.g., Internet, Public Switched Telephone<br>
Network (PSTN), Local Area Network (LAN), wireless network, Digital Subscriber<br>
Line (DSL), peer to peer network). Preferably, the media services are coupled to<br>
content aggregator 102 via communications network 110 with the media<br>
services transmitted as packets conforming to a TCP/IP protocol. Optionally,<br>
content aggregator 102 receives audio and video feeds that are transmitted<br>
through a wireless interface (radio frequency, microwaves, infrared) or receives<br>
media objects (e.g., audio-video files that are pre-recorded or real time feeds<br>
transmitted as streaming media) that are stored locally at the site of the content<br>
aggregator 102 (such as in a hard disk drive, optical storage, removable storage<br>
device, or magnetic tape).<br><br>
[0021]	The media services available for transmission comprise audio<br>
and video feeds. Audio website 104 is an Internet based website that comprises<br>
audio based media services that are transmitted in the form of streaming media<br>
or are computer files partially or completely transmitted. Optionally, the media<br>
services may purport to a type of media file format (e.g., REALAUDIO®,<br>
REALMEDIA®, APPLE QUICKTIME®, MICROSOFT® WINDOWS MEDIA™ FORMAT,<br>
MPEG-2 LAYER III AUDIO, and MP3®) that is played back via a media player<br>
(REALPLAYER®, WINAMP®, and MICROSOFT® WINDOWS MEDIA™ PLAYER).<br>
Radio station 106 is a content provider that broadcasts radio programs as audio<br>
based streamed media services. The broadcasts may be live or prerecorded.<br>
Music service 108 is a media service that is subscription based (e.g., MUSAK®,<br>
MUSIC CHOICE®) that broadcasts programming as an audio based media service<br>
available through the content aggregator 102. Video feed 109 is a media service<br>
that is transmitted from a television station (e.g., CNN, ABC ) or as a video<br>
service (e.g., a movie on demand) available to content aggregator 102.<br>
[0022]	In accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br>
content aggregator 102, in an alternative embodiment, exists as a web resource<br>
(e.g., website, index, catalog) that comprises Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs)<br>
that link to the location of media services. A playback program (e.g., a<br>
streaming media player) directly accesses a media service at its listed location<br>
(by using the listed link) instead of receiving the media service directly from<br>
content aggregator 102. Content aggregator 102 may comprise an index of links<br>
to the location of media services and may have media services that are<br>
transmitted directly from content aggregator 102.<br>
[0023]	Uniform resource indicators (URIs) are a universal set of<br>
names that refer to existing protocols or name spaces that identify resources<br>
(e.g., website, streaming media server,), services (e.g., videos on demand,<br>
internet radio), devices (e.g., mobile phone, internet enable appliance), and data<br>
files (e.g., media files and text documents). A URL is a form of a URI that<br>
expresses an address that maps to an access algorithm using network protocols<br><br>
(e.g., TCP/IP or a MPEG transport scheme). When a URL is used, a specific<br>
resource, service, device, or data file may be accessed and/or manipulated. An<br>
alternative form of a URI known as an Internet protocol number or address (IP) is<br>
a series of numbers that refers to a specific resource, service, or data file.<br>
Optionally, a URL is mapped to an IP number, typically through a Domain Name<br>
Server (DNS), that provides two ways to access a desired resource (e.g., a<br>
resource is accessed either by using the domain name www.whitehouse.gov or<br>
the IP address 198.137.240.91).<br>
[0024]	FIG. 2 illustrates a connection between Internet enabled<br>
devices (a playback device 202, cable set top box 204, computer, cellular<br>
phone, MP3 player, video game system) and a plurality of content aggregators.<br>
Content aggregator 102 receives audio based media services from audio website<br>
104 and radio station 106. An Internet enabled device, such as playback device<br>
202, accesses content aggregator 102 via a communications network 110 (e.g.,<br>
Internet).<br>
[0025]	Playback device 202 communicates with content aggregator<br>
102 to request a listing of media services available from content aggregator 102<br>
and to receive media services selected from the list of media services.<br>
Preferably, the communications are procedural calls and requests comprising<br>
computer commands, for example hypertext markup language (HTML) or<br>
extensible markup language (XML) based requests, transported as packets<br>
adhering to a transport structure (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet<br>
Protocol (TCP/IP)) through communications network 110. The procedural calls<br>
are formatted through the use of an application programming interface (API).<br>
This interface comprises a series of functions that are used by a program or<br>
device to initiate a specific action (for example, an Internet enabled device uses<br>
an audio API to control a soundcard for the playback of an audio based media<br>
service).<br>
[0026]	Playback device 202, as an Internet enable device, contains<br>
hardware and software (APIs and program subroutines) for communicating and<br><br>
interacting with content aggregator 102. Preferably, playback device 202<br>
comprises central processing unit (CPU) 214, program memory 216, data<br>
memory 218, an audio speaker 220, display device 222, and input device 224.<br>
CPU 214 (a computer processor) processes audio services received from the<br>
content aggregator 102, received via communications network 110. CPU 214 is<br>
coupled to data memory 218 that stores data received from the content<br>
congregator 102 and selected media services. Program memory 216, connected<br>
to CPU 214, stores programming instructions and APIs used to communicate<br>
with and process the media services obtained from content aggregator 102.<br>
[0027]	Display device 222 displays the program genres and sub-<br>
genres of audio based media services available from content aggregator 102.<br>
Preferably, display device 222 is a television display, LED display, or LCD<br>
display. The genres and sub-genres are selected by using input device 224 by<br>
engaging a button, dial, or touch screen interface, or other tactile mechanism<br>
available on input device 224. CPU 204 requests (via a command such as a<br>
computer command or a procedural call) an audio based media service (in this<br>
example from a radio station 106) through content aggregator 102, after the<br>
media service was selected via input device 224. Content aggregator 102<br>
receives the request from playback device 202 and, in response, sends the<br>
selected media service to playback device 202 in the form of a packetized<br>
transmission. Playback device 202 processes the media service and outputs the<br>
results through connected audio speaker (loudspeaker) 220. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the selected media service is video based and is outputted to<br>
display device 222.<br>
[0028]	Set top box 204 is an Internet enabled device that receives<br>
audio and video based media services from, for example, cable or broadcast<br>
television stations. Preferably, set top box 204 is a conduit for media services<br>
that are multi-threaded or multiplexed by set top box 204 to devices that are not<br>
Internet enabled (e.g., stereo receiver 206 and television audio output 208). For<br>
example, set top box 204 receives a classical music based media service, which<br><br>
set top box 204 sends to stereo receiver 206. At the same time, set top box<br>
204 receives a newscast media service that is transmitted to coupled television<br>
208. Optionally, set top box 204 transmits audio services to an attached data<br>
network 210 (e.g., Ethernet network, wireless RF network, power line based<br>
network, or infrared network) that is connected to output device 212 (connector<br>
or audio speaker) that outputs the media services as a signal.<br>
[0029]	Multi-threading operates by set top box 204 dividing up its<br>
processing tasks (housekeeping tasks, data retrieval, processing data, outputting<br>
data) into a number of timeslots. Each processing task is allocated a number of<br>
timeslots. Processing tasks of a high priority (playback of a media service)<br>
receive a larger number of timeslots than other processing tasks (updating the<br>
display of available media services). The times slots as allocated in accordance<br>
with a predetermined procedure. In the current example, set top box 204 divides<br>
each second into ten timeslots: four timeslots are allocated for the classical<br>
music media service, four timeslots are for the newscast media service, and the<br>
remaining two timeslots are for housekeeping procedures. Set top box 204 then<br>
processes the media services and performs housekeeping tasks in accordance<br>
with the timeslots allocated. An embodiment of the invention supports that time<br>
slots durations may be unequal or equal amounts of time.<br>
[0030]	FIG. 3 shows a flowchart of a method of configuring a device<br>
(playback device 202 or set top box 204) to the same data format as content<br>
aggregator 102 for acquiring and outputting selected media services. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, playback device 202 communicates with a content<br>
aggregator 102 through communications network 110 in accordance with<br>
computer instructions controlling the CPU 214. The computer instructions<br>
comprising an API operating through specific procedural calls. The API requests<br>
parameters from content aggregator 102 via a SetServiceCall in step 302. The<br>
parameters transmitted to playback device develop a data and communication<br>
structure used by playback device 202 to communicate with content aggregator<br>
102. The communication structure is the format used to communicate data<br><br>
between playback device 202 and content aggregator 102. Preferably, the<br>
playback device 202 conforms with TCP/IP, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)<br>
protocol, 3G, or WAP based transport protocols architectures. Accordingly,<br>
playback device 202 determines the communications structure of content<br>
aggregator 102 by using a handshake process and receiving data back that<br>
comports to a predetermined communications structure. Also, playback device<br>
202 passively receives a data stream from content aggregator 102, whereby<br>
playback device 202 determines the communication structure based upon key<br>
attributes that exist in the data stream. For example, playback device 202 reads<br>
a header of a received data packet and determines that the data packet comports<br>
to a MPEG transport and data scheme.<br>
[0031]	For example, a sample data structure comprises media<br>
service menus, the locations (URIs) and types of media service formats (Real<br>
Audio, Microsoft Media Player, MP3) available from the providers of the media<br>
services that correspond to a style sheet Playback device 202 receives the style<br>
sheet from content aggregator 102 and formats incoming and outgoing data<br>
accordingly. Preferably, the determination of data structure comprises a<br>
document object model (DOM) comprising three levels. Level 1 establishes the<br>
format governing the exchange of data (e.g., XML and HMTL). Level 2 controls<br>
presentation and manipulation of data being transmitted (using style sheets).<br>
Level 3 defines a content model (e.g., data variables and metadata fields) and<br>
events used for a document (function key F12 saves a document). Optionally,<br>
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) compliant classes and object types<br>
are used to define the objects available. Playback device 202 stores data<br>
structure parameters from content aggregator 102 into the program memory<br>
216, in step 304, and formats future communications with the content<br>
aggregator 102 accordingly.<br>
[0032]	The use of a DOM allows playback device 202 to support<br>
new document types and media formats as multimedia standards adjust. For<br>
example, a new content aggregator uses a new multimedia player to play back<br><br>
available media services. Playback device 202, when requesting a media service<br>
from the new content aggregator, will read the corresponding DOM and locate<br>
the new multimedia player (either by a embedded locator in the DOM or by<br>
referring to an external database). Playback device 202 then requests a codec<br>
(update) for the new media player, which is stored once the codec is received.<br>
The media service is ready to be outputted by playback device 202 using the<br>
new media player.<br>
[0033]	With the data structure parameters stored, playback device<br>
202 requests a content list of media services from content aggregator 102 via a<br>
List_Content_Call issued by CPU 214, in step 306. As displayed in FIG. 4, the<br>
List_Content_CalI comprises an Iradio API 412 that initiates an Iradio Request<br>
API 402 (stored in program memory 216) that allocates and manages the internal<br>
resources used for the content list request. Preferably, CPU 214 designates<br>
operational cycles for the content list request and designates space in the data<br>
memory 218 for the storage of a content list. Optionally, Request API 402<br>
manages multiple requests for content lists from a plurality of content<br>
aggregators 102, simultaneously.<br>
[0034]	CPU 214 then issues a HTTP processor API 404 subroutine<br>
that controlling the communication transmissions with content aggregator 102.<br>
HTTP processor API 404 functions in accordance with the parameters stored in<br>
step 302 by managing the connection, communications, and HTTP protocol<br>
exchange with the content aggregator 102. This includes all processing related<br>
to HTTP URI redirection, error recognition, and response classification as a<br>
standard response to a stream comprising a media service. HTTP processor API<br>
404 transmits the content list request to content aggregator 102 via<br>
communications network 110. Content aggregator 102 responds by transmitting<br>
a content list of available media services received through HTTP processor API<br>
404.<br>
[0035]	After receiving the content list, preferably in a predetermined<br>
format, CPU 214 initiates content adapter 406 routine that formats the received<br><br>
content list to an internal format of data and an internal data structure used by<br>
playback device 202. For example, CPU 214 uses a XML (internal format of<br>
data) based document type definition (DTD) that predefines the internal data<br>
structure (data fields) used for playback device 202. Data received from the<br>
content aggregator 102, in a XML format, is directly matched to the data fields<br>
defined by the DTD. If the data received from content aggregator 102 does not<br>
comply with the internal data format (XML), content adapter 406 formats the<br>
data into XML, preferably by the use of translation tables, and associates the<br>
formatted data into the internal data structure (DTD) of playback device 202.<br>
Optionally, the formatted data and data received from content aggregator 102<br>
are stored in data memory 218. Also, the DTD is updateable (for example, an<br>
update sent as a style sheet via the Internet 110 overwrites an existing DTD).<br>
[0036]	XML parser 408 receives the XML. based data from the<br>
content adapter 406 (or from the data memory 218), and maps the XML based<br>
data to preselected menu elements that are displayed and manipulated by a user.<br>
The data mapping accomplished via a data table that indicates which variables<br>
from the internal data structure are mapped to preselected menu elements.<br>
[0037]	FIG. 9 is a diagram of a content list of media services 900 (in<br>
XML format) the playback device 202 receives from content aggregator 102.<br>
FIG. 10 is a display of a content list of media services 1000 formatted to the<br>
internal data structure of the playback device 202 by the content adapter 406.<br>
FIG. 11 is a display of a content list of media services 1100 formatted into a<br>
menu by the XML parser 408.<br>
[0038]	As an exemplary embodiment, data formatted by the XML<br>
parser 408, is displayed as a hierarchical menu on display device 222. The<br>
hierarchical menu lists fields that are either preselected or designated by a user<br>
(sample fields are media service, title, media type, performer, content aggregator<br>
source, etc.). For example, a "top" level of the menu is displayed by genre (e.g.,<br>
talk show, music, news, sports talk, mystery, soap opera, etc.). When a user<br>
selects a genre listed on the "top" menu level via input device 224, content data<br><br>
procedure 410 initiated by CPU 214 checks data memory 218 if there are any<br>
sub-genres or available media services listed in association with the selected<br>
genre. Alternatively, content data procedure 410 issues an additional content list<br>
call 401 to content aggregator 102 for more information that is associated with<br>
the selected genre (repeating the steps discussed above). Content data<br>
procedure 410 generates and displays from the associated data a "second" level<br>
menu listed underneath the "top" level. The user then makes a selection from<br>
the "second" level, and content data procedure 410 continues to issue content<br>
list calls 401, until the user selects a media service for playback.<br>
[0039]	After a media service is selected via input device 224 (e.g.,<br>
from a hierarchical m«nu or a listing of available media services), CPU 214 issues<br>
an IradioStreamContentscall API, in step 308, to retrieve the selected media<br>
service from the content aggregator 102. The IradioStreamContentscall API,<br>
as displayed in FIG. 6, begins with a Stream Request Call 602 that determines a<br>
location of the requested media service (preferably the media service's URI)<br>
either through data returned from the Iradio_List_ContentCall (in data memory<br>
218) or through other means (e.g., as requesting the location of the media<br>
service from the content aggregator 102). Optionally,<br>
IradioStreamContentscall API 308 supports asynchronous (multiple) requests<br>
for media services via the multithreading capability described above.<br>
[0040]	Once the location of the selected media service is known, the<br>
CPU 214 issues an Iradio API 412 that starts with the Request API 402<br>
subroutine for allocating and managing resources used for the Stream Request<br>
Call 602. HTTP processor API 404 is issued, as part of Iradio API 412, to<br>
connect to the location of the selected media service via the communications<br>
network 110. The connection to the location of the media service is a direct<br>
connection (website, storage device, cellular network, etc.), a connection made<br>
through content aggregator 102 to the location of the media service, or a<br>
connection that is redirected to the location of the media service. HTTP<br>
processor API 404 also manages the details of locating stream data in the<br><br>
response that comes from the requested media service's location. The request<br>
for a media service is preferably made as a HTTP or MIME compliant request<br>
containing information about the resources required to playback the media<br>
service (such as a media player). Along with standard HTTP redirect processing,<br>
HTTP processor API 404 analyzes the HTTP response header to determine<br>
whether the response is a stream, media file, or other type of multimedia format<br>
(e.g. a REALPLAYER® based stream, a non-streamed MP3 file, or a video signal).<br>
Once the determination is made, HTTP processor API 404 accepts data<br>
comprising the selected media service.<br>
[0041]	As the data comprising the media service is transmitted to<br>
playback device 202, HTTP processor 404 routes the data to buffer 604<br>
(contained in data memory 218). Buffer 604 preferably outputs data in a first in<br>
first out (FIFO) scheme. Optionally, buffer 604 comprises a plurality of memory<br>
banks that queue data in accordance with a predetermined method (e.g., shared<br>
memory, memory interleaving, memory address cycling, etc.) enabling the<br>
request and delivery of multiple media services via the multithreading capability<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0042]	Content adapter 406 accesses and processes the data<br>
comprising the media service that is stored in buffer 604. Preferably, the<br>
processing of media service data depends upon information that is contained in<br>
the response header or footer of the media service data (e.g., indicating the<br>
format of the media service, the corresponding playback application 608, output<br>
requirements of the media service). Processing examples performed by the<br>
content adapter 406 include decompressing the data, analyzing metadata in the<br>
media service data (e.g., metadata that describes the media service), or applying<br>
preselected audio or video effects.<br>
[0043]	The media service data, once processed, is sent to player<br>
application 608 (media player) that outputs or "plays" media service data in, step<br>
310. The player application is a media complaint decoder (e.g., REALPLAYER,<br>
MPEG-1 Layer-3, MICROSOFT MEDIA PLAYER, QUICKTIME, MPEG-4, DivX) that<br><br>
decodes the media service data into a decoded audio/video signal that is ready<br>
for output to a media device (e.g., audio speaker, video screen, audio/video<br>
receiver, transmission device).<br>
[0044]	Player application 608 will keep playing the media service<br>
until the content adapter 406 runs out of data received from buffer 604 (starting<br>
playback of another media service), or the media service is terminated via a<br>
return code in step 312, whereby the media service is told to stop transmitting.<br>
Preferably, the return code is issued from content adapter 406 to HTTP<br>
processor 404 that sends a "cancel" command to the location of media service<br>
via the communications network 110 to terminate the transmission of media<br>
service data. The return code results from sources including, as examples, a user<br>
issuing a cancel command, an overflow/underflow error, not enough available<br>
memory, network congestion, output device not connected, etc. Optionally, CPU<br>
214 has diagnostic circuitry that recognizes an error that results in the<br>
cancellation of the transmission of a media service via a return code.<br>
[0045]	As described above, an embodiment of the invention breaks<br>
up the processing demands of service requests, I/O (Input and Output) routines,<br>
and data conversion into distinct threads. The threads are dynamically<br>
categorized and allocated computer resources (by a predetermined method), in<br>
order to fulfill desired requests and housekeeping routines for the invention. The<br>
benefit of this approach is that requests can be processed by a system in<br>
accordance with this invention simultaneously, without the conflicts or delays<br>
induced by the processing of other requests.<br>
[0046]	In addition, the use of threads to process API requests allows<br>
application designers to choose whether or not they want to use synchronous or<br>
asynchronous interfaces to implement API services. This feature provides for<br>
APIs to be implemented within a vast majority of programs without forcing<br>
application designers to develop infrastructure around the API for managing its<br>
service characteristics.<br><br>
[0047]	The threads communicate with each other via a unique<br>
memory buffer queue that resides in data memory 218. The threads put and<br>
retrieve buffers (in data memory 218) from named queues, and when done with<br>
a buffer, release the buffer to a buffer pool comprising a plurality of buffers. The<br>
buffer queue enables the invention to designate specific threads to specific<br>
buffers, optimizing the storage and access of media service data when<br>
processing multiple media services.<br>
[0048]	Access to the memory buffer queue's data structure is<br>
protected by semaphore primitives, which may be implemented as a binary flag.<br>
The use of semaphore primitives allow for the media service data to be shared<br>
across threads without corruption of the data management structures. For<br>
example, when a thread requests a buffer from the memory buffer queue, all<br>
management of data structures that track the queue buffer are performed after<br>
locking a semaphore primitive that guarantees exclusive access to the data<br>
structures.<br>
[0049]	Queue retrievals of data from the memory buffers (in data<br>
storage 218), supports both a blocking and a non-blocking mode. In the blocking<br>
mode, the thread will stop processing and wait on the buffer to be presented,<br>
which could be an indeterminate amount of time. This blocking mechanism<br>
allows CPU 214 resources to be balanced across the threads. For example, the<br>
content adapter will process a buffer and send the buffer to the player<br>
application via a queue that empties the buffer. When the buffer is waiting to be<br>
filled, the content adapter will ignore (block) the buffer until it is filled by the I/O<br>
thread, freeing up the content adapter to access other filled buffers. The non-<br>
blocking mode accesses a memory buffer whether it is filled or empty (reducing<br>
the content adapter's efficiency).<br>
[0050]	As described in step 310, the invention optionally operates in<br>
a synchronous or asynchronous mode. Preferably, in accordance with the<br>
principles of the present invention, the asynchronous mode operates with<br>
callback functions, whereby the CPU 214 initiates a process (API) and<br><br>
designates the process to a specific thread. CPU 214 also designates a<br>
corresponding callback function for the procedure that terminates the procedure<br>
(API) when the callback function is returned to CPU 214. For example, when an<br>
IradioListContentCall 306 (requesting a list of media services) is initiated by<br>
CPU 214, a thread and a callback function are issued by CPU 214 that<br>
corresponds to the procedure. As the thread corresponding to the procedure is<br>
executed, the callback function is passed to a pointer that responds to a<br>
predetermined condition specified for the procedure (e.g., the transmission of the<br>
content list from content aggregator 102 triggers the callback function back to<br>
CPU 214). During this time, additional procedures run on other threads. The<br>
pointer, after the condition is met, issues a callback function to CPU 214 that<br>
terminates the thread executing the procedure.<br>
[0051]	Alternatively, the synchronous usage model does not utilize<br>
callback functions. The functionality is the same of the asynchronous mode, but<br>
only a single (current) procedure is run at a time, effectively blocking all other<br>
procedures until the current procedure is serviced or an error results (terminating<br>
the current procedure). CPU 214 begins a "new" procedure after the current<br>
procedure terminates and memory space in data memory 218 is cleared with a<br>
release command (ReleaseRespond).<br>
[0052]	FIG. 7 displays an embodiment of the invention for combining<br>
the list of media services available from two content aggregators 102. Step 702<br>
begins with a request for a list of media services by CPU 214 to a first media<br>
content aggregator. CPU 214 executes an IradioSet Service call that builds a<br>
set of commands used to access first content aggregator 102 (in accordance<br>
with FIGS. 3 and 4 described above). A follow-up IradioContentList call is<br>
assigned to a thread for processing, freeing CPU 214 for other processing tasks.<br>
First HTTP processor API 404 receives the thread and initiates the retrieval of<br>
the list of media services from first media content aggregator 102.<br>
[0053]	Step 704 entails a request for a second list of media service<br>
available from a second media content aggregator 102. CPU 214 executes a<br><br>
second IradioSetService call that builds a set of commands for accessing<br>
second content aggregator 102 (in accordance with FIGS. 3 and 4 described<br>
above). An lradio_Content_List call is then assigned to a second thread, which is<br>
received by second HTTP processor API 404 that accesses and retrieves the list<br>
of media services from second content aggregator 104. Optionally, the first and<br>
second HTTP processor API 404 are the combined into one HTTP processor unit<br>
404, which may be contained within CPU 214.<br>
[0054]	In Step 706, the first HTTP processor API 404 performs a<br>
Get command (e.g., HTTP Get Command) used to request the list of media<br>
services from first content aggregator 102. Preferably, the Get command is<br>
transmitted as a HTML or XML based request.<br>
[0055]	Step 708 involves the response to the Get command by first<br>
content aggregator 102. Preferably, first content aggregator 102 transmits a list<br>
of media service to first HTTP processor API 404 that determines the integrity of<br>
the list (e.g., does the list comply with a format recognized by first HTTP<br>
processor API 404?). Alternatively, if the list of media services is corrupted, the<br>
Get command (in step 706) is repeated a predetermined number of times, before<br>
first HTTP processor API 404 times out and returns an error message to CPU<br>
214. In Step 710, first HTTP processor API 404 collects data comprising the list<br>
of media services from first content aggregator and forwards the list to content<br>
adapter 406 for additional processing.<br>
[0056]	Step 712, content adapter 406 receives the list of media<br>
services and invokes the appropriate transformation routine (e.g., converting the<br>
received list into the internal format of the invention via lookup tables) to create<br>
a common (internal) content list data structure containing genres and sub-genres<br>
of media services. This common content list may be used to generate a viewable<br>
list of media service that is displayed on display device 222. Preferably, the<br>
genres and sub-genres of media services are determined by metadata within the<br>
list of media services, or by matching the metadata to an external database (e.g.,<br>
CDDB™ and MUZE™). In accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br><br>
media services may be grouped by information (metadata) such as: media service<br>
author, date of copyright, media service date of transmission, performer, title,<br>
subject, parental rating, user rating, director, producer, running length, media<br>
service transmission locator (e.g., radio station, television station, studio, etc),<br>
content aggregator subscription, and language.<br>
[0057]	In Step 714, CPU 214 repeats steps 706-712 for a second<br>
list of media services available from second content aggregator 102. A second<br>
HTTP processor API 404 requests the second list of media services via a Get<br>
Command (step 706). The second content aggregator 102 responds to the Get<br>
command (step 708). The second HTTP processor API 404 collects the list of<br>
media services from second content aggregator 102 and forwards the second list<br>
to content adapter 406 for additional processing (step 710). Content adapter<br>
406 uses the common list data structure to match the media services listed in<br>
the second content list to genres and sub-genres of media types. The contents<br>
of the first and second content list are then indexed into a unified content list,<br>
for example under common music genres as shown in FIG. 5 or other types of<br>
hierarchical listings using metadata attributes, as described above.<br>
[0058]	The unified content list is presented to the user on display<br>
device 222. Each item in the unified content list has a content identifier that<br>
uniquely identifies the content and its source. Content adapter 406 passes this<br>
identifier to CPU 214 when a media service is selected for retrieval. CPU 214<br>
then retrieves and plays back the media service, in accordance with the method<br>
described in FIG. 6 above.<br>
[0059]	An example of merged content selections in the form of a<br>
unified list is displayed in FIG. 5. The genres and the sub-genres of media<br>
services available from the content aggregators are downloaded into data<br>
memory 218, and are manipulated preferably by a subroutine of the XML parser<br>
408. For example, a first content aggregator 102 has a listing of media services<br>
510 grouped by music genres and related sub-genres (e.g., Jazz, a music genre,<br>
has the sub-genres of Brass, Suncoast Sound, and Trios). Second content<br><br>
aggregator 102 has a listing of media services 520 grouped by music genres<br>
with related sub-genres (e.g., Jazz, a music genre, with the sub-genre of Acid<br>
Jazz). XML parser 408 groups the related genres together and into a format<br>
shown in unified content aggregator list 530 (e.g., Jazz has the combined sub-<br>
genres from the two content aggregators being Acid Jazz, Brass, Suncoast<br>
Sound, and Trios). This format is then outputted to display device 222, and the<br>
music services are selected via input device 224 for playback through audio<br>
speaker 220.<br>
[0060]	FIG. 8 describes an exemplary embodiment of the invention<br>
that allows for a device connected on a network to control and receive<br>
secondary media services available through content aggregator 102. The device<br>
connected to the network conforms to a predetermined protocol (e.g., Universal<br>
Plug and Play, IEEE 802.11, BLUETOOTH®, IEEE-1394) permitting the device to<br>
recognize and utilize features of other equipment on the network that conform to<br>
the predetermined protocol. A primary media service is a media service that<br>
natively exists in a device, for example external device 820 (a stereo receiver)<br>
plays audio received as radio waves received through antenna 822 that are<br>
demodulated by tuner 824 for playback through audio speaker 818. A secondary<br>
media service is a media service that originates in other equipment that is<br>
accessed and controlled through a network connection by a device on the<br>
network; for example receiver 820 receives and controls a streaming audio<br>
broadcast (secondary media service) from content aggregator 102 through cable<br>
set top box 204. In this example, the set top box 204 offers the secondary<br>
media services as ContentDirectory 806 services (hardware or software that lists<br>
the available media services) that are indexed and managed through the<br>
operation of the predetermined protocol.<br>
[0061]	Receiver 820 communicates via the predetermined protocol<br>
to set top box 204 through a network or wireless connection. Set top box 204<br>
also connects to content aggregator 102 through communications network 110,<br>
whereby content aggregator 102 has secondary media services (e.g., streaming<br><br>
audio and video, MP3, compact disc music, broadcast video) available.<br>
Preferably, content aggregator 102 communicates to set top box 204 through a<br>
TCP/IP based connection through hardware services module 802. Hardware<br>
services module 802 is a modem or other type of bi-directional communications<br>
device with serial, parallel, Ethernet, or other connecting interface. Hardware<br>
services module 802 also controls the video programming displayed on television<br>
208 connected to set top box 204.<br>
[0062]	Control point 810, a controller (e.g., computer,<br>
microprocessor, or software driver) connected to set top box 204, requests a<br>
listing of media services available from content aggregator 102 through set top<br>
t&gt;ox 204. This request is received by ContentDirectory 806 that in turn issues a<br>
ListContentCall (from step 306) to the stream API 804, as described above in<br>
FIG. 4. Optionally, set top box 204 receives listings of media services from a<br>
plurality of content aggregators 102 preferably as XML or HTML based<br>
documents. The listing of the media services received by stream API 804 is<br>
processed and transferred to the ContentDirectory services 806. Additionally,<br>
the ContentDirectory service 806 formats the listing of media services from XML<br>
in accordance with a predetermined format and indexes the listing for access by<br>
other equipment that conform to the predetermined format.<br>
[0063]	Control point 810 transmits a command to set top box 204<br>
to display the available media services on a display device (television 208). The<br>
control point 810 uses the display services routines of the predetermined<br>
protocol and requests the list of media services from set top box 204. Also, set<br>
top box 204 takes delivery of the request and transfers the listing of media<br>
services residing in the ContentDirectory services 806. Control point 810<br>
receives and formats the media service list as HTML code that is sent to<br>
hardware services 802 that renders the HTML for display on connected<br>
television 208. Preferably, the rendered HTML code is displayed as a<br>
combination of text and graphics that may be used as an electronic programming<br>
guide, as in FIG. 11 described above. Control point 810 is also enabled to control<br><br>
stream API 804 until the media selection is completely received or a user<br>
terminates the play of the selection.<br>
[0067]	Receiver 820 (e.g., an audio receiver) receives the output<br>
signal through AV transport 814 via the connection interface with set top box<br>
204. AV transport 814 forwards the signal to hardware services 816 for<br>
processing. Hardware services 816 then transfers the processed signal to audio<br>
speaker 818 for audio playback. Optionally, the external device has built in tuner<br>
824 that receives RF based radio signals from antenna 822. Tuner 824<br>
demodulates and decodes radio signals for playback on the connected audio<br>
speaker 818. The external device automatically interrupts the playback of tuner<br>
824 when hardware services 816 receives and outputs the processed signal. The<br>
playback of the radio signals received through tuner 324 is resumed when the<br>
selected media service is terminated or completed.<br>
[0068]	In accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br>
forms of other delivery systems delivering media services available from content<br>
aggregators may benefit from the present invention. For example, a satellite<br>
radio broadcast with multiple media services available may have its selections<br>
combined with the available media services through a set top box cable<br>
interface, to form a unified listing of media services.<br><br>
and transmit other services 808 such as additional media services, or Internet<br>
based material that does not come from content aggregator 102, such as an<br>
electronic program guide, electronic mail, and purchasing a selected media<br>
service (as a CD or cassette tape) through an online store via user selection<br>
device 826.<br>
[0064]	From television 208, a media service is selected from the<br>
listing of media services via user selection device 826 that transmits signals to<br>
control point 810. Preferably, user selection device 826 is remote control that<br>
uses a wire or wireless interface to communicate with control point 810,<br>
whereby television 208 displays the listing of the media services by a use of a<br>
directional pad, buttons, or knob on user selection device 826. Once a media<br>
service is selected with user selection device 826, control point 810 formats and<br>
sends a request for the media service to a content aggregator 102 via hardware<br>
services module 802 and communications network 110.<br>
[0065]	Content aggregator 102 receives the request for the media<br>
service and after processing the request, transmits data comprising the media<br>
service to hardware services 802 through communications network 110.<br>
Hardware services 802 receives data that transferred to stream API 804 that<br>
formats the data of the media service to an internal format utilized by set top<br>
box 204.<br>
[0066]	Control point 810 coordinates the outputting of the data<br>
comprising the media service by transmitting a request to AV transport 812 to<br>
output the media service to receiver 820. Preferably, AV transport 812<br>
comprises a connection interface to an external device (as receiver 820).<br>
Optionally, AV transport 812 comprises software that controls the transmission<br>
of data (forming the media service) residing in buffers of the stream API 804. AV<br>
transport 812 receives (from the stream API 804) and formats the data<br>
comprising the media service (into predetermined signal format for output to the<br>
receiver 820. The signal is outputted through the connection of the AV transport<br>
812 to receiver 820. AV transport 812 continuously queues the buffers of<br><br>
