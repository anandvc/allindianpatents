DEEPBREEZE LTD. an Israel company, of 15 Bareket Street Industrial Park, 38900 Caesarea, Israel<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO2004/10S612<br>
                                                                            2	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ANALYZING CARDIOVASCULAR SOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to medical devices and methods, and more particularly to such devices and methods for analyzing body sounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	Body sounds are routinely used by physicians in the diagnosis of various<br>
disorders. A physician may place a stethoscope on a person's chest or back and monitor the patient's breathing or heartbeat in order to detect adventitious (i.e. abnormal or unexpected) lung or heartsounds. The identification and classification of adventitious lung or heart sounds often provides important information about<br>
10  pulmonary or cardiac abnormalities.<br>
It is also known to fix one or more microphones onto a subject's chest or back and to record lung sounds. U.S. Patent No. 6,139,505 discloses a system in which a plurality of microphones are placed around a patient's chest. The recordings of the microphones during inhalation and expiration are displayed on a<br>
15 screen, or printed on paper. The recordings are then visually examined by a physician in order to detect a pulmonary disorder in the patent. Kompis et al (Chest, 120(4), 2001) disclose a system in which M microphones are placed on a patient's chest, and lung sounds are recorded. The recordings generate M linear equations that are solved using a least-squares fit The solution of the system is<br>
20   used to determine the location in the lungs of the source of a sound detected in the. recordings. .<br><br>

U.S. Patent 5,285,788 discloses an ultrasound tissue imaging system having an acoustic transducer, and imaging means for producing an image of tissue. The system also includes Doppler imaging means to produce a scanned acoustic image of moving tissue that is displayed superimposed on the ultrasound image.<br>
5   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following description and set of claims, two explicitly described, calculable, or measurable variables are considered equivalent to each other when the two variables are proportional to one another.<br>
The present invention provides, in one of its embodiments, a system and 10 method for recording and analyzing cardiovascular sounds produced in the cardiovascular system. The system includes a plurality of N transducers (microphones) configured to be attached to an essentially planar region R of the individual's back or chest over the individual's thorax. Positions in the region R are indicated by two-dimensional position vectors x^x^x2) in a two-dimensional 15 coordinate system defined in the planar region R The ith transducer, for i=l to N, is fixed at a position x,- in the region R and generates a signal, denoted herein by P(xist) indicative of pressure waves in the body arriving at xt.<br>
The transducers are typically embedded in a matrix that permits to affix<br>
      them easily onto the individual's skin. Such a matrix may typically be in the form<br>
20   of a vest or garment for easily placing over the individual's thorax. As may be<br>
appreciated, different matrices may be used for differently sized individuals, for<br>
different ages, sexes, etc.<br>
The N signals P(xh t) are processed by signal processing circuitry. In accordance with the invention, the signals are filtered so as to remove one or more 25 components of the signals not arising from cardiovascular sounds (e.g. respiratory . tract signals). Cardiovascular sounds are typically in the range of 6 to 45 Hz, while respiratory tract sounds are typically in the range of 100 to 400 Hz. Thus, respiratory sounds may be removed from the signals by filtering the signals, for example, with a band pass filter passing between 15 to 45 Hz.<br><br>
WO 2004/105612	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
4<br>
The N filtered signals (also indicated herein by P(XC,-, t) may be processed<br>
in order to diagnose the state of the individual's cardiovascular system. This may<br>
be via an automatic differential diagnosis in which the results of the processing<br>
are compared to functions or parameters previously stored in a database that are<br>
5  known to be indicative of various disorders in the body region.<br>
■    _	■	'	i<br>
The filtered signals may also be processed to generate an image of the<br>
individual's cardiovascular system. The results of this processing are displayed<br>
on a display device, for example using a gray level scale, as demonstrated in the<br>
examples below. In the image, anatomic features of the heart such as the atria,<br>
10  ventricles, septal walls, can be observed. The image may be visually or<br>
automatically analyzed for the detection of a disorder in the cardiovascular<br>
system similar to the analysis of images obtained by other imaging methods such<br>
as X-ray (scintigraphy) or ultrasound imaging (echocardiography).<br>
A region or regions of the heart or cardiovascular system in a displayed 15 image that are suspected of including a pathological condition, may de identified in the image, and this may be in a number of ways, for example, by different colors, by different patterns, by way of a written text, and many other ways. The term "pathological condition" refers to any deviation from the normal, healthy condition of the cardiovascular system. This includes murmurs and other hemodynamic 20 irregularities, cardiac effusion, narrowing of blood vessel, and other space containing lesions in the cardiovascular system, etc.<br>
Additionally, a time interval can be divided into a plurality of sub intervals, and each subinterval processed separately. An image of the cardiovascular system for each of these subintervals may then be determined and displayed 25 sequentially on the display device. This generates a movie showing dynamic changes occurring in the cardiovascular system over the time interval. This allows viewing of the systoles and diastoles of the different parts of the heart during the heartbeat.<br><br>

5<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the processing involves determining from the N signals an average acoustic energy arising from cardiovascular sounds, denoted herein by P(x,h,t2), at at least one position x in the region R over a time interval from ^ to t2. The term "acoustic energy" at a location is used herein to refer to a 5 parameter indicative of or approximating the product of the pressure and the mass propagation velocity at that location.<br>
In one embodiment, an average acoustic energy over a time interval from tj to t2 is obtained at a position of one of the microphones using the algebraic expression<br>
10	<br><br>
where xt is the position of the microphone.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the processing involves obtaining an<br>
average acoustic energy P(xnt„t2) over a time interval from t1 to t2 at a plurality of<br>
        positions x( of the microphones, for example using Equation (1), and then<br>
15   calculating P(x, h, ti) at other locations x by interpolation of the P (x,, ti, t2) using<br>
any known interpolation method.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the interpolation is performed to obtain an average acoustic energy P{x,tltt2) at a position x = (x\x2) in the surface R using the algebraic expression:<br>
20		(2)<br>
where g(x, xt, a) is a kernel satisfying<br>
	(3)<br><br>
	(4)<br>
and where x, =(x],x2)is the position of the ith microphone and  a selectable <br>
25   parameter.<br><br>

PCT/1L2004/000462<br><br><br><br><br>
The system may optionally contain a display device for displaying the 5 function P. The function P may be displayed on the display, for example using a gray level scale, as demonstrated in the examples below. A two dimensional graphical representation of the function P produces an image of the cardiovascular system. In the image anatomic features of the heart such as the atria, ventricles, septal walls, can be observed. The image may be analyzed for <br>
10    the detection of a disorder in the cardiovascular system similar to the analysis of images obtained by other imaging methods such as X-ray (scintigraphy) or ultrasound imaging (echocardiography).<br>
A region or regions of the heart or cardiovascular system in a displayed image that are suspected of including a pathological condition, may de identified in<br>
15   the image, and this may be in a number of ways, for example, by different colors, by different patterns, by way of a written text, and many other ways. The term "pathological condition" refers to any deviation from the normal, healthy condition of the cardiovascular system. This includes murmurs and other hemodynamic irregularities, cardiac effusion, narrowing of blood vessel, and other space<br>
20  containing lesions in the cardiovascular system, etc.<br>
Additionally, a time interval can be divided into a plurality of sub intervals, and an average acoustic energy P determined over the region R for two or more of the sub intervals. An image of P for each of these sub intervals may then be determined and displayed sequentially on the display device. This generates a<br>
25 movie showing dynamic changes occurring in the acoustic energy in the body region, over the time interval. For example, transducers may be placed on a person's chest or back and an average acoustic energy P determined in accordance<br><br>
WO 2004/105612	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
	7<br>
with the invention for a plurality of sub intervals over one or more heartbeats. An image can be obtained for each of these sub intervals and displayed sequentially so as to generate a movie showing changes in the acoustic energy of the heart over the heartbeat. This allows viewing of the systoles and diastoles of the different parts of 5   the hear during the heartbeat<br>
The signals P(xt,t)may also be subjected to additional analysis to detect<br>
abnormal heart sounds.<br>
The present invention also provides a program storage device readable by<br>
machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine<br>
10   to perform method steps for determining for at least one time interval, an average<br>
acoustic energy function P arising from cardiovascular sounds using an algorithm<br>
involving at least one signal P(xi,t) indicative of pressure waves at a location x, on<br>
a body surface.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a system generally indicated by 100 for analyzing body sounds 5 in a three-dimensional region of an individual's body in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. A plurality of N sound transducers 105, of which four are shown, are applied to a planar region of the chest or back skin of individual 110. The transducers 105 may be any type of sound transducer, such as a microphone or a Doppler shift detector. The transducers 105 may be applied to the<br>
10 subject by any means known in the art, for example using an adhesive, suction, or fastening straps. Each transducer 105 produces an analog voltage signal 115 indicative of pressure waves arriving to the transducer. The analog signals 115 are digitized by a multichannel analog to digital converter 120. The digital data signals P(xat) 125, represent the pressure wave at the location xt of the ith transducer (i= 1<br>
15 to N) at time t The data signals 125 are input to a memory 130. Data input to the memory 130 are accessed by a processor 135 configured to process the data signals 125. The signals 125 may be denoised by filtering components having frequencies outside of the range of body sounds in the body region, for example, vibrations due to movement of the individual. Each signal 125 may also be subject to band pass<br>
20 filtering so that only components in the signal within the range of cardiovascular sounds are analyzed. The signal may be divided into frequency bands, and each band analyzed separately.<br>
An input device such as a computer keyboard 140 or mouse 145 is used to input relevant information relating to the examination such as personal details of<br>
25  the individual 110. The input device 140 may also be used to input values of the times t1 and t2. Alternatively, the times t1 and t2 may be determined automatically in a respiratory phase analysis of the signals P{x„i) performed by the processor<br>
135. The processor 135 determines an average acoustic energy P(x,ti,t2)av&amp; the<br><br>
WO 2004/105612<br>
                                                                                    11	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
time interval from t1 to t2 at least one locations in the region R in a calculation involving at least one of the signals P(x, ,t).<br>
The average acoustic energies are stored in the memory 130 and may be displayed on a display device 150 such as a CRT screen for diagnosis by a 5   physician.<br>
The processor 135 may also perform an automatic differential diagnosis by comparing the function P to functions stored in the memory and known to be indicative of various disorders in the body region.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow chart diagram for carrying out the method of the 10 invention in accordance with one embodiment. In step 200 the signals P(xi,t) are obtained from N transducers placed at predetermined locations xt for i from 1 to N in a region R on the body surface. In step 205 values of t1 and t2 are either input to the processor 135 using the input devices 140 or 145, or are determined by the processor. In step 210, an average acoustic energy (x,t1t2) is determined at least 15 one location x in the region R over the time interval t1 to r2. In step 220 the average acoustic energy is displayed on the display 150 for at least one value of x. In step 230, it is determined whether a function P is to be determined over another time interval. If yes, the process returns to step 205. If not, the process terminates.<br>
It will also be understood that the system according to. the invention may be 20 a suitably programmed computer. Likewise, the invention contemplates a computer program being readable by a computer for executing the method of the invention. The invention further contemplates a machine-readable memory tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine for executing the method of the invention.<br>
25	'<br>
Examples<br>
The  system  and  method  of the  invention were  used  to  analyze cardiovascular sounds in an individual. Example 1<br><br><br>
WO 2004/105612	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
Fig. 3 shows recording of signals over one heartbeat in an individual. A two-dimensional coordinate system was defined on the individual’s back. As shown in Fig. 3,48 transducers were placed on the individual's back over the thorax, at the locations indicated by the circles 300. The curves 305 show the presumed contours<br>
5 of the lungs, and the curve 306 shows the presumed contour of the heart. As can be seen, the transducers were arranged in a regular orthogonal lattice with spacing between the transducers in the horizontal and vertical directions of 2.5 cm. The signals P(xt,t) from each transducer were then recorded over one heartbeat. Each signal was filtered using a 6-45 Hz band pass filter, in order to remove respiratory<br>
10 tract sounds. The heartbeat was divided into intervals of 0.1 sec duration, and for each interval, P(x,ti,tz) was obtained using Equations (1) and (2) above with the kernel g of Equation (5) with o=36 pixels. Fig. 4 shows the images obtained by representing the obtained functions P(x,ti,t2)by gray level shading. The images may be displayed on the display device 150 in rapid succession so as to produce a<br>
15 movie of the heart over a heartbeat. The movie can be analyzed to determine the values of basic parameters of heart function, such as left ventricular end diastolic (LVED) volume, left ventricular end systolic (LVES) volume, right ventricular end diastolic (RVED) volume, right ventricular end systolic (RVES), volume, left atrium end diastolic (LAED) diameter, right atrium end diastolic (LAES) diameter,<br>
20 wall thickness of the inter-ventricular septum (systolic and diastolic), and parameters derivable from these parameters such as left ventricle stroke volume, left ventricular cardiac output, ejection fraction, left, ventricular fractional shortening, inter-ventricular septal thickening. The. movie can also be analyzed in order to detect heart defects such as valve dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmia.<br>
25	Example 2<br>
The signals P(xi,t) were obtained from each transducer as described in Example 1, and were then recorded over one respiratory cycle which includes about 5 heartbeats. Each signal was divided into two sub-signals P1(xat) and Pfat) of different frequency bands. The sub-signal P](xbf) was obtained by filtering the<br><br>
WO 2004/105612	PCT/1L2004/000462<br>
13<br>
signal using a 6-40 Hz band pass filter. The sub-signal P2(xbt) was obtained by filtering the signal using a 100-150 band pass filter. The sub-signal Pjfat) consists primarily of heart sounds, while the sub-signal Pfa»t) consists primarily of lung sounds. The P;(x*0 sub-signal was analyzed by the method of the invention, and<br>
