CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]      This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 09/325,325, filed June 3, 1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]      The present invention generally relates to apparatus, systems  and  methods  for  processing  and  treating  biological fluids, such as blood and blood components.  More particularly, the present invention relates to such apparatus,  systems and methods  having  a  light  sensing  system  to  measure  the illumination intensity of a plurality of lamps,  a radiometer with a plurality of light sensors that may be inserted into the apparatus to calibrate the light sensing system, an interface printed circuit board that interfaces a computer printed circuit board  with  the electronics  and sensors  of  the apparatus,  a sensor arrangement  to detect  the motion  of  an agitator  for agitating the biological fluid, methods for calibrating, sensing and correcting light  intensity measurements,  a  radiometer for accurately  measuring  light  in  the  apparatus  to  provide  a reference for calibrating the light sensing system, and methods for  determining  the  length  of  treatment  to  reach  a  desired illumination dose by using the calibrated light sensing system. [0003]      Apparatus,   methods   and   systems   for   treating biological  fluids,  such as  blood  and  blood  components,  with light are well known.   For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,952,812, incorporated by reference herein,  discloses an apparatus  for treating unwanted white blood cells in platelet concentrate with ultraviolet' radiation to limit  the ability of  white cells  to trigger an immune reaction in a patient.  To treat containers of platelet concentrate,  the containers are placed on a slidable drawer that is introduced into a housing between facing arrays of  Lamps  for  irradiation  from both  sides  of  the  container. During irradiation, the drawer (or a portion of the drawer) may<br><br>
be  pivoted  in  a  rocking  motion  to  agitate  the  platelet concentrate.<br>
[0004]      U.S.  Patent  No.  5,557,098,  also  incorporated  by reference herein, discloses a system and apparatus for treating a biological fluid with light for the purpose of inactivating pathogens  that  may be  present  in  the 'biological  fluid.    A slidable drawer is used to position the containers of biological fluid between facing arrays of light emitting diodes.   Extended flaps on the containers,  located outside the light field,  are automatically punched to indicate different stages of nhe light t reatment.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 6,245,570, which is also incorporated by reference herein, discloses apparatus and methods for treating a container of a blood product between two facing arrays of light. The container includes a light sensitive tape that changes color when exposed to ultraviolet light, thereby indicating when the treatment process is complete.<br>
[0006]      Still  other  apparatus  and  systems  for  treating biological  fluid are disclosed in U.S.  Patent  No.  4,726,949, U.S.  Patent No.  5,709,991,  U.S.  Patent No.  6,433,343 and U.S. Patent No. 6,190,609, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0007]      Prior  art   radiometers   typically  measure  light intensity at a single point and from only one direction. [0008]      While the prior art apparatus,  systems and methods have  generally  worked  satisfactorily,  there  is  a  need  for improved  apparatus,  systems  and  methods  that  provide,  for example, improved reliability and accuracy, greater flexibility and efficiency, improved' ease of use and serviceability, as well as enhanced tracking, record keeping and the like.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00062] For purposes of illustration, the various aspects of the present invention will be described, in large part, in connection with their preferred embodiments. However, it should be recognized chat the apparatus, systems and methods embodying the different aspects of the present invention are not limited to the specific details described herein.<br>
[00063]     An  apparatus  for  treating  a  biological  fluid  is generally  shown  in  Figs.  1-14  and  is  referred  to  herein generally as  light  box  10.    Light  box  10 may be  used  for treating a variety of materials for a variety of purposes. [00064]     Light box 10 is particularly useful in the treatment of biological fluids.   As used herein, biological fluid refers to any fluid that is found in or that may be introduced into the body including,  but not limited to,  blood and blood products. As  used  herein  "blood  product"  refers  to  whole  blood  or  a component of whole blood such as red blood cells,  white blood cells, platelets, plasma or a combination of one or more of such components that have been separated from whole blood. [00065]     One specific, non-limiting use of light box 10 is in<br><br>
the treatment of a blood product that has been combined with a photochemical  agent  for activation when  subjected  to  light. such  photochemical  agents  are  used,  for  example,  in  the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, white blood cells and other contaminants  (collectively referred to herein as "pathogens") . In  pathogen  inactivation  applications,  the  activated  agent inactivates pathogens that may be present in a blood product. [00066]     Typically,  the biological  fluid to  be treated is introduced into a fluid treatment chamber within light box 10 in flexible,   plastic,   sterilizable,   translucent,   biologically compatible  container's.    In  accordance  with  aspects  of  the present invention, the containers may be integrally connected to other containers and plastic tubing useful in the processing of the;  biological  fluid  both  before  and  after  the  treatment provided by light box 10.  Examples of the disposable processing set and its components are shown in Figs. 15-18.  The light box, the1 disposable processing set and the methods of using them are described in more detail below.<br>
a. Light Box [00067]     As shown in Fig. 1, light box 10 includes a housing<br>
12	defined by top panel  14,  bottom panel  16,  front and rear<br>
panels 17, and side panels 18.  Housing 12 is supported by feet<br>
13	attached  to  bottom  panel  16  (Fig.  4) .    In  a  preferred<br>
embodiment, feet 13 are rubber or other elastomeric mounts. Side<br>
panels 18 may include handles 22 for grasping and transporting<br>
light box 10.  An openable or removable door 24 in side panel 18<br>
allows for access to the interior of  light box 10 and,  more<br>
specifically,  the electronic components of light box 10, which<br>
are described in more detail below.   Door 24 may be opened .or<br>
removed by turning fasteners 25.<br>
[00068] For convenience and efficiency, it is preferred that light box 10 be fairly compact. In one, non-limiting example, light box 10 may be approximately 100-120 cm wide, 20-100 cm deep and between approximately 30--40 cm high. A compact instrument allows, for example, for placement of a greater number of instruments per treatment center and/or may allow two<br><br>
or more instruments to be stacked on top of each other (as shown in Fig. 13), resulting in greater throughput of biological fluid per horizontal area or space (i.e. bench space, shelf space or t he like) .<br>
[00069] Light box 10 may include a control module 26 and a fluid treatment module 28. As described in more detail below, control module 26 may include and/or house the command and control elements for the treatment of biological fluid. Fluid treatment module 28 houses the elements and components where fluid processing takes place.<br>
[00070]     Control module 26 and fluid treatment module 28 may be contained in the same housing but in a preferred embodiment, as shown in Fig. 2, they are readily separable modules. Control module 26 and fluid treatment module 28 are electrically and physically connected when light box 10 is in use, but may be separated as shown in Fig. 2.  In one embodiment, control module 26 and fluid treatment module 28 are held together, in part, by a draw pin 30 (Fig. 4), which holds together interfitting parts of the modules.   Alternatively, modules 26 and 28 may be held together by captive fasteners 31 (also shown in FIG. 4) with or without  draw pin 30.   -Control module 26  and fluid treatment module  28  may  be  separated  by  removing  draw  pin  30  and/or turning of fasteners 31 shown in Fig. 4.   Fasteners 31 may be accessed by removing door 24 (shown in Fig. 1) in side panel 18. Of  course,  other means of  connecting  and  readily separating control  and  fluid  treatment  modules  may  be  used,  including, mating clips and slots on the facing panels of the control 26 and fluid treatment module 28.<br>
[00071]     Providing  light  box  10  in  two  readily  separable modules 26 and 28 allows for easier access to the control and fluid treatment modules 26 and 28 and. generally, provides for easier serviceability of light box 10.  For example, if off-site service is required for control module 26 only, that module can be removed without requiring removal and transport of the entire light box 10. [00072]     As shown in Figs. 1 and "2, the exterior of control<br>
module 26 includes a control panel 32 located in the front of light box 10-   Control panel 32 includes, a display screen 37 such  as,  but not  limited  to,  an LCD display  for providing graphical,   textual  and  alphanumerical  information  to  the operator regarding the treatment process.  Also included within control panel 32 of control module 26 is a key pad 39 to allow operator control over the process and/or for data entry by the operator.  A different keypad 39a is shown in Fig. 29, which is a four-by-four matrix with 10 numerical digits and the * and # functions, such as the keypads typically provided on telephones. Additional means of data entry are provided by bar code reader scanner 41 which, when not in use, rests in slot 43 or' a scanner holder.  A trough 45 may be provided for the coiled cable of bar code  reader  41.    Alternatively,  coiled  cable  of  bar  code reader/scanner 41 may be routed through the rear of scanner holder 43.   Control panel may also include the on/off switch 35 for light box 10.  .<br>
[00073]     The  interior  components  of  control  module  26  are generally shown in Fig.  4.   Control module 26 will typically include a programmable microprocessor for operation of light box 10 including central processing unit 27 and memory devices such as random access memory (RAM) and EPROMS for the system program storage  and  non-volatile  memory  for  back-up  data  storage. Control module 26 may further include an isolation' transformer 29 for converting an AC input voltage to a DC control system voltage and for maintaining leakage current within acceptable limits  for  medical  devices.   Other components within control module 26 may include power supply 167,  input/output board 33 and a power inlet module 34, filtered pass through 34b for use with an external  light  intensity sensing device and filtered output pass through  34a.<br>
[00074]     Control module 26 may be adapted for connection to<br>
external components such as a printer 500  (Fig.  14}  through<br>
parallel and/or serial.ports 612, 613 and/or 616 (Fig. 33)  (such<br>
as to a label printer through a serial port) , or to a computer<br>
printed circuit board (PCB) 602 or, for example, to an Ethernet<br><br>
port 621.    Computer; PCB 602 can receive data from Che several instruments,  allowing  the operator at  a  treatment  center to retrieve information regarding the several procedures.  As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill, control module 26 may also include other components such as additional printed circuit boards  shown  in Fig.  33.     While  Fig.  14  illustrates  one embodiment of an electronic control system to light box 10, the preferred embodiment is illustrated in Figs.  33-35,  which are discussed in detail below.<br>
[00075]     Turning now to the  fluid  treatment  module 28,  as shown in Figs.  1-3,  fluid treatment module 28  includes front door 36 which when opened, allows for introduction and removal of  the  biological  fluid  into a fluid  treatment  chamber,  as described in more detail below.  The front panel 17 of fluid treatment module 28  may also be opened to allow for fuller access to the interior of fluid treatment module. As shown in Fig.  3,  panel  17 may include fasteners  17a and ball detents which,  when  turned,  allow  front  panel  17  to  be .opened  or removed.<br>
[00076]     Figs. 4 and 5 generally show the interior of fluid treatment module 28 with at least top panel .14 and front panel 17removed.  As best seen in Fig. 5,  fluid treatment module 28 includes an interior framework 38 that defines, in part, a fluid treatment chamber 40 and light chambers 42 and 44  for housing light sources  (described in more detail below).   The framework 38  may typically be constructed of any sturdy material which will allow light box 10 to support one or more additional light boxes as generally shown in Fig. 13.   A preferred material is aluminum and,  in particular,  Aluminum 6061 hardened to T-6 or Aluminum 5052/H32.<br>
[00077] Returning to Fig. 5, the light chambers 42 and 44 are located above and below fluid treatment chamber 40 to provide two sided illumination of the biological fluid. Of course, it will be appreciated that light box 10 may include a single light chamber, placed in close proximity to fluid treatment chamber or two or more light chambers disposed around a fluid treatment<br>
chamber in other than "top and bottom" positions.<br>
[00078]     As  shown  in  Figs.  3  through  5,  fluid  treatment chamber 40  is  adapted to receive  fluid carrying drawer 50. Light chambers 42 and 44 are adapted to receive light drawers 60 and  70.  Fluid  treatment  module  28  may,  optionally,  further include a container marker assembly 74 shown,  for example,  in Fig. 5.  Marker assembly 74 may carry one or more markers 76a-76d for marking containers, before and/or after treatment, as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[00079]     Turning more specifically to a description of fluid<br>
carrying drawer 50, as shown in Fig. 13, fluid carrying drawer<br>
50  allows  for  introduction  of  biological  fluid  into  fluid<br>
treatment chamber 40.  Fluid carrying drawer 50 may be moveable,<br>
either  manually  or  automatically,   into  and  out  of  fluid<br>
treatment chamber 40.  Where manual movement of fluid carrying<br>
drawer 50 is required, drawer 40 may include handle 80.   In one<br>
embodiment, movement of fluid carrying drawer 50 is facilitated<br>
by slides 82 on either or both sides of drawer 50,  which are<br>
disposed, within rails 86 of framework 38, as best seen in Figs.<br>
8,  9  and  13.    Alternatively,  fluid  carrying  drawer  50 may<br>
include  rollers or other devices that  allow for movement of<br>
drawer 50 into and out of fluid treatment chamber 40.<br>
[00080]     For  ease  of  loading  and  unloading  containers  of<br>
biological fluid, fluid carrying drawer 50 preferably includes a<br>
pivot mount that permits the drawer to be tilted downwardly when<br>
fully withdrawn. The ability to tilt drawer 50 downwardly may be<br>
pa fticular1y useful for loading containers of fluid in the upper<br>
light boxes where two or more light boxes are stacked on top of<br>
each  other,  as  shown  in  Fig.  13.  In  one  embodiment,  fluid<br>
carrying drawer 50 may be hingedly attached to framework 38 so<br>
that:  when  fluid  carrying  drawer  50  is  fully  opened  and  is<br>
outside of housing 12,  front edge of drawer 50 may be tilted<br>
downwardly at,  for example, a 20-45° angle, and preferably a 30°<br>
ang1e .	.<br>
[00081]     To allow tilting of fluid carrying drawer, light box 10 may include spring loaded tilt knob 83 which,  when pulled,<br>
releases fluid carrying drawer 50 and allows it to be tilted in the manner described above.  More specifically, as shown in Fig. 8A, tilt knob 83 is connected to rod 82a which is attached to slide 82  (Fig.  9).   The end of rod 82a  is coupled to pivot member 83a, which is connected to ring 83b attached to drawer 50.  Rod 82a further includes a spring 82c and spring stops 82d. When the end of rod 82a is coupled to pivot member 83a, movement or ring 83b is prevented (as shown in Fig. 8A) .   However, when knob 83 is pulled,  (as shown in Fig. 8B)  rod 82a is uncoupled fiom pivot member 83a, allowing ring to rotate relative to pivot member  83a  and,  thereby,  allowing  drawer  50  to  be  tilted downwardly, as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[00082]     Alternatively,  light box 10 and more specifically, fluid-carrying drawer 50, may include release button 300 which, when pressed,  allows drawer 50 to be downwardly tilted in the manner shown in Figs.  26-28.   As shown in Figs.  27-2.8, button 300 actuates rod 302, which is attached to bell crank 304.   As rod 302 is moved forward, bell crank 304 pivots around cylinder 306..   The pivoting of bell  crank 304 pulls rod 308,  thereby disengaging  latch  pawl  310  from  its  fixed  position on  the internal framework of light box 10 (not shown) .  With larch pawl 310  disengaged,   f luid-carrying  drawer   50  may  be  tilted downwardly  for   ease  of   loading  of  the  biological  fluid containers as generally shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[00083]     Returning to Figs. 8-9,  fluid carrying drawer 50 is generally open and includes a central cavity 88  to allow for placement  of  a  container-carrying  tray  90  shown  in  Fig.  7. Container carrying tray 90 may be integral with fluid carrying drawer 50,  although, a removable non- integrated tray 90 may be preferable for easier container loading and/or tray cleaning. [00084]     During treatment of the biological fluid,  it may be desirable  that  the  fluid within fluid  carrying drawer 50  be continuously or periodically agitated to provide mixing of the biological  fluid  and  ensure^ chat  substantially  all  of  the biological fluid is sufficiently and uniformly exposed to light and/or  any photochemical  agent.   Accordingly,  fluid carrying<br>
drawer 50 may be attached to means for agitating the biological fluid.<br>
[00085]     As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, fluid carrying drawer 50 may include an agitation assembly that,  for example,  provides side-to side oscillation of  tray 90.  Agitation assembly may include a pair of fixed lower rails 95b that extend front to back within light chamber.  Upper rails 95a are attached to the lower rails by pivotally attached link arms 93a and 93b.   The link arms allow side-to-side motion of the upper rails 95a.  To provide oscillation, an electrical motor 92 is attached to lower rail 95b.   Motor 92 rotates a cam 97a.   Cam 97a may be an L-shaped crank or bracket attached to roller 97.   Roller 97 is captured between parallel walls 97b depending from upper rail 95a.  As crank 97a causes roller 97 to orbit around the motor 92 axis, roller slides fore and aft and up and down between walls 97b, imparting side-to-side motion of upper rail 95a. [00086]     Alternatively,  as shown  in Fig.  24,  the agitation assembly may include I-shaped legs 320.   As shown in Fig. 24, the bottom flared portions of legs 320 are affixed to lower rods 322  which  are,  in  turn,  affixed  to the  floor  of  the  fluid treatment module 26.   The top flared portions of legs 320 are fixed to plate 324, which receives fluid- carrying drawer 50 (and tray 90), as shown in Fig. 24.<br>
[00087] Yoke 326 is fixed to and depends from one side of plate 324. Yoke 326 includes a gap 328 that receives roller 330 of motor 334. As shown in Fig. 25, motor 334 includes a central shaft 336, which receives a cam 338. Cam 338 may be an L-shaped crank or bracket. Shaft 340 of cam 338 receives roller 330. As shown in Fig. 25, roller 330 is offset from shaft 336 by a predetermined distance.<br>
[00088] As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, rotation of cam 338 causes an eccentric motion and movement of roller 330. Specifically, roller 330 slides fore and aft and up and down and moves yoke 326 accordingly, resulting in side-to-side movement of fluid-carrying tray 90. [00089] In one embodiment, roller 330 is offset from shaft<br>
336 by a distance of anywhere between 0.5 and 1 inch and, more preferably, 0.75 inches.   This results in a total displacement of fluid-carrying tray 90 of approximately 1.5 inches. [00090]     Light box 10 may include one or more light sources, preferably disposed above and below fluid treatment chamber 50. For ease of serviceability,  such as  lamp replacement,  it  is preferable that the light source(s) be readily accessible.   As used herein, "readily accessible" means that access to the light source can be quickly and easily had without the use of,  for example,  a screwdriver or other tools.   For example,  in one embodiment, it may be desirable that the light source be either partially or completely removable from the housing 12 and/or fluid  treatment  module  28.    The  light  source(s)  may  be accessible through any one of the front,  side,  top or bottom panels.   In one embodiment,  the light sources  are housed in light drawers 60 and 70.  As shown in Fig. 5, when front panel 17 and/or door 36 are removed or opened,  light drawers may be moveable  (or even completely removable)  into and out of fluid treatment module 28.  Light drawers 60 and 70 may include slides 99 (Fig. 6) attached to the bottom surface of drawers 60 and 70. Slides 99 rest and move on brackets 96 and slide mounting blocks 98 of framework 38 as shown in Fig. 5.  Light drawers 60 and 70 may also .include handles 84  for grasping during  insertion and remova 1 .<br>
[00091]     As shown in Figs. 6, light drawer 60 and/or 70 may be divided  into  two  or more  chambers  101  and  103  separated by dividing wall 102.   Dividing wall 102 minimizes  light from one light chamber of radiating into the other light  chamber.  This ensures that the light emitted from each lamp or lamp array and contacting the biological fluid is substantially constant.   In addition, each of the lamp arrays within light chambers 101 and 103 may be independently monitored and controlled from control module 26.   Thus,  when one array of lamps is . turned off,  the other array of .lamps may remain on.  As described in more detail below,  this  may  be  particularly  useful  where  two  or  more containers  of biological  fluid requiring  different  levels of<br>
treatment are being treated.<br>
[00092]     Each of light chambers 101 and 103 of light drawer 60 or 10 is generally defined by four sidewalls  105 a-d and a bottom wall 107.  Walls 105 a-d and 107 may be made of or coated with a  reflective material  to maximize  the amount of  light delivered, to the biological fluid.   In one specific embodiment, where the light source provides light in the ultraviolet A (UVA) range, walls 105 a-d and 107 may be made of a highly reflective aluminum to provide substantial reflection of UVA light.  Such a  material is sold under the name 1500 G-2 and is available from ALANOD of Ennepetal, Germany.<br>
[00093]     The light sources suitable for use in the present invention may  include  any  light  source  that  is  capable  of providing light  of a particular wavelength and intensity for treating a particular biological  fluid.   For  example,  light sources capable of providing white light,  red light,  infrared, ultraviolet A and/or B light may be used.  Light drawers 60 and 70 may include a single lamp or an array of multiple lamps 100. In one embodiment, light source may include standard fluorescent lamps or bulbs capable of providing light of a wavelength in the UVA  (ultraviolet A)  range.   Such lamps   may be obtained from Sanko Denki of Japan under Che product code BL352 . Light drawers 60 and 70 may further, optionally, include fans 109 for cooling lamps 100 and, more specifically, ends of lamps 100 at or near the lamp filaments.<br>
[00094] As shown in Fig. 6, the ends of lamps 100 are inserted into sockets 104 housed on socket panel 106. Socket pane;! may also serve as a printed circuit board. Socket panel 106 may be hinged and openable to allow for easy access to lamps 100, easy insertion and removal of lamps 100, and in general, easier serviceability of light drawers 60 and 70.<br>
[00095] As shown in Fig. 5, a portion of fluid treatment chamber 40 and, for that matter, fluid carrying drawer 50, are separated from light drawers 60 and 70 by glass plates 110. As shown in Fig. 5, upper glass plate 110 rests on framework 38 and is, generally, held in place by clamps 112 and 114. A lower<br>
glass plate 110 separating a portion of fluid carrying drawer 50 from lower light drawer 70 may also be included.   Glass plates 110 are substantially translucent to light of the wavelengths' used for the treatment of biological fluid.   Preferably, glass plates 110 may also filter unwanted light.   Alternatively,  a separate filter may be provided for placement between the light source and the  fluid treatment chamber 40.   In one specific embodiment, where treatment of a biological fluid with UVA light i.s desired, glass plate 110 may be substantially translucent to ultraviolet  light  within  the  range  to  320-400  nm,  but  not translucent to light of a wavelength of less than about 320 nm. Such glass plates are commercially available from Schott Glass of Yonkers, New York under the product designation B-270. [00096]     As set forth above,  fluid treatment module 28 may optionally further include marker assembly 74.  Marker assembly 74  may  include  one  or  more  markers  76a-76d  for  marking containers within fluid treatment chamber.  One or more markers 76 may be provided to mark containers at different stages of the treatment.  Markers 76a-d may be punches for punching holes into a  portion  of  the  container  such  as  the  container  flap  as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,557,098, which is incorporated by reference.   Alternatively,  and more preferably,  markers may be stampers for stamping designated portions of a container with ink.   Such markers are commercially available  from Trodat  of We 1s, Austria under the product name Printy 4911.<br>
[00097]     As shown in Fig. 11, marker assembly 74 may include a plurality  of  markers  76  a-d  for  marking  a  plurality  of containers  during  different  stages  of  the  light  treatment. Markers 76 a-d may be attached to a bracket 78, which includes a slide 114.  Slide 114 is suspended from and movable within track 116 which is attached to the interior framework 38 of light box 10.   Thus the entire assembly 74 can be withdrawn .from fluid treatment module 28 for reinking,  replacement of markers 76 or for general servicing as shown in Fig. 5,<br>
[00098]     As  shown  in Fig.  12,  each individual  marker unit includes a marker drive motor 120 that moves markers 76 up and<br>
down through gear 122, gear 124, lead screw 128, lead nut 126, bracket 130 and spring 132 . Movement of gears 122 and 124 actuates movement of lead screw 128 and causes downward and/or upward movement of lead nut 126, bracket 130 and consequently marker 76.<br>
[00099]     Fluid treatment module 28 includes blower 134 which provides air flow into fluid treatment chamber 40  and fluid containers and thus, provides for temperature control of fluid treatment chamber 40 (Fig. 5).  Blower 134 receives ambient air through an opening in bottom wall 16 located below blower 134. Blower 134 may be provided with a filter to prevent dust from entering fluid treatment module 26'.   In addition to providing air to fluid treatment chamber 50, air from blower 134 may also pass through opening 136 of fluid treatment module 28 and a perforation or opening 136a in control module 26,  as seen,  for ex.ample in Figs. 2 and 4.   In addition,  fluid treatment module 26 may be provided with an air flow sensor for monitoring air movement.   As shown in Fig.  5,  sensor 135 may be- located at blower 134  or in close proximity thereto in  fluid treatment module 26.   A temperature sensor 135 disposed in light box 10 senses  the  ambient   temperature.     Thus,   if   the  ambient temperature rises above a predetermined threshold temperature, such as may occur if blower 134 fails,  the treatment procedure will be terminated and the container of biological fluids will be marked or identified as unusable.<br>
[000100]    Returning to the fluid treatment module 28 and more specifically fluid carrying drawer 50,  as shown in Figs. 5 and 13,  fluid carrying drawer 50 may include a tray 90 for holding one or more containers of biological fluid.   Tray 90, shown in Fig. 7, may be placed within the cavity 88 of the fluid carrying drawer 50 (Fig. 8).  In one embodiment, tray 90 may be made of a molded plastic material.   Where the biological fluid is treated from  two  sides,   the  molded  plastic  material   should  be sufficiently translucent to the 1ight.provided by the lamps 100. Suitable materials for tray 90 include acrylic polymers such as polymethyl  methacrylate  (PMMA)  or  members  of  the  polyolefin<br>
family such as methylpentene copolymer. Such materials are available from many sources including CYRO Industries of Rockaway, New Jersey under the product name ACRYLITE5' OP4 or from Mitsui Plastics of White Plains, New York under the name<br>
TPX.<br>
[000101]    Where one or more containers are to be treated, tray 90 may be divided into a first portion 180 and a second portion 182 separated by dividing wall 184.   As shown in Fig.  27,  at least a portion of dividing wall 184 may be made o'f or covered with a reflective material of the type described above.   In a preferred  embodiment,   the  portion  of  dividing  wall  that separates   first   compartments   188   (described   below)   is reflective.   A reflective divider provides improved and more uniform distribution of light to the fluid containers.  As shown in Fig. 7, tray 90 may include retaining tabs 186 for placing a slit or other aperture of a biological fluid container 206 over tab 186 to limit movement of the container within tray 90 and ensure that the container is substantially within the field of light  provided by the  light  source.   The volume of  tray 90 should be  sufficient  to hold at  least  the  entire volume of biological  fluid  contained  within  the  container's  so  as  to minimize  the  risk  that,  in  the  event:  of  container  leakage, liquid will overflow and contact the electrical and mechanical components of light box 10, even during agitation.<br>
[000102]    Where  the  biological  container  is  part  of  an integrated    fluid   processing    set,    tray    90   may   be compartmentalized  to  provide  separate  compartments  for  the container  undergoing  treatment  on  the  one  hand,  and  the remainder  or  a  portion  of  the  remainder  of  the  disposable processing set,  on the other hand.   As shown for example,  in Fig. 7, first portion 180 and second portion 182 each include a first compartment  188 and second compartment 190 separated by discontinuous  wall  192.    First  compartment  188  may  hold  a container of biological fluid 206 and the second compartment may hold the remaining components of the fluid processing set.   A slot.  in  the  wall  192  accommodates  the  tubing  that  connects<br>
container 206 with the remainder of the disposable processing set.  The slot may also assist in limiting movement of container 266 within tray 90.  Tray 90 or second compartment 190 of tray may further include container retaining tabs or pegs 193 to hold in place the containers in the second compartment and/or limit movement of such containers within tray 90.  Alternatively, pegs 193 may be located on drawer 50, as shown in Fig. 26. [000103]    When the tray 90 with disposable processing set is introduced into fluid treatment chamber 50, container 206 within a first compartment 188 is positioned substantially within the field of light provided by the light source.   The remainder of the disposable processing set and/or containers within a second compartment 190 are outside the field light, preferably held in place by tray cover 380,  described below.   In the embodiment where marker assembly 74 is provided,  containers within second compartment 190 are aligned substantially with marker assembly 74 as shown in Figs. 4 and 5.  Thus, the status of the treatment may be indicated on the other containers of the processing set within the second compartment 190 by markers 76 a-d. [000104]    In an embodiment where the light box does not include a marker assembly, drawer 50 may include a cover 380 of the type shown  in  Figs.  26-28.    Cover  380  holds  in place  containers within second compartment 190.   As shown in Fig. 28, cover 380 may  be  hingedly  attached  to  drawer  50  and  flipped  over compartments 190 prior to the illumination process. [000105]    As shown in Fig. 28, cover 380 may include latch 382 for securing cover 380 to dividing wall 184 of tray 90.   Cover 380 may also include a plurality of apertures 384 aligned with bag placement sensors (described below).  Cover 380 can be made of any suitable material which is not translucent to light from light: sources.   Preferably, cover 380 is made of aluminum. [000106]    Light  box  10  may  include  sensors  for  detecting different  conditions  during  the  pretreatment  and  treatment processes.  The sensors relay signals to the microprocessor of the light box 10 that is housed within control module 26.   As shown for example  in Fig.  14,  sensors  (e.g.,  404,  430)  send<br><br>
signals  through  the  sensor  input/output  board  33  which translates the signal into a format that is understandable by microprocessor 160.    The computer alerts the operator, either by an audible alarm or a message on the display screen 37.  The operator may, in response to the alarm or message, take action through keypad 39.  Alternatively, in response to certain alarm conditions,   the  control  system  may  be  preprogrammed  to automatically take action,  such as a  terminate  treatment,  if necessary.<br>
[000107] For example, light box 10 may include internal light intensity sensors 404 for measuring the intensity of light provided by the lamps 100 to fluid treatment chamber 50. In the event that the light intensity provided by lamps 100 is insufficient for the desired treatment, sensors 404 send signals through input/output board 33 (Fig. 14) to microprocessor 160 as described above.<br>
[000108]    In one embodiment, light intensity sensors 404 may be located within the light chambers 101 and 103 of light drawers 60 and 70 (Fig. 6) .   In one embodiment,  light drawer 60 and/or 70  include  a  light  intensity  sensor  subassembly  402  on  the underside  of  drawer  60  and/or  70.    As  shown  in  Fig.  6a, subassembly  402  includes  two  or  more  sensors  404  attached thereon and placed within sensor windows  406  located  in  the bottom wall  107 of drawers 60 and/or 70.   Sensor windows 406 allow light from lamps 100 to pass through and contact sensors 404 .   Sensors 404  may  include or be  used  with one or more filters to filter out unwanted light.  More specifically, where light box 10 is used to activate a photochemical agent, it may be desirable that the filters used in association with sensors 404  have a maximum sensitivity in  the wavelength range that substantial ly matches  the  wavelength  range  within which  the particular photochemical  agent  is  most  effectively activated (i.e., the "action curve").  This allows sensors 404 to detect the effectiveness of photochemical activation.   Sensors 404 are available,  for  example,  from  Micropac  Industries,  Inc.  of Garland, TX under part number 61120.  Filters are available from<br>
a variety of sources such as Schott Technical Glass of Duryea, Pennsylvania.<br>
[000109]    A fluid carrying drawer sensor 144 may be included for monitoring the position of  fluid carrying drawer within fluid treatment chamber 40.   Fluid carrying drawer positioning sensor 144 ensures that the drawer 50 is in  a fully closed position and therefore, that containers of biological fluid are substantially within the- field of light provided by lamps 100. If  the drawer is not in a fully closed position,  sensor 144 sends a signal to the microprocessor, alerting the operator and preventing treatment from proceeding.<br>
[000110]    Light  box  10  may,  optionally,   further  include temperature  sensors  145  for  either  directly  or  indirectly monitoring- and measuring the temperature within fluid treatment chamber 40.  Temperature sensor may be disposed within the fluid treatment  chamber 40 or,  as shown in Figs.  4  and 5,  may be disposed on the exterior of light box 10 to measure the ambient temperature of the outside environment.   For example,  ambient temperature sensor 145 may be located anywhere on the surface of light box 10.   In one embodiment,  as shown in Figs.  1 and 2, ambient  temperature  sensor  14S  is  placed at  or  near control module  26.     Ambient  temperature  sensor  145  provides  an indication  of  the  air  temperature  being  delivered  to  fluid treatment  chamber  by  blower  134.   In  the  event  that  the temperature falls outside of a predetermined temperature range, the   ambient  temperature  sensor  sends  a  signal   to  the microprocessor as generally described above,  which alerts the operator that the temperature is approaching or has exceeded its limit.   Accordingly,  the operator and/or  instrument  may take further action.<br>
[000111] Additional sensors may be provided, including a sensor for monitoring the agitation provided by the agitation assembly. In an embodiment of light box 10 that includes marker sub assembly . 74, sensor 430 may be attached to marker subassembly 74, as shown in Fig. 11A, and measures movement of the agitation assembly described above. In an embodiment where<br>
1ight box 10 does not include marker sub-assembly 74, sensor 430 may be attached to marker subassembly 74.   In one embodiment, sensor 430 may include an infrared source  such as,  but  not limited to a light emitting diode (LED) or laser that contacts a selected  reflective  portion of  the  agitation  assembly.    If sensor  430  does  not  detect  reflection  or  does  not  detect reflection  at  the  predetermined  frequency,  it  signals  the microprocessor accordingly.<br>
[000112]    A preferred embodiment of a motion sensor arrangement-fur  the  agitator  system  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  27.    This agitator motion sensor includes a light emitter 386, such as a lamp,  a  light  emitting diode,  a laser diode,  or the  like, disposed on one side of tray 90.   An aperture 388 is defined through one edge of cover 380 and a light detector 385, such as a photo-diode, photo-transistor, photo-multiplier tube, or the like,  is disposed on the opposite side of cover 380 ' from the light emitter 386.  When aperture 388 is in alignment with light emitter 386 and with  light detector 385,  a  brief electronic pul.se will  be generated by light detector 385 when light  is transmitted through aperture 388 to light detector 385.   Based upon  the  rate  of  pulses,  the  speed  of  agitation  can  be determined or confirmed.   Also,  if no pulses are received,  it can be assumed that the agitator system is not in motion. [000113]    Light box 10 may also include a sensor 440 to detect whether  the  front  door  of  the  light  box  is  closed  during treatment.   Door sensor may be a magnetic switch that detects contact between door 36 and magnetic plate 441 shown in Fig.  3. Also,  plunger switch 36a  (Fig.  4)  is pressed when door 36 is closed.   If door 36 is open,  plunger switch 36a serves as an electrical cut off.   If, the door is open, the system will not permit  the treatment to proceed.   Alternatively,  light box 10 may  include a door  lock  388.   Door  lock  388  may include  a solenoid that  establishes  contact  with a pin on door 36 and ensures -that, door 36 remains locked during treatment. [000114]    Light  box  10  may  also  include  sensors  450  for determining whether containers are in position for marking by<br>
markers 76.   In the embodiment wherein light box 10 includes marker sub-assembly 74,  shown in Fig.  11A,  sensors 450 may be attached to markers 76 and may include optical receivers aligned with light emitting diodes (LED)  (not shown) typically located below fluid carrying tray 90.   The labels of containers placed within the second compartment 190 of tray 90 or a holder or organizer used to hold together containers in compartment 190, prevent optical  receiver 450  from receiving the LED signal, indicating the presence of a container.   Conversely, if sensor 450 receives the signal,  this  indicates  that no container is present and the marker will not be activated.  In addition, each marker 76a-d may include a microswitch (shown as 470 in Fig. 14) to detect whether movement of the marker has occurred and to prevent mechanical failure or damage to the parts that make up the marker.<br>
[000115]    Returning to Fig. 27, in an embodiment where light box 10 does not include marker sub-assembly 74, a pair of light emitters 383 and 384 may be disposed on one side of an edge of cover  380.    A pair of  light  detectors  381  and  382  may be disposed on an opposite side of the edge of cover 380.  A pair of apertures 387 and 389 is defined through the edge of tray 90. When a container is present, light from light emitters 383 and 384 is obstructed from passing through apertures 387 and 388 to light detectors 381 and 382.   However,  when no container, is present,  light will pass through one or both of apertures 387 and 389,  and corresponding light detectors 381 and/or 382 will generate a signal. Any such signals indicate that no container is present and the instrument  will  either alert  the operator and/or terminate further processing.<br>
[000116]    The electronic circuitry,  generally designated 600, for controlling light box 10 is illustrated in block diagram format in Fig. 33.   A computer printed circuit board (PCB) 602 preferably includes a 486DX4 compatible central processing unit (CPU), or - microprocessor, 603 typically operating at 100 MHz, or more,  to provide,  and to service, a multiplicity of functions. A DRAM module 604 provides memory for CPU 603, which may be, by<br>
way of example, about 32 Megabytes.   Flash memory may be added to a compact flash socket 605. Preferably, about 32 Megabytes of flash  memory  is  provided.  VGA  BIOS  606  is  programmable  to support displays on display screen 37 on control panel 32 (Figs 1 and 2) .  A VGA port 607 provides video information Co display screen 37 on control panel 32 via output lines 608.   A PC/104 port provides an ISA Bus 610 for transferring information to and from computer PCB 602 .<br>
[000117]    Four RS232 compatible ports 612 through 615 provide serial information transfer,  such as from bar code reader 41. One of the RS232 ports is configurable as an RS 485 port,  if desired.  Port 615 is at the rear panel of the light box 10, and ports 612 and 613 are spares.   For example, one of spare ports 612 or 613 may be used for a label printer.  A printer port" 618 on computer PCB 602 is brought out to the back panel of light box 10 as a port 619 for connection to a printer.    Similarly, an Ethernet port  620  on computer PCB 602  is provided as an Ethernet  port  621  on  the  back panel.    Computer PCB  602  is preferably  an  off-the-shelf  computer  board,  such  as  that commercially available from Ampro Computers,  Inc. , San Jose, CA under part  number LB3-486e.   More information about  this and comparable  computer   PCBs   is  available   at   internet   site www.ampro.corn,  which is incorporated herein in by reference in its entirety.<br>
[000118]    An   interface   PCB   606   directly   or   indirectly interfaces computer PCB 602 with most of the other electrical apparatus,  such  as  lamps,  sensors,  displays  and  so  forth. Interface PCB 606 is subdivided into several portions.   An LCD portion 62-4 receives video and control signals from computer PCB via  lines  608  and provides  control  signals  to  a  back  light inverter  (3LI)  PCB 626 to control and to supply power for the backlighting of display panel 37.  LCD portion 624 also supplies video and control signals, and power,  via lines 627 to displary panel  37.   A keypad and LED portion- 630 receives inputs from keypad 39 at the user interface 32,  and sends such inputs to computer PCB 602 via ISA bus 610.<br>
 [000119]    A light sensor portion 634 of interface PCB 606 bi-directionally communicates with a relay PCB 640 via a plurality of lines 635 to provide control output signals and to receive sensor input signals.  A miscellaneous sensors portion 636 and a relay  control  portion  637  bi-directionally  communicate  with relay PCB 640 via a plurality of lines 638 to provide control output signals and to receive sensor input signals.<br>
[000120]    Interface PCB 606 also supplies operating power to the other PCBs.   Interface PCB 606 receives +5 Vdc and +12 Vdc at a connector 622 and +24 Vdc at a connector 623, all from a power supply 167.  Relay PCB 640 is supplied with +5 Vdc and + 24 Vdc on certain of lines 638,  front panel user interface 37 is supplied, with  +5 Vdc  on one  of  lines  627,  BLI  PCB  626  is supplied with +5 Vdc on one of lines 625 and computer PCB is supplied with +5 Vdc and +12 Vdc on certain of lines 610, all from interface PCB 606.   In addition,  relay PCB 640- directly receives 240 Vac from the power supply 167 at a connector 641 to supply power to the shaker motor 92.<br>
[000121]    Relay PCB 640 controls the application of power to upper  lamp ballasts 645 and lower lamp ballasts  646,  such as with  electronic  relays  located  on  relay  PCB  640,  to  supply operating power to upper lamps 100 and to lower lamps 100 under the influence of control signals from light sensor interface 634 on interface PCB 606.   Light sensor circuitry shown in Fig. 34 is disposed on upper and lower light sensor PCBs 643 and 644 and provides signals to relay PCB 640 that are indicative of the intensity of illumination provided by the upper and lower lamps, respectively.  Relay PCB 640 also controls the application of power  to shaker motor  647  and blower  fan  648,  such as with electronic relays, in accordance with control signals from relay control  interface  637  on  interface  PCB  606.    Relay  PCB 640 routes signals from door solenoid 648 and miscellaneous sensors 649 to miscellaneous sensors interface 636 on interface PCB 606. [000122] .   As previously explained, light box 10 has two light chambers 42 and 43 for treating biological fluids in either or both chambers.   Two light arrays consisting of four lamps 100<br><br>
are disposed in an upper position and in a lower position in each chamber for a total of 16 lamps, as seen in Fig.  34.   A light  sensing  system,  for  sensing  the  intensity  of  the illumination  from  lamps  100,  is  generally  designated  650. Disposed adjacently to the upper lamp arrays in chambers 42 and 43 is upper light sensor PCB 643.  Lower light sensor PCB 644 is similarly adjacently disposed  to lower light  arrays.   Light sensors 404 are positioned on upper and lower light sensor PCBs 613 and 644, respectively, between pairs of lamps 100 such that each sensor monitors  the  illumination  level of  two  adjacent lamps.  In this respect, each light sensor is preferably located midway between a pair of monitored lamps 100.  Light sensors 404 provide a frequency output generally in the range of lOHz to 1MHz  depending upon  the  sensed irradiation  level.    In .this application,  sensors 404  preferably operate near a raid-range, such as in about the 1 KHz to 100 KHz range, for example. [000123]    Circuitry associated with each upper or lower light sensor PCB 643 or 644, and which constitutes a portion of light sensing system 650, is shown in greater detail in Fig.  35.  The frequency outputs  from upper light sensors 404  are sent  to a pair  of  multiplexers  651  and  652.    Multiplexer  652  is  a secondary or redundant multiplexer that is used to confirm that data received from multiplexer 651 is accurate.  A test circuit 654 consists of an oscillator 655 that has its frequency divided by a divider 656 to provide three test or reference frequencies on three lines 657, which are provided as inputs to multiplexers 651 and 652.   For exarrple, these test frequencies may be about 230 KHz, 115 KHz and 57.5 KHz.  The power supply +S Vdc is also provided as an input to multiplexers 651 and 652 to monitor the power supply for any undesired noise that could interfere with the signals  from the light sensors.   Three address selection lines  658,   including  AO,  Al  and  A2,  are  used  to  cause multiplexers 651 or 652 to alternately sample one of the outputs from the four light sensors, one of the three test frequencies or the power supply voltage.  For example, the sampling periods may be about 15 milliseconds.   These address selection bits on<br>
1ines 658 are generated by a programmable logic device (PLD) 680 on interface PCB 606 and supplied to upper light sensor PCB by lines 669 and to lower light sensor PCB by lines 668. Lower light sensors 404, multiplexers 660 and 661 and test circuit 662 on lower light sensor PCB 644 operate similarly to the corresponding elements described on upper light sensor PCB 643 to provide a second multiplexed frequency signal.<br>
[000124]    The outputs of multiplexers 652 and 660 are routed to a frequency counter 670 on interface PCB 606 via lines 665 and 664.     The outputs of multiplexers 651 and 661 are routed to frequency counter 671 also on interface PCB 606 via lines 667 and 666.   Counters 670 and 671 . are commercially available from Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA under part number 8254.   PLD 680 selects data from frequency counter 670 by a chip selection line 681 or from frequency counter 671 by a chip selection line 682.  Frequency counters S70 and 671 and PLD 680 share a common data bus 683 for the transfer of data therebetween.   PLD 680 thus receives counts from counters 670 and 671 that represent the frequencies  received by these counters  from multiplexers 651, 652, 660 and 661 which, in turn, represent the illumination levels from all 16 of the lamps .100 in light box 10.   PLD 680 provides this lamp illumination data to computer PCB 602 on data busses 687 and 688.   PLD 680 essentially acts as a conduit for the count information from counters 670 and 671 to computer PCB 602, provides buffering of these count signals and provides chip select functions to select counter 670 or 671.  Counters 670 and 671 can issue interrupt  requests to PLD 680 on lines 684 and 685,  respectively.    PLD 680 can also issue interrupt requests to  computer  PCB  602  on  a  line  686  and  control  signals  are received by PLD 680 from computer PCB 602 on one or more lines 689.    PLD  680  is  commercially  available,  for  example,  from Altera Corporation of San Jose, CA under part number EPM7128S. [000125]    Sensor read software 690 enables CPU 603 on computer PCB 602 to read the data sent from PLD 680 on data busses 687 and 688.   Independent  illumination  software 691  monitors  the data for any malfunction or irregularity.   For example, if the<br>
i1lumination data from any light sensor 404 is below a defined threshold level, one of the lamps 100 may have failed or is providing insufficient illumination. In this instance, a message will be displayed on display 37 to replace one or more lamps 100.<br>
1000126]     Energy  measurement  software   692   measures   the illumination level supplied by lamps 100,  as by analyzing, the frequency counts from PLD 480, and then essentially integrating the   measured   illumination   level   over   time   until   the predetermined illumination dose for the biological fluid being treated  in  light  box  10  is  reached.     Software  692  may recalculate  the  light  intensities  about  every  second,  for example. Frequent recalculations are preferred because the light intensity from lamps 100 changes with temperature.   Based upon these  continuous  recalculations  of  light  intensity,  energy measurement   software   692   also   determines   the   current illumination dose that the biological fluid has been subjected to  since  the  initiation  of  treatment.     Software  692  is essentially  integrating  the  light  intensity  in  real  time  to determine the  current  illumination dose.     Software  692 can similarly estimate how much additional time is required, based upon currently measured light intensities, to reach the desired illumination dose.  Upon reaching the dosage entered by the user at the beginning of treatment, software 692 causes illumination to cease and the user is advised that treatment is completed. [000127]    Software 692 also preferably constantly monitors the count of the test frequencies 657 because these frequencies are known and the count results will confirm the signal paths and counting accuracy with  respect  to the  frequency signals  from light sensors 404.  The redundant light sensing channel provided by  secondary  multiplexers  652  and  661  are  also  preferably monitored to confirm the accuracy of information received from primary multiplexers 651 and 660.   If the frequency count data received from primary multiplexers 651 and 660 are not within a certain  tolerance  with  the  data  received  from  secondary multiplexers 652. and 661, an error message will be supplied to<br>
t he user, as on display 37. When the predetermined illumination dose is reached, energy measurement software 692 terminates illumination in light box 10.<br>
[000128]    In  addition,   a  portable  and  attachable  light intensity  sensing,  verification  and  calibration  device  or radiometer  460  may  be  provided  to  verify  light  intensity provided by light box 10 and for calibration of light box 10. Radiometer  460  may  be  adapted  for  placement  within  fluid treatment chamber 40 for measuring the energy dose delivered to the biological fluid.  More specifically, radiometer 460 may be adapted for placement within the fluid container carrying tray 90.  In  one  embodiment,  radiometer  460  may  be  adapted  for placement  within  a  compartment  of  tray  90  such  as  first compartment 188 of tray 90.<br>
[000129] As shown in Fig. 14A, radiometer 460 may include a support 465 having a top surface 467 and a bottom surface 468. Support 465 is typically a printed circuit board. One or more sensors 469 are electrically and physically connected to support 465. Additionally, as best seen in Fig. 31, support 465 also includes data port 512.<br>
[000130]    It  is  known  that  a  light  source  may  not  always uniformly emit light.   For example, depending on the age of the lamp,  the intensity of light emitted from one part of the lamp may not be the same as the intensity emitted from another part of the lamp.   Accordingly,  in a preferred embodiment, as shown in Fig.  14A,  radiometer 460 may include a plurality of sensors 469 spaced across the top and/or bottom surface(s)  to receive light from different points on one or more lamps.  Also, sensors 469 may be placed on one side of support 465, but preferably are placed on both the top surface 467 and the bottom surface 468. Top  and  bottom  placement  of  sensors  469  is  particularly preferred where radiometer 460 is used to measure light provided by two facing light sources, such as the two arrays of lamps 100 in one of the embodiments of light box 10.<br>
[000131]    Radiometer  460  is  preferably  calibrated  with  a precision light source in accordance with NIST standards.    As<br>
seen in Fig. 29, a bar code 506 may be placed on the edge of one of the halves 504.  Bar code 506 preferably contains information on the identity of each radiometer, such as a unique identifying number or a serial number.  Also preferably included in bar code 506 are the calibration coefficients determined during the most recent calibration of radiometer 460 for each  of the sensors 469, and an expiration date by which radiometer 460 will need to be recalibrated.   For example,  the expiration date may be one year  from  the  date  of  the  most  recent  calibration.    Thus, reading of bar code 506 by bar code reader 41 will provide CPU 603  with  information on the  identity of radiometer 460,  the calibration   coefficients  associated . with   that  particular radiometer,  and the date by which radiometer 460 needs to be recalibrated.<br>
[000132]    Support 465 is preferably housed in cover 501.   As shown in Fig. 31,  cover 501 may be made of two halves 503 and 504 that are attached together.   Cover 501 may include a label 506  (Fig. 29) displaying a unique bar code for each radiometer 460.   As  further  shown in Fig.  31,  radiometer also  includes intermediate panels or substrates 508 and 510.  Cover halves 503 and 50-1  and substrates 508 and 510 may be made of any hard, commercially available molded plastic.   A preferred material is a  terpolymer  of  acrylonitrile,  butyldiene  and  styrene  (ABS) . Slots in cover 501 and substrates 508 and 510 are provided to accommodate sensors 469.<br>
[000133]    A  connector  cable  516,  as shown  in  Fig.  32,  is attached to  radiometer 460 for electrical connection to light box  10 and,  for example,  to port 461  (Fig.  5) .   This allows radiometer 460 to transmit data to the computer PCB 602  (Fig. 33)  of light box 10,  which system provides information to the operator  and/or  automatically  takes  action  based  on  the transmitted data.   Radiometer 460 may also include a slit 472 (Fig.  29)  for placement over tab 186  (Fig.  7)  in tray 90 of light box 10.<br>
[000134]    Sensors 469 are generally any device that is capable of detecting light of selected wavelengths. These sensors are<br>
preferably  robust  such  that  they  reproducibly  detect  the appropriate wavelengths accurately.   In one embodiment,  these sensors may comprise a plurality of optical fibers that absorb the  selected  wavelengths  and  channel  the  light  into  an appropriate detector.  Such optical fibers can be configured to appropriate dimensions to represent the dimensions over which the light delivery is to be measured.   An advantage of this configuration  is  that  the  optical  fibers  can  cover  a  large percentage of the area over which the light delivery is to be measured.  In the preferred sensor embodiment, as represented in Fiq. 14A, sensors 469 in radiometer 460 are preferably the same type of sensor as sensors 404 in light sensing system 650. Of courses,  sensors 404 and 469 need to be capable of detecting light of the desired wavelengths.  Sensors 469 may also include or  be  used  with  filters  to  filter  out  unwanted  light  as substantially described above.<br>
[000135]    When used in connection with light box 10,  it  is<br>
preferred that the dimensions and geometry of radiometer 460 be<br>
substantially equivalent to the dimensions of the fluid-filled<br>
containers used with light box 10.  Accordingly, it is preferred<br>
that the light sensing area of radiometer 460 have a height, a<br>
width  and  a  thickness  substantially  equal  to  such  filled<br>
containers. A radiometer with dimensions substantially equal to<br>
the fluid-filled container provides a reliable approximation of<br>
the energy being delivered to the fluid and of the effectiveness<br>
of the treatment .	<br>
[000136]    As set forth above,  radiometer 460 may be used for light intensity verification by,  for example,  the operator and for calibration of light box 10 generally and more specifically, of internal light sensors 404.  In accordance with the method of using  radiometer  460  for  light  intensity  verification,  the operator may place radiometer 460 in first compartment 188 of tray  90,  as  shown  in  Fig.  32.    Connector cable  516  may be pressed into strain relief tabs 474 within light box 10 (Fig. 8) or,  more preferably,  thread through slot 390 in drawer 50,  as shown in Fig. 32.  The fluid carrying drawer 50 is inserted into<br>
fluid treatment chamber 40 and door 36 is closed. Lamps 100 are turned on and the light delivered is measured by sensors 469 in radiometer 460. Specifically, the light measured by sensors 469 is processed by the system's microprocessor 603 on computer PCB<br>
602	to provide a calibrated reading of the energy being provided<br>
to the fluid treatment chamber 40.   For example, microprocessor<br>
603	may use the calibrated readings of the light levels from<br>
each sensor 649 of radiometer 460  to calculate a calibration<br>
coefficient for light levels sensed by each sensor 404 on upper<br>
and lower light sensor PCBs 643 and -644.   Thereafter,  energy<br>
measurement   software   692    (Fig.    34)    associated   with<br>
microprocessor 603 can apply these calibration coefficients to<br>
the illumination measurements from light sensors 404 to provide<br>
corrected light level measurements that will approximate those<br>
measured by radiometer 640.   The flow- chart in Fig.  21A also<br>
provides  information  about  the  processes  of  determining  the liqht intensity and determining the treatment time. [000137]    The operator can monitor the output of lamps 100 and determine any diminishment in the lamp output by comparing the reading to a pre-set acceptable energy dose range.  In addition, the readings provided by sensors469 are also compared to the readings  provided  by  sensors  404  to  detect  any  diminished sensing capability of sensors 404.  The process may be repeated with the other first compartment 188.<br>
[000138]    Thus,  for example  if  the energy dose  measured  by radiometer  460  is  substantially  equal  to  the  energy  dose detected by sensors 404, but is outside the pre-set dose range, this may be an  indication that  the output of  lamps  100 has diminished  and  that  lamps  100  may  have  to  be  replaced. Alternatively,  if the energy dose as measured by radiometer 460 is  substantially equal  to the  expected pre-set  dose of  the instrument,  but  both  are  different  from  the  energy dose  as measured by sensors 404, this may be an indication that sensing capability of sensors 404 has diminished.   Finally,  if the dose as  measured  by  sensors  404  is  substantially  equal  to  the expected pre-set dose,  but different  than the  energy dose as<br>
measured by radiometer 460, this may indicate that the sensing capability of radiometer 460 has diminished. Radiometer 460 may also be used to calibrate light box 10. Radiometer 460 itself may be calibrated against a standard (e.g. a standard from the National Institute for Standards and Technology or NIST), or by using an independent calibration system that has been calibrated to NIST standards.<br>
[000139]    Of course, it -will be appreciated that radiometer 460 may have utility in other applications and is not limited to use in the apparatus or methods of the present invention.   Indeed, radiometer 460 may be used whenever light is to be measured over an  extended  surface  area  or  from  opposite  directions. Radiometer 460 also has utility where it is desired to average light intensity measurements over a surface area, including non-p]anar surfaces.  It will be readily appreciated that radiometer 4 60 could be configured with complex, non-planar surfaces, if so desired.<br>
[000140]    The  components  of  the  fluid  treatment  module  28 including the agitator assembly,  the light sources, the blower, the  marker  subassembly  are  powered  by  power  supplies  in  an alternative embodiment of the electronic control system   shown in Fig. 14.   In Fig. 14, the letter "n" represents the number of electrical  or  mechanical  components  such  as  sensors,  lamps, ballasts etc..  For example, power supplies (ballasts)  166 power lamps  100  and  are  controlled  by  relay  board  and  isolation transformer 29.  Shaker motor 92 is powered through relay board and  isolation  transformer  29.    Additional  power  supply  168 supplies power for the blower 134,  light drawer fans 109, and drive  motors  120  for  markers  76a-d  and  door  lock  480. Preferably,  the power supply for powering these components may be approximately 24 volts DC.  Power supply for powering shaker motor may be 230V AC.   Power supply 167 may supply +5 and +12 volts DC to, for example, computer board 160.<br>
[000141] Finally, light box 10 includes a programmable computer software-based control system 600 to control the operation of light box 10 that has already been described with<br>
reference to Figs. 33-35. The control system 600 is further generally and diagrammatically depicted in Figs. 19-23 and is described in greater detail in connection with the description of the method of processing and treating a biological fluid which follows the description of the disposable processing set provided below.<br>
b. Disposable Processing Set<br>
[000142]    Disposable processing sets useful with light box 10 are shown in Figs. 15-18.  Typically, the disposable processing set  will  include  two  or  more  plastic  containers  integrally connected by plastic tubing.   At. least one of the containers should be suitable for holding the biological fluid during light treatment.   The other container should be suitable for storage of  the biological fluid after treatment. As described in more detail below, the disposable processing set may be joined with containers of biological fluid, and the fluid may be transferred to containers of the disposable processing set.  Further details about these disposable processing sets are described in the U.S. Patent   Application   entitled   "Fluid   Processing   Sets   and organizers  for  the  Same,"  bearing  Attorney  Docket  No,  F8-5459CIP,  filed October  11,  2002,  and  incorporated  herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
[000143]    One embodiment of a disposable fluid processing set 200  is  shown  in  Fig.  15.    Processing  set  200  includes  a container 202, a container 206, a container 210 and a container 211.    The  containers  may  be  integrally  interconnected  with tubing  segments  as  generally  shown  and  described  in  detail below.   The sizes and internal volumes of containers 202,  206, 210 and 214 may vary depending on the biological fluid being processed.    In a  non-limiting example,  container  202  may be capable of holding approximately 5-30 ml of fluid,  containers 206  and  210  approximately  1000 ml  and container 214  between approximately 1000-1500 ml.   Of course,  other desirable sizes and volumes may be used and are within the scope of the present invention. [000144]    Where the disposable processing set is used in or as<br>
part of a pathogen inactivation treatment,  container 202 may include, for example, a photochemical agent which is mixed with the biological  fluid.   Examples of  such photochemical agents include  psoralen  compounds  described  in  U.S.   Patent  No. 5, 709, 991 and compounds from the family of phenothiazine dyes such as,  but not  limited to,  methylene blue and riboflavin. Container 202 may be made of any material suitable for holding such photochemical agents.  One such material may be a blend of ethylene  polypropylene,  polyamide  and  a  block  copolymer  of ethylene  and  butylene  with  terminal  blocks  of  polystyrene. Containers  made  of  such material  are  available  from Baxter Healthcare Corporation under the name PL2411.   Container 202 includes a tubing segment 203 extending therefrom and having a sealed end 204.   A second tubing 205 extending from container 202  is  integrally  connected  to  container  206.    In  another embodiment,   the  photochemical  agent  may  be  contained  or predisposed within container 206,  thereby eliminating the need for  a  separate  container  202'  for  holding  the  photochemical agent.  In still another embodiment, the photochemical agent may be combined with the biological fluid prior to joinder to the disposable processing set.  For example, the photochemical agent may be included in a container 201 used to hold the biological fluid collected from a donor (Fig. 17).<br>
[000145]    Container 206 is preferably a container suitable for holding   the   biological   fluid   during   light   treatment. Accordingly,  it  is desirable that container 206 be made of a clear,  durable,  thermoplastic material  that  is  translucent  to light of the selected wavelength and sterilizable by known forms of  sterilization  including  steam  sterilization,   gamma  and electron beam radiation.   For example, where the blood product to be treated includes blood platelets or blood plasma and the treatment  is to be with light  in the UVA range,  container is made of  a  material  that  is substantially translucent  to UVA light and remains stable after sterilization.   Such materials may  include  polyvinyl  chloride,  but  more preferably,  may be blends  of  thermoplastic  polymers  and  copolymers,  including<br>
qeneral purpose polymers,  elastomers and the like.   One such material  includes  the block copolymer described  above  which includes a central block of ethylene and butylene and terminal blocks of polystyrene.   Block copolymers of the type described above are available from the Shell Chemical Company under the name KRATON.   The block copolymer may be blended with other polymers  such  as  ultra  low-density polyethylene  (ULDPE)  and ethylene vinyl acetate  (EVA) .   Containers made of the blended material  are available  from Baxter Healthcare  Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois under the name PL-2410.  Other thermoplastic materials may also  be  suitable  for  container  206,  including materials including KRATON, EVA, and polypropylene.  A container made from such material is also available from Baxter Healthcare Corporation  under  the  name  PL-732.    Still  other  suitable materials  for  container  206  include  fluoropolymers  such  as po1ytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), PFA or copolymers including such fluoropolymers.<br>
[000146] Container 206 further includes a slit 207 which, as described above, may be placed over retaining tab 186 in tray 90. Container 206 includes a tubing segment 208 which may be integrally connected to a container 210.<br>
[000147]    In  the  pathogen  inactivation of  biological  fluid, container 210 may,  for example,  include an adsorbent material 21 1 for removing excess photochemical agent or the byproducts of the  photoact ivat ion  process.   The  adsorbent  material  may be contained in a semi-permeable pouch,  preferably affixed to the container walls or portions thereof within the interior chamber of container 210.   The interior chamber of container 210 has a volume sufficient to hold the biological fluid from container 206.  Such a container and the adsorbent material are disclosed in more detail in copending patent application entitled "Plastic Containers  Having  Inner  Pouches  and  Methods  for  Making  Such Containers" which is being filed simultaneously herewith in the names of Mahmood Mohiuddin, George D. Cimino and Derek J. Hei , and  is incorporated by reference in its entirety.   Materials such  as  those  used  in  the  PL-2410  and  PL-732  containers<br>
described above are suitable for use in container 210. [000148]    Container 210 may also include a time-sensitive tape 209.   Tape 209 changes color with time,  thus informing the operator if the biological fluid has contacted the adsorbent material for a sufficient period of time.    Container.  210  may be  integrally  connected  by  tubing  segment  211  to  another container  214  which  may  be  suitable  for  storage  of  the biological fluid.   As shown in Fig. 15,  the portion of tubing segment 211 that communicates with the interior of container 210 m.;ty  include  a  filter  211a  to  capture  loose  particles  of adsorbent, if any.<br>
[000149]    Container  214  may  include  and/or  be  capable  of receiving a label 216 which may carry bar codes 222 or other indicia that provide  information about the biological  fluid. For example, bar codes 222 may identify the donor, the product, the lot number of the biological fluid, expiration date and the like.  Container 214 may include additional bar codes or indicia 224 which are used- to provide information regarding the status or progress of the fluid treatment  (described in more detail below) .   Container 214  may also  include a  slit  226  and/or apertures 228,  230 for placement over corresponding pegs  (193) on  tray  90.    Materials  such  as  those  described  above  are suitable  for use  in  container  2m.    Container  214  may also include sampling pouches 214a and access ports 214b to allow for fluid access during later transfusion, as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill.<br>
[000150]    In an alternative embodiment,  disposable processing set  may include a single container  for housing the adsorbent material of container 210 and for storing the biological fluid, thereby  combining  the  functions  o.f  container  210  and  214 described above.<br>
[000151] The disposable processing set 200 described herein may further include frangible members 230 (a-c) disposed within tubing segments as shown in Fig. 15. Frangible members 230 are broken at the appropriate time to establish fluid communication between the containers of the processing set 200. Such<br>
frangible connectors are described in detail in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,294,297 which is  incorporated by reference  herein.   Tubing<br>
segments of disposable processing set 200 may  further include<br>
indicators  234a  and  234b  on  the  tubing  to  indicate  proper<br>
positioning of the disposable processing set within the tray 90<br>
(as will  be described more detail below)  and/or to serve as<br>
indicators of where tubing is to be severed and sealed.  In one<br>
embodiment, indicators 234 may be plastic rings disposed around<br>
tubing segments.   Of course, other tubing indicating means may<br>
be used.<br>
[000152]    Another embodiment of a fluid processing set is shown in Fig.  16.   In Fig.  16,  disposable processing set 240 also includes a container 242 which carries a photochemical agent, a container 244  which  holds  the biological  fluid during  light treatment, a container 246 which includes an adsorbent material for removing excess photochemical agent and/or the byproducts of the photoactivation process,  and a container 248 suitable for storage of the biological fluid.    Container 248 is adapted to receive  label  249  with  bar  codes  or  other  indicia  and  may include   additional   indicia   251   including,   for   example, additional bar codes as substantially described above. [000153]    In  contrast  to  the  container  210  of  the  earlier described embodiment,  container 246  is  a  flow  through device which  includes adsorbent material  212 but does  not  include a chamber  for holding  the biological  fluid  for  any significant period of  time.   Such  flow through devices  are described in International Publication No. WO 96/40857, which is incorporated by reference herein.   Disposable processing set 240 may further include an air reservoir 256 and air sink 258.   Air reservoir 256 provides air to help expel biological fluid from container 244 and air sink 258 receives excess air expelled from storage container 248 after processing.  Air reservoir 256 and air sink 258  may  be  made  of  any  suitable  biocompatible  material, including  the  materials  described  above.     Likewise,   the containers of disposable processing set 240 may also be made from  the  materials  generally  described  above.    Preferably,<br><br>
container 256 is substantially impermeable to air.<br>
[000154] As in the embodiment of Fig. 15, the containers of disposable processing set 240 shown in Fig. 16 may be integrally interconnected by tubing segments 243, 245 and 247. Tubing segments may further include frangible members 249 (a-c) for opening - fluid communication between the containers.<br>
[000155]    Disposable processing set 200  (or 240)  is typically provided to the user in a sealed package in a manner that is easy for the user to unpack and use.  For example, upon opening the package, it is preferred chat the container to be used first in the fluid processing be located near the top of the package. For example,  in  the processing set  200  shown  in  Figure  15, container 202  would be located near the top of  the package, followed by container 206,  followed by  the  remainder of  the disposable processing set that includes containers 210 and 214. In  addition,  if  disposable processing  set  includes  container 202,  (or  242  in  the  embodiment  of  Fig.  16)  at  least  such container  should  include  a  separate  and  additional  light impermeable  overwrap  to  protect   the  contents   (i.e.   the photochemical agent)  from exposure to light which could result in premature  activation of  the photochemical  agent.   In one embodiment,  the  light  impermeable overwrap may be permanently sealed to the outer walls of container 202.<br>
[000156] In a preferred embodiment, containers 210 and 214 may be contained within or held together by a holder. Holder may be any device such as a clamp that holds together containers 210 and 214. The holder may be integral with the disposable processing set or may be provided separately.<br>
[000157]    More preferably,  holder 260,  shown in Figs.  17-18, may be a receptacle or other shell-like holding device.  In one embodiment ,  holder  260 may  include  a  bottom  wall  262  which separates the containers 210 and 214 from container 206.   In a preferred embodiment, holder 260 may have sidewalls 262 and 264, a back wall 268 and includes a substantially open front portion as  shown  in Figs.  17-18.    In addition,  bottom wall  262  may include  a  slot  263  to  accommodate  tubing  that  connects<br><br>
containers of disposable processing set  200.   Holder 260 may also include additional side openings 265  (shown,  for example, in Fig. 17) for holding tubing segments of container 202 prior to unpackaging of the disposable processing set.  Holder 260 may be made of any suitable material such as but not limited to plastic or cardboard.   Preferably,  holder 260  is made of a moldable plastic material  that may be sterilizable and impact resistant .<br>
[000158]    Alternative embodiments of holder 260 are shown in Figs.  18A-18D.   As shown in Figs.  18A-18C,  holder, may include two frame or partial frame portions 600 and 602.  Frame portions 600 and 602 may be joined and include hinge 604 as shown in Fig. 18B and 18C.   Alternatively, frame members 600 and 602 may be completely separable as shown in Fig. 18D.   Frame portions 600 and 602 include means for securing together the frame portions such as mating slots 605 and pins or lugs 606 as shown.  Holder 260 shown in Figs.  18A-18D includes a central opening 608  to allow the label of a container placed within holder 260 to be exposed  to the outside environment  to allow scanning by,  for example,  a  bar  code  reader  and/or marking  by markers  76  as described below.<br>
[000159]    In one embodiment,  container 210 is placed  in the front portion of holder 260, such that a label to be applied to the container 210 and other indicia on the container itself are exposed to the outside environment through the open portion of holder 260 as shown in Fig.  17.   For purposes of illustration, in Figs. 17-18,  label is shown as applied to container 214.   In one embodiment container 214 may not include label at the time of use and a label may be transferred to container 214  from a container of biological fluid. Alternatively, container 214 may include a label and an additional label may be transferred from a container of biological fluid.   In any event,  container 214 may be folded in half  (or tri-folded) with container 210  (also folded)  placed  behind  container  214.    In  addition.  folded cont ainer 214 may be lightly spot welded at its ends to keep the container folded and improve handleability of  the container.<br>
The weld should be sufficiently strong to keep container 214 in a folded position, but not so strong that undue force applied by the user would be required to disconnect the welded ends. Spot welded ends of container 210 'should release when tugged gently by the user.<br>
Methods of Processing and Treating Fluid<br>
[000160]    The  method  of  processing  fluid  using  disposable processing set 200 (or 240) and treating a biological fluid with light  in,  for example,  light box 10 will now be described. Although  the  following  description  will  be  provided  in  the context  of  processing  the  biological  fluid  for  subsequent inactivation of pathogens in the biological fluid, it should be understood that many of the steps described below may also be carried out in other fluid processing and treating methods that do not involve pathogen inactivation.  The following description will be provided using the disposable processing set of Fig. 15 as  an  example,  although  it  will  be  understood  that  the description may also apply to other processing sets, such as the set of Fig 16.<br>
[000161]    In  accordance  with  the  method  of  processing  a biological fluid such as blood using the processing set 200,  a container of collected blood or biological fluid is provided. Although the method of collection is beyond the scope of the present application,  representative methods of collecting blood products   include   the   automated   and   manual   centrifugal processing,   separation  and  collection  of  blood  products, membrane separation of blood products and the like.  One example of  a  centrifugal  blood  processing  system  is  the  AMICUS® Separator sold by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.<br>
[000162]    Regardless of  the collection method,  containers of the collected blood product will typically bear a label that includes information  identifying the donor,  the blood product and lot numbers.   Most typically, such information is presented in the form of one or more bar codes on- the label, which can be scanned and read by bar code reader, such as bar code reader 41 of light box 10. Such labels may be removable and transferable<br>
to container 214 of the disposable processing set 200. [000163]     Typically,  the collection container will include a tubing segment extending therefrom.   Accordingly,  tubing from the collection container 201 and tubing segment  203  from the disposable processing set 200 are brought together and joined in a sterile manner, as shown generally in Fig. 17.  A device that is  useful  for  the  sterile  joinder  of  tubing  portions  is available from Terumo Corporation of Japan and sold under the name Terumo SCD.   This device heat seals two opposing tubing portions in a sterile manner.   The heat from the heat sealing kills any bacteria from the outside environment that may enter or  reside  in  the  tubing  segments,  thereby  preserving  the sterility of the entire processing set.   Of course, any method and apparatus for joining two tubing segments while maintaining sterility may be used.<br>
[000164]    Once  tubing  segments  have  been  joined,  frangible member 230a  is broken to provide an open flow path from the collection  container  201  to  the  container  206  (Fig.  15). Photochemical agent from container 202 is also allowed to flow into container 206.    After  fluid  transfer  to  container 206, tubing segment may be severed and sealed and the portion of the disposable processing set  that  included container 202 and the collection  container(s)  201  are  discarded.    Indicator  234a provides  a  reference point  as  to where  the  tubing  is  to be severed.  It is preferable that the indicator be placed as close as possible to the container 206 so that most of the biological fluid is retained within container 206 where it  is most likely to be mixed and treated.<br>
[000165]    Before   or   after  placement   of   the  disposable processing set in tray 90, operator may scan the label and other container indicia with bar code reader 41.  Bar codes 222 on the main container label  216 or the container itself provide the instrument with information regarding the biological fluid to be treated.   Based on the data,  the light treating instrument or operator prescribes  the light dosage and  then  calculates  the duration of the treatment.<br>
 [000166]    Container 206 of disposable processing set 200 is typically placed in first compartment of tray 90.   Slit 207 in container  206  is  placed  over  retaining  tab  186  in  first compartment 188 and holder 260 with containers placed therein is placed within the second compartment  190 of tray 90.   Slits and/or  apertures  in container 216  are  likewise placed  over retaining tabs or pegs 193 in second compartment 190.   Tubing connecting container 206 with container 210 (and/or 214) may be pressed into the slot in wall 192.   It is preferable that the tubing be positioned parallel to the direction of the side-to-side oscillation provided by the  agitator assembly described above.    This  further  ensures  that  any  fluid  within  tubing segment 208 is also mixed.  Indicator 234b not . only serves as a reference point for severance of the tubing but also serves as a reference  point  for  container  placement  by  ensuring  that substantially the entire container and biological fluid therein is within the field of light.   The indicator has a diameter greater than the width of the slot.<br>
[000167] Once the containers are in their respective compartments of tray 9.0, fluid carrying drawer 50 is closed. As set forth above, plunger switch 36a (Fig. 4) is pressed when door 36 is closed. If door 36 is open, plunger switch 36a serves as an electrical cut off. If, the door is open, the system will not permit the treatment to proceed.<br>
[000168]    Light  box  10  includes  a  programmable  computer software-based control system to control the operation of light box 10.   The control system is generally and diagrammatical1y depicted in Figs. 19-23.  As shown in Figures 19-23, the system tests, monitors and controls various aspects of the light box 10 and treatment operation such as the start up, container loading, container treatment and container unloading stages of the light box operation.   The control system allows the operator to take action or advises the operator of the treatment status through either an alphanumeric or a graphical user interface, displayed on screen 37.   The various functions may be initiated by the operator through control panel or automatically by the control<br>
system itself .<br>
[000169]    For example as shown in Fig. 19, after the operator has turned on the instrument (step 700), the control system will initiate a series of steps including checking for file system integrity  700a,  loading  the  software  700b,  displaying  the graphical user interface  (GUI)  screen 701,  and continuing to initialize 702 the light box 10 until a screen is generated requesting the user to log in 703.  After the user logs in, the main menu 704 is displayed.   The operator may then select from the series of available functions 705 including the treatment function 706, the print function 707 or the illuminate settings 708.   Alternatively,  the operator may choose the exit function 712 to exit the system.   Diagnostic checks  710 may also be selected and performed, typically by a service technician. [000170]    If the treatment function 706 in Fig. 19 is selected, the  control  system,   through  the  programmed  software  will automatically determine if treatment is appropriate 713 and more particularly, if light box 10 is prepared for treatment as shown in Fig. 2CA.  Thus, for example, if the system detects a failure in the light source, or a failure in one of the sensors or other equipment, an error message 714 will be displayed and the user will  be  requested to press the enter 714a option.   Treatment will  then  not  be  enabled  and  will  not  proceed  until  the condition is  remedied.   If  treatment  is enabled however,  the system will then determine if treatment was otherwise cancelled 7]5.   If not, the system will prompt the operator to input the container  (i.e.  biological  fluid)  information  716.   Container information may be input manually or by scanning bar codes 222 on,  for example,  container 214 shown in Fig.  15.   The system again determines if the treatment process has been cancelled. If the data from the bag information entry in step 716 is valid at stop 718, the system proceeds to the next function or phase as generally shown in Fig. 20B.<br>
[000171] As shown in Figure 20B, the control system displays additional options for the operator to select at step 719. For example, the operator may proceed to treatment of the container,<br>
request treatment of a second container or cancel the operation entirely as shown at step 720.  At step 719, the user may elect to return or to enter the next selection.  If "Bag 2" option is selected at step 719a, the operator is again requested to input container information at step 722 and the system will repeat the steps generally described above before commencing the treatment process at step 724a.  If treatment on a single container is to be performed,  the operator selects the treatment function at step 324,  which is described in more detail below.   When the treatment process at step 724 is finished,  the system prompts the  user  for  another  treatment.    If  another  treatment  is selected at step 726, the system returns to point A in Fig. 20A to input the new bag information, step 716, and to determine if the new bag information is valid, step 718, while continuing to permit treatment to be cancelled at steps 715 and 717. [000172]    After containers have been placed into tray 90,  to commence treatment the system activates the light source(s) 100, shaker motor 92 and fans as shown in step 728 of Fig. 21.  The instrument  may  display,  for  verification  by  the  operator, information regarding the fluid to be treated and the treatment process  generally,  as  at  step  730.    For  example,  in  one embodiment, the instrument may display, the predetermined target dose  of  energy  to  be  applied  to  containers,  the  selected treatment time and a running value of the dosage percent being applied to the biological fluid during the treatment as shown in step  730.   Treatment  will  continue unless  terminated by the operator  or  automatically  terminated  by  the  instrument  in response to an alarm condition.<br>
[000173]    In one embodiment, container may be marked by markers 76  at  the  beginning  of  treatment  and  after  treatment  is completed.  The marks made by marker 76 obliterate or otherwise masks the bar code,  making it unreadable.   Thus,  a container with two masked bar codes 224 indicates that treatment has been successfully completed.   On the other hand, if only one of the bar codes 224 has been masked, this serves as an indication that treatment was not successfully completed and the container may<br>
have to be discarded.   Masking of bar codes 224 by markers 76 also ensures chat a treated container will not be treated again. [000174]    During  treatment,  the  system  performs  a'n  energy calculation at step 732,  which is computed by multiplying the light  intensity  sensor  readings  by  preselected  calibration factors, averaging the readings across the sensors in the same chamber and plane and adding the reading received for planes in the  same  chamber.    The  control  system further verifies  the treatment status at step 734.  If treatment is completed at step 735, the system will check the keypad at step 735a and determine if  the stop key was pressed at step 735b before turning off lamps 100 as shown at step 736.<br>
[000175]    The system may automatically update information on the lamp life as shown at step 737 and update container records at step 738. Control system may continue to power shaker motor 92 until terminated.   The results are preferably transmitted to a  microprocessor  or  central  processing  unit  (CPU)  603  on computer board 602 (Fig. 33).  After treatment,  the system will prompt  the operator to unload containers at step 742 and may prompt the user to perform another treatment, if desired, as at step 725 in Fig. 20B.  The process may be repeated as generally described above.<br>
[000176]    The  process  of  determining  the  light  intensity, determining  the  current  energy  dose  and  determining  the treatment time based upon a predetermined or target energy dose is shown in the flow chart of Fig. 21A.   This corresponds,  in part ,  to the energy calculation step 732  in Fig.  21.   It  is assumed that  treatment has been initiated at  step 724,  which also  corresponds  to  steps  724  or  724a  in  Fig.  20B.    When treatment is initiated, lamps 100 are illuminiated at step 770. Light sensors 404 at step 771 make a measurement of the light intensity  from  lamps  100.    Light  sensors  404  convert  the measured  i1lumunination level  into a signal  with a  frequency that is related to the sensed light intensity at step- 771.  At step 772,  the signals from each sensor 404 are combined by a multiplexer into a multiplexed frequency signal.   At step 773,<br>
the frequencies of each sensor in the miltiplexed signal are counted to provide a count that represents a composite of the illumination levels measured each for each light  sensor.   The count of the test frequency signals 657 is then checked at step 774  to determine the accuracy of  the  counted test frequency signals from step 773.   Since the frequencies of test signals 657 are known,  the count of these frequencies will confirm the accuracy of the information counted by the counter.   This in turn, will determine the reliability of the count of the sensor signals from step 773.   Ac step 775,  the counts of the sensor signals step 773,  and the count of the test frequencies from step 774, are compared to corresponding counts from a secondary or: redundant sensing circuit,  to confirm that the counts from the primary sensing circuit are valid.  At step 776, calibration coefficients are applied to each sensor count by CPU 603  to provide   a   corrected   signal   count.      These   calibration coefficients are defined during the calibration procedure,  as will be explained below, in Fig. 21B.   With a corrected signal count,  CPU 603 can determine the corresponding light intensity level in light box 10 at step 777.   The light sensing system typically measures the light intensity about once every second. Using  the  corrected  light  intensity  measurements,  CPU  603 continuously  updates  the  current  energy  dose  that  has  been delivered to one or both of treatment chambers 42 and/or 44 . Based upon  the current energy dose and the current corrected illumination  level,  CPU can determine the remaining treatment time as well as the total treatment time, at step 779, needed to deliver  the  target  dose,  which was  identified as one of  the treatment parameters at step 730 in Fig. 21.   When target dose is reached, treatment is terminated and illumination ceases, at step 779a.<br>
[000177] The process of calibrating the light box 10 with a pair of radiometers 460 is illustrated in Fig. 21B. The user first selects the calibration mode at step 780. Preferably, a bar code on radiometer 460 is first scanned to identify the radiometer being used at step 781. As previously explained this<br>
bar code identifies radiometer 460 by serial number or the like, provides  calibration  codes,  such  as  for  each  sensor  469  in radiometer 460,  and also provides an expiration date before which radiometer 460 will need recalibration.   The radiometer calibration codes are provided to CPU 603 for use in correcting light intensity measurements made by the radiometer.   The user then places radiometer 460 in one of the compartments of tray 90 such as the compartment that corresponds to first chamber 42 of light  box 10,  as  in step  782.    Preferably,  the previously described agitator system is started so that, the radiometer measures light intensities from lamps 100 as if radiometer 460 is a biological fluid under treatment.  As previously described and as shown in Fig. 14A, radiometer 406 has eight light sensors 469 disposed on each side, with four sensors located near the corners and the remaining four sensors located more centrally between  the four corners.   Note  that radiometer 460 will  be measuring light intensity as actually received by a biological fluid after being filtered by any filters and as received after light  transmission through tray 90 from the  lower lamps 100. The light intensities measured by radiometer 460 are therefore more  accurate  that  the  light  intensities  measured  by  light sensors 404, which are disposed on the opposite sides of lamps 100 from radiometer 460.   Radiometer 460 is thus able to more accurately measure light intensity in tray 90 where biological fluids are placed for treatment.   It is therefore desirable to calibrate light sensing system 650 to measure light intensity received at  tray 90 similarly to that measured  by radiometer 460.<br>
[000178]    CPU  603  receives  data  from  each  sensor  469  in radiometer 640 to measure the light intensity in step 783.   At the same time,  CPU 603 receives data from both upper and lower light sensors 404 in step 784, which corresponds to steps 771-773 in Fig. 21A.   In step 785, CPU 603 calculates a calibration coefficient  for each  sensor  404  based  upon  the  corrected illumination  intensity  readings  from  radiometer  460  and  the uncorrected illumination intensities  from illumination sensing<br>
system 650.<br>
[000179]    Calibration  coefficient  or  correction  coefficient means any number or set of numbers that  is used to correct measured  illumination  intensities  to  within  a  predefined tolerance of NIST standards.   Thus,  a general objective is to transfer the more accurate illumination measurement capabilities of the pre-calibrated radiometer 460 when disposed in treatment chambers 42 or 44 to the more remotely located light sensing system 650 such that light sensing system 650 will measure light intensities in chambers 42 and 44 in a manner similar to that of radiometer  460  when  disposed  therein.     These  calibration coefficients are preferably linear scaling factors that enable the light  sensing system 650  to emulate  the  light measuring accuracy of radiometer 460 in the treatment  chambers.   These calibration  coefficients,  as  determined  in  step  785,  are temporarily stored in memory for future use.<br>
[000180]    At the conclusion of the calibration procedure with a first  radiometer  460,  the  user  will  be  prompted  to  again calibrate the first chamber 42 with a second radiometer 460. Use  of  a  second  radiometer  is  preferred  to  confirm  the calibration results obtained from the first radiometer.    The user scans a bar code on the second radiometer so that light box 10 can confirm that a different radiometer is being used.  Steps 782-785  are  repeated  with  the  second  radiometer. -  If  the calibration results from the second radiometer at step 785 are within  a  certain  tolerance,  such  as  about  10  percent,  the calibration coefficient results are saved in memory, at step 787 for use in obtaining corrected light intensity measurements.  If the results are not within the defined tolerance, it is assumed that  one  of  the two  radiometers  is  faulty and  the user  is instructed to return both  radiometers for service.   In this instance, none of the calibration coefficients is saved for use in  calculating  the  light  intensities,  and  the  calibration coefficients . from  the  last  prior  recalibration  procedure continue to be used. [000181]       This ends the calibration procedure for the first<br>
compartment of the light box 10, at step 788, and steps 781-787 are preferably repeated to calibrate the light intensity measurements in the second compartment.<br>
[000182]    Treatment time and energy dosage will vary depending on  the  biological  fluid  to  be  treated.    For  example,  the treatment time may be at least one minute but may also be less than one minute.   Where light box 10 is used for the pathogen inactivation of biological fluid, the treatment may typically be anywhere between 1-30 minutes.   For example,  for the pathogen inactivation of blood platelets,  treatment is typically between 1-10 minutes, but more typically approximately 3-4 minutes.  For the pathogen inactivation of blood plasma,  treatment may also preferably be approximately 3-4 minutes.<br>
[000183]    Energy per  unit area, or energy flux, is the product of power per unit area or, in the case of radiant flux, at the target,  and the time of exposure.   Accordingly,  the amount of energy per unit area delivered to the target  (for example,  in one  embodiment,  the  biological  fluid)  will  vary  with  the duration of exposure and the irradiance the radiant power per unit area incident on the target.   In one embodiment the total radiant energy flux delivered may be between approximately 1-100 J/cm2   measured   across   a   wavelength   range   of   between approximately 300-700 nm.   However,  any useful wavelength that activates photochemical agents may be used.   In general,  light box 10 can be retrofitted for various illumination frequencies to  illuminate  treatment  targets  in  treatment  chamber  40, including those light frequencies outside of the range of 300-700 nm.<br>
[000184]    In  another  embodiment,   where  the  light  source provides light generally in the ultraviolet  range,  the total radiant  energy  flux  delivered  to  the  biological  fluid  may preferably  be  between  1-20  Joules/cm2  measured  across  a wavelength range of between approximately 320-400 nm.   In one specific embodiment, the total radiant energy flux delivered to blood platelets or blood plasma may be between approximately 1-5 J/cm2 and more typically approximately 3-4 J/cm3 measured across<br>
a  wavelength  range  of  between  approximately  320-400  nm. Preferably, the energy should not be outside the predetermined range  in  that  excess  heat  generated  within  fluid - treatment chamber 40 is to be avoided.   For light treatment of blood platelets  and  blood plasma,  for  example,  temperature within chamber 40 should typically not exceed 37 C.   If an external temperature sensor  of  the type described above is used,  the ambient temperature should be between 18-30 C.<br>
[000185]    During treatment, tray 90 is preferably agitated at a preset  frequency.   Of course,  the frequency should not be so great so as to harm the biological fluid or components thereof. Typically, the tray 90 may be agitated between approximately 40-100 cycles/min and for blood platelets, more preferably, between approximately 40-80 cycles/per minute.   A cycle is defined as one  complete  back  and  forth  oscillation  of  drawer  80. Additionally, it may be desirable for agitation may continue for up to 30 minutes after blood platelets have been treated with the desired target light dose, i.e., after illumination in the light box 10 is terminated.<br>
[000186]    Once treatment has been successfully completed, fluid from  container  206  may  be  transferred  to  container  210  by breaking frangible number 230b and opening the flow path between the containers  206 and 210  (Fig.  15) .   Once  inside container 210,  the biological fluid is allowed to contact the adsorbent material for a selected period of time.  As noted above, in one embodiment,  container 210 may also include time-sensitive tabs 209 that change color over time.   This way,  the operator will know if  the container has been in contact with the adsorbent material  for  the  appropriate  period  of  time.  The  adsorbent material is selected  to remove any residual photochemical agent or any by products of the photochemical process that may have been included in the biological fluid.   The adsorbent material may include polystyrene beads or activated charcoal or other adsorbent  material. Such materials are described in greater detail   in   International   Publication   No.   WO   96/40857, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
 [000187] Alternatively, in the disposable processing set 240 shown in Fig. 16, the biological fluid may simply pass-through container 246 without residing for any significant time, within the container. The details of the removal process and materials used are described in the above-identified International Publication No. WO96/40857.<br>
[000188]    The residence time, if any, of the biological fluid in container 210 (or 246) will be anywhere between approximately 30 seconds and 7 days.   In addition,  during contact of the biological fluid with the adsorbent material of container 210, it may be desirable to shake or otherwise agitate container 210 to ensure maximum contact with the adsorbent material. [000189]  . Regardless of which disposable set is used, after the required residence time,  if any,  the biological fluid may be transferred to container 214  (or 248  in Fig.  16)  by breaking frangible  member  230C  where  it  may  be  stored  prior  to transfusion  to a  recipient.   Label  216  (or  249)  applied  to storage  container  214   (or  248)   now  carries   identifying information regarding the donor and the fluid.  Masked bar codes 224  (or 251)  indicate  successful  treatment  of  the biological fluid  and  that  no  additional  treatment  is  required.    The container may be severed and sealed from the remaining portion of the disposable processing set as generally described above. [000190]    In  addition  to  the  treatment  function  generally described  above  and  as  generally  depicted  in  Fig.  22,  the control system may prompt the operator to perform other customer functions at steps 743, 744 and 744a, such as a system settings function at step 745 that allows the operator to set the date and time at step 748 and select the appropriate language at step 719.  The  control  system also  allows  the  operator  to  select certain container management functions such as auto-printing at step 751, a report printer at step 752, a label printer at step 7S3 or transmitting process reports to a data management system ar step 754.<br>
[000191]    Alternatively,  the  diagnostics  menu  755  shown  in general in Fig- 23 may be selected.  After waiting for the user<br>
to select an option at steps 756 and 756a, the user may select to see product data at step 757, initiate device tests at step 758,  access  service  information  at  step  760  or  initiate diagnostics at step 760.  It will be appreciated that steps 757-759 may have sub-options like diagnostics step 760.   Selecting diagnostics  option  760  permits  a  maintenance  person  or supervisor to enter new operator ID information at step 762 to permit new persons to be authorized to operate light box 10, to over-write  bag  records  at  step  763,  to  reset  lamp  life information,  as when lamps  are replaced,  at  step 764  and  to pri nt a maintenance log at step 765.<br>
[000192] It will be appreciated that various modifications of the embodiments and methods described herein may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
