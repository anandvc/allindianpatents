				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of cancer and other proliferate disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Extracellular signals received at transmembrane receptors are relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et a/., Science 257:1335 (1992)) which have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis (Davis et a/., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14553 (1993)). The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MARK) cascade is a major signaling system by which cells transduce extracellular cues into intracellular responses (Nishida et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:128 (1993); Blumer et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:236 (1994)). Many steps of this cascade are conserved, and homologous for MAP kinases have been discovered in different species.<br>
In mammalian cells, the Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERKs), ERK-1 and ERK-2 are the archetypal and best-studied members of the MAPK family, which all have the unique feature of being activated by<br>
phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an upstream dual specificity kinase (Posada et a/., Science 255:212 (1992); Biggs III et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6295 (1992); Garner et a/., Genes Dev. 6:1280 (1992)).<br>
Recent studies have identified an additional subgroup of MAPKs, known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK-1 and JNK-2), that have different substrate specificities and are regulated by different stimuli (Hibi et a/., Genes Dev. 7:2135 (1993)). JNKs are members of the class of stress-activated protein kinases (SPKs). JNKs have been shown to be activated by treatment of cells with UV radiation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress (Derij'ard et a/., Cell 1025 (1994)). The activated JNK binds to the amino terminus of the c-Jun protein and increases the protein's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it at ser63 and ser73 (Adler et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5341 (1992); Kwokera/., Nature 370:223 (1994)).<br>
Analysis of the deduced primary sequence of the JNKs indicates that they are distantly related to ERKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). Both ERKs and JNKs are phosphorylated on Tyr and Thr in response to external stimuli resulting in their activation (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). The phosphorylation (Thr and Tyr) sites, which play a critical role in their activation are conserved between ERKs and JNKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). However, these sites of phosphorylation are located within distinct dual phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNK) and Thr-Glu-Tyr (ERK). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and JNKs by an external signal often involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (Gille et a/., Nature 358:414 (1992)), which constitute a large family, of proteins encompassing several growth factor receptors and other signal transducing molecules.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well defined chemical reaction: the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Hunter et a/., Annu Rev Biochem 54:897 (1985)). Receptor tyrosine kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective and selective antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine kinase blockers as antiproliferative agents was<br><br>
recognized as early as 1981, when quercetin was suggested as a PTK blocker (Graziani et a/., Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MARK pathway involves extracellular signal-regulated kinases which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade (Boudewijn et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 20, 18 (1995)). Once this pathway is activated by different stimuli, MARK phosphorylates a variety of proteins including several transcription factors which translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this pathway could arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
What are needed are new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents which target receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. Oncoproteins in general, and signal transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more selective targets for chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are greatly amplified in proliferative diseases.<br>
What is also needed are new cell antiproliferative agents, and anticancer therapeutics in particular, which are highly selective in the killing of proliferating cells such as tumor cells, but not normal cells.<br>

Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the styryl sulfones of the present invention may block the phosphorylating capacity of ERK-2.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell death. The compounds are believed effective against a broad range of tumor types, including but not limited to the following: breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, colorectal, brain (i.e., glioma) and renal. .The compounds are. also believed effective against leukemic .cells. The compounds do not kill normal cells in concentrations at which tumor cells are killed.<br>
The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders, including but not limited to the following: hemangiomatosis in new born, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis, ganglioneuromatosis,<br><br>
keloid formation, Paget's disease of the bone, fibrocystic disease of the breast, Peyronie's fibrosis, and Dupuytren's fibrosis, restenosis and cirrhosis.<br>
Treatment of this broad range of tumor cells with the styryl benzylsulfone compounds of the invention leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death.<br>
Tumor cells treated with the compounds of the invention accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the G2/M phase, they appear to undergo apoptosis. Treatment of normal cells with the styryl sulfones does not result in apoptosis.<br>
(E)-Styryl benzylsulfones may be prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic aldehydes with benzylsulfonyl acetic acids. The procedure is described by Reddy et a/., Acta. Chim. Hung. 115:269-71 (1984); Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991); Reddy et a/., Synthesis No. 4, 322-323 (1984); and Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 7:43-48 (1987), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to the Scheme 1 below, Ra and Rb each represent from zero to five substituents on the depicted aromatic nucleus. The benzyl thioacetic acid B is formed by the reaction of sodium thioglycollate and a benzyl chloride A. The benzyl thioacetic acid B is then oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide to give a corresponding benzylsulfonyl acetic acid C. Condensation of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid C with an aromatic aldehyde D via a Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of benzylamine and glacial acetic acid yields the desired (E)-styryl benzylsulfone E.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing (E)-styryl benzylsulfones according to the above scheme.<br>
General Procedure 1: Synthesis (E)-Styryl benzylsulfones<br>
Part A. To a solution of (8g, 0.2 mol) sodium hydroxide in methanol (200 ml), thioglycollic acid (0.1 mol) is added slowly and the precipitate formed is dissolved by stirring the contents of the flask. Then an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted benzyl chloride (0.1 mol) is added stepwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The cooled contents are poured onto crushed ice and neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid (200 ml). The resulting corresponding benzylthioacetic acid (0.1 mol) is subjected to oxidation with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol) in glacial acetic acid (125 ml) by refluxing for 1 hour. The contents are cooled and poured onto crushed ice. The separated solid is recrystalized from hot water to give the corresponding pure benzylsulfonylacetic acid.<br>
Part B. A mixture of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid (10 mmol), an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted aromatic aldehyde (10 mmol), and benzylamine (200 ml) in glacial acetic acid (12 ml) is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The contents are cooled and treated with cold ether (50 ml). Any product precipitated out is separated by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with more ether and washed<br><br>
successively with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (20 ml), sodium bisulfite (20 ml), dilute hydrochloric acid (20 ml) and finally with water (35 ml). Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields styryl benzylsulfones as a solid material.<br>
According to an alternative to Part A, the appropriate benzylsulfonylacetic acids may be generated by substituting a thioglycollate HSChfeCOOR for thioglycollic acid, where R is an alkyl group, typically C1-C6 alkyl. This leads to the formation of the alkylbenzylthioacetate intermediate (F),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
which is then converted to the corresponding benzyl thioacetic acid B by alkaline or acid hydrolysis.<br>
(Z)-Styryl benzylsulfones are prepared by the nucleophilic addition of the appropriate thiol to substituted phenylacetylene with subsequent oxidation of the resulting sulfide by hydrogen peroxide to yield the Z-styryl benzylsulfone. The procedure is generally described by Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein as a reference.<br>
In the first phase of the synthesis, a substituted or unsubstitued sodium benzylthiolate, prepared from an appropriate substituted or unsubstitued sodium benzyl mercaptan, is allowed to react with the appropriate substituted , phenylacetylene forming the pure Z-isomer of the corresponding substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfide in good yield. In the second step of the synthesis, the substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfide intermediate is oxidized to the corresponding sulfone in the pure Z- isomeric form by treatment with an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing the substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfones. It may be appreciated that at<br><br>
least one of the starting styrene and sodium benzyl mercaptan are at least trisubstituted, in order to form compounds according to formula I.<br>
General Procedure 2: Synthesis of substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfones.<br>
A.	To a cooled stirred solution (40°C) of a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
styrene (0.5 mol) in chloroform (200 ml) is added dropwise a solution of bromine<br>
(0.5 mol) in chloroform (100 ml).  After the addition is complete, the contents of<br>
the flask are stirred for an additional 30 minutes.    Removal of chloroform in<br>
rotavapor yields a crystalline solid of a 1,2-dibromoaryl ethane.<br>
B.	A solution of potassium hydroxide (85 g) in rectified spirit (400 ml) is<br>
cooled to room temperature (25°C) and the above 1,2-dibromoaryl ethane (0.33<br>
mol) is added in portions to control the exothermic reaction. After the addition is<br>
complete, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours.  The contents are<br>
then cooled and poured into water (1000 ml).   The separated substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenylacetylene is purified either by distillation (in case of liquids) or<br>
recrystallization (In case of solids).<br>
C.	To a refluxing methanolic solution of a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
sodium benzylthiolate prepared from 460 mg (0.02g atom) of (i) sodium, (ii)<br>
substituted or unsubstituted sodium benzyl mercaptan (0.02 mol) and (iii) 80 ml of<br>
absolute methanol,  is added a freshly distilled substituted or unsubstituted<br>
phenylacetylene. The mixture is refluxed for 20 hours, cooled and then poured on<br>
crushed ice. The crude product is filtered, dried and recrystallized from methanol<br>
or aqueous methanol to yield pure substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfide.<br>
D.	An ice cold solution of a substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfide (3 g) in<br>
30 ml of glacial acetic acid is treated with 7.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The<br>
reaction mixture is refluxed for 1 hour and poured onto crushed ice.   The solid<br>
separated is filtered, dried and recrystallized from 2-propanol to yield a pure<br>
substituted (Z)-styryl benzylsulfone. The purity of the compound is ascertained by<br>
TLC and geometrical configuration is assigned by IR and NMR spectral data.<br>

Effect of (E)-Styryl Benzylsulfones on Tumor Cell Lines - Protocol 1<br>
A.       Cells.<br>
The effect of the (E)-styryl benzylsulfones on normal fibroblasts and on tumor cells of prostate, colon, lung and breast origin was examined utilizing the<br><br>
following cell lines: prostate tumor cell line DU-145; colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1; non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line H157; and breast tumor cell line BT-20. BT-20 is an estrogen-unresponsive cell line. NIH/3T3 and HFL are normal murine and human fibroblasts, respectively. BT-20, DLD-1 and H157 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. DU145 was cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin and streptomycin. NIH3T3 and HFL cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. All cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.<br>
B.       Treatment with Styryl Benzylsulfones and Viability Assay<br>
Cells were treated with test compound at 2.5 µM concentration and cell<br>
viability was determined after 96 hours by the Trypan blue exclusion method.<br>
Each compound tested (Exs. 1-16, 20, 21, 23-29, 31-33 and 35-40) showed<br>
activity, inducing cell death against all tumor cell lines, in at least 5-10% of the<br>
treated cells.<br>
Normal cells HFL and NIH 3T3 were treated with the same compounds<br>
under the same conditions of concentration and time. The normal cells displayed<br>
5% growth inhibition but no appreciable cell death.<br>
Effect of (Z)-Styryl Benzylsulfones on Tumor Cell Lines - Protocol 2<br>
In a variation of the above assay, the effect of the (Z)-styryl benzylsulfones on normal fibroblasts and on tumor cells may be demonstrated by the assay described by Latham ef. a/., Oncogens 12:827-837 (1996). Normal diploid lung human fibroblasts (HFL-1) or tumor cells (e.g., prostate, colo-rectal, breast, glial, pancreatic ovarian or leukemic) are plated in 6-well dishes at a cell density of 1.0 x 10s cells per 35-mm2 well. The plated cells are treated 24 hours later with various concentrations of styrylbenzylsulfone dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The total number of viable cells is determined 96 hours later by<br><br>
trypsinizing the wells and counting the number of viable cells, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, using a hemacytometer. Normal HFL are treated with the same compounds under the same conditions of concentration and time.<br>
