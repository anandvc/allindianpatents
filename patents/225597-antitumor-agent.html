This invention relates to a novel antitumor agent.<br>
More particularly, it relates to an antitumor agent comprising a stilbene derivative and a platinum coordination<br>
(coordinate) compound, such as Cisplatin, for example a chemotherapeutic drug (chemotherapy drug; chemotherapeutic agent) against cancers, to an antitumor agent comprising a stilbene derivative or a platinum coordination compound used therefor, and to uses of these effective ingredients for the treatment (therapy), suppression, amelioration (improvement) of tumors, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Nowadays, a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents are used for treatment, suppression and prevention of tumors,<br>
especially malignant solid tumors. Although these agents may have the tumor reducing effect, however , it is not possible for these known agents to release the pain of the patient from the tumors, due to acquisition of resistance against the agent, relapse of the tumors, and so on. Therefore, it is desired at present to develop further superior antitumor agents.<br>
Despite stilbene derivatives, having cis-stilbene as a<br><br>
fundamental skeleton, are known to exhibit strong mitosis inhibitory activities and cytotoxity,  these stilbene derivatives are as yet not available as a pharmaceutical agent by their low solubility in water.<br>
Recently, stilbene derivatives having the activity<br>
for inhibiting tubulin polymerization, especially phosphrylated pro-drug of Combretastatin-A4 (See US Patent 56122), having improved water solubility, and stilbene derivatives by the present Assignee (Japanese Patent Kokai Publications JP-A-7-228558 and JP-A-8-301831) have been proposed as a drug, and clinical use of these stilbene derivatives is felt to be promising.<br>
On the other hand, it is desired to improve the efficacy of these stilbene derivatives furthermore, in the aspects of antitumor activities and safety.<br>
OBJECT AND PRORT.EM OF THR TNVFNTTON<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a superior antitumor agent, specifically, to develop a pharmaceutical preparation capable of improving the efficacy of a stilbene derivative and, in particular, to develop and provide an antitumor agent exhibiting superior efficacy in both the antitumor activity and in safety in curing (treating) malignant tumors.<br>
HTSCT.OSURE OF INVENTION<br>
For overcoming the above problem and achieving the<br><br>
object, the present inventors have conducted perseverant researches, and have found that a stilbene derivative, administered together with a platinum coordination compound, such as Cisplatin, exhibits synergistic therapeutic effects to improve the tumor enhancement (tumor growth) inhibiting activities  of  the  platinum  coordination  compound effectively, however, the effect of the stilbene derivative is superior to those of other chemotherapeutic drugs and the platinum coordination compounds, such as Cisplatin, so that the stilbene derivative is a chemotherapeutic drug higher in efficacy to patients.   That is, by employing the stilbene derivatives in combination with platinum coordination compound, usable as the chemotherapeutic agents, especially Cisplatin, as a chemotherapeutic drug used in treating solid cancers, antitumor effects as well as safety may be exhibited synergistically towards fulfilment of the above-mentioned object and requirement from the problem. This finding has led to completion of the present invention-<br>
The process of arriving at the present invention is now explained in more detail.<br>
For finding a composition of a chemotherapeutic drug against cancer with higher efficacy, as may be demonstrated by improved efficacy against tumor grafted to a mouse, in connection with the composition containing Cisplatin as a chemotherpeutic drug used for curing (treating) various solid cancers (tumors), such as pulmonary cancer (lung cancer), the present inventors have conducted researches,<br><br>
using, as an index for achieving more promising clinical efficacy, the complete curing effect for mouse tumor and freeness from augmentative body weight decreasing action.<br>
As a result of these researches, the present inventors have found that, by combining a stilbene derivative, having preferably in-vitro tubulin polymerization inhibiting activities with a platinum coordination compound, it is possible to achieve a synergistic tumor complete curing effect and freeness from augmentative body weight decreasing action.<br>
Among currently known therapeutic agents, having the tubulin polymerization inhibiting activities as the main action, there are Vincristine, Vindesine, Vinblastine, etc. These agents are used for curing solid cancers in a multi-drug (polypharmacy) therapy, including Cisplatin, etc., in expectation of augmentation of the clinical efficacy.  However, in simultaneous administration of Vindesine and Cisplatin against mouse tumor, used for the present test, no tumor complete curing effect, as the reference for efficacy, has not been noted.  Therefore, the efficacy, that is the tumor complete curing effect, of the antitumor agent of the present invention, is thought to be the inherent (proper) action in the antitumor agent of the present invention.<br>
As for the safety (toxicity), no augmentative body weight decreasing effect, as may be noted in the composition containing Vindesine and Cisplatin, is noted in the<br><br>
composition containing the compound shown by the following structural formula (3):<br><br>
(3) and Cisplatin.<br>
From the above results, it has been clarified that the composition of the present invention is appreciably higher in efficacy for animals, especially human beings (patients), than the composition containing Cisplatin or solely other chemotherapeutic drug, and represents an antitumor agent, especially a cancer chemotherapy agent, possibly relieving the patient from the pains of tumor.  The present invention has been completed on the basis of these findings.<br>
That is,  the present invention is promising as providing a novel antitumor agent,  for example,  a chemotherapeutic drug against cancer (cancer chemotherapy agent), comprising simultaneously or separately two types of active ingredients, namely a stilbene derivative and a platinum coordination compound, such as Cisplatin.<br><br>

The prior art stilbene derivatives, described in these patent publications, can be used for the stilbene derivatives of the present invention, insofar as the prior art stilbene derivatives are in meeting with the above definition for the stilbene derivatives in the present invention. In addition, all the contents of the prior art patent publications are incorporated herein and therefore constitute a portion of the contents of the present specification.<br>
The above mentioned stilbene derivatives may be<br>
I)<br><br>
manufactured by the routine technique including the method disclosed in the above mentioned known publications. It is noted that stilbene derivative to be developed in future may be manufactured and used for the present invention in the same manner as described above.<br>
Among the stilbene derivatives of the present invention, there are salts, esters, and other derivatives of stilbene, and derivatives which may be converted in vivo into the stilbene derivatives, insofar as the stilbene derivatives manifest the above mentioned objective activities in an animal body.<br>

The platinum coordination compound used in the present invention is such a compound which gives a platinum preferably in an ionic form, and is also a compound<br><br>
exhibiting antitumor activity, more preferably a platinum coordination compound exhibiting tumor cell proliferation preventative (inhibiting) properties.<br>
Specified examples of the platinum coordination compounds, employed in the present invention, preferably include Cisplatin, cis-diamminediacoplatinum (II)-ion, chloro  (diethylene triamine)-platinum  (II)  chloride, dichloro (ethylene diamine)- platinum (II), diammine(1, 1-cyclobutane dicarboxylate) platinum (II) (carboplatin), spiroplatin,  iproplatin,  diammine  (2-ethylmalonate)-platinum (II), ethylene diammine malonate platinum (II), aqua (1, 2-diaminodichlohexane)-sulfate platinum (II),  (1, 2-diaminocyclohexane)  malonate  platinum  (II),   (4-caloxyphthalate)-(1, 2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum (II), (1, 2-diaminocyclohexane) - (isocitrate) platinum (ID,  (1, 2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis (pyruvate ) platinum (II), (1, 2-diaminocyclohexane)-oxalate platinum (II), Ormaplatin and tetraplatin.<br>
Certain explanations will be hereinafter made as to a platinum complex, included in the platinum coordination compound according to the present invention, as a chemotherapeutic drug.<br>
Cisplatin or cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II) has<br>
been successfully used for long as a chemotherapeutic drug in<br>
the therapy of various malignant tumors in the human being.<br>
More recently, other diamino-platinum complexes also have<br>
shown efficacy as the chemotherapeutic drugs in curing<br><br>
various malignant tumors in the human being. These diamino-platinum complexes may be enumerated by, for example, spiroplatinum and carboplatinum.<br>
Cisplatin and other diamino-platinum complexes have widely been used as the chemotherapeutic drugs in the human being. However, these are not therapeutically efficient for all patients or all sorts of tumors. In expectation of possible increase in efficacy, numerous attempts have been made towards using Cisplatin in combination with Vindesine by Garalla et al. (Garalla, R. J. et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 95, 414-420, 1980) or using Cisplatin in combination with VP-16 by Congeval et al. fCongeval, E. et al., Cancer, 51, 2751-2756, 1982). Although such combined application has achieved certain improvement in the efficacy ratio, it cannot be said that the pains of the patients by these tumors may be completely relieved by these measures.<br>
As the platinum coordination compounds used in the present invention, there are those compounds already known as the chemotherapeutic drugs (See Tamura, T. et al., Jpn J. Clin. Oncol, vol.18 (1). 27 (1988) and Fukuda, M. et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., vol.26,393 (1990).).<br>
It is necessary to increase the efficacy of the tumor prolifiration suppressing activity of Cisplatin and other diamino-platinum complexes in order to relieve the patient of the pain from the tumors.<br>
Among the platinum coordination compounds used for the present invention, Cisplatin, Carboplatin and Nedaplatin_<br><br>
are more desirable in their curative effects. Although the compound "Cisplatin", which means cis-dichloro diamine platinum (II), may be manufactured by prior art techniques, it may also be available commercially. For example, Cisplatin may be procured, as a powder for constituting with water, an aseptic physiological saline water or other suitable excipient, under the trade name of Platinol (Registered Trademark) from Bristol Myers-Squibb Co. or under the trade name of "randa inj." from NIPPON KAYAKUCO., LTD.<br>
Most of other platinum coordination compounds used in the present invention are commercially availabe or may be manufactured by known or routinely used techniques. Insofar as the platinum coordination compounds come within the definition therefor of the present invention, these may be manufactured or acquired by manufacturing methods which will be developed in future.<br>
When the antitumor agent of the present invention is to be used, stilbene derivatives in an amount sufficient to inhibit tumor proliferation may be combined with platinum coordination compounds, and administered to the subject, an animal, especially a human being,  in need of curing, alleviation or prevention of tumors, especially a human being suffering from proliferation of tumor cells, to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in the human being. In this case as described above, the two t/pes of such efficacious ingredients in the present invention may be<br><br>
contained in combination in a pharmaceutical preparation, and however,  such an each combined pharmaceutical preparation  obtained  on  combining  two  different preparations containing one of the two type of efficacious ingredients in the present invention to realize the objective antitumor agent, is encompassed by the present invention.   Moreover,  a  pharmaceutical  preparation containing one of the two efficacious ingredients is also encompassed  by  the  present  invention,  if  such pharmaceutical preparation has the objective of being used in combination with the pharmaceutical preparation containing the other efficacious ingredient in the present invention.<br>
One of the preferred embodiments in the present invention is to use the compound (3) in an amount effective to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells in combination with cisplatin to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells.<br>
The inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells means inhibition of proliferation of the tumor cells sensitive to therapy including administration of an effective amount of the stilbene derivatives, such as the compound (3) , and the platinum coordination compounds, such as cisplatin, to e.g., a human being suffering from proliferation of tumor cells.<br>
In an acceptable case, this administration suppresses proliferation of tumor cells or diminishes the measurable size of the tumors.    In an optimum case, the tumor undergoes regression completely.<br><br>
As described above, there is no particular limitation to the method of administering the antitumor agent of the present invention to the human being, such that it may be administered orally or parenterally, such as by intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular route. For prompt efficacy, parenteral administration, such as by intravenous and subcutaneous administration, by infusion, etc. is preferred. In the method for administering the pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention,  the stilbene derivative may be administered simultaneously with the platinum coordination compound or the two may be sequentially administered in an optional order.  The practically  desirable  method  and  sequence  for administration are varied depending on the individual preparation of the stilbene derivative used, such as the compound (3), individual preparation of the platinum coordination compound in use, such as Cisplatin, individual tumor cells being cured, and the individual hosts being treated. The optimum method and sequence for administration of the stilbene derivative and the platinum coordination compound under preset given conditions may be suitably selected by those skilled in the art with the aid of the routine technique and the information contained in the present specification.<br>
An efficacious tumor proliferation inhibiting amount of the stilbene derivative and the platinum coordination compound means a curative unit inhibiting proliferation of<br><br>
the tumor cells sensitive to administration in the human being suffering from proliferation of tumor cells. The practically desirable curative unit is varied depending on the individual dosage forms of the stilbene derivative used, such as the compound (3), individual dosage forms of the platinum coordination compound uses, such as Cisplatin, individual tumor cells being cured and the individual hosts being treated. The optimum curative units for preset given conditions may be suitably selected by those skilled in the art with the aid of the curative test units and the information contained in the present specification.<br>
When administering the antitumor agent of the present invention, the administration schedule for the platinum coordination compound is preferably determined by setting approximately 1 to 500 mg/rrr of the body surface area per curative unit as a reference. When using Cisplatin and the compound (3) , these may be administered simultaneously, Cisplatin is administered prior to administration of the compound (3)(later administration of the compound (3)), or the compound (3) is administered prior to administration of Cisplatin   (later   administration   of   Cisplatin). Alternatively, these methods may be used in combination. As for the preferred amount of administration of Cisplatin, approximately 10 to 100 mg/nr of the body surface area per day<br>
of Cisplatin is preferably administered simultaneously in curative units of the compound (3) each of continuous one to five days on end. The platinum coordination compound in an<br><br>
infusion form is preferably infused once or twice a week.<br>
This weekly infusion is preferably repeated several times insofar as the undesirable side effect actions such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity give rise to a taboo. It is possible to use other conventionally used techniques simultaneously with the administration of the platinum compound, such as Cisplatin or the other platinum coordination compound.<br>
The antitumor agent of the present invention is sufficient to be a pharmaceutical preparation comprising at least the stilbene derivative and the platinum coordination compound as described above, such that the two act ive ingredients may be contained as a mixture in the pharmaceutical preparation.   However, the two active ingredients in the present invention may also be contained separately in distinct pharmaceutical preparations used in combination.   It is noted that such a pharmaceutical preparation containing other agents (third and fourth medical ingredients and so on) such as other antitumor agents, may naturally be encompassed by the present invention, insofar as the effective ingredients used in the present invention are contained in the pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Moreover, it is possible for carriers, diluents and other substances, pharmaceutically acceptable for any of the pharmaceutical preparations in the present invention (a sole  pharmaceutical  preparation  containing  both ingredients  in the present  invention and separate<br><br>
pharmaceutical preparations separately each containing one of the two ingredients for use in combination) to be contained in the antitumor agent of the present invention.<br>
As the suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents, used in the antitumor agent of the present invention, those carriers etc known to those skilled in the art of preparation of pharmaceutical preparations, may be used as appropriate (See, for example, Japanese Patent Kokai Publication JP-A-8-301831 and the other aforementioned prior art publications. ) . The antitumor agent of the present invention may be suitably applied parenterally, as discussed above. In this case, the antitumor agent is prepared into an intravenous infusion or injection, along with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers by variable methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the pharmaceutical agent is manufactured by a routine technique in e. g., a unit dosage form and in the form of a freeze-dried mixture of two effective ingredients, and is re-prepared in water or other suitable liquid infusion in administration.<br>
The ratio of the two ingredients for the pharmaceutical preparation for the antitumor agent of the present invention may be varied in a wide range, depending on a number of factors, such as a desired amount of administration and on the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in use. As for the amounts or combination in administering the stilbene derivative in the pharmaceutical preparation as the antitumor agent of the present invention, the stilbene<br><br>
derivative of approximately 0.01 to 1000 and, in particular, approximately 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of the stilbene derivative, to 1 part by weight of the platinum coordination compound present in the pharmaceutical preparation as the antitumor agent of the present invention, are preferably employed. So, when the pharmaceutical preparation in the present invention containing two active ingredients is to be administered to the patient, it is administered in an amount which will give the above-defined administration range.<br>
If the pharmaceutical preparation is to be administered stepwise, the above-defined administration range can be set as the average ratio for the separate pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Preferably, 5 to 500 mg of the platinum coordination compound, more preferably 10 to 50 mg as Cisplatin, 0.1 to 10,000 mg of the stilbene derivative and more preferably 1 to 1,000 mg as the compound (3) may be contained for each dosage of the pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention. It is desirable that mannitol and/or sodium chloride be contained in routine amounts in the pharmaceutical preparation of Cisplatin. The physiological pharmaceutical value of the pharmaceutical composition used as an injection or infusion liquid is suitably adjusted by the content of a buffer well-known in the art.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>

(Test on Efficacy in Mice (Test on Antitumor Activity and Safety))<br>
10 mg of a colonic tumor of mouse, colon 26 was inoculated under the skin of the back of CDF1 mice (day 0) .<br>
After one week, the tumor was measured to calculate the volume of the tumor and the mice were classified into several groups (each group ;n = 5) . Injection of the pharmaceutical preparation was started. The compound (3) ( 1 mg of hydrochloride in 1 ml of physiological saline water) and cisplatin ( 0 . 5 mg of Cisplatin in 1 ml of "randa Inj .") were bolusly injected under the skin of the back and into the tail vein on the 7th, 11th and 15th days.<br><br>
The individual in which the tumor has not been ascertained by palpation on the 60th day was deemed to have its tumor cured completely. The results are shown in Table 1-<br>
The "VP-16" is a chemotherapeutic drug which is often used clinically in combination with Cisplatin. [+CDDPJ means that Cisplatin was administered in an amount of 5 mg/kg/day and [-CDDP] means that Cisplatin was not administered at all. [n.d.] means that the test was not carried out. Meanwhile, the dosages of Cisplatin, VP-16 and Vindesine represent the maximum dosage without death due to the toxicity in the administration schedule in the present example.<br>
By the following equation, the rate of body weight change at the 21st day was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Rate of body weight change (%) = [( (body weight - weight of the tumor] at the 21st day} - { (body weight - weight of the tumor) at the 7th day }]/{ (body weight - weight of the tumor) at the 7th day} x 100<br><br><br>
As clearly shown in the results of table 1, the antitumor agent of the present invention, that is the combination of the stilbene derivative and the platinum<br><br>
coordination compound, was improved as to synergistic pharmaceutical activity, especially in the effect of complete regression of tumors , as compared to a pharmaceutical preparation composed of any one of two ingredients.<br>
On the other hand, in the pharmaceutical preparation, used clinically in combination with Cisplatin, such as Vindesine or VP-16, the complete regression of tumor was not observed.<br>
Concerning the safety aspect, undesirable loss of body weight, such as is noted in the combination of Vindesine or VP-16 with the platinum coordination compound, was not observed in the combination of the two ingredients of the present invention, as clearly shown in the results of Table 2.<br>
(Example 2) Antitumor Effect and Test on Safety 2<br>
(Preparation of Pharmaceutical preparation)<br>
Pharmaceutical  preparations  for  infusion  were prepared in accordance with the following composition using the compounds (4) and (5), shown by the following chemical formulas as the stilbene derivatives:<br><br><br><br>
compound (4) (as hydrochloride)	5 mg;<br>
Tween 80	0.5 ml; and<br>
physiological saline water	9.5 ml.<br>
compound (5)(as hydrochloride)	10 mg;<br>
Tween 80	0.5 ml; and<br>
physiological saline water	9.5 ml.<br>
As in Example 1 as described above, the pharmaceutical preparation ["randa Inj."] marketed by NIPPON KAYAKU CO., LTD. (containing 0.5 mg of Cisplatin in 1 ml solution) and the pharmaceutical preparation ["paraplatin injection"] marketed by Bristol Myers-Squibb Co. (containing 10 mg of Carboplatin in 1 ml) were used as the Cisplatin and as Carboplatin, respectively.<br>
(Test on Efficacy in Mice [Test on Antitumor Activity and Safety]<br>
10 mg of a colonic tumor of mouse, colon 26 was inoculated under the skin of the back of CDF1 mice (day 0) .<br><br>
After one week, the tumor was measured to calculate the volume of the tumor and the mice were classified into several groups (each group ;n = 5) . Injection of the pharmaceutical preparation was started.<br>
The compounds (3) to (5), Cisplatin and Carboplatin were bolusly injected into the tail vein on the 7th, 11th and 15th days.<br>
The individual in which the tumor has not been ascertained by palpation on the 60th day was deemed to have its tumor cured completely. The results were shown in Tables 3 and 4.<br>
[+CBDCA] and [+CDDP] means that 50 mg/kg/day of carboplatin and 5 mg/kg/day of cisplatin were administered, respectively, whilst [-CBDCA] and [-CDDP] means no administration of catboplatin and cisplatin. Meanwhile, the dosages of cisplatin and carboplatin denote the maximum dosages without death due to toxicity in the administration<br>
schedule in the present embodiment.<br>
The rate of body weight change at the 21st day was calculated in accordance with the equation used in the Example 1. The results are shown in tables 5 and 6.<br><br><br><br><br>
As clearly shown in the results of Tables 3 and 4, the antitumor agent of the present invention exhibits superior antitumor activity by employing the stilbene derivative and the platinum coordination compound in combination.<br>
Moreover, concerning the safety aspect, as clearly shown in the results of Tables 5 and 6, outstanding improvement may be noticed by employing the two ingredients of the present invention.<br>
Finally, it may be seen from the results of Tables 1 to 6 that, with the combination of the stilbene derivative and the platinum coordination compound according to the present invention, the efficacy as the antitumor agent is improved synergistically beyond the expectation by those skilled in the art, such that a practically highly useful antitumor effect can be achieved.<br><br>
EFFECTS OF INVF.NTTON<br>
The antitumor agent according to the present invention, comprising a stilbene derivative and a platinum coordination compound, such as Cisplatin, in combination or as a mixture, can be used as an antitumor agent, especially as a cancer chemotherapeutic drug (cancer chemotherapy drug; chemotherapeutic agent), which may be highly effective as curing (treatment), suppression and prevention of tumors, especially solid cancer (solid carcinoma) , due to the synergistic effect derived from the combination of two types of the efficacious ingredients.<br>
It is therefore possible to use these two types of the active ingredients for therapy (treatment), suppression, amelioration (improvement) of such tumors.<br><br><br>
