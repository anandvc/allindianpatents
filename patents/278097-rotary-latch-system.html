ROTARY PAWL LATCH<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
51.	Field of Invention<br>
		The present invention relates to the field of latch assemblies.<br>
	2.	Brief Description of the Related Art<br>
		Latch assemblies are relied on in many applications for securing items, such as<br>
	panels together. An important use for latches is in the automotive field, where there is<br>
10	a desire and need to access automotive compartments, such as, for example,<br>
	passenger compartments of vehicles. Various latches for panel closures have been<br>
	employed where one of the panels such as a swinging door or the like is to be fastened<br>
	or secured to a stationary panel, doorframe, or compartment body. Although many<br>
	latch assemblies are known in the prior art. none are seen to teach or suggest the<br>
15	unique features of the present invention or to achieve the advantages of the present<br>
	invention.<br>
		Thus it will be understood that the latch components used to date have presented<br>
	a number of drawbacks that typically have left the securing of a striker of a panel more<br>
	awkward, time-consuming and difficult to install, remove, open, close, latch, and unlatch.<br>
20	ln some instances, the selected latch, lock and hinge components have provided shorter<br>
	than desired service lives and/or a lesser than the desired degree of security by virtue<br>
	of their being relatively simple to defeat, force, break or bypass. In some instances the<br>
	latch, lock and hinge components have been too weak to withstand the forces that have<br>
	been encountered during normal service use (e.g., damage or unintended release has<br>
25	been noted as the result of these components being impacted by cargo that shifts as a<br>
	pickup truck travels from place to place), or these components have taken on such size<br>
	and bulk as to project into regions of cargo compartments that should be reserved for<br>
	cargo<br>
		Rotary latches capture a striker in two axes by rotation of a pawl which is activated<br>
30	by a trigger. There may be freedom of movement between the latch and the striker along<br>
		 <br>
10<br>
		-2-<br>
	the axis of the striker which may be cylindrical. This allows for manufacturing tolerance in<br>
	the fit between the frame or first member to which the latch is mounted and the door or<br>
	other second member to which the striker is mounted. In addition, difficulties have been<br>
	encountered when a striker to which a latch such as a rotary latch is to be secured is off-<br>
5	center with respect to being aligned with a catch for engagement with the striker. There<br>
	are instances when it is not practical to insure that tight tolerances will be maintained in<br>
	door or frames such that the striker will always fall into the notch or mouth of the latch.<br>
	The reason for misalignment between the latch and striker can be manufacturing and<br>
	assembly tolerances, expansion and contraction of the structure due to environmental<br>
10	conditions, shifting of components due to wear during use or distortion of components due<br>
	to abuse.<br>
	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15		The invention addresses the foregoing and other needs and drawbacks of the<br>
	prior art by providing a latch that is particularly well suited for engaging strikers which<br>
	are off-center, characterized by novel features that also have other applications.<br>
		In accordance with another aspect of the preferred practice of the present<br>
	invention, a rotary latch is provided to releasably latch strikers connected to a door or<br>
20	panel. The housings of these latch may be modified as needed to provide mounting<br>
	surfaces that carry slotted holes or other mounting formations that can cooperate with<br>
	mounting hardware such as threaded fasteners to mount the rotary latch in a manner<br>
	that will allow for adjustment of the positioning of the latch so the latch will function<br>
	property. A trigger of the rotary latch of the present invention can be operated by a user,<br>
25	a rod, a cable or another member.<br>
		The striker assembly of the present invention allows for movement or float of the<br>
	striker in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the striker. Further, the bolt of the<br>
	striker assembly is urged to return to the center position when the striker is released<br>
	from the latch. This centering position is desired so that the striker will be in position to<br>
		 <br>
15<br>
-3-<br>
	engage the latch during the next engagement of the striker with the latch even if the<br>
	striker and latch do not line up exactly for engagement.<br>
		The present invention is directed to a rotary latch system for securing the latch to<br>
	a striker. The present invention includes a housing, a rotary pawl, an actuator, and a<br>
	srigger means for releasing a striker when the latch is in a closed configuration. The<br>
	pawl is pivotally attached to the housing and is rotationally movable between a closed<br>
	or engaged configuration and an open or disengaged configuration, The latch can also<br>
	have an intermediate position in which a striker can be held by the engagement of the<br>
	rotary pawl with the actuating means both of which can be provided with a biasing<br>
10	means.<br>
		When a striker engages a portion of the roiary pawl the pawl is rotated such that<br>
	pawl teeth engage actuator teeth. The teeth can be dimensioned and configured such<br>
	that an intermediate engaging position is attained by the latch and the striker is held in<br>
	position or if more force is applied a closed or latch configuration is achieved in which<br>
15	the striker will not be released from the latch until the trigger releases the pawl.<br>
		The rotary pawl can be made from three joinable plates for ease of assembly. In<br>
	such a configuration, a striker engagement portion of a protuberance of the rotary pawl<br>
	which can be made from one plate sweeps an arc which extends further than an<br>
	actuator engagement portion of the rotary pawl which can be made from two plates<br>
20	which are joinable. The plates can be joined by studs on the plates which fit up to<br>
	depressions on an adjoining plate. Because striker engagement portion of the<br>
	protuberance extends further than the actuator engagement portion of the pawl, the<br>
	latch of the present invention can be of a smaller size as compared to other rotary<br>
	latches because the pawl teeth can be closet to the pawl pivot point.<br>
25		The latch of the present invention also has the advantage that the latch can have<br>
	a single housing side plate which can be fitted interchangeably with the pawl on one<br>
	side of the housing and the actuator on the other side of the housing.<br>

10	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTJON<br>
		Referring to Figs. 1-17, a latch 100 made in accordance with the present<br>
	invention can be seen. The latch 100 includes a latch housing 104 as seen in Fig. 1, a<br>
	pawl 140. an actuator 138, and trigger means 142 for selectively moving the latch 100<br>
15	from the closed position in which the latch 100 can be engaging a striker 88. In the<br>
	illustrated embodiment, trigger 142 is shown in the form of a fever which pivots about<br>
	trigger pivot means 42 for selectively moving actuator 138 which is acted upon by<br>
	actuator biasing means 38. Actuator biasing means 38, here a spiral spring has spring<br>
	leg 38a which engages housing 104 and spring leg 38b which engages cutout 105 in<br>
20	the housing 104. Similarly, pawl biasing means 40, here a spiral spring has spring leg<br>
	40a which engages housing 104 and spring leg 40b which engages pawl spring<br>
	engagement means 41 on pawl 140. Pawl biasing means 40 biases the pawl 140 to<br>
	the open position while the actuator biasing means 38 biases the actuator 138 in the<br>
	clockwise direction as seen in Fig. 2.<br>
25		As seen in Fig. 10, as a striker 88 engages the striker engagement portion 145 of<br>
	the pawl 140. the pawl 140 rotates such that paw! teeth 146 engage actuator teeth 147.<br>
	In Fig. 11r the pawl 140 and actuator 138 are engaged by pawl teeth 146 and actuator<br>
	teeth 147 such that the latch 100 is in an intermediate closed position in which the<br>
	striker 88 is captured. Further movement as seen in Fig. 12 of the striker 88 results in<br>
		 <br>
40<br>
		-7-<br>
	one of pawl teeth 146 moving past one of actuator teeth 147 such that the latch 100<br>
	attains a closed position as seen in Fig. 13.<br>
		The housing 104 as seen in Fig. 18 has notch 2 for engagement with a striker 88<br>
	and also has apertures 4 and 6 which receive pawl rivet 10 and actuator rivet 8. As<br>
