COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
GRANULES<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
GRANULES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the reduction in migration of actives from granules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Powder detergents for clothes washing are formulated at high pH and often contain percarbonate or perborate as a bleach. To give additional benefits to the washer, high performance organic chemicals (HPOCs) such as anti-oxidants, shading dyes and shading pigments may be added to the formulation. These compounds are frequently chemically unstable to high pH and bleach, so that on storage they are destroyed. To prevent this, they may be segregated from the formulation, by adding them to the formulation in separate post-dosed granules.  An acidic polymer may be added to the granule used to increase stability as described in WO2007/039042 (Unilever).<br>
It is advantageous to use non-ionic surfactants in such granules, to initially mix the HPOC's in and to aid dispersion and delivery of the ingredients in the wash, as described in WO2006/053598 (Unilever). This is especially the case when the HPOC's are hydrophobic materials.<br><br>
Under storage conditions in powder detergents at high temperature and humidity the non-ionic containing granules, leach non-ionic over the whole formulation, again exposing the HPOC's to high pH and bleach.  The problem is particularly severe in powder detergent formulations that contain high levels of non-ionic surfactant.  The leaching from the granule can also lead to powder discolouration, especially for dyes and pigments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have found that granules of the present invention provide reduced bleeding of HPOC.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides a granule comprising:<br>
(i) from 5 to 30 wt% of a non-ionic surfactant having mixed therein between 0.00001 to 5% wt % of a high performance organic compound selected from the group consisting of dye, pigment, and antioxidant<br>
(ii) from 20 to 90 wt% of silica; and,<br>
(iii) from 20 to 60 wt% of a binder that is other than a non-ionic surfactant,<br>
wherein the fraction (wt% binder)/(wt% non-ionic) is greater then 1, preferably greater than 2 most preferably greater than 2.5.<br>

NON-IONIC SURFACTANT<br>
Preferred non-ionic surfactants are, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated alkyl phenols, anhydrosorbitols, and alkoxylated anhydrosorbitol esters. An example of a preferred nonionic surfactant is a polyethoxylated alcohol manufactured and marketed by the Shell Chemical Company under the trademark "Neodol". Examples of preferred Neodols are Neodol 25-7 which is a mixture of 12 to 15 carbon chain length alcohols with about 7 ethylene oxide groups per molecule; Neodol 23-65, a C12-13 mixture with about 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide; Neodol 25-9, a C12-13 mixture with about 9 moles of ethylene oxide; and Neodol 45-7, a C14-15 mixture with about seven moles of ethylene oxide.

SILICA<br>
Preferably, the silica has a pore volume of from 0.2 to 2.5 ml/g, most preferably 1.2 to 2 ml/g. The pore volume is measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry or water saturation method at 293K.  The water saturation method is preferred; here a known weight of the silica is slowly mixed with a known volume of water, such that excess water is present. The container is sealed and left till the silica becomes fully saturated (i.e. all pores are filled). The excess water is then removed and the volume measured. Pore volume is then given by the equation:<br>
(pore volume) - [ (total volume of water) - (excess water)]/weight of silica.<br>
The pore volume served to provide cavities into which the non-ionic/HPOC migrates during application.<br>
Preferably, the silica has an average particle size, APS, from 0.1 to 100 microns, preferably 1 to 15 microns. Preferably this is as measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyser, preferably a Malvern HP with 100mm lens.<br>
For general discussion of the measurement of particle size see OECD 110 and EUR 20268 EN(2002).<br>
Preferably the silica is a neutral or acidic silica.<br><br>
Preferably the silica is amorphous.<br>
Preferably the silica is without a wax surface treatment. This permits ready delivery of the HPOCs to the wash medium.<br>
BINDER<br>
A binder is a material used to bind together two or more other materials in mixtures.  Its two principal properties are adhesion and cohesion. The binder is other than a non-ionic surfactant. Binders are standard in the art of laundry detergent granules, examples of which are: Sokalan® CP45, Sokalan® CP5, ethylene glycol, surfactants, anionic surfactants, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates/ citric acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, tfte binder has a melting point above 30°C.<br>
Preferably the binder is selected from the group consisting of a polyacrylate, polyethylene glycol, and polyacrylate/maleate copolymer.<br>
The binder may serve as a coating agent and a cogranulent for the silica particles.<br>
Suitable polymers for use herein are water-soluble. By water-soluble, it is meant herein that the polymers have a solubility greater than 5 g/1 at 20 °C in demineralised water.<br>
The binder is preferably an acidic polymer. By an acidic polymer, it is meant herein that a 1% solution of said polymers has a pH of less than 7, preferably less than 5.5.<br><br>
Suitable polymers for use herein have a molecular weight in the range of from 1000 to 280,000, preferably from 1500 to 150,000.<br>
Suitable polymers which meet the above criteria and are therefore particularly useful in the present invention, include those having the following empirical formula I<br><br>
wherein X is 0 or CH2; Y is a comonomer or comonomer mixture; Rl and R2 are bleach-stable polymer-end groups; R3 is H, OH or Cl-4 alkyl; M is H, and mixtures thereof with alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium; p is from 0 to 2; and n is at least 10, and mixtures thereof. The proportion of M being H in such polymers is preferably such as to ensure that the polymer is sufficiently acidic to meet the acidity criteria as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Polymers according to formula I are known in the field of laundry detergents, and are typically used as chelating agents, as for instance in GB-A-1,597,756.  Preferred polycarboxylate polymers fall into several categories. A first category belongs to the class of copolymeric polycarboxylate polymers which, formally at least, are formed from an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid such as maleic acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid and mesaconic<br><br>
acid as first monomer, and an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid such as acrylic acid or an alpha -C1-C4 alkyl acrylic acid as second monomer. Referring to formula I, therefore, preferred polycarboxylate polymers of this type are those in which X is CHO, R3 is H or Cl-4 alkyl, especially methyl, p is from about 0.1 to about 1.9, preferably from about 0.2 to about 1.5, n averages from about 10 to about 1500, preferably from about 50 to about 1000, more preferably from 100 to 800, especially from 120 to 400 and Y comprises monomer units of formula II<br><br>

GRANULE<br>
The granule is preferably of the size from 250 to 1400 microns. The granule size is as determined by passing through a mesh sieve. Preferably the size is in the range...<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
The dye solvent violet 13 was mixed in non-ionic surfactant (7EO) to form a 0.5 wt% solution.<br>
The non-ionic was added to the carrier in a high shear mixer. Following this the binder was added to granulate the mixture. There resultant granules were dried in an oven at 353K finally sieved to give granules in the size range 500 to 1000 microns.<br>
The granules had the following composition. All percentages refer to weight.<br><br>
		Carrier	Non-ionic containing 0.5 wt% dye	Binder<br>
Granule	1	37% gasil 230	16	47% CP5<br>
Granule	2	68% gasil 200TP	27	5% CP13<br>
Granule	3	64% gasil 200TP	26	10% CP5<br>
Granule	4	60% gasil 200 DF	34	16% CP5<br>
Granule	5	71% bentonite	17	12% CP5<br><br>
Gasil 230 is a neutral silica with an APS of 3.6 microns and a pore volume of 1.6 ml/g.<br>
Gasil 200DF is an acidic silica with an APS of 4.3 microns and a pore volume of 0.4 ml/g. Gasil 200TP is similar to Gasil 200DF.<br>
Example 2 Bleeding tests<br>
The granules of example 1 were added to detergent powders of the following formulations, so that the powder contained 0.01 wt% solvent violet 13. The powders were stored in open cups at 310 K, and 70% Relative humidity for 1 month.<br>
Formulation (1) surfactant system: 18% sodium LAS. Builder system: 28% Sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium carbonate and sodium disilicate. Bleach system: none.  Remainder sodium sulphate.<br>
Formulation (2) surfactant system: 7% sodium LAS, 3% non-ionic (7EO). Builder system: 45% Sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium disilicate. Bleach system: none. Remainder sodium sulphate.<br>
Formulation (3) surfactant system: 10% sodium LAS, 5% non-ionic (7EO). Builder system: 35% zeolite 4A, sodium carbonate, Bleach systems 16% sodium percarbonate and TAED. Remainder sodium sulphate.<br>
After storage the powders were visually inspected for bleeding and compared to fresh powders.  The results are given in the table below.<br><br>
			Formulation	<br><br>
	(1)	(2)	(3)<br>
Granule	1	No bleeding	No bleeding	No bleeding1<br>
Granule	2	Low level bleeding	Bleeding	No bleeding1<br>
Granule	3	Bleeding	Bleeding	No bleeding*<br>
Granule	4	Bleeding	Bleeding	No bleeding1<br>
Granule	5	No bleeding	Bleeding	White2<br>
1	blue coloured granules still observed in powder<br>
2	no coloured granules observed in powder after storage<br>
Granule 1 the silica granule with high level of CP5 gave the best overall performance.<br>
The disappearance of colour in granule 4 indicates that the dye is destroyed over time by the bleach present in the formulation.<br>
Performance test showed that some dye was also destroyed in formulation (3) with time, this was least with, granule (2) with the acidic binder CP13.<br>
No dye losses were seen from formulation (1) and (2) for any of the granules.<br><br>
