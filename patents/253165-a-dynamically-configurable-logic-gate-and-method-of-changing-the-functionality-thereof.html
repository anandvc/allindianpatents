				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the field of dynamic computing and, more particularly, to<br>
a chaotic computing architecture for logic gates.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Conventional computing systems rely upon timed operations and Boolean algebra<br>
to perform calculations. That is, the flow and processing of signals within conventional<br>
computing systems is under the control and coordination of a timing source such as a signal<br>
from a system clock. With the passing of each clock cycle, signals can be processed,<br>
typically using various combinations of logic gates to implement one or more Boolean<br>
algebraic functions.<br>
[0003] Conventional computing systems also are static in nature and lack a flexible<br>
computing architecture. Within static computing systems, the various hardware components<br>
of the computing system cannot be reconnected or reconfigured during operation. For<br>
example, the functionality of hardware components such as logic gates cannot be changed<br>
once the component is fabricated. Moreover, once a plurality of components or logic gates<br>
are organized to form a data processing system or particular Boolean function, the<br>
components become fixed in circuitry. This is the case whether the function is implemented<br>
as a series of discrete components or on a silicon chip. In either case, the structure of the<br>
resulting circuit cannot be reconfigured or reordered into a different design.<br>
[0004] Some computing modules, however, can be reconfigured to a limited degree. For<br>
example, field programmable gate arrays provide a limited degree of flexibility with respect<br>
to reconfiguration. One class of FPGA, referred to as a one-time configurable architecture,<br>
can be programmed one time by using fuses and antifuses as switches to make or break<br>
circuit connections. Another class of FPGA, referred to as a multi-time configurable<br>
architecture, can be adjusted to implement different architecture configurations each time the<br>
device is used.<br>
[0005] Still another class of FPGA allows for hardware to evolve during the course of<br>
operation of a design. Such FPGA's are referred to as having dynamic architectures, and<br>
more specifically as having dynamic rewire architectures. For example, conventional<br><br><br>
dynamic FPGA's can include uncommitted logic cells and routing resources whose functions<br>
and interconnections are determined by user-defined configuration data stored in static<br>
random access memory (RAM). The static RAM can be modified at run-time, thereby<br>
allowing the configuration for some part of the chip to be altered while other circuits operate<br>
without interruption. Other embodiments include microcontrollers which allow for rerouting<br>
of data within the FPGA.<br>
[0006] In any case, while the present state of electronic design has begun to develop<br>
dynamic computing architectures, such efforts have been limited to simply redirecting signal<br>
flows or "rewiring" devices or components such as FPGA's.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The inventive arrangements disclosed herein provide a method, system, and<br>
apparatus for emulating different logic gates. Using a control mechanism, the present<br>
invention can emulate the functionality of any one of several different logic gates. For<br>
example, a given logic gate structure can function as one type of logic gate and then begin<br>
functioning as a different type of logic gate during operation. Accordingly, the inventive<br>
arrangements disclosed herein can be combined to form more complex systems. Notably, not<br>
only can the functionality of the different individual gate structures be changed dynamically<br>
during operation, but the functionality of the larger system also can be changed.<br>
[0008] One aspect of the present invention can include a dynamically configurable logic<br>
gate. The logic gate can include a controller configured to provide a first threshold reference<br>
signal and an adder configured to sum the first threshold reference signal and at least one<br>
input signal to generate a summed signal. The logic gate further can include a chaotic<br>
updater configured to apply a nonlinear function to the summed signal and a subtractor<br>
configured to determine an output signal by taking a difference between a second threshold<br>
reference signal and the processed summed signal from the chaotic updater. The logic gate<br>
can operate as one of several different logic gates responsive to adjusting at least one of the<br>
threshold reference signals.<br>
[0009] For example, one or more of the reference signals can be adjusted so that the logic<br>
gate operates as an "and" (AND) logic gate. Still, one or more of the reference signals can be<br>
adjusted such that the logic gate operates as an "or" (OR) logic gate, an "exclusive or" (XOR)<br>
logic gate, or a "not" (NOT) logic gate. The difference signal determined by the subtractor<br>
can serve as the output signal of the logic gate.<br><br><br>
[0010] Another aspect of the present invention can include a method of changing the<br>
functionality of a dynamically configurable logic gate. The method can include generating a<br>
first threshold reference signal and adding the first threshold reference signal and at least one<br>
input signal to generate a summed signal. A nonlinear function can be applied to the summed<br>
signal. A difference can be taken between a second threshold reference signal and the<br>
processed summed signal. The operation of the logic gate can be changed to function as one<br>
of several different logic gates responsive to adjusting at least one of the threshold reference<br>
signals.<br>
[0011] For example, the operation of the logic gate can be altered to function as an AND<br>
logic gate, an OR logic gate, an XOR logic gate, or a NOT logic gate. The difference signal<br>
can be the output of the logic gate.<br>
[0012] Yet another aspect of the present invention can include a system for implementing<br>
a logical expression. The system can include a first dynamically configurable logic gate and<br>
at least a second dynamically configurable logic gate. Each of the dynamically configurable<br>
logic gates can operate as one of a plurality of different logic gate types according to at least<br>
one provided reference signal.<br>
[0013] The logical expression implemented by the system can be altered responsive to<br>
modifying at least one of the reference signals provided to at least one of the dynamically<br>
configurable logic gates. Each dynamically configurable logic gate can receive a separate or<br>
individual reference signal, or each can receive a same reference signal. The first and second<br>
dynamically configurable logic gates can be implemented as chaotic logic gates.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] The present invention provides a chaotic logic gate method, system, and apparatus<br>
that can be configured to function as any of a variety of different logic gates such as an "and"<br>
(AND) gate, an "or" (OR) gate, an "exclusive or" (XOR) gate, and a "not" (NOT) gate. The<br>
functionality of the chaotic logic gate can be altered by changing one or more reference<br>
voltages provided to the gate. Accordingly, a chaotic logic gate in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements disclosed herein, for example, can function as one type of gate, such,<br>
as an AND logic gate, and during operation be instructed to begin operating or functioning as<br>
another type of logic gate, such as an OR logic gate.<br>
[0022] Table 1 below illustrates a truth table of basic operations. For example, column 3<br>
illustrates the function of an AND gate given inputs column 4 shows the function of<br>
an OR gate given inputs and column 5 shows the function of an XOR gate given<br>
inputs   The second portion of Table 1 illustrates the operation of a NOT gate given<br>
input <br><br>
[0023] A chaotic logic gate can have an initial state represented by a value of x. In<br>
accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein, each of the basic logic gate<br>
operations: AND, OR, NOT and XOR, involve the following three steps:<br>
1. Inputs.  for the AND, OR, and XOR operations; for the<br>
NOT operation, where x0 represents the initial state of the system,. <br><br><br>
2.	Chaotic update. .where is a chaotic function.<br>
3.	Threshold. To obtain output Z: <br>
where x is the threshold. This is interpreted as logic output 0 if Z = 0 and logic output 1 if<br>
Z=S.<br>
[0024] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the input and output can<br>
have equivalent definitions such that one unit is the same quantity for input and output as<br>
well as for various logical operations. This requires that the constant 5 assumes the same<br>
value throughout a network. Such a configuration allows the output of one chaotic module<br>
functioning as a gate to be coupled to another chaotic module, also functioning as a particular<br>
gate, to form gate arrays for implementing compounded logic operations.<br>
[0025] Given a dynamics f(x) to be used within a physical device, the values of<br>
threshold and initial state signals that satisfy the conditions derived from the truth table to be<br>
implemented must be determined. Table 2 below illustrates the necessary conditions to be<br>
satisfied by a chaotic computing element in order to implement the logical operations AND,<br>
OR, XOR, and NOT. The symmetry of inputs reduces the four conditions in the truth table<br>
illustrated in Table 1 to three distinct conditions, where rows two and three of Table I can be<br>
combined and represented by condition two in Table 2.<br><br>
[0026] Table 3 below shows the exact solutions of the initial x0 and threshold x which<br>
satisfy the conditions in Table 2 when f(x) = 4ax(1-x) with parameter a = 1. The constant<br>
8 = y is common to both input and output and to all logical gates.<br><br>
[0027] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a high level circuit architecture 100 for<br>
a chaotic logic gate in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. As<br><br>
shown, the chaotic logic gate can include a chaotic updater 105, a threshold controller 110, an<br>
adder 115, and a subtracter 120. The threshold controller 110 provides a reference voltage of<br>
x0 as an output. The reference voltage x0 is provided to the adder 115. The adder can sum<br>
the reference voltage signal received from the threshold controller 110 as well as any<br>
received inputs. For example, the adder 115 can receive logic level inputs of I, where<br>
I = I1 + I2. The summed signal is provided as an input to the chaotic updater 105.<br>
[0028] The chaotic updater 105 implements a dynamics function denoted as f(x). For<br>
example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the chaotic updater 105 can<br>
implement the function f(x) = 4ax(1-x), where a = 1. Thus, the chaotic updater 105 can be<br>
implemented as a one dimensional logistic map iteration. Given a dynamics f(x)<br>
corresponding to a physical device, the values of threshold and initial state satisfying the<br>
conditions derived from the truth table to be implemented must be determined. Still, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that other functions also can be used, including, but not<br>
limited to, continuous time chaotic functions.<br>
[0029] The chaotic updater 105 processes the incoming summed signal and generates<br>
xn+y The chaotic updater 105 applies f(x) to the summed signal, the result of which, xn+1,<br>
can be provided to the subtracter 120. The subtracter 120 can determine a difference signal<br>
between the xn+l signal and the x signal. The x signal is another reference signal provided<br>
to the circuit architecture. The resulting difference signal is provided as the logic level output<br>
signal.<br>
[0030] FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary circuit implementation<br>
of the chaotic updater 105 depicted in FIG. 1. In the circuit implementation, xn+1, xn+l, and<br>
xn+1 denote voltages normalized to a source voltage of ±10V. For example, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the voltage sources can be normalized to ±10V. Still,<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable voltage source can be used.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to operating with voltage sources of ±10V.<br>
[0031] An analog multiplier 205 is used as a squarer to produce an output voltage for a<br>
given xn signal received as an input. The multiplier can be implemented, for example, using<br>
an analog multiplier integrated circuit (IC). For instance, an AD633 IC by Analog Devices,<br>
Inc. of Norwood, Massachusetts can be used. The analog multiplier can be used as a squarer<br>
to produce an output voltage of x2n/ V for a given xn as input.<br>
[0032] By using a suitable inverting amplifier, inverting summing amplifier, and a sign-<br>
changer, which can be realized with op-amps 230, 235, and 210, a voltage proportional to<br><br>
Axn(1-xn) or xn+1 is available at the output of op-amp 210. A variable resistor VR1 is<br>
employed to control the parameter a from 0 to 1 in the logistic map. The output voltage of<br>
op-amp 210 becomes a new input voltage to the analog multiplier 205 after passing through<br>
two sample-and-hold circuits 215 and 220 (SHI and SH2), provided terminals A and B are<br>
connected to their respective counterpart terminals of the remainder of the chaotic logic gate<br>
architecture disclosed herein. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
sample-and-hold circuits 215 and 220 can be constructed using LF398 or ADG412 IC's.<br>
[0033] Exemplary resistance values for the embodiment of the chaotic updater 105 shown<br>
in FIG. 2A can be R1 = 10 kilo-ohm, R2 = 25 kilo-ohm, and R3 = 100 kilo-ohm. Both <br>
variable resistors VR1 and VR2 can have values of 10 kilo-ohm. The capacitive values for<br>
the system can be as follows: C1 =0.1 micro-Farad and C2 = 0.01 micro-Farad. Op-amps<br>
230,235, and 210 can be implemented as LM741 or AD712 op-amps.<br>
[0034] FIG. 2B is a timing graph illustrating exemplary timing pulses that can be used to<br>
drive the sample and hold circuits of 215 and 220 of FIG. 2A. The sample and hold circuits<br>
can be triggered by suitable delayed timing pulses T1 and T2 as shown. The timing pulses<br>
typically are generated from a clock generator providing a delay of feedback. According to<br>
one embodiment, a clock rate of. 5kHz or 10 kHz can be used. It should be appreciated,<br>
however, that any of a variety of suitable clock rates can be used to drive the sample and hold<br>
circuits.<br>
[0035] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary circuit implementation of<br>
the threshold controller, adder, and subtracter of the chaotic logic gate implementation of<br>
FIG. 1. That is, when terminals A and B of the circuit implementation illustrated in FIG. 3<br>
are connected with terminals A and B respectively of FIG. 2A, the union of the two circuit<br>
implementations form an embodiment of the chaotic logic gate of FIG. 1. In the present<br>
configuration, the input and output variables have been normalized. In this case, for example,<br>
the input and output variables can be normalized to 10 V.<br>
[0036] A precision clipping circuit can be used as the threshold controller. For example,<br>
as shown, the control circuit 305 can serve as the threshold controller that generates the signal<br>
x0 at terminal C corresponding to the input signal xn+1 at A under the threshold control<br>
voltage V0. The input voltage I can be equal to 0 V, 0.25 V or 0.5 V corresponding to<br>
different logic gates. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, x is another reference<br>
threshold voltage being used to produce the difference voltage and logic gate output signal 8<br><br>
from the xn+I signal. The 5 signal and the input signal /determine the logic condition of the<br>
different gates.<br>
[0037] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the circuit configuration<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 can be implemented using µA741 model op-amps for op-amps 310, 315,<br>
320, 325, 330, and 335. Resistance values can be set as follows: R1 = 100 kilo-ohm and R2<br>
= 1 kilo-ohm. Diode model number IN4148 or IN34A can be used in place of diode 340.<br>
[0038] FIG. 4A is a series of timing graphs illustrating timing sequences of<br>
implementations of a representative OR gate configuration formed in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements disclosed herein. The timing sequences of the exemplary OR gate<br>
implementation, from top to bottom, represent: (1) first input I1,; (2) second input I2; (3)<br>
state after chaotic update f(x); and (4) output obtained by thresholding.<br>
[0039] FIG. 4B is a series of timing graphs illustrating timing sequences of<br>
implementations of a representative NOT gate configuration formed in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements disclosed herein. The timing sequences of the exemplary NOT gate<br>
implementation, from top to bottom, represent: (1) input I; (2) state after chaotic update<br>
f(x); and (3) output obtained by thresholding.<br>
[0040] Another aspect of the present invention can include a system for implementing a<br>
logical function such as a Boolean expression. The system can include one or more<br>
dynamically configurable logic gates, for example chaotic logic gates in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements disclosed herein. One or more of the dynamically configurable logic<br>
gates can operate as one of a plurality of different logic gate types according to at least one<br>
provided reference signal. Notably, each dynamically configurable logic gate can receive a<br>
separate or individual reference signal, or each can receive a same reference signal. In the<br>
event that more than two dynamically configurable logic gates are included, one or more of<br>
the logic gates can receive a same reference signal and/or an individual reference signal.<br>
[0041] Accordingly, one logic gate, a set of logic gates, or all of the logic gates within the<br>
system can change functionality according to a provided reference signal. For example, a set<br>
of logic gates can be altered to stop functioning as AND logic gates and begin functioning as<br>
OR logic gates while in operation. In another example, each logic gate can be controlled<br>
using a separate reference signal that controls only one gate. In that case, for instance, a first<br>
set of logic gates functioning as AND logic gates can be instructed to begin operating as OR<br>
logic gates, while a second set of logic gates, also functioning as AND logic gates, can be<br>
instructed to begin functioning as XOR logic gates. Regardless, the entire functionality of the<br><br>
system can be altered. Thus, a system designed to implement one type of Boolean expression<br>
can be modified using control signals to dynamically begin implementing a different Boolean<br>
expression.<br>
[0042] The inventive arrangements disclosed herein have been illustrated using different<br>
examples that have incorporated specific discrete components. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that such components have been provided for purposes of illustration only.<br>
Accordingly, any of a variety of different components, whether functional equivalents,<br>
variants, or alternatives of the discrete components or of the higher level components (i.e. of<br>
FIG. 1) disclosed herein, can be used. As such, the invention is not limited to the use of a<br>
particular component or set of components. Further, it should be appreciated that the present<br>
invention can be implemented as one or more discrete components or as a single larger<br>
component. The present invention also can be implemented within silicon as an integrated<br>
circuit.<br>
[0043] As this invention can be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit<br>
or essential attributes thereof. Accordingly, reference should be made to the following<br>
