				<td>Composite pane with a film laminate<br>
The invention relates to a composite pane having a film<br>
laminate with the features of the precharacterizing<br>
clause of Patent Claim 1.<br>
Composite panes which are intended for installation in<br>
vehicle sliding and lifting roofs or else as rear side<br>
windows and windscreens for vehicles are known, which<br>
are composed essentially of two rigid panes of glass or<br>
plastic, and of adhesive films which adhesively connect<br>
these two rigid panes to one another. An adhesive film<br>
whose bulk is coloured is often used in order to absorb<br>
a portion of the light which passes through the<br>
composite pane when in the installed state. The<br>
acoustic behaviour (silencing) as well as the UV<br>
resistance of the final assembly are improved by<br>
combination with an uncoloured adhesive film which is<br>
clearly transparent in its own right in the final<br>
stages. For the latter purpose, the untoned adhesive<br>
film faces the incident light or solar radiation<br>
(located on the outside) when the composite pane is in<br>
the installed state. It absorbs the majority of the<br>
incident UV radiation, which could change the colour of<br>
the coloured adhesive film in the long term.<br>
The two adhesive films are fused on virtually<br>
completely during the final connection of the layers<br>
for this composite pane; in an autoclave process at<br>
about 130 to 150°C. The finished composite pane<br>
exhibits a clearly perceptible inhomogeneous cloudy<br>
colouring when it is looked through, however, so-called<br>
"orange skin" . It has been found that the rough and<br>
wavy surfaces of the films on the boundary surface<br>
between the clear and the coloured adhesive film leads<br>
to non-uniform flow phenomena in the autoclave, and to<br>
thickness fluctuations, resulting from this, in the<br>
films, whose thickness was approximately uniform before<br>
being fused, to be precise, irrespective of whether the<br>
two films which had been laminated on to one another<br>
were originally of the same thickness, or of different<br>
thicknesses.<br>
The roughness and corrugation of the film surfaces are<br>
on the one hand unavoidable during production, but on<br>
the other hand, they contribute to reliable venting of<br>
the initial assembly when a reduced pressure is<br>
applied. Air which is enclosed between the layers has<br>
to be removed, as is known, and in the process flows<br>
away through the channels formed by the surface<br>
structures.<br>
Composite panes are also known in which a further<br>
thermoplastic film, generally composed of PET<br>
(polyethyleneteraphthalate) is laminated in between two<br>
adhesive films in order to increase the thermal<br>
insulation, and is itself provided with a coating<br>
(which contains metal) which reflects infrared waves. A<br>
film composed of a PET-PMMA co-extrudate or co-laminate<br>
can also be used without any metal components for the<br>
same function (known by the product name 3M® SRF "solar<br>
reflecting film").<br>
The problem of different colouring and mixing of the<br>
adhesive films does not, of course, occur with these<br>
film laminates - with adhesive films of the same<br>
colour.<br>
The invention is based on the object, of improving a<br>
composite pane of this generic type with a film<br>
laminate composed of differently coloured adhesive<br>
films such that optical disturbances caused by<br>
thickness fluctuations during the fusion process are<br>
avoided.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
the features of Patent Claim 1. The features of the<br>
dependent claims indicate advantageous developments of<br>
this subject matter.<br>
The undesirable optical effect can be reliably avoided<br>
by inserting at least one further intermediate layer<br>
between the coloured adhesive film and the clear<br>
adhesive film, which further intermediate layer does<br>
not change its surface in the autoclave process, and<br>
which essentially retains its physical shape, which is<br>
produced at the latest after the composite layers have<br>
been placed together. The surfaces of the adjacent<br>
adhesive films are thus uniformly flattened during the<br>
fusion process, and cannot form optically perceptible<br>
ripples.<br>
By way of example, the intermediate layer may be a<br>
clear PET film, a coated PET film, for example of the<br>
Southwall XIR type, a PET-PMMA co-extrudate, for<br>
example of the 3M® SRF type, or else numerous other<br>
films (for example, composed of PC, PE, PEN, PMMA,<br>
PVC), which are optically as highly transparent as<br>
possible and whose surface and consistency do not<br>
change in the autoclave.<br>
A further major requirement is, of course, that the<br>
films which are used as the intermediate layer are<br>
compatible with the adjacent adhesive films. In<br>
particular, there must be good adhesion between the<br>
adhesive films and the intermediate layer in order to<br>
avoid any risk of de-lamination. Furthermore, there<br>
must be no chemical or physical interactions which<br>
could lead to optical or mechanical disturbances during<br>
the life of the composite pane.<br>
A further rigid pane could also be inserted as the<br>
intermediate layer, preferably but not exclusively an<br>
extremely thin glass or plastic pane (for example<br>
composed of polycarbonate) which, if required, can even<br>
be matched to a slight bending of the two rigid panes<br>
of the composite pane without preforming. If the<br>
composite pane is flat and/or its total thickness and<br>
its weight are less important, then the intermediate<br>
layer may also be formed by a rigid glass or plastic<br>
pane of normal thickness (a few millimetres).<br>
This intermediate layer embedded in the film laminate<br>
in any case results in a defined separating layer or<br>
wall, which prevents any undesirable non-uniform<br>
flowing process between the two different adhesive<br>
films even when these are fused on completely. The<br>
composite panes produced in this way are optically very<br>
homogeneously coloured when looked through.<br>
In a further variant of the invention, additional<br>
toning of the finished product when looked through can<br>
also be achieved by suitable colouring of the<br>
intermediate layer itself. A coloured intermediate<br>
layer in addition to the tone of one adhesive film can<br>
result in different colour tones, for example, for<br>
complementary matching to surrounding colours (bodywork<br>
paint, internal equipment in the vehicle) with high<br>
flexibility and reproducibility, even in large-scale<br>
production, for composite panes intrinsically with the<br>
same configuration, in which case, of course, the basic<br>
toning of the coloured adhesive film and the additive<br>
toning of the intermediate layer must be carefully<br>
matched to one another.<br>
Exemplary embodiment:<br>
In order to implement the invention, two rigid panes<br>
are changed to the desired form in the normal manner<br>
(outline and possibly bending contour). The coloured<br>
adhesive film and the uncoloured adhesive film are pre-<br>
cut appropriately and a thin PET film is inserted<br>
between them. The film stack is now placed on one of<br>
the rigid panes, and is covered by the second rigid<br>
pane. The surfaces of the films are generally cut to be<br>
somewhat smaller than the surfaces of the rigid panes.<br>
The latter may both be composed of plastic or glass, or<br>
a glass pane and a plastic pane may be used.<br>
Once the pane and film stack has been vented with the<br>
aid of suitable apparatuses, the initial assembly is<br>
subjected to heat and pressure treatment in an<br>
autoclave process. During this process, the adhesive<br>
films are fused on completely and are closely and<br>
adhesively connected to the respective adjacent<br>
surfaces of the rigid pane and of the intermediate<br>
layer.<br>
The circumferential edge gap between the two rigid<br>
panes in the plane of the film laminate is sealed by<br>
suitable means in a manner known per se, in order to<br>
prevent de-lamination starting from this point.<br>
Alternately, instead of being placed together before<br>
being connected, the film laminate can also be taken<br>
from an initial production phase, after which either<br>
one of the adhesive films is pre-laminated with the<br>
intermediate layer, so that the second adhesive film<br>
just has to be placed on it, or all three film layers<br>
are brought together at this stage and just have to be<br>
cut to match the rigid panes.<br>
Pre-laminates such as these are used in particular when<br>
the intermediate layer is in the form of a coated PET<br>
film, with the coated main surface being covered with<br>
an adhesive film shortly after the coating process, in<br>
order to prevent damage to the sensitive multiple layer<br>
or layer system.<br>
