				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Colony stimulating factor(CSF), as a glycoprotein acting on production, division, and<br>
activity of hematopoietic cell, is classified into granulocyte colony stimulating factor(G-CSF),<br>
macrophage colony stimulating tactor(M-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating<br>
factor(GM-CSF), multi colony stimulating factor(multi-CSF), etc.<br>
It is known that G-CSF increases releasing of matured neutrophils into peripheral<br>
blood by facilitating production and division of neutrophilic precursor at bone marrow;<br>
induces a phagocytic activity by activating matured neutrophils; represents an antibody<br>
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity; generates superoxides; and increases reactivity against<br>
chemotactic factor.<br>
Human granulocyte colony stimulating factor(hG-CSF) was firstly separated from<br>
bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 by Welt et al. in 1985, and recombinant hG-CSF(rhG-CSF)<br>
was produced by cloning of gene from cDNA library of a cancer cell by Nagata et al., Souza<br>
et al. in 1986. rhG-CSF currently used in clinical trials is filgrastim binding methionine at N-<br>
terminal of protein without glycosylation, produced in Escherichia coli, and lenograstim with<br>
glycosylation, produced in animal cell.<br>
In case of using rhG-CSF clinically, rhG-CSF has to be administrated once or more a day for<br>
decreasing leukocyte because rhG-CSF has a short duration of pharmacological effect.<br>
Thus, many studies have been conducted to increase a half-life of circulation of rhG-CSF<br>
using water-soluble polymer, thereby developing the drug to have a long duration of activity<br>
and high stability, and decreasing the frequency of administration.<br>
And, polyethylene glycol in the water-soluble polymer is strongly hydrophilic, and can<br>
increase solubility at the time of bonding with protein for treatment. Also, polyethylene<br>
glycol is effective for increasing the molecular amount of protein bonded thereto, with<br><br>
maintaining main biological functions such as enzyme activity and receptor binding. Thus,<br>
polyethylene glycol can decrease the filtration of kidney, and effectively protect protein from<br>
proteolytic enzyme to decompose the protein. Therefore, many studies have been conducted<br>
to find out modifying methods of protein by using polyethylene glycol because it has the<br>
advantages to prevent protein decomposition, increase the stability and circulation time of<br>
protein, and decrease immunogenicity.<br>
Korean Patent No. 0508358 disclosed conjugates and a preparing method thereof, wherein<br>
the conjugates have biological activities and are in the form of binding a biocompatibility<br>
polymer to thiol of cysteine residue of G-CSF, in the molar ratio of the polymer: G-CSF to<br>
stoichiometrically 0.7~1.3:1, preferably 1:1. But, since the cysteine residue of G-CSF which<br>
does not form disulfide bonds in G-CSF is main bonding part with G-CSF receptor, the<br>
conjugate using the cysteine residue has a drawback that its actual proliferation effect for<br>
neutrophil is little. And, because the conjugates immediately aggregate to bind a PEG to<br>
cysteine residues of G-CSF, it has a disadvantage that a small amount of SDS should be<br>
added to the conjugate to prevent the aggregation for safekeeping and the SDS was removed<br>
by ultrafiltration for administrating in vivo.<br>
Korean Patent No. 0507796 disclosed PEG-homodimer conjugates binding a biological<br>
active polypeptide and a PEG, to increase the half-life in vivo of polypeptide. Particularly, it<br>
described that the homodimer binds an amino group of lycine residues of bioactive<br>
polypeptide of two molecules to a PEG to increase the residual time and sustain biological<br>
activities for a long time. But, the conjugates have less activity than mono-PEG conjugates<br>
because of conjugation of excessive PEGs and physicochemical and biological characteristics<br>
of the conjugates are not uniform because of non-specific conjugation.<br>
And, the method of binding rhG-CSF to linear SCM-MPEG(Succinimidyl carboxymethyl<br>
ester of methoxy PEG) is known. The mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugates prepared by the<br>
method have 3 types of position isomers modified at N-terminal, lycine 35, and lycine 45<br>
residues. Particularly, the conjugate modified at lycine 35 has a disadvantage leaving PEGs<br>
from the conjugate (Korean Patent No. 0248111, United State Patent No. 5,824,784).<br><br>
United State Patent No. 5,951,974 disclosed conjugates of binding a linear SC-<br>
PEG(polyethylene glycol-N-succinimide carbonate) to gene recombination alpha interferon.<br>
The conjugates consist of covalent conjugates of urethane bond at e-amino group of lycine<br>
residues of interferon, a-amino group of N-terminal cystaine residues, and an amino group of<br>
histidine residues. But, the conjugates have a disadvantage leaving PEGs from the conjugate<br>
because the urethane bond of conjugates are unstable.<br>
Commonly used linear polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight of about 1,000~ 25,000<br>
daltons, but has a limitation in binding many linear high molecules to protein or peptide, with<br>
maintaining their activities, due to limited biological active regions of protein and peptide.<br>
Korean Patent No. 0254097 disclosed conjugates binding a two-branched PEG of a lycine<br>
skeletal structure to gene recombination alpha interferon. The conjugates have a merit to<br>
prevent PEG from binding to multi parts of interferon, and have 2 times the molecular weight<br>
of PEG by that of the linear PEG because two linear PEGs bind to a single part of interferon.<br>
But, the two-branched PEG can be hydrolyzed to a single chain for safekeeping or for<br>
reacting under an alkali condition because the two-branched PEG having a lycine skeletal<br>
structure has two urethane bonds in the PEG.<br>
Generally, it is known that biological activity, durability, etc. of conjugates of binding a PEG<br>
to gene recombination protein is dependent on size and part modified in the PEG. But, it has<br>
not been known yet whether a size of PEG in conjugates binding PEG and rhG-CSF affects<br>
biological activities of a protein. Therefore, there has been a need in the art to overcome the<br>
disadvantages of the known method through controlling a size of PEG and binding to various<br>
skeletal structures of PEG not to decrease bioactivities of G-CSF and to increase the stability<br>
of binding parts.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide three-branched polyethylene<br>
glycol(PEG)-G-CSF conjugates prepared by conjugating three-branched PEG and G-CSF,<br>
having high stability and same or more bioactivities of G-CSF than G-CSF and PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates known in the art; a preparation method of the same; and a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing the same.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides three-branched<br>
polyethylene glycol(PEG)-G-CSF conjugates conjugated between three-branched PEG<br>
derivatives and G-CSF.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of preparing three-branched PEG-G-<br>
CSF conjugates comprising conjugating three-branched PEG derivatives and G-CSF.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
conjugates.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating neutropenia, preventing<br>
neutropenia, or facilitating increase of the number of neutrophil at the time of hematopoietic<br>
stem cell mobilization to peripheral blood and hematopoietic stem cell transplatation,<br>
comprising administrating the conjugate of the present invention as an effective ingredient.<br>
The present invention is explained in detail below.<br>
Three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of the present invention may be prepared by<br>
conjugating three-branched polyethylene glycoI(PEG), represented by the following general<br>
formula(l):<br><br><br>
wherein,<br>
n is an integer of 1 to 1,000;<br>
m is an integer of 10 to 1,000;<br>
Z is (CH2)s or (CH2)sNHCO(CH2)s as a linker of G-CSF and PEG wherein S is an<br>
integer of 1 to 6;<br>
Y is an amide bond formed by combining NH2 functional group in G-CSF and a<br>
functional group of PEG derivative.<br>
The PEG has an average molecular weight of from 200 to 45,000 daltons, preferably<br>
from 20,000 to 45,000 daltons, more preferably from 23,000 to 43,000 daltons. Because a<br>
medicinally effective time can be changed according to an average molecular weight of PEG,<br>
the average molecular weight of PEG used in the present invention can be changed,<br>
depending on the time required for treatment.<br>
The method of preparing three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate comprising<br>
conjugating three-branched PEG derivatives and G-CSF of the present invention is explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
The three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of general formula (1) are prepared by<br>
forming a covalent bond between three-branched PEG derivative of the following general<br>
formula (2) and G-CSF wherein PEG has an average molecular weight of from 200 to 45,000<br>
daltons, preferably from 20,000 to 45,000 daltons, more preferably from23,000 to 43,000<br>
daltons:<br><br><br>
wherein,<br>
n is an integer of 1 to 1,000;<br>
m is an integer of 10 to 1,000;<br>
Z is (CH2)s or (CH2)sNHCO(CH2)s as a linker of G-CSF and PEG wherein S is an<br>
integer of 1 to 6; and<br>
the functional group which can chemically react with proteins and peptides containing<br>
G-CSF is N-hydrosuccinimide.<br>
Three-branched PEG derivatives of the present invention activate high molecules<br>
having branched structure in which three linear biological receptive high molecules are<br>
combined. All of three OH (hydroxy) regions in the glycerol skeletal structure are<br>
polymerized with ethylene glycol unit molecules, and the end of one region is activated as a<br>
functional group. The other two regions except for the activated region are substituted with<br>
monomethoxy, to prevent additional reactions. When the above branched PEG derivatives<br>
are prepared, the size of each linear PEG can be controlled freely by a method known in the<br>
art.<br>
Three-branched PEG derivatives in the present invention can be used as PEG<br>
derivatives, with the functional group chemically reacting with protein and peptide, known in<br>
the art. PEG derivatives of general formula (2) (with N-hydroxysuccinaimde) are preferable<br>
in terms of yield of the conjugate of the present invention.<br>
The G-CSF in the present invention can be separated from mammalian organism or<br>
synthesized by a method known in the art such as gDNA cloning, cDNA cloning, etc. And,<br><br>
the G-CSF can be commercialized in the market.<br>
And, the covalent bond between G-CSF and the three-branched PEG derivatives can<br>
be formed at a low temperature. The reaction is completed by adding acids, and the prepared<br>
three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates can be purified by a method known in the art such as<br>
the purification method using a cation exchange resin.<br>
In the present invention, the reaction molar ratio of the G-CSF to the three-branched<br>
PEG derivative is from 1: 0.5 to 1: 50. A preferable molar ratio of the G-CSF to the three-<br>
branched PEG derivative is from 1: 0.5 to 1: 5 because the yield of mono PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate is decreased, as the molar ratio of polyethylene glycol to the G-CSF is increased.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating or<br>
preventing symptoms caused by decreased hematopoietic function or decreased immunologic<br>
function. Particularly, clinical trials using the conjugate of the present invention as an<br>
effective showed that the number of neuctrophil was decreased, and the symptoms were<br>
relieved or controlled, for diseases caused in a treatment such as cancer chemotherapy or<br>
radiation therapy; infective diseases caused by bacteria, virus and fungus; other infective<br>
diseases; diseases caused by genetic or environmental reason such as severe chronic<br>
neutropenia and leukemia; or geriatric diseases caused by again. For example, symptoms<br>
caused by decreased hematopoietic function or decreased immunologic function are<br>
neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapy for blood tumor or solid cancer, neutropenia<br>
caused by myelodysplastic syndrome, neutropenia caused by aplastic anemia, congenital<br>
idiopathic neutropenia, and neutropenia caused from treating human immunodeficiency virus.<br>
The composition can be composed of PEG-G-CSF conjugates of the present invention<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, antiseptics, solubilizer, emulsifier, adjuvant, and/or<br>
carrier.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be formulated to injection agent, capsule,<br>
tablet, liquid drug, pill, ointment, oculentum, coUyrium, transdermal absorptive agent, paste,<br>
cataplasm, aerosols, etc.<br><br>
And, the effective dosage of G-CSF is very small such as 0.1 -500 μg (preferably,<br>
5-50 μg). And, the drug comprising 0.1 -500 μg of G-CSF may be administrated to an<br>
adult, generally from 1 to 7 times a week. Thus, the effective dosage of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention can be calculated by a known administration amount of<br>
G-CSF and a molecular weight of PEG used in the present invention. The effective dosage of<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be varied, but generally once a<br>
week, and the composition can be administrated once or many times a day within a daily<br>
effective dosage range.<br>
The following examples are intended to further illustrate the present invention, and the<br>
scope of the present invention is not intended to be limited thereby in any way.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
The three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of the present invention are more<br>
pharmaceutically stable than linear- or two-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates in the aspect of<br>
leaving PEGs from PEG-G-CSF conjugates and forming the aggregates of conjugates. And,<br>
the conjugates of the present invention can be used without additional separations of position<br>
isomers because the conjugates consist of position isomers with similar activities. And, the<br>
composition of the present invention has the effects of continuous production of neutrophilias<br>
and increased in-vivo half-life.<br>

MODE FOR INVENTION<br><example> Preparation of three-branched polyethylene glycol (PEG MW 23,000<br>
Da)-G-CSF conjugates<br>
10 mg of rhG-CSF (Dong-A Pharm. Co., Ltd.) was filtrated with pH8.5 and 50 mM of<br>
sodium borate buffer solution. Then 9.2mg of three-branched PEG having N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimde (NOF corporation, Japan) and the molecular weight of 23,000 daltons<br>
was added to the solution in the molar ratio of rhG-CSF : three-branched PEG to 1: 0.75. And,<br>
the solution was stirred at 4 °C for 90min. The reaction was stopped by adding lOOmM of<br>
HCL to make the solution pH 4 and by diluting with sterile distilled water of 5 times the<br>
volume of the solution. Then, the mixture was inputted in SP-Sepharose Fast Flow cation<br>
exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equalized with 20mM of sodium<br>
acetate (pH4.0) buffer solution, and three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate was separated.<br>
The mixture was fractioned by using 0 ~ IM of concentration gradient of sodium<br>
chloride(NaCl). The molar ratio of three-branched PEG to G-CSF in the three-branched PEG-<br>
G-CSF conjugates was confirmed by HPLC and SDS-PAGE. And, di- or more (tri-, tetra-<br>
...) three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates, unreacted G-CSF remaining after the reaction,<br>
etc. were excluded. And, the eluates were concentrated and sterilized-filtered to obtain the<br>
mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate in which a G-CSF and a three-branched PEG<br>
(MW 23,000Da) are conjugated (or called as mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate).<br>
It was confirmed that the reaction mixture consisted of 35.4% of mono-three-branched<br>
PEG-G-CSF conjugate(mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugate), about 59.4% of G-CSF unmodified by<br>
PEG, and the others [di-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate(di-PEG-G-CSF conjugate),<br>
and N-hydroxysuccinimide(NHS)], by a size-exclusion high performance chromatography<br>
(see Fig. 1, wherein 1 and 2 represent di-PEG-G-CSF conjugate, 3 represents mono-PEG-G-<br>
CSF conjugate, 4 represents G-CSF unmodified by PEG, and 5 represents NHS leaving from<br>
three-branched PEG). And, the purity of mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF separated from<br><br>
the mixture was measured by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (see<br>
Fig. 4, wherein 2 represents di-PEG-G-CSF conjugate, and 3 represents mono-PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate) and the molecular weight was measured by matrix assisted laser<br>
desorption/ionization time-of-flight(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (see, Fig. 7: the<br>
analytic result of mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF by MALDI-TOF/MS). And, the position<br>
isomers were separated by cation exchange resin analytic column (SP-5WP, TOSOH) to<br>
confirm that the ratio for each position isomer is about 54%: 33%: 10% (see. Fig. 10). And, It<br>
was confirmed that each position isomer has very similar activity, in the experiment for<br>
biological activity of each position isomer (see. Fig. 11)<br><exainpie> Preparation of three-branched polyethylene glycol (PEG MW 43,000<br>
Da)-G-CSF conjugates<br>
10 mg of rhG-CSF (Dong-A Pharm. Co., Ltd.) was filtrated with pH8.5 and 50 mM of<br>
sodium borate buffer solution. Then, 17.2mg of three-branched PEG with M-<br>
hydroxysuccinimde (NOF corporation, Japan) and the molecular weight of 43,000 daltons<br>
was added to the solution to make the molar ratio of the rhG-CSF : the three-branced PEG to<br>
1: 0.75. And, the solution was stirred at 4 °C for 90min. And, the reaction was stopped by<br>
adding 100mM of HCl to make the solution pH 4 and by diluting with sterile distilled water<br>
of 5 times the solution volume. And, the mixture was inputted in SP-Sepharose Fast Flow<br>
cation exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equalized with 20mM of<br>
sodium acetate(pH4.0) buffer solution, and three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate was<br>
separated therefrom. The mixture was fractioned by using 0 ~ IM of concentration gradient<br>
of sodium chloride(NaCl). The molar ratio of three-branched PEG to G-CSF in the three-<br>
branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates was confirmed by HPLC and SDS-PAGE. And di- or<br>
more (tri, tetra...)-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates, unreacted G-CSF remaining after<br>
the reaction, etc. were excluded. And, the eluates were concentrated and sterilized-filtered to<br>
obtain the mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate in which a G-CSF and a three-<br>
branched PEG (MW 43,000Da) are conjugated(or called as mono-three-branched PEG-G-<br>
CSF conjugate).<br>
It was confirmed that the mixture of the reaction consisted of 18.7% of mono-three-<br>
branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate (mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugate), about 40.1% of G-CSF<br><br>
unmodified by PEG, and the others [di-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate(di-PEG-G-<br>
CSF conjugate), and N-hydroxysuccinimide(NHS)] by size-exclusionhigh performance<br>
chromatography (see Fig. 2, wherein 2 represents di-PEG-G-CSF conjugate, 3 represents<br>

The property and pharmacological activity tests were conducted by using the<br>
conjugates prepared above, and the results are as follows.<br><experimental example> Analytic separation of position isomers of three-branched<br>
PEG-G-CSF conjugates<br>
100 μg of Mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Example 1 was input to a<br>
cation exchange resin analytic column(SP-5WP, TOSOH) equalized with 25mM of sodium<br>
acetate buffer(pH 4.0, controlled with glacial acetic acid), and each position isomer of the<br>
conjugates was separated by 100mM of sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.8). It was confirmed that<br>
the ratio of each position isomer is about 54%: 33%: 10% (see. Fig. 10).<br><experimental example> Analysis of biological activities of position isomers of<br>
three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates<br>
Relative Biological activities of position isomers of three-branched PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates of Example 1 were measured by using that of G-CSF.<br>
NFS-60 cell strain cultured at growth RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 1ng/ml of<br>
rmIL-3 was washed 3 times with test RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. And, the cell strain<br>
was divided into 100ml(2xl05 cells/ml) at 96 well plate. Then the sample was diluted with<br>
test medium to prepare a sample of 200ng/ml, and 9 more samples of 200ng/ml by 5 times<br>
gradient, and the samples were divided into 3 wells, each 100ml, per concentration in 96well<br>
plates containing the cell solutions.<br>
Each well was cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 incubator for 48hs, 40 μl of MTS was<br>
added to each well. After 2hs, an absorbance of the sample was measured at 490nm by an<br>
ELISA reader. EC50 was calculated by a dose response curve and a linear regression analysis<br>
of point comprised straight line of a standard curve, and the activities of position isomers<br><br>
were determined (see, Fig.l 1). The three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of the present<br>
invention have position isomers having similar activities. That is, it is not necessary to<br>
remove some position isomers having relatively lower activity because the three-branched<br>
PEG-G-CSF conjugates of the present invention are composed of conjugates with uniformed<br>
activities<br><experimental example> Pharmacokinetics test of the three-branched PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates<br>
The pharmacodynamic test was conducted to inject hypodermically each of G-CSF, the<br>
PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Example 1, and the PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Example 2, into<br>
test rats (Sprague Dawley) which had 240 ~ 260g of body weights. After injecting them in<br>
the amount of 400μg per rat, the blood samples were collected from the rats at 0 min, 30min,<br>
1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr, 8hr, 12hr, 1day, 2days, 3days, 4days, 5days, 6days, and 7days, after the<br>
injection. And, the concentrations of the G-CSF conjugates in the sample were<br>
quantitatively analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit(Biosource,<br>
USA).<br>
The half-life in blood of the PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Example 1 and Example 2 was<br>
increased 3 times and 10.8, respectively, compared with that of G-CSF, and the areas under<br>
the concentration time curve in blood of the conjugates of Example 1 and Example 2 were<br>
also increased by 7.6 times and 23.4 times, respectively, compared with that of G-CSF [Table<br>
1 : Pharmacokinetics test of the three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates and G-CSF at<br>
rat(Sprague Dawley rat)]. It was confirmed by this test that pharmacokinetics of PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate is dependent on a size of PEG.<br><br><br><br><experimental example> Stability test of the three-branched PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates on leaving PEGs from the conjugates<br>
PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Examples 1 and 2, and Comparative Examples 2, 3, and 4<br>
were deposited under pH 7 and 37 °C for 7days, and the aspects of leaving PEGs in length of<br>
time were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, to estimate<br>
the degrees of leaving PEGs on a skeletal structure, molecular weights, and branched types of<br>
PEG.<br>
In the PEG'S skeletal structure, the leaving PEGs occurred most frequently in<br>
Comparative Example 2 using linear PEG. However, the leavings PEGs from the conjugates<br>
of Examples 1 and 2, and Comparative Example 4 occurred less frequently than those of<br>
Comparative Examples 2 and 3 (Table 2: Comparison of generation rates of G-CSF in PEG-<br>
G-CSF conjugates having various PEG skeletal structures). This test confirmed that the three-<br>
branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate is more stable than the linear-, two-branched PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates, and the conjugate with a glycerol skeletal structure is more stable than the<br>
conjugates with a iycine skeletal structure.<br><br><br>
conjugates against forming aggregations according to a skeletal structure of PEG and a type<br>
ofbinding PEG to G-CSF<br>
Mono three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate of Example 1; mono PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate of Comparative Examples 2 and 4, having a similar molecular weight to the<br>
conjugate of Example 1 and different skeletal structure from the conjugate of Example 1; and<br>
mono PEG-G-CSF conjugate of Comparative Example 5 having different binding type from<br>
the conjugate of Example 1 were tested to measure stabilities against forming aggregations.<br>
Each sample was collected by 500μl, and the solvent of the samples were exchanged 3 times<br>
with 100mM of phosphate buffer solution having pH7. And, the samples were deposited at<br>
37°C for 14 days, and formation of aggregation of the conjugates was analyzed by size-<br>
exclusion high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The analysis results of forming of the aggregation represent that mono-PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate of Example 1 had most stability in the aspect of leaving PEGs, and formed the least<br>
aggregation (Table 3: Generation rates of aggregation conjugates according to a skeletal<br>
structure of PEG and a type of binding PEG to G-CSF). Mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugates of<br>
Comparative Examples 2 and 4 using PEG having the same glycerol skeletal structure as<br>
PEGs in Example 1, and using the same binding type to Example 1, as well as the conjugate<br>
of Example 1, formed some aggregation. However, mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugates of<br>
Comparative Example 3 using PEG having different skeletal structure from PEGs in Example<br>
1 (although using the same binding type as Example 1) formed much aggregation. And,<br>
mono-PEG-G-CSF conjugates of Comparative Example 5 using PEG having different<br>
skeletal structure from PEGs in Example 1 and using the different binding type from<br>
Example 1 formed 2 times or more of aggregation, compared with the conjugates of Example 1.<br><br><br>
In conclusion, mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugate of Example 1 is most<br>
stable in both leaving PEGs from the conjugates and forming aggregation. That is, this<br>
advantageous effect is from different skeletal structures between branched PEG and branched<br>
PEG used in the present invention.<br><experimentai example> Neutrophil proliferation activities assay of PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugates at animal model to which an anti-cancer medicine is administrated.<br>
Neutrophil proliferation activities of mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF conjugates of<br>
Example 1, mono-mPEG(methoxy polyethylene glycol)-G-CSF conjugates of Comparative<br>
Examples 5 and 6 having different binding type and different molecular weight from the<br>
conjugates of Example 2 were assayed by mouse model to which an anti-cancer agent was<br>
administrated.<br>
Mice(BDFl) of 20 ~ 25g were administrated with 200 mg/kg of an anti-cancer<br>
agent(cyclophosphamide) to decrease the number of neutrophil for 2days.<br>
And, each of the conjugate of Example I and the conjugates of Comparative Examples<br>
5 and 6 was administrated subcutaneously once, 1mg/kg per mouse, and G-CSF was<br>
administrated 8 times by 0.125 mg/kg per mouse to make the total administration amount 1<br>
mg/kg. The mice' bloods were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 days, and the<br>
total numbers of leukocyte and neutrophil were measured by automatic hemocyte measuring<br>
instrument (HEMAVET 850, Drew Scientific Ltd., UK). The periods that started the<br>
recovery of neutrophils decreased by an anti-cancer agent and the times required for the<br>
recovery of neutrophil, in the conjugate of Example 1 and the conjugates of Comparative<br>
Examples 5 and 6 were similar. However, the time reaching the maximum number of<br>
neutrophil in the conjugate of Example 1 was about 12hs faster than those of the conjugates<br>
of Comparative Examples 5 and 6. The area under the increased neutrophil count-time<br>
curve(AU-NC) of the conjugate of Example 1 was largest (Table 4: Neutrophil proliferation<br>
activities assay of PEG-G-CSF conjugates at animal model to which an anti-cancer medicine<br>
is administrated). Therefore, it was confirmed that mono-three-branched PEG-G-CSF<br>
conjugate has a rapid effect of Neutrophil proliferation.<br>
