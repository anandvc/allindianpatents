CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]   This  application  claims  the  benefit  of  U.S.  Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/027,250, filed on February 8, 2008.  The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]   The present disclosure relates to systems and method for<br>
monitoring urea levels.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] To meet nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission requirements for a<br>
vehicle with a diesel engine, urea may be injected into an exhaust stream. The<br>
urea is stored in a tank that may be similar to a conventional fuel tank. Since the<br>
emissions impact of running out of urea is severe, correct urea level indication is<br>
required to inform the driver. For example, the vehicle may be required to<br>
operate in a limp home mode when the urea runs out.<br><br>
[0005] Several unique characteristics of urea delivery systems make<br>
urea level sensing systems and on board diagnostic (OBD) monitoring different<br>
than fuel level monitoring systems. For example, urea freezes at low<br>
temperatures. In addition, the volume of urea consumed per mile may be as low<br>
as 5 gallons for 4000 miles. Level sensing systems may be required to<br>
independently verify range readings from the sensor.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A sensor diagnostic system comprises first, second, and third<br>
dosing agent sensors and a control module. The first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors indicate whether a dosing agent is present at first, second, and<br>
third volumetric levels of a dosing agent tank, respectively. The second<br>
volumetric level is greater than the first volumetric level and the third volumetric<br>
level is greater than the second volumetric level. The control module selectively<br>
diagnoses a sensor fault in at least one of the first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors based on the indications of the first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors.<br>
[0007] In other features, the control module diagnoses the sensor fault<br>
when the third dosing agent sensor indicates that the dosing agent is present and<br>
at least one of the first and second dosing agent sensors indicates that the<br>
dosing agent is absent.<br>
[0008] In still other features, the control module diagnoses the sensor<br>
fault when the second dosing agent sensor indicates that the dosing agent is<br><br>
present and the first dosing agent sensor indicates that the dosing agent is<br>
absent.<br>
[0009] In further features, the control module diagnoses the sensor<br>
fault when the first dosing agent sensor transitions to indicating that the dosing<br>
agent is absent while the second dosing agent sensor indicates that the dosing<br>
agent is present.<br>
[0010] In still further features, the control module diagnoses the sensor<br>
fault when the second dosing agent sensor transitions to indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is absent while the third dosing agent sensor indicates that the<br>
dosing agent is present.<br>
[0011] In other features, the control module diagnoses the sensor fault<br>
when the first dosing agent sensor transitions to indicating that the dosing agent<br>
is absent while a pump pressure is greater than a predetermined pressure.<br>
[0012] In still other features, the control module diagnoses the sensor<br>
fault when a quantity of the dosing agent injected into an exhaust stream<br>
between a first time and a second time is less than a predetermined quantity.<br>
The first time corresponds to when the third dosing agent sensor transitions to<br>
indicating that the dosing agent is absent while the second dosing agent sensor<br>
indicates that the dosing agent is present. The second time is after the first time<br>
when the second dosing agent sensor transitions to indicating that the dosing<br>
agent is absent.<br>
[0013] In further features, the control module diagnoses the sensor<br>
fault when a quantity of the dosing agent injected into an exhaust stream<br><br>
between a first time and a second time is less than a predetermined quantity.<br>
The first time corresponds to when the second dosing agent sensor transitions to<br>
indicating that the dosing agent is absent while the first dosing agent sensor<br>
indicates that the dosing agent is present. The second time is after the first time<br>
when the first dosing agent sensor transitions to indicating that the dosing agent<br>
is absent.<br>
[0014] A method comprises indicating whether a dosing agent is<br>
present at first, second, and third volumetric levels of a dosing agent tank using<br>
first, second, and third dosing agent sensors, respectively, and selectively<br>
diagnosing a sensor fault in at least one of the first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors based on the indications. The second volumetric level is greater<br>
than the first volumetric level, and the third volumetric level is greater than the<br>
second volumetric level.<br>
[0015] In other features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when the indicating comprises indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is present at the third volumetric level and that the dosing agent is<br>
absent at at least one of the first and second volumetric levels.<br>
[0016] In still other features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when the indicating comprises indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is present at the second volumetric level and that the dosing agent<br>
is absent at the first volumetric level.<br>
[0017] In further features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when the indicating transitions to indicating that the<br><br>
dosing agent is absent at the first volumetric level while indicating that the dosing<br>
agent is present at the second level.<br>
[0018] In still further features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when the indicating transitions to indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is absent at the second volumetric level while indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is present at the third volumetric level.<br>
[0019] In other features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when the indicating transitions to indicating that the<br>
dosing agent is absent at the first volumetric level while a pump pressure is<br>
greater than a predetermined pressure.<br>
[0020] In still other features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>
diagnosing the sensor fault when a quantity of the dosing agent injected into an<br>
exhaust stream between a first time and a second time is less than a<br>
predetermined quantity. The first time corresponds to when the indicating<br>
transitions to indicating that the dosing agent is absent at the third volumetric<br>
level while indicating that the dosing agent is present at the second volumetric<br>
level. The second time is after the first time when the indicating comprises<br>
indicating that the dosing agent is absent at the second volumetric level.<br>
[0021] In further features, the selectively diagnosing comprises<br>

transitions to indicating that the dosing agent is absent at the second volumetric<br><br>
level while indicating that the dosing agent is present at the first volumetric level.<br>
The second time is after the first time when the indicating transitions to indicating<br>
that the dosing agent is absent at the first volumetric level.<br>
[0022] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0030] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0031] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIG. 1, a urea tank 10 stores urea and<br>
includes sensors 12, 14 and 16, which may also be referred to herein as sensor<br>
1 (or S1), sensor 2 (or S2), and sensor 3 (or S3), respectively. The urea tank 10<br>
stores urea that is injected into an exhaust system of a diesel engine (not<br>
shown). The sensors 12, 14, and 16 sense the presence or absence of urea<br>
adjacent thereto and generate first and second signal states based thereon.<br>
While the foregoing description describes sensors with a high state in the<br>
presence of urea, a low state may also be used to signify the presence of urea.<br>
[0033] The sensor 12 is arranged to sense urea in the urea tank 10<br>
below the sensors 14 and 16. The sensor 14 is arranged to sense urea in the<br><br>
urea tank 10 between the sensor 12 and 16. The sensor 16 is arranged to sense<br>
urea in the urea tank 10 above the sensors 12 and 14. A control module 18<br>
receives outputs of the sensors 12, 14, and 16 and performs diagnostics on the<br>
sensor outputs to determine sensor faults and verify the sensor outputs. A pump<br>
20 pumps urea and a pressure sensor 22 senses pump pressure. As can be<br>
appreciated, the control module 18 may be implemented by an engine control<br>
module or other vehicle control module.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary functional block diagram<br>
of the control module 18 of FIG. 1 is shown in further detail. The control module<br>
18 may include an invalid level check module 24, a sensor stuck high check<br>
module 26, a first stuck low check module 30 and a second stuck low check<br>
module 34. A sensor fault module 38 generates a sensor fault based on outputs<br>
of the modules 24, 26, 30, and 34, as will be described further below. For<br>
example only, the sensor fault module 38 may generate a sensor fault signal, set<br>
a flag in diagnostic memory, illuminate a light (e.g., a "check engine" light), and/or<br>
generate any other indicator of a sensor fault.<br>
[0035] The invalid level check module 24 compares combined sensor<br>
states of the sensors 12, 14, and 16 to a table. The table identifies whether the<br>
sensor states correspond to a valid combined sensor state for the sensors 12,<br>
14, and 16 or an invalid combined sensor state for the sensors 12, 14, and 16. In<br>
addition, the other modules 26, 30, and 34 perform further diagnostics as will be<br>
described further below.<br><br>
[0036] The stuck high check module 26 determines whether any of the<br>
sensors 12, 14, and 16 are stuck in a high state. The sensor stuck high check<br>
module 26 selectively asserts first (or S1), second (or S2), and third (or S3) stuck<br>
high signals when the sensors 12, 14, and 16 are in a stuck high state,<br>
respectively. The sensor stuck high check module 26 may also receive a pump<br>
pressure signal from the urea pump and a pump pressure calibration signal. The<br>
stuck high state determination may be based on these values.<br>
[0037] The first stuck low check module 30 determines whether the<br>
sensors 14 and 16 are in a stuck low state. The first stuck low check module 30<br>
may base the determination on a urea quantity calculation generated by the<br>
control module 18 and whether or not urea was injected since a first combined<br>
sensor state transition.<br>
[0038] The second stuck low check module 34 determines whether the<br>
sensor 12 is in a stuck low state. The second stuck low check module 34 may<br>
also base the determination on the urea quantity calculation and whether or not<br>
urea was injected since a second combined sensor state transition.<br>
[0039] Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary invalid level check<br>
module 24 is shown. Valid combined sensor states may correspond to combined<br>
sensor states 111, 011, 001, and 000. Invalid combined sensor states may<br>
correspond to combined sensor states 110, 101, 100, and 010. In each of these<br>
combined sensor states, the sensor 16 appears first followed by the sensor 14<br>
and then the sensor 12.<br><br>
[0040] Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary functional block diagram<br>
of the sensor stuck high check module 26 is shown. The sensor stuck high<br>
check module 26 determines whether there has been a transition from the<br>
combined sensor state of 111 to the combined sensor state of 101. If true, then<br>
a stuck high signal is generated for the sensor 16.<br>
[0041] The sensor stuck high check module 26 also determines<br>
whether a transition has occurred from the combined sensor state of 011 to the<br>
combined sensor state of 010. If true, then the sensor stuck high check module<br>
26 generates a stuck high signal for the sensor 14. The sensor stuck high check<br>
module 26 also determines whether there has been a transition from the<br>
combined sensor state of 001 to the combined sensor state of 000. If false, the<br>
sensor stuck high check module 26 compares the pump pressure to the pump<br>
pressure calibration. If the pump pressure is less than or equal to the pump<br>
pressure calibration and the transition from the combined sensor state of 001 to<br>
the combined sensor state of 000 has not occurred, the sensor stuck high check<br>
module 26 generates a stuck high signal for the sensor 12.<br>
[0042] Referring now to "FIG. 5, an exemplary first stuck low check<br>
module 30 is shown. The first stuck low check module 30 compares urea<br>
injected since transitioning to the state of 011 to a urea quantity calibration. If the<br>
urea injected is less than or equal to the urea quantity calibration and the current<br>
state is equal to the combined sensor state of 001, then a stuck low signal is<br>
generated for the sensor 14.  A stuck low condition for the sensor 16 is<br><br>
undetectable. However, a customer may receive a low urea warning indication<br>
even when the urea tank has been filled.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 6, an exemplary functional block diagram<br>
of the second stuck low check module 34 and the sensor fault module 38 are<br>
shown. The second stuck low check module 34 compares urea injected since<br>
transitioning to the combined sensor state of 001 to a urea quantity calibration. If<br>
the urea injected is less than or equal to the urea quantity calibration and the<br>
current state is equal to the combined sensor state of 000, then a stuck low<br>
signal is generated for the sensor 12.<br>
[0044] Outputs of the invalid combined sensor states generated by the<br>
invalid level check module 24, the stuck high signals, and the stuck low signals<br>
are input to the sensor fault module 38. The sensor fault module 38 may include<br>
an OR gate, which outputs a sensor fault when any of these signals are asserted.<br>
[0045] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification, and the following claims.<br><br>

volumetric level.<br><br>
A sensor diagnostic system comprises first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors and a control module. The first, second, and third dosing agent<br>
sensors indicate whether a dosing agent is present at first, second, and third<br>
volumetric levels of a dosing agent tank, respectively. The second volumetric<br>
level is greater than the first volumetric level and the third volumetric level is<br>
greater than the second volumetric level. The control module selectively<br>
diagnoses a sensor fault in at least one of the first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors based on the indications of the first, second, and third dosing<br>
agent sensors.</td>
