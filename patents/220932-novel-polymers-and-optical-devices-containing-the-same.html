Novel Polymers for Use in Optical Devices<br>
The present invention relates to novel polymers comprising pyrimidine containing repeating units and to their use in optical devices, such as an optical device comprising an electroluminescent device or a photovoltaic device.<br>
Derivatives of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) have been known for some time as electroluminescence (EL) materials (see, for example, WO90/13148).<br>
W098/11150 discloses triazine polymers of formula  electroluminescence (EL) arrangements.<br>
US-A-5,876,864 relates to fluorene-based alternating polymers and and their use as electroluminescence materials.<br>
M. M. Koton et al., Vysokomolekulyarnye Soedin.; Seriya B: Kratkie Soobshcheniya, vol. 30, no. 10, 1978, 792-793 disclose polyimides on the basis of 2-phenyl-4,6-bis(p-<br><br><br><br><br>
E<br>
WO02/059121 discloses monomers having formula  S, NR, RC-CR, or RC=CR, Ar is an aryl or heteroaryl group, and E is a reactive group capable of undergoing chain extension and their use for the production of polymers which can be used in optical devices (see also WO01/62869).<br>
DE-A-19651439 (US-A-6,323,373) relates to polymerizable biaryl derivatives of the formula<br><br>
where the symbols and indices have the following meanings:<br>
X: -CH2-Z, -CHO;<br>
Y\Y2,Y3:CH;N,<br>
Z: identical or different, I, CI, Br, CN, SCN, NCO, PO(OR1)2, PO(R2)2, P(R3)3+ A";<br>
Aryl: an aryl group having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms;<br>
R', R": identical or different, CN, F, CI, a straight-chain or branched or cyclic alkyl or alkoxy<br>
group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, where one or more nonadjacent CH2 groups is<br>
optionally replaced by -0-, -S-, -CO-, -COO-, -0-CO-, -NR4-, -(NR5R6)+A" or -CONR7- and<br>

m:0,1 or 2;<br>
n: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 and their use for the production of polymers.<br>
There are a number of challenges faced with the introduction of organic EL displays when their performance is compared with existing technologies. Obtaining the exact color coordinates required by specific guidelines (i.e. NTSC) has been problematic. The<br><br>
operational lifetime of the EL device is relatively lower when contrasted to the existing inorganic technology. In addition, producing a material with a pure blue color and a long lifetime is one of the greatest problems for this industry.<br>
Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide novel materials, which show significant advantages in color purity, device efficiency and/or operational lifetime, when incorporated in optical devices.<br>
Said object, is solved by the polymers of the present invention comprising diazine, especially pyrimidine, containing repeating units. Optical devices, comprising the polymers of the present invention, can show significant advantages in color purity, device efficiency and/or operational lifetime. In addition, the polymers can have good solubility characteristics and relatively high glass transition temperatures, which facilitates their fabrication into coatings and films that are relatively thin, thermally stable, and relatively free of defects. If the polymers contain end groups which are capable of being crosslinked, the crosslinking of such groups after the films or coating is formed increases the solvent resistance thereof, which is beneficial in applications wherein one or more solvent-based layers of material are deposited thereon.<br>
Accordingly, the polymers of the present invention should have a glass transition temperature above 100°C, especially a glass transition temperature above 150°C.<br>
As used herein the term "polymer of the present invention" refers to polymers having repeating units of formula I, including formula la and lb, and/or II, including formula I la, lib and He.<br>

If a substituent, such as, for example R6f R7, R56 and R57, occurs more than one time in a formula, it can be different in each occurrence.<br><br><br><br>
hours. Organic bases, such as, for example, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and phase transfer catalysts, such as, for exampleTBAB, can promote the activity of the boron (see, for example, Leadbeater &amp; Marco; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2003, 42, 1407 and references cited therein). Other variations of reaction conditions are given by T. I. Wallow and B. M. Novak in Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 59, pp. 5034-5037 (1994); and M. Remmers, M. Schulze, and G. Wegner in Macromolecular Rapid Communications, Vol. 17, pp. 239-252 (1996).<br><br>
Polymerization processes involving only dihalo-functional reactants may be carried out using nickel coupling reactions. One such coupling reaction was described by Colon et al. in Journal of Polymer Science, Part A, Polymer Chemistry Edition, Vol. 28, p. 367 (1990), and by Colon et al. in Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 51, p. 2627 (1986). The reaction is typically conducted in a polar aprotic solvent (e.g., dimethylacetamide) with a catalytic amount of nickel salt, a substantial amount of triphenylphosphine and a large excess of zinc dust. A variant of this process is described by loyda et al. in Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan, Vol. 63, p. 80 (1990) wherein an organo-soluble iodide was used as an accelerator. Another nickel-coupling reaction was disclosed by Yamamoto in Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 17, p. 1153 (1992) wherein a mixture of dihaloaromatic compounds were treated with an excess amount of nickel (1,5-cyclooctadiene) complex in an inert solvent. All nickel-coupling reactions when applied to reactant mixtures of two or more aromatic dihalides yield essentially random copolymers. Such polymerization reactions may be terminated by the addition of small amounts of water to the polymerization reaction mixture, which will replace the terminal halogen groups with hydrogen groups. Alternatively, a monofunctional aryl halide may be used as a chain-terminator in such reactions, which will result in the formation of a terminal aryl group.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the polymers of the invention contain conjugated groups other than the pyrimidine groups described above. "Conjugated groups" refer to moieties containing double bonds, triple bonds and/or aromatic rings. Examples of such groups are the above mentioned co-monomers T. The incorporation of such groups into the polymer may be used to modify the light absorption, ionization potential, and/or electronic properties of the polymer. Such polymers may be prepared using the methods described above incorporating at least one conjugated compound different from the pyrimidine compounds described above. Such conjugated compounds, hereinafter referred to as "comonomers", have functional groups which permit them to copolymerize with the pyrimidine compounds. For example, dihalo-functional comonomers are preferably used in conjunction with dihalo-functional pyrimidine compounds in nickel-coupling polymerization reactions; dihalo-functional comonomers are preferably used in conjunction with pyrimidine-diboronic acids or pyrimidine-diboronates; and conjugated comonomers bearing diboronic acid or diboronate functionalities are preferably used in conjunction with dihalopyrimidines. For the purpose of preparing polymers of the invention, more than one diboronic acid/diboronate and more than one dibromide may be used in a Suzuki polymerization reaction so long as the total molar amount of diboronic acids/diboronates is essentially equivalent to the total amount of dibromides.<br>
Nickel-coupling polymerizations yield essentially random copolymers comprising pyrimidine group-containing units and units derived from other co-monomers, while Suzuki polymerizations yield alternating copolymers.<br>
It is possible to control the sequencing of the monomeric units in the resulting copolymer by controlling the order and composition of monomer feeds in the Suzuki reaction. For instance, a high molecular weight copolymer comprising mainly large blocks of pyrimidine homopolymers connected to short blocks of alternating pyrimidine co-monomer oligomers may be made by first introducing into the reaction reactants in the appropriate ratio to make the alternating pyrimidine-comonomer oligomers followed by the remainder of pyrimidine monomers so long as there is an overall balance of boronic and bromo groups.<br>
Usually the polymers of the present invention comprise end moieties E\ wherein E1 is hydrogen or an aryl moiety which may optionally be substituted with a reactive group capable of undergoing chain extension or crosslinking, or a tri(CrC18)alkylsiloxy group. As used herein, a reactive group capable of undergoing chain extension or crosslinking refers to any group which is capable of reacting with another of the same group or another group so as to<br><br>
form a link to prepare oligomers or polymers. Preferably, such reactive group is a hydroxy, glycidyl ether, acrylate ester, methacrylate ester, ethenyl, ethynyl, maleimide, nadimide, trifluorovinyl ether moiety or a cyclobutene moiety fused to the aromatic ring of E1.<br>
The polymers of the present invention, where E1 are reactive groups as defined above, are capable of crosslinking to form solvent resistant, heat-resistant films at 100°C or more, more preferably at 150°C or more. Preferably, such crosslinking occurs at 350°C or less, more preferably 300°C or less and most preferably 250°C or less. The crosslinkable polymers of the invention are stable at 100°C or more and more preferably 150°C or more. "Stable" as used herein means that such polymers do not undergo crosslinking or polymerization reactions at or below the stated temperatures. If a crosslinkable material is desired, E1 is preferably a vinylphenyl, an ethynylphenyl, or 4-(or 3-)benzocyciobutenyi radical. In another embodiment, E is selected from a group of phenolic derivatives of the formula -C6H4-0-Y, wherein Y is<br><br>
The end-capping agent E1-X (E1 is as defined above and X is either CI or Br) is incorporated into the polymers of the present invention under the condition in which the resulting polymers are substantially capped by the reactive group E1. The reactions useful for this purpose are the nickel-coupling and Suzuki reactions described above. The average degree of polymerization is controlled by the mole ratio of monomers to end-capping agent.<br>
Depending on the process of preparation the polymers of the present invention can be homopolymers, block copolymers, random copolymers, or alternating copolymers.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is related to polymer blends containing t to 99 percent of at least one pyrimidine containing polymers of this invention. The remainder 1 percent to 99 percent of the blend is composed of one or more polymeric materials selected from among chain growth polymers such as polystyrene, polybutadiene, poly(methyi methacrylate)h and poly(ethylene oxide); step-growth polymers such as phenoxy resins, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes, and polyimides; and crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked epoxy resins, crosslinked phenolic resins, crosslinked acrylate resins, and<br><br>
crossiinked urethane resins. Examples of these polymers may be found in Preparative Methods of Polymer Chemistry, W. R. Sorenson and T. W. Campbell, Second Edition, Interscience Publishers (1968). Also may be used in the blends are conjugated polymers such as poly(phenylene vinylene), substituted poly(phenylene vinylene)s, substituted polyphenylenes and polythiophenes. Examples of these conjugated polymers are given by Greenham and Friend in Solid State Physics, Vol. 49, pp. 1-149 (1995).<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the films formed from the polymers of the invention. Such films can be used in polymeric light-emitting diodes. Preferably, such films are used as emitting layers. These polymers may also be used as protective coatings for electronic devices and as fluorescent coatings. The thickness of the coating or film is dependent upon the ultimate use. Generally, such thickness can be from 0.01 to 200 microns. In that embodiment wherein the coating is used as a fluorescent coating, the coating or film thickness is from 50 to 200 microns. In that embodiment where the coatings are used as electronic protective layers, the thickness of the coating can be from 5 to 20 microns. In that embodiment where the coatings are used in a polymeric light-emitting diode, the thickness of the layer formed is 0.05 to 2 microns. The polymers of the invention form good pinhole- and defect-free films. Such films can be prepared by means well known in the art including spin-coating, spray-coating, dip-coating and roller-coating. Such coatings are prepared by a process comprising applying a composition to a substrate and exposing the applied composition to conditions such that a film is formed. The conditions which form a film depend upon the application technique and the reactive end groups of the aryl moiety. In a preferred embodiment, the composition applied to the substrate comprises the pyrimidine polymers dissolved in a common organic solvent. Preferably, the solution contains from 0.1 to 10 weight percent of the polymers. This composition is applied to the appropriate substrate by the desired method and the solvent is allowed to evaporate. Residual solvent may be removed by vacuum and/or by heat. After removal of the solvent, the coating is then exposed to the necessary conditions to cure the film, if needed, to prepare a film having high solvent and heat resistance. The films are preferably substantially uniform in thickness and substantially free of pinholes. In another embodiment, the polymers may be partially cured. This is known as B-staging.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is directed to an optical device or a component therefore, comprising a substrate and a polymer according to the present invention.<br><br>
A device according to the present invention may be prepared in accordance with the disclosure of WO99/48160, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. Polymers according to the present invention may be present in the device as the sole light emitting polymer or as a component in a blend further comprising hole and/or electron transporting polymers. Alternatively, the device may comprise distinct layers of a polymer of the present invention, a hole transporting polymer and/or an electron transporting polymer.<br>
In one embodiment the optical device comprises an electroluminescent device, which comprises<br>
(a)	a charge injecting layer for injecting positive charge carriers,<br>
(b)	a charge injecting layer for injecting negative charge carriers,<br>
(c)	a light-emissive layer located between the layers (a) and (b) comprising a polymer according to the present invention.<br>
The layer (a) may be a positive charge carrier transport layer which is located between the light emissive layer (c) and an anode electrode layer, or may be an anode electrode layer. The layer (b) may be a negative charge carrier transport layer which is located between the light emissive layer (c) and an cathode electrode layer, or may be an cathode electrode layer. Optionally, an organic charge transport layer can be located between the light emissive layer (c) and one of the charge carrier injecting layers (a) and (b).<br>
The EL device emits light below 520 nm, especially between 380 nm and 520 nm.<br>
The EL device has a NTSC coordinate of between about (0.12, 0.05) and about (0.16, 0.10), especially a NTSC coordinate of about (0.14,0.08).<br>
It will be appreciated that the light emissive layer may be formed from a blend or mixture of materials including one or more polymers according to the present invention, and optionally further different polymers. The further different polymers may be so-called hole transport polymers (i.e. to improve the efficiency of hole transport to the light-emissive material) or electron-transport polymers (i.e. to improve the efficiency of electron transport to the light-emissive material). Preferably, the blend or mixture would comprise at least 0.1 % by weight of a polymer according to the present invention, preferably from 0.2 to 50%, more preferably from 0.5 to 30% by weight.<br><br>
An organic EL device typically consists of an organic film sandwiched between an anode and a cathode such that when a positive bias is applied to the device, holes are injected into the organic film from the anode, and electrons are injected into the organic film from the cathode. The combination of a hole and an electron may give rise to an exciton, which may undergo radiative decay to the ground state by liberating a photon. In practice the anode is commonly an mixed oxide of tin and indium for its conductivity and transparency. The mixed oxide (ITO) is deposited on a transparent substrate such as glass or plastic so that the light emitted by the organic film may be observed. The organic film may be the composite of several individual layers each designed for a distinct function. Since holes are injected from the anode, the layer next to the anode needs to have the functionality of transporting holes. Similarly, the layer next to the cathode needs to have the functionality of transporting electrons. In many instances, the hole-(electron) transporting layer also acts as the emitting layer. In some instances one layer can perform the combined functions of hole and electron transport and light emission. The individual layers of the organic film may be all polymeric in nature or combinations of films of polymers and films of small molecules deposited by thermal evaporation. It is preferred that the total thickness of the organic film be less than 1000 nanometers (nm). It is more preferred that the total thickness be less than 500 nm. It is most preferred that the total thickness be less than 300 nm. It is preferred that the thickness of the active (light emitting) layer be less than 400 nanometers (nm). It is more preferred that the thickness is in the range of from 40 to 160 nm.<br>
The ITO-glass which serves as the substrate and the anode may be used for coating after the usual cleaning with detergent, organic solvents and UV-ozone treatment. It may also be first coated with a thin layer of a conducting substance to facilitate hole injection. Such substances include copper phthalocyanine, polyaniline and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDT); the last two in their conductive forms by doping with a strong organic acid, e.g., poly(styrenesulfonic acid). It is preferred that the thickness of this layer be 200 nm or less; it is more preferred that the thickness be 100 nm or less.<br>
In the cases where a hole-transporting layer is used, the polymeric arylamines described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,801, may be used. Other known hole-conducting polymers, such as polyvinylcarbazole, may also be used. The resistance of this layer to erosion by the solution of the copolymer film which is to be applied next is obviously critical to the successful fabrication of multi-layer devices. The thickness of this layer may be 500 nm or less, preferably 300 nm or less, most preferably 150 nm or less.<br><br>
In the case where an electron-transporting layer is used, it may be applied either by thermal evaporation of low molecular weight materials or by solution coating of a polymer with a solvent that would not cause significant damage to the underlying film.<br>
Examples of low molecular weight materials include the metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline (as described by Burrows et al. in Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 64, pp. 2718-2720 (1994)), metallic complexes of 10-hydroxybenzo(h)quinoline (as described by Hamada et al. in Chemistry Letters, pp. 906-906 (1993)), 1,3,4-oxadiazoles (as described by Hamada et al. in Optoelectronics-Devices and Technologies, Vol. 7, pp. 83-93 (1992)), 1,3,4-triazoles (as described by Kido et al. in Chemistry Letters, pp. 47-48 (1996)), and dicarboximides of perylene (as described by Yoshida et al. in Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 69, pp. 734-736(1996)).<br>
Polymeric electron-transporting materials are exemplified by 1,3,4-oxadiazole-containing polymers (as described by Li et al. in Journal of Chemical Society, pp. 2211-2212 (1995), by Yang and Pei in Journal of Applied Physics, Vol 77, pp. 4807-4809 (1995)), 1,3,4-triazole-containing polymers (as described by Strukelj et al. in Science, Vol. 267, pp. 1969-1972 (1995)), quinoxaline-containing polymers (as described by Yamamoto et al. in Japan Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 33, pp. L250-L253 (1994), O'Brien et al. in Synthetic Metals, Vol. 76, pp. 105-108 (1996)), and cyano-PPV (as described by Weaver et al. in Thin Solid Films, Vol. 273, pp. 39-47 (1996)). The thickness of this layer may be 500 nm or less, preferably 300 nm or less, most preferably 150 nm or less.<br>
The metallic cathode may be deposited either by thermal evaporation or by sputtering. The thickness of the cathode may be from 100 nm to 10,000 nm. The preferred metals are calcium, magnesium, indium, and aluminum. Alloys of these metals may also be used. Alloys of aluminum containing 1 to 5 percent of lithium and alloys of magnesium containing at least 80 percent of magnesium are preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the electroluminescent device comprises at least one hole-transporting polymer film and a light-emitting polymer film comprised of the polymer of the invention, arranged between an anode material and a cathode material such that under an applied voltage, holes are injected from the anode material into the hole-transporting polymer film and electrons are injected from the cathode material into the light-emitting polymer films when the device is forward biased, resulting in light emission from the light-emitting layer.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, layers of hole-transporting polymers are arranged so that the layer closest to the anode has the lower oxidation potential, with the adjacent layers having progressively higher oxidation potentials. By these methods, electroluminescent devices having relatively high light output per unit voltage may be prepared.<br>
The term "hole-transporting polymer film" as used herein refers to a layer of a film of a polymer which when disposed between two electrodes to which a field is applied and holes are injected from the anode, permits adequate transport of holes into the emitting polymer.

In the case of using a metal or a metallic alloy as a material for an electrode, the electrode can be formed also by the vacuum deposition method. In the case of using a metal or a metallic alloy as a material forming an electrode, the electrode can be formed, furthermore, by the chemical plating method (see for example, Handbook of Electrochemistry, pp 383-387, Mazuren, 1985). In the case of using an electroconducting polymer, an electrode can be made by forming it into a<br><br>
film by means of anodic oxidation polymerization method onto a substrate, which is previously provided with an electroconducting coating.<br>

Application Example 1<br>
The ITO-glass used for device fabrication has a nominal sheet resistance of 12 ohm/square. The hole injection conducting polymer when used is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDT), the hole-transporting polymer when used is poly(4,4,-biphenylene-diyl-N'Nl-diphenyldiamino-1,4-phenylene) described in US-B-5.728,801, hereinafter abbreviated as "P3DA", and the electron-transporting layer when used is the aluminum complex of 8-hydroxy-quinoline hereinafter abbreviated as •Alq". Films of PEDT are formed by spin coating from aqueous solutions of the polymer obtained from Bayer Corporation. Films of P3DA are formed by spin coating from chlorobenzene solutions. Alq films are formed by thermal evaporation in high vacuum. Multi-layer devices are fabricated by laying, down the layers<br><br>
sequentially starting from the layer next to the ITO. After all the layers have been deposited, the appropriate metallic cathodes are then deposited on top of the organic film by thermal evaporation. Magnesium alloys in this instance are alloys of magnesium containing at least 85 percent of magnesium. The active polymer is deposited by spin-coating from organic solution (toluene).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
