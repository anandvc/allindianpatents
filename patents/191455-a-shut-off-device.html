				<td>This    invention    relates    to    a    shut-off    device    for    a tap,   cock  or   faucet.<br>
Discussion  of   the  Prior  Art<br>
There   are  a  number  of   types   of   cocks,   taps   and faucets   that   include  a  valve  member  and  associated  seal  to control   flow  of  fluids   that  may  be   liquid  or  gases.     The complexity  of   such  valve  mechanisms  vary  enormously  but there   is   always   a  need   for  a   simple  hard  wearing   shut-off mechanism  with  replaceable  sealing  components.      It   is  these considerations   that  have  brought  about  the  present invention. Summary  of  the  Invention<br>
According  to  the  present   invention  there   is provided  a  shut-off  mechanism  for  a  tap,   cock  or  faucet comprising  an  axially  rotatable  spindle   supported  within  a casing  adapted  to  be  attached  to  a  body  of  the  tap  cock  or faucet,   a  sealing  member  displaceable  on  rotation  of  the spindle  to  engage  an  associated  seat  in  the  tap  cock  or faucet  body,   an  O-ring  being  positioned  between  the  spindle and  the  casing.   The  sealing  member  being  furnished  on  one end  of   a  carriage  that   is   in  threadetd  engagement  with  the spindle  whereby  rotation  of   the   spindle   imparts   linear displacement   to   the   carriage,   characterised   in  that   the sealing  member   is   replaceable   and   is   a  press   fit   onto   the end  of   the   carriage,   and   the   cap  member   engages   and   locates the  O-ring  between  the   spindle  and  casing.  .<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a shut-off device for a tap, cock or faucet, comprising an axially rotatable spindle (11) supported within a casing (20) attached to a body of the tap, cock or faucet, a sealing member (40) displaceable on rotation of the spindle to engage an   associated   seat   in   the   tap,    cock   or   faucet   body,    an   O-ring<br>
(36)	positioned   between   a   shoulder    (14)    on   the    spindle    (11)<br>
and   the   casing    (20),    the   sealing   member   being   replaceable   and<br>
a    press    fit    onto    one    end    of    the    carriage     (30)     that    is    in<br>
threaded   engagement   with   the   spindle    (11)    whereby   rotation   of<br>
the   spindle    (11)    imparts   linear   displacement   to   the   carriage<br>
(30) ,     characterized    in    that    a    replaceable    end   bonnet   member<br>
(37)	is located on a step (16) of the spindle (11) wholly<br>
within the casing (20) to locate the O-ring (36) between the<br>
spindle   (11)   and  casing   (20).<br>
BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  ACCOMPANYING  DRAWING<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a cross-sectional view of a shut-off  mechanism  for   a  valve   assembly.<br>
Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiment<br>
The  accompanying  drawing  is  a  cross-sectional view  of  a  shut-off  mechanism  10   for  a  valve  assembly.     The mechanism  is  adapted  to  be  attached  to  a  variety  of  types of  cocks  or  faucets  such  as  a  bib  cock,   a  stop  cock  or  a pillar  cock  more  usually  known  as  a  basin  tap.     The  shut-off  mechanism  can  also  be  used  with  other  types  of  taps such  as  mixer  taps.     The  shut-off  mechanism  10  cuts  off  and controls  flow  of  fluids  usually  liquids.     The  mechanism includes  a  displaceable  valve  member  that  is  adapted  to seat  against  a  valve  seat  not  shown  to  cut  off  flow  of fluid.<br>
As  shown  in  the  drawing,   the  mechanism  10 essentially  comprises  an  axially  rotatable  spindle  11  that is  coupled  to  a  handle  12,   the  spindle  being  rotatable within  a  casing  20  which  is  adapted  to  be  threadedly secured  to  the  body  of  the  tap  or  cock  not  shown.     The spindle  11  threadedly  engages  a  carriage  30  that  in  turn carries  a  sealing  member  40.     The  arrangement  is  such  as that  rotation  of  a  handle  12  causes  rotation  of  the  spindle 11  to  displace  the  carriage  30   longitudinally  of  the spindle  11  to  force  the  sealing  member  31  against  a  seat not  shown  to  effect  the  shut-off  mechanism.     Reverse rotation  of  the  handle  draws  the  sealing  member  40  back  to the  position  shown  in  the  drawing  and  clear  of  the  seat  to open  the  valve  assembly  and  allow  flow  of  fluid.<br>
The  components  of  the  shut-off  mechanism  10  are preferably  constructed  in  polymeric  materials  and particularly  high  grade  engineering  polymers  that  have proven  characteristics  of  durability  and  reliability.     The casing  or  bonnet  20   is  a  cylindrical  body  with  a  stepped internal  bore  21  terminating  in  a  neck  portion  22   at  one end  and  being  externally  threaded  at  the  other  lower  end 23.     The  external  threading  is  suitable  to  allow  the  casing 20   to  be  screwed  into  the  body  of  a  valve  or  tap  not  shown. The  casing  20  has  a  hexagonal   outer  ring  24   to  facilitate<br>
location  by  means  of  a  spanner.     A  cylindrical  spindle  11 is  located  coaxially  within  the  casing  20   to  be  axially rotatable  within  the  casing.     The  spindle  is  a substantially  hollow  member  having  an  externally  threaded forward  end  13  which  merges   into  a  shoulder  14   and  stepped shank  15.     The  step  16  on  the  shank  15  is  of  greater diameter  than  the  aperture  in  the  neck  22  of  the  casing  20 to  prevent  displacement  of  the  spindle   11  out  of  the  casing 20.<br>
The  upper  end  of  the  spindle  11  is  arranged  to  be a  sealed  rotational  fit  within  the  bore  of  the  carriage  by the  provision  of  an  O-ring  36  that  sits  against  the shoulder  14  on  the  spindle  and  is  located  in  position  by  a cap  member  37   that   locates  on  the  step  16  with  a  downwardly projecting  annular  flange  38  that   is  a  force  fit  onto  the shank  of  the  spindle  11.     The  cap  member  37   locates  the  CD-ring  36   in  position  and  acts  as  a  thrust  and  wear  plate  for the  mechanism.     Since  the  components  of  the  shut-off mechanism  are  moulded  in  polymeric  materials,   it   is important  that  there  is  no  parting  line  adjacent  the  O-ring 36  to  reduce  the  quality  of  that  seal.   The  use  of  the  cap member  37  ensures  that  the  spindle  can  be  moulded  in plastics  with  the  parting  line  terminating  at  the  shoulder 14.   The  shoulder  14  and  cap  37  act  as  the  means  of  locating the  O-ring  36  which  engages  the  smooth  wall  of  the  spindle above  the  shoulder  14.<br>
The  upper  end  of  the  shank  15   is   internally threaded  17   to  take  a  small  screw  18  which  is  countersunk into  an  end  boss   19  of  the  tap  handle  12.     A  removable  cap 9   seals  the  cavity  that  houses  the  screw  8.     The  underside of  the  handle  12   is  adjacent  the  top  of  the  casing  20   thus ensuring  that  the  spindle  is  free  to  rotate  axially  but constrained  against   longitudinal  displacement  relative  to the  casing.<br>
The  externally  threaded  lower  end  13  of   the spindle  11  threadedly  engages  an  internally  threaded  bore<br>
31  on  the  carriage  30.     The  carriage  is  arranged  to  be  a sliding  fit  within  the  bore  of  the  casing  20.     The internally  threaded  bore  31  terminates   in  a  closed  end  32 that  has  a  forwardly  projecting  head  33  of  mushroom configuration.     The  head  33  of  mushroom  configuration  is arranged  to  be  a  snap  fit  within  a  suitably  profiled  recess 41   in  the  sealing  member  40  which  has  a  diameter  that corresponds  to  the  diameter  of  the  carriage  30.     The sealing  member  40   is  also  provided  with  a  forwardly projecting  closed  end  42.     The  sealing  member  40  and  its engagement  with  the  mushroom  head  33  of  the  carriage  30 ensures  positive  and  effective   location  with  the  additional feature  of  simple  replaceability.     Clockwise  motion  of  the handle  12  causes  the  spindle  11  to  rotate  which  in  turn through  its  threaded  engagement  with  the  carriage  30  forces the  carriage  downwards  so  that  the  sealing  member  40  closes off   the  valve.     Conse<juently the spindle and carriage need a left hand thread. to ensure that does not simply turn with external periphery of is provided squared or hexagonal portion arranged be sliding fit within similarly profile interior casing in this way free slide longitudinally but cannot rotate relative casing.></juently>
It   is  understood  that   there  are  a  variety  of polymers  or  plastics  that  can  be  used  to  produce  the  shut-off  mechanism  described  above.      It   is  however  envisaged that  the  casing  20,   spindle   11  and  carriage  30  would  be made  of  acetal  whilst   the  cap  member  37   is  more   likely  to be  constructed  of  nylon.     The  sealing  member  40  would  be  a polyester  elastomer.     The  handle   12   is   likely  to  be  made  of a  non-corrosive  metal   such  as  brass.<br>
The  assembly  described  above   is   simple   in  its operation  and  designed  for  a  long  and  trouble-free  life. Should  the  seals  perished  or  break  down,   it   is  a  simple<br>
matter  to  remove  the  casing  20,   peel  off  and  replace  the sealing  member  40  and  replace  O-ring  seal  36  on  the  spindle 11.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
