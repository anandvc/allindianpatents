				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus for recording information signals, such as speech or video signals, on a disc, such as an optical disc, or reproducing the information signals recorded on the disc. More particularly, it relates to a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus for loading the disc using a disc tray moved across the inner side and the outer side of a casing. Description of the Related Art<br>
There has hitherto been used a disc player employing, as a recording medium, an optical disc having information signals, such as speech signals or video signals, recorded thereon. Among the disc players of this type, there is such disc player in which an optical disc with a diameter of 120 mm or 80 mm, having mainly music signals recorded thereon, referred to hereinafter as CD, and an optical disc with a diameter of 300 mm or 200 mm, having mainly video signals recorded thereon, referred to hereinafter as LD, can be selectively loaded for reproducing the information recorded on these discs.<br>
This disc player includes a disc tray having the optical disc set thereon and moved across the inner side and the outer side of a casing, a disc driving unit having an optical pickup<br><br>
for reproducing the information signals recorded on the disc, a loading mechanism for moving the disc tray across the inner and outer sides of the casing making up a main body portion of the disc player for loading the optical disc, and an adjustment mechanism for rotating a disc reproducing unit relative to the optical disc for adjusting the tilt of the optical axis of the light beam radiated by the optical pickup on the disc relative to the disc.<br>
The disc driving unit includes the optical pickup for converging the light beam radiated from the light source for radiating it on the optical disc, and a movement mechanism for moving the optical pickup radially of the optical disc. The loading mechanism includes a slider for moving the disc tray, a cam gear having a cam groove engaged by the slider, and a loading driving motor for rotating the cam gear. The adjustment for adjusting the tilt of the optical axis of the light beam relative to the disc includes a guide rail supporting the optical pickup, a supporting substrate rotatably supporting the guide rail, a rotary member for rotating the guide rail and a driving motor driving the rotary member. With the present disc player, the adjustment mechanism is driven by the driving motor and the optical pickup is tilted relative to the optical disc via the guide rail for adjusting the direction of the optical axis of the objective lens relative to the optical disc. The information signals recorded on the optical disc are read out by the optical<br><br>
pickup of the disc driving unit.<br>
Meanwhile, with the above-described disc player, if a disc set on the disc tray is loaded on the disc loading unit, the disc needs to be moved horizontally relative to the casing and subsequently in a direction approaching to the disc driving unit. This complicates the loading mechanism for the disc tray.<br>
In addition, the above-described disc player is provided with a driving motor for moving the disc tray across the inner and outer sides of the casing for loading the optical disc and another separate driving motor for driving the adjustment mechanism configured for adjusting the tilt relative to the 'disc of the optical axis of the light beam radiated from the optical pickup. Since plural driving motors are used, the mechanism becomes complicated, while the manufacturing cost is increased.<br>
Meanwhile, in the above-described disc player, a driving force connecting/disconnecting mechanism is provided between the adjustment mechanism and the driving motor, thus additionally complicating the structure.<br>
In addition, if, with the disc player, the loading mechanism should be repaired, the operation of adjusting the loading mechanism needs to be performed with the optical disc loaded on the disc driving unit. In this case, a loading mechanism having a cam gear for moving a pair of sliders is arranged on the bottom surface extending parallel to the disc tray setting surface. Therefore, if the disc tray is entrained into the casing, the<br><br>
loading mechanism is covered up with the disc tray.<br>
Thus, for repairing the loading mechanism, it becomes difficult to perform dismounting, adjustment and assembling of the loading mechanism with the disc tray entrained into the casing thus worsening workability in repair works or maintenance of the loading mechanism.<br>
In addition, since the above-described disc player has a mechanism of intermittently driving the slider by an intermittent gear, it becomes necessary to provide a slider holding mechanism for holding the slider in position when not driving the slider. The result is that the loading mechanism in its entirety becomes complex in structure to render it difficult to secure stable operation of the loading mechanism.<br>
Moreover, the casing of the dis player has an opening via which to pull out the disc tray, and a lid is provided for opening or closing the opening. If the player itself should be reduced in size in this case, the stroke of movement of the lid needs to be reduced. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

With the above-described driving mechanism 11, the operation of rotationally driving the control gear 33 by the driving motor 74 is hereinafter explained. By the driving shaft 74A of the driving motor 74 run in rotation, the second pulley 73 is run in rotation for rotationally driving the first pulley 72 via pulley belt 76. By the first pulley 72 run in rotation, the second gear portion 71B of the second gear 71 is run in rotation via gear portion 72B. By the second gear portion 71B of the second gear 71 run in rotation, the first gear portion 70A of the first gear 70 is run in rotation via first gear portion 71A. By the first<br><br>
gear portion 70A of the first gear 70 run in rotation, the first gear portion 33A of the control gear 33 is run in rotation via second gear portion 70B.<br>
With the above-described disc player 1, the opening/closure operation of opening/closing the aperture 3A by movement of the lid 19 by the opening/closure mechanism 7, the loading operation of the movement mechanism 8 entraining the disc tray 5 with the optical disc 2 set thereon into the inside of the casing 1, and the adjustment operation of the adjustment mechanism 10 adjusting the tilt of the light beam by rotating the guide rail 55, will be explained with reference to the drawings.<br>
First, by the control gear 33 rotated counterclockwise by the driving mechanism 11, as indicated by arrow Rl in Fig.8, the second gear 37B of the movement gear 30A is run in rotation clockwise as indicated by arrow R2 in Fig.8. By the second gear 37B of the movement gear 30A run in rotation as shown in Figs.8 and 9, the first gear portion 37A is run in rotation for moving the rack gear 18B of the disc tray 5. By the movement gear 30A run in rotation, the movement gear SOB is run in rotation via connecting shaft 39 for moving the rack gear 18B of the disc tray 5 by the gear portion 38 of the movement gear SOB.<br>
That is, the disc tray 5 is moved by the movement gears 30A, 3OB via rack gear 18B in the horizontal direction as indicated b yarrow X1 in Fig.8 so as to be housed within the casing 1.<br>
When the disc tray 5 is moved to a position housed within<br><br>
the casing l,by the movement gear 30A run in rotation, as shown in Fig.9, the cam protrusion 37C is enabled to be moved along the cam groove 35C of the frame 34A. Thus, by the cam protrusion 37C moved along the cam groove 35C, the movement gear 30A is lowered in a direction indicated by arrow A in Fig.10.<br>
By the movement gear 30A being lowered in the direction of arrow A in Fig.10, the supporting plates 31A, 31B are lowered in a direction indicated by arrow A in Fig.10. By the movement gear 30A being lowered in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 10, the second gear portion 37B becomes disengaged from the control gear 33.<br>
By the supporting plates 31A, 31B being lowered in the direction of arrow A in Fig.10, the actuating ribs 28A of the supporting arms 23A, 23B of the opening/closure mechanism 7 for the lid 19 are moved along the actuating slit 51 for starting the opening/closure operation of the aperture by the opening/closure mechanism 7.<br>
The slide plate 32A is moved by the control gear 33 rotated in the direction indicated by arrow Rl in Fig.10. Simultaneously, the engagement lug 50 is moved along the first cam groove 52A of the of the control gear 33 and along the guide grooves 35H of the frames 34A, 34B as far as the first inflection position PI where the curvature of the first cam groove 52A is changed.<br>
By the engagement lug 50 moved through the domain in the<br><br>
first cam groove 52A between the first inflection position PI and the second inflection position P2, the supporting plate 31A is moved in the direction of arrow B in Fig.10, while being lowered in the direction of arrow A in Fig.10. The supporting plates 31A, 31B, lowered in the direction of arrow A in Fig.10, lowers the disc tray 5 in the casing 1 to the disc reproducing position. By the slide plate 32A moved in the direction of arrow B in Fig.10, the rack gear 46 rotates the link gear 47A. By the link gear 47A, thus rotated, the link gear 47B is rotated via connection shaft 48, so that the slide plates 32A, 32B are moved in synchronism with each other.<br>
By the slide plates 32A, 32B moved in the direction of arrow B in Fig.10, the supporting protrusions 68A, 68B of the guide members 67A, 67B of the chuck mechanism 9 are moved along the second guide grove 45B and the fourth guide groove 45D for lowering the guide members 67A, 67B in the direction of arrow A in Fig.10.<br>
With the opening/closure mechanism 7 for the lid 19, when the disc tray 5 has been moved in the horizontal direction as far as the housing position in the casing 1, as shown in Figs.10 to 13, the supporting arms 23A, 23B are rotated by the tension coil springs 24A, 24B clockwise as indicated by arrow SI in Figs.10 and 12.<br>
By the supporting arms 23A, 23B rotated in the direction of arrow S1 in Figs.10 and 12, the sliders 22A, 22B are moved via<br><br>
engagement protrusion 25 inserted into the guide grove 28B under guidance by the guide grooves 35A, 35B of the frames 34A, 34B. By the sliders 22A, 22B moved under guidance by the guide grooves 35A, 35B, the supporting protrusions 26A, 26B of the movement plates 21A, 21B are slid along the guide grooves 27A, 27B. By the movement plates 21A, 21B thus slid, the lid 19 is moved via movement plate 20 to the position shown in Fig.12 for closing the aperture 3A with the lid 19.<br>
By the guide members 67A, 67B lowered, the chuck plate 65 is lowered so that the chuck member 55 holds the optical disc 2 set on the disc table 15, as shown in Fig.14.<br>
With the disc player 1, the adjustment mechanism 10 rotates the guide rail 55 depending on the tilt of the optical axis of the objective lens 14A of the optical pickup 14 relative to the optical disc 2 for adjusting the tilt of the light beam relative the optical disc 2 set on the disc table 15. The tilt adjustment of the light beam relative to the optical disc is hereinafter explained.<br>
Referring to Fig.14, after the lowering of the disc tray 5 comes to a close, the driving mechanism 11 further runs the control gear 33 in rotation counterclockwise in Fig.14 for driving the adjustment mechanism 1. By the control ear 33 run in rotation, the cam protrusion 59B of the movement plate 59 is moved along the second cam groove 52B and along the guide groove 35H of the frame 34A to reach the inflection position P3 where<br><br>
the curvature of the cam groove 52B is changed.<br>
By the cam protrusion 59B moved through the domain of the second cam groove 52B where the curvature is changed, the engagement lug 50 is moved, so that the slide plates 32A, 32B are moved in a direction shown by arrow B in Fig.15. By the slide plates 32A, 32B moved in a direction shown by arrow B in Fig. 15, the connection gear 60A is run in rotation via rack gear 46. By the connection gear 60A run in rotation, the connection gear GOB is rotated in unison via connecting shaft 64. The connection gear 60B, thus rotated, moves the rotation plate 58 in a direction of arrow B in Fig.15. The rotation plate 58, thus rotated in the direction of arrow B in Fig.15, moves the connection pin 57B of the rotary lever 57 in a direction indicated by arrow C in Fig.15. The rotary lever 57, rotated in the direction of arrow C in Fig.15, rotates the guide rail 55 via connection hole 57C. By the guide rail 55 rotated along the first to fifth guide holes 56A to 56E of the disc driving unit supporting substrate 56, the tilt of the optical axis of the objective lens 14A of the optical pickup 14 relative to the optical disc 2 is changed, thus adjusting the tilt of the light beam relative to the optical disc 2 set on the disc table 15.<br>
As described above, the adjustment mechanism 10 is responsive to a detection output of the skew sensor 14B detecting the tilt relative to the optical disc 2 of the optical axis of the light beam radiated from the light source on the optical disc<br><br>
2 to rotate the control gear 33 clockwise or counterclockwise for adjusting the tilt relative to the optical disc 2 of the optical axis of the objective lens 14A by the optical pickup 14 being rotated by the guide rail 55 rotated in the direction of arrow C or arrow D in Fig.15, thereby adjusting the tilt of the lightbeam relative to the optical disc 2.<br>
The state of the guide rail 55 shown in Fig.15 represents the limit of counterclockwise rotation of the guide rail in the direction of arrow D with the rotation protrusion 55C as the fulcrum of rotation. By the control gear 33 rotated counterclockwise in Fig.15 as indicated by arrow Rl, the guide rail 55 is rotated from the tilted state shown in Fig.15 to the tilted state shown in Fig.16 for gradually reducing the amount of tilt in the counterclockwise direction indicated by arrow D in Fig.15 .<br>
By the control gear 33 rotated further in the direction indicated by arrow Rl in Fig.15, the guide rail 55 is rotated from the tilted state shown in Fig.16 to the tilted state shown in Fig.17 so that the direction of tilt relative to the optical disc 2 is changed from the counterclockwise direction to the clockwise direction. By the guide rail 55 rotated from the tilted state shown in Fig.17 to the tilted state shown in Fig.18, the amount of tilt of the guide rail 55 in the clockwise direction is gradually increased. The tilt state of the guide rail 55 shown in Fig.18 is the state of maximum clockwise<br><br>
rotation as indicated by arrow C in Fig.18 about the rotation protrusion 55c as the center of rotation.<br>
Since the movement plate 59 is perpetually engaged with the control gear 33, the adjustment mechanism 10 is protected from adverse effects due to impact of descent or the like thus stabilizing the tilt adjustment of the light beam relative to the optical disc 2 for realizing improved reliability.<br>
Since the adjustment mechanism 10 is not provided with an elastic member for retreating pre-set direction, such as spring, during loading or unloading of the optical disc 2 for moving the disc tray 5, no difference is produced in the load of tilt adjustment of the light beam relative to the optical disc 2 caused by rotation of the control gear 33 dependent upon the direction of tilt of the guide rail 55, thus enabling stable tilt adjustment .<br>
With the above-described disc player 1 according to the present invention, since the movement mechanism 8 having the control gear 33 is provided on the lateral surface of the disc tray 5 normal to the setting surface for the optical disc 2, the operation of dismounting or assembling the movement mechanism 8 can be performed easily with the disc tray 5 housed within the casing 1, thus improving the operability in repair works or maintenance of the movement mechanism 8.<br>
In addition, since the entire movement mechanism 8 is simplified in structure, the loading operation is stabilized,<br><br>
thus improving the reliability in the loading operation.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is not limited to the disc player 1 but may be applied to a disc recording/reproducing apparatus for a bonded optical disc comprised of plural optical discs bonded together, or a re-recordable optical disc, such as a magneto-optical disc, with similar advantages to those obtained with the disc player.<br><br><br><br><br>
