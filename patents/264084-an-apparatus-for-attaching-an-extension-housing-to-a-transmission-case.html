FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicular transmission and more particularly<br>
to an apparatus for attaching an extension housing to a transmission case.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A typical multiple speed automatically shiftable vehicular transmission includes a<br>
housing or case having a plurality of planetary gear sets supported within the<br>
case. A plurality of fluid actuated clutches and brakes, operatively associated<br>
with various ring gears, sun gears, and planet carriers of the planetary gear sets,<br>
operate to establish various speed ratios or power flow paths through the<br>
transmission. Often, these clutches and brakes are arranged along longitudinal<br>
axes of the transmission with each including an annular cylinder for pressurized<br>
fluid and a complementary piston reciprocally movable to each cylinder for<br>
applying pressure to friction discs to effect clutching or braking. In order to<br>
structurally support fixed or rotating elements of those clutches and brakes<br>
located toward the middle of the case, it is customary to employ a structural<br>
member known as a center support. Typically, center supports are bolted or<br>
otherwise held with respect to the case and provide bearing surfaces for rotating<br>
elements. Additionally, an extension housing may be provided to close or seal<br>
one end of the transmission case. The extension housing is typically bolted to the<br>
case for additional support and to seal the case from fluid leakage.<br><br>
	By integrally casting the center support and the case, the stiffness of the<br>
case will tend to increase. However, the draft required from the center support to the rear<br>
of the case, for a typical casting operation, increases the diameter of the case. In some<br>
instances, this increase in the diameter of the case may make the placement of extension<br>
housing bolting bosses about the outside periphery of the case impossible or impractical<br>
due to vehicular packaging constraints.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	A transmission housing assembly includes a transmission case defining a<br>
bore that is sufficiently configured to receive a fastening block member. The fastening<br>
block member is secured with respect to the transmission case. Also provided is an<br>
extension housing sufficiently configured to receive at least one fastener. Each of the at<br>
least one fasteners operate to engage the fastening block member, thereby securing the<br>
extension housing with respect to the transmission case.<br>
	The fastening block member may be secured with respect to the<br>
transmission case by a retaining ring, such as a snap ring, disposed within a groove<br>
defined by the transmission case. A first seal, such as an elastomeric o-ring, may be<br>
disposed between the fastening block member and the transmission case. A second seal,<br>
such as an elastomeric o-ring, may be disposed between the fastening block member and<br>
the extension housing. A center support member may also be provided and is formed<br>
integrally with the transmission case. The fastening block member may pilot within the<br>
bore defined by the transmission case. Similarly, the extension housing may pilot within<br>
the bore defined by the transmission case.<br>
	Additionally, a transmission is provided having a transmission case<br>
defining a generally cylindrical bore sufficiently configured to pilot a fastening block<br>
member therein. An extension housing is also provided. An annular groove is defined<br>
by the transmission case and is sufficiently configured to receive a retaining ring. The<br>
retaining ring operates to limit the axial movement of the fastening block member within<br>
the bore. At least one fastener operates to engage the fastening block member to secure<br>
the extension housing with respect to the transmission case. The fastener urges the<br><br>
fastening block member against the retaining ring and, in reaction, the extension housing<br>
is drawn to the transmission case.<br>
	The extension housing may include a hub portion. The fastening block<br>
member defines a generally cylindrical bore sufficiently configured to receive at least a<br>
portion of the hub portion therein. A first seal may be disposed between the hub portion<br>
and the fastening block member. A second seal may be disposed between the<br>
transmission case and the fastening block member. The extension housing may also<br>
include a generally annular axially extending lip portion to pilot the extension housing<br>
into engagement with the generally cylindrical bore of the transmission case. A center<br>
support member, formed integrally with the transmission case, may also be provided.<br>
	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
	Figure 1 is a fragmentary cross sectional side elevational view of a<br>
vehicular transmission illustrating aspects consistent with the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
	Referring to Figure 1 there is shown a cross sectional side elevational view<br>
of a portion of a vehicular transmission, generally indicated at 10. The transmission 10 is<br>
an automatically shiftable power transmission, the operation of which is known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The transmission 10 includes a housing or case 12 that preferably<br>
incorporates a cast in place or integrally formed center support member 14 sufficiently<br>
configured to provide support to a plurality of rotatable shafts 16. The case 12 defines a<br>
bore 18, having a generally cylindrical surface 19, within which various operational<br>
components of the transmission 10 are contained, such as torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms 20 and planetary gearsets 22. An extension housing 24 is provided to seal<br>
the case 12 and define a bore 26, which is sufficiently configured such that an output<br>
shaft 28 of the transmission 10 can pass therethrough. Additionally, the extension<br><br>
housing 24 provides a measure of support to the output shaft 28 and may provide an<br>
attachment point for additional transmission components such as a transfer case and<br>
transmission mounts, not shown. The extension housing 24 includes a generally axially<br>
extending hub portion 30 having an outer surface 32 and defining the bore 26.<br>
Additionally, the extension housing 24 includes a generally radially outwardly extending<br>
flange portion 34 extending from the hub portion 30. A generally axially extending<br>
circumferential lip 36 is provided at the outer periphery of the flange portion 34 and is<br>
sufficiently configured to cooperate with the surface 19 to pilot the extension housing 24<br>
within the case 12. The flange portion 34 defines a plurality of bores 38, one of which is<br>
shown in Figure 1, each of which is substantially configured to receive a fastener 40<br>
therein. Preferably, the bores 38 will be radially spaced equiangularly about the flange<br>
portion 34. In the preferred embodiment, the fastener 40 will be a threaded fastener such<br>
as, for example, a hex head bolt, Allen head bolt, stud and nut, etc.<br>
	The bore 18 is sufficiently configured to pilot a fastening block member<br>
42 therein. The fastening block member 42 defines a generally cylindrical bore 44 and a<br>
plurality of threaded bores 46, one of which is shown in Figure 1. Each of the threaded<br>
bores 46 are axially aligned with a respective one of the plurality of bores 38 defined by<br>
the extension housing 24 such that the fastener 40 can threadingly engage a respective<br>
one of the plurality of threaded bores 46. In the preferred embodiment, the threaded<br>
bores 46 are blind, that is, the threaded bores do not extend through the fastening block<br>
member 42. The bore 44 is sufficiently configured to receive a section of the hub portion<br>
30.<br>
	An annular groove 48 is defined by the case 12 and opens radially<br>
inwardly toward the bore 18. The annular groove 48 is sufficiently configured to receive<br>
at least a portion of a retaining ring 50, such as a snap ring, therein. The retaining ring 50<br>
cooperates with the annular groove 48 to retain and limit the axial movement of the<br>
fastening block member 42 within the case 12. An annular seal 52 is disposed within an<br>
annular groove 54 defined by the fastening block member 42. The annular seal 52, such<br>
as an elastomeric o-ring, sealingly engages the surface 19 of the bore 18 thereby<br>
disallowing the passage of transmission fluid between the fastening block member 42 and<br>
the case 12. Similarly, an annular seal 56, such as an elastomeric o-ring, is disposed<br><br>
within an annular groove 58 defined by the hub portion 30 of the extension housing 24.<br>
The annular seal 56 sealingly engages the bore 44 thereby disallowing the passage of<br>
transmission fluid between the fastening block member 42 and the extension housing 24.<br>
	To assemble the extension housing 24 to the case 12, the fastening block<br>
member 42 is piloted within the bore 18 and sealingly engages the surface 19 of the case<br>
12. The retaining ring 50 is then inserted into the annular groove 48, thereby axially<br>
positioning and limiting the axial movement of the fastening block member 42 within the<br>
bore 18. The circumferential lip 36 of the extension housing 24 pilots within the bore 18.<br>
The hub portion 30 of the extension housing 24 sealingly engages the bore 44 of the<br>
fastening block member 42. The fasteners 40 threadingly engage the threaded bores 46<br>
such that as the fasteners 40 are tightened, the fastening block member 42 is urged<br>
against the retaining ring 50 and, in reaction, the extension housing 24 is drawn to the<br>
case 12. The annular seals 52 and 56 and the blind nature of the threaded bores 46<br>
cooperate to prevent transmission fluid from contacting the fasteners 40, thereby<br>
obviating the need to seal the fasteners 40 to prevent external leakage of transmission<br>
fluid.<br>
	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
