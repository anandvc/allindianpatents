The contents of all the aforementioned applications are expressly incorporated herein by this reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for separating and concentrating cells, e.g., regenerative cells, from a wide variety of tissues. The present invention particularly relates to automated systems and methods for separating and concentrating regenerative cells, e.g., stem cells and/or progenitor cells, from adipose tissue.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Regenerative medicine harnesses, in a clinically targeted manner, the ability of regenerative cells, e.g., stem cells and/or progenitor cells {i.e., the unspecialized master cells of the body), to renew themselves indefinitely and develop into mature specialized cells. Stem cells are found in embryos during early stages of development, in fetal tissue and in some adult organs and tissue (Pera et al., 2000). Embryonic stem cells (hereinafter referred to as "ESCs') are known to become many if not all of the cell and tissue types of the body. ESCs not only contain all the genetic information of the individual but also contain the nascent capacity to become any of the 200+ cells and tissues of the body. Thus, these cells have tremendous potential for regenerative medicine. For example, ESCs can be grown into specific tissues such as heart, lung or kidney which could then be used to repair damaged and<br><br>
diseased organs (Assady et al., 2001; Jacobson et al., 2001; Odorico et al., 2001). However, ESC derived tissues have clinical limitations. Since ESCs are necessarily derived from another individual, i.e., an embryo, there is a risk that the recipient's immune system will reject the new biological material. Although immunosuppressive drugs to prevent such rejection are available, such drugs are also known to block desirable immune responses such as those against bacterial infections and viruses. Moreover, the ethical debate over the source of ESCs, i.e., embryos, is well-chronicled and presents an additional and, perhaps, insurmountable obstacle for the foreseeable future.<br>
Adult stem cells (hereinafter interchangeably referred to as "ASCs") represent an alternative to the use of ESCs. ASCs reside quiedy in many non-embryonic tissues, presumably waiting to respond to trauma or other destructive disease processes so that they can heal the injured tissue (Arvidsson et al., 2002; Bonner-Weir and Sharma, 2002; Clarke and Frisen, 2001; Crosby and Strain, 2001; Jiang et al., 2002a). Notably, emerging scientific evidence indicates that each individual carries a pool of ASCs that may share with ESCs the ability to become many if not all types of cells and tissues (Young et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2002a; Jiang et al., 2002b; Schwartz et al., 2002). Thus, ASCs, like ESCs, have tremendous potential for clinical applications of regenerative medicine.<br>
ASC populations have been shown to be present in one or more of bone marrow, skin, muscle, liver and brain (Jiang et al., 2002b; Alison, 1998; Crosby and Strain, 2001). However,-the frequency of ASCs in these tissues i^ low. For example, mesenchymal stem cell frequency in bone marrow is estimated at between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 nucleated cells (D'Ippolito et al., 1999; Banfi et al., 2001; Falla et al., 1993). Similariy, extraction of ASCs from skin involves a complicated series of cell culture steps over several weeks (Toma et al., 2001) and clinical application of skeletal muscle-derived ASCs requires a two to three week culture phase (Hagege et al., 2003). Thus, any proposed clinical application of ASCs from such tissues requires increasing cell number, purity, and maturity by processes of cell purification and cell culture.<br>
Although cell culture steps may provide increased cell number, purity, and maturity, they do so at a cost. This cost can include one or more of the following technical difficulties: loss of cell function due to cell aging, loss of potentially useful non-stem cell populations, delays in potential application of cells to patients, increased monetary cost, and increased risk of contamination of cells with environmental microorganisms during culture. Recent studies examining the therapeutic effects of bone-marrow derived ASCs have used essentially whole marrow to circumvent the problems associated with cell culturing (Horwitz et al., 2001; Oriic<br><br>
et al., 2001; Stamm et al, 2003; Strauer et al., 2002). The clinical benefits, however, have been suboptimal, an outcome almost certainly related to the limited ASC dose and purity inherently available in bone marrow.<br><br>
from the havesting of adipose tissue phase through the processing of tissue phases (Katz et al., 2001 a) and/or. The existing methods further may lack volume capacity greater than 100ml of adipose tissue. The existing methods may yet further lack a partially or completely closed system from the harvesting of adipose tissue phase through the processing of tissue phases. Finally, the existing methods may lack disposability of components to attenuate concomitant risks of cross-contamination of material from one sample to another. In summary, the many prior art methods for harvesting ASCs from adipose tissue do not appear to overcome the technical difficulties associated with harvesting ASCs from skin, muscle, liver and brain described above.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for systems and methods that are capable of harvesting regenerative cell populations, e.g., ASCs, with increased yield, consistency and/or purity and of doing so rapidly and reliably with a diminished or non-existent need for post-extraction manipulation. Ideally, such a device, system or method would yield regenerative cells in a manner suitable for direct placement into a recipient.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to highly versatile system and methods capable of separating and concentrating a given tissue to produce regenerative cells, e.g., stem and progenitor cells, suitable for re-infusion into a subject.   In particular, the present invention provides an automated system for separating and concentrating regenerative cells from tissue.<br><br>
The types of tissue that can be processed by the systems and methods of the present invention, include but are not limited to, adipose tissue, blood, bone marrow, muscle, skin, liver, connective tissue, fascia and other soft and liquid tissues or tissue components.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an automated system for separating and concentrating regenerative cells from adipose tissue that are suitable for re-infusion into a subject. A system for separating and concentrating cells from adipose tissue in accordance with the disclosure herein generally includes one or more of a collection chamber, a processing chamber, a waste chamber, an output chamber and a sample chamber. The various chambers are coupled together via one or more conduits such that fluids containing biological material may pass from one chamber to another in a closed, sterile fluid/tissue pathway. In certain embodiments, the waste chamber, the output chamber and the sample chamber are optional.<br>
The system also includes a plurality of filters. The filters are effective to separate the stem cells and/or progenitor cells from, among other things, collagen, adipocytes, and tissue disaggregation agents, that may be present in the solution in connection with the processing of adipose tissue. In one embodiment, a filter assembly includes a hollow fiber filtration device. In another embodiment, a filter assembly includes a percolative filtration device, which may or may not be used with a sedimentation process. In a preferred embodiment, the filter assembly comprises a centrifugation device, which may or may not be used with an elutriation device and process. In yet another embodiment, the system comprises a combination of these filtering devices. The filtration functions of the present invention can be two-fold, with some filters removing things from the final concentration such as collagen, free lipid, free adipocytes and residual collagenase, and with other filters being used to concentrate the final product.<br>
In other embodiments, one or more components of the system are automated and include an internal processing device and associated software programs which control many of the processing functions. Components of the system may be disposable, such that portions of the system can be disposed of after a single use. Such a system also comprises a re-usable component which includes the processing device (computer and associated software programs) and other components such as motors, pumps, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, a method of treating a patient includes steps of: a) providing a tissue removal system; b) removing adipose tissue from a patient using the tissue removal system, the adipose tissue having a concentration of stem cells; c) processing at least a part of the adipose tissue to obtain a concentration of regenerative cells other than the<br><br>
concentration of regenerative cells of the adipose tissue before processing; and d) administering the regenerative cells to a patient without removing the regenerative cells from the tissue removal system before being administered to the patient, to thereby treat the patient<br>
Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the presen: invention provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one skilled in the art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present mvention relates to rapid and reliable systems and methods for separating and concentrating regenerative cells, e.g., stem cells and/or progenitor cells, from a wide variety of tissiues, including but not limited to, adipose, bone marrow, blood, skin, muscle, hver. connective tissue, fascia, brain and other nervous system tissues, blood vessels, and other soft or liquid tissues or tissue components or tissue mixtures (e.g., a mixture of tissues including skin, blood vessels, adipose, and connective tissue). In a preferred embodiment, the system separates and concentrates regenerative cells from adipose tissue. In another preferred embodiment, the system is automated such that the entire method from separation to concentration of the regenerative cells may be performed in a continuous sequence with minimal user intervention. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the regenerative cells obtained using the systems and methods of the present invention are suitable for placement into a recipient.<br>
Preferably, the entire procedure from tissue extraction through separating, concentrating and placement of the regenerative cells into the recipient would all be performed in the same facility, indeed, even within the same room of the patient undergoing the procedure. The regenerative cells may be used in a relatively short time period after extraction and concentration. For example, the regenerative cells may be ready for use in about one hour from the harvesting of tissue from a patient, and in certain situations, may be ready for use in about 10 to 40 minutes from the harvesting of the tissue. In a preferred embodiment, the regenerative cells may be ready to use in about 20 minutes from the harvesting of tissue. The entire length of the procedure from extraction through separating and concentrating may vary depending on a number of factors, including patient profile, type of tissue being harvested and the amount of regenerative cells required for a given therapeutic application. The cells may also be placed into the recipient in combination with other cells, tissue, tissue fragments, scaffolds or other stimulators of cell growth and/or differentiation in the context of a single operative procedure with the intention of deriving a therapeutic, structural, or cosmetic benefit to the recipient. It is understood that any further manipulation<br><br>
of the regenerative cells beyond the separating and concentrating phase of the system will require additional time commensurate with the manner of such manipulation.<br>
Patients suffering from wide variety of diseases and disorders may benefit from the regenerative cells of the present invention. For example, patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases and disorders, liver diseases and disorders, renal diseases and disorders, skeletal muscle disorders, lung injuries and disorders, diabetes, intestinal diseases and disorders, nervous system disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, stroke related diseases and disorders, diseases and disorders of the hematopoietic system, wounds, ulcers and other diseases and disorders of the skin, traumatic injury, bum, radiation or chemical or other toxin-induced injuries or disorders, and bone and cartilage related diseases and disorders can be treated using the regenerative cells obtained through the systems and methods of the present invention.<br>
In particular embodiments, diseases and disorders that are mediated by angiogenesis and arteriogenesis can be treated with the regenerative cells obtained using the systems and methods of the present invention. For example, acute myocardial infarctions, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic stroke, acute tubular necrosis, ischemic wounds, sepsis, ischemic bowel disease, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, vasculitidies, ischemic encephalopathy, erectile dysfunction, ischemic and/or traumatic spinal cord injuries, multiple organ system failures, ischemic gum disease and transplant related ischemia can be treated.<br>
Furthermore, diseases and disorders affecting more than one physiological system, e.g., traumatic injury involving both soft and hard tissues, the effects of aging, multi-organ disorders, etc., may also be treated with the regenerative cells obtained using the systems and methods of the present invention. The regenerative cells can also be used to promote tendon and cartilage repair and for a variety of clinical and non-clinical cosmetic and structural applications, including autologous fat transfer applications. Cosmetic applications include, for example, restructuring of facial folds and wrinkles, lip, breast and buttocks as well as other soft tissue defects.   The regenerative cells may also be used for tissue engineering applications known in the art.<br>
In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.<br>
As used herein, "regenerative cells" refers to any heterogeneous or homologous cells obtained using the systems and methods of the present invention which cause or contribute to<br><br>
complete or partial regeneration, restoration, or substitution of structure or function of an organ, tissue, or physiologic unit or system to thereby provide a therapeutic, structural or cosmetic benefit. Examples of regenerative cells include: ASCs, endothelial cells, endothelial precursor cells, endothelial progenitor cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, preadipocytes, differentiated or de-differentiated adipocytes, keratinocytes, unipotent and multipotent progenitor and precursor cells (and their progeny), and Iymphocytes<br>
One mechanism by which the regenerative cells may provide a therapeutic, structural or cosmetic benefit is by incorporating themselves or their progeny into newly generated, exisnng or repaired tissues or tissue components. For example, ASCs and/or their progeny may incorporate into newly generated bone, muscle, or other structural or functional tissue and thereby cause or contribute to a therapeutic, structural or cosmetic improvement. Srmilariy, endothelial cells or endothelial precursor or progenitor cells and their progeny may incorporate into existing, newly generated, repaired, or expanded blood vessels to thereby cause or contribute to a therapeutic, structural or cosmetic benefit.<br>
Another mechanism by which the regenerative cells may provide a therapeutic, structural or cosmetic benefit is by expressing and/or secreting molecules, e.g., growth factors, that promote creation, retention, restoration, and/or regeneration of structure or function of a given tissue or tissue component. For example, regenerative cells may express and'or secrete molecules which result in enhanced growth of tissues or cells that then participate directly or indirectly in improved structure or function. Regenerative cells may express and'or secrete growth factors, including, for example, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VTGF), Placental Growth factor (PIGF), bFGF, IGF-II, Eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-12 p4O/p70, IL-12 p70, E.-13, IL-6, IL-9, Leptin, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, PF-4, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TNF- a, Thrombopoetin, and their isoforms, which may perform one or more of the following functions: stimulate development of new blood vessels, i.e., promote angiogenesis; improve oxygen supply of pre-existent small blood vessels (collaterals) by expanding their blood carrying capacity; induce mobilization of regenerative cells from sites distant from the site of injury to thereby enhance the homing and migration of such cells to the site of injury; stimulate the growth and/or promote the survival of cells within a site of injury thereby promoting retention of function or structure; deliver molecules with anti-apoptotic properties thereby reducing the rate or likelihood of cell death and permanent loss of function; and interact with endogenous regenerative cells and/or other physiological mechanisms.<br><br>
The regenerative cells may be used in their 'native' form as present in or separated and concentrated from the tissue using the systems and methods of the present invention or they may be modified by stimulation or priming with growth factors or other biologic response modifiers, by gene transfer (transient or stable transfer), by further sub-fractionation of the resultant population on the basis or physical properties (for example size or density), differential adherence to a solid phase material, expression of cell surface or intracellular molecules, cell culture or other ex vivo or in vivo manipulation, modification, or fractionation as further described herein. The regenerative cells may also be used in combination with other cells or devices such as synthetic or biologic scaffolds, materials or devices that deliver factors, drugs, chemicals or other agents that modify or enhance the relevant characteristics of the cells as further described herein.<br>
As used herein, "regenerative cell composition" refers to the composition of cells typically present in a volume of liquid after a tissue, e.g., adipose tissue, is washed and at least partially disaggregated. For example, a regenerative cell composition of the invention comprises multiple different types of regenerative cells, including ASCs, endothelial cells, endothelial precursor cells, endothelial progenitor cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, preadipocytes, differentiated or de-differentiated adipocytes, keratinocytes, unipotent and multipotent progenitor and precursor cells (and their progeny), and lymphocytes. The regenerative cell composition may also contain one or more contaminants, such as collagen, which may be present in the tissue fragments, or residual collagenase or other enzyme or agent employed in or resulting from the tissue disaggregation process described herein.<br>
As used herein, "regenerative medicine" refers to any therapeutic, structural or cosmetic benefit that is derived from the placement; either directly or indirectly, of regenerative cells into a subject. Regenerative medicine encompasses all of the diseases and disorders described herein as well as those known in the art.<br>
As used herein, "stem cell" refers to a multipotent regenerative cell with the potential to differentiate into a variety of other cell types, which perform one or more specific functions and have the ability to self-renew. Some of the stem cells disclosed herein may be multipotent.<br>
As used herein, "progenitor cell" refers to a multipotent regenerative cell with the potential to differentiate into more than one cell type and has limited or no ability to self-renew. "Progenitor cell", as used herein, also refers to a unipotent cell with the potential to differentiate into only a single cell type, which performs one or more specific functions and<br><br><br>
As used herein, the tenn "adipose tissue" refers to fat including the connective tissue that stores fat Adipose tissue contains multiple regenerative cell types, including ASCs and endothelial progenitor and precursor cells.<br>
As used herein, the term "unit of adipose tissue" refers to a discrete or measurable amount of adipose tissue. A unit of adipose tissue may be measured by determining the weight and or volume of the unit. Based on the data identified above, a unit of processed lipoaspirate, as removed from a patient, has a cellular component in which at least 0.1% of the cellular component is stem cells; that is, it has a stem cell frequency, determined as described above, of at least 0.1%. In reference to the disclosure herein, a unit of adipose tissue may refer to the entire amount of adipose tissue removed from a patient, or an amount that is less than the entire amount of adipose tissue removed from a patient. Thus, a unit of adipose tissue may be combined with another unit of adipose tissue to form a unit of adipose tissue that has a weight or volume that is the sum of the individual units.<br>
As used herein, the term "portion" refers to an amount of a material that is less than a<br><br>
whole. A minor portion refers to an amount that is less than 50%, and a major portion refers to an amount greater than 50%. Thus, a unit of adipose tissue that is less than the entire amount of adipose tissue removed from a patient is a portion of the removed adipose tissue.<br>
As used herein, the term "processed lipoaspirate" refers to adipose tissue that has been processed to separate the active cellular component (e.g., the component containing regenerative) from the mature adipocytes and connective tissue. This fraction is referred to herein as "adipose-derived cells" or "ADC." Typically, ADC refers to the pellet of regenerative cells obtained by washing and separating and concentrating the cells from the adipose tissue. The pellet is typically obtained by centrifuging a suspension of cells so that the cells aggregate at the bottom of a centrifuge chamber or cell concentrator.<br>
As used herein, the terms "administering," "introducing," "delivering," "placement" and "transplanting" are used interchangeably herein and refer to the placement of the regenerative cells of the invention into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial localization of the regenerative cells at a desired site. The regenerative cells can be administered by any appropriate route which results in delivery to a desired location in the subject where at least a portion of the cells or components of the cells remain viable. The period of viability of the cells after administration to a subject can be as short as a few hours, e.g., twenty-four hours, to a few days, to as long as several years.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of a disease or disorder<br>
As used herein, "therapeutically effective dose of regenerative cells" refers to an amount of regenerative cells that are sufficient to bring about a beneficial or desired clinical effect. Said dose could be administered in one or more administrations. However, the precise determination of what would be considered an effective dose may be based on factors individual to each patient, including, but not limited to, the patient's age, size, type or extent of disease, stage of the disease, route of administration of the regenerative cells, the type or extent of supplemental therapy used, ongoing disease process and type of treatment desired (e.g., aggressive vs. conventional treatment).<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" includes warm-blooded animals, preferably mammals, including humans. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a primate. In an even more preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.<br>
As previously set forth herein, regenerative cells, e.g., stem and progenitor cells, can be harvested from a wide variety of tissues. The system of the present invention may be used<br><br><br>
which the tissue is being collected. For example, the regenerative cell percentage of 100 ml of adipose tissue extracted from a lean individual is greater than that extracted from an obese donor (Table 1). This likely reflects a dilutive effect of the increased fat content in the obese individual. Therefore, it may be desirable, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, to obtain larger amounts of tissue from overweight donors compared to the amounts that would be withdrawn from leaner patients. This observation also indicates that the utility of this invention is not limited to individuals with large amounts of adipose tissue.<br><br>
After the adipose tissue is processed, the resulting regenerative cells are substantially free from mature adipocytes and connective tissue. Accordingly, the system of the present invention generates a heterogeneous plurality of adipose derived regenerative cells which may be used for research and/or therapeutic purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the cells are suitable for placement or re-infusion within the body of a recipient. In other embodiments, the cells may be used for research, e.g., the cells can be used to establish stem<br><br>
or progenitor cell lines which can survive for extended periods of time and be used for further study.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same or similar reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. It should be noted that the drawings are in simplified form and are not to precise scale. In reference to the disclosure herein, for purposes of convenience and clarity only, directional terms, such as, top, bottom, left, right, up, down, over, above, below, beneath, rear, front, distal, and proximal are used with respect to the accompanying drawings. Such directional terms should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
Although the disclosure herein refers to certain illustrated embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are presented by way of example and not by way of limitation. The intent of the following detailed description, although discussing exemplary embodiments, is to be construed to cover all modifications, alternatives, and equivalents of the embodiments as may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The present invention may be utilized in conjunction with various medical procedures that are conventionally used in the art.<br>
Referring now to the Figures, a system 10 of the present invention is generally comprised of one or more of a tissue collection chamber 20, a processing chamber 30, a waste chamber 40, an output chamber 50 and a sample chamber 60. The various chambers are coupled together via one or more conduits 12 such that fluids containing biological material may pass from one chamber to another while maintaining a closed, sterile fluid/tissue pathway. The conduits may comprise rigid or flexible bodies referred to interchangeably herein as lumens and tubing, respectively. In certain embodiments, the conduits are in the form of flexible tubing, such as polyethylene tubing conventionally used in clinical settings, silicone or any other material known in the art. The conduits 12 can vary in size depending on whether passage of fluid or tissue is desired. The conduits 12 may also vary in size depending on the amount of tissue or fluid that is cycled through the system. For example, for the passage of fluid, the conduits may have a diameter ranging from about 0.060 to about 0.750 inches and for the passage of tissue, the conduits may have a diameter ranging from 03\2 to 0.750 inches.  Generally, the size of the conduits is selected to balance the<br><br><br>
fluid passageways from one chamber of the system to another. Towards this end, the conduits and ports may be coupled to, for example, a suction device (not shown) which may be manually or automatically operated. The suction device may be, e.g., a syringe or an electric pump. The suction device should be capable of providing sufficient negative pressure to aspirate tissue from a patient. Generally, any suitable suction device known to one of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., a surgeon, may be used.<br>
The conduits 12 may further comprise one or more clamps (not shown) to control the flow of material among various components of the system. The clamps are useftil for matntaining the sterility of the system by effectively sealing different regions of the system. Alternatively, the conduits 12 may comprise one or more valves 14 that control the flow of material through the system. The valves 14 are identified as open circles in the Figures. In preferred embodiments, the valves maybe electromechanical pinch valves. In another embodiment, the valves may be pneumatic valves. In yet other embodiments, the valves may be hydraulic valves or mechanical valves. Such valves are preferably activated by a control system which may be coupled to levers. The levers may be manually manipulated such that the levers are activated. In automated embodiments, the control system may be coupled to the levers as well as to a processing device which may activate the valves at pre-determined activation conditions. In certain automated embodiments, activation of the valves may be partially automated and partially subject to the user's preference such that the process may be optimized. In yet other embodiments, certain valves may be activated manually and others<br><br>
automatically through the processing device. The valves 14 may also be used in conjunction with one or more pumps, e.g., peristaltic pumps 34 or positive displacement pumps (not shown). The conduits 12 and/or the valves 14 may also be comprised of sensors 29, e.g., optical sensors, ultrasonic sensors, pressure sensors or other forms of monitors known in the art that are capable of distinguishing among the various fluid components and fluid levels that flow through the system. In a preferred embodiment, the sensors 29 may be optical sensors.<br>
The system may also include a plurality of filters 36. In certain embodiments, the filters may be within a chamber of the system 28. Different chambers within the system may be comprised of different filters. The filters are effective to separate the regenerative cells, e.g., stem cells and/or progenitor cells, from undesirable cells and disaggregation agents that may be used in accordance with the system. In one embodiment, a filter assembly 36 includes a hollow fiber filtration device. In another embodiment, a filter assembly 36 includes a percolative filtration device, which may or may not be used with a sedimentation process. In a further embodiment, the filter assembly 36 comprises a centrifiugation device, which may or may not be used with an elutriation device and process. In yet another embodiment, the system comprises a combination of these filtering devices. The filtration functions of the present invention can be two-fold, with some filters removing things firom the final concentration such as collagen, free lipid, free adipocytes and residual collagenase, and with other filters being used to concentrate the final product. The filters of the system may be comprised of a plurality of pores ranging in diameters and/or length from 20 to 800. In a preferred embodiment, the collection chamber 20 has a prefixed filter 28 with a plurality of pores ranging from 80 to 400 In another preferred embodiment, the collection chamber 20 has a prefixed filter 28 with a plurality of 265 pores. In other embodiments, the filters may be detachable and/or disposable.<br>
The system may also be comprised of one or more temperature control devices (not shown) that are positioned to adjust the temperature of the material contained within one or more chambers of the system. The temperature control device may be a heater, a cooler or both, i.e., it may be able to switch between a heater and a cooler. The temperature device may adjust the temperature of any of the material passing through the system, including the tissue, the disaggregation agents, the resuspension agents, the rinsing agents, the washing agents or the additives. For example, heating of adipose tissue facilitates disaggregation whereas the cooling of the regenerative cell output is desirable to maintain viability. Also, if pre-warmed reagents are needed for optimal tissue processing, the role of the temperature<br><br><br>
this embodiment, the entire system is attached to the patient. The tissue may be introduced into the collection chamber 20 through an inlet port 21 via a conduit such as 12a which are part of a closed sterile pathway. The collection chamber 20 may be comprised of a plurality of flexible or rigid canisters or cylinders or combinations thereof. For example, the collection chamber 2C may be comprised of one or more rigid canisters of varying sizes. The collection chamber 20 may also be comprised of one or more flexible bags. In such systems, the bag is preferably provided with a support, such as in internal or external frame, that helps reduce the likelihood that the bag will collapse upon the application of suction to the bag. The collection chamber 20 is sized to hold the requisite amount of saline to appropriately wash and disaggregate the tissue prior to the wash and concentrate stage of the process performed in the processing chamber 30. Preferably, the volume of tissue or fluid present in the collection chamber 20 is easily ascertainable to the naked eye. For example, to obtain regenerative cells from adipose tissue, a suitable collection chamber has the capacity to hold 800 ml of lipoaspirate and 1200 ml of saline. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the collection chamber 20 has a capacity of at least 2 liters. In another embodiment, to separate and concentrate red blood cells from blood, the collection chamber 20 has a capacity of at least 1.5 liters. Generally, the size of the collection chamber 20 will vary depending on the type and amount of tissue collected from the patient. The collection chamber 20 may be sized to hold as little as about 5 ml to up to about 2 liters of tissue. For smaller tissue volumes, e.g., 5<br><br>
mis to 100 mis, the tissue may be gathered in a syringe prior to transfer to the collection chamber 20.<br>
The collection chamber 20 may be constructed using any suitable biocompatible material that can be sterilized. In a preferred embodiment, the collection chamber 20 is constructed of disposable material that meets biocompatibility requirements for intravascular contact as described in the ISO 10993 standard. For example, polycarbonate acrylic or ABS may be used. The fluid path of the collection chamber 20 is preferably pyrogen free, i.e., suitable for blood use without danger of disease transmittal. In one embodiment, the collection chamber 20 is constructed of a material that allows the user to visually determine the approximate volume of tissue present in the chamber. In other embodiments, the volume of tissue and/or fluid in the collection chamber 20 is determined by automated sensors 29. The collection chamber 20 is preferably designed such that in an automated embodiment, the system can determine the volume of tissue and/or fluid within the chamber with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In a preferred embodiment, the system senses the volume within the collection chamber with an accuracy of plus or minus fifteen percent.<br>
In a particular embodiment provided by way of example only, the collection chamber 20 is in the form of a rigid chamber, for example, a chamber constructed of a medical grade polycarbonate containing a roughly conical prefixed filter 28 of medical grade polyester with a mesh size of 265 \xm (see Figure 5). The rigid tissue collection container may have a size of approximately eight inches high and approximately five inches in diameter; the wall thickness may be about 0.125 inches. The interior of the cylinder may be accessed through, for example, one or more ports for suction tubing, one or more ports with tubing for connection through sterile docking technology, and/or one or more ports for needle puncture access through a rubber septum. The prefixed filter 28 in the interior of the collection chamber 20 is preferably structured to retain adipose tissue and to pass non-adipose tissue as, for example, the tissues are removed from the patient. More specifically, the filter 28 may allow passage of free lipid, blood, and saline, while retaining fragments of adipose tissue during, or in another embodiment after, the initial harvesting of the adipose tissue. In that regard, the filter 28 includes a plurality of pores, of either the same or different sizes, but ranging in size from about 20 to 5 mm. In a preferred embodiment, the filter 28 includes a plurality of 400 pores. In a preferred embodiment, the filter 28 is a medical grade polyester mesh of around 200thickness with a pore size of around 265 and around 47% open area. This material holds the tissue during rinsing but allows cells to pass out through the mesh following tissue disaggregation. Thus, when the tissues are aspirated from<br><br>
the patient, non-adipose tissue may be separated from adipose tissue. The same functionality could be  different materials, mesh size, and the number and type of ports. For example, mesh pore sizes smaller than 100  or as large as several thousand microns would achieve the same purpose of allowing passage of saline and blood cells while retaining adipose tissue aggregates and fragments. Similarly, the same purpose could be achieved by use of an alternative rigid plastic material, or by many other modifications that would be known to those skilled in the art<br>
Toe system 10 may also be comprised of one or more solution sources 22. The solution source may comprise a washing solution source 23, and a tissue disaggregation agent source 24, such as collagenase. The collection chamber 20 is comprised of closed fluid hat allows for the washing and disaggregating solutions or agents to be added to the tiss in an aseptic manner.<br>
 for the washing solution 23 and the disaggregation agents 24 may be any suitable container that can hold their contents in a sterile manner, e.g., a collapsible bag, such as an bag used in clinical settings. These containers may have conduits 12, such as conduit 12e, coupled to the collection chamber 20 so that the washing solution and the disaggregation agent may be delivered to the interior of the collection chamber 20. The washing solution and the disaggregation agent may be delivered to the interior of the collection chamber 20 through any art-recognized manner, including simple gravity pressure applied to the outside of the containers for the saline 23 and/or the disaggregation agents 24 or by placement of a positive displacement pump on the conduits, e.g., conduit 12d in Figure 4. ]n automated embodiments, the processing device of the system calculates various parameters, e.g., the volume of saline and time or number of cycles required for washing as well as the concentration or amount of disaggregation agent and the time required for disaggregation based on information initially entered by the user (e.g., volume of tissue being processed). Alternatively, the amounts, times etc. can be manually manipulated by the user.<br>
The tissue and/or fluid within the collection chamber should be maintained at a temperature ranging from 30 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the suspension inside the collection chamber is maintained at 37 degrees Celsius. In certain embodiments, if the surgical procedure or therapeutic application needs to be delayed, the selected tissue may be stored in the collection chamber for later use. The tissue may be stored at or about room temperature or at about 4 degrees Celsius for up to 96 hours.<br><br>
The washing solution may be any solution known to one of skill in the art, including saline or any other buffered or unbuffered electrolyte solution.   The types of tissue being processed will dictate the types or combinations of washing solutions used. Typically, the washing solution, such as saline, enters the collection chamber 20 after the adipose tissue has been removed from the patient and placed in the collection chamber. However, the washing solution may be delivered to the collection chamber 20 before the adipose tissue is extracted, or may be delivered to the collection chamber 20 concurrently with the adipose tissue. In the collection chamber 20, the washing solution and the extracted adipose tissue may be mixed by any means including the methods described below.<br>
For example, the tissue may be washed by agitation (which maximizes cell viability and minimizes the amount of free lipid released). In one embodiment, the tissue is agitated by rotating the entire collection chamber 20 through an arc of varying degrees (e.g., through an arc of about 45 degrees to about 90 degrees) at varying speeds, e.g., about 30 revolutions per minute. In other embodiments, the tissue is agitated by rotating the entire collection chamber 20, wherein the collection chamber 20 is comprised of one or more paddles or protrusions rigidly attached to an inside surface of the collection chamber, through an arc of varying degrees (e.g., through an arc of about 45 degrees to about 90 degrees) at varying speeds, e.g., about 30 revolutions per minute. The rotation of the collection chamber 20 described above may be accomplished by a drive mechanism attached to or in proximity with the collection chamber 20. The drive mechanism may be a simple belt or gear or other drive mechanism known in the art. The speed of the rotation may be, for example, 30 revolutions per minute.   Generally, higher speeds have been found to generate larger volumes of free lipids and may not be optimal.<br>
In other embodiments, the tissue is agitated by placing a rotatable shaft 25 inside the collection chamber 20, wherein the rotatable shaft is comprised of one or more paddles 25a or protrusions rigidly attached to the rotatable shaft 25 which pass through the mixture as the shaft is being rotated. In certain embodiments, the rotatable shaft 25 with rigidly attached 25a paddles may be rested on the bottom of the collection chamber 20. This may be accomplished, for example, by placing the paddle-like device into a spinning magnetic field (e.g., magnetic stirrer). Alternatively, agitating of the tissue may be accomplished using a simple agitator known in the art, i.e. a device implementing shaking up and down without rotation.  The tissue may also be washed using any other art-recognized means including rocking, stirring, inversion, etc.<br><br>
After 3 desired amount of wash cycles, a tissue disaggregation agent may be deiiverea to the coIlec: chamber 20 to separate the regenerative cells from the remaining adipose tissue components. The disaggregation agent may be any disaggregation agent known to one of skill in the art. Disaggregation agents that may be used include neutral proteases, collagenase,lipase, hyaluronidase, deoxyribonuclease, members of the Blendzyme mixture family, e.g., Liberase HI, pepsin, ultrasonic or other physical energy, lasers, , other mechanical devices and/or combinations thereof. A preferred :ion agent of the invention is collagenase. The disaggregation agents maybe added other solutions. For example, saline, such as saline delivered from a saline source 23 as  above, may be added to the adipose tissue along with or immediately  by addition of collagenase. In one embodiment, the washed adipose tissue is mixed with 2 collagenase-containing enzyme solution at or around 37° C for about 20-60 minutes. In other embodiments, a higher concentration of collagenase or similar agent may be added to decrease the digestion time. The washed adipose tissue and the tissue disaggregation agent may then be agitated in manners similar to the agitation methods described above, until the washed adipose tissue is disaggregated. For example, the washed adipose tissue and the tissue disaggregation agent may be agitated by rotating the entire collection chamber through an arc of approximately 90 degrees, by having a shaft which contains one or more paddles which pass through the solution as the shaft is being rotated, and/or by rotating the entire collection chamber which contains paddles or protrusions on the inside surface of the collection chamber.<br>
Depending on the purpose for which the adipose derived cells will be used, the adipose tissue may either be partially disaggregated, or completely disaggregated. For example, in embodiments in which the adipose derived cells are to be combined with a unit of adipose tissue, it may be desirable to partially disaggregate the harvested adipose tissue, to remove a portion of the partially disaggregated adipose tissue, and then continue disaggregating the remaining portion of adipose tissue remaining in the collection chamber. Alternatively, a portion of washed adipose tissue may be removed and set aside in a sample container prior to any digestion. In another embodiment, harvested adipose tissue is partially disaggregated to concentrate cells before being reintroduced back into the patient. In one embodiment, the adipose tissue is mixed with a tissue disaggregation agent for a period of rime generally less than about 20 minutes. A portion of the partially disaggregated tissue may then be removed from the collection chamber, and the remaining partially disaggregated tissue may be further disaggregated by mixing the adipose tissue with a tissue disaggregation<br><br>
agent for another 40 minutes. When the adipose derived cells are to be used as an essentially pure population of regenerative cells, the adipose tissue may be fully disaggregated.<br>
After digestion, the tissue and disaggregation agent solution is allowed to settle for a period of time sufficient to allow the buoyant and non-buoyant components of the solution to differentiate within the collection chamber. Typically, the time ranges from about 15 seconds to several minutes but other times may be implemented in modified embodiments. The buoyant layer is comprised of the regenerative cells that require further washing and concentrating. The non-buoyant layer comprises blood, collagen, lipids and other non-regenerative cell components of the tissue. The non-buoyant layer must be removed to the waste chamber.<br>
Accordingly, the collection chamber 20 is preferably comprised of an outlet port 22 at the lowest point of the chamber such that blood and other non-buoyant components of the tissue may be drained to one or more waste containers 40 via one or more conduits 12. The collection chamber 20 is generally in (or may be placed in) an upright position such that the outlet ports 22 are located at the bottom of the collection chamber. The draining may be passive or active. For example, the non-buoyant components described above could be drained using gravity, by applying positive or negative pressure, by use of pumps 34 or by use of vents 32.    In automated embodiments, the processing device can signal certain valves and/or pumps to drain the non-buoyant layer from the collection chamber 20. The automated embodiments may also be comprised of sensors 29 which can detect when the interface between the buoyant and non-buoyant liquids has been reached. The automated embodiments may also be comprised of a sensor 29, e.g., an optical sensor, which may be capable of detecting a change in the light refraction of the effluent which is flowing in the conduit leading out of the collection chamber. The appropriate change in the light refraction may signal the presence of the buoyant layer in the outgoing conduits which indicates that the non-buoyant layer has been drained. The sensor 29 can then signal the processing device to proceed with the next step.<br>
In certain embodiments however, the tissue may be processed to retrieve the non-regenerative cell component of the tissue. For example, in certain therapeutic or research applications, collagen, proteins, matrix or stromal components, lipids, adipocytes or other components of the tissue may be desired. In such embodiments, it is the buoyant layer comprising the regenerative cells that must be removed as described above to the waste chamber. The non-buoyant layer is then retained in the system for further processing as needed.<br><br>
Once the non-buoyant layer is removed, the buoyant layer comprising the regenerative cells may be washed one or more times to remove residual contaminants. Accordingly the collection chamber 20 typically includes one or more ports 21 for permitting the washing solution to be delivered to the interior of the chamber, and one or more ports 22 for permittig  aste and other materials to be directed out from the collection chamber 20. For example, the collection chamber may include one or more sealed entry ports as described herein. The collection chamber 20 may also include one or more caps (not shown), such as a top cap and a bottom cap to further ensure that the system remains sterile while washing solution is delivered into the collection chamber and/or waste is transported out. The ports 21 may be on the caps of the collection chamber or on a sidewall of the collection chamber.<br>
The process of w'ashing with fresh wash solution may be repeated until the residual content of buoyant contaminants in the solution reaches a pre-determined level. In other words, the remaining material in the collection chamber 20, which comprises the buoyant material of the mixture described above, including adipose tissue fragments, may be washed one or more additional times until the amount of undesired material is reduced to a desired pre-determined level. One method of determining the end point of the washing is to measure the amount of red blood cells in the tissue solution. This can be accomplished by measuring the light absorbed on the 540 nm wavelength. In a preferred embodiment, a range between about 0.546 and about 0.842 is deemed acceptable.<br>
During the washing and/or disaggregation, one or more additives may be added to the various containers as needed to enhance the results. Some examples of additives include agents that optimize washing and disaggregation, additives that enhance the viability of the active cell population during processing, anti-microbial agents (e.g., antibiotics), additives that K'se adipocytes and/or red blood cells, or additives that enrich for cell populations of interest (by differential adherence to solid phase moieties or to otherwise promote the substantial reduction or enrichment of cell populations). Other possible additives include those that promote recovery and viability of regenerative cells (for example, caspase inhibitors) or which reduce the likelihood of adverse reaction on infusion or emplacement (for example, inhibitors of re-aggregation of cells or connective tissue).<br>
After a sufficient settling time has elapsed, the non-buoyant fraction of the resulting mixture of washed adipose tissue fragments and tissue disaggregation agents will contain regenerative cells, e.g., stem cells and other adipose derived progenitor cells. As discussed herein, the non-buoyant fraction containing the regenerative cells will be transferred to the<br><br>
processing chamber 30 wherein the regenerative cells of interest, such as the adipose derived stem cells, will be separated from other cells and materials present in the non-buoyant fraction of the mixture. This non-buoyant fraction is referred to herein as the regenerative cell composition and comprises multiple different types of cells, including stem cells, progenitor cells, endothelial precursor cells, adipocytes and other regenerative cells described herein. The regenerative cell composition may also contain one or more contaminants, such as collagen and other connective tissue proteins and fragments thereof, which were present in the adipose tissue fragments, or residual collagenase from the tissue disaggregation process.<br>
The processing chamber 30 of the invention is preferably positioned within the system such that the regenerative cell composition moves from the collection chamber 20 to the processing chamber 30 by way of tubing 12, valves 14 and pump 34 in a sterile manner. The processing chamber is sized to accommodate tissue/fluid mixtures ranging from lOmL to 1.2L. In a preferred embodiment, the processing chamber is sized to accommodate 800 mLs. In certain embodiments, the entire regenerative cell composition from the collection chamber 20 is directed to the processing chamber 30. However, in other embodiments, a portion of the regenerative cell composition is directed to the processing chamber 30, and another portion is directed to a different region of the system, e.g., the sample chamber 60, to be recombined with cells processed in the processing chamber 30 at a later time.<br>
The processing chamber 30 may be constructed using any suitable biocompatible material that can be sterilized. In a preferred embodiment, the processing chamber 30 is constructed of disposable material that meets biocompatibility requirements for intravascular contact, as described in the ISO 10993 standard. For example, polycarbonate, acrylic, ABS, ethylene vinyl acetate or styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBC) may be used. In another embodiment, the fluid path of the disposable processing chamber is pyrogen free.     The processing chamber may be in the form of a plastic bag, such as those conventionally used in processing blood in blood banks; or in other embodiments, it may be structurally rigid (Figure 6). In one embodiment, the processing chamber 30 may be similar to the processing chamber disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Application No. 10/316,127, filed December 7, 2001 and U.S. Application No. 10/325,728, filed December 20, 2002, the contents of which in their entirety are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The processing chamber 30 may be constructed in any manner suitable for separating and concentrating cells, including filtration and centrifugation and/or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the regenerative cell composition from the collection chamber 20 is introduced into the processing chamber 30 where the composition can be filtered to separate<br><br><br>
collagen and the tissue disaggregation agent from the composition. The plurality of filters are typically serially arranged; however, at least a portion of the filters may be arranged in parallel, as well. A serial arrangement of the filters of the filter assembly 36 is shown in Figure 2. A parallel arrangement of the filters of the filter assembly 36 is shown in Figure 3. In one embodiment, the filter assembly 36 comprises a first filter, a second filter, and a third filter. The first filter is configured to remove collagen particles present in the regenerative cell composition. These collagen particles are typically approximately 0.1 microns in diameter and can be up to 20 microns long. The collagen particles may be of varying sizes depending on the digestion. They also may be fibrils, meaning they have twists<br><br>
and turns. Any of the filters described herein may be made from polyethersulfone, polyester, PTFE, polypropylene, PVDF, or possibly cellulose. There are two possibilities for filtering the collagen. One is to try to remove the larger particles first, letting the cells go through, which would require for example a filter probably in the 10 micron range. The second method is to use a smaller size filter, such as 4.5 micron, with the intent that the collagen would be well digested, so as to trap the cells, and let the collagen pass through. This would require a means to float the cells back off the filter. There may also be a possibility of implementing a filter which would attract and hold the collagen fibers.<br>
The second filter is configured to remove free immature adipocytes which are not buoyant in the regenerative cell composition. In one embodiment the second filter can be constructed of polyester and have a pore size between about 30 and about 50 microns with a preferred pore size being about 40 microns. Although referred to as a second filter, placement of such a device may be in a first, rather than second, position to facilitate an initial removal of larger cells and particles. The third filter is configured to remove the unused or residual collagenase or other tissue disaggregation agent present in the composition. In a preferred implementation, the collagenase may degenerate over time. In one embodiment, the third filter comprises a plurality of pores having a diameter, or length less than 1 In certain embodiments, the pores may have diameters that are smaller than 1 . In other embodiments, the pores have diameters between 10 kD and 5 microns. In certain embodiments, the third filter may be configured to concentrate the regenerative cell population into a small volume of saline or other washing solution, as discussed herein. As presently preferred, only the final filter is the hollow fiber unit. It is not necessary for any of the filters to be of the hollow fiber type. The hollow fiber unit is used for the final filter in a preferred implementation because it is the most efficient in removing the collagenase with the smallest detrimental effect to the regenerative cells. In an embodiment wherein the device is a collection of off the shelf items, the three filters are in separate housings. It is feasible to have the first and second filters combined into one housing if a hollow fiber unit is used for the third filter. If the final filter is not a hollow fiber set-up then all three filters can be contained in one housing.<br>
The filters of the filter assembly 36 may be located in the processing chamber 30 or may be provided as components separate from the processing chamber 30. In addition, the filters of the filter assembly 36 may be provided in multiple processing chambers or in an inline fashion. In certain embodiments, the conduits or tubing may act as a processing chamber or chambers. The processing chamber can be reduced in size such that it becomes<br><br><br>
the undigested tissue disaggregation agent, may be directed through the third filter, such as a hollow fiber filtration device, as discussed herein, to remove or reduce the undigested tissue disaggregation agent from the regenerative cell composition.<br>
The thrice-filtered regenerative cell composition (i.e., the composition remaining after being passed through the first, second, and third filters) may then be directed to multiple outlets, which may include a portion of the processing chamber 30 comprising multiple outlets. These outlets can serve to maintain the necessary pressure, as well as to provide connections via conduits to other containers which may include the collection chamber 20, the output chamber 50, and/or the waste container 40.<br>
In one embodiment, a filter of the filter assembly 36 comprises a hollow-fiber filtration member. Or, in other words, the filter comprises a collection of hollow tubes fonned with the filter media. Examples of filter media which can be used with the disclosed system 10 include polysulfone, polyethersulfone or a mixed ester material, and the like. These hollow fibers or hollow tubes of filter media may be contained in a cylindrical cartridge of the filter assembly 36. The individual tubes or fibers of filter media typically have an inside diameter which ranges fi-om about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm with a preferred value being about 0.5 mm. The diameter and length of a suitable cylindrical cartridge will determine the number of individual tubes of filter media which can be placed inside the cartridge. One example of a suitable hollow fiber filter cartridge is the FiberFlo  Tangential Flow Filter, catalog #M-C-050-K(Minntech, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Pore sizes of the<br><br>
filter media can range between about 10 kiloDaltons and about 5 microns with a preferred pore size being about 0.5 microns.<br>
In the hollow-fiber filter, each hollow tube has a body with a first end, a second end, and a lumen located in the body and extending between the first end and second end. The body of each hollow tube includes a plurality of pores. The pores are generally oriented in the body so that a regenerative cell composition is filtered by flowing through the lumen of the body, and the products to be filtered tangentially pass through the pores, as shown in Figure 12A. In other words, the smaller particles in the liquid pass tangentially through the pores relative the flow of fluid through the lumen of the body. The composition with the regenerative cells passes through the lumen of each hollow tube when the composition is being filtered. Preferably, the flow of the composition is tangential to the pores of the body of each hollow tube.<br>
By using a tangential flow of fluid, the efficiency of filtration of the stem cells may be enhanced relative to other filtration techniques. For example, in accordance with some filtration techniques, the pores of the filter media are placed in such a manner that the filter is orientated perpendicular to the flow of the fluid so that the Filter media blocks the path of the fluid being filtered, as illustrated in Figure 12B. In this type of filtration, the particles which are being filtered out of the regenerative cell composition, e.g., the stem cells, tend to build up on one side of the filter and block the flow of the fluid through the pores. This blockage can reduce the efficiency of the filter. In addition, the cells are constantly compressed by the pressure of the fluid flow as well as the weight of the cells accumulating on the upstream side of the filter. This can lead to increased lysis of stem cells. Thus, in such filtration techniques wherein the flow of fluid is parallel to the orientation of the pores in the filter, both large cells and small particles can be undesirably directed against the filter media as the fluid is passed through the pores. Consequently, larger products in the liquid such as cells may block the pores, thereby decreasing the filtering effect and increasing an occurrence of cell rupture or injury.<br>
In contrast, in the hollow fiber configuration of the present system 10, the fluid which is being filtered flows inside the lumen of the hollow tube. The portion of the fluid which has the ability to pass through the pores of the body of the filter does so with the aid of the positive pressure of the fluid on the inside of the body as well as a negative pressure which is applied on the outside of the body. In this embodiment, the cells typically are not subjected to the pressure of the fluid flow or the weight of other cells, and therefore, the shear forces on the stem cells are reduced  Thus, the efficiency and effectiveness of the filtration can be<br><br><br><br>
assembly 36 so that liquid contained in the processing chamber 30 may flow to one or more of these optional components before flowing through the filter assembly 36. For example, liquid may flow through the pump 34 before it is passed to the filter assembly 36. Or, liquid may pass through the pressure sensor 39 before passing through the filter assembly to obtain a pre-filter liquid pressure in the system. In certain situations, one or more of these components may also be provided as an element of the processing chamber 30, such as the vent 32 as illustrated in Figure. 6. In the illustrated embodiment, the pressure sensor 39 is in line to determine the pressure of the regenerative cell composition which is generated by the pump 34 as it enters the filtering chamber of the filter assembly 36. This construction can facilitate monitoring of the trans-membrane pressure across the filter membrane. Additional saline or other buffer and washing solution can be added to the regenerative cell composition to assist in the removal of unwanted proteins as the composition is being filtered through the filter assembly 36. This repeated washing can be performed multiple times to enhance the purity of the regenerative cells. In certain embodiments, the saline can be added at any step as deemed necessary to enhance filtration.<br>
In one specific embodiment, which is provided by way of example and not limitation, the unwanted proteins and saline or other washing solution is removed in the following manner. The composition with the regenerative cells, as well as collagen and connective tissue particles or fragments, adipocytes, and collagenase, is cycled through a series of filters until a minimum volume is reached. The minimum volume is a function of the total hold up volume of the system and some predetermined constant. The hold up volume is the volume of liquid which is contained in the tubing and conduits if all of the processing chambers are empty. In one embodiment, the minimum volume is 15 ml. When the minimum volume is reached, a predetermined volume of washing solution is introduced into the system to be mixed with the regenerative cell composition. This mixture of washing solution and the regenerative cell composition is then cycled through the filters until the minimum volume is reached again. This cycle can be repeated multiple times to enhance the purity of the regenerative cells, or in other words, to increase the ratio of regenerative cells in the composition to the other materials in the composition. See Figures 10 and 11.<br>
After it has been determined that the regenerative cell composition has been cleansed of unwanted proteins and concentrated sufficiently (in exemplary embodiments, minimum concentrations within a range of about 1 x 102 to about 1 x 102 cells/ml can be used and, in a preferred embodiment the minimum concentration can be about 1x102 cells/ml), an output chamber 50, such as an output bag, may be connected to an outlet port of the processing<br><br><br>
may be coupled to the collection chamber 20 via a conduit, such as conduit 12b, to cause a decrease in pressure within the collection chamber 20. Vacuum pump 26 may also be coupled to the processing chamber 30 by way of a conduit, such as conduit 12g. Regarding the operation of vacuum pump 26 in connection with pump 34, two separate vacuum pumps or sources may be implemented, or a single one may be implemented by using valves which direct the vacuum pull to the different conduits that need it at specific points in the process. In addition, vacuum pump 26 may be coupled to the waste container 40 via a conduit, such as conduit 12f<br>
With reference to Figures 10 and 11, the pressure generated by the vacuum pump 26 can be used to direct the flow of fluids, including the regenerative cells, through the conduits i 2. This pressure can be supplied in multiple directions, for example, by automatically or manually controlling the position of one or more valves 14 in the system 10. The system 10 can be made to fiinction properly with the use of positive pressure or through the use of negative pressure, or combinations thereof. For instance, the regenerative cells can be pulled through the first and second filters described above into a soft sided container which is connected to the third filter. The soft-sided container can be in line (serial) connected ahead of the third filter. The final output chamber may be a soft sided container which is on the other side (e.g., the downstream side) of the third filter. In this embodiment, pressure is used<br><br>
to move the regenerative cells from one soft sided container to a second soft sided container through the filter.<br>
In another embodiment of the system 10, the filtration of the stem cells and/or adipose derived progenitor cells may be accomplished using a combination of percolative filtration and sedimentation. For example, such a system uses saline that is passed through a tissue regenerative cell composition (e.g., the composition containing the stem cells and/or adipose derived progenitor cells) and then through a filter. Some of the variables which are associated with percolative filtration of cells from a regenerative cell composition include, but are not limited to, pore size of the filter media, pore geometry or shape, surface area of the filter, flow direction of the regenerative cell composition being filtered, flow rate of the infused saline, trans-membrane pressure, dilution of the cell population, cell size and viability.<br>
In one embodiment of the system 10, the processing chamber 30 uses a filter assembly 36 which implements percolative filtration and sedimentation to separate and concentrate the regenerative cells. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the processing chamber 30 is defined as a generally cylindrical body having a sidewall 30a, a top surface 30b, and a bottom surface 30c, as shown in Figure 6. A sterile vent 32 is provided in the top surface 30b.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 6, the processing chamber 30 is illustrated as including a filter assembly 36, which includes two filters, such as large pore filter 36a, and small pore filter 36b. The pore sizes of the filters 36a and 36b typically are in a range between about 0.05 microns and about 10 microns. The large pore filter 36a may comprise pores with a diameter of about 5 nm, and the small pore filter 36b may comprise pores with a diameter of about 1-3 . In one embodiment, the filters have a surface area of about 785 mm2. Filters 36a and 36b divide an interior of the processing chamber 30 to include a first chamber 37a, a second chamber 37b, and a third chamber 37c. As shown in Figure 6, first chamber 37a is located between second chamber 37b and third chamber 37c. In addition, first chamber 37a is shown as being the region of the processing chamber 30 having an inlet port 31a and an outlet port 31b. The illustrated processing chamber 30 includes a plurality of ports providing communication paths from an exterior of the processing chamber 30 to the interior of the processing chamber 30, such as ports 31a, 31b, and 31c.    The ports 31a, 31b, and 31c, are illustrated as being disposed in the sidewall 30a of a body of the processing chamber 30. However, the ports 31 a, 3 lb, and 31 c could be positioned in other regions, as well. Port 31 a is illustrated as a sample inlet port, which is constructed to be coupled to a conduit so that a<br><br><br>
the saline. The sterile vent 32 is included in the chamber 30 to ensure that the correct pressure gradient is maintained in the three chambers within the processing unit. The upper chamber 37c can comprise an absorbent media 33. The purpose of the absorbent media is to trap the unwanted proteins in the solution to ensure that they do not cross the filter media back into the processing solution, if, for example, the saline flow rate decreases. An absorbent media can be a type of filter material that is absorbent, or attracts materials or components to be filtered out. An outflow port can be added above the top filter to help draw off the waste. .Another embodiment of this may be to apply a gentle vacuum from the top to help pull off waste. Absorbent media can be implemented when, as in the illustrated embodiment the flow rates are relatively small. Excess saline and proteins are then carried away to a waste container.<br>
then the larger cells, (e.g., the adipose derived stem cells and/or progenitor cells) have been sufficiently separated from smaller cells and proteins, the composition containing the separated cells may be concentrated, as discussed herein. The composition may be further concentrated after it has been removed from chamber 37a through outlet port 31b, or while it is in the chamber 37a. In one embodiment, the concentration of cells in the composition is increased in the following manner. After the cells have been sufficiently separated the filters, such as filters 36a and 36b, may be moved towards each other. This<br><br>
movement has the effect of reducing the volume between the two filters (e.g., the volume of chamber 37a). A vibrating member may also be provided in connection with the processing chamber 30 to facilitate concentrating of the cells in the composition. In one embodiment, the vibrating member may be coupled to the filter 36b (e.g., the small pore filter). Vibrating can reduce an incidence of cells becoming trapped in the filters. The reduction in volume of the composition allows the excess saline to be removed as waste and the cells to be concentrated in a smaller volume.<br>
In another embodiment, the concentration of the regenerative cells is accomplished in the following manner. After the cells have been sufficiently separated, the regenerative cell composition can be transferred to another chamber (not shown) which uses gravity to filter out the excess saline. In a preferred embodiment, the sedimentation can occur at the same time as the percolation. This sedimentation may be accomplished by introducing the composition on top of a filter which has a pore size ranging from about 10 kD to about 2 microns. In one embodiment, a suitable filter has a pore size of about 1 micron. The force of gravity will allow the saline and smaller particles to be passed through the filter while preventing the cells in the composition to flow through the filter. After the desired concentration of cells has been obtained, and after the filtered smaller particles have been removed from below the filter, the regenerative cell composition may be agitated to remove the cells from the filter and, subsequently, the concentrated regenerative cells may be transferred to the output bag. The smaller particles can be drawn off as waste through an outlet.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the regenerative cell composition from the collection chamber 20 is transported to the processing chamber 30 wherein the composition can be centrifiiged to separate and concentrate regenerative cells. Centrifugation principles are well know in the art and will be not be repeated herein in the interest of brevity. Standard, art-recognized centrifugation devices, components and parameters are utilized herein. An exemplary processing chamber for use as part of a centrifuge device is shown in Figures 7 and 8.   Typically, a centrifuge device causes a centrifuge chamber (such as the one shown in Figure 7) to spin around an axis to thereby increasing the force on the cells in the solution to be greater than gravity. The denser or heavier materials in the solution typically settle to one end of the centrifuge chamber, i.e., an output chamber 50 of Figure 7, to form a regenerative cell pellet. The pellet may then be re-suspended to obtain a solution with a desired concentration of cells and/or a desired volume of cells and medium. The processing chamber shown in Figure 7 is constructed to separate and concentrate cells using both centrifugal and<br><br><br>
Figure 9 illustrates principles associated with an elutriation implementation in accordance wth the present invention. The elutriation embodiment can be similar to a centrifugalion implementation to the extent that a force is applied to the solution using a spinning rotor. Some of the variables which are associated with the presently embodied elutriation sq?aration include, but are not limited to, the size and shape of the spinning chamber, the diameter of the rotor, the speed of the rotor, the diameter of the counter flow tubing, the flow rate of the counter flow, as well as the size and density of the particles and cells which are to be removed from solution. As in centrifiigation, the regenerative cells can be separated based on individual cell densities.<br>
In one embodiment the regenerative cell composition, e.g., the solution containing the regenerative cells and the collagenase, is introduced into a chamber of a spinning rotor, as shown in Figure 9.1. After the solution is added to the chamber additional saline is added to the chamber at a predetermined flow rate. The flow rate of the saline can be predetermined as a function of the speed of the rotor, the cell diameter, and the chamber constant which has been established empirically. The flow rate will be controlled for example with a device<br><br>
similar to an IV pump. A purpose of the additional saline is to provide a condition inside the rotor chamber where the larger particles will move to one side of the chamber and the smaller particles will move to the other, as illustrated in Figure 9.2. The flow is adjusted so that, in this application, the smaller particles will exit the chamber and move to a waste container, as shown in Figure 9.3. This movement results in the solution in the rotor chamber having a substantially homogenous population of cells, such as stem cells. After it has been determined that the stem cells have been separated from the rest of the items in the solution (with unwanted proteins and free lipids having been removed from the chamber), the counter flow is stopped. The cells inside the chamber will then form a concentrated pellet on the outside wall of the chamber. The counter flow is reversed and the cell pellet is transferred to the output bag.<br>
As previously set forth herein, the processing chamber 30 or the output chamber 50 may include one or more ports, e.g., ports 51 or 52. One or more of these ports may be designed to transport the regenerative cells obtained using any combination of methods described above, or a portion thereof, via conduits to other surgical devices, cell culturing devices, cell marinading devices, gene therapy devices or purification devices. These ports may also be designed to transport the regenerative cells via conduits to additional chambers or containers within the system or as part of another system for the same purposes described above. The ports and conduits may be also be used to add one or more additives, e.g., growth factors, re-suspension fluids, cell culture reagents, cell expansion reagents, cell preservation reagents or cell modification reagents including agents that transfer genes to the cells. The ports and conduits may also be used to transport the regenerative cells to other targets such as implant materials (e.g., scaffolds or bone fragments) as well as other surgical implants and devices.<br>
Further processing of the cells may also be initiated by reconfiguring the interconnections of the disposable sets of the existing system, re-programming the processing device of the existing system, by providing different or additional containers and/ or chambers for the existing system, by transporting the cells to a one or more additional systems or devices and/or any combinations thereof For example, the system can be reconfigured by any of the means described above such that the regenerative cells obtained using the system may be subject to one or more of the following: cell expansion (of one or more regenerative cell types)and cell maintenance (including cell sheet rinsing and media changing); sub-culturing; cell seeding; transient transfection (including seeding of transfected cells from bulk supply); harvesting (including enzymatic, non-enzymatic harvesting and<br><br><br>
chamber and placed into a second system providing the cell culture component. This could be in the form of a conventional laboratory tissue culture incubator or a Bioreactor-style device such as that described by Tsao et al., US Patent No. 6,001,642, or by Armstrong et al., US Patent No. 6^38,908. In an alternative embodiment, the cell expansion or cell culture component could be added to the existing system, e.g., into the output chamber, allowing for short-term adherence and'or cell culture of the adipose derived cell populations. This alternate embodiment would permit integration of the cell culture and^or cell expansion component to the system and remove the need for removing the cells from this system and placement within another.<br>
During the processing, one or more additives may be added to or provided with the various chambers or containers as needed to enhance the results. These additives may also be provided as part of another system associated with the existing system or separate from the existing system. For example, in certain embodiments, the additives are added or provided without the need for removing the regenerative cells from the system. In other embodiments, the additives are added or provided by connecting a new container or chamber comprising the additives into an unused port of the system in a sterile manner.   In yet other embodiments, the additives are added or provided in a second system or device that is not connected to the<br><br>
system of the present invention. Some examples of additives include agents that optimize washing and disaggregation, additives that enhance the viability of the active cell population during processing, anti-microbial agents (e.g., antibiotics), additives that lyse adipocytes and/or red blood cells, or additives that enrich for cell populations of interest (by differential adherence to solid phase moieties or to otherwise promote the substantial reduction or enrichment of cell populations) as described herein.<br>
For example, to obtain a homogenous regenerative cell population, any suitable method for separating and concentrating the particular regenerative cell type may be employed, such as the use of cell-specific antibodies that recognize and bind antigens present on, for example, stem cells or progenitor cells, e.g., endothelial precursor cells. These include both positive selection (selecting the target cells), negative selection (selective removal of unwanted cells), or combinations thereof. Intracellular markers such as enzymes may also be used in selection using molecules which fluoresce when acted upon by specific enzymes. In addition, a solid phase material with adhesive properties selected to allow for differential adherence and/or elution of a particular population of regenerative cells within the final cell pellet could be inserted into the output chamber of the system.<br>
An alternate embodiment of this differential adherence approach would include use of antibodies and/or combinations of antibodies recognizing surface molecules differentially expressed on target regenerative cells and unwanted cells. Selection on the basis of expression of specific cell surface markers (or combinations thereof) is another commonly applied technique in which antibodies are attached (directly or indirecdy) to a solid phase support structure (Geiselhart et al, 1996; Formanek et al., 1998; Graepler et al., 1998; Kobari et al., 2001; Mohr et al., 2001).<br>
In another embodiment the cell pellet could be re-suspended, layered over (or under) a fluid material formed into a continuous or discontinuous density gradient and placed in a centrifuge for separation of cell populations on the basis of cell density. In a similar embodiment continuous flow approaches such as apheresis (Smith, 1997), and elutriation (with or without counter-current) (Lasch et al., 2000) (Ito and Shinomiya, 2001) may also be employed.<br>
Other examples of additives may include additional biological or structural components, such as cell differentiation factors, growth promoters, immunosuppressive agents, medical devices, or any combinations thereof, as discussed herein. For example, other cells, tissue, tissue fragments, growth factors such as VEGF and other known angiogenic or arteriogenic growth factors, biologically active or inert compounds, resorbable<br><br><br>
When the cells and/or rissue containing the cells are administered to a patient other than the patient from whom the cells and/or tissue were obtained, one or more immunosuppressive agents may be administered to the patient receiving the cells and/or tissue to reduce, and preferably prevent, rejection of the transplant. As used herein, the term "immunosuppresive drug or agent" is intended to include pharmaceutical agents which inhibit or interfere with normal immune function. Examples of immunosuppressive agents suitable with the methods disclosed herein include agents that inhibit T-cell/B-cell costimulation pathways, such as agents that interfere with the coupling of T-cells and B-cells \iz the CTLA4 and B7 pathways, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 20020182211. A preferred immunosuppressive agent is cyclosporine A. Other examples include myophenylate mofetil, rapamicin, and anti-thymocyte globulin. In one embodiment, the immunosuppressive drug is administered with at least one other therapeutic agent. The immunosuppressive drug is administered in a formulation which is compatible with the route<br><br>
of administration and is administered to a subject at a dosage sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In another embodiment, the immunosuppressive drug is administered transiently for a sufficient time to induce tolerance to the regenerative cells of the invention.<br>
In these embodiments, the regenerative cells may be contacted, combined, mixed or added to the additives through any art recognized manner, including devices such as the agitation devices and associated methods described herein. For example, rocking, inversion, compression pulsed or moving rollers may be used.<br>
In another aspect, the cell population could be placed into the recipient and surrounded by a resorbable plastic sheath or other materials and related components such as those manufactured by MacroPore Biosurgery, Inc. (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,269,716; 5,919.234; 6,673,362; 6,635,064; 6,653,146; 6,391,059; 6,343,531; 6,280,473).<br>
In all of the foregoing embodiments, at least a portion of the separated and concentrated regenerative cells may be cryopreserved, as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/242,094, entitled PRESERVATION OF NON EMBRYONIC CELLS FROM NON HEMATOPOIETIC TISSUES, filed September 12, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/322,070 filed September 14, 2001, which is commonly assigned, and the contents of which in their entireties are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
At the end of processing, the regenerative cells may be manually retrieved from the output chamber. The cells may be loaded into a delivery device, such as a syringe, for placement into the recipient by either, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or other technique allowing delivery of the cells to the target site within the patient. In other words, cells may be placed into the patient by any means known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred embodiments include placement by needle or catheter, or by direct surgical implantation. In other embodiments, the cells may be automatically transported to an output chamber which may be in the form of a container, syringe or catheter etc., which may be used to place the cells in the patient. The container may also be used to store the cells for later use or for cryopreservation. All retrieval methods are performed in a sterile manner. In the embodiment of surgical implantation, the cells could be applied in association with additives such as a preformed matrix or scaffold as described herein.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention (e.g., the embodiment shown in Figure 4), the system is automated. In another embodiment, the system has both automated and manual components. The system may be comprised of one or more disposable components connected to or mounted on a re-usable hardware component or module. The automated<br><br><br>
The software may also allow automation of steps such as controlling the ingress and egress of fluids and tissues along particular tubing paths by controlling pumps and valves of the system; controlling the proper sequence and/or direction of activation; detecting blockages with pressure sensors; mixing mechanisms, measuring the amount of tissue and/or fluid to be moved along a particular pathway using volumetric mechanisms; maintaining temperatures of the various components using heat control devices; and integrating the separation and corxentration process with timing and software mechanisms. The processing device can also control centrifuge speeds based on the tissue type being processed and/or the cell population or sub-population being harvested, and the types of procedures to be performed (e.g., tissue enhancement using adipose tissue augmented with regenerative cells, or processing of cells for bone repair applications using regenerative cell coated bone grafts). The processing device may also include standard parallel or serial ports or other means of communicating with other computers or networks. Accordingly, the processing device can<br><br>
be a stand alone unit or be associated one or more additional devices for the further processing methods described herein.<br>
The software may allow for automated collection of "run data" including, for example, the lot numbers of disposable components, temperature and volume measurements, tissue volume and cell number parameters, dose of enzyme applied, incubation time, operator identity, date and time, patient identity, etc. In a preferred embodiment of the device a character recognition system, such as a bar code reading system would be integrated to permit data entry of these variables (for example disposable set lot number and expiration date, lot number and expiration date of the Collagenase, patient/sample identifiers, etc.) into the processing device as part of documentation of processing. This would reduce the opportunity for data entry errors. Such a bar code reading system could be easily incorporated into the processing device using a USB or other interface port and system known to the art. In this way the device would provide integrated control of the data entry and documentation of the process. A print-out report of these parameters would be part of the user-defined parameters of a programmed operation of the system. Naturally this would require integration of a printer component (hardware and driver) or printer driver in software plus an interface output connector for a printer (e.g., a USB port) in the hardware of the device.<br>
In certain embodiments, the system is a fully automated system. For example, the user may initially select the amount of tissue to be processed, attach the system to the patient and the system may automatically aspirate the required tissue and separate and concentrate regenerative cells in an uninterrupted sequence without further user input. The user may also input the amount of regenerative cells required and allow the system to aspirate the requisite amount of tissue and process the tissue. A fully automated system also includes a system which is capable of being reconfigured based on a number of (e.g., two or more) user input parameters, e.g., number of wash cycles, speed of centrifugation etc. The system can also be run in semi-automatic mode during which the system goes through certain steps without user intervention but requires user intervention before certain processes can occur. In other embodiments, the system is a single integrated system that displays instructions to guide the user to perform predetermined operations at predetermined times. For example, the processing device may prompt users through the steps necessary for proper insertion of tubing, chambers and other components of the system. Accordingly, the user can ensure that the proper sequence of operations is being performed. Such a system can additionally require confirmation of each operational step by the user to prevent inadvertent activation or<br><br><br>
system, the collection chamber 20 and the processing chamber 30 are connected by way of conduits !2 that are housed in a rigid frame. The rotating seal network (Figures 7 &amp; 8) of a processing chamber 30 may also be housed in the same rigid frame. In another preferred embodiment, the various chambers and containers of the disposable set are comprised of the necessary interfaces that are capable of communicating with the processing device of the system such that the pumps, valves, sensors and other devices that automate the system are appropriately activated or de-activated as needed without user intervention. The interfaces also reduce the rime and expertise required to set up the system and also reduce errors by indicating how to properly set up the system and alerting the user in the event of an erroneous setup.<br>
Most of the disposable sets of the invention will have many common elements. However, the ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that different applications of the system may require additional components which may be part of the disposable sets. Accordingly,<br><br>
the disposable sets may further comprise one or more needles or syringes suitable for obtaining adipose or other tissue from the patient and returning regenerative cells to the patient. The type number and variety of the needles and syringes included will depend on the type and amount of tissue being processed. The disposable sets may further comprise one or more rigid or flexible containers to hold washing fluids and other processing reagents used in the system. For example, the disposable sets may comprise containers to hold saline, enzymes and any other treatment or replacement fluids required for the procedure. In addition, suitable washing solutions, re-suspension fluids, additives, agents or transplant materials may be provided with the disposable sets for use in conjunction with the systems and methods of the invention.<br>
Any combination of system components, equipment or supplies described herein or otherwise required to practice the invention may be provided in the form of a kit. For example, a kit of the invention may include, e.g., the optimal length and gage needle for the syringe based liposuction and sterile syringes which contain the preferred filter media which allows for the processing of small volumes of tissue. Other exemplary equipment and supplies which may be used with the invention and may also be included with the kits of the invention are listed in Tables 11 and III.<br>
Table II below identifies examples of supplies that can be used in to obtain adipose derived regenerative cell in accordance with the systems and methods of the present invention:<br><br><br><br>
The re-usable component of the system comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the agitation mechanism for the collection chamber, the pump, and assorted sensors which activate valves and pump controls, the centrifuge motor, the rotating frame of the centrifuge motor, the user interface screen and USB ports, an interlocking or docking device or configuration to connect the disposable set such that the disposable set is securely attached to<br><br>
and interface with the re-usable hardware component and other associated devices. An exemplary re-usable component is illustrated in Figure 14. In preferred embodiments, the reusable component includes a means for separating and concentrating the regenerative cells from the regenerative cell composition, e.g., a rotating centrifuge. In this embodiment, the re-usable component is designed connect to and interface with a portion of the processing chamber (comprising a centrifuge chamber) of the disposable set as shown in Figure 15 A. It is understood that the means for separating and concentrating regenerative cells in the reusable component is not limited to a rotating centrifuge but may also include any other configuration described herein, including a spinning membrane filter. The re-usable component may also house the processing device described herein which contains preprogrammed software for carrying out several different tissue processing procedures and selectively activating the various pumps and valves of the system accordingly.   The processor may also include data storage capability for storing donor/patient information, processing or collection information and other data for later downloading or compilation. The re-usable component may be used with a variety of disposable sets. The disposable set is connected to the re-usable component through, e.g., an interlocking device or configuration to connect the disposable set such that the disposable set is securely attached to and interfaces with the re-usable hardware component in a manner that the processing device present on the re-usable component can control, i.e., send and receive signals to and from the various components of the disposable set as well as various components of the re-usable component and other associated devices and systems.<br>
In one embodiment, a disposable set for use in the system is comprised of a collection chamber 20 which can accommodate about 800 mL of tissue; a processing chamber 30 which can process the regenerative cell composition generated by about 800 mL of tissue washed and digested in the collection chamber 20; an output chamber 50 which can accommodate at least 0.5 mL of regenerative cells; and a waster container 40 which can accommodate about 10 L of waste. In this embodiment, the hardware device is no larger than 24"L X 18"W X 36"H. Alternative dimensions of the various components of the disposable sets as well as the hardware device may be constructed as needed and are intended to be encompassed by the present invention without limitation.<br>
The disposable components of the system are easy to place on the device. An illustration of a disposable set utilized assembled together with a corresponding re-usable component is illustrated in Figure 15A, The system is preferably designed such that it can detect an improperly loaded disposable component. For example, the components of each<br><br><br>
A manual embodiment of the system of the invention may be practiced in accordance with the following steps and information, which are provided by way of example apd not by way oflimitation. First, adipose tissue is collected from a patient. A tissue retrieval line, or sampling site coupler, is opened and a spike is inserted into a side port of the 600ml blood bag. Approximately 10ml of adipose tissue is collected in a 10ml syringe through the blunt cannula. The blunt cannula is replaced with a relatively sharp needle (14G). The sampling site is wiped with an iodine wipe. The adipose tissue is injected into the 600ml bag through the sampling site. The syringe and needle are then discarded in a sharps chamber. These steps are repeated to place sufficient tissue into the bag. Sufficient tissue is determined on a case-by case basis based on the clinical specifics of the patient and application.<br>
Second, the aspirated adipose tissue is washed. A pre-warmed (37°C) saline bag is hooked above the work surface. A blue hempostat clamp is placed on the tubing between the 6Wkn] bag and the spike. The clamp is closed to seal the tubing. The spike on the 600ml bag is used to enter the saline bag (in this setting use the needle on the 600ml bag to enter the saline bag through the rubber septum, wipe the septum with iodine prior to insertion of needle). The blue clamp is released and approximately 150ml of saline is allowed to enter<br><br>
the 600ml bag. The blue clamp is closed when the desired volume of saline has entered the 600ml bag. The 600ml bag is inverted 10-15 times over approximately 15 seconds. A second blue clamp is applied to the tubing leading from the 3L waste bag to the spike. The spike on the 3L bag is used to enter the 600ml bag. The 600ml bag is hung inverted over the work surface, and is allowed to sit for approximately 1 minute. The blue clamp leading to the 3L bag is released. Waste fluid is allowed to flow into the 3L bag. The blue clamp is applied to stop the flow before tissue enters the tubing. The 600ml bag is lowered to the work surface. These steps are repeated two more times. If the saline waste still appears noticeably red, a third additional cycle is indicated. A heat sealer is used to seal the tubing between the 3L waste bag and the 600ml bag. The seal is made at approximately the halfway point on the tubing. The 3L waste bag is removed and discarded. The 600 ml bag is returned to the work surface.<br>
Third, the washed adipose tissue is digested. The blue clamp on the tubing between the saline and the 600ml bag is released to allow approximately 150ml of saline to enter the 600ml bag. The sampling site on the 600ml bag is wiped with an iodine wipe. Collagenase is injected through the sampling site to the 600ml bag. The collagenase is prepared by thawing one collagenase vial in a 37°C water bath or equivalent, other than microwaving. A 1ml syringe with a 22G needle is inserted into the vial. The collagenase is withdrawn into the needle. The needle is removed and replaced with a 02\im filter and second 22G needle. The collagenase is then expelled from the syringe through the 0.2 \xm filter and needle. Digestion of the adipose tissue is performed at a final collagenase concentration of 0.1-0.2 Wiinsch units/mL The heating pad is placed on the rocker. During this time, the saline bag, while still attached, is set to the side of the rocker. Care is taken to ensure that the tubing leading to the saline bag is positioned in such a way that it does not get caught on the rocker when in motion. The heating pad controller is set to 37X. The 600ml bag is placed on the rocker. The rocker is set to maximum. The bag is observed to ensure that it is stable, and is allowed to rock for approximately 1 hour (55O mins).<br>
Fourth, the regenerative cell composition is retrieved. The bag is removed from the rocker. A blue clamp is applied to the closed tubing formerly leading to the waste bag. The sterile connecting device is used to attach the quad bag set (pre-prepared according to the following instructions) to the tubing that was formerly attached to the waste bag. The quad pack can be seen as two linked quad packs. Identify the tubing splitting it into two packs, fold the tubing back on itself, and slip a metal loop over the folded tubing (over both pieces of tubing). Slide the loop down approx 0.5 inch. The crimp formed at the bend acts to seal<br><br><br>
Fifth, the regenerative cell composition is washed. A metal clip is placed on the tubing  bags to seal the tubing. The quad set is placed on a balance. Water is added to a second "dummy" quad set to balance the quad set. The quad set and balanced set are placed on opposite buckets of the centrifuge. For the hollow filter, the cells are washed and placed in the bag, and tubing is sealed between the bag and the hollow fiber filter assembly described above. Using a peristaltic pump, the fluid is run through the filter assembly and the cell concentrate is collected in a bag on the downstream end. Care is taken to make sure the quad set bags are not compressed and are upright. The centrifuge is operated at 400xg for 10 minutes. The quad set is removed from the centrifuge and placed in the plasma expressor. Care is taken to place the bags in the expressor in such a way that the hard tubing at the top of the bag is just at the top of the backplate. If the bag is too high, too much saline will be retained, if it is too low the tubing will interfere with the front plate's abi!it&gt;' to close and again too much saline will be retained. A blue clamp is applied to each of the lines leading from the full quad set to the empty one. The metal loops and blue clamps are removed to allow supernatant to flow into the empty quad set. As much saline as possible is expressed off, but care is taken not to dislodge the cell pellet. The tubing running into each<br><br>
of the bags containing supernatant is heat sealed. The waste bags containing the supernatant are removed. Blue clamps are applied to the tubing leading to each of the quad set bags containing cells. The bags are taken out of the plasma expressor. A sterile connecting device is used to connect the tubing leading to the quad pack to the saline bag. The blue clamp leading to one of the quad set bags is removed to allow approximately 150ml saline to flow into the bag, and then the clamp is reapplied to stop the flow of saline. The full quad set bag is then inverted approximately 10-15 times for approximately 15 seconds. The blue clamp leading to the empty quad set bag is then removed and all of the contents of full bag are drained into the empty bag. The metal loop clamp is reapplied to seal the tubing between two quad set bags. The tubing is then heat sealed and the saline bag is removed. The full quad set bag is then inverted approximately 10-15 times over approximately 15 seconds. Another dummy quad set is placed on a balance and is re-balanced to the cell quad set. The quad set bags (one full, one empty) are then placed into the centrifuge so that the quad set bags are not compressed and are upright.<br>
The centrifuge is operated at about 400xg for 10 minutes. The quad set is then removed from the centrifuge and is placed carefully in the plasma expressor in such a way that the hard tubing at the top of the bag is just at the top of the backplate. If the bag is too high too much saline will be retained, if it is too low the tubing will interfere with the front plate's ability to close and again too much saline will be retained. The metal loop is removed to express all the supernatant from the full bag into the empty bag taking care not to dislodge the regenerative cell pellet. The tubing between the bags is sealed, and the full (waste) bag is removed and discarded. A new sampling site coupler is then inserted into the remaining bag. The cells of the cell pellet are then resuspended in the residual saline (if any) to obtain a concentration of regenerative cells. The resuspension can be performed by gentle manipulation of the bag (e.g., squeezing and rubbing).<br>
A particular example of the system embodying the present invention is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 illustrates an automated system and method for separating and concentrating regenerative cells from tissue, e.g., adipose tissue, suitable for re-infusion within a patient. In certain embodiments of the system shown in Figure 4, the system further includes an automated step for aspirating a given amount of tissue from the patient. The system shown in Figure 4 is comprised of the disposable set shown in Figure 13 which is connected to the re-usable component of the system shown in Figure 14 to arrive at an automated embodiment of the system shown in Figure 15 A. The disposable set is connected to the re-usable component through, e.g., an interlocking or docking device or configuration,<br><br><br>
A sensor 29 can signal the processing device present in the re-usable component to activate the steps needed to wash and disaggregate the tissue. For example, the processing device may introduce a pre-set volume of washing agent based on the volume of tissue collected using automated valves and pumps. This cycle may be repeated in the collection chamber until the optical sensor determines that the effluent liquid is sufficiently clear and devoid of unwanted material. For example, an optical sensor 29 along the conduit leading out of the collection chamber 12b or 12d can detect that the unwanted materials have been<br><br>
removed and can signal the processing device to close the required valves and initiate the next step..<br>
Next, the processing device may introduce a pre-programmed amount of disaggregation agent based on the volume of tissue collected. The processing device may also activate agitation of the tissue in the collection chamber for a preset period of time based on the initial volume of tissue collected or based on user input. In the embodiment shown in Figure 4, once the disaggregation agent, e.g., collagenase, is added to the collection chamber 20 through the collagenase source 24, the motor in the collection chamber 20 is activated via the processing device. The motor activates the rotatable shaft 25 which is comprised of a magnetic stirrer and a paddle-like device wherein one or more paddles 25a are rigidly attached to the filter cage 27 of a filter prefixed to the collection chamber 28. The paddles agitate the in the presence of the disaggregation agent such that the regenerative cells separate from the tissue.<br>
The solution in the collection chamber 20 is allowed to settle for a preset period of time. The buoyant portion of the solution is allowed to rise to the top of the solution. Once the preset period of time elapses, the necessary valves and pumps are activated by the processing device to remove the non-buoyant portion to the waste chamber 40. The transfer into the waste chamber 40 continues until a sensor 29 along the conduit leading out of the collection chamber 12b or 12d can detect that the buoyant fraction of the solution is about to be transferred to the waste chamber 30. For example, a sensor 29 along the conduit leading out of the collection chamber 12b or 12d can detect that the unwanted materials have been removed and can signal the processing device to close the required valves.<br>
At this time the non-buoyant fraction of the solution, i.e., the regenerative cell composition, is moved to the processing chamber 30. This is accomplished through the use of the necessary valves and peristaltic pumps. In certain embodiments, before transfer of the regenerative cell composition to the processing chamber 30, an additional volume of saline may be added to the buoyant fraction of solution remaining in the collection chamber 20. Another wash cycle may be repeated. After this cycle, the solution is allowed to settle and the non-buoyant fraction (which contains the regenerative cells) is transported to the processing chamber 30 and the buoyant fraction is drained to the waste chamber 40.   The additional wash cycle is used to optimize transfer of all the separated regenerative cells to the processing chamber 30.<br>
Once the regenerative cell composition is transported to the processing chamber 30 by way of conduits 12, the composition may be subject to one or more additional washing steps<br><br><br>
shovru) referred lo herein as races. These races may be separated by precision ground spheres. Tne races and spheres comprising the bearings are preferably fabricated with materia] suitable for contact with bodily fluid, or are coated with material suitable for contact with bodily fluid. In a preferred embodiment, the races and spheres are fabricated using, for example, silicone nitride or zirconia. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the three lip seals are comprised of a circular "U" shaped channel (not shown) as well as a circular spring (not shown). The circular "U'* shaped channel is preferably fabricated using flexible material such that a leakage proof junction with the rotating shaft of the rotating seal network 30.1 is formed. Additionally, the lip seals are preferably oriented in a manner such that pressure<br><br>
from the regenerative cell composition flowing through the processing chamber causes the seal assembly to tighten its junction with the rotating shaft by way of increased tension. The seals may be secured in position by way of one or more circular clips (not shown) which are capable of expanding and/or collapsing as needed in order to engage a groove in the outer housing 30.2 of the rotating seal network 30.1. The heat generated by or near the rotating seal network 30.1 must be controlled to prevent lysis of the cells in the solution which is being moved through the passage. This may be accomplished by, for example, selecting a hard material for constructing the rotating shaft, polishing the area of the rotating shaft which comes in contact with the seals and minimizing contact between the rotating shaft and the seal.<br>
In another embodiment the rotating seal network 30.1 is comprised of a single rubber seal 30.3 and an air gasket (not shown). This seal and gasket provide a tortuous path for any biologic matter which could compromise the sterility of the system. In another embodiment the rotating seal network 30.1 is comprised of multiple spring loaded seals 30.3 which isolate the individual fluid paths. The seals 30.3 are fabricated of a material which can be sterilized as well as seal the rotating shaft without lubricant. In another embodiment the rotating seal network 30.1 is compromised of a pair of ceramic disks (not shown) which create the different fluid paths and can withstand the rotation of the system and not cause cell lysis. In another embodiment the fluid pathway is flexible and is allowed to wind and unwind with respect to the processing chamber. This is accomplished by having the flexible fluid pathway rotate one revolution for every two revolutions of the processing chamber 30. This eliminates the need for a rotating seal altogether.<br>
The regenerative cell composition is pumped from the collection chamber 20 along a fluid path through the axis of rotation of the rotating seal network 30.1 and then divides into a minimum of two fluid pathways 30.5 each of which radiate outward from the central axis of the processing chamber 30 and terminate near the outer ends of the processing chamber 30, i.e., within the centrifuge chambers which house the output chambers 50 (Figure 7 and 8). Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the processing chamber 30 is comprised of two or more output chambers 50 as shown in Figures 7 and 8. These output chambers 50 are positioned such that they are in one orientation during processing 30.7 and another orientation for retrieval of concentrated regenerative cells 30.8. For example, the output changes are tilted in one angle during processing and another angle for cell retrieval. The cell retrieval angle is more vertical than the processing angle. The two positions of the output chamber 50 may be manually manipulated through a handle 53 which protrudes out of the<br><br><br>
approximately 400 times the force of gravity for a period of approximately 5 minutes. The output chamber 50 is constructed such that the outer extremes of the chamber form a small reservoir for the dense particles and cells. The output chamber 50 retains the dense particles in what is termed a 'cell pellet', while allowing the lighter supernatant to be removed through a fluid path, e.g.. a fluid path which is along the axis of rotation of the rotating seal network 30.1 and travels from the low point in the center of the processing chamber 30 through the rotating seal netuoric 30.1 to the waste container 40. The valves 14 and pumps 34 signal the processing device to activate steps to remove the supernatant to the waste container 40 without disturbing the cell pellet present in the output chamber 50.<br>
The cell pellet that is obtained using the system shown in Figure 4 comprises the concentrated regenerative cells of the invention. In some embodiments, after the supernatant is removed and directed to the waste chamber 40, a fluid path 30.5 may be used to re-suspend the cell pellet that is formed after centrifugation with additional solutions and/or other additives.   Re-suspension of the cell pellet in this manner allows for further washing of the<br><br>
regenerative cells to remove unwanted proteins and chemical compounds as well as increasing the flow of oxygen to the cells. The resulting suspension may be subjected to another load of approximately 400 times the force of gravity for another period of approximately 5 minutes. After a second cell pellet is formed, and the resulting supernatant is removed to the waste chamber 40, a final wash in the manner described above may be performed with saline or some other appropriate buffer solution.   This repeated washing can be performed multiple times to enhance the purity of the regenerative cell solution. In certain embodiments, the saline can be added at any step as deemed necessary to enhance processing. The concentrations of regenerative cells obtained using the system shown in Figure 4 may vary depending on amount of tissue collected, patient age, patient profile etc. Exemplary yields are provided in Table 1.<br>
The final pellet present in the output chamber 50 may then be retrieved in an aseptic manner using an appropriate syringe after the output chamber 50 is positioned in the orientation appropriate for cell removal.   In other embodiments, the final pellet may be automatically moved to a container in the in the output chamber 50 which may be removed and stored or used as needed. This container may be in any appropriate form or size. For example, the container may be a syringe.   In certain embodiments, the output container 50 itself may be heat sealed (either automatically or manually) and isolated from the other components of the processing chamber for subsequent retrieval and use of the regenerative cells in therapeutic applications as described herein including re-infusion into the patient. The cells may also be subject to further processing as described herein either prior to retrieval from the output chamber or after transfer to a second system or device. The re-usable component shown in Figure 14 is constructed such that it can be connected to one or more additional systems or devices for ftirther processing as needed.<br>
