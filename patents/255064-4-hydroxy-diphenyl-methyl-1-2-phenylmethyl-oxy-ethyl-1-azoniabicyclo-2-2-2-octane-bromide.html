				<td>The present invention relates to 4-[hydroxy(diphenyl)methyl]-l-{2-[(phenylmethyl)oxy]ethyl}-l-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide.<br>
This invention relates to novel quinuclidines derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions, and use thereof in treating muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediated diseases of the respiratory tract.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acetylcholine released from cholinergic neurons in the peripheral and central nervous systems affects many different biological processes through interaction with two major classes of acetylcholine receptors -the nicotinic and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors that have seven transmembrane domains: There are five subtypes of mAChRs, termed M1-M5, and each is the product of a<br>
distinct gene. Each of these five subtypes displays unique pharmacological properties. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are widely distributed in vertebrate organs where they mediate many of the vital functions. Muscarinic receptors can mediate both inhibitory and excitatory actions. For example, in smooth muscle found in the airways, M3 mAChRs mediate contractile responses. For review, please see Coalfield (1993<br>
Pharmac. Ther. 58:319-79).<br>
In the lungs, mAChRs have been localized to smooth muscle in the trachea and bronchi, the submucosal glands, and the parasympathetic ganglia. Muscarinic receptor density is greatest in parasympathetic ganglia and then decreases in density from me submucosal glands to tracheal and then bronchial smooth muscle. Muscarinic receptors are nearly absent from the alveoli. For review of mAChR expression and function in me lungs, please see Fryer and Jacoby (1998 Am J Respir Crit Care Med l58(5, pt 3) S 154-60).<br>
Three subtypes of mAChRs have been identified as important in the lungs, M1, M2 and M3 mAChRs. The M3 mAChRs, located on airway smooth muscle, mediate muscle contraction. Stimulation of M3 mAChRs activates the enzyme phospholipase C via binding of the stimulatory G protein Gq/11 (Gs), leading to liberation of<br>
phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate, resulting in phosphorylation of contractile proteins. MS mAChRs are also found on pulmonary submucosal glands. Stimulation of this population of MS mAChRs results in mucus secreţi on.<br>
M2 mAChRs make up approximately 50-80% of the cholinergic receptor population on airway smooth muscles.   Although the precise function is still unknown, they inhibit catecholaminergic relaxation of airway smooth muscle via inhibition of cAMP generation. Neuronal M2 mAChRs are located on postganglionic parasympathetic nerves. Under normal physiologic conditions, neuronal Mă mAChRs provide tight control of acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves. Inhibitory Mă mAChRs have also been demonstrated on sympathetic nerves in the lungs of some species. These receptors inhibit release of noradrenaline, thus decreasing sympathetic input to the lungs.<br>
MI mAChRs are found in the pulmonary parasympathetic ganglia where they function to enhance neurotransmission. These receptors have also been localized to the peripheral lung parenchyma, however their function in the parenchyma is unknown.<br>
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor dysfunction in the lungs has been noted in a variety of different pathophysiological states. In particular, in asthma and chronic obstructive puhnonary disease (COPD), inflammatory conditions lead to loss of inhibitory M2 muscarinic acetylcholine autoreceptor function on parasympathetic<br>
nerves supplying the pulmonary smooth muscle, causing increased acetylcholine release following vagal nerve stimulation (Fryer et al. 1999 Life Sci 64 (6-7) 449-55). This mAChR dysfunction results in airway hyperreactivity and hyperresponsiveness mediated by increased stimulation of M3 mAChRs. Thus the identification of potent<br>
mAChR antagonists would be useful as therapeutics in these mAChR-mediated disease states.<br>
COPD is an imprecise term that encompasses a variety of progressive health    i problems including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and emphysema, and it is a major căuşe of mortality and morbidity in the world. Smoking is the major risk factor for the development of COPD; nearly 50 million people in the U.S. alone smoke cigarettes, and an estimated 3,000 people take up the habit daily. As a result, COPD is expected to rank among the top five as a world-wide health burden by the year 2020.<br><br>
Inhaled anti-cholinergic therapy is currently considered the "gold standard" as first line therapy for COPD (Pauwels et al. 2001 Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 163:1256-1276).<br>
Despite the large body of evidence supporting the use of anti-cholinergic therapy for the treatment of airway hyperreactive diseases, relatively few anti-cholinergic compounds are available for use in the clinic for pulmonary indications.<br>
More specifically, in United States, Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent©! and<br>
Combivent©, in combination with albuterol) is currently the only inhaled anti-cholinergic marketed for the treatment of airway hyperreactive diseases. While this compound is a potent anti-muscarinic agent, it is short acting, and thus must be administered as many as four times daily in order to provide relief for the COPD patient. In Europe and Asia, the long-acting anti-cholinergic Tiotropium Bromide<br>
(Spiriva©) was recently approved, however this product is currently not available in the United States. Thus, there remains a need for novei compounds that are capable of causing blockade at mAChRs which are long acting and can be administered once-daily for the treatment of airway hyperreactive diseases such as asthma and COPD.<br>
Since mAChRs are widely distributed throughout the body, the ability to apply anti-cholinergics locally and/or topically to the respiratory tract is particularly advantageous, as it would allow for lower doses of the drug to be utilized. Furthermore, the ability to design topically active drugs that have long duration of action, and in particular, are retained either at the receptor or by the lung, would allow the avoidance of unwanted side effects that may be seen with systemic anti-cholinergic use.<br>

METHODS OFPREPARATION.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may be obtained by applying synthetic procedures, some of which are illustrated in the Schemes below. The synthesis provided in this Scheme is applicable for producing compounds of Formula (I) having a variety of different Rl, R2 and R3 groups which are reacted, employing substituents which are suitably protected, to achieve compatibility with the reactions outlined herein. Subsequent deprotection, in tliose cases, then affords compounds of the nature generally disclosed. While the Schemes are shown with compounds only of Formula (I), this is merely for illustration purpose only.<br>
As shown in Scheme l, the desired compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared in four synthetic steps from the commercially available ethyl 4-piperidinecarboxylate precursor 1. Compound l is reacted with l-bromo-2-chloroethane following standard alkylation procedures well known in the art such as potassium carbonate in acetone followed by reaction of the intermediate with lithium diisopropylamide in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofurann to give the quinuclidine intermediate 2. Condensation of compound 2<br>
with organometallic reagents such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium derivative in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, results in the formation of the tertiary alcohol 3 of Formula (I) (Rl= nothing).   Further N-alkylation of compound 3 with a suitable alkyl halide in a organic solvent such as chloroform or acetontirile gives compound 4 of Formula (I) (Rl not nothing).<br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
The inhibitory effects of compounds at the Mş mAChR of the present invention are determined by the following in vitro and in vivo funcţional assays:<br>
Analysis of Inhibition of Receptor Activation by Calcium Mobilization:<br>
Stimulaţi on of mAChRs expressed on CHO cells were analyzed by monitoring receptor-activated calcium mobilization as previously described (H. M.Sarau et al, 1999. Mol. Pharmacol 56, 657-663). CHO cells stably expressing Mş mAChRs were<br>
plated in 96 well black wall/clear bottom plates. After 1 8 to 24 hours, media was aspirated and replaced with 100 1 of load media (EMEM with Earl's salts, 0.1% RIA-grade BSA (Sigma, St. Louis MO), and 4 pM Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester fluorescent indicator dye (Fluo-3 AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated l hr at 37° C. The dye-containing media was then aspirated, replaced with fresh media (without Fluo-3 AM), and cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. Cells were then washed 3 times and incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C in 100 [îl of assay buffer (0.1% gelatin (Sigma), 120 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KC1, l mMKHfc PO4, 25 mM NaH CO^, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1 1 mM glucose, 20mM HEPES (pH 7.4)). 50 jil of compound<br>
(IxlO'l l - lxlO"5 M final in the assay) was added and the plates were incubated for 10 min. at 37° C. Plates were then placed into a fluorescent light intensity plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Probes) where the dye loaded cells were exposed to excitation light (488 nm) from a 6 watt argon laser. Cells were activated by adding 50 (0,1 of acetylcholine (0.1-10 nM final), prepared hi buffer containing 0.1% BSA, at a rate of . 50 fii/sec. Calcium mobilization, monitored as change in cytosolic calcium concentration, was measured as change in 566 nm emission intensity. The change in emission intensity is directly related to cytosolic calcium levels. The emitted fluorescence from all 96 wells is measured simultaneously using a cooled CCD camera. Data points are collected every second. This data was then plotting and analyzed using GraphPad PRISM software.<br>
Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction - potency and duratiou of action<br>
Airway responsiveness to methacholine was determined in awake, unrestrained Balb C mice (n = 6 each group). Barometric plethysmography was used to measure enhanced pause (Penh), a unitless measure that has been shown to correlate with the changes in airway resistance that occur during bronchial challenge with methacholine(2). Mice were pre-treated with 50 jil of compound (0.003-10 u.g/mouse) in 50 ui of vehicle (10% DMSO) intranasally (i.n.) and were then placed in the plethysmography chamber a given amount of time following drug administration (15 min - 96 h). For potency determination, a dose response to a given drug was performed, and all measurements were taken 15 min following i.n. drug administration. For duration of action determination, measurements were taken anywhere from 15 min to 96 hours following i.n. drug administration.<br>
Once in the chamber, the mice were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before taking a baseline Penh measurement for 5 minutes. Mice were then challenged with an aerosol of methacholine (10 mg/ml) for 2 minutes. Penh was recbrded continuously for 7 min starting at the inception of the methacholine aerosol, and continuing for 5 minutes afterward. Data for each mouse were analyzed and plotted by using GraphPad PRISM software. This experiment allows the determination of duration of activity of the administered compound.<br>
The present compounds are useful for treating a variety of indications, including but not limited to respiratory-tract disorders such as chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic respiratory obstruction, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, and allergic rhinitis.<br>
Muscarinic Receptor Radioligand Binding Assays<br>
Radioligand binding studies using 0.5 nM [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine (NMS) in a SPA format is used to assess binding of muscarinic antagonists to Mi, M.2, MS, M4 and MS muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In a 96-well plate, the SPA beads are pre-incubated with receptor-containing membrane for 30 min at 4 C.  Then 50 mM HEPES and the test compound are added and incubated at room temperature (shaking) for 2 hours. The beads are then spun down and counted using a scintillation counter.<br>
Evaluation of potency and duration of action in isolated guinea pig trachea<br>
Tracheae were removed from adult male Hartely guinea pigs (Charles River, Raleigh. NC; 400-600 grams) and placed into modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Compositifn of the solution was (mM): NaCl 113.0, KC1 4.8, CaCl2 2.5, KH2P04 1.2,<br>
MgSO4 1.2,NaHCO3 25.0 and dextrose 11.0. which was gassed with 95% 02: 5% CO2 and maintained at 37°C. Each trachea was cleaned of adherent tissve and opened<br>
lengthwise. Epithelium was removed by gently rubbing the luminai surface with a cotton-tipped applicator. Individual strips were cut, approximately 2 cartiîage rings in width3 and suspended via silk suture in 10-ml water-jacketed organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit solution and connected to Grass FT03C force-displacement. transducers Mechanical responses were recorded isometrically by MPlOOWS/Acknowledge data acquisition systern (BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA, wvvw.biopac.com) run on Apple G4 computers. The tissues were equilibrated undei 3 resting tension of 1.5 g, determined to be optimal by length-tension evaluaţi on, and washsd with Krebş-Henseleit solution every 15 minutes for one hour After the equilihr£.+.ion potiod pulmonary tissues were contracted with 10 uM carbachol untj! • reaohing pluteau, which served as a reference contraction for data aialysis. Tissues were then tţfifctd ev^y 15 minutes over l hour until reaching baseline torit. The preparations were theo left for at least 30 minutes before the start of the experiment.<br>
Concentration-response curves were obtained by a cumulative additioii of carbachol in half-log increments (Van Rossum, 1963, Arch. Int. Phaimacodyn,, 143:299), initiated at l nM. Each concentration was left in contact with the preparation until the "esponse plateaued before the addition of the subsequent carbachol concentration. Paired tissues were exposed to mAChR antagonist cornpounds or vehicle fqi 30 n,gi before carbachol cumulative concentration-respcnse cnn'es wtre generated, AII iată îs given as mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e m.) with n being . the nur-.^er of different animals.<br>
For superfusion (duration of action) studies, the tissues were ecntinuously ' superfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 2 ml/min for the duration of the experiment. Stock solutions of agonist and antagonist were infused (O 02 ml/min) vie 22,-guage needle inserted into the superfusion tubing. Mechanical responses were<br>
recordt H isometrically using a commercially-available data acquisitica system<br>
(MPlOOWS/Acknowledge; Bl OP AC Systems, Goleta, CA, www.biopac.com) interfaced with a Macintosh G4 computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA www.apple.com),',, The tissues were suspended under an optimal resting tension .of 1.5 g. ,After a 60 min equilibration period, the tissues were contracted with carbachol (l uM) for the duration ofthe experiment. Upon reaching a sustained contraction isoprotefenol (10 uM) was administered to maximally relax the tissue, and this change served as a reference. Isoproterenol exposure was halted and the carbachol-induced tension allowed to recover. Muscarinic receptor antagonists infused at a single concentration per tissue until a sustained level of inhibition was attained. The compound was then removed and, once again, the carbachol-induced tension was allowed to recover.<br>
The following parameters were determined for each concentration of antagonist, and expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. for n individual animals. Inhibition of the carbachol-induced contraction was expressed as a percent of the reference response (isoproterenol) and the time required to reach one-half of this relaxation was measured (onset of response). The tension recovery following removal of the compound was determined as was the time required to reach one-half of the maximum tension recovery (offset of response). At 60 and 180 minutes after removal of the antagonist the remaining level of inhibition was determined and expressed as a percent of the isoproterenol reference.<br>
Antagonist concentration-response curves were obtained by plotting the maximal relaxation data at O, 60 and 180-min following antagonist withdrawal. Recovery, termed shift, was calculated from the ratio of the 0-min inhibition curve IC5Q and the concentration of compound yielding a similar tension recovery at 60 and<br>
•l80 minutes.<br>
Halftimes for onset and offset of response were plotted vs. corresponding concentration and me data were fit with non-linear regression. These values were extrapolated at the IC50 (determined from the inhibition concentration-response curve)<br>
and designated Ot5Q (time required, at the IC5Q concentration, to reach half of the onset response) and Rt50 (time required, at the IC5Q concentration, to reach half of the recovery response).<br>
FQRMULATIQN-ADMINISTRATION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulaţion comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically funcţional derivative (e. g., salts and esters) thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
Hereinafter, the term "active ingredient" means a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically funcţional derivative thereof.<br>
Gompounds of formula (I) will be administered via inhalation via the mouth or nose.<br>
Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may, for example, be presented in capsules and cartridges of for example gelatine, or blisters of for example laminated aluminium foii, for use in an inhaler or insufflator. Powder blend formulations generally contain a powder mix for inhalation of the compound of the invention and a suitable powder base (carrier/diluent/excipient substance) such as mono-, di- or poly-saccharides (e.g., lactose or starch), organic or inorganic salts (e.g., calcium chloride, calcium phosphate or sodium chloride), polyalcohols (e.g., mannitol), or mixtures thereof, alternatively with one or more additional materials, such additives included in the blend formulation to improve chemical and/or physical stability or performance of the formulation, as discussed below, or mixtures thereof. Use of lactose is preferred. Each capsule or cartridge may generally contain between 20u,g-lOmg of the compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with another therapeutically active ingredient.  Alternatively, the compound of the invention may be presented without excipients, or may be formed into particles comprising the compound, optionally other therapeutically active materials, and excipient materials, such as by co-precipitation or coating.<br>
Suitably, the medicament dispenser is of a type selected from the group consisting of a reservoir dry powder inhaler (RDPI), a multi-dose dry powder inhaler (MDPI), and a metered dose inhaler (MDI).<br>
By reservoir dry powder inhaler (RDPI) it is meant as an inhaler having a reservoir form pack suitable for comprising multiple (un-metered doses) of medicament in dry powder form and including means for metering medicament do se from the reservoir to a delivery position. The metering means may for example comprise a metering cup or perforated plate, which is movable from a first position where the cup may be filled with medicament from the reservoir to a second position where the metered medicament dose is made available to the patient for inhalation.<br>
By multi-dose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) is meant an inhaler suitable for dispensing medicament in dry powder form, wherein the medicament is comprised within a multi-dose pack containing (or otherwise carrying) multiple, define doses (or parts thereof) of medicament. In a preferred aspect, the cartier has a blister pack form, but it could also, for example, comprise a capsule-based pack form or a carrier onto which medicament has been applied by any suitable process including printing, painting and vacuum occlusion.<br>
The formulation can be pre-metered (eg as in Diskus, see GB 2242134 or Diskhaler, see GB 2178965, 2129691 and 2169265) or metered in use (eg as in Turbuhaler, see EP 69715). An example of a unit-dose device is Rotahaler (see GB 2064336). The Diskus inhalation device comprises an elongate strip formed from a base sheet having a pluraliry of recesses spaced along its length and a lid sheet hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to define a plurality of containers, each container having therein an inhalable formulation containing a compound of formula (I) preferably combined with lactose. Preferably, the strip is sufficiently flexible to be wound into a roii. The lid sheet and base sheet will preferably have leading end portions which are not sealed to one another and at least one of the said leading end portions is constructed to be attached to a winding means. Also, preferably the hermetic seal between the base and lid sheets extends over their whole width. The lid sheet may preferably be peeled from the base sheet in a longitudinal direction from a first end of the said base sheet.<br>
In one aspect, the multi-dose pack is a blister pack comprising multiple blisters for containment of medicament in diy powder form. The blisters are typically arranged in regular fashion for ease of release of medicament therefrom.<br>
In one aspect, the multi-dose blister pack comprises plural blisters arranged in generally circular fashion on a disk-form blister pack. In another aspect, the multi-dose blister pack is elongate in form, for example comprising a strip or a tape.<br>
Preferably, the multi-dose blister pack is defmed between two members peelably secured to one another. US Patents Nos. 5,860,419, 5,873,360 and 5,590,645 describe medicament packs of this general type. In this aspect, the device is usually provided with an opening station comprising peeling means for peeling the members apart to access each medicament dose. Suitably, the device is adapted for use where the peelable members are elongate sheets which define a plurality of medicament containere spaced along the length thereof, the device being provided with indexing means for indexing each container in turn. More preferably, the device is adapted for use where one of the sheets is a base sheet having a plurality of pockets therein, and the other of the sheets is a Ud sheet, each pocket and the adjacent part of the lid sheet defining a respective one of the containers, the device comprising driving means for pulling the lid sheet and base sheet apart at the opening station.<br>
By metered dose inhaler (MDI) it is meant a medicament dispenser suitable for dispensing medicament in aerosol form, wherein the medicament is comprised in an aerosol container suitable for containing a propellant-based aerosol medicament formulation. The aerosol container is typically provided with a metering valve, for example a slide valve, for release of the aerosol form medicament formulation to the patient. The aerosol container is generally designed to deliver a predetermined dose of medicament upon each actuation by means of the valve, which can be opened eithef by depressing the valve while the container is held stationary or by depressing the container while the valve is held stationary.<br>
Spray compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may for example be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a metered dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Aerosol compositions suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain the compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with another therapeutically active ingredient and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofiuoroalkanes, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofiuoromethane,<br>
dichlorotetra-fluoroethane, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafiuoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. Carbon dioxide or other suitable gas may also be used as propellant. The aerosol composition may be excipient free or may optionally contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants eg oleic acid or lecithin and cosolvents eg ethanol. Pressurised formulations will generally be retained in a canister (eg an aluminiurn canister) closed with a valve (eg a metering valve) and fitted into an actuator provided with a mouthpiece.<br>
Medicaments for administration by inhalation desirably have a controlled partide size. The optimum aerodynamic partide size for inhalation into the bronchial system for localized delivery to the lung is usually l-lOpim, preferably 2-5pim. The optimum aerodynamic partide size for inhalation into the alveolar region for achieving systemic delivery to the lung is approximately .5-3 nm, preferably 1-3 |J,m. Particles having an aerodynamic size above 20[im are generally too large when inhaled to reach the small airways. Average aerodynamic partide size of a formulation may measured by, for example cascade impaction. Average geometric partide size may be measured, for example by laser diffraction, optical means.<br>
To achieve a desired partide size, the particles of the active ingredient as produced may be size reduced by convenţional means eg by controlled crystallization, micronisation or nanomilling .The desired fraction may be separated out by air classification. Alternatively, particles of the desired size may be directly produced, for example by spray drying, controlling the spray drying parameters to generate particles of the desired size range. Preferably, the particles will be crystalline, although amorphous material may also be employed where desirable. When an excipient such as lactose is employed, generally, the partide size of the excipient will be much greater than the inhaled medicament within the present invention, such that the "coarse" carrier is non-respirable. When the excipient is lactose it will typically be present as milled lactose, wherein not more than 85% of lactose particles will have a MMD of 60-90^m and not less than 15% will have a MMD of less than 15^m. Additive materials in a dry powder blend in addition to the carrier may be either respirable, i.e., aerodynamically less than 10 microns, or non-respirable, i.e., aerodynamically greater than 10 microns. Suitable additive materials which may be employed include arm'no acids, such as leucine; water soluble or water insoluble, natural or synthetic surfactants, such as<br>
lecithin (e.g., soya lecithin) and solid state fatty acids (e.g., lauric, palmitic, and stearic acids) and derivatives thereof (such as salts and esters); phosphatidylcholines; sugar esters. Additive materials may also include colorants, taste masking agents (e.g,, saccharine), anti-static-agents, lubricants (see, for example, Published PCT Patent Appl. No. WO 87/905213, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein), chemical stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, absorption enhancers, and other materials known to those of ordinary skill.<br>
Sustained release coating materials (e.g., stearic acid or polymers, e.g. polyvinyl pyrolidone, polylactic acid) may also be employed on active material or active material containing particles (see, for example, Patent Nos. US 3,634,582, GB 1,230,087, GB 1,381,872, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein).<br>
Intranasal sprays may be formulated with aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles \vith the addition of agents such as thickening agents, buffer salts or acid or alkali to adjust the pH, isotonicity adjusting agents or anti-oxidants.<br>
Solutions for inhalation by nebulation may be formulated with an aqueous vehicle with the addition of agents such as acid or alkali, buffer salts, isotonicity adjusting agents or antimicrobials. They may be sterilised by filtration or heating in an autoclave, or presented as a non-sterile product.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein before recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
Throughout the specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word 'comprise', and variations such as 'comprises' and 'comprising', will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers but not to the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.<br>
AII publications, including but not limited to patents and patent applications, cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.<br>
