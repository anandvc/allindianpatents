				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a bobbin holder in a winding device for winding a thread and more particularly to an increase in a speed and an enhancement in a durability of the bobbin holder.<br>
BACKKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, the number of threads wound on the bobbin holder of a winding device at the same time tends to be increased to 12 to 16 and the sum of the force of compressing means for pressing a chuck member that holds a bobbin is increased to 500 to 1500 kg. As described in JP-UM-A-60-43667, conventionally, a cylinder for applying pressure against compressing means for expanding a chuck member is provided on the attachment side of a bobbin holder when loosening the chuck member to release a bobbin.<br>
In the conventional art, in the case in which the chuck member is pushed in an axial direction by a cylinder for applying pressure against the compressing means for expanding the chuck member, a bearing for supporting the holder receives the pressing force through the holder.<br>
As in recent years, the number of threads wound at the same time over one bobbin holder is increased so that the sum of the forces of the compressing means is increased. Consequently, there is a problem in that the bearing receives a large thrust force by the pressing force, resulting in the generation of a pressure track on the rolling surface of<br><br>
the  bearing to  cause  a remarkable  reduction  in  the  lifetime  of the bearing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a bobbin holder comprising: a holder supported rotatably on a bearing; a chuck member which holds a bobbin and is expandable; compressing means for expanding the chuck member to hold the bobbin; a pushing member for pressing the compressing means when releasing and loosening the hold of the bobbin; and release means provided on an attachment portion side of the holder and serving to push the pushing member which are disposed on an outer periphery of the holder; wherein the bobbin holder further comprises the pull-up means for pressing the pushing member by the release means against the compressing means when loosening the chuck member, and for pulling the holder in a reverse direction to a pushing direction of the release means. Consequently, it is possible to solve problems in the background art.<br>
BRIEF DFSCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing a bobbin holder according to an example of the invention, illustrating a state in which a bobbin is held.<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing the bobbin holder according to the example of the invention, illustrating a state in which the bobbin in released.<br>
Fig. 3 is a detailed view showing a D portion in Fig. 1, illustrating the action and relationship of a force in the case in which the bobbin in a holding state is to be released.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An example of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing a state in which the inside diameter on a bobbin is held by a chuck member according to the example of the invention. Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a state in which the inside diameter of the bobbin is opened from the chuck member.<br>
In Fig. 1, a supporter 1 is protruded with a flange portion la fastened to a frame (not shown) with a bolt 24. Bearing 4 and 5 are engaged with a hollow portion lb of the supporter 1 and rotary shaft 2 is rotatably supported. A driving force transmitting member 14 and a driving shaft 15 are coupled to a right side of the rotary shaft 2 and a holder 6 is pressed into a left side through a protruded portion 3 of the rotary shaft 2, and chuck members 12a to 12h for holding the inside diameters of bobbins 13a to 13d are provided on the outer periphery of the holder 6.<br>
The chuck member is constituted by a circular taper member 9, a plurality of (six in the example) chuck pieces 8 divided onto a circumference, and a plurality of compression coil springs 25.<br>
The inside diameter of the taper member 9 is engaged with the outside diameter portion of the holder 6 and a taper portion 7 formed on an outer periphery is engaged with the inside diameter portion of the chuck piece 8.<br><br>
The compression spring is engaged with each of spring receivers 11a to llh which has one of ends engaged with a groove portion formed on the holder 6 and compresses the taper member 9 in an axial direction, thereby expanding the chuck piece 8 to be engaged with the taper member 9 in the direction of a normal and holding the inside diameters of the bobbins 13a to 13d.<br>
The chuck pieces 8 are engaged with a plurality of square holes formed on a cylindrical sleeve 10 provided coaxially with the holder respectively so that they can be expanded in the direction of the normal. While the sleeve 10 is integrally shown in the example, it may be divided into a plurality of portions in the axial direction for execution.<br>
A slot 10a formed on the sleeve 10 is engaged with the pin 14 fixed to one of the ends of the holder 6 and as provided in such a manner that the sleeve 10 is not rotated in a rotating direction but can be moved in the axial direction.<br>
A piston 17 is coaxially engaged with the bottom of the supporter 1 and one of ends thereof is fixed in the axial direction with a snap ring 23 fixed to the supporter 1. Moreover, a cylinder 16 is provided movably in the axial direction coaxially with the piston 17 and O rings 21 and 22 are provided on the engagement portion of the cylinder 16 and the piston 17 to constitute an air cylinder.<br>
A circular plate 18 is fixed to the cylinder with a snap ring 20. A compression spring 19 is provided between the piston 17 and the circular plate 18 coaxially with the supporter 1, and the cylinder 16 comes in close contact with the flange portion la formed on the bottom of the supporter 1 when compressed air is not supplied to an air supply port 16a of the cylinder 16.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 2, next, description will be given to a state in which the chuck member is opened from the inside diameter of the bobbin, that is, a time of release. When the compressed air is supplied from the air supply port 16a, the compression spring 19 is compressed so that the cylinder 16 is moved toward a left side away from the flange portion la in Fig. 2 and the piston 17 is moved toward a right side apart from the snap ring 23. Consequently, an end face 16b portion of the cylinder 16 abuts on an end 10b portion of the sleeve 10 to press the sleeve 10 in the axial direction.<br>
As a result, a portion 9a of the taper member 9 engaged with a groove portion 10c formed on the inside diameter of the sleeve 10 is pressed in the axial direction (a leftward direction in Fig. 2) to compress a compression coil spring 25 so that the chuck member 8 becomes free in the direction of a normal and the inside diameter of the bobbin is thus loosened. At this time, a flange portion 17a formed on the piston 17 abuts on a flange portion 6a of the holder 6 so that the holder 6 receives a pulling pressure in a reverse direction to a force for pressing the sleeve 10 in the axial direction through the cylinder 16. In other words, the holder 6 is pulled up by the piston 17.<br>
A relationship between the pressing force and the pulling pressure will be described in more detail with reference to Fig. 3. When the compressed air is fed in, the cylinder 16 abuts on the sleeve 10 so that a pressing force Fl applied from the cylinder acts on the sleeve 10.<br>
If the pull-up means, corresponding to the elements 17a or 6a according to the example of the invention is not provided, the pressing force Fl acts from the sleeve 10 to the taper member 9, from the taper member 9 to the compression coil spring 25, and subsequently, the spring receiver 11, the holder 6 and the protruded portion 3 of the rotary shaft, and finally, the inner ring of the bearing 4 receives the force Fl.<br><br>
For this reason, a thrust force acts on the bearing so that an early breakage or a reduction in a lifetime is caused.<br>
In the example, the cylinder is constituted by the cylinder 16 and the piston 17 and the pull-up means 17a and 6a are provided respectively. Even if the pressing force Fl acts on the holder 6, therefore, the pressing force Fl and a pulling pressure -Fl in a reverse direction act on the holder 6. Consequently, the mutual forces are offset so that the thrust force does not act on the bearing.<br>
When the compressed air is released from the air supply port 16a of the cylinder, the cylinder 16 is opened through the compression spring 19 so as to come in contact with the flange portion la and the snap ring 23 with which the piston 17 is fixed to the supporter 1.<br>
As a result, the sleeve 10 is opened and is thus moved toward the right side by means of the compression spring 19 and the taper member 9 is moved in a rightward direction so that the chuck piece 8 is expanded in the direction of the normal to hold the inside diameters of the bobbins 13a to 13d, and the state shown in Fig. 1 is thus brought so that the holder and the bobbins can be rotated integrally.<br>
While the chuck member is set to be the taper member in the example, the invention can also be applied to a member to be expanded by the compression of an elastic member or other well-known chuck members.<br>
While the driving source of the release means for pressing the holder at a time of release and the driving source of the pull-up means opposing the release means are set to be the compressed air and constitute the air cylinder integrally in common in the example, moreover, an oil pressure or other means may be used in addition to the<br><br>
compressed air for the driving source. While the driving sources of the release scans and the pull-up means are shared in the example, furthermore, it is also possible to employ such a structure as to use separate driving sources and to be operated interlockingly with each other respectively.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The invention can be applied to a bobbin holder in a winding device for<br>
winding a thread. According to the invention, when a bobbin is loosened, the pressing force acts on the holder 6 from the cylinder 16, and at the same time, the pulling pressure in the reverse direction to the pressing force acts on the holder 6 from the piston 17. Consequently, the thrust forces acting on the bearings 4 and 5 for supporting the rotary shaft 2 are offset. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage of the bearings and a reduction in a lifetime.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
