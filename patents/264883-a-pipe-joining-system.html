A NOVEL PIPE JOINING SYSTEM AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
Jain Irrigation Systems LimitedPlastic Park, NH. No.- 6, Bambhori, P.B.72, Jalgaon 42500,Maharashtra State, IndiaAn Indian company registered under the Companies Act, 1956<br>
The following Specification describes the invention:<br><br>
A NOVEL PIPE JOINING SYSTEM AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE<br>
SAME<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The invention generally relates to joints in pipe systems. In particular it relates to pipe systems based on gravitational flow, such as those used for sewage transport.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
A major problem which the sewage management bodies in major cities around the world face from time to time is the sewerage rehabilitation. Ageing sewage lines develop leakages, something which is of environmental and public health concern. Methods involving large excavations and trenching to repair aging sewage lines are not practical, particularly in urban areas, as it will potentially<br>
result in damage to roads and infrastructure, traffic hold ups, environmental pollution, and incur huge expenditure.<br>
Alternative methods of sewage rehabilitation are therefore sought world over.<br>
For man-entry sewers, particularly of noncircular shaped pipes, there are available a number of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) products and some Polyethylene products. These come as one piece or multi piece liners for insertion into existing sewers to be rehabilitated. In recent times, GRP has largely taken over from glass reinforced cement panels for this purpose. Ferro cement panels are also available which can be used as invert sections in conjunction with in situ spray method such as Gunite and Shot Crete.<br>
For sewers that are structurally sound but leak at the joints, proprietary mechanical sealing systems and chemical method for pressure grouting individual<br>
joints are available.<br><br>
Pipe bursting, which is a technique of sewerage rehabilitation, is undertaken widely, particularly in sewer upsizing operations. The Grundoburst hydraulic rod<br>
puller and static head are popularly used in this method. The Expandit system is used to work between manholes installing discrete pipes machined to length from polyethylene stock.<br>
Most piping systems are made from a number of pipes that are jointed together in field. The joints must be leak proof and able to withstand various forces acting on the system during its construction and operational life. Furthermore, the joints must be easy to construct in limited space available for such operations.<br>
The most commonly used pipe jointing methods available for polyethylene pipe are threading and welding.<br>
Threading is used to join together polyethylene pipes. Threads, which can be of any profile, are introduced on pipes in male and female format. Pipes are then fitted together by rotating the male and female ends into each other. Threaded joints made with proper quality control can be leak proof and withstand all kinds of forces. However, a major problem with threaded joints is that their construction requires large space and the process is time consuming.<br>
Welding is another method available for jointing polyethylene pipes. Two types of welding are commonly used, namely, butt welding or electro-fusion welding. As in case of the threaded joint, the welded joint made with proper quality control can be leak proof and withstand all kinds of forces. These joints also suffer from the same drawback as that of a threaded joint - one of space and construction time.<br>
Both the threading and welding processes require large space which is a crucial limitation for their application. Typical manhole diameter in sewerage systems varies from 1000mm to 1200mm. Rehabilitation operations with trenchless<br><br>
technologies typically involve insertion of pipes through the manholes. The pipes are normally laid at the bottom of the manholes leaving little working space for<br>
the jointing operation, which involves equipment including pipe holding clamps, pipe turning devices, heater plates etc.<br>
A further drawback of the existing systems, particularly those that use the welded joints, is the difficulty to exercise quality control. In case of the welded joints, the lack of quality control affects factors such as evenness of the temperature, proper contact between the heating plate and the surfaces to be joined, preparation of the surfaces to be jointed, among other things. This in turn affects the strength, integrity and longevity of the joints.<br>
There is therefore a need to provide a system of joints that will withstand the imposed forces, be of better quality, leak proof, quick and easy to construct, and require lesser space to carry out the jointing operation than the existing systems.<br>
Objects and advantages:<br>
Accordingly, the objects and advantages of the present invention are as described below.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a joint that:<br>
-	is able to withstand the dragging &amp; pulling forces acting on pipe during a rehabilitation operation and the operational life.<br>
-	is leak proof<br>
-    is easy to install in field<br>
-	requires the minimum space for installation<br>
-	is installed in short span of time<br>
-	is cost effective.<br><br>
Brief Description of Figures:<br>

female ends of the pipe.<br>

Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides a novel pipe joint for use in pipe systems carrying fluid under gravity and the method of making the same. The joint is based on a snap-fit principle whereby two pipes whose ends are specially profiled are snap-fitted together by application of axial force. Sealing rings are used to make the joint leak-proof. Male and female ends are provided with special profiles such that the joint sustains the longitudinal forces imposed on the joint during its construction and operational life. The joint is simple in its construct, easy to assemble in field and cost effective. The invention also disclosed a method of making snap fit joints for use in pipe systems carrying fluid under gravity.<br>

Detailed description of the present invention:<br>
The present invention describes a novel joint for pipes carrying fluids that flow under gravity. The invention provides a leak-proof joint that is particularly suitable where the pipe system has to withstand the axial dragging &amp; pulling forces that are exerted on the joints during their construction as well as the operational life.<br>
The most preferred embodiment of the invention is now described.<br>
Figure 1 shows two pipes to be jointed by the method of the present invention. One end of a pipe is provided with a male profile on its external surface. A corresponding or matching female profile is provided on the internal surface at one end of the other pipe to be jointed. However, such arrangement will not withstand any forces and the joint will soon come undone under field situations if proper interference is not provided. A novel sealing and locking arrangement that will withstand longitudinal forces is disclosed in the present invention. The arrangement comprises provision of sealing rings to prevent fluid leakage.<br>
A novel feature of the present invention is the profiles provided at the pipe ends. The profiles are designed in such a way that these help in easy assembly but are difficult to dismantle. This is achieved through the engineering design of the profile shape.<br>
Another advantageous feature of the present invention is that the ease with which quality control can be exercised during field operations. The design of the joint is such that the joint making equipment is simple obviating the need for complex field operations. This makes application of required field quality control relatively easy in comparison with the existing systems.<br><br>
As a further novel feature of the present invention, a sealing ring 5 is placed inside the sealing ring groove 4 that is made at the end of male end of the pipe and this sealing ring is locked by ring seat 6 provided at the entrance of female end.<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal cross section of the pipe 1 taken at the male end profile 2. In order that the sealing ring provided at the end does not get displaced from its position during assembly, a ring stopper 7 is provided. An entry length 8 at the start of male end is provided for ease of insertion. The provision of entry length helps to ensure that the male/female profiles do not suffer damage during the joint construction.<br>
Figure 3 shows a longitudinal cross section through the female end showing relative positions of the seat for sealing ring 6, female profile 3, engagement clear length 9, and chamfer 10 provided for easy entry of ring seat over the sealing<br>
ring.<br>
Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional view taken through the sealing ring inside the assembled joint showing the male and female end of pipe<br>
Figure 5 shows the cross-sectional view taken through the locking position of male and female profile.<br>
The present invention also discloses a method to make snap fit joints in pipe systems carrying fluid under gravity. End of one of the pipes to be jointed is given a special profile (male profile) on its outer surface and the inner surface of the other pipe to be joined is given a matching profile (female profile). Pipes are laid in position in situ. A sealing ring is provided on the pile with<br><br>
Operation of the invention:<br>
To construct the joint in field conditions, the pipes to be jointed are taken to the<br>
location of their laying. A sealing ring is placed in its groove at the male end of the pipe. Male and female ends are then situated so that the entry length provided at male end sits inside the entry length provided on female end. Pipes are then snap-fitted. The resultant joint is resistant to dragging and pulling forces that will be exerted during the construction of the joints themselves and construction of the rehabilitated sewage line where such jointing operation is required. The joints and the resulting sewage line are leak-proof. Such joints require considerably lesser space and time for jointing than the conventional joints for similar operations.<br>
Several embodiments of the present invention are possible. In one embodiment, a plurality of special profiles is provided at the male end of the pipes. Corresponding profiles are provided on the female end of the pipe.<br>
In another embodiment, a plurality of sealing rings or change in the seating of sealing rings is provided. Corresponding changes are provided on other end of the pipe and this joint could be used for pressure application pipe lines.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a change in the profile provided for interlocking at the male and female ends of the pipe can be made to fit the purpose.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a change in the sealing ring profile provided for sealing purpose can be made to fit the purpose.<br>
In yet another embodiment the material used for the pipes is any material selected from a group comprising metals, alloys, wood, rubber, or any combination thereof.<br><br>
It is evident that the present invention has several advantages over the existing<br>
pipe jointing methods and systems. The joint is assembled on field with great<br>
ease. As the materials are light weight and the components simple in their structure, the operation is straightforward. As both male and female ends are provided with special profiles and entry lengths, the joint can be carried out with<br>
relative ease even under difficult conditions such as insufficient light or wet and slippery surroundings. A still further advantage of the jointing system of the present invention is that quality control can be easily exercised during its construction. A further advantage of the joint described in the present invention is that it is leak-proof and also resistant to the drag &amp; pulling force.<br>
