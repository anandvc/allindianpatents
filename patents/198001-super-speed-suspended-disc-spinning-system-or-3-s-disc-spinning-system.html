Coinuarison of conventional! spinnihg &amp; Super Speed Suspended Disc Spinning system : The conventional method of inserting twist on to the yarn and winding the same on the bobbin has been done simultaneously. This operation has been done by the spindle, ring and traveler combination. The spindle rotates at a higher revolution per minute (between 15,000 to 22,000 rpm), depending on the condition of spinning frame and also the cotton quality. Also the front-roller speed of the spinning frame has been increased slowly with increase in roller diameter resiulting in the higher load factor on the gearing end.<br>
The twist per inch (tpi) is decided by the spindle rpm and the delivery speed of the front roller of the spinning frame. Actually the traveler determines the twist under some critical conditions. The traveler shape &amp; weight and the ring profile restricts the speed to a limit beyond which the yarn gets more breakage due to ballooning and tension created while winding on the bobbin. The distance between the nip of the front roller to the traveler is now more than about 380-mm and from the lappet-eye to the traveler is more than about 250-mm. Under such circumstances, when the speed of spindle increases further, then the tension gets increased resulting in more end breakage. This would also affect the evenness of the yarn qualify. In the modern high speed ring frames much research has been done to reduce the tension by reducing the ring diameter to less than 40-mm, thereby reduce the diameter of full cop to minimise the tension on the yarn.<br>
The conventional high speed ring spinning frames are designed to get the drive for all the spindles from the TR-Pulleys fitted on a common shaft. This shaft gets the drive from the main gearing head-stock directly. All the conventional ring-spinning frames consume power about 90% of the total power consumed in a textile spinning mill. Out of this, TR-Pulleys and spindles consume more than 50% of a ring-spinning frame. Still the modern high speed ring frame (with spindle speed about22,000-rpm) are consuming still higher power. This increases the production cost.<br>
When all the components are subjected to get higher speed, the maintenance cost also goes higher, particularly the spindles, rings and traveler. The load on the main motor is increased when the speed of the spindles (rpm) is subjected to higher rpm. This results ultimately in the wear &amp; tear of all rotating components. Also the heat generated is more and due to that better grade lubricants are required for maintenance resulting higher cost.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a technological break-through in the method of spinning or inserting the twist on to the yarn in the ring and doubling(Twisting) frames followed by the winding of the same on bobbin. These problems have been studied at length for few years and after that the research was carried out to change the twisting component design completely. It was then decided to separate the twisting area from the existing ring &amp; traveler combination to an area nearer to the front-roller nip so that the much spoken tension on yarn could be reduced leaving still with higher production. Then the following inventions are made carefully keeping in mind the increase in production, quality, power saving, reduce maintenance cost, etc, without involving much of additional cost in converting the existing old spinning frames to higher production machines.<br>
Apart from spinning the yarn by means of the Disc Spinning System, the tight winding of the same on the bobbin has been done by reducing the spindle speed to about 300-rpm or slightly higher than the delivery speed (surface speed) of the front roller. The actual twist takes place in between the yarn tensioner and the lappet-eye placed above the Disc Spinning System. The yarn tensioner is adjustable as per the requirement of tension for different counts of yarn. The drive for the spindle is taken from the front roller end pinion and through the common tangential belt drive for all the spindles eliminating completely the tin-roller drive. This ensures the saving of power to more than about 30% despite increase in the speed of the Disc Spinning Svstem.<br>
Brief description of the Super Speed Suspended Disc Spinning System as it has been<br>
shown in the following figures :<br>
Fig 1 &amp; 2: The Super Speed Suspended Spinning Disc and the related driving<br>
components are mentioned and notified in the elevation and plan views.<br>
Fig 3: The driving mechanism from the Front-roller to the main Disc Spinning<br>
System and the drive to the spindle are shown in the elevation view.<br>
Fig 4: The critical mechanism and the parts of the Disc Spinning system are clearly<br>
indicated in three different sectional views i.e, in plan view &amp; in two end views<br><br>
Reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate the ir^^ention in greater detail. The sectional view shown in the Fig^l is the complete assembly of the 3-S Disc Spinning System. The bottom L-r,haped bracket (BRl) is made of mild steel plate having the thickness of 7mm, the length 80-mm and the width 60mm. The distance from the center of the ball bearing (BB2) fixed on the bracket (BRl) from the face of the roller stand beam (RB) is 34mm. This position of the bearing would be varying for certain make of the ring spinning frame and also depending on the distance between the center of the spindle top to the roller stand beam (RB). Based on this position, the other roller components are fixed.<br>
The driving disc-pulley (DP) is fixed on the shaft (SI). This pulley is the main driving pulley for the complete 3-S Disc assembly, getting the drive from the motor cone-pulley (B) or from the front roller end pinion (FEP). The drive is transferred through a set of either bevel gears (BV3 &amp; BV4) in Fig-3 or even from a separate motor of a lower capacity. All the disc-pulleys (DP) in the Disc Spinning System would be driven by means of an endless tangential belt having a width of 15mm X 2 mm thickness (TB). The belt is given enough tension by means of adjustable tensioning device provided in the frame (TP ).<br>
The bracket (BRl) and one part of the other bracket (BR2) are inter connected so that the same could be adjusted whenever necessary. But this position when fixed for a particular frame should not be disturbed. The other part of the bracket (BR2) is fixed with a ball bearing (BBl) which again positioned to shaft (SI) with 8mm diameter. On the top of the shaft SI, a hard-rubber roller with shore hardness of above 85 with a diameter of 32mm is fixed for driving the shafts (S2) with 8mm diameter. There are two shafts (S2) with the bottom fixed on the bracket (BR2). The bottom of these two shafts are again fixed on the ball bearings (BBl) to run smoothly. The 32mm/34 mm dia roller drives the 8mm shafts so that the speed could be increased 4 times or more.<br>
The second bracket (BR2) is also inter-connected to the bracket (BR3) and also adjustable by means of a screw (S). This adjustment is absolutely necessary because after some time of working there may be some chances of slippage or to change the parts whenever necessary against wear &amp; tear. If there is any slippage due to less contact then the required speed may not be obtained. Therefore for increasing the<br><br>
contact pressure, the brackets are designed for adjustment. The top of the shafts (S2) arc fitted with a hard rubber rollers (R2) having hardness more than 85. These two shafts arc again positioned on the bracket (BR3) through the ball bearings (BB2). The two shafts (S2) along with the top driving rubber rollers (R2) are positioned in contact with the shaft (S3) with 8mm diameter (Fig J &amp; 2). The two shafts are driven 4-times faster than the shaft (SI).<br>
The shaft (S3) with 8mm diameter is fitted on the bracket (BR4) through the ball bearing (BB2). The top of the shaft (S3) is fitted with a hard rubber roller (hardness more than 85) having a diameter of 30mm X 6mm thickness (R3). This rubber roller fitted on shaft S3 rotates at a speed 12 times faster than the disc-pulley (DP). The roller (R3) after taking the drive from the two rollers (R2) through the shaft (S3), drives the specially designed Suspended Disc having 20mm diameter at 18 times faster than the disc-pulley (DP). This means that the final rpm of the Disc would be 18 times faster. Assuming that the rpm of the motor is 1400, then the spinning disc rpm would be 18 X 1400 rpm = 25,200-rpm. The whole disc (D in Fig 1&amp;2) is suspended between the two ball bearings (BBl) and the driving rubber roller (R3). The two ball bearings holding the Disc are adjustable so that the Disc is firmly held without any slippage. The twisted yarn passes through the slot (H in Fig 1&amp;2 and No:5 in Fig4) of the spinning disc of 20-mm dia (Fig 1) and gets wound on to the spindle through yarn guide (YG) and tensioner (YT).<br>
The bracket (BR4) is fully adjustable back &amp; forth and also could be opened up in the front in order to clean after few days of its working (FJg.l). This area is a vital area where the rollers are subjected to maximum speed. Only two brackets (BR3 and BR4) are fastened to the main bracket (SBR) which again is fixed on to the roller stand beam (RB). The other bracket (BR 3) is connected to one part of the bracket (BR2) at the front by means of a link-bracket (LB). This facilitates to adjust the shafts (S2) forward &amp; backward so that the shafts &amp; rollers get required pressure to get correct speed without any slippage. The bearing-shafts (SI, S2 &amp; S3) are fitted on the brackets and locked by means of circlips. This would prevent any shifting of position in either direction. Also the bearing-caps (BC in Fig-1) are provided on the top and bottom area of all the brackets. This would arrest the movement of the whole bearing either towards up or down.<br><br>
A compact aluminum or mild steel sheet outer cover covers the whole assembly of this Disc Spinning System. Each assembly unit could be fitted within the spindle gauge of 66-mm to 70-mm. As for as the drive to the main spindle is concerned, the pulley (Tl) fitted on to the front-roller (FR in Fig-1) transfers the drive through the belt connected to the pulley (T2). The drive then goes to the pulley (PI) through the bevel gears (BVl &amp; BV2). The surface speed of the bobbin fitted on the spindle (rpm of spindle) is maintained the same as that of the front roller (FR) delivery speed. This means that the delivery speed matches with the winding speed and thus makes sure the tight winding of the yarn on the bobbin. In the normal course during the conventional spinning method, the spindle rotates at 16,000 to 22,000-rpm and the traveler due to its own weight dragged through the ring along the direction of the spindle and adjusts itself to match the winding speed so that the adequate tension is maintained. The same principle is followed in il^c ?S-Disc Spinning System, but at a very low rpm of spindle. Also the required tension is maintained by means of a mechanical tei.sioning device in addition to the traveler pull so that a tight cop is ensured.<br>
The delivery speed of the front-roller (FR) with a diameter of 25 mm to 30 mm is variable depending on the required twist per inch (tpi) and the maximum speed in all the new frames is about 250-rpm. The spindle (SP) speed is so adjusted to run just more than 250-rpm to a maximum of 300-rpm to get slightly more surface speed than the front roller delivery speed. This means that it would give enough tension to the yarn for getting it wound on to the bobbin.<br>
The main twisting disc comprises of a special unique design made of two halves i.e, outside disc marked (No:2) and the inside disc marked (No:3) as shown in the Fig-4 having vertical slots (No: 5) on the opposite sides to allow the yarn to pass through. These slots are made with an angle so that while the disc rotates even at high rpm, at the time of 'piecing', allows the yarn (No.l) smoothly to enter through the slot and reach the steel ball area. Two steel balls (No:4) are placed on either side of a coil spring (for counter balancing) in the horizontal groove (No:8) drilled at the center from one end to the other end of the inside disc( No: 3) so that the yarn would get a gentle pressure in between the steel ball and the inside wall of the outside disc (No:2) due to the centrifugal force exerted on the steel ball while running at high rpm. Actually this is the area where the actual grip is given to the yarn thereby<br><br>
creating enough friction while twisting operation is carried out If the yarn count is very coarse such as lO's to 20's, then a coil spring with more number of coils (No: 6) helps to give a constant pressure to the steel ball so that adequate friction develops for the yarn to get the twist while the disc rotates at high rpm. The two discs are fastened by means of two screws (No:7).<br>
The spinning Disc is suspended between the main driving roller (R3) and two supporting ball bearing rollers (BBl). The whole disc is made out of very special steel alloy metal and duly finished with hard-chrome. This was developed to have this dimension after many years of conducting lot of trials. In this process of spinning / doubling the yarn, the suspended type of rotating disc driven by friction is an unique design by itself and a technological break-through. The other type of disc assembly designed for a direct pneumatic drive comprising two main flanges (No: 10 &amp; 11 in Fig-4) with a slot (18) provided for the yarn passage and fitted with a hook (12) at the center. The flanges are supported by means of Teflon coated or Ceramic balls or hardened steel balls (13) and suspended on the main bracket (16). This will ensure a smooth running of disc assembly. The impeller (9) is fitted in between the flanges and fastened to the two flanges by means of two screws (14), The impeller is given a drive by means of pneumatic pressure from a compressor through a nozzle provided on either side (17), The speed of the disc is controlled by the velocity of air pressure which is adjusted by a regulator. The hook (12) rotates at the center carrying the yarn (15) at the same rpm of the<br><br><br><br><br>
