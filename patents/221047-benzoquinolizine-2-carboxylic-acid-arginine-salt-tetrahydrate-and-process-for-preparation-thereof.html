Our U.S. patent 6,664,267 describes a crystalline monohydrate form of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i.j]<br>
          quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt that is disclosed as having advantages over the anhydrate and hydrate forms described in US 6,514,986 B2. Such advantageous properties for the crystalline monohydrate form, in comparison to the less crystalline anhydrate and hydrate forms, include enhanced stability at specified conditions of humidity and temperature.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-         hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic    acid        L-arginine salt tetrahydrate in highly homogeneous form is advantageous over previously known . forms and may be usable to prepare stable pharmaceutical dosage forms, including an aqueous<br><br><br>
solution, because it is the most physically stable form and does not have a tendency over time to convert to other crystalline forms.<br>

In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a crystalline S-(-)-9-fiuoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate which is highly homogeneous in regard to other solvatomorphic forms thereof and has superior properties in comparison to such other anhydrate or hydrate solvatomorphic noncrystalline or crystalline forms.<br>
The present invention further pertains to processes for the preparation of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate, pharmaceutical compositions containing it, and the use thereof in the treatment and/or prevention of a wide variety of microbial infections.<br>
The S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo-lH,5H-benzo [i,j] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate of the invention is a compound that shows potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria, as described in more detail below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a novel highly homogeneous<br>
crystalline tetrahydrate hydratomorphic form of the broad spectrum antibiotic S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-<br>
dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,	5H-benzo[ij]	quinolizine-2-<br>
carboxylic acid L-arginine salt, represented by the following structure:<br><br><br><br><br>
S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dmydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt has been shown in mammals to be effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, more particularly glycopeptide-resistant staphylococci, and to possess       excellent overall tolerability. (Posters F-535, F-537, F-538, F-539, and F-540 presented at 41st ICAAC 2001, Chicago, IL, USA and Poster F-564 presented at 42nd ICAAC 2002, San Diego, CA, USA).<br>
Initial methods to prepare S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt as a bulk active ingredient<br>
       resulted in an anhydrate solvatomorphic form and a hydrated solvatomorphic form thereof. The physicochemical characteristics of these solvatomorphs are described in U. S. Patent No. 6,514,986 B2. Solvatomorphism is said to exist when a molecule displays an ability to crystallize in different structures that in turn differ in their solvation state (Brittain, Spectroscopy, (2000), 15 (7), 34-39). A hydratomorph may be defined as a solvatomorph in<br>
         which the solvent is water. Further investigation in the preparation of bulk material revealed that a crystalline form could be produced of a monohydrate of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo- lH,5H-benzo[i j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt. The physicochemical characteristics are described in our U.S. patent 6,664,267. Further investigation of processes to prepare this monohydrate and single crystals of it led to a<br>
       hydratomorph which on X-ray crystallographic analysis showed it, surprisingly, to be a tetrahydrate, the detailed data for which is provided below and in the illustrations. An in-depth study of the different hydrates of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt in respect of their respective x-ray diffractograms, differential scanning calorimetry graphs, their water content,<br>
       their stability order as a function of temperature and/or humidity led to an understanding that the tetrahydrate is the most stable polymorph.<br>
S-(-)-9-Fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4"hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo-1 H,5H-benzo [i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate is further characterized by crystal parameters from single crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis as set forth below.<br><br><br>
The crystal of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt is found to form a molecular assembly having a composition of C19H21N2O4F.C6H14N4O2.4H2O; a 1:1 complex of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidh&gt; 1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo-1 H,5H-benzo[i j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic     acid and L-arginine with four water molecules of crystallization. The salt exists in the zwitterionic form in the orthorhombic system, space group P2i2i2i. The details of data collection, structure solution and refinement are given in Table 1.<br>

      The -COOH groups of both S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid and L-arginine are found ionized as -COO" and H+. These H+ ions are taken up by the nitrogen lone pairs of L-arginine to form NH3+ and NH2+ respectively. The four water molecules were found to form strong hydrogen bonds with the -COO" groups (Fig.2). In fact, H71 of one of the water molecules forms a strong 0-H...0<br>
        hydrogen bond with the -COO" group (H71.. .02 in Fig.2) of the benzoquinolizine-2-carboxylic acid, along with yet another strong O...H-N hydrogen bond with -NH3+ group of L-arginine (07...H31 in Fig.2). Thus, this water molecule (07) bridges the two moieties resulting in a stronger association. However, the other three water molecules, two of which generate a strong 0-H...0 hydrogen bonds with the -COO" group of L-arginine (O9H01.. .05 and O10H102.. .06),<br>
     and the remaining water molecule with -COO" of the benquinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (08H81...02), are less tightly bound, all bindings being shown in Fig.2. A Differential Scanning Calorimetric study (cf. Fig. 5) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (cf. Fig. 6) of the salt<br><br><br><br><br>
of the invention confirms the nature of binding, by three of the four water molecules (08, 09 and 010) being lost on heating at 70 °C, initially generating a monohydrate by retaining 07.<br>
Crystalline S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-1H, 5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate with the water molecules bound as depicted by the single crystal x-ray analysis may be prepared in high homogeneity by the slow evaporation of the solution made by dissolving S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo [ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt in an organic solvent and water.<br>
A process for the manufacture of the crystalline form of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyH-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate comprises the following consecutive steps:<br><br>
	a)  heating a suspension of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-<br>
methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt in an organic solvent and water at 70-80°C to obtain a clear solution;<br>
b)	cooling the solution to provide a crystalline substance;<br>
c)	isolating      the      crystalline      form      of      S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-                                       hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-<br>
carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate at 30°C - 35°C by filtration or centrifugation; and<br>
d)	air   drying   of   the       crystalline   form   of   S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-<br>
hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-<br>
 	carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate at a temperature between 30°C -<br>
35°C.<br>
Any S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-1 -oxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt can be used in step a). <br><br><br>
The preferred organic solvents are acetonitrile and acetone. The most preferred organic solvent is acetone. The preferred ratio of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt to the organic solvent to water is 1:5: 1.25 (w/v/v). The preferred ratio of acetone or acetonitrile to water is (4:1 v/v). <br>
The solution of step a) is heated for as long as necessary to obtain a clear solution. A clear solution is typically obtained in 15 minutes to 3 hours but the time may vary.<br>
In step b) the solution may be cooled to room temperature or between 30°C-35°C.<br>
         Of the various crystalline forms of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1 -yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt, the primary one that crystallizes directly from aqueous acetone solutions is the tetrahydrate. This tetrahydrate shows on Karl Fischer (KF) analysis a water content of 11.87 %, (calculated for 4H20: 11.88%), equivalent to four molecules of water of hydration. On further drying for 16 hrs at 70 °C and<br>
          under high vacuum of 1 mm of Hg the tetrahydrate is converted to a monohydrate and analyses for a water content of 4.0 %, (calculated for 1 H20: 3.98%).<br>
This monohydrate is highly unstable and rapidly absorbs moisture under ambient conditions of temperature (35 °C) and relative humidity (60 %). Within 20 minutes the XRPD spectra of the monohydrate undergoes changes as illustrated by the diffractograms in Figure 4, wherein the<br>
         characteristic 2 0 peaks of the monohydrate appearing at 5.28 and 10.66 in Figure 4-A shift to a reduction of the intensity of these peaks in Figure 4-B with a concomitant appearance of peaks at 2 9 values of 4.84 and 39.2 which are characteristic of the tetrahydrate.   In Figure 4-C the total disappearance is seen of the peaks of the monohydrate. Its conversion to the tetrahydrate may be confirmed by the increase in the intensity of the 2 9 peaks at 4.84 and 39.42, peaks which<br>
          overlap with those in Figure 3 obtained for an authentic sample of the tetrahydrate.<br>
The high homogeneity of the prepared tetrahydrate may be confirmed by comparison of its XRPD spectrum (Fig.3) with that obtained theoretically for single phase tetrahydrate material (Fig. 7) by inserting the coordinates derived from a single crystal X-ray structure into a standard software programme. The XRPD spectrum in Fig.3 is seen to be identical with that provided in                            Fig. 7.<br><br><br>
The water content of the tetrahydrate may range from 11.0 to 12.5% according to the Karl Fischer analysis.<br>
This novel crystalline form of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-       1 -oxo-lH,5H-benzo[i j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt of this invention is stable under typical storage conditions, has good bioavailability in mammals, has lower phlebitis-forming potential on administration to mammals, has low or reduced toxicity, has acceptable disintegration and dissolution rates, and hence is very useful for pharmaceutical manufacturing and for use in medicine. Formulation of the thermodynamically most stable form is a reasonable<br>
         expectation for a solution mediated process. Using the most stable form rather than a metastable form is advantageous regarding physical stability of the crystalline form. The increased physical stability will afford additional advantages in formulation. The form is specially suitable for treating diseases caused by microbial infections. The form is suitable for long-term intravenous therapy in critically ill patients or patients in intensive care units. Injectable preparations of the<br>
          L-arginine salt can be readily prepared in view of its availability in a bulk form that remains stable under specified conditions, its favorable aqueous solubility, its ideal suitability in not causing venous inflammation on repeated intravenous administration, and its safety from adverse toxicity.<br>
       The antibacterial polymorphic compound of the invention is useful in the treatment of mammals having a broad spectrum of bacterial infections such as impetigo, pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, endocarditis, urinary tract infections, gastro-intestinal infections and bacteremias caused by Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, methicillin-resitant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resitant coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococci, beta-<br>
        haemolytic streptococci, viridans group of streptococci, mycobacterial infections due to multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis and other atypical mycobacteria such as M. intracellulare and M. avium, as well as newly emerging Gram-negative pathogens such as Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Chryseobacterium indologense and other Gram-negative pathogens such as E.coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Pseudomonas.<br>
The present invention also encompasses an antiinfective composition for the treatment of humans and animals in need of prophylaxis and/or therapy for systemic or topical infections especially resistant gram-positive organism infections, gram-negative organism infections, mycobacterial infections and nosocomial pathogen infections, which composition comprises an amount of the        compound of the invention substantially sufficient to eradicate said infection, but not to cause any undue side effects. The compound and compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and animals who are at risk of being infected, for example a compound or composition of this invention can be administered to a patient prior to and/or after surgery, health care workers or others who are at risk of being infected.<br><br>
These findings have an important implication from the point of view of the systemic use of the compound of the invention in view of its superior potency, superior bactericidal activity, expanded biospectrum, better bioavailability and improved tolerability which are now enabled to be administered systemically in therapeutically effective doses. Utilizing the compound of the<br>
         invention, whether in systemic or topical dosage form, results in clearer dose-related definitions of efficacy, diminished toxic effects and accordingly an improved therapeutic index.<br>
The present invention encompasses the compound of administering the compounds to a human or other animal subject. The compound and compositions to be used in the invention must,           accordingly, be pharmaceutically acceptable. As used herein, such a "pharmaceutically acceptable" component is one that is suitable for use with humans and / or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
          The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared according to conventional procedures used by persons skilled in the art to make stable and effective compositions. Such methods include combining the tetrahydrate of this invention with suitable a carrier, diluent, solvent or excipient. In the solid, liquid, parenteral and topical dosage forms, an effective amount of the active compound or the active ingredient is any amount, which produces the desired results.<br><br><br>
It has been found in accordance with the present invention that the advantageous stability and solubility properties of the tetrahydrate of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl)-5-methyl-l-oxo-lH,5H-benzo[ij] quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt can be applied to the formulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms.
