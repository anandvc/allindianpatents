No. 60/893,217 entitled "WORD LINE TRANSISTOR STRENGTH CONTROL FOR READ AND WRITE IN SPIN TRANSFER TORQUE MAGNETORESISTIVE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY" filed March 6, 2007, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
<br>
Field of Disclosure<br>
<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the invention are related to random access memory (RAM).<br>
<br>
More particularly, embodiments of the invention are related to word line transistor voltage control in Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).<br>
<br>
Background<br>
<br>
[0003] Random access memory (RAM) is a ubiquitous component of modern digital architectures. RAM can be stand alone devices or can be integrated or embedded within devices that use the RAM, such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), system-on-chip (SoC), and other like devices as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. RAM can be volatile or non-volatile. Volatile RAM loses its stored information whenever power is removed. Non-volatile RAM can maintain its memory contents even when power is removed from the memory. Although non-volatile RAM has advantages in the ability to maintain its contents without having power applied, conventional non-volatile RAM has slower read / write times than volatile RAM.<br>
<br>
[0004] Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a non-volatile memory technology that has response (read / write) times comparable to volatile memory. In contrast to conventional RAM technologies which store data as electric charges or current flows, MRAM uses magnetic elements. As illustrated in Figs IA and IB, a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) storage element 100 can be formed from two magnetic <br>
<br>
layers 110 and 130, each of which can hold a magnetic field, separated by an insulating (tunnel barrier) layer 120. One of the two layers (e.g., fixed layer 110), is set to a particular polarity. The other layer's (e.g., free layer 130) polarity 132 is free to change to match that of an external field that can be applied. A change in the polarity 132 of the free layer 130 will change the resistance of the MTJ storage element 100. For example, when the polarities are aligned, Fig. IA, a low resistance state exists. When the polarities are not aligned, Fig. IB, then a high resistance state exists. The illustration of MTJ 100 has been simplified and those skilled in the art will appreciate that each layer illustrated may comprise one or more layers of materials, as is known in the art.<br>
<br>
[0005] Referring to Fig. 2A, a memory cell 200 of a conventional MRAM is illustrated for a read operation. The cell 200 includes a transistor 210, bit line 220, digit line 230 and word line 240. The cell 200 can be read by measuring the electrical resistance of the MTJ 100. For example, a particular MTJ 100 can be selected by activating an associated transistor 210, which can switch current from a bit line 220 through the MTJ 100. Due to the tunnel magnetoresistive effect, the electrical resistance of the MTJ 100 changes based on the orientation of the polarities in the two magnetic layers (e.g., 110, 130), as discussed above. The resistance inside any particular MTJ 100 can be determined from the current, resulting from the polarity of the free layer. Conventionally, if the fixed layer 110 and free layer 130 have the same polarity, the resistance is low and a "0" is read. If the fixed layer 110 and free layer 130 have opposite polarity, the resistance is higher and a " 1 " is read.<br>
<br>
[0006] Referring to Fig. 2B, the memory cell 200 of a conventional MRAM is illustrated for a write operation. The write operation of the MRAM is a magnetic operation. Accordingly, transistor 210 is off during the write operation. Current is propagated through the bit line 220 and digit line 230 to establish magnetic fields 250 and 260 that can affect the polarity of the free layer of the MTJ 100 and consequently the logic state of the cell 200. Accordingly, data can be written to and stored in the MTJ 100.<br>
<br>
[0007] MRAM has several desirable characteristics that make it a candidate for a universal memory, such as high speed, high density (i.e., small bitcell size), low power consumption, and no degradation over time. However, MRAM has scalability issues. Specifically, as the bit cells become smaller, the magnetic fields used for switching the <br>
<br>
memory state increase. Accordingly, current density and power consumption increase to provide the higher magnetic fields, thus limiting the scalability of the MRAM.<br>
<br>
[0008] Unlike conventional MRAM, Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random<br>
<br>
Access Memory (STT-MRAM) uses electrons that become spin-polarized as the electrons pass through a thin film (spin filter). STT-MRAM is also known as Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), Spin Torque Transfer Magnetization Switching RAM (Spin-RAM), and Spin Momentum Transfer (SMT-RAM). During the write operation, the spin-polarized electrons exert a torque on the free layer, which can switch the polarity of the free layer. The read operation is similar to conventional MRAM in that a current is used to detect the resistance / logic state of the MTJ storage element, as discussed in the foregoing. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, a STT-MRAM bit cell 300 includes MTJ 305, transistor 310, bit line 320 and word line 330. The transistor 310 is switched on for both read and write operations to allow current to flow through the MTJ 305, so that the logic state can be read or written.<br>
<br>
[0009] Referring to Fig. 3B, a more detailed diagram of a STT-MRAM cell 301 is illustrated, for further discussion of the read / write operations. In addition to the previously discussed elements such as MTJ 305, transistor 310, bit line 320 and word line 330, a source line 340, sense amplifier 350, read / write circuitry 360 and bit line reference 370 are illustrated. As discussed above, the write operation in an STT- MRAM is electrical. Read / write circuitry 360 generates a write voltage between the bit line 320 and the source line 340. Depending on the polarity of the voltage between bit line 320 and source line 340, the polarity of the free layer of the MTJ 305 can be changed and correspondingly the logic state can be written to the cell 301. Likewise, during a read operation, a read current is generated, which flows between the bit line 320 and source line 340 through MTJ 305. When the current is permitted to flow via transistor 310, the resistance (logic state) of the MTJ 305 can be determined based on the voltage differential between the bit line 320 and source line 340, which is compared to a reference 370 and then amplified by sense amplifier 350. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the operation and construction of the memory cell 301 is known in the art. Additional details are provided, for example, in M. Hosomi, et al., A Novel Nonvolatile Memory with Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Magnetization Switching: Spin-RAM, proceedings of IEDM conference (2005), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. <br>
<br>
[0010] The electrical write operation of STT-MRAM eliminates the scaling problem due to the magnetic write operation in MRAM. Further, the circuit design is less complicated for STT-MRAM. However, because both read and write operations are performed by passing current through the MTJ 305, there is a potential for read operations to disturb the data stored in the MTJ 305. For example, if the read current is similar to or greater in magnitude than the write current threshold, then there is a substantial chance the read operation may disturb the logic state of MTJ 305 and thus degrade the integrity of the memory.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
[0023] Aspects of embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of embodiments of the invention.<br>
<br>
[0024] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term "embodiments of the invention" does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.<br>
<br>
[0025] As discussed in the background, STT-MRAM uses a low write current for each cell, which is an advantage of this memory type over MRAM. However, cell read current can approach or be higher than the write current threshold and thus cause an invalid write operation to happen. To reduce the potential of an invalid write, embodiments of the invention use different word line (WL) voltage levels for read and write. Conventional designs apply the same WL voltage for read and write. At a given read current, the probability of an invalid write increases with the pulse width. Hence, a conventional design scheme uses a short pulse for read and a long pulse for write. In practice, this results in imbalance in read and write cycle times, often making the write <br>
<br>
cycle time unnecessarily longer than the read cycle time. In contrast, embodiments of the invention control the WL transistor strength for read and write operations. If the write cycle WL voltage level is higher than the read level, it can generate a higher write current. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to practice embodiments of the invention. For example, a pumping voltage can be used for the increased WL voltage level. Alternatively, an available power supply which is at a higher voltage than the core power supply of the memory can be used.<br>
<br>
[0026] Fig. 4A illustrates a circuit configuration 400 in a STT-MRAM during a read operation. The circuit includes a bit cell 401 including a MTJ 405 and word line transistor 410 coupled between bit line (BL) 420 and source line (SL) 440. Further, the word line transistor 410 is coupled to word line 430, as discussed above. A read isolation element 450 is coupled to the bit line 420 to isolate sense amplifier 470 during a write operation. Element 450 (e.g., read mux) can be used to select one of the bit lines during read operation as well as providing sense amplifier isolation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, read isolation element 450 can be any device or combination of devices that can couple the sense amplifier 470 to the bit line 420 during read operations and can isolate sense amplifier 470 during the write operations. For example, the isolation element 450 can be a transmission gate coupled in series with an input of sense amplifier 470. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other devices and/or combinations of devices such as multiplexers and the like may be used. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the circuit configuration illustrated herein is merely to facilitate the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention and is not intended to limit the embodiments to the illustrated elements and/or arrangements.<br>
<br>
[0027] Referring back to Fig. 4A, the isolation element 450 can receive a read enable signal (rd en) to coordinate with the read operation. A sense amplifier 470 is coupled to the bit line 420 and to a reference 472. Sense amplifier 470 can be used to determine the state of the bit cell 401 by amplifying the voltage differential between the bit line 420 and the reference 472 at the input of the sense amplifier 470 during the read operation. During the read operation transistor 410 is conducting and a read current (i rd) flows through the MTJ 405. The read isolation element 450 will be conducting and a voltage in proportion to the resistance of the MTJ 405 will be generated and detected at sense amplifier 470. As discussed above, the resistance will vary based on the logic state of the MTJ 405. Accordingly, the data stored in bit cell 401 can be read. <br>
<br>
[0028] Word line driver 432 is coupled to the word line 430 and word line transistor<br>
<br>
410. Word line driver 432 can selectively change the voltage applied to transistor 410 for the read and write operations. During the read operation, word line driver 432 provides word line 430 and transistor 410 with a second voltage (WL rd) that can be, for example, the core voltage Vdd. Referring to Fig. 4B, during write operations, word line driver 432 provides word line 430 and transistor 410 with a first voltage (WL wr) that is a higher voltage (e.g., Vpp) than the second voltage level (e.g., Vdd). For example, the word line driver 432 is illustrated as having two supply voltages, a lower voltage Vdd (e.g., a core voltage) and a higher voltage Vpp (e.g., a pumping voltage). Vdd can be at the same level as is supplied for the rest of the memory circuit (e.g., 1.2 V). For example, in some embodiments Vpp can be on the order of 40% to 100% greater than Vdd. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to this range and Vpp can be substantially higher, if the increased voltage will not damage or degrade the reliability of wordline transistor 410 or other circuit elements. Vpp can be supplied from an integrated power source, such as from a power management integrated circuit or from other external supplies. Alternatively, Vpp can be generated from Vdd using a pumping circuit, for example, as is known in the art.<br>
<br>
[0029] A write driver 500 and write isolation elements 502 and 504 are coupled between the bit line 420 and source line 440 to enable selection of a bit line and writing data to bit cell 401. As discussed above and illustrated in Fig. 4B, in a STT RAM passing current through the MTJ 405 can change the polarity of the free layer which in turn changes the resistance of the MTJ 405. This change of resistance can then be detected as a change of logic state of the bit cell 401. For example, a first write current (i wrO) can flow in a first direction to write a "0" logic state. A second write current (i wrl) can flow in a second direction opposite to the first direction to write a "1" logic state. The write isolation elements 502 and 504 can be any device or combination of devices that can selectively couple and decouple the write driver 500. For example, the write isolation elements 502 and 504 can be transmission gates coupled in series with the write driver 500. Further, the write isolation elements can receive a write enable signal (wr en) to coordinate coupling the write driver 500 during the write operation. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the write isolation elements 502 and 504 can be other devices and/or combinations of devices such as multiplexers and the like, which can be used to achieve the same functionality. Referring to Fig. 5, a circuit configuration for write line driver 500 is illustrated. The write line driver 500 <br>
<br>
can include a plurality of inverters 510, 520 and 530 configured to differentially drive the bit line (BL) and source line (SL) based on a received data input that is to be written to the bit cell.<br>
<br>
[0030] Fig. 6 is a graph 600 illustrating the word line voltage applied at the word line transistor for write and read operations for various values of Vdd. As illustrated, the word line read voltage (WL rd) 610 can be Vdd. However, the word line write voltage (WL wr) 620 is greater than WL rd by a voltage differential V delta. The higher write voltage can be used to increase the margin of the write threshold over the read. Accordingly, V delta is proportional to this increased margin, so that an increase in V delta results in an increase of the margin and a decrease in the potential for the read operation to cause an invalid write. As discussed above, WL wr can be generated using a pumping voltage, internal supply voltage (e.g., in embedded applications) or external supply voltage that is greater than the core voltage. Accordingly, graph 600 is provided merely for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention. For example, the write voltage (WL wr) could be a fixed value so V delta would be a decreasing function as Vdd increases. Alternatively, the write voltage (WL_wr) could be a multiple of Vdd (e.g., N* Vdd, where N is a fixed real number) and V delta would be an increasing function as Vdd increased. However, regardless of the strategy for generating V_delta, as long as WL_wr is greater than WL rd, a decrease in the potential for the read operation to cause an invalid write can be achieved.<br>
<br>
[0031] As discussed in relation to Fig. 4, the word line driver 432 is configured to selectively supply the word line with different voltage levels for write and read operations. The word line driver 432 can include logic to select the second (lower) voltage level for read operations and the first (higher) voltage level for write operations. For example, in a dual supply configuration the word line driver 432 can include a switching element to select the first and second voltages. The switching element may include transistors, transmission gates, multiplexers, or any other device that can select the first and second voltages, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. If a single supply is used, a pumping circuit may be included in word line driver 432 and selectively enabled for the write operations. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many configurations can be used for word line driver 432 and that embodiments of the invention are not limited to the illustrated and discussed examples provided herein. <br>
<br>
[0032] For example, referring to Fig. 7, a block diagram of the word line (WL) driver<br>
<br>
432 is illustrated. The word line driver 432 can include selection logic 710 configured to select the first voltage (e.g. Vpp) for write operations and the second voltage (V dd) for read operations. As illustrated, the selection logic 710 includes controlled switching devices 720 and 730 for selecting the first and second voltages in response to a write enable signal (wr_en) and a read enable signal (rd_en), respectively. As discussed herein it will be appreciated that the switching devices need not be any particular device or configuration, as long as the functionality of providing a higher voltage during the write operation is achieved. Further, if a pumping circuit is used it may be incorporated in the word line driver 432 and selectively enabled and disabled. Accordingly, the configurations provided herein are merely for illustration and not limitation of embodiments of the invention.<br>
<br>
[0033] Fig. 8 illustrates a circuit diagram of the word line (WL) driver 432 according to another embodiment of the invention. The first voltage (e.g. Vpp) for write operations is provided to a driver circuit 810 by transistor 804 which is activated in response to a write enable signal (wr en) buffered by inverter 802. The second voltage (Vdd) for read operations is provided to driver circuit 810 by transistor 806 which is activated in response to a read enable signal (rd en) buffered by inverter 808. Driver 810 includes transistors 812 and 814 couple to the word line (WL). Driver 810 is also selectively enabled by the word line enable (WL en) signal. Accordingly, if the write enable signal is activated (in this case a high logic state signal), transistor 804 is switched on and the first voltage (e.g., Vpp) is provided to driver 810. Upon activation of the word line enable signal (in this case a low logic state signal) for the write operation, the driver circuit 810 will turn on and provide Vpp (WL wr voltage) to the word line. Similarly, upon activation of the read enable (rd en) signal (in this case a high logic state signal), transistor 806 is switched on and the second voltage (e.g. Vdd) is provided to driver 810. Upon activation of the word line enable (in this case a low logic state signal) for the read operation, the driver circuit 810 will turn on and provide Vdd (WL rd voltage) to the word line.<br>
<br>
[0034] In view of the foregoing, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention can also include methods for performing the functions, sequence of actions and/or algorithms described herein. For example, an embodiment of the invention can include a method for read and write operations in a Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) device including applying a <br>
<br>
first voltage to a word line transistor of a bit cell during a write operation; and applying a second voltage to the word line transistor during a read operation, wherein the first voltage is higher than the second voltage. The method can further include generating the first voltage by pumping a common voltage source, wherein the common voltage source is used for the second voltage. Alternatively, as discussed above, the first voltage and the second voltage may each be provided from separate power sources. Methods according to embodiments of the invention can further include selecting the first voltage in response to a write enable signal and selecting the second voltage in response to a read enable signal. Still further methods can include supplying a first voltage to word line in response to a word line enable signal during a write operation and the second voltage to the word line in response to the word line enable signal during the read operation. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that any of the alternative functionalities describe herein may further be included in methods of embodiments of the invention.
