				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention refers to an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid.<br>
The technical use, in particular in personal hygiene and foodstuffs, and<br>
prophylactic application of the reductone, ascorbic acid, is often made more<br>
difficult in that the ascorbic acid is not sufficiently stable in aqueous solution.<br>
Consequently, in an aqueous ascorbic acid solution onlv about 70% of the added<br>
ascorbic acid is still present after 30 days.<br>
Attempts have been made to improve the stability in that instead of ascorbic acid,<br>
one of its derivatives, for example sodium ascorbic phosphate or ascorbyl<br>
palmitate, has been employed. The content of this active substance is almost fully<br>
retained in aqueous solution over a long period of time. However, the derivative is<br>
many times more expensive than pure ascorbic acid. In addition, at higher<br>
concentrations the ascorbic acid derivatives' tend to crystallize out and lead to<br>
colouration of the end product.<br>
From the European Patent Specification 660676 a combination is known consisting<br>
of 0.1-2.0 % by weight of an oil-soluble constituent which is preferably a<br>
colorizing carotenoid, 2-20 % by weight of an emulsifier with an HLB value of 10-<br>
18 and 0.1-1.0 % by weight of an antioxidation agent. The emulsifier can be<br>
Polysorbate 40 or 60 and ascorbic acid is one of the recommended antioxidation<br>
agents. With this technique, coloured clear and stable drinks for health care should<br>
be able to be produced. The stability of the ascorbic acid in the end product is<br>
however still not explained.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide ascorbic acid in a fluid, water and flit-<br>
soluble and encapsulated form (e.g. gelatine capsule), which is stable over many<br>
months and is available in high concentration.<br>
According to the invention, this object is resolved in that an aqueous solution of<br>
ascorbic acid contains an excess of an emulsifier with an HLB value of 9 - 18, such<br>
as a polysorbate, preferably Polysorbate 80. At room temperature the solution is<br>
clear and almost gel-like, can be diluted with water without becoming turbid and<br><br>
on heating to approximately 35°C can be mixed, trouble-free and homogeneously<br>
with aqueous or fatty end products from the cosmetics or foodstuffs fields without<br>
further processing steps. The ascorbic acid part of the solution according to the<br>
invention, which may be up to 20 % by weight, is retained over at least half a year<br>
almost without loss. The polysorbate part is effectively about 60 % by weight and<br>
the rest is water. The ascorbic acid solubilisate according to the invention can be<br>
easily added to cosmetics (skin and hair care products), foodstuffs, medicaments<br>
and nutrient solutions for the breeding of cell and bacterial cultures as well as for<br>
algae (microalgae) with the result that the stability of these products is increased<br>
substantially.<br>
The ascorbic acid is available micellated in the solubilisate. An electron<br>
microscope examination of a 10% ascorbic acid solubilisate in a dilution of 1:1000<br>
exhibits a micelle diameter of about 100 nm. Since the emulsifier envelope of the<br>
micelles only releases the enclosed ascorbic acid with a delay (in a retarded<br>
manner), the antioxidative effect of the solubilisate according to the invention in<br>
the agents mentioned remains effective in combination with solubilised mixed<br>
tocopherols longer than of, say, ascorbyl palmitate, i.e. one of the ascorbic acid<br>
derivatives mentioned earlier.<br>
Regarding the physiological aspects of nutrition, during the oral intake of the<br>
solubilisate according to the invention, the micellation of the ascorbic acid by the<br>
emulsifier prevents the ascorbic acid from developing its effect and being<br>
consumed already in the central digestive tract, i.e. in the stomach and duodenum.<br>
The micellated ascorbic acid is rather initially resorbed in the small intestine.<br>
In a particularly preferred arrangement of the invention, the ascorbic acid<br>
solubilisate contains an addition of tocopherol, in particular a mix of α-, β-, γ- and<br>
5-tocopherol. Through the addition of this ascorbic acid tocopherol solubilisate to<br>
organic oils, e.g. vegetable oils such as sunflower oil, thistle oil, linseed oil, etc.,<br>
their stability can be substantially improved. As tocopherol, either pure α-<br>
tocopherol or, particularly preferred, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and 5-tocopherol can be<br><br>
considered. Mixed tocopherols are recommended which contain about 8.0 to about<br>
20.0 % by weight of α-tocopherol, about 1.5 to about 4.5 % by weight of β-<br>
tocopherol, about 55.0 to about 70.0 % by weight of γ-tocopherol and about 15.0 to<br>
about 27.0 % by weight of 8-tocopherol.<br>
If an octadecatrienoic acid and/or an octadecenoic acid, say in the form of α-<br>
linolenic acid, γ-linolenic acid, linoleic acid or oleic acid, is added to the solution<br>
according to the invention, the viscosity of the solution is reduced. It is clear at<br>
room temperature, viscous, can be diluted with water without turbidity or can be<br>
mixed with aqueous and/or fatty nutriments, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals<br>
without further processing steps. The polysorbate content of the solution according<br>
to the invention develops a type of retarding function for the conservative<br>
characteristic of the ascorbic acid for the generally easily oxidizable ingredients of<br>
ointments and similar preparations. Consequently, the desired protective function<br>
of the ascorbic acid is retained over an extended period. The ascorbic acid content<br>
of the solution can effectively lie between 5 % by weight to about 15 % by weight.<br>
The solution can advantageously contain about 10 % by weight to about 20 % by<br>
weight of an octadecatrienoic acid and/or octadecenoic acid. The polysorbate part<br>
is preferably about 60 % by weight to about 75% by weight.<br>
If the proportion of water in the solution is reduced to between about 5 % by<br>
weight to about 7 % by weight and the polysorbate proportion is increased<br>
correspondingly, the solution, which is viscous at room temperature, can also be<br>
mixed with active substances which are then filled into gelatine capsules or<br>
gelatine-free capsules. The low proportion of water in the solution leaves the case<br>
of the capsule undamaged, whereby the protective function of the ascorbic acid for<br>
the active component remains unimpaired.<br>
A procedure for the manufacture of the solution according to the invention<br>
provides that an emulsifier with an HLB value of about 9 to about 18. a polysorbate<br>
for example, effectively Polysorbate 80, is added to an aqueous ascorbic acid<br>
solution and the mixture is briefly heated with stirring until it becomes clear and<br><br>
homogeneous. The micelles forming in the solution and having a diameter of about<br>
100 nm exhibit a double-walled envelope of radially orientated polysorbate<br>
molecules, whereby the polysorbate molecules of the inner envelope are aligned<br>
with their hydrophilic sections towards the ascorbic acid solution and the<br>
hydrophilic sections of the polysorbate molecules in the outer envelope are<br>
arranged towards the outside. The solution obtained in this manner can be diluted<br>
in water without becoming turbid and can be employed technically without further<br>
processing steps.<br>
The stability of the micelles is increased if, in a further development of the<br>
invention, a light natural oil, mainly consisting of triglycerides, such as say thistle<br>
oil, is added to the aqueous ascorbic acid solution together with the emulsifier. The<br>
oil micelles which are then formed adhere to the ascorbic acid micelles and protect<br>
them.<br>
Practically, an octadecatrienoic acid and/or an octadecenoic acid, say in the form of<br>
α-linolenic acid, γ-linolenic acid, linoleic acid or oleic acid, is added to the solution<br>
before the polysorbate is added and after slight heating to about 50°C. For the<br>
filling capsules, the cases of which consist of gelatine or which can be free of<br>
gelatine, it is advantageous if ascorbic acid is dissolved in the same quantity of<br>
distilled water, the same or up to a maximum of twice as much fatty acids as<br>
ascorbic acid is added under slight heating and approximately two to about three<br>
times the quantity of Polysorbate 80 added and the mixture heated to about 80°C<br>
and stirred.<br>
The following embodiment examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
20g of ascorbic acid are completely dissolved in 20g of distilled, degassed water.<br>
The dissolving stage can be speeded up if the water is heated to about 45°C. Then<br>
60g of Polysorbate 80 are added to the solution with stirring and heating to about<br><br>
80°C. It is stirred until the solubilisate becomes clear and homogeneous, with the<br>
solubilisate appearing clear and almost gel-like at room temperature, dilutable in<br>
water without turbidity and can be added without further processing steps to<br>
compositions to be preserved or foodstuffs, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.<br>
For a less concentrated solubilisate, 10g of ascorbic acid is dissolved in 10g of<br>
distilled water and 80g of Polysorbate is added, the remaining process being as<br>
above. From the 10% ascorbic acid solubilisate produced from this, an electron<br>
microscope image, which is reproduced in Figure 1, was made after aqueous<br>
dilution of the solubilisate to 1:1000. It can be seen that the ascorbic acid<br>
solubilisate micelles have a diameter of about 100 nm. Putting the solubilisate in<br>
paraffin permits the micelle diameter to be reduced to half, as can be seen from the<br>
lower electron microscope image in Figure 1. This phenomenon can be explained<br>
in that the micelles lose the outer polysorbate envelope in paraffin.<br>
Example 2<br>
As in Example 1, 10% by weight of ascorbic acid (referred to the overall quantity<br>
of ascorbic acid solubilisate = 100%) is dissolved in 10% by weight of distilled<br>
water and 70% by weight of Polysorbate 80 is added to this aqueous solution<br>
together with 10% by weight of a light vegetable oil, such as thistle oil or linseed<br>
oil. This is then heated to at least 60°C and stirred until the solubilisate becomes<br>
clear and homogeneous with the solubilisate being dissolved clearly and without<br>
residue in water at room temperature.<br>
If the content of ascorbic acid is reduced to about 1% by weight and the water<br>
content also to about 7% by weight and the other proportions of the solubilisate are<br>
increased accordingly, it can, due to the relatively low proportion of water, be<br>
particularly well employed as a preservative for active substances which are to be<br>
encapsulated as retard preparations. The capsule case is virtually left unattacked by<br>
the solubilisate which would be expected with a high water content.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
10g of ascorbic acid are dissolved in 10g of distilled water and 20g of thistle oil<br>
added to the solution. To this mixture 110g of Polysorbate 80 arc added, the whole<br>
stirred with heating at about 100°C until free of water, i.e. until boiling terminates.<br>
After cooling to room temperature a 6.5% ascorbic acid solubilisate is present<br>
in the solubiliser, the water content of which is clearly below 5% by volume and<br>
which is both soluble in water as well as in fats and oils. Testing of the ascorbic<br>
acid content of the solution by an independent chemical examination laboratory at<br>
the time the solution was produced and more than five months later showed that the<br>
loss of ascorbic acid over this period was only about 3%.<br>
Example 4<br>
Here, the starting point is the solubilisate according to Example 2. A mixed<br>
tocopherol solubilisate, which is produced in the following manner, is added to it.<br>
10% by weight of mixed tocopherol (referred to the mixed tocopherol solubilisate<br>
= 100% by weight) is mixed with 90% by weight of Polysorbate 20 by stirring,<br>
whereby the mixing process is speeded up by heating to about 60°C. Stirring is<br>
continued until clarity is obtained and the solubilisate can be easily dissolved in<br>
water. For the mixed tocopherol an addition of 91mg/g of mixed tocopherol to a-<br>
tocopherol, 21mg/g to β-tocopherol, 608mg/g to γ-tocopherol and 209mg/g to 8-<br>
tocopherol is recommended.<br>
Then about 3 parts by weight of the solubilisate according to the first alternative in<br>
Example 2 are mixed with about 7 parts by weight of the mixed tocopherol<br>
solubilisate, whereby slight heating to about 50°C speeds up the mixing process.<br>
Stirring under heat is carried out until an homogeneous and clear solubilisate is<br>
produced, 1g of this product therefore contains about 70mg of mixed tocopherol<br>
and about 30mg of ascorbic acid. This solubilisate can be employed as an effective<br>
antioxidant for the improvement of the stability of foodstuff colorants, oils,<br>
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and similar products.<br><br>
Comparative tests show that, independent of the properties of the end product<br>
(hydrophilic or hydrophobic) this solubilisate can be incorporated into end products<br>
directly and without intermediate production steps and offers better protection<br>
against oxidation then the same quantity of ascorbic acid from an ascorbic acid<br>
derivative, such as for example ascorbyl palmitate. Also, the relative lack of colour<br>
in the solubilisate in comparison to the ascorbic acid derivatives represents an<br>
advantage. Depending on requirements, for example. 1 to 10g of solubilisate can be<br>
added to about 1000g of the end product.<br>
From a nutritional point of view, the physiological advantage of this solubilisate<br>
lies in the micelles which are stable in gastric acid and which ensure that ascorbic<br>
acid (Vitamin C) and (with the use of α-tocopherol) Vitamin E reach the small<br>
intestine without loss where they can be resorbed. This advantage can also be<br>
exploited for other vitamins, for example retinol (Vitamin A) and P-carotene, and<br>
can be obtained with the following example of a multi-vitamin preparation:<br>
Example 5<br>
20% by weight of ct-tocopherol, under heat as required at about 50°C, are mixed<br>
with 80% by weight of Polysorbate 20 until clarity and homogeneity are obtained<br>
through stirring.<br>
10% by weight of retinol is mixed in the same manner with 90% by weight of<br>
Polysorbate 80.<br>
Finally, 10% by weight of a concentrate, which contains about 30% of P-carotene<br>
(obtainable from La Roche), is mixed with 90% by weight of Polysorbate 80 in an<br>
appropriate manner to form a reddish brown, transparent solubilisate which<br>
dissolves clearly in warm water.<br>
Then 85% by weight of the ascorbic acid solubilisate according to the first<br>
alternative in Example 2 is effectively mixed with 10% by weight of the above ct-<br>
tocopherol solubilisate and with 2% by weight of the above retinol solubilisate and<br>
finally with 3% by weight of the β-carotene solubilisate under slight heat while<br><br>
stirring until a homogeneous and transparent mixed solubilisate is obtained. This<br>
water-soluble vitamin solubilisate can be packaged in gelatine or gelatine-free<br>
capsules or directly incorporated into aqueous and/or fat-soluble end products<br>
without additional processing steps.<br>
When put into water and/or clear fruit juice, the vitamin solubilisate according to<br>
the invention gives a stable and clear solution, in contrast to emulsions or<br>
liposomes. The product micelles are stable in gastric acid. The resorption of the fat-<br>
soluble substances located in the micelles, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin E and p-<br>
carotene occurs in the small intestine without involving bile salts and enzymes.<br>
Consequently, the quoted active substances in this micellated form are more<br>
quickly biologically available.<br>
1g of the vitamin solubilisate with the above composition and incorporated into<br>
foodstuffs or packaged in capsules covers the human daily requirement of Vitamins<br>
A, C, E and P-carotene. The composition of the vitamin solubilisate quoted with<br>
the figures above is geared to this application. This takes into account that the daily<br>
requirement of Vitamin C is substantially higher than for the other vitamins.<br>
However, the scope of the invention also enables other compositions to be selected<br>
for the vitamin solubilisate and/or one or the other vitamin to be completely<br>
omitted if the presence of a certain vitamin is not required or desirable for the<br>
planned application.<br>
Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the mean micelle radii of the α-tocopherol solubilisate, the<br>
β-carotene solubilisate and the retinol solubilisate. As can be seen, the mean<br>
micelle radii are 10 nm and for the retinol solubilisate down to just about 8 nm.<br>
The measurements were carried out with the field flow fractionation from Wyatt<br>
Technologies. Figure 5 shows an electron microscope image of a vitamin A micelle<br>
and Figure 6 an electron microscope image of Vitamin E micelles; the samples<br>
were an aqueous solution of I : 1000 of the above described solubilisate.<br><br>
