"FUEL-CELL-POWERED FOUR-WHEEL AUTOMOBILE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN GOKYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-Chome, Minato -ku, Tokyo, JAPAN<br><br><br>
It is therefore | an object of the present invention to provide a technology for optimally placing a fuel cell, a reforming unit, or a secondary battery in installing a fuel cell on a four-wheel automobile. To achieve the above object, a fuel-cell-powered four-wheel automobile has a chassis which is of a rectangular shape as viewed in plan with four wheels positioned at respective four corners thereof, a riding seat disposed substantially centrally on the chassis, a flat floor mounted on the chassis in front of the riding seat, and an electric motor for moving the four-wheel automobile. A tank is disposed beneath the floor for storing methanol and water. A reforming unit is disposed beneath the floor for generating hydrogen frorri methanol and water supplied from the tank. A fuel cell is disposed beneath the floor for generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen generated by the reforming unit and oxygen in air.! Finally, a secondary battery is disposed beneath the floor for storing electricity generated by the fuel cell.<br>
Since the tank, the reforming unit, the fuel cell, and the secondary battery are disposed beneath the floor, mechanisms for generating electricity from air, methanol, and water are centralized. As a result, a function to generate electricity from air, methanol, and water can be accommodated in one unit, and the components including the tank, the reforming unit, the fuel cell, and the secondary battery can be made compact.<br>
To       use     the     fuel    cell       13,     there	are      required        a<br><br>
fuel tank for storing methanol, a reforming unit for generating hydrogen, and a secondary battery for storing generated electricity, in addition to the fuel cell 13, as described later on.  The layout of the fuel cell 13, the reforming unit, and the secondary battery is of an important concern in installing them on a four-wheel automobile.  One example of a fuel cell system based on the principles of electric power generation by a fuel cell will be described below.<br>
FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b) are views illustrative of the principles of electric power generation by a fuel cell. FIG. 6(a) shows the principles of an electrolysis of water, and FIG. 6(b) shows the principles of electric power generation by a fuel cell.<br>
In FIG. 6(a), water (H20) with an electrolyte such as sulfuric acid (H2S04) dissolved therein is placed in a water tank 101, and electrodes 102, 103 of platinum or the like are put in the water tank 101.  The electrodes 102, 103 are covered with respective cases 104, 105, and a D.C. power supply 106 is connected between the electrodes 102, 103.  According to the well known principles of an electrolysis of water, an oxygen gas (02) is generated at the electrode 103 which serves as a<br><br><br>
negative electrode, and a hydrogen gas (H2) is generated at the electrode 102 which serves as a positive electrode. The arrows (e") indicate a flow of charges, and the arrows (H+) indicate a flow of hydrogen ions.<br>
In FIG. 6(b), which shows a process that is a reversal of the process shown in FIG. 6(a), an oxygen gas (02) is placed in one case 104, and a hydrogen gas (H2) is placed in the other case 105, and a load 107 is connected between the electrodes 102, 103.  When the oxygen gas (02) and the hydrogen gas (H2) are subjected to an electrochemical reaction in water (H20) with an electrolyte such as sulfuric acid (H2S04) dissolved therein, a current flows through the load 107.  The oxygen gas (02) and the hydrogen gas (H2) are combined into water (H20).<br>
The reversal of the electrolysis of water shown in FIG. 6(a) represents the principles of electric power generation by a fuel cell.  A fuel cell system will be described below. {0005] â– <br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing a fuel cell system by way of example.  A fuel cell system 110 comprises a fuel tank 111 for storing methanol, a<br><br><br>
reforming unit 112 for generating hydrogen from methanol and water, a fuel cell 113 for causing an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen generated by the reforming unit 112 and oxygen in air, a first pump 115 for delivering air in the atmosphere through an air cleaner 114 into the fuel cell 113, a second pump 116 for delivering hydrogen from the reforming unit 112 into the fuel cell 113, a catalyzer (catalyst) 117 for receiving a water vapor discharged from the fuel cell 113 and a carbon dioxide gas produced by the reforming unit 112 and fed through the fuel cell 113 and reducing the amount of the carbon dioxide gas, a water tank 118 for receiving water discharged from the catalyzer 117, a secondary battery 119 for storing electricity generated by the fuel cell 113, and a motor 122 connected to the secondary battery 119 through a controller 121.  The secondary battery 119 also stores electricity generated by the motor 122.<br>
In FIG. 7, the blank arrow (CH3OH) represents a flow of methanol, the blank arrow (H2) a flow of hydrogen gas, the blank arrow (02) a flow of oxygen gas, the blank arrow (H20 + C02) a flow of water vapor and carbon dioxide gas, and the blank arrow (H20) a flow of water. <br><br><br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
As described above, to the fuel cell 113 as an energy source of a four-wheel automobile (not shown), the fuel tank 111 for storing methanol, the reforming unit<br>
112	for generating hydrogen, and the secondary battery 119 for storing electricity generated by the fuel cell<br>
113	are required.  For installing the fuel tank 111, the reforming unit 112, and the fuel cell 113 on the four-wheel automobile, it is necessary to take into account weight balancing, maintenance services, design details or the like, and a variety of layout proposals need to be analyzed for the fuel cell system 110.<br>
^0008]<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a technology for optimally placing a fuel cell, a reforming unit, or a secondary battery in installing a fuel cell on a four-wheel automobile.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>

Methanol and water are supplied from the tank to the reforming unit, which generates hydrogen from the methanol and the water.  The generated hydrogen is supplied to the fuel cell, which generates electricity. The generated electricity is supplied to the electric motor to rotate the electric motor, thus moving the four-wheel automobile.<br>
Since the tank, the reforming unit, the fuel eel and the secondary battery are disposed beneath the floor, mechanisms for generating electricity from air, methanol, and water are centralized.  As a result, a function to generate electricity from air, methanol, and water can be<br><br>
accommodated in one unit, and the components including the tank, the reforming unit, the fuel cell, and the secondary battery can be made compact.<br>
	Further     the   fuel -cell -powered   four-<br>
wheel automobile is characterized in that the fuel cell* and the electric motor are disposed respectively oh the left and right sides or the right and left sides :of a central line which divides the chassis into left and right portions .<br>
It is important to keep the weight of the chassis of the four-wheel automobile in balance.  The weight of the chassis is kept in good balance by positioning the fuel cell and the electric motor respectively on the left and nrgh-t sidas ox tire rjLgJaJL ami i_e_ft_ sides of the central line which divides the chassis into the left and right portions.<br>

Screws 48 extend through the attachment holes 45c of the case 45 and the attachment holes 46c of the floor 46 to attach the case 45 and the floor 46 integrally to the chassis frame 12.     (<br>
The fuel cell unit 40 is a unit which accommodates the tank 41, the reforming unit 42, the fuel cell 43, and the secondary battery 44, and allows them to<br><br>
be easily mounted on the chassis 11 (see FIG. 1).<br>
Operation of the fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 described above will be described below.<br>
FIG. 4 is a view illustrative of a first mode of operation of the fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile according to the present invention.<br>
The fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 has the chassis 11 which is of a rectangular shape as viewed in plan with the four wheels, i.e., the front wheels 14 and the rear wheels 16, positioned at respective four corners thereof, the riding seat 13 disposed substantially centrally on the chassis 11, the flat floor 46 mounted on the chassis 11 in front of the riding seat 13, and the electric motor 51 for moving the four-wheel automobile, and is characterized by the tank 41 disposed beneath the floor 46 for storing methanol and water, the reforming unit 42 disposed beneath the floor 46 for generating hydrogen from methanol and water supplied from the tank 41, the fuel cell 43 disposed beneath the floor 46 for generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen generated by the reforming unit 42 and oxygen in air, and the secondary battery 44 disposed beneath the floor 46 for storing<br><br>
electricity generated by the fuel cell 43.<br>
The fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 is propelled by supplying methanol and water from the tank 41 to the reforming unit 42, generating hydrogen from the methanol and the water with the reforming unit 42, supplying the hydrogen to the fuel cell 43, generating electricity with the fuel cell 43, and supplying the electricity to the electric motor 51 to rotate the electric motor 51. [OOZlrh<br>
Since the tank 41, the reforming unit 42, the fuel cell 43, and the secondary battery 44 are disposed beneath the floor 46, the center of gravity of the fuel-cell -powered four-wheel automobile 10 is lowered.<br>
Because the tank 41, the reforming unit 42, the fuel cell 43, and the secondary battery 44 are disposed beneath the floor 46, mechanisms for generating electricity from air, methanol, and water are centralized. As a result, a function to generate electricity from air, methanol, and water can be accommodated in one unit, and the components including the tank 41, the reforming unit 42, the fuel cell 43, and the secondary battery 44 can be made compact.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is a view illustrative of a second mode of operation of the fuel-cell-powered four-wheel automobile according to the present invention, and shows an operation flow of the power system 30.<br>
In the power system 30, methanol (CH3OH) and water (H20) are delivered from the tank 41 to the reforming unit 42 as indicated by the arrow Â©, and the reforming unit 42 generates hydrogen (H2) .<br>
The hydrogen (H2) generated by the reforming unit 42 is delivered to the fuel cell 43 as indicated by the arrow (D, and oxygen (02) in the atmosphere is supplied to the fuel cell 43 as indicated by the arrow (D, causing the fuel cell 43 to generate electricity. [JO? "3]-*<br>
Water vapor (H02) generated from the fuel cell 43 and carbon dioxide (C02) generated by the reforming unit 42 and delivered via the fuel cell 43 are discharged, and exhaust gases including the carbon dioxide (C02) are reduced by a catalyst (not shown).  Thereafter, the exhaust gases are discharged from the exhaust pipe 35 into the atmosphere as indicated by the arrow Â©.  The gases generated from the fuel cell 43 or the reforming unit 42 may contain a small amount of carbon monoxide and<br><br><br>
hydrocarbon.  These gases are also reduced by the catalyst.  A flow of electricity will be described below. [410-2-4-3-<br>
The electricity generated by the fuel cell 43 is supplied to the electric motor 51 as indicated by the arrow Â©, and stored in the secondary battery 44 as indicated by the arrow Â©.  The electricity is supplied from the secondary battery 44 to the electric motor 51 as indicated by the arrow Â©.<br>
The power system 30 has the fuel cell 43 and the electric motor 51 that are disposed respectively on the left and right sides or the right and left sides of a central line C which divides the chassis (see FIG. 1) into left and right portions.<br>
In the fuel-cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 (see FIG. 1), it is important to keep the weight of the chassis 11 in balance.  The weight of the chassis 11 is kept in good balance by positioning the fuel cell 43 and the electric motor 51 respectively on the left and right sides or the right and left sides of the central line C which divides the chassis 11 into the left and right portions.<br>
r<br><br>
In the above embodiment, the fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 has been described as a buggy as shown in FIG. 1.  However, the fuel - cell-powered four-wheel automobile 10 is not limited to a buggy, but may be a four-wheel automobile with a fuel cell mounted thereon.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>

According to claim 1, a tank is disposed beneath the floor for storing methanol and water, a reforming unit is disposed beneath the floor for generating hydrogen from methanol and water supplied from the tank, a fuel cell is disposed beneath the floor for generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen generated by the reforming unit and oxygen in air, and a secondary battery is disposed beneath the floor for storing electricity generated by the fuel cell. Therefore, mechanisms for generating electricity from air, methanol, and water are centralized.  As a result, a function to generate electricity from air, methanol, and water can be accommodated in one unit, and the components including the tank, the reforming unit, the fuel cell, and the secondary battery can be made compact.<br><br><br>
According to claim 2, the fuel cell and the electric motor are disposed respectively on the left and right sides or the right and left sides of a central line which divides the chassis into left and right portions. Therefore, the weight of the chassis is kept in good balance.<br>
