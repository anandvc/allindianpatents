PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following  specification  particularly  describes  the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
A wheel chair with commode for a patient that converts in to a bed (that enables to lift the patient off the bed)<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a multipurpose wheel chair for patients. More particularly it relates to a wheel chair with commode which can convert in to a bed and which enables the patient to be lifted up and off the bed for providing him airing, sponging  and for changing bed or bed sheet.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Lifting and shifting of a disabled/bedridden person has always been difficult, risky and problematic. This lifting and shifting is dangerous and painful for the disabled person if done by an untrained person. The patients are scared of this procedure, as there is a danger of slipping and falling and getting injured.<br>
This lifting and shifting is strenuous for the nurse. When he/she is trying to lift the patient, he/she has to bend over the patient to lift him. This posture in the long run gives the nurses a back pain and can turn into permanent back problems. A lot of medical literature is available on back problems of nurses as it is very common in nurses.<br>
A disabled person mainly needs to be shifted from bed for change of bed or bed sheet. The person also needs to be lifted for putting a bed pan under him. This lifting and shifting is painful and dangerous for the disabled/ bedridden person. A patient gets bed sore and skin trouble due to contact with bed as some portions of skin do not get any airing which causes infections and proves fatal on most occasions.<br>
2<br><br>
Many lifting and shifting apparatus are available in the market. All these apparatus are expensive and unpractical at home as it takes a lot of space and a lot of training for the user. In hospitals some help is available but at home one is helpless and finds lifting and shifting very difficult.<br>
It has been observed that it is very difficult to nurse bedridden persons, the main difficulties are<br>
i.	Shifting of patient from bed to wheel chair for transport<br>
ii.	Shifting of patient from wheel chair to bed for sleeping or rest<br>
iii.	Lifting the person up for airing for long time<br>
iv.	Lifting the person off the bed for change of bed or bed sheet<br>
v.	Lifting the person for putting bed pan under him.<br>
On normal beds available for these purposes, part of the patient's body does not get airing and his weight is constant on some parts of his body which causes bed sores and skin infection. The need was felt that patient should be kept in such position that all his body should get airing and the constant weight on some parts should be eliminated for some time.<br>
JP10179645 provides wheel chair for nursing care. This wheel chair for nursing care consists of an L-shape supporting frame equipped with a holding frame and a pedestal and a truck on which the frame is installed. The truck has casters which can freely move around in all directions, and is of such a height as to allow itself to be introduced into a space below a bed for nursing care. In addition, the truck has a lift drive device mounted on the lateral part and also is of such a U-shape that one of the sides is open. Therefore, a patient can be positioned right above a stool in such a way that the truck 4 holds the stool.<br>
3<br><br>
Besides, an ordinary-type flat truck can be used and also a motor-driven truck can be applied to this wheel chair. The lift drive device is constructed of a cylinder or a rack/pinion mechanism, or chain or motor-driven.<br>
DE10241008 provides a wheel chair has a telescopic frame to provide continuously adjustable wheelbase, setting holes to give adjustable distance between pivoted wheel axis and frame and an adjustable seat position in the frame fork.<br>
The wheel chair available in the market is used only for shifting purpose. It is not provided with lifting and bed facility. Also it does not have commode facility.<br>
Hence there is a need of an improved wheel chair or bed or lifting &amp; shifting apparatus for a patient which will address and overcome all the problems of the wheel chair or bed or lifting &amp; shifting apparatus of the prior art.<br>

Now referring to figures, wheel chair of the present invention comprises outer main frame (c). This rectangular shaped frame stands on four wheeled legs (o, p). There may be more number of legs. This frame basically supports the hip portion of the patient's body. Wheel chair further comprises four more outer frames (a, b, d, e). These four frames are connected to each other by pivots or hinges. The frame (a) supports the head portion of the patient. This frame is connected to the rear legs (p) of the main frame (c) through a link (f) and to a frame (b) by a hinge (r). The frame (b) supports the upper body portion of the patient. It is connected to frame (d) via link (g). The frame (d) supports the leg portion of the patient and is connected to frame (e) by hinge (r). The stopper is provided at the hinge (r) to stop the further movement of the frames. Frame (e) supports the foot portion of the leg of the patient and is provided with caster wheel below it. The movements of frames (a, b, d, e) to convert chair into bed and vice versa is controlled by gear box (j) along with cable (k) or gears (kll, kl2). This gear box is provided beneath the main frame (c). Each outer frame (a, b, c, d, e) is provided with turnable turnable bars (al) having arms (a2) on its periphery.<br>
The additional wheels (n) are provided to prevent the chair or bed from tilting backward due to weight of frames (a, b). These additional wheels (n) are connected to frame (d) by means of links (i, h). These links pulls the additional wheels (n) either nearer to or far away from the rear wheels (p).<br>
The wheel chair further comprises plurality of straps/ nets (a3) which are provided across the width of the bed for accommodating the patient's body over it when patient is lifted up off the bed. These straps/nets (a3) are provided on the bed below patient's body. One end of these straps or nets is fixed to the outer frames (a, b, c, d, e) and other end is connected to the arms (a2) of an turnable bar (al)Also there is provided a lifting means for lifting the body of patient over the straps or nets.<br>
10<br><br>
The wheel chair of the present invention can be converted in to a bed also. The width of the chair is 24". After converting it into bed, the width of the bed needs to be increased. The wheel chair of the present invention provides width of 36" in a bed position. This increase in the width is possible by inner frames (t). These inner frames (t) slidably fitted inside the outer frames (a, b, c, d, e). The outer frames of the present invention are made up of squared hollow pipes in which inner frames accommodated slidably. The inner frames (t) are pulled inside the outer frames (a, b, c, d, e) during use of wheel chair as a chair and pulled outside while using wheel chair as a bed to increase the dimension of the bed. Every inner frame is connected to adjacent inner frame using a hinge (x). The movement of inner frames (t) is controlled by the threaded rods (y). These rods (y) are attached to the frames by means of steel strips (z) and rivets or nut bolts. All threaded rods (y) of inner frames (t) are connected by a chain (u) and handle (w) assembly, so that they all turn together, when handle (w) is turned. Further inner frames (t) are provided with side guards (a7) for supporting the straps or nets (a3) over it and for avoiding the patient from falling down.<br>
The wheel chair of the present invention also comprises the commode pan or pot (m) being fitted under the main frame (c) with the help of hinge (r) and linkage (s). A cushion is provided between main frame (c) and commode pan or pot (m). The position of commode pan or pot (m) and cushion is controlled by a pair of gear boxes (jl, j2) in which one (jl) is provided near commode pan or pot and other (j2) is at the rear wheels of the outer main frame. These gear boxes are provided with gears (kl, k2).<br>
All gearboxes, turnable bars and lifting means used in present invention can be operated mechanically, electrically with electric motor, pneumatically with pneumatic force or hydraulically with hydraulic force.<br>
11<br><br>
The wheel chair of the present invention has the following application modes:<br>
i.	Chair<br>
ii.	Easy chair<br>
iii.	Bed<br>
iv.	Commode<br>
v.	Lifting up the patient off the bed to provide airing and for changing<br>
bed or bed sheet<br>
Now we will see each application mode in greater details with the help of drawings.<br>
i.	Chair:<br>
Referring to figure 2, the drive shaft of the gear box (j) is turned to wind cable (k) fully in winder (1). This cable pulls frame (d) towards front legs (o) of the chair. Frame (d) and frame (b) are connected by linkage (g). This linkage pushes frame (b) into an upright position. Frame (a) is connected to the rear legs (p) of the chair through link (f), due to which frame (a) is folded backwards. Frame (e) has caster wheel below. As the caster wheel touches the ground, frame (e) is pushed to almost a right angle position with frame (d). Additional wheels (n) are pulled nearer to rear wheels (p) of the chair.<br>
ii.       Easy chair:<br>
Referring to figure 3, the weight of frame (a), (b) and linkage (g) naturally tends to be in horizontal position. As the gear box (j) shaft is turned to unwind cable (k), it allows frame (d) to move away from front legs (o) of<br>
12<br><br>
the chair. Due to the weight of frame (b) and (a), both the frames (a) and (b) start traveling towards horizontal position. Frame (d) provides supports for legs, frame (c) provides sitting and frame (b) provides back rest. In the process of unwinding cable (k), these frames (b) and (d) can be stopped at different positions of comfort. Additional wheels (n) starts moving away from rear legs (p) due to linkage (i +h). These additional wheels stop the chair from tilting backwards due to weight of frames (a), (b) and the patient. In this way chair can be converted into easy chair.<br>
iii.      Bed:<br>
As shown in figure 4, further unwinding of cable (k), by turning gear box (j), allows frame (d) to become horizontal in position. Frame (e) is connected to frame (d) by hinges (r) and a stopper (q). Frame (e) is pulled up with frame (d) and is stopped by stopper (q) at a parallel position to frame (d). Frames (b) and (a) travel further to a horizontal position by weight. As frame (b) and (d) are linked, both become horizontal and parallel. Frame (a) also travels down with frame (b). Frame (a) is connected to frame (b) by hinge (r). As frame (a) comes down with frame (b), linkage (f) pushes it to a horizontal position. As a result of fully unwinding cable (k) frames (a, b, c, d, e) become horizontal and parallel, and thus the chair converts into a comfortable bed. The additional wheels (n) are pushed fully away from the rear legs (p) of wheel chair, due to linkage (h + i). These additional wheels provide stability, stops the bed from toppling and thus the bed becomes stable with the available wheels. The length of the bed becomes 78" or more.<br>
It is already explained how winding and unwinding of cable can convert the wheel chair into easy chair and bed and vice versa. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) will explain how this can be done with gear box and gears. A gear box<br>
13<br><br>
(j) is fitted to wheel chair frame (c). This gear box contains driving gear (kll). The driven gear (kl2) is welded into frame (b). As the driving gear (kll) is turned into one direction, it pulls the driven gear (kl2). The driven gear (kl2) being welded to frame (b), pulls down frame (b). As frame (b) is connected to frame (d) through linkage (g), frame (d) is pushed upwards. As frame (a) is connected to wheel chair frame (c) through linkage (f), frame is pushed towards a horizontal position. Further turning of driving gear (kll) will thus get the wheel chair into easy chair position. Further turning of driven wheel (kl2) will get all frames into a straight horizontal line. This is how a wheel chair will be converted into a flat bed. Turning of driving gear (kll) into opposite direction will fold the different frames of the bed, thus converting the bed back into a wheel chair.<br>
The width of the chair is 24". After converting it into bed position, the width of the bed needs to be increased. Frames (a, b, c, d, e) are made of hollow square pipes. They are made in such a way that smaller frames (t) i.e. inner frames can slide inside the square pipes. Theses frames (t) are controlled by the threaded rods or jacks (y). Frames (t) are controlled by the threaded rods, by steel strips (z) and rivets or nut-bolts. These frames (t) are attached to nuts which fit on threaded rods or jackets (y). as the threaded rods (y) are turned, the nuts move to and fro (backward and forward) pushing steel strips, which push the sliding inner frames (t), towards or away from frames (a, b, c, d, e).<br>
All the threaded rods or jacks (y) are connected by a chain, so they all turn together, when handle (w) is turned. When the structure is in chair form, the inner frames are pulled in to make the width of chair to 24". When the chair is converted into bed, the threaded rods are turned and inner frames (t) are pushed away from frames (a, b, c, d and e). This pushing away of<br>
14<br><br>
the inner frames (t) makes the width of bed at around 36". Thus the chair is converted into 36" wide comfortable bed. inner frames can be driven to and fro electrically electrical motors ,hydrolically by hydrolic fourse ,or pnumaticaly by pnumatic fourse.<br>
iv.       Commode:<br>
As shown in figure 6 (a), 6(b) and 6(c), a pan is fitted below frame (c). This pan is connected to frame (c) by hinges (r) and controlling linkage (s). When controlling linkage (s) is pulled, the pan is lowered down. The pan gets lowered from the bed along with the cushion padding. The cushion padding can be separated from the pan, when the pan is to be used. By pushing the controlling linkage (s), the pan gets shifted back (without padding cover) to its position and is now ready for use. All these actions/functioning of different parts in reverse order will convert the bed back to the chair position. By winding the cable with the help of the gear box, linkage (a) is pulled towards the front legs (o) of the wheel chair and through linkages (f, g, h, i) the bed converts back into wheel chair.<br>
As shown in figures 7(a) to 7(d) two gear boxes (jl, j2) are fitted on wheel chair frame. Driving shaft (kl) in gear box (jl) is turned in one direction to lower the pan with cushion pad. When the pan is lowered, one end of the cushion pad support locks on to one end of linkage (s). Driving gear (k2) in gear box (j2) is turned into one direction to pull out cushion pad and support plate. This uncovers the bed pan. Now the driving gear (kl) in gear box (jl) is turned into opposite direction to push the uncovered pan back into position, for use. All the above mentioned actions, when done in a reverse order will help the pan and cover pad into its original position.<br>
15<br><br>
Now we will see how the patient is lifted up and off the bed for airing and changing of bed or bed sheet. With reference to figures 9(a) and 9(b) at rest position lower end of arm (a2) is resting on the hydraulic telescope (a4). When the hydraulic telescope (a4) is extended in length by pumping, the lower end of the arm (a2) is pushed upwards. The turning bar (al) turns the arms (a2) attached to turning bar (al). The upper end of the arm is pushed away from the bed. This in effect pulls and stretches the straps (a3) over the side guards (a7). As a result the patient's body is lifted up. The patient can be kept in this position for airing, cleaning, sponging, change of bed or putting bed pan under the patient. Both ends of the straps (a3) can be attached to turning bars (al) fitted on both sides of the bed and can be pulled and stretched over side guards (a7).<br>
As shown in figures 10(a) and 10(b), the turning arm (al) can be turned by handle (a6) or is turned by connecting it to a motor shaft. The turning bar \arm can be turned hydrolicaly by hydrolic fourse, pnumaticaly by pnumatic fourse.<br>
The frames and other components of the wheel chair can be manufactured by using metals like aluminum, stainless steel, copper, brass or its alloys. All the parts may be made from materials like rubber, plastic, nylon, Teflon, fiber or other synthetic material to reduce the weight of the bed. The wheelchair come bed of the present invention can be manufactured in various sizes suitable for different sizes of persons/patients.<br>
Advantages of the wheel chair of the present invention:<br>
1. The wheel chair of the present invention has number of frames which can change angles to form a complete bed position. These frames can also change angles to form an easy chair position for comfort.<br>
16<br><br>
