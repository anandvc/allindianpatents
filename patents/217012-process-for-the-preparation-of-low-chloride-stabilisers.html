				<td>Process for the preparation of low chloride stabilizers<br>
The present invention relates to a new work-up process for the preparation of a stabilizer mixture containing a low amount of chloride, which are suitable for stabilizing organic mate¬rials against oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation.<br>
U.S. 4,075,163 discloses the synthesis of tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)b[pheny!ene diphos-phonite (column 7, Table 1, compound 12) which is suitable for stabilising organic materials against oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation. This compound is commercially avai¬lable for example as Sand stab P-EPQ (RTM) from Clarinet, Switzerland.<br>
EP-A-0 633 287 discloses in Example 1 that this commercially available Sandostab P-EPQ (RTM) is a mixture of several components comprising a) 65 % by weight of tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)biphenylene diphosphonite, b) 15 % by weight of bis{2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-biphenylene monophosphonite, c) 13 parts by weight of tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phos¬phite, d) 1.5 parts by weight of 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenol, e) up to 1 % by weight of chloride [up to lO"OOO mg/kgj, f) up to 0.5 % by weight of volatiles, and g) 4 - 5 % by weight of the oxi¬dised tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)biphenylene diphosphonite.<br>
Phosphites and phosphonites are hydrolytically very labile (see Example 29 in U.S. Patent 4,075,163). Therefore, during the synthesis of Sandostab P-EPQ (RTM) the reaction mixture was never brought into contact with water. In the actual large scale production of Sandostab P-EPQ (RTM) the neutralizations of the remaining aluminums trichloride/pyridine/hydrochloric acid complex is done with gaseous ammonia (see comparative Example 2 in the instant application). However, some of the formed salts like for example ammonium chloride remain in the final product. These salt impurities may be the reason why the final stabilizer mixture is slightly turbid. A turbid stabilizer for polyolefin’s, however, induces some haze in polyolefin which is for some applications clearly undesired.<br>
The goal of the instant invention was therefore to find an Improved work-up process for the synthesis of Sandostab P-EPQ (RTM) containing a low amount of chloride and forming a product which is not turbid and does not induce any haze into synthetic polymers.<br><br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a stabilizer mix¬ture containing a low amount of chloride comprising a) 50 - 80 % by weight of a diphosphonite of the formula I<br><br>
and where the sum of the compounds of the formula I, II and III is not greater than 100 % by<br>
weight,<br>

Example 1: Preparation of crude chlorobenzene solution of stabiliser mixture (35 % w/w).<br>
In a 1.5 L jacketed glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser, a mixture of 90 g (0.584 mole) of biphenyl, 204 g (1.53 mole) of anhydrous aluminium chloride and 305 g (2.218 mole) of phosphorus trichloride was refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere with stirring at an internal temperature of 75°C for 6 hours, during which time hydrochloric acid gas was evolved and trapped with water in a scrubber tower. The reaction mixture was cooled and excess phosphorus trichloride was distilled off at an internal temperature of 63-65°C and reduced pressure of 400-180 mbar. The crude melt was cooled to 35°C and di¬luted with 220 g of chlorobenzene.<br>
This crude solution was added to a stirred solution of 482 g (2.334 mole) of 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol , 362 g (4.576 mole) of pyridine and 600 g of chlorobenzene in a 2.5 L jacketed glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser with external water cooling. The reaction is exothermic and the internal temperature was kept below SO^C. At end of the addition, the mixture was kept 3 hours at an internal temperature of 63-65°C. On standing, the reaction mixture separated into two phases. The lower complex phase was separated and the upper organic phase was diluted with 430 g of chlorobenzene which lead to 1"650 g of crude chlorobenzene solution (35 % w/w) comprising the stabiliser mixture.
