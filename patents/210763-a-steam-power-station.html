				<td>steam power station Â±n a  ground-based installation<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a steam power station, essentially consisting of a steam generator, of a turboset with condensation steam turbine and generator, of a water-cooled condenser and of a preheater plant heated by tapped steam.<br>
Prior art<br>
Power stations of this type are manufactured, as a rule, according to customer specification and site requirements and therefore involve long periods of time for project development, project planning and construction and high costs associated with this. Above all, in these power stations governed by customer specifications, the construction time is influenced by the fact that it is not possible to carry out as detailed preliminary engineering as possible and essential tasks, such as, for example, the component [sic] which should be machined as soon as possible, can be performed only after a delay.<br>
It is known per se to shorten the construction time by setting up power stations in an outdoor form of construction. However, this form of construction, in turn, entails a series of disadvantages in terms of its operation and its maintenance and repair. In this connection, DE 1426918 Al discloses the concept of a steam power station which is to be erected in a shortened construction time and with decreased investment costs and, at the same time, is to reduce said disadvantages. This concept is based essentially on the turhoset being arranged in an aisle between the steam generators and a gantry crane being mounted as<br><br>
the steam generators in order to make 11 easier to assemble these and also the turboset. Moreover, the principle of multi-purpose use is implemented in such a way that the holding structures of the steam generator or the coal bunker are equipped at the same time for receiving secondary plants and the gantry crane can operate both steam genera tor parts and current genera tor parts. The steam power station produced according to this concept is highly compact and is ga thered together on a narrow ground area, The essence of this solution is the reduction in the outlay in terms of construction. The advantages of a low area requirement and of a multi-purpose use of holding structures are achieved at the expense of a vertical arrangement of numerous plant parts, It is precisely this vertical arrangement of numerous plant parts, the assembly of which is made easier during the construction phase with the aid of the gantry crane installed at a high level, which, in the operating phase, rules out use of the crane for purposes of the necessary repair and maintenance of the same plant parts. After the construction phase, the range of use of this crane remains restricted essentially to the turboset, since it is deprived of access to the plant parts of  all   the  intermediate levels.<br>
Presentation of the invention.<br>
The invention is intended to remedy this. Proceeding<br>
from the prior art mentioned, the object on which the<br>
invention is based is to provide a steam power station<br>
which is distinguished by being highly maintenance and<br>
repair friendly. Furthermore, a steam power station is<br>
to	be	provided,    which   achieves    substantial<br>
standardization and can be erected at a multiplicity of possible sites.<br><br>
The invention thus proceeds from a steam power station, essentially consisting of a steam generator, of a turboset with condensation steam turbine and generator, of a water-cooled condenser, of a preheater plant heated by tapped steam and of a gantry crane and is distinguished in that all the components of a steam power station, including the fuel stockyard, are arranged at ground level and in an outdoor installation and the gantry crane covers an area in which the turboset, together with the condenser and the preheater plant with associated pumps, and also the transformers are  arranged.<br>
When the steam generator, the flue-gas cleaning system and the chimney are laid in series along a common flue-gas axis, the turboset is expediently arranged next to it in the immediate vicinity and is oriented parallel to it.<br>
If the fuel stockyard is a coal dump, it is appropriate to arrange it downwind behind the turboset and the steam generator, as seen in the main wind direction.<br>
The advantage of all these measures is to be seen, in particular, in that the standardization of the plant engineering and of the components reduces the investment costs to an appreciable extent. The ground area of the power station is formed by a clearly defined rectangle. This makes it possible to extend the plant at any desired point in time merely by such rectangles being lined up with one another. In this case, the highly comprehensive project engineering customary hitherto in plant extensions may be dispensed with. The power station blocks to be arranged next to one another are identical; only the access roads are to be adapted to a minimal extent. A further advantage is<br><br>
to be seen in the consistently implemented outdoor installation. The cost-intensive and time-consuming erection of buildings, such as, for example, a boiler and machine house, may thereby be dispensed with. A measure whereby the turboset, together with the condenser, the preheater plant with associated pumps and at least the station service transformers, are arranged in such a way that they can be covered by a gantry crane also defines a rectangular cross section for these components. The plant parts can thereby be arranged directly next to one another in the most confined space possible, without operation and maintenance being impaired. The crane can be utilized for maintenance and repair tasks. This arrangement also allows the shortest possible connections between the various plant parts, this, in turn, having an advantageous effect on assembly and maintenance.<br>
The expedient measure of arranging the coal dump downwind behind the turboset and the steam generator is in no way detrimental to the requirement for a rectangular cross section of the plant and can be implemented independently of the wind direction. Coal dust emissions in the region of the industrial plants and of the administration operations can be avoided in this way. In any event, the desired rectangular cross section can also be implemented with respect to the local situation of the body of water necessary for cooling purposes. The respective situation plan, of course, takes this water situation into account, and, here too, importance is attached to the shortest possible connecting paths.<br>
A, flat-bed pick-up installed at ground level is provided for feeding the unground coal onto the inclined conveyor to the coal breaker. This makes it<br><br>
possible to dispense with the hitherto conventional large-volume and deep concreted-in underground pick-up pit, thus considerably reducing the civil engineering work.<br>
The steam generator is preferably supplied with coarse-ground coal from coal silos. It is expedient, in this case, if the coal silos assigned to the steam generator, together with the preceding coal breaker, are connected via an at least approximately horizontally running conveying device with a following vertical conveying device. By the horizontally running conveying device being installed at ground level, complicated steel structures can be avoided.<br>
The steam turbine has an axial outlet, with the result that the steam condenser is located in the axial prolongation of the steam turbine. This solution, which is appropriate by virtue of the turbos et being installed virtually at ground level and the fact of outdoor installation, allows unrestricted access to the condenser, When condenser tubes have to be exchanged, it is no longer necessary, as hitherto, to remove fagade elements of a building. Moreover, the gantry crane covering the condenser can be used for maintenance tasks of this kind.<br>
It is advantageous if all the preheaters are designed for the same pressure on the water side, have essentially the same dimensions and are arranged next to the turboset. This measure ensures the shortest possible connections on the water side and steam side and likewise makes it possible to utilize the gantry crane for maintenance tasksâ¢<br>
On the basis of the recognition that the construction time   of   a   power   station   nowadays   is   extremely   long   on<br><br>
account of the lack of preliminary planning and adaptation to customer specifications, the invention is conducive to substantial standardization of a power station which can be erected at a multiplicity of possible  sites.<br>
Brief description of the drawing<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing with reference to a single-shaft axial-throughflow turboset with coal as the primary fuel. Only the elements essential for understanding the invention are shown. Other parts of the plant, for example, the numerous lines between the machines and apparatuses and most shut-off and regulating fittings etc., are not illustrated. The direction of flow of the various working media is illustrated by arrows. In the drawing:<br>

surroundings; Fig. 4  shows the transport path of the coal from the<br>

different situation of the body of water.<br>
Way of implementing the invention<br>
According to Fig. 1, a plant module, which contains all the power station components,  is designated by 200.<br><br>
Such a iTiodule could comprise, for example, a 150 MV! plant and is advantageously erected in a purely industrial zone, in order to protect residents against emissions, such as dust, noise and heavy-goods traffic. The fuel stockyard is designated by 6. In the present case, this is an open coal store of rectangular base area. In the example shown, the coal dump is directly adjacent to a river 20, which means that the coal could be delivered by ship. This may, of course, also be carried out by rail or by means of heavy-goods vehicles via access roads 36. Transport via conveyor belts would also be possible, if the plant were located in the vicinity of a coal mine.<br>
Starting from this coal dump 6, the main wind directions 9 then determine the basic orientation of<br>
the power station elements.<br>
The coal is first poured from the dump 5, by means of a tractor shovel 49, which may also be utilized for excavation work during the erection phase, onto a flatÂ¬bed pick-up 10 (Fig. 4). The piled-up batch material 41 passes from there onto the inclined conveyor 11 leading to the (coal breaker (20)" [sic]. As already mentioned in the introd"uction, the pick-up 10 makes it possible to dispense with a concreted-in pit, into which the coal is led onto a conveyor belt via funnels. Since the pick-up 10 is located at ground level on a foundation slab, the new measure also achieves, as compared with the pit solution, a reduction in the length of the inclined conveyor 11 which has to convey onto the normally about 15-20 m high inlet of the breaker building 12.<br>
From the coal breaker, the batch material passes first via a horizontal conveying device lA    and then via a<br><br>
vertical conveying device 15 onto a horizontal conveyor 43, from which it is introduced into the coal silos 13. This solution has some advantages, as compared with the hitherto conventional conveyance to the silos by inclined conveyor. Since the charging of conventional boiler silos is, as a rule, at a height of 50 m, a length of almost 200 m is required for conveyance by an inclined conveyor having a conventional inclination of 14""-15Â°. This length can be drastically reduced by Tieans of the present new measure, so that the coal Dreaker ^20 â  [sic] can be arranged in very close proximity to the boiler. Furthermore, the horizontal conveying device 14 can be set up at ground level on simple concrete sleepers. Extensive steel structures, such as in the case of conveyance by inclined conveyor, which, moreover, require a high crane capacity during assembly, can be dispensed with. It goes without saying that access to a horizontal conveyor belt running at ground level also becomes easier because of the absence of operating aisles and gangways.<br>
Furthermore,  this design,  first horizontal  and then_<br>
vertical, allows the fundamental standardization of the following vertical conveying device 15. This is an encased bucket elevator with a simple carrying structure, which is likewise installed at ground level and is preferably connected to the boiler structure for picking up horizontal loads. The result of all this is that only the length of the horizontal conveying device 14 has to be adapted in each case to different situations, that is to say the distance from the coal dump to the boiler.<br>
The steam generator 1 operates with atmospheric fluidized"bed firing. In this case, coarsely broken coal with a lump size of about 6 mm can be burnt. The<br><br>
advantage is to be seen in that apart from the coal breaker QO J[sÂ±c] no additional coal mill is required. The steam generator is held in a steel frame; external cladding and roofing over can be dispensed with.<br>
As is evident from Fig. 1, the steam generator is directly preceded by a tank 2 4 for liquid fuel. This liquid fuel is required for starting up the steam generator and for the stoking fire. The site of this tank is selected with a view to short conveying paths. The tank itself is accommodated in a concreted collecting basin. The pumps 25 for the start-up fuel are located directly next to the tank 24 on pedestals which project from a concrete foundation slab. In this case, this foundation slab is designed as a collecting basin for the pump region.<br>
The tank can be filled from the road 36 by means of tankers. It became clear that a favourable solution was to utilize the pumps 25 for the start-up fuel both for feeding the burners and for filling the tank. How this can be implemented is shown in Fig. 7. For filling the tank, the pump 25 sucks fuel out of the tanker via a correspondingly set three-way member 47 and conveys it [sic] by way of a filling line 48 into the container via a further correspondingly set three-way member 46. To start up the steam generator and for the stoking fire, the pump 25 conveys the fuel out of the tank 24 to the burners 45 of the boiler 1 via the again correspondingly set three-way members 47 and 46.<br>
Since the steam generator 1 operates with atmospheric fluidized-bed firing, there is no need for desulphuration of the flue gases. Consequently, the boiler is followed directly by the flue-gas cleaning system   16   which   consists   essentially   of   an<br><br>
electrostatic separator or of a fabric filter. The cleaned exhaust gases are discharged in the atmosphere via the chimney 17. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the steam generator 1, the flue-gas cleaning system 16 and the chimney 11 are arranged in the longitudinal axis of the boiler along a so-called flue-gas axis 18.<br>
The machine axis 33 then runs parallel to this flue-gas axis 18. Along this axis are arranged the turboset 2, 3 and the condenser 4 and also the transformers 7 and preferably the outdoor switching station 34. The difference from conventional plants, in which the turboset is located, as a rule, on the end face of the steam generator 1, can be seen here.<br>
What can also be seen in the module 200 is the road system 36 which gives access to the plant, a workshop 31 and a switching station building 32 and also the cooling-tower plant 35, the make-up water system 19 leading to it and the water treatment system 30. In order to keep the pipelines short, the aim is for the cooling-tower plant to be as near as possible to the condenser 4. An above-ground arrangement is selected for these pipelines, so as not to obstruct the construction work at the time when the plant is erected. The cooling cells lined up with one another are oriented as a function both of the prevailing wind direction and of the distance to the turbine and the boiler; it is important, in this case, not to impair the ventilation of the cooling towers.<br>
The extraction of the make-up water is carried out without the comprehensive intake assemblies conventional hitherto. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the make-up water is conveyed in the simplest way via a dirty-water pump 22. In the present example, this pump<br><br>
is arranged in a concrete tube 21 submerged in the body of water 20. The concrete tube consists preferably of individual rings which are stacked one on top of the other and at least one of which is provided with inlet orifices 44. The tube 21 and the pump 22 stand on a thin concrete slab embedded in the river bottom. The water extraction station can be negotiated via a catwalk 37. The water pipes 19 run near the ground and are supported on sleepers 3 8.<br>
As far as possible, mechanical and electrical accessories are prefabricated and preassembled and are brought into the plant in transport containers. During assembly, the containers are placed on simple concrete sleepers by means of a crane. Both the adaptive engineering and the assembly time can consequently be reduced. This also applies to the entire lubricating-oil and control-oil system together with the oil tank and pumps which are delivered, preassembled, and are accommodated directly next to the turboset in a concrete collecting basin.<br>
Figure 2 shows a triple arrangement of modules 200, with the same wind direction and the same river course as in Fig. 1. The only difference from the plant according to Fig. 1 is to be seen in the continuous stretches of roads 36. It can thus be seen that a plant can be extended at any desired point in time without detriment to the operation of the already existing modules. If it is already clear, before the erection of a power plant, that it will consist of a plurality of modules, then, of course, there will be deliberations as to a common coal dump and a common cooling-water extraction station.<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows those elements which, according to the invention, are covered by a gantry crane 8. At the right-hand margin of the figure the flue-gas axis 18 with the elements comprising the pumps 25 for start-up fuel, coal silos 13, steam generator 1 and flue-gas cleaning system 16 is illustrated. The fact that the plant manages without buildings and that the preheaters are arranged on the side facing away from the boiler, as described later, results, in this case, in that the actual turbine 2 can be installed in the immediate vicinity of the boiler 1, thus making it possible to have extremely short connecting lines which are not illustrated in this figure. This applies particularly to the fresh-steam line.<br>
The crane rails 39 of the gantry crane 8 are supported on both sides on concrete columns 40, with the result that the leadthrough of steam lines, water lines and cable ducts is not impeded. The length of the crane rails is dimensioned such that they also include the station service transformer 7 and the feed-pump block 2 6 which are both arranged along the machine axis 33. The crane width is selected such that the crane (8) can also serve the preheater system 5 and the switching station building 32 produced in a container design. This expresses the fact that this crane (S) is also used for the initial erection of the plant, with the result that mobile lifting appliances can be dispensed with. The carrying force of the crane is accordingly designed for the heaviest turbine parts which are to be moved at the time of assembly. This does not apply to the generator 3 which is preferably brought into its operating position via sliding rails.<br>
The advantage of the ground-level installation of all the elements mentioned and of the operation of these by<br><br>
means of a gantry crane is not to be underestimated. This is because it is precisely in those market segments which, inter alia, for climatic reasons allow an outdoor installation of the plant that mobile cranes with a sufficient rating and carrying force are often not available. This applies particularly to an unplanned breakdown of the plant which is to be remedied immediately.<br>
Where the actual machine is concerned, consisting here of a steam turbine with a high-pressure part 2A, a medium-pressure part 2B and a low-pressure part 2C and also the generator 3, the term "ground-level" must be understood relatively. In actual fact, the installation is virtually at ground level, which is supposed to mean that it is not a structure in which the machine is placed on a foundation platform which, in turn, is carried by steel or concrete columnsâ¢ This virtually ground-level installation of the machine is made possible by the fact that the exhaust steam frorn the low-pressure turbine 2C is oriented axially and that the condenser neck of the condenser 4 lying at the same level is flanged to the exhaust steam. This design makes it possible for the machine axis 33 to come to lie only about 5.5 m above the ground. This dispenses with the conventional service platform around the machine and with any intermediate floors. Platforms with corresponding flights of stairs are provided only where access for service personnel and for maintenance purposes is absolutely necessary.<br>
The turboset 2, 3, together with the condenser 4, rests on a simple monolithic concrete foundation slab, column slabs which project from the foundation supporting the bearings and the housings. The abovementioned platforms<br><br>
required are located at a height of about 4.5 m above the ground. The oil lines are laid on them.<br>
On account of the outdoor installation, the turbine housings are equipped with weatherproof claddings having correspondingly designed ventilation orifices. These claddings are likewise supported on the platforms mentioned.<br>
All the turbine housings are provided with a horizontal parting plane, and at least all the steam tapping points (110 in Fig. 5) are arranged on the lower housing half in each case. These lines therefore do not have to be removed in order to cover the upper housing halves, as is necessary during maintenance tasks on the bladings or on the rotor. Laying the lines at a low level above the ground as a result of this also has the advantage that the supports of the pipes can be designed in a simple way and uncomplicated setting-up can be provided as early as at the time of initial assembly. Moreover, access is simplified in the case of welding tasks, tests and insulating work which are to be carried out.<br>
Guiding the tapped-steam lines near the ground then also suggests arranging the feed-water preheaters 5 accordingly. They are arranged directly next to the turbine. In the example of a 150 MW plant, the preheater system consists of five apparatuses which are arranged next to one another. It goes without saying that they may lie partially one above the other, without deviating from the basic idea of the ground-level arrangement, for example 3 preheaters on the ground and 2 preheaters lying above them. It is critical merely that they can be operated from the gantry crane 8. The selected arrangement next to the<br><br>
turbine 2 has the effect of short tapped-steam lines. The fact that they do not lie on the boiler side, but on the opposite side, has the advantage of disentangling the tapped-steam lines and the steam lines leading to the steam generator. Moreover, installing the preheaters near the ground makes it possible to have simple supports in the form of concrete plinths which likewise carry the feed-water lines and the tapped-steam lines.<br>
All the preheaters 5 have essentially the same dimensions and are designed for the same pressure on the water side. This already indicates that the water/steam circuit is designed so that it manages without a feed-water tank/aerator. This large and heavy apparatus, conventional per se, is arranged, as a rule, at a height of about 15m and requires correspondingly costly supports. The omission of this tank and of the corresponding line routing leads to a considerable reduction in the investment costs and the assembly time.<br>
The water/steam circuit is illustrated in simplified form in the heat-flow diagram of Fig. 5 and is explained briefly below. The feed water enters the economizer 101 of the steam generator 1 under conventional conditions (170 bar, approximately 250Â°C) and passes from there into the steam drum 103. In natural circulation, the water is led through the evaporator 102 and as saturated steam back into the drum. In the multi-part (not illustrated) superheater 104, it is heated to its final temperature of 540Â°C and is introduced via the fresh-steam line 105 into the high-pressure part 2A of the steam turbine. The steam expands in this, at the same time delivering a power output,  to  a pressure  of  approximately  40 bar.  The<br><br>
steam passes via the cold intermediate superheater line 106 back into the boiler, is heated once again there to approximately S40Â° in the intermediate superheater and is introduced via the hot intermediate superheater line 108 into the medium-pressure part 2B of the steam turbine. After renewed partial expansion, the steam passes from the medium-pressure part into the low-pressure part 2C, in which it is expanded to condenser pressure. The steam is precipitated in the water-cooled condenser 4, and the condensate collects in the hotwell (not illustrated) from where it is conveyed into the preheater system by means of the condensate pump 111. Plants are thus far sufficiently known.<br>
The following concept was then selected in order to simplify the preheater system. The feed pump 26 is of two-stage design. On the water side, a prepump 27 is arranged upstream of the preheaters 5 and a main pump 2 8 is arranged downstream of the preheaters. The two-stage feed pump is provided with a common drive 29. In the preheaters, the feed water is heated to the boiler inlet temperature by means of tapped steam which is extracted from corresponding stages of the turbines 2A-2C via the tapping lines 110. The two-stage design of the feed pump has the advantage that all the preheaters can be designed for the same low pressure on the water side and can therefore be manufactured cost-effectively. The final pressure of the prepump 27 is selected as a function of the pressure loss within the preheater section and of the permissible inlet pressure of the main pump 29.<br>
As a special feature, a compensating tank 23 for cold condensate is provided in the preheater section between the condensate pump 111 and the feed pump 27. This tank can operate with a pressure cushion in the form of<br><br>
steam or of inert gas and serves as a reservoir for the feed pump 27. This tank begins to function particularly in non-stationary operating states,<br><br>
cooling water for generator cooling, the intermediate cooling system required for other purposes, and which operates with treated water, can be dimensioned smaller<br>
and therefore less costly.<br>
Since the generator axis is also at a height of about 5.5 m above the ground, this affords the possibility of arranging the generator switches and exciting equipment (not illustrated) below the generator. They can be placed on a simple concrete slab. The generator outgoing lines are consequently arranged on the underside of the generator and run in a row, thus resulting in the shortest possible line lengths. This solution avoids complicated carrying structures, such as are known from the lateral outlet of the outgoing lines above the generator.<br>
The installation of the transformers 7 in close proximity to the generator 4 can be seen from Fig. 1 and 3, thus resulting in short busbars 50. The station service  transformer  and  the  block  transformers  are<br><br>
service transformer and the block transformers are separated from one another by a fire protection wall. The plant is designed in such a way that at least the station service transformer can be operated from the gantry crane.<br>
The switching station 34 may be designed as a gas-insulated high-voltage module, with the result that, on the one hand, the land requirement is reduced considerably and, on the other hand, the switching station can be set up very near to the transformer station. The switching stations and the control room are likewise designed as containers. The modules are placed, prefabricated, onto a ground-level foundation slab with a peripheral plinth by means of a gantry crane. The space thus obtained serves as a cable gully.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show the selected basic layout in the case of a different wind direction, on the one hand, and in the case of a different course of the body of water, on the other hand. According to the stipulation, in both arrangements, the coal dump 6 is arranged in each case downwind. These figures reveal the great advantage of the coal-conveying concept. Only the length and run of the horizontal conveyor 14 have to be adapted to the new conditions. The plant in Fig. 9 differs from that in Fig. 8 in a different course of the river 20. The water eKtraction which has to be designed differently results merely in a different geometry of the module 200.<br><br>
