Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to computer-aided design<br>
documents, and more particularly to display ordering of elements in a two-<br>
dimensional computer aided design document.<br>
Related Art<br>
[0002]	Computer-aided design (CAD) drawings prepared by architects, engineers,<br>
designers, planners, and the like require large amounts of data to be stored in files.<br>
CAD software includes an API to access the large quantities of data. Applications<br>
such as, e.g., MicroStation® products, which are developed by Bentley Systems, Inc.,<br>
Exton, Pennsylvania U.S.A. are typical of such CAD software, which may be used in<br>
the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) marketplace.<br>
[0003]	A typical CAD project employed in the engineering context is stored in<br>
numerous files. Each file typically contains one or more engineering models, each of<br>
which typically represents an engineering domain (e.g., structural, electrical,<br>
mechanical, plumbing). Moreover, each engineering model contains numerous<br>
elements that collectively represent the complex and precise nature of each design.<br>
Each item in a model is represented by at least one element or an aggregation of<br><br>
elements. For example, a structural drawing can hold the column and beam layout for<br>
a floor plan, which are internally represented by lines, squares and rectangles and<br>
additional properties. In this example, an individual beam element may be a<br>
collection of lines, squares and rectangles. The structure of the floor plan may be<br>
more complex and require many levels of elements to accurately provide a structural<br>
representation.<br>
[0004]	In known CAD software, the last element added to a two dimensional<br>
design image is usually displayed on top of other existing elements. That is, the last<br>
element added obscures any previously drawn element if both elements occupy the<br>
same two-dimensional space in the image. This is commonly referred to as the<br>
painter's algorithm. As in painting, the last paint applied to a surface obscures<br>
previously applied paint. The painter's algorithm defines the overlay of the elements<br>
in the image according to the sequence in which the elements are drawn.<br>
[0005]	Many CAD and other graphics programs allow the user to reorder<br>
elements. The user may select an element and perform a "send-to-back" or "bring-to-<br>
front" process on the element. These processes reorder the sequence in which the<br>
elements are drawn. The reordering therefore changes the visibility of the element<br>
relative to the other elements in that particular image. This resequencing can either<br>
be accomplished by physically reordering the elements in memory or by keeping a<br>
separate "sort order" list.<br>
[0006]	The above approach works fine for specifying the relative order of specific<br>
elements (e.g. this one is in front of that one), but provides no systematic way for<br>
users to specify relative priorities for types or groups of elements. Also, with the<br><br>
painter's algorithm, maintaining proper sequencing of dements in the face of changes<br>
is difficult For example, when making a copy of an element, there is no predictable<br>
way for the user to specify the relative priority of the new element with respect to the<br>
old element, or other elements in the same vicinity. Typically, if the user wishes to<br>
copy an clement and use it elsewhere in the image or in another image, the copied<br>
element is placed at the end of the list, and therefore on top of all other elements. A<br>
reordering operation must be performed to move the element to the desired position.<br>
Similarly, if a user has a preference about a certain type of element, such as a text<br>
label, the user typically has to remember to place that element at the appropriate<br>
moment in the image construction. Otherwise the user must re-order each instance of<br>
the dement type.<br>
[0007]	Furthermore, some CAD programs provide a Level (sometimes referred to<br>
as a "Layer") system whereby the image can be built from elements on a collection of<br>
Levels, For example, in an architectural drawing, the structural, electrical and<br>
plumbing disciplines might each have their own set of Levels in the image. Users can<br>
then view a limited subset of the Levels in order to reduce complexity. Since Level is<br>
typically implemented as an attribute of an Element, Level does not participate in<br>
display ordering. However, the user may wish to sort the display of Elements based<br>
on Level such that all elements on one Level appear in front of all Elements on<br>
another Level.<br><br>
US 2002/0171671 discloses a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for<br>
automating a draw order of entities output from a computer. A drawing output from a<br>
computer (e.g., on a display device) is obtained by a drawing program and examined to<br>
identify two or more entities that overlap/intersect. The drawing program then<br>
automatically determines the drawing order for the two or more entities based on a set of<br>
one or more predefined rules.<br>
US 2004/0075688 discloses a system and method providing an optimal way to create,<br>
manage and use resource data is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the system and<br>
method provide the ability to store resource data in a library, namely a resource library. A<br>
resource library includes resource files that can be attached to a regular data file either<br>
automatically, for example, by setting an environment variable, or manually. More than<br>
one resource library or resource file may be created and simultaneously attached to a data<br>
file. The resource file defines attributes of elements that may be used in creating the CAD<br>
model. Typically, the resource library includes attributes that are to be standardized across<br>
a project, file, or model.<br>
US 7,418,668 discloses a method for changing a color value and/or level of opacity value<br>
of a glass appearance window frame for an application window is described. The method<br>
includes steps of determining a defined color value and a defined level of opacity value to<br>
apply to a glass appearance window frame and displaying the glass appearance window<br>
frame in accordance with the defined color value and the defined level of opacity value. A<br>
command may be received to apply the defined color value and the defined level of<br>
opacity<br><br>
value to the glass appearance window frame, thereby applying the defined color value and<br>
level of opacity value to the glass appearance window frame. Color values and/or level of<br>
opacity values may be changed automatically, be application specific, and/or be changed<br>
in response to receipt of an input from a user to change one or more portions of a default<br>
configuration.<br>
US 5,325,485 discloses a method and system for processing a graphics data stream in a<br>
computer graphics system having a parallel processing system. The graphics data stream<br>
includes a plurality of elements. The method and system of the present invention involve<br>
associating tags with elements in a graphics data stream, wherein each tag indicates a<br>
display order for the element associated with the tag. The elements are processed within a<br>
parallel processing system to produce processed elements, wherein each of the processed<br>
elements maintains an association with a tag. The processed elements are rasterized in a<br>
selected sequence to determine new pixel data sets, wherein rasterization of each<br>
processed element results in a new pixel data set for each of a plurality of pixels. Each<br>
new pixel data set includes order data derived from a tag associated with each of the<br>
processed elements. For each new pixel data set resulting from the rasterization of the<br>
processed elements, a current pixel data set is determined in response to a comparison of<br>
order data in the new pixel data set with order data in an existing pixel data set for each of<br>
the pixels. The pixels are then displayed within a display device utilizing the current pixel<br>
data sets associated with each of the pixels, wherein the plurality of elements is displayed<br>
in an order indicated by the associated tags to form a image.<br><br>
US 5,454,073 discloses a drawing management device for managing the drawing of an<br>
entire facility, such as a water supply facility, as digital information. This device includes<br>
a unit for storing drawings with priorities obtained by separating die entire facility<br>
drawing into sub-facility drawings located at plural levels, a selective display designating<br>
unit for displaying a desired sub-facility drawing obtained by selecting the number of<br>
levels considering the priority from the storing unit, and a display unit for displaying the<br>
desired sub-facility drawing in response to the signal from the selective display<br>
designating unit. By suitably selecting a desired level considering the priority, only a<br>
necessary and sufficient facility drawing can be displayed swiftly.<br>

Dimension can be extremely useful when explaining a chronological sequence of events,<br>
such as in the reconstruction of a vehicle accident, where the dynamic movement of the<br>
vehicles involved may be dependent on complicated and difficult to explain engineering<br>
or mathematical principles. Viewport is defined as a rectangular region in screen<br>
coordinates into which the world-coordinate window is to be mapped.<br>
[0008]	Accordingly, there is a need for an improved method and system for<br>
setting display priority that overcomes shortcomings of conventional solutions.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0009]	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a system, method<br>
and computer program product for determining a display priority in two-dimensional<br>
CAD images is disclosed.<br>
[00010]	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, three values for<br>
each CAD element are available: an element priority, a level priority, and a model<br>
reference priority. In addition, for the CAD project that contains the CAD image<br>
element, a separate priority multiplier value may be set project-wide for elements,<br>
levels, and model references, creating an element priority multiplier, a level priority<br>
multiplier, and a model reference priority multiplier. Once the priority values and<br>
priority multiplier values have been set, either by default values or by the user, the<br>
values are used to calculate an image depth for each CAD image element. The image<br>
depth values are used, for example in a z-buffer, and determine the relative display<br>
priority for the CAD image elements regardless of the order in which they are placed<br>
into the image.<br>
[00011]	In another embodiment of the invention, a system for setting an image<br>
depth in a two-dimensional CAD image is provided. The system includes means for<br>
setting each of an element priority multiplier value, a level priority multiplier value,<br>
and a model reference priority multiplier value for a CAD project containing at least<br>
one two dimensional CAD image, wherein the CAD image includes a plurality of<br>
CAD image elements; means for setting each of an element priority value for each<br>
CAD image element, a level priority value for each Level, and a model reference<br>
priority value for each Model Reference; means for determining an image depth for<br><br>
the CAD image element based on a combination of the element priority value, level<br>
priority value, model reference priority value, element priority multiplier value, level<br>
priority multiplier value, and model reference priority multiplier value; and means for<br>
using the image depth to position the CAD image element relative to other CAD<br>
image elements in the CAD image.<br>
[00012]	According to an exemplary method, element priority values for a plurality<br>
- of elements are defined. The element priority values are stored as attributes of the<br>
respective elements. At least two of the elements are placed in an image. A<br>
precedence of the elements in the image is determined based on a mathematical<br>
combination of the element, level, and model reference priority values and the<br>
element, level, and model reference priority multiplier values.<br>
[00013]	Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure<br>
and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below<br>

Detailed Description of an Exemplary Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
[00026]	A preferred embodiment of the invention is discussed in detail below.<br>
While specific exemplary embodiments are discussed, it should be understood that<br>
this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will<br>
recognize that other elements and configurations can be used without parting from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
[00027]	An exemplary embodiment of the present invention operates on a<br>
computer system having a display and an input device, and can be part of, or<br>
cooperative with, CAD software or CAD drawing display software. The computer<br>
system can be stand-alone or networked to other computer systems. The CAD images<br>
and software can be stored on the computer readable media of the computer system or<br>
on a computer system on a network.<br>
[00028]	A display priority value may be used to determine the relative precedence<br>
of elements in a CAD image as they are displayed. The display priority value may be<br>
based on attributes of an element and other criteria. A Z-buffering approach based on<br>
the display priority value may be used to achieve relative precedence among elements<br>
in a CAD image. This approach has the advantage that it does not depend on the order<br>
in which elements are drawn. Also, groups of elements (e.g. a "level" or "layer", or<br>
"model" in CAD terminology) may have associated priority values. The element<br>
priority attributes of an element, the level priority of its level, and the model reference<br><br>
priority of its model reference may be combined to determine the display priority for<br>
an element. This provides additional predictable control of element display priority.<br>
[00029]	FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a two-dimensional CAD<br>
image 102 having three elements: a star 104, a square 106 and a circle 108. The x-<br>
axis is shown with line 110, and the y-axis is shown with line 112. It is important to<br>
note that since the image is purposely two-dimensional, there is no z-axis values<br>
stored on the elements. However, for purpose of presentation, it is desired to control<br>
the relative precedence (front-to-back positions) of the elements in the image. One<br>
approach would be to convert the elements to three-dimensions and store a z value for<br>
each element. But that has many undesirable side effects and is often unacceptable.<br>
Rather than converting the elements to three-dimensions to accomplish the relative<br>
precedence, a display priority is computed at display time for each element. The<br>
display priority may be computed based on attributes of the elements. The display<br>
priority may be computed as a mathematical function or by an algorithm implemented<br>
by a computer function. The computer function may be computer readable code,<br>
such as software.<br>
[00030]	In FIG. 1, the star 104 has the lowest computed display priority.<br>
Accordingly, the star 104 is displayed behind and obscured by both of the square 106<br>
and circle 108. The square 106 has the next lowest computed display priority. The<br>
square 106 is therefore on top of the star 104 but beneath the circle 108. The circle<br>
108 is the element in the drawing that has the highest computed display priority. The<br>
circle 108 is thus displayed on top of both the star 104 and square 106.<br><br>
[00031]	Referring now to FIG. 2, a hypothetical, stylized, exploded view of the<br>
two dimensional CAD image 102 of FIG. 1 is illustrated. FIG. 2 shows the computed<br>
display priority values along a third axis 202. The ordering of the star 104, square<br>
106, and circle 108 along the display priority axis is also shown. The relative<br>
positions of the elements with respect to the display priority axis are shown with line<br>
204 for the star 104, line 206 for the square 106, and line 208 for the circle 108.<br>
[00032]	As mentioned above, the element priority attributes of an element, the<br>
level priority of its level, and the model reference priority of its model reference may<br>
be combined to determine the display priority for an element. The element priority<br>
for an element can be defined by a user via an input device or set by default. The<br>
element priority is treated as an attribute of its respective element. When an element<br>
is created, its element priority is determined along with the element's other attributes,<br>
such as color, line width, etc. Defining element display priority as an attribute of an<br>
element provides the user a way to define the element display priority of an element<br>
as they are copied.<br>
[00033]	Additionally, a user can specify a priority for groups of elements. As<br>
mentioned above, a CAD image can be made up of multiple levels. A level typically<br>
includes logically related elements and can contain one or more elements. Each level<br>
may be assigned a level priority. Accordingly users can specify an order of<br>
appearance in the depth of the image for different levels.<br>
[00034]	A CAD project is typically comprised of multiple models. A model is a<br>
higher level logical grouping of content than a level (models contain levels). A<br>
model is typically used to subdivide a project into smaller, individually editable,<br><br>
pieces. A model can be stored in a single CAD file or, as in MicroStation V8 DGN<br>
files, a single CAD file can contain multiple models. A CAD image can be comprised<br>
of references to multiple models (sometimes called an "XREF"). In fact, the same<br>
model may be referenced more than one time at different sizes, orientations, and<br>
positions through multiple model references. Each model reference can be assigned a<br>
model reference display priority.<br>
[00035]	For every element in a CAD image, an element priority, level priority and<br>
model reference priority may be determined. These three priorities may be combined<br>
using different combining weights to determine the final display priority for an<br>
element. The element is displayed in the image according to its computed display<br>
priority and not according to the sequence in which the element is drawn. For<br>
example, in the illustration shown in Fig. 1, circle 108 may be drawn before star 104.<br>
However, since circle 108 has a higher computed display priority, it is displayed on<br>
top of star 104. Thus no matter what order the elements are draw in the image, the<br>
elements are displayed according to their computed display priority. When two<br>
elements have identical computed display priority values, generally the last one<br>
drawn appears on top, as in the painter's algorithm.<br>
[00036]	FIGS. 3 and 4 depict flow charts of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
method according to the present invention. The method determines display priorities<br>
for elements in an image based on the element priority, level priority and model<br>
reference priority described above. The display priorities for the elements may also<br>
be calculated based on other attributes of an element or its context. For example, the<br>
view type, cost, creation time, author may be used in determining display priority.<br><br>
[00037]	When a CAD project is created per block 302, or later on during the<br>
design stages, a combining weight, such as an element priority multiplier 330, a<br>
model reference priority multiplier 331, and a level priority multiplier 332, for each<br>
of the three priorities may set per block 304. The multipliers are constant for a CAD<br>
image and may apply to the project as a whole. The combining weight may be a<br>
constant value which is combined in some manner with its associated priority. The<br>
combining weight may be used to determine the relative influence of each of the<br>
individual priorities in determining a display priority for that element.<br>
[00038]	The multipliers 330,331, and 332 determine the relative impact of each<br>
priority value. For example, if the user does not want to use level priority at all in<br>
determining display priority, the level priority multiplier 332 may be set to zero.<br>
[00039]	The default element priority 333, level priority 334, model reference<br>
priority 335 may also be set, block 306. These default priorities may be predefined<br>
for a project. The multipliers and the default priorities for the element, level, and<br>
model reference may by set by a project manager or administrator. Typically, the<br>
CAD image is created according to defined drafting standards. The drafting<br>
standards may be defined in a settings file in the CAD software. The administrator<br>
may set the multipliers and default priorities based on project wide rules for what is to<br>
be displayed with the highest priority. A user may also be permitted to set or modify<br>
the multipliers and priorities.<br>
[00040]	At display time, an order of precedence for the elements in a CAD image<br>
may be determined, block 408. The display priority for each element in the CAD<br>
image to be displayed may be used to determine the order of precedence. To<br><br>
determine the display priority for an image, first the element priority multiplier, level<br>
priority multiplier and model reference multiplier for an element are determined,<br>
block 410. The multipliers are constant for all of the elements the CAD image. The<br>
multipliers may also be constant for an entire project.<br>
[00041 ]	In block 412, it is determined whether there are more elements in the<br>
image for which a display priority needs to be computed. If there are elements for<br>
which a display priority needs to be computed, the process proceeds to block 414.<br>
Per block 414, the next element is retrieved from the CAD file.<br>
[00042]	The element priority for that element is determined, per block 416. As<br>
mentioned above the element priority may be an attribute of the element. Thus, the<br>
attributes of the element may be examined to determine the element priority.<br>
[00043]	In block 418, the level priority for the element is determined. The level<br>
priority depends the level of the element. The level may be an attribute of the<br>
element and can be obtained by examining the attributes of the element. Once the<br>
level of the element is determined, the level priority for that level may be determined.<br>
For example, this may be done using a mapping process that maps a level with a level<br>
priority.<br>
[00044]	A model reference priority for the element is determined, per block 420.<br>
This may be done using a mapping process that maps a model reference for the<br>
element with a model reference priority value.<br>
[00045]	The display priority for the element is then computed, block 422. The<br>
display priority may be a function of the element priority, level priority, and model<br><br>
reference priority. For example, the element priority multiplier 330, model reference<br>
priority multiplier 331, level priority multiplier 332, element priority 333, model<br>
reference priority 334, and level priority 335 of an element may be combined to<br>
determine a display priority for that element. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
display priority can be determined from the following equation:<br><br>
' where PD is the display priority, Pelement is the element priority, celement is the element<br>
priority multiplier, Plevel is the level priority, Clevel is the level priority multiplier, Pmodel<br>
is the model reference priority, and cmodel is the model reference priority multiplier.<br>
Generally, PD = f(Pelement, Plevel, Pmodel )• Other attributes and the context of the<br>
element may also be used in the function.<br>
[00046]	Once the display priority for the element is computed, the element can be .<br>
displayed, block 424. The element is displayed in the CAD image using its display<br>
priority to order the element in the image depth. The process may then return to<br>
 block 412 and may be repeated for each element in the CAD image until there are no<br>
more elements that need a display priority computed. The process in then complete,<br>
block 426.	<br>
[00047] In an exemplary embodiment, a z-buffer may be used to store the display priorities<br>
 | and/or the image depth of the CAD image elements. Known z-buffering techniques<br>
 may be used to display the elements based on the calculated display priorities. The<br>
 number of display priority levels is only limited by the size of the z-buffer. If the z-<br>
 buffer is 224 bits large, then default values, for the three constants can be, for<br>
 example, Celement = 1, Clevel = 256, Cmodel = 65536.<br><br>

above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only,<br>
and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be<br>
limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should instead be<br>
