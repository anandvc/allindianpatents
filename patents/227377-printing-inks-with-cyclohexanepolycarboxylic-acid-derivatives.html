Printing inks with cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to printing inks, in particular packaging-printing inks, and also printing lacquers, which comprise cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives as components.<br>
The printing ink for what are known as mechanical printing processes, such as offset printing, letterpress printing, flexographic printing, intaglio printing, or screen printing is transferred to the print feed stock via contact between the print feed stock and a printing plate or printing block provided with printing ink. Printing inks for these printing processes usually comprise solvents, colorants, binders, and also various additives, such as plasticizers, antistatic agents or waxes. Printing inks for mechanical printing processes comprise high-viscosity paste printing inks for offset printing and letterpress printing, and also liquid printing inks with comparatively low viscosity for flexographic printing and intaglio printing. Further details are disclosed by way of example in "Printing Inks" - Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Sixth Edition, 1999 Electronic Release.<br>
Printing lacquers can be applied as primer to the print feed stock, or are applied after the printing procedure as a covering, onto the printed print feed stock. By way of example, the primers are applied in order to improve adhesion to the printing feed stock. In the form of a covering, printing lacquers serve, by way of example, to protect the printed image, or serve esthetic purposes, or serve to control application-related properties. By way of example, suitably formulated printing lacquers can be used to influence the roughness of the surface, the electrical properties, or the water-vapor-condensation properties. Printing lacquers are usually applied in-line by means of a lacquering system on the printing machine. Printing lacquers comprise no colorants, but in other respects their constitution is usually similar to that of printing inks.<br>
Printing inks are also used in multilayer materials. Multilayer materials are composed of two or more plastics foils, such as polyolefin foils, metal foils, or metallized plastics foils, which are bonded to one another, by way of example, via lamination or with the aid of suitable laminating adhesives. The composites may also comprise other functional layers, such as odor-barrier layers or water-vapor barriers.<br><br>
Multilayer materials for the production of packaging have usually been printed or coated. The printing ink here may have been applied to the surface of the multilayer material, but in particular its location may also be between two foils. The person skilled in the art is aware that a very low content of residual solvent in the dried printing ink is important for good strength of the composite.<br>
Printing inks usually comprise various auxiliaries or additives, alongside binders, solvents, and colorants. These auxiliaries or additives serve in particular for fine adjustment of the application-related properties of the printing ink, examples being adhesion, abrasion resistance, drying rate, or slip.<br>
Plasticizers are responsible, by way of example, for improved elasticity of the ink film on the print feed stock. This is particularly important when printing on nonabsorbent print feedstocks, such as polymer foils or metal foils, because here the printing ink is of course unable to penetrate into the print feed stock, but after evaporation of the solvent a dried film remains on the print feedstock. Printing inks for these types of print feed stocks therefore have to have very good film-forming properties, and also have to have very particularly good abrasion resistance and adhesion, so that the print film does not release from the substrate when subjected to mechanical stress.<br>
It is known that plasticizers can be used in printing inks, examples being phthalic diesters, such as dibutyl phthalate, or citric esters, such as tributyl acetylcitrate.<br>
However, in recent times phthalic diesters have been said to be potential health hazards. By way of example, WO 99/32427, WO 03/29339, DE 200 21 356, DE-A28 23 165, or DE-A 12 63 296 have proposed using cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acids and derivatives of these as plasticizers for plastics.<br>
The earlier application WO 03/29339, which is not a prior publication, discloses the use of cyclohexanepolycarboxylic diesters with C2-C6 alcohols as cosolvents in offset printing inks.<br>
However, there has been no disclosure hitherto of the use of cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives as plasticizers in printing inks, in particular packaging-printing inks.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide improved printing inks, in particular improved packaging-printing inks, and to lower the production costs.<br><br>
Accordingly, printing inks have been found which comprise at least one solvent or one mixture of various solvents, at least one colorant, at least one polymeric binder, and also one or more additives, where at least one of the additives is a cyclohexanepoly-carboxylic acid derivative.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the inventive printing ink is a packaging-printing ink.<br>
Printing lacquers have also been found which comprise at least one solvent or a mixture of various solvents, at least one polymeric binder, and also one or more additives, where at least one of the additives is a cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivative.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the use of cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives instead of conventional plasticizers gives printing inks with improved properties, whose production is moreover markedly more cost-effective. Firstly, the residual solvent content remaining in the printing ink becomes smaller. This permits multilayer materials to be obtained with better bond strength between the individual layers. The odor of the composite is moreover reduced. This is particularly important for food packaging. Secondly, the same effect is achieved in relation to flexibility, printing capacity, and overprintability of the printing ink even if the amount used is only about 50% of the amount of conventional plasticizers. Printing inks of this type can therefore be produced at markedly lower cost. A particular advantage is that, despite the reduction in the amount of plasticizer, there is no impairment of the other important application-related properties of the printing ink, e.g. adhesion, gloss, abrasion, viscostability.<br>
The following details are relevant to the invention:<br>
The inventive printing inks are printing inks for mechanical printing processes, such as offset printing, letterpress printing, flexographic printing, intaglio printing, or screen printing.<br>
The inventive printing ink is preferably a packaging-printing ink. The term "packaging-printing ink" is self-explanatory and at the same time restrictive. Packaging-printing inks are low-viscosity, fast-drying printing inks, in particular for intaglio printing and/or flexographic printing, and also, if appropriate, for screen printing, and are used for the printing of plastics foils of all types, composite materials, paper, paperboard, or metal foils. Accordingly, they comprise relatively low-boiling solvents. The boiling point of the solvents used is generally not above 140°C. The formulation of screen printing inks is similar to that of flexographic printing inks or intaglio printing inks, but is adjusted to<br><br>
somewhat higher viscosity and usually comprises solvents with somewhat higher boiling points. The inventive printing inks or printing lacquers can also be radiation-curable printing inks.<br>
The nature of the solvent or of the solvent mixture depends on the particular intended use of the printing ink or of the printing lacquer. The person skilled in the art will arrive at a suitable selection from the solvents which in principle can be used. Examples of solvents or components of solvent mixtures comprise hydrocarbons, such as toluene or xylene, and high-boiling mineral oils or vegetable oils, such as soy oil. Alcohols are also suitable, examples being ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, substituted alcohols, such as ethoxypropanol, esters, such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-propyl acetate or n-butyl acetate. It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of various solvents. Other solvents which are in principle suitable are aqueous solvent mixtures. The amount of solvents usually used, based on the entirety of all of the constituents, is from 10 to 80% by weight, depending on the nature of the printing ink or of the printing lacquer.<br>
Solvents particularly preferred for packaging-printing inks comprise in particular low-boiling solvents, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, or 2-propanol, and substituted alcohols, such as ethoxypropanol, or esters, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
The solvents used in radiation-curable printing inks for viscosity adjustment generally do not comprise the abovementioned solvents, but reactive diluents. Examples comprise butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, and in particular polyacrylates, such as 1,4-butanediol di(meth)acrylate, 1,6-hexanediol di(meth)acrylate, or trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate.<br>
The colorant present in the printing inks may be conventional dyes, and in particular conventional pigments. Examples are inorganic pigments, such as titanium dioxide pigments, or iron oxide pigments, interference pigments, carbon blacks, metal powders, particularly aluminum, brass, or copper powders, and also organic pigments, such as azo pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, or isoindoline pigments. It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of various dyes or colorants. It is also possible to use soluble organic dyes. The amount of colorants is usually from 5 to 25% by weight, based on the entirety of all of the constituents of the printing ink. Of course, printing lacquers comprise no colorant.<br>
The binders used for the inventive printing inks and printing lacquers may in principle comprise the binders conventionally used for printing inks. Examples of suitable binders comprise polyesters, polyamides, PVC copolymers, aliphatic and aromatic<br><br>
ketone resins, melamine-urea resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, maleinates, rosin derivatives, casein or casein derivatives, ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, or aromatic or aliphatic polyurethanes. It is also possible to use polymers or copolymers of vinyl acetate, of vinyl alcohol, of acrylates, of methacrylates, of vinylpyrrolidone, or of vinyl acetals. As disclosed in WO 02/36695 and WO 02/36697, hyperbranched polymers having functional groups, such as hyperbranched polyurethanes, polyureas, or polyesteramides, may be used with particular advantage. It is also possible, of course, to use mixtures of various polymeric binders, as long as the selected binders do not have any undesirable properties when compared with one another. The amount of all of the binders is usually from 5 to 20% by weight, based on the entirety of all of the constituents of the printing ink.<br>
Examples of binders which are particularly preferred for packaging-printing inks comprise nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and also aliphatic and aromatic polyurethanes and polyureas, in particular hyperbranched polyurethanes and polyureas, and also mixtures of these.<br>
Combinations of at least two different binders have proven successful for packaging-printing inks, in particular for the printing of plastics foils and metal foils. Combinations composed of nitrocellulose and of secondary binders, for example combinations composed of nitrocellulose and of polyurethanes and/or of polyureas, and very particularly preferably of hyperbranched polyureas and of polyurethanes, should also in particular be mentioned.<br>
Particularly suitable solvents for these binders are alcohols and/or esters.<br>
Radiation-curable printing inks comprise binders which comprise crosslinkable groups, such as olefinic groups, vinyl ether groups, or epoxy groups.<br>
The inventive printing inks and the inventive printing lacquers moreover comprise one or more auxiliaries or additives. Examples of additives and auxiliaries are fillers, such as calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide hydrate, or aluminum silicate or magnesium silicate. Waxes increase abrasion resistance and serve to increase slip. Particular examples are polyethylene waxes, oxidized polyethylene waxes, petroleum waxes, or ceresin waxes. Fatty acid amides can be used to increase surface smoothness. Plasticizers serve to increase the elasticity of the dried film. Another additive used for radiation-curable printing inks is at least one photoinitiator or one photoinitiator system. Dispersing agents can be used to disperse the pigments. The total amount of all of the additives and auxiliaries does not usually exceed 20% by weight, based on the entirety<br><br>
of all of the constituents, and is usually from 0.1 to 10% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
According to the invention, at least one of the fillers is at least one cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivative. This auxiliary is preferably used as plasticizer, particularly preferably in packaging-printing inks, but also has other advantageous consequential effects, for example a reduction in residual solvent content. However, this auxiliary can also, of course, be used by the person skilled in the art in order to achieve other effects.<br>
The cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives present according to the invention are in particular mono, di-, or, if appropriate, tri- or tetraesters, or else anhydrides of cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acids. It is preferable that all of the carboxylic acid groups have been esterified. The esters used are alkyl, cycloalkyl, and also alkoxyalkyl esters, and the alkyl, cycloalkyl, and also alkoxyalkyl groups here generally comprise from 1 to 30, preferably from 2 to 20, and particularly preferably from 3 to 18, carbon atoms, and may be branched or linear.<br>

Other compounds suitable for the purposes of the present invention are the hydrogenation products of the commercially available benzenecarboxylic esters with the trade names Jayflex DINP (CAS No. 68515-48-0), Jayflex DIDP (CAS No. 68515-49-1), Palatinol 9-P, Vestinol 9 (CAS No. 28553-12-0), TOTM-I (CAS No. 3319-31-1), Linplast 68-TM, Palatinol N (CAS No. 28553-12-0), Jayflex DHP (CAS No. 68515-50-4), Jayflex DIOP (CAS No. 27554-26-3), Jayflex UDP (CAS No. 68515-47-9), Jayflex DIUP (CAS No. 85507-79-5), Jayflex DTDP (CAS No. 68515-47-9), Jayflex L9P (CAS No. 68515-45-7), Jayflex L911P (CAS No. 68515-43-5), Jayflex L11P (CAS No. 3648-20-2), Witamol 110 (CAS No. 90193-91-2), Witamol 118 (di-n-C8-C10-alkyl phthalate), Unimoll BB (CAS No. 85-68-7), Linplast 1012 BP (CAS No. 90193-92-3), Linplast 13 XP (CAS No. 27253-26-5), Linplast 610 P (CAS No. 68515-51-5), Linplast 68 FP (CAS No. 68648-93-1) and Linplast 812 HP (CAS No. 70693-30-0), Palatinol AH (CAS No. 117-81-7), Palatinol 711 (CAS No. 68515-42-4), Palatinol 911 (CAS No. 68515-43-5), Palatinol 11 (CAS No. 3648-20-2), Palatinol Z (CAS No. 26761-40-0) and Palatinol DIPP (CAS No. 84777-06-0).<br><br>
Particularly preferred printing inks comprise diesters of cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Preferred ester groups are straight-chain or branched alkyl groups having from 5 to 13 carbon atoms. By way of example, this can be diisononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate, which is also commercially available with the name Hexamoll® DINCH (BASF AG).<br>
The amount of the cyclohexanecarboxylic acid derivatives used is generally from 0.1 to 3% by weight, based on the entirety of all of the constituents of the printing ink, in particular of the packaging-printing ink. The amount is preferably from 0.5 to 2.5% by weight, and particularly preferably from 1 to 2% by weight.<br>
While the plasticizer action is identical to that of conventional plasticizers, the residual solvent content in the printed layer is significantly reduced, and better printing properties are achieved.<br>
The method of production of the inventive printing inks or inventive printing lacquers can in principle be a known method via intensive mixing or intensive dispersion of the constituents in conventional apparatus, such as dissolvers, stirred ball mills, or a three-roll mill. It is advantageous to begin by preparing a concentrated pigment dispersion (also termed a pigment preparation) with a portion of the components, this subsequently being further processed with further constituents and further solvent to give the finished printing ink.<br>
The inventive printing inks can be used for the printing of substrates of any type. In particular, they can be used for the printing of plastics foils and of metal foils. They can moreover be used for the production of multilayer materials for packaging.<br>
The inventive printing lacquers can in particular be used for the priming of plastics foils or of metal foils, or as a protective layer, or as a finishing layer. They can moreover be used for the production of multilayer materials for packaging.<br>
The plastics foils can in particular be polyolefin foils, such as foils composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, or poly(4-methyl-1-pentene), or polystyrene. The polyethylene foils may be foils composed of HDPE, LDPE, or LLDPE. Copolymers can also be involved, examples being foils composed of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, of ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers, or of styrene-butadiene copolymers. It is also possible to use foils composed of PVC or of polycarbonates, or foils composed of polar materials, examples being cellophane foils, polyester foils, for example those composed of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, or polyethylene<br><br>
naphthalate, or polyamide foils, such as foils composed of PA 6, PA 12, PA 6/66, PA 6/12, or PA 11.<br>
Examples of metal foils comprise in particular aluminum foils, but by way of example the materials can also comprise tin foils, copper foils, or gold foils.<br>
Multilayer materials for the production of packaging, in particular food packaging, comprise at least two foils. These may in particular be those mentioned at the outset. They may be bonded to one another, by way of example, via lamination or with the aid of suitable laminating adhesives. The composites may also comprise other functional layers, such as odor-barrier layers or water-vapor barriers. Further details concerning the structure of these multilayer materials are mentioned by way of example in EP-A695 329, EP-A 707 956, EP 802 045, EP-A 1 008 442, EP-A 1 162 060, WO 03/93001, or WO 03/93002 expressly incorporated at this point herein. The inventive printing inks may be used for the printing of the multilayer materials. The printing ink here can be applied to the surface of the multilayer material, but its location can also be between two foils. By way of example, printing lacquers can be used for the priming of individual foils of the material, or else as a protective covering.<br><br>
The experiments below are intended to provide further illustration of the invention:<br>
A)	Production of the printing inks<br>
Printing inks were obtained in accordance with the following standard formulation (parts by weight) via intensive mixing or dispersion of all of the components:<br>
70.0    of pigment preparation (BASF Drucksysteme) 8.0     of nitrocellulose (Wolff) 6.0     of polyurethane co-binder (BASF Drucksysteme, 75% strength solution  in<br>
ethanol) 1.0     of oleamide (Croda) 0.5     of PE waxes (BASF AG) plasticizer (nature and amount as in Table 1) ethyl acetate as solvent (make-up to 100 parts by weight)<br><br>
Table 1: Plasticizers used, 'prepared via hydrogenation of a di(isononyl) phthalate with CAS No. 28553-12-0<br>
B)	Tests with the inventive printing inks<br>
Using each of the printing inks obtained, a test sample was printed on polyethylene foil, using a conventional intaglio machine. The test sample had various images, writing, solid areas, and also grids from 5 to 95%. The viscosity of the printing ink was comparable, as also were adhesion, scratch resistance, water resistance, and gloss of<br><br>
the printed film. However, there were marked differences in the quality of the prints, and also in the residual solvent content of the printed film.<br>
Table 2 gives the evaluation of the test prints. Table 3 gives the residual solvent contents.<br><br>
Table 2: Test print results<br><br>
Table 3: Residual solvent content of printed film<br>
The inventive and comparative examples show that, when comparison is made with conventional plasticizers, half of the amount is adequate to obtain a good printed image when cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid derivatives are used according to the invention<br><br>
as plasticizers. For the same amount of plasticizer, the amounts of residual solvent in the printed layer were smaller than when using conventional plasticizers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
