				<td>The invention relates to a new method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds and new cyclic urea compounds.<br>
The last few years have seen rapid development in the synthesis and uses of substituted ureas. In particular, cyclic ureas are present in a number of active ingredients currently being developed in the pharmaceutical industry, such as HIV protease inhibitors, or factor Xa (fXa) inhibitors. The cyclic ureas described in the literature (WO 93/07128, WO 96/29329, WO 97/08150, WO 98/20009) generally possess rings of 5, 6, 7 or 8 atoms. These rings can sometimes contain an additional hetero atom, such as a nitrogen atom adjacent to the urea function (Sham et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1996, 39, 392-397). The urea ring of the biologically active cyclic ureas described in the literature is used as a restrained conformation platform on which are arranged the pharmacophoric groups used for recognition by the HIV protease. It is therefore important to have a method of synthesis which is sufficiently flexible to easily allow the introduction of a molecular diversity at the level of the pharmacophoric groups as well as at the level of the position of these groups on the ring. The cyclic ureas described in the literature are generally prepared from the corresponding diamines by intramolecular cyclisationofsaid diamines using a1 carbonylation agent such as carbonyldiimidazole. The alkylation of N,N'-disubstituted ureas by alkyl bihalides for the preparation of cyclic ureas has also been described (WO96/00708 and WO 93/07128).<br>
Within the framework of research aimed at developing new compounds with immunomodulating activity, the applicant Company has previously developed a simple and effective method for the preparation of new stable activated carbamic acid derivatives from an N-protected amino acid derivative, comprising three steps:<br>
a)	a step of transformation of the -COOH group of the N-protected amino acid (a, p, y and 5 amino acids) into a -CON3 group in order to obtain an acyl azide,<br>
b)	a step of transformation of the -CON3 group of the acyl azide into a -NCO group in order to obtain an isocyanate,<br>
c)	a step of treatment of the isocyanate in order to obtain said stable carbamic^ acid derivative.<br><br>
The term "amino acid derivative" must be interpreted in a broad sense, as understood by the person skilled in the art, and designates in particular a peptide, polypeptide, protein, pseudopeptide or oligourea derivative.<br>
The carbamic acid derivatives are stable, crystalline inlemdiates which react with amines to form substituted ureas. The caroarmc acid derivatives also make it possible to prepare peptides containing urea motifs (Guichard et al., J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 8702-8705Tand GuichardeTaL, Tetrahedron Letter, 2000, 41, 1553-1557).<br>
One of the aspects of the invention is to propose a new method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to propose a new method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds, making it possible in order to obtain easily and in very few steps a considerable molecular diversity of cyclic urea compounds.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to propose new cyclic urea compounds.<br>
Generally, a subject of the invention is a method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds from at least one activatwijdarbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function, comprising a step of cyclisation by reaction between the primary or secondary amine function and the carbamic acid function of said carbamic acid derivative or derivatives.<br>
The term "activated carbamic acid derivative" denotes a carbamic acid derivative, in particular a carbamate, containing a primary or secondary amine function capable of reacting with primary or secondary amines in the presence or not in the presence of a base in an organic solvent.<br>
The term "non-protected" primary or secondary amine function denotes a free primary or secondary amine function, i.e. one capable of reacting with another chemical functional group, and in particular with a carbamic acid function. The "non-protected" primary or secondary function may also be referred to as "released", "free" or "deprotected" primary or secondary amine function.<br>
In the following, the term "activated carbamic acid derivative containing a nonprotected primary or secondary amine function" is also understood to mean:<br>
- an oligomeric carbamic acid derivative, also referred to in the following as "activated homo-oligomeric carbamic acid derivative" or "homo-oligomeric derivative" or "activated hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid derivative" or "hetero-oligomeric derivative" or,<br>
	a monomelic carbamic acid derivative, corresponding to an activated non-homo-<br>
oligomeric carbamic acid or to an activated non-hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid<br>
derivative.<br>
The homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid derivatives are obtained at the end of one or more homo-oligomerisation and/or hetero-oligomerisation reactions of at least one activated monomelic carbamic acid derivative. The homo-oligomerisation or hetero-oligomerisation reactions may also be referred to in the following as "intermolecular reactions".<br>
The term "cyclisation step" must be understood to mean an intramolecular cyclisation step, or an intermolecular cyclisation step.<br>
Intramolecular cyclisation occurs by reaction between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of the activated carbamic acid derivative and its carbamic acid function.<br>
Intermolecular cyclisation occurs by reaction between:<br>
-	the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of an activated carbamic acid derivative (denoted derivative 1) and the carbamic acid function of another activated carbamic acid derivative (denoted derivative 2) and,<br>
-	the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of said carbamic acid derivative 2 and the carbamic acid function of said carbamic acid derivative 1.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the invention concerns a method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds comprising:<br>
-	a step of obtaining at least one activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function from at least one stable activated carbamic acid derivative containing an amine function protected by a protecting group, by selective release of said protected amine function from said stable activated carbamic acid derivative or derivatives, by cleavage or transformation of said protecting group,<br>
-	a step of cyclisation by reaction between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of at least one activated derivative obtained at the end of the selective release step and the carbamic acid function of the derivative or derivatives.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the method of the invention, the cyclisation step is an intramolecular cyclisation between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of an activated derivative obtained at the end of the selective release step and its carbamic acid function.<br>
The term "protecting group" denotes a group protecting the amine function o f the activated carbamic acid derivative, in particular to prevent it from reacting with other chemical functional groups, during synthesis of said derivative.<br>
The term "stable activated carbamic acid derivative" denotes a carbamic acid derivative which can be isolated, purified and stored (preferably at 4°C) for a period of at least 3 months without appreciable degradation. Stability can be measured for example by the following test: high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or infra red (IR).<br>
The term "selective release" of the protected amine function must be understood to mean a release making it possible to release only the protected amine function of the stable activated carbamic acid derivative without altering the carbamic acid function of said derivative. In the following, the "selective release" step may also be referred to as "selective deprotection".<br>
The selective release or deprotection step of the amine function protected by a protecting group is dependent on:<br>
-	the protecting group used to protect the amine function and,<br>
-	the reagent used during deprotection or release of the amine function.<br>
The release of an amine function by cleavage of the protecting group or by transformation of the protecting group is carried out according to the standard methods described in the literature.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the method of the invention, the stable activated carbamic acid derivative containing an amine function protected by a protecting group is obtained from an amino acid derivative in which the amino group is protected by a method such as that described below, comprising the following three steps:<br>
-	transformation of the -COOH group of the N-protected amino acid derivative into a CON3 group in order to obtain an acyl azide,<br>
-	transformation of the -CON3 group of the acyl azide into an -NCO group in order to obtain an isocyanate,<br>
-	treatment of the -NCO isocyanate in order to obtain said stable carbamic acid derivative.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the preparation method of the invention, the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of the activated carbamic acid derivative is present:<br>
(1) in free form and/or,<br>
 (2) in protonated form, in particular in salt form.<br>
As an example of an activated carbamic acid derivative containing a primary or secondary amine in protonated form, in particular in salt form, the following may in particular be cited: an acetate salt, a hydrochloride salt or a trifluoroacetate salt.<br>
The activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in protonated form can be isolated, whereas the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in free form cannot be isolated: in the latter case, the cyclisation step takes place immediately after obtaining at least one activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function is obtained.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds comprises, during or at the end of the selective release step, a homo-oligomerisation and/or hetero-oligomerisation step between:<br>
-	the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of a molecule of the activated carbamic acid derivative and the carbamic acid function of another molecule of said activated carbamic acid derivative and/or,<br>
-	between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of a molecule of the activated carbamic acid derivative and the carbamic acid function of a molecule of another activated carbamic acid derivative, in order to obtain at least one homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric derivative of carbamic acid containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function.<br>
Thus, according to an advantageous embodiment, the preparation method of the invention comprises, during or at the end of the selective release step:<br>
-	a homo-oligomerisation step between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of a molecule of the activated carbamic acid derivative and the carbamic acid function of another molecule of said activated carbamic acid derivative, in order to obtain at least one homo-oligomeric carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function or,<br>
-	at least one homo-oligomerisation step between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of a molecule of an activated carbamic acid derivative and the carbamic acid function of another molecule of said activated carbamic acid derivative and at least one hetero-oligomerisation step between the non-protected primary or secondary amine function of a molecule of one activated carbamic acid derivative and the carbamic acid function of a molecule of another activated carbamic acid derivative, in order to<br>
obtain at least one homo-oligomeric and at least one hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function.<br>
Thus the bifunctional acyclic precursors obtained during or at the end of the selective release of the protected amine function, namely the monomelic activated carbamic acid derivatives containing a primary or secondary amine function in free or protonated form, can undergo, before the intramolecular cyclisation step, intermolecular homo- and/or hetero-oligomerisation reactions, to form homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric bifunctional acyclic precursors. The acyclic homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid derivatives thus obtained, like acyclic non-homo-oligomeric and/or non-hetero-oligomeric carbamic acid derivatives, then undergo intramolecular cyclisation (or macrocyclisation) by reaction of their non-protected primary or secondary amine function with their carbamic acid function, in order to obtain homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric cyclic ureas.<br>
However, for the intermolecular homo-oligomerisation and/or hetero-oligomerisation reactions, and the intramolecular cyclisation reactions to take place, the released primary or secondary amine function of the activated carbamic acid derivative must be in free form and not in protonated form. In effect, only the primary or secondary amine function in free form can react by intermolecular homo-oligomerisation or hetero-oligomerisation reaction, or by intramolecular cyclisation.<br>
Thus, when the activated carbamic acid derivative, obtained at the end of the selective release step, contains a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in free form, the homo- and/or hetero-oligomerisation, and intramolecular cyclisation reactions can take place immediately after the formation of the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in free form, as said amine function in free form can react with the activated carbamic acid group.<br>
When the activated carbamic acid derivative obtained at the end of the selective release step contains a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in protonated form, it will be necessary beforehand to neutralise said protonated form of the amine into free form so that the intermolecular homo-oligomerisation and/or hetero-oligomerisation reactions, and the intramolecular cyclisation reactions can take place.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds, when the activated carbamic acid derivative contains a primary or secondary amine function in protonated form, the homo-oligomerisation and/or hetero-oligomerisation step is carried out by neutralising the primary or secondary amine function<br>
in protonated form into a primary or secondary amine function in free form, in order to obtain at least one homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric derivative containing a nonprotected primary or secondary amine function in free form.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds, when the activated carbamic acid derivative contains a primary or secondary amine function in protonated form, the cyclisation step is carried out by neutralising the primary or secondary amine function in protonated form into a primary or secondary amine function in free form.<br>
The neutralisation of said protonated amine function into free form is in particular carried out using a base chosen from the group made up of diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, lutidine, pyridine, 2,4,6-collidine, N-methylmorpholine, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine or mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore, to carry out the step of intramolecular cyclisation of the activated oligomeric or monomelic carbamic acid derivatives containing a primary or secondary amine function, it is possible to use in particular a solvent chosen from the group made up of acetonitrile (MeCN), toluene, pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, dichloromethane, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof.<br>
The solvent used to carry out the cyclisation step is denoted in the following by the term "reaction solvent" or "cyclisation solvent".<br>
Thus, the step of intramolecular cyclisation of activated carbamic acid derivatives containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in protonated form is carried out in the presence:<br>
-	of a base in order to neutralise the protonated form of the amine into free form and,<br>
-	of the reaction solvent for intramolecular cyclisation,<br>
whereas the step of intramolecular cyclisation of activated carbamic acid derivatives containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in free form is carried out directly using a reaction solvent for intramolecular cyclisation.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the method of the invention the step of intramolecular cyclisation of the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a nonprotected primary or secondary function is carried out at a temperature of approximately -40°C to approximately 40°C, in particular of approximately -20°C to approximately 40°C, and preferably of approximately 0°C to approximately 20°C.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the method of the invention, the concentration of an activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in free form, in a solution containing a reaction solvent for intramolecular cyclisation, is approximately 10-6 M to approximately 10 M, in particular approximately 10-5 M to approximately 1 M, and preferably approximately 10-4 M to approximately 1 M.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the method of the invention, the concentration of an activated carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected primary or secondary amine function in protonated form, in a solution containing a reaction solvent for intramolecular cyclisation and a base, is approximately 10-6 M to approximately 10 M, in particular approximately 10-5 M to approximately 1 M, and preferably approximately 10-4 M to approximately 1 M.<br>
The concentration of the base in the reaction solvent for intramolecular cyclisation is approximately 10-6 M to approximately 10 M, in particular approximately 10-5 M to approximately 1 M, and preferably approximately 10-4 M to approximately 1 M.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds, the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a protected amine function is synthesised on a solid support, and is chemically bonded to said solid either (a) by its amine function, or (b) by its carbamic acid function, or (c) by any other functional group present in said activated carbamic acid derivative.<br>
The term "solid support" must be understood to mean the matrix on which the chemical reaction is carried out. This is generally an insoluble solid polymer which allows the filtration or centrifugation, and hence the separation of the reagents and of the product formed on the resin. As examples of solid supports, the following may be cited: polystyrene resins, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, cellulose, glass and silica.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the preparation method of the invention, when the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a protected amine function is chemically bonded to a solid support:<br>
-	by its amine function, the selective release step involves the cleavage of the amine function of said derivative vis-a-vis the support,<br>
-	by its carbamic acid function, the cyclisation step involves the cleavage of the carbamic acid function of said derivative vis-a-vis the support,<br>
-	by a functional group other than the amine or carbamic acid function, such as a hydroxyl function, an amide function or a carboxyl function, the cleavage of said<br>
Afunctional group vis-a-vis the support can take place during or at the end of any one of the selective release or cyclisation steps.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the preparation method of the invention, the amine function of the activated carbamic acid derivative is protected in the form of:<br>
-	a carbamate (ROCON-) group in which R is a tert-butyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, benzyl, allyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, ethyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group,<br>
-	tertiary amine group of formula R'N
-	an amide group,<br>
-	anitrogroup,<br>
-	an azide group,<br>
-	a trityl group,<br>
-	an ortho-(or para)-nitrophenylsulfonyl group,<br>
-	a tosyl group,<br>
-	a phthalimide group, or<br>
-	a cyano group.<br>
The release of the amine function by cleavage of the protecting group is carried out according to the standard methods described in the literature. In this connection, reference may be made to the work entitled "Protecting groups" by P.J. Kocienski (Thieme edition), which gives an exhaustive list of the protecting groups of the amine functions and their deprotection methods<br>
As examples, reference may be made in particular to:<br>
-	deprotection of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group (ROCO- with R = tert-butyl group) (also called Boc group ) in acid condition (trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid solution in a 3-4 M organic solvent) which leads to the obtaining of the corresponding amine in trifluoroacetate or hydrochloride salt form,<br>
-	deprotection of the benzyloxycarbonyl group (ROCO- with R = benzyl group) (also called Z group) or tertiary amines (of formula R'N
<br>
addition of an acid to protonate, or not to protonate, the released primary or secondary amine.<br>
The release of the amine function by transformation of a chemical group serving as hidden form of the amine such as a nitro, cyano, amide or azide group is in particular described in the examples below. However, these examples are not exhaustive, as there is a large number of methods making it possible to achieve the transformations described below ("Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry" de Vogel, (5th edition), 1989).<br>
The release of the amine function can be carried out by reduction of the nitro or cyano groups into amine, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C and PtC&gt;2 respectively.<br>
The transformation of an amide group into an amine group can be carried out by Hoffman rearrangement, for example by treatment of the amide with iodobenzyl bis-trifluoroacetate in a water/acetonitrile mixture.<br>
The reduction of an azide group into an amine group can be carried out by different methods, for example by catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride.<br>
The invention also relates to cyclic urea compounds comprising a ring of at least 7 atoms, in particular from 7 to 50 atoms, and preferably from 7 to 20 atoms, said ring comprising at least one amide function and at least one urea function, each amide or urea function being separated from the closest adjacent amide or urea function by at least one carbon atom, and in particular by 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The invention relates in particular to cyclic urea compounds comprising a ring of at<br>
least 7 atoms, in particular from 7 to 50 atoms, and preferably from 7 to 10 atoms, said ring<br>
comprising one amide function and one urea function, separated from one another by at<br>
least one carbon atom, and in particular by 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>

The amine function of the stable activated carbamic acid derivatives will be advantageously protected by oxycarbonyl groups (such as the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) groups or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) groups) or benzyl groups, or will be masked in the form of nitro, cyano or azide groups. Two methods of deprotection will be used advantageously according to the method of the invention.<br>
The Boc group will be deprotected by acid hydrolysis (for example using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), or a TFA/dichloromethane mixture, or a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution in an organic solvent (dioxane, ether etc.)), at a temperature of approximately 0°C to approximately 40°C, in order in order to obtain carbamic acid derivatives containing a protonated primary or secondary amine function, in trifluoroacetate or hydrochloride form.<br>
The hydrogenation will be used for cleavage of the Z and benzyl groups, and for reduction of the nitro, cyano or azide groups. The hydrogenation can be carried out with catalysts of the PtC*2, Pd/C type in solvents such as ethanol, methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform or a mixture of said solvents, at a temperature of approximately 0°C to approximately 40°C, and at a pressure of approximately 1 bar to approximately 100 bar. In the absence of acid added during hydrogenation (HCl or acetic acid), deprotection leads exclusively to carbamic acid derivatives containing a primary or secondary amine function in free form.

The p reparation m ethod o f t he p resent invention allows the cyclisation of carbamic acid derivatives obtained from N-protected amino acid derivatives (a, p, y and 8 amino acids), and thus make it possible to obtain easily and in very few steps, a considerable molecular diversity on the side chains used.

a)	a step of transformation of the -COOH group of the N-protected amino acid derivative (a, p, y and 5 amino acids) into a -CON3 group in order to obtain an acyl azide,<br>

from very simple molecules, such as the N-protected dipeptides, to give extremely functionalised and dissymetric cyclic urea molecules.<br>
It should be recalled that the term "amino acid derivative" must be interpreted in the broad sense, as understood by the person skilled in the art, and designates in particular a peptide, polypeptide, protein, pseudopeptide or oligourea derivative.<br>

(Formula Removed)The following examples illustrate the invention. They do not limit it in any way.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Intermolecular and intramolecular reactions which can occur during preparation of the cyclic urea compounds.<br>
The process of macrocyclisation from homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomenc bi functional acyclic precursors (activated carbamic acid derivatives containing a primary or secondary amine function), can lead to the obtaining of homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric cyclic urea compounds, whose size distribution depends on the dilution of the reaction medium and the effective molarity of the different linear precursors. It is the competition that exists between the intermolecular and intramolecular reaction processes that leads to the obtaining of a reaction mixture which can be more or less complex.<br>
1) Use of a stable activated carbamic acid derivative<br>
When the carbamic acid derivative containing a primary or secondary' amine function (precursor) in protonated form is reacted in the presence of a base, it is possible to obtain homo-oligomeric cyclic ureas of variable sizes, and in variable proportions.<br>
Diagram 1 below represents the homo-oligomeric cyclic urea compounds obtained at the end of intermolecular and intramolecular reactions.<br>
(Formula Removed)In this diagram, the secondary amine functions of the activated carbamic acid derivatives (bifunctional acyclic precursors) are represented in protonated form (VIc-1) and in free form (VIa-1).<br>
When the initial compound is the bifunctional acyclic precursor (VIa-1) (activated carbamic acid derivative containing a secondary amine function in free form) obtained at the end of the release step, the intermolecular homo-oligomerisation reaction can take place directly after said release step, without the addition of a base.<br>
When the initial compound is the bifunctional acyclic precursor (VIc-1) (activated carbamic acid derivative containing a secondary amine function in protonated form), the intermolecular homo-oligomerisation reaction takes place in the presence of a base, in order to neutralise the protonated secondary amine function into a secondary amine function in free form (VIa-1). At the end of the intermolecular homo-oligomerisation reaction, a bifunctional homo-oligomeric acyclic precursor containing a secondary amine function in free form (XXI) is obtained, which undergoes intramolecular cyclisation to form a homo-oligomeric cyclic urea (XXII). Thus, in the case where the precursor is the molecule (VIc-1) or (VIa-1), or the homo-oligomer (XXI), mass spectrometry of the reaction medium makes it possible to detect cyclic ureas (XXII) of variable sizes, from monomer to octamer, and represented by means of the integer n (n = an integer from 0 to 7). When n is equal to 0, there is no homo-oligomer formation, and the intramolecular cyclisation step b) takes place immediately after the formation of the compound (VIa-1).<br>
In general, for this family of precursors, among the cyclic ureas present in the reaction medium, the cyclic dimer (n = 1) is the main product.<br>
It is thus possible, from a single precursor (stable activated carbamic acid derivative containing a primary or secondary amine function in free form or protonated form), to obtain a mixture of homo-oligomeric cyclic ureas having rings of different sizes. The cyclic ureas thus obtained can be characterised by mass spectrometry and purified by chromatography.<br>
2) Use of two stable activated carbamic acid derivatives<br>
It is also possible, from a mixture of several precursors of the same family, to obtain a statistical distribution, for different ring sizes, of hetero-oligomeric and homo-oligomeric cyclic ureas.<br>
Diagram 2 below represents homodimeric (IHfl) and (IIId), and heterodimeric (IIIf2) cyclic urea compounds obtained at the end of intermolecular and intramolecular reactions.<br>
(Formula Removed)The secondary amine functions of the bifunctional acyclic precursors are represented in protonated form (VIc-1) and (VIc-2) and in free form (VIa-1) and (Vla-2).<br>
The two bifunctional acyclic precursors (VIc-1) and (VIc-2) (activated carbamic acid derivatives containing a secondary amine function in protonated form) each, in the presence of a base, undergo homo-dimerisation to form two homodimeric bifunctional acyclic precursors (XIa-1) and (XIa-3) respectively, containing a secondary amine function in free form, as well as hetero-dimerisation to form a dimeric bifunctional precursor (XIa-2) containing a secondary amine function in free form.<br>
Said homo-dimeric (XIa-1), (XIa-3) and heterodimeric (XIa-2) derivatives thus obtained undergo intramolecular cyclisation to form homodimeric cyclic ureas (Illfl) and (IIH3) and one heterodimeric cyclic urea (IIIC) respectively.<br>
Thus, if the reaction is carried out on a mixture of two precursors, (VIc-1), (VIc-2) or (VIa-1), (VIa-2), in the case of cyclic dimers, a heterodihier (IIIf2) and two homodimers (Illfl) and (IIM3) must statistically be formed.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Cleavage of the activated carbamic acid derivative containing a protected amine function in relation to the solid support.<br>
Diagram 3 below represents the cleavage, in relation to a solid support (a resin), of an activated carbamic acid of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)in which<br>
X represents a group conferring upon said derivative an activated carbamic acid function,<br>
B represents the protected amine function,<br>
A represents the part of the molecule separating the activated carbamic acid function and the protected amine function.<br>
■I represents the solid support (resin).<br><br>
(Formula Removed)The activated carbamic acid derivative is chemically bonded to the resin either (1) by its amine function (the resin and the resin arm serving as protecting group) [case #1], or (2) by its activated carbamic acid function [case #2], or (3) by another functional group present in said activated carbamic acid derivative [case #3].<br>
On the basis of the method of attachment of the activated carbamic acid derivative to the resin, the cleavage can be achieved either before the intramolecular cyclisation step (the cyclisation step will then be carried out in solution after cleavage) [case #1, case #2, case #3-1 and case #3-3] or after the cyclisation step (which will therefore take place on the solid support [case #3-2].<br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Method for preparation of cyclic urea compounds from N-Boc protected carbamic acid derivatives (XVII) and (XIX).<br>
The selectivity of the deprotection of the amine function is dependent on the type of protecting group used for the amine and on the activated carbamic acid group. Such an example of orthogonality (namely the selective release of the amine function so as not to alter the carbamic acid function of the activated carbamic acid derivative) is shown below by the selective deprotection of the Boc (ter-butoxycarbonyl) group which does not alter the integrity of the O-succinimidyl carbamate (XVII), and (XIX). In effect the O-succinimidyl carbamate is not degraded in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid in organic solvent: the step of release of the amine function (via deprotection of the Boc group) is thus completely selective.<br>
This example is by no means exhaustive. It is possible to imagine other types of orthogonality such as the use of the benzyloxycarbonyl group with O-succinimidyl carbamate.<br>

Studies have shown that the N-hydroxysuccinimide carbamate was stable in an acid medium (treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for example). The carbamic acid derivatives of N-hydroxysuccinimide (XVII) and (XIX) represented in diagram 4 below have been synthesised as described previously, namely by:<br>
-	a step of transformation of the -COOH group of the corresponding N-protected amino acid derivative into a -CON3 group in order to obtain an acyl azide,<br>
-	a step of transformation of the corresponding -CON3 group of the acyl azide into a -NCO group in order to obtain an isocyanate,<br>
-	a step of treatment of the corresponding isocyanate in order to obtain the carbamic acid derivative of N-hydroxysuccinimide of formula (XVII) or (XIX).<br>
The diagrams of synthesis of the activated carbamic acid derivatives of N-kydrosuccinimide (XVII) and (XIX) are respectively represented below:(Formula Removed)The experimental conditions of the different steps in obtaining the carbamic acid derivative (XVII) are described in the publication of Guichard et al., "J. Org. Chem., 1999, 64, 8702-8705".(Formula Removed)The experimental conditions of the different steps in obtaining the carbamic acid derivative (XIX) are identical to those described for the compound (XVII).<br>
Diagram 4 below represents the selective deprotection by the trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) of the Boc group of the N-protected carbamic acid (XVII) and (XIX) and succinimidyl derivatives.<br>
(Formula Removed)The treatment of the N-Boc protected carbamates (XVII) and (XIX) by TFA makes it possible to obtain the intermediate compounds (XVIIla) and (VIc-3) (trifluoroacetate salts which can be isolated), or (XVIIIb) and (VIa-3) (which cannot be isolated) which represent precursors of interest for the synthesis of cyclic urea compounds.<br>
The N-Boc protected carbamic acid derivatives (XVII) and (XIX) are each dissolved in a solution of trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH or TFA) (deprotection solvent) containing methylene chloride (CH2CI2) (50/50 v/v for example), or in a solution of pure TFA. After 30 minutes, the TFA is evaporated or coevaporated in the presence of ether (Et20) or hexane. In a certain number of cases, the addition of ether or hexane leads to a precipitate which is filtered and dried under vacuum. Otherwise, the residual oil after evaporation of the TFA is dried under vacuum.<br>
2) Step o f intramolecular cyclisation of the precursor compounds (XVIIIb) and (VIa-3).<br>
The TFA salts (XVIIIa) and (VIc-3) previously isolated are each dissolved or suspended in a volume of solvent (for example of acetonitrile (MeCN)) (cyclisation solvent) to achieve a dilution ranging from approximately 0.0001M to approximately 0.1M. A tertiary base (at least one equivalent to neutralise the amine salt formed during the deprotection step), for example diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, triethylamine (Et3N), lutidine or collidine (pure or diluted in an organic solvent such as MeCN) is added (either dropwise, or directly) to the trifluoroacetate salt solution over a period of time that may be up to 24 hours.<br>
Compounds (XVIHb) and (VIa-3) thus obtained react intramolecularly to give corresponding cyclic urea compounds which possess different ring sizes.<br>
The reaction is followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). When there is no further reaction, the solvent is evaporated and the residue is purified either by inverse phase HPLC, or by flash chromatography on silica, or by recrystallisation in an appropriate solvent to give the expected cyclic urea compound or compounds.<br>

-	the step o f i ntramolecular c yclisation from t he c arbamic a cid d erivative t hus obtained containing an amine function in free form.<br>

General method: to a solution of (Ij) (1 equivalent) in distilled THF is added NaH (5 equivalents) then the electrophile (RX, 3 equivalents). The reaction mixture is agitated for 3 to 48 hours. The reaction is followed by RP-HPLC using a CI8 column. At the end of the reaction, ethyl acetate is added and the organic phase is washed with NH4CI. To eliminate the surplus electrophile, if this is not volatile, and if purification on silica is not desirable, a "scavenger" resin can be used, such as (mercaptoethyl)aminoethylpolystyrene resin for example. In this case, the "scavenger" resin (approximately 10 equivalents) is added to the reaction medium and the mixture is agitated for 48 hours.

(Formula Removed)2) Preparation of the compounds (Ir), (Is), and (It) by monoalkylation of (Ij)<br>
General method: to a solution of (Ij) (1 equivalent) in a distilled anhydrous solvent (THF, MeCN or CH2CI2) is added potassium fluoride on alumina (40w/w) (10 equivalents) followed by the electrophile (RX, between 1 and 20 equivalents). The reaction mixture is agitated for 20 to 72 hours. The reaction is followed by RP-HPLC using a CI8 column. At the end of the reaction the potassium fluoride on alumina is eliminated by filtration. To eliminate the surplus electrophile, if this is not volatile, and if purification on silica is not desirable, a "scavenger" resin can be used, such as (mercaptoemyl)aminoethylpolystyrene resin for example. In this case the "scavenger" resin (approximately 10 equivalents) is added to the reaction medium and the mixture is agitated for 48 hours. At the end of this treatment, the resin is eliminated by filtration and the organic phase is concentrated to give the desired purified product as shown in diagram 13 and in table 3. It is possible, under the best conditions (approximately 1 RX equivalent, reaction time of 48 h, see table 3), in order to obtain a selectivity of mono-alkylated product relative to di-alkylated product of the order of 93:7.<br><br>

Structural properties of cyclic urea compounds (I)<br>
Cyclic urea compounds (I) have an extremely constrained structure, well defined on the basis of X-ray diffraction or of NMR. Knowledge of this structure is extremely useful for use of the heterocyclic platform based on the compounds (I) for the design and discovery of new compounds of pharmacological interest. The structure of (Ij) (see Figures 1A and IB) has been obtained by X-ray diffraction and is representative of the structure of the compounds (I). This structure is in keeping with that obtained for the same compound by two-dimensional NMR and by modelling. The l,3,5-triazepine-2,6-dione ring has a strongly folded conformation. The planes of the two amide and urea groups meet along a line joining the alpha carbon of the gem-Sarcosine residue (-N(CH3)-aCH2-NH- and the alpha carbon of the phenylalanine with a dihedral angle of 120°. By way of comparison, in the case of the most folded diketopiperazines, the dihedral angle defined by the amide planes is of the order of 140-160°. Moreover, the hydrogen atoms in axial positions on the alpha carbon of the gem-Sarcosine residue and the alpha carbon of the phenylalanine are spatially extremely close: they are separated by only 2.03 angstroms. By way of comparison, the distance between the protons situated on the alpha carbons in the folded diketopiperazines is of the order of 2.7-2.8 angstroms.<br>

Intramolecular cyclisation reactions.<br>
1.1 mportance o f t he g eometry o f t he p eptide amide bond in the carbamic acid derivatives of formula (Vic).<br>
The cyclisation experiments carried out within the framework of the present invention using carbamic acid derivatives of type (Vic) (with X= succinimide) indicate that the geometry of the amide bond -CO-NR3- (peptide bond) plays an important role in the nature of the products obtained, and more precisely in the size of the rings obtained. The peptide bond is characterised by its geometry which was established using crystallographic data and NMR. The peptide bond -CO-NR3- can be either in trans configuration, or in cis configuration (cf. diagram 21). In general the equilibrium is shifted strongly towards the trans form. In the presence of proline or in the case of N-substitution, the cis form can become as important as the trans form.<br>
Diagram 21:<br>
Compounds (Vic) for which R3 is not a hydrogen, for example those for which R3 is a methyl (cf. compound (VIc-6) of diagram 8) or those for which R3 forms with R4 a 5-atom proline ring (cf. compound (VIc-5) of diagram 7) preferably cyclise without intermolecular reaction before cyclisation, to give only the corresponding 7-atom ring (cyclic monomer) of type (la). This is certainly due to the cis preference of the amide bond in this type of compound. In effect, in very constrained rings, the amide bond is of cis geometry, and this geometry must be in the majority to allow the formation of the 7-atom ring.<br>
Cyclisation of the compounds (Vic) for which R3 is a hydrogen does not lead to the obtaining of the cyclic monomer. This is explained by the trans preference of the amide bond -CO-NR3- in this type of precursor. The cyclisation occurs after one or more intramolecular coupling reactions, which leads to the obtaining of cyclic oligomers of variable size. Thus cyclisation of the compound (XlXa) (diagram 6) preferentially leads to the obtaining of the cyclic dimer (IIIf-4) (70%). However, study<br>
Of the reaction raw material by mass spectrometry makes it possible to identify larger macrocycles (trimer, tetramer, pentamer) following a Gaussian distribution.<br>
2. P referred cyclisation conditions in the case of succinimidyl carbamate derivatives of type (Vic).<br>
The importance of a number of parameters (order of addition of the reagents, dilution, temperature) was evaluated during cyclisation of the derivatives (XlXa), (XlXb) and (XIXc) (cf. diagrams 6, 7 and 8).<br>
•	Order of addition of the reagents<br>
Generally the carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected amine function ((VIc-4), (VIc-5) or (VIc-6)) rendered soluble in the reaction solvent (solvent used to carry out the cyclisation) (MeCN for example) is added dropwise to a solution containing a base and the reaction solvent (MeCN for example).<br>
It is also possible to reverse this order by adding dropwise the solution containing a base and the reaction solvent to the solution containing the derivative to be cyclised ((VIc-4), (VIc-5) or (VIc-6)) and the reaction solvent.<br>
Thus a reaction mixture is obtained containing the cyclic urea compounds (IIIf-4), (Ii) and (Ij) respectively.<br>
•	Dilution conditions<br>
As regards the dilution, the concentration of the carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected amine function ((VIc4), (VIc5) or (VIc-6)) in the reaction solvent (solvent used for the cyclisation) has no influence on the cyclisation of the derivatives (XlXb) and (XIXc). In these examples, the concentrations used vary from approximately 1 M to approximately 10"3 M.<br>
In contrast, in the case of cyclisation of compound (XlXa), the dilution has an effect on the nature of the cyclic compounds obtained. When the reaction is carried out in a dilute solution (containing a carbamic acid derivative containing a non-protected amine function (VIc4), (VIc5) or (VIc-6) in the reaction solvent) whose concentration varies from approximately 1 0"5 M to 1 0"3 M, the main product obtained is the cyclic dimer (IIIf-4) (70%). The cyclic trimer represents less than 15%, and the cyclic tetramer less than 5%. In contrast, when the reaction is carried out at a higher concentration (above 10"3 M), the intermolecular reactions are clearly encouraged and<br><br>
rings of larger size (up to cyclic pentamer) are obtained, in higher proportions, to the detriment of the cyclic dimer.<br>
•  Temperature conditions<br>
Temperature has only a slight influence on the cyclisation of products (XIX b) and (XIXc). Thus, the cyclisation reaction of derivatives (XlXb) and (XDCc) leads to derivatives (Ii) and (Ij) respectively in similar yields, whether the reaction takes place at 20°C0°Cor-10oC.<br>
In contrast, the yield from cyclisation of compound (XlXa), leading to compound (IIIf-4), seems more sensitive to temperature, the best yield being obtained when the reaction is carried out between 0°C and 20°C. For temperatures above 40°C, the reaction leads to an appreciable increase in the formation of rings which are larger in size (increase in the oligomerisation reaction) whereas at a temperature of -20°C the reactivity of (XlXa) is very low and does not lead to the obtaining of compound (IIIf-4)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
