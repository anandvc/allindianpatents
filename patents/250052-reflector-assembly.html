				<td>The present invention relates to a reflector assembly.<br>
It is known for luminaire to include reflectors for reflecting light emitted by a light source, in a predetermined pattern or geometry, to improve the effectiveness of the lurninaire and to provide different hghting effects. Known reflectors typically comprise a single moulded or formed reflector having a reflective surface shaped to give a. desired lighting effect. Commonly for example, the reflective surface forms the inner surface of a cone with a light source at its centre. Hence, in operation, light is reflected evenly in a substantially circular pattern. In anothei' example, the reflector surface is shaped to reflect light in an elongated pattern for effective lighting across a road or the like.<br>
Whilst reflectors of this type may be made in. a wide variety of shapes and sizes, manufacture of a range of luminaire required to give different hghting geometries necessitates different tooling for each reflector type. This is undesirable because it adds to the cost and complexity of the manufacturing process. Furthermore, since even a slight change in lighting pattern requirements necessitates new tooling, the development cost and lead-time for new or modified products is increased. Hence customers are constrained to a relatively small number of pre-designed lighting patterns.<br>
One attempt to deal with this problem is set out in EP 0 604 515 B1. This patent describes a luminaire in which the reflector includes a frame to which four reflectors are piyotafly mounted. Each reflector can be moved about a single pivot point to adjust the light distribution and then secured in position. However, because each reflector is constrained to pivot about a fixed axis, the range of light distributionpattems that can be obtained is limited. Furthermore, each reflector is only correctly focused in one position. Hence, any movement away from the ideal position results in the light from the lamp being incorrectly focused, reducing the efficiency of the luminaire. The present invention provides an improved reflector assembly that overcomes or at least<br>
mitigates the above problems.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a reflector assembly for<br>
a lurainaire comprising a base portion; and, a plurality of reflector portions for reflecting light<br>
emitted from an associated light source of the luminaire, each of which are individually<br>
mountable on the base portion in any of a plurality of discrete positions.<br>
Each of the reflector portions may be adapted to be mounted to die base portion in discrete<br>
positions that are not co-axial.<br>
Each of the reflector portions may be adapted to be mounted to the base portion in discrete<br>
positions that are transversely and/or longitudinally displaced on the base relative to each<br>
other.<br>
Each of the reflector portions may be adapted to be mounted to die base portion in discrete<br>
positions that are not constrained about a common fixed axis of rotation.<br>
Preferably, the reflector portions are mountable on the base portion in two or more different<br>
configurations, each configuration corresponding to a desired light distribution pattern. More<br>
preferably, the reflector portions are mountable on the base portion such that the focus of the<br>
reflector assembly relative to the light source is optimised for each desired light distribution<br>
pattern.<br>
The reflector portions may be selected from a range of differently configured reflector<br>
portions.<br>
One or more of the reflector portions may comprise a plurality of integral, substantially planar<br>
polygonal sections arranged in a grid formation to fonn piecewise a substantially curved<br>
structure with a concave reflective surface.<br>
The base portion may comprise a peripheral portion at least partially surrounding an opening,<br>
the reflector portions being moiir)table to the peripheral portion so as to reflect light from the<br>
light source through the opening.<br>
The base portion may comprise a plate member.<br>
An array of reflector portion mounting holes may be provided in the base portion for<br>
receiving fastening means for attaching the reflector portions to the base portion. The<br>
mounting holes may be arranged so as to enable each reflector portion to be mounted in a<br>
plurality of discrete positions on the base portion. The mounting holes are preferably<br>
arranged so as to enable the reflector portions to be mounted to the base portion in two or<br>
more predetermined configurations, each corresponding to a desired light distribution pattern.<br>
The reflector portions may each have a reflector member and footing for mounting to the base<br>
portion. In which case, the footing may be provided with an array of mounting holes and at<br>
least some of the mounting holes in the footing may be arranged to align with corresponding<br>
mounting holes in the base portion when the respective reflector portion is in a correct<br>
position to form part of one of the predetermined configurations.<br>
Where provided, the mounting holes in the base portion and/or the mounting holes in the<br>
footings may be colour coded or otherwise marked to assist mounting of the reflector portions<br>
in the predetermined configurations.<br>
At least some of the reflector portions may have a separate reflector member and footing.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
constructing a reflector for a luminaire, including:<br>
providing a base portion; and, a plurality of reflector portions for reflecting light emitted<br>
from an associated light source of the luminaire, each of which are individually mountable on<br>
the base portion in any of a plurality of discrete positions;<br>
mounting the reflector portions on the base member so as to configure the reflector to provide<br>
a desired light distribution pattern.<br>
Preferably, the method also includes selecting the reflector portions from a range of<br>
differently configured reflector portions.<br>
Preferably, the method also includes positioning the reflector portions on the base portion so<br>
as to optimise the focus of the reflector relative to the light source for the desired light<br>
distribution pattern.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a luminaire having a<br>
reflector in accordance with the first aspect of the invention or constructed in accordance with<br>
the method of the second aspect of the invention.<br>

configuration; and<br>
Figure 11 shows illustratively the lighting pattern produced by the second configuration.<br>
In Figure 1 a lumiiiaire is shown generally at 10. The lutninaire 10 comprises, an internal<br>
chassis 12, a closure member 14, an outer casing 16, and a reflector means indicated<br>
generally at 18.<br>
The chassis 12 comprises a housing having an internal cavjty20 in which the reflector means<br>
18, a lamp 22, and any control gear (not shown) may be received and removeably mounted.<br>
The closure member 14 is configured to engage with the chassis 12 to substantially enclose<br>
the reflector assembly, the lamp 22 and the control gear within in the cavity 20 forprotection.<br>
The closure member 14 includes a transparent or translucent portion 24, through which light<br>
from the lamp 22 can be emitted.<br>
The reflector means 18 includes a main reflector assembly 26 in accordance with the<br>
invention and a top reflector 28 shown in Figures 1 and 3.<br>
The main reflector assembly 26 comprises a base portion 30 on to which are mounted a<br>
plurality of reflector portions or segments 32,32', 32". The base portion 30 is in the form of<br>
a plate having central opening 34 and a peripheral portion 35 about the opening. As can be<br>
seen from Figures 2,3,4,8 &amp; 10, the reflector portions are mounted on one face of the base<br>
portion and are arranged so that the reflective surfaces 36 of the reflector portions face<br>
inwardly towards the opening 34.<br>
The central opening 34 in the base portion 30 is symmetrical about a central axis AB, and is<br>
shaped such that the reflector portions 32,32', 32" can be arranged to partially overhang the<br>
opening. The base portion 30 also includes an access point or aperture 38 which is located on<br>
one side of the base portion 30 symmetrically about the central axis AB. One end of the lamp<br>
22 is mounted above the access point 38 such that the position of the lamp relative to the<br>
opening between the reflector portions 32, 32', 32" can be adjusted, for example using a<br>
screw driver. This allows for fine adjustment of the lamp focus, substantially in the direction<br>
of the axis AB. The arrangement is such that the reflector portions reflect light from the lamp<br>
through the central opening 34.<br>
In use, the top reflector 28 is positioned above the main reflector assembly and the lamp and<br>
is shaped so as to reflect light from the lamp back through the central opening 34 in the base<br>
portion as well as onto the reflector portions 32, 32', 32" of the main reflector assembly.<br>
The shape and configuratian of the top reflector 28 can be varied as required to suit any<br>
particular application.<br>
Whilst the base portion 30 of the present embodiment is in the form of a circular plate having<br>
a central opening 34, it will be understood by those skilled in the ait that this need not be the<br>
case. For example, the plate need not be circular and the opening need not be central.<br>
Furthermore, the base portion 30 need not be in the form of a platememberbut could take the<br>
form of a framework of any desired shape. In certain embodiments, the peripheral portion 35<br>
of the base portion need not completely surround the opening.<br>
A range of differently sized and shaped reflector portions 32,32', 32" can be provided, with<br>
each reflector portion being individually mounted to the base portion 30 in any one of a<br>
number of discrete positions. This enables the main reflector assembly 26" to be assembled in<br>
various configurations to produce different light distribution patterns or geometries.<br>
Furthermore, because the reflector portions are not constrained to move about a fixed axis<br>
point, it is possible to position the reflector portions to ensure that the reflector assembly is<br>
optimally focused relative to the light source for each light distribution pattern.<br>
Figures 8 and 10 illustrate two possible configurations of the main reflector 26. The<br>
configuration in Figure 8 produces a wide forward throw distribution of light similar to that<br>
shown in Figure 9, for use on a wide road, for example. By contrast, the configuration shown<br>
in Figure 10 produces a more elongate and narrower distribution of light, similar to that<br>
shown in Figure 11, that would be suitable for lighting across a standard or narrow road, for<br>
example.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 8 and 10 in particular, the reflector portions 32,32', 32" hi the<br>
present embodiments are of two main types. Side reflectors 32,32' are arranged around the<br>
perimeter of the opening 34 in general alignment with the central axis AB. The side<br>
reflectors 32, 32' have a reflective surface 36 that is effectively concave and which curves<br>
generally in the direction A to B of the central axis. End reflector portions 32' are arranged<br>
around the perimeter of the opening 34 along an edge generally opposite from the lamp<br>
adjustment aperture 3 8 In contrast to the side reflectors 32,32', the reflective surfaces of the<br>
end reflectors 32" do not curve along their major axis.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a typical side reflector portion 32 in detail. The side reflector portion<br>
32 comprises a separate base member or footing 42 and a reflector member 44 having a<br>
reflective surface 36 mounted to the footing 42.<br>
The reflector member 44 may be made from any suitable material, such as metal or plastics,<br>
and has a reflective surface 36, which may be highly polished. The reflector member <br>
comprises a plurality of integral, substautiallyplanarpolygonal sections or facets 46 arranged<br>
in a grid formation to form piecewise a substantially curved structure with a concave inside<br>
surface 36 and a convex external surface. The sections 46 are formed by folding the material<br>
of the reflector along first fold lines 48 that run generally parallel with the surface of the base<br>
portion 30 and second fold lines 50 that extend generally perpendicular to the surface of the<br>
base portion 30. Each polygonal section 46 is substantiallyplanar and the individual sections<br>
combine to make up the effectively curved, faceted reflective surface 36.<br>
In the reflector portion 32 shown in Figures 5 and 6, the polygonal sections 46 are<br>
quadrilateral and the grid formation is five sections 46 wide by three sections 46 high.<br>
However, the side reflector portions 32, 32' can be produced with any required number of<br>
sections 46. For example, the side reflector portions 32' are narrower, being only three<br>
sections 46 wide.<br>
The reflector footing 42 can also be made of any suitable material but is preferably made<br>
from plastics. The footing is in the form of a substantially planar plate having a front edge 51<br>
that curves in conformity with the curvature of the reflector member 44. The footing has a<br>
plurality of fixing holes 52, by means of which the footing can be secured to the base portion<br>
30. The fixing holes can be in any suitable formation but in the present embodiment are<br>
arranged in two lines converging away from the front edge.<br>
Adjacent the front edge 51, the footing 42 has a first set of four upwardly projecting<br>
mounting lugs 54. Spaced rearwardly from the first set of mounting lugs 54 is a second set<br>
of five upwardly projecting mounting lugs 56. Between the first and second sets of<br>
mounting lugs is a gap into which one edge of the reflector member 44 is received with a<br>
snug or interference fit. The lugs 56 in the second set are offset from the lugs 54 in the first<br>
set and are supported by braces 58. The lugs 54 in the first set are smaller than those 56 of<br>
the second set and are tapered so as to minimise any interference with the reflective surface<br>
36 of the reflector member 44.<br>
The lugs 56 or 51 may have small protrusions which snap fit in to co-operatively formed<br>
holes in the lower reflector sections 46 to produce a locked fit upon assembly. Hence, the<br>
reflector member 44 is fixedly mounted to the footing 42 between the two sets of mounting<br>
lugs 54,56 to form a composite side reflector portion or segment 32,32'. Each side reflector<br>
portion 32,32' can then be mounted to the base portion 30 of the mam reflector by aligning<br>
at least two (preferably at least four) of the fixing holes 52 in the footing 42 with respective<br>
fixing holes 60 provided in the base portion 30 corresponding to a desired position. The<br>
footing can then be secured to the base portion using any suitable fastening means such as<br>
rivets, screw threaded fasteners and the like. Alternatively, the footings 42 can be mounted to<br>
the base portion 30 first and the reflector members 44 assembled to the footings 42<br>
afterwards, in order to reduce the risk of the reflective surfaces 36 becoming damaged or<br>
contaminated during assembly.<br>
Whilst the base portion 30 is provided with a plurality of mounting holes 60 that arc intended<br>
to enable the reflector portions to be mounted in positions corresponding to a number of predetermined<br>
configurations, additional holes 60 can be produced if required.<br>
Although the side reflectors 32,32' as described above have separate reflector members 44<br>
and footings 42, it should be understood that the side reflectors 32,32' could be produced as<br>
a single component with an integral reflector member and footing if desired.<br>
The construction of an end reflector 32 " can be seen best from Figure 4. Each end reflector<br>
32", comprises an integral reflector base or footing 62 and reflector member 64 having a<br>
reflective surface 36. The reflector member 64 has first, second, and third substantially<br>
planar rectangular sections or facets 66,68,70 formed by folding the material of the reflector<br>
along three fold lines 72,74,76 that extend generally parallel to each other and to the surface<br>
of the base portion 30.<br>
The first fold line 72 is provided between the footing 62 and the first rectangular section 66<br>
such that the first rectangular section 66 extends substantially perpendicular to the reflector<br>
footing 62 forming an approximate 'L' shape cross-section. The second fold line 74 extends<br>
between the first and second sections 66, 68, with the second section being angled<br>
backwardly slightly towards the rear of the footing 62. The third fold line 76 extends<br>
between the second and third sections 68, 70 such that the third section 70 is angled<br>
forwardly so as to reflect light through the opening 34 in the base member 30, when, the end<br>
reflector portion 32" in is in position on the base member.<br>
The sections 66,68,70 each have a reflective surface facing away from the base portion that<br>
combine to form the reflective surface 36 of the end reflector portion 32".<br>
The end reflector footing 62 is substantially planar for positioning on the surface of the base<br>
portion. 30. The footing 62 also has a plurality of fixing holes 52 to enable the end reflector<br>
to be attached to the base portion 30, in a manner similar to that described above in relation to<br>
the side reflectors 32,32'.<br>
10<br>
It will be appreciated that the end reflector portions 32" need not have an integral footing but<br>
could have a separate footing member similar to the footings 42 of the side reflectors 32, 32'<br>
described above.<br>
Whilst onlythree configurations of reflector portions 32,32', 32" are described, it should be<br>
understood that many other configurations are possible. For example, the grid formations of<br>
the side reflectors 32, 32' may comprise any suitable number of polygonal sections of any<br>
suitable shape. The reflector and reflector footings of any of the reflector portions described<br>
may be integral or they may be mounted separately. Siniilarly, any suitable arrangement of<br>
fixing holes may also be used.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, in addition to the reflector mounting holes 60, the base portion 30 has<br>
a plurality of chassis mounting holes 78, for mounting the reflector assembly to the chassis<br>
12, and optional lamp mounting holes 80 for mounting the lamp 22.<br>
The reflector mounting holes 60 are of suitable size and arrangement to allow each reflector<br>
portion 32, 32', 32" to be individually mounted in any of a plurality of transversely,<br>
longitudinally and/or rotationaily discrete positions on the base portion. The discrete<br>
positions are such that the mounted reflector portions 32, 32', 32" tend to reflect light<br>
emitted from the lamp through the central opening 34 to form a desired lighting pattern.<br>
Hence, the lighting pattern formed is dependent on the discrete positions in which the<br>
reflector portions 32, 32', 32"are mounted as well as the size and shape of the individual<br>
reflector portions themselves.<br>
Conveniently, the reflector mounting holes 60 and/or fixing holes 52 hi the reflector portion<br>
footings may be colour coded or otherwise marked to assist mounting of the reflector portions<br>
32,32', 32" in preset configurations suitable for giving pre-determined lighting geometries.<br>
To configure the main reflector assembly 26 for giving a desired lighting pattern, a plurality<br>
of reflector portions 32, 32', 32" of the same or different types are selected. The reflector<br>
portions 32, 32', 32" are then mounted on the base portion hi an arrangement of discrete<br>
positions suitable for giving the desired lighting pattern. If there is a need to subsequently<br>
alter the light distribution pattern, the reflector portions can beremoved from the base portion<br>
30, by any suitable means, and the main reflector assembly 26 re-configured as required.<br>
A first configuration of the main reflector assembly 26 is illustrated in the plan view of<br>
Figure 8, in which the top reflector 28 is not shown. The configuration comprises ten<br>
reflector portions 32, 32', 32" arranged around the periphery of the base aperture,<br>
symmetrically about the central axis AB.<br>
Two end reflectors 32" are positioned adjacent each other, symmetrically on either side of<br>
the central axis AB, opposite the lamp adjustment aperture 38. The two end reflectors 32'<br>
arc arranged with the reflector surfaces feeing the aperture 38 in the direction of the central<br>
axis generally from B to A. Hence, in operation the end reflectors 32" reflect light from the<br>
lamp 22 back onto the side reflectors 32,32' as well as through the opening 34.<br>
Four of the wider side reflectors 32 and two of the narrower side reflectors 30' arc arranged<br>
symmetrically about the central axis AB, forming an approximately semi-elliptical arc around<br>
the periphery of the opening 34 centred on the lamp adjustment aperture 38. The two<br>
narrower side reflectors 32' are located at the ends of the arc farthest from the lamp<br>
adjustment aperture 38. The reflector surfaces at the centre of the arc are arranged to face<br>
approximately 45° to the central axis AB, in the general direction of A to B. Hence, in<br>
operation the arc reflects most of the light from the lamp 22, over a relatively wide angle in a<br>
general direction away from the adjustment aperture 38. The largest proportion of the light<br>
reflected is reflected at approximately 45° to the central axis AB.<br>
Two further of the wider side reflectors 32 are positioned between the ends of the arc and the<br>
end reflectors 32". These side reflectors are positioned inwardly relative to the other<br>
reflector portions. Hence, in operation the two further side reflectors 32 reflect aportion of<br>
the light at a wide angle (~60C to ~70°) relative to the central axis in the general direction of<br>
the adjustment aperture 38, mat is in a direction generally from B to A of the central axis.<br>
Figure 9 shows an approximate light pattern produced by the reflector configuration shown in<br>
Figure 8. The light from the lamp is reflected symmetrically about the central axis AB. Most<br>
of the light is reflected by the arc of side reflectors over a wide angle generally in the<br>
direction A to B, but mostly at 45° to the central axis AB to produce major extended areas as<br>
seen generally at 84. Similarly the two further side reflectors reflect a large proportion of the<br>
light at a wide angle (-60* to -70°) relative to the central axis in the general direction of B to<br>
A to produce minor extended areas as seen generally at 86.<br>
The lighting pattern given by the first configuration is of particular application in streetlights<br>
for lighting a wide road and pavement area. The luminaire being assembled such that the<br>
major extended areas 84 light the road and the minor extended areas 86 light the pavement.<br>
A second configuration of the main reflector assembly 28 is seen most clearly in the plan<br>
view of Figure 10. The configuration comprises nine reflector portions 32, 32" arranged<br>
around the periphery of the base aperture, symmetrically about the central axis AB.<br>
A single end reflector portion 32" is positioned symmetrically on the central axis AB,<br>
opposite the lamp adjustment aperture 38. The end reflector portion 32" is arranged with the<br>
reflector surface facing the lamp mounting portion hi the direction of the central axis from B<br>
to A. Hence, hi operation the end reflector 32' reflects light from the lamp 22 back onto me<br>
side reflectors 32 as well as through the central opening 34 in the base portion.<br>
Eight of the wider side reflectors 32 are arranged such that die reflector surfaces form two<br>
shallow arcs each made up of four side reflectors 32. The arcs are located symmetrically on<br>
either side of the central axis AB as seen in Figure 10. Hence, in operation the second<br>
configuration reflects light in an elongated axial pattern, as can be seen in Figure 11, suited to<br>
illustrating a roadway of conventional width.<br>
Whilst bom of the illustrated configurations provide a li ght pattern that is symmetrical about<br>
the central axis AB, this need not be the case and the reflector portions 32, 32', 32" can be<br>
arranged to provide a non-symmetrical li ght geometry. This might be useful when a lamp is<br>
to be positioned close to a wall for example or in order to avoid light pollution in one<br>
direction.<br>
The ability to mount a number of differently configured reflector portions independently on a<br>
base member provides a reflector assembly 26 that can be used to produced various lighting<br>
geometries whilst at the same time ensuring that each reflector portion remains correctly<br>
focused for the lamp. This provides a very flexible and efficient reflector construction that<br>
can be easily adapted to meet different lighting requirements-<br>
Whereas the invention has been described in relation to -what is presently considered to be the<br>
most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not<br>
limited to the disclosed arrangements but rather is intended to cover various modifications<br>
and equivalent constructions included within the spirit and scope of the invention. For<br>
example, whilst it is preferred that all the reflector portions making up the reflector assembly<br>
arc mountable to the base portion in any of a plurality of discrete positions in order to ensure<br>
the greatest possible flexibility, it may be acceptable in certain applications for one or more<br>
of the reflector portions to be mountable to the base portion in only one predetermined<br>
position or indeed formed as an integral part of me base portion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
