    (C)  1-1  Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome  Chuo-ku  Tokyo 1038338         Japan<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and themanner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 [0001]<br>
 	The present invention relates to an acetylene generating facility  a method of controlling an acetylene generating facility  and a method of producing acetylene gas.<br><br>
RELATED ART<br>
 	Long-known methods of industrially producing acetylene are such as allowing calcium carbide (CaC2  simply referred to as “carbide”  hereinafter) to react with water  based on wet process or dry process.  The dry process needs addition of 10-fold equivalence or more of water relative to carbide  and also needs a labor-consuming treatment of a mixture of by-produced slaked lime and water.  The dry process has  therefore  been in the mainstream in these days.<br>
 [0003]<br>
 	One known dry-type acetylene generating facility is an acetylene facility described for example in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. S31-7838 (Patent Document 1).  In this facility  carbide is mixed with 1.9 to 3 times the stoichiometric amount of water in an acetylene generator  and the mixture under stirring is sequentially dropped onto shelf plates provided in the acetylene generator.  Acetylene gas generated in the acetylene generator is collected through an output duct provided to the upper portion of the generator. Patent Document 1 describes that the amount of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator during the operation is controlled based on a measured value of grade of source carbide  and the amount of supply of carbide is controlled based on measured values of flow rate of generated acetylene and the grade of carbide.  It is also described that an automatic control is adoptable  by which both of the amount of supply of water and the amount of supply of carbide may be controlled with each other  while keeping a proportional relation in between.<br>
 [0005]<br>
 	However  the method of controlling the amount of supply of water based on the measured value of grade of source carbide  such as described in Patent Document 1 is insufficient in terms of stability of control.  More specifically  it is anticipated that the method would be insufficient to cope with sharp changes in temperature of water to be supplied  or rapid changes in reaction conditions possibly induced by input of source carbide having different grades.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 [0023]<br>
 	Embodiments of the present invention will be explained referring to the attached drawings.  It is to be understood that the drawings are merely schematic  and do not exactly depict actual relations between thickness and average dimension  ratio of the individual layers and so forth.  Dimensional relations or ratios may vary among the drawings.  The embodiments described below are merely directed to exemplify apparatus and method for implementing the technical spirit of the present invention  so that the technical spirit of the present invention by no means limits the materials  geometries  structures and arrangement of the components to those described below.<br>
 [0024]<br>
(First Embodiment)<br><acetylene generating facility><br>
 	The acetylene generating facility according to the first embodiment of the present invention comprises  as illustrated in FIG. 1  an acetylene generator 1 generating acetylene gas by allowing carbide to react with water  a supply tank 2 supplying carbide to the acetylene generator 1  a water supply unit 3 supplying water to the acetylene generator 1  a gas flow rate detector 4 detecting amount of generation of acetylene gas output from the acetylene generator 1  a gas temperature detector 5 detecting temperature of acetylene gas output from the acetylene generator 1  and a control device 6 controlling flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1  based on the amount of generation of acetylene gas and the temperature of acetylene gas.<br>
 [0025]<br>
 	To the acetylene generator 1  connected are an acetylene purification unit 7 purifying acetylene gas generated in the acetylene generator 1  and a by-produced slaked lime output unit 8 outputting by-produced slaked lime generated in the acetylene generator 1.  The acetylene purification unit 7 has a dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a  a desulfurization tower 7b and a water seal trap 7c  and purifies acetylene gas generated in the acetylene generator 1.  The by-produced slaked lime output unit 8 has a ripening unit 8a  a seal tank 8b  and an inclined screw conveyor 8c  and is configured to further proceed reaction of an unreacted portion of carbide  contained in the by-produced slaked lime produced in the acetylene generator 1  and to discharge the by-produced slaked lime out from the system.<br>
 [0026]<br>
 	As illustrated in FIG. 1  the acetylene generator 1 configures a multi-stage stirring system  and generally has a cylindrical geometry.  The acetylene generator 1 ensures a good conversion efficiency by virtue of its configuration  in which most part of reaction is completed in upper stages  whereas stirring and mixing is done in lower stages for further reaction of unreacted carbide.  For example  the acetylene generator 1 illustrated in FIG. 1 has a 10-stage configuration  in which the first and second stages are assigned to reaction stages 12a  12b  and the third to tenth stages are assigned to mixing stage 13.<br>
 [0027]<br>
 	The reaction stages 12a  12b are connected with input ports 11a  11b through which carbide is input.  The input ports 11a  11b are connected with screw feeders 21a  21b  respectively  through which carbide is fed from the supply tank 2 into the reaction stages 12a  12b.  The reaction stages 12a  12b are connected with a plurality of water sprayers 15a  15b.  Each of the water sprayers 15a  15b has six spray nozzles  twelve in total.  In the cylindrical acetylene generator 1 illustrated in FIG. 1  the spray nozzles are arranged by twos  in the circumferential direction from the input ports 11a  11b  so as to bring water sprayed from the spray nozzles into contact with carbide.  Flow rate of water sprayed from the spray nozzles are independently adjustable for each water sprayers.  In this configuration  one possible control may be such as increasing the flow rate through the nozzles arranged closer to the input ports 11a  11b for introducing the source material  and decreasing the flow rate through the nozzles more distant therefrom  and another possible control may be such as starting water spraying  only after the source material  input at the start-up of the acetylene generator 1  reached below the water sprayers 15a  15b.<br>
 [0028]<br>
 	The water supply unit 3 may be configured by a pump  for example.  The water supply unit 3 may be connected with a switching unit (not illustrated) switching water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1  among river water  well water  industrial water and recycled water in the acetylene generating facility  depending on needs.  The water supply unit 3 is electrically connected to the control device 6  by which the flow rate of water supplied by the supply unit 3 (flow rate of water supplied through the water sprayers 15a  15b) is controlled.<br>
 [0029]<br>
 	The gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5 are respectively connected to the output port side of the acetylene generator 1.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1  the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5 are connected to the output port of the water seal trap 7c of the acetylene purification unit 7  so as to detect flow rate and temperature of acetylene gas which flows through a piping of the output port of the water seal trap 7c.  Positions of the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5 are not specifically limited  so long as they reside on the downstream side of the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a.  Paths 18 which connect the acetylene generator 1 and the acetylene purification unit 7 may not be suitable for the measurement  due to their highly dusty and steamy moist environment.  The gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5 are electrically connected to the control device 6  wherein the flow rate and the temperature detected by the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5 are stored by the control device 6 in a continuous or temporary manner.<br>
 [0030]<br>
 	The supply tank 2 stocks carbide preliminarily crushed by a crusher facility.   Too small grain size of carbide may excessively elevate the temperature enough to make a side reaction more likely to proceed  whereas too large grain size may prevent the reaction from proceeding to a sufficient degree.  Carbide is therefore crushed so as to have an average grain size of 4 mm or smaller  and preferably 0.8 to 1.3 mm or around.  The supply tank 2 is fully filled with the source material  and is sealed with an inert gas such as nitrogen gas.  The inside of the supply tank 2 is preferably kept at a pressure higher by approximately 0.3 to 0.5 kPa than that in the acetylene generator 1  by filling an inert gas such as nitrogen gas.  In this way  the acetylene gas produced in the acetylene generator 1 may be prevented from flowing backward to the supply tank 2  and thereby safety of the acetylene generating facility may be improved.<br>
 [0031]<br>
 	The control device 6 controls the acetylene generator 1  the supply tank 2  the water supply unit 3  the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5.  The control device 6 has a condition storage unit 61  a correction unit 62  a calculator unit 63  a comparator unit 64 and a regulator unit 65.  The condition storage unit 61 stores conditions necessary for controlling the acetylene generating facility  such as operational conditions of the individual facilities  and information including reference values  equations used for calculating flow rate of water necessary for the acetylene generator 1 (referred to as “required supply flow rate”  hereinafter)  relational data among various measurement parameters  and multiplying factor of supply of water necessary for calculating the required supply flow rate.<br>
 [0032]<br>
 	The correction unit 62 corrects a measured value of the amount of generation of acetylene gas (flow rate) detected by the gas flow rate detector 4  using a measured value of the temperature of acetylene gas detected by the temperature detector 5.  More specifically  the correction unit 62 corrects a measured value obtained by the gas flow rate detector 4 into a corrected gas flow rate (15°C  101.325 kPa  on the basis of dry gas) which represents a volume of dry acetylene gas  using the detected temperature of acetylene gas  typically according to the equations (1) to (3) below:<br>
	Corrected amount of gas [m3/h]<br>
	=Measured value [m3/h]×(P0+PDG)÷P0×(T0+15)÷(T0+t)×VC2H2(t)<br>
									???(1)<br>
	VC2H2(t) [-]={P0+PDG-E(t)}/(P0+PDG) 		???(2)<br>
	E(t) [kPa(abs)]=0.611×10^{7.5t/(t+237.3)}  	???(3)<br>
where  P0 [kPa(abs)] represents standard pressure (=101.325 kPa)  T0 [K] represents standard temperature (=273.15°C)  t [°C] represents temperature of acetylene gas detected by the gas temperature detector 5  VC2H2(t) represents volume fraction [-] of acetylene at t [°C]  PDG [kPa(G)] represents pressure inside the water seal trap 7c  and E(t) [kPa(abs)] represents saturated water vapor pressure at t[°C]  known as an approximating equation by Tetens (1930).<br>
 [0033]<br>
 	Exemplary relational data among the acetylene gas temperature t  the saturated water vapor pressure E(t)  and the volume fraction of acetylene VC2H2(t) are shown in Table 1.  The table shows an exemplary case where the pressure PDG of the water seal trap 7c was fixed to 2.0 kPa(G).  The correction unit 62 may calculate the corrected gas flow rate  by determining the volume fraction VC2H2 of acetylene based on a  measured value (t[°C]) of the temperature of acetylene gas and relational data shown in Table 1  and by calculating the corrected gas flow rate according to the equation (1)  using the thus-determined volume fraction VC2H2 of acetylene.<br>
[Table 1]<br>
Temperature<br>
t [°C]	Saturated water vapor pressure E(t) [kPa]	Volume fraction of acetylene<br>
VC2H2(t) [-]<br>
0	0.61	0.9941<br>
10	1.23	0.9881<br>
20	2.34	0.9774<br>
30	4.24	0.9589<br>
40	7.38	0.9286<br>
50	12.34	0.8806<br>
 [0034]<br>
 	The calculator unit 63 calculates the required supply flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1  using the corrected amount of generation of acetylene gas calculated by the correction unit 62.<br>
	Given now that one mol of carbide (64.1 g) is reacted with two mol of water (36 g)  23.4 L of acetylene gas (15°C  on the basis of 101.325 kPa) generates  according to the equation (4).<br>
	CaC2+2H2O?C2H2+Ca(OH)2    ???(4)<br>
As may be understood from the equation (4)  since 1.538 g (1.538 mL) of water is necessary for producing one liter of acetylene gas  so that a theoretical flow rate of water supply based on the amount of generation of acetylene gas may be given by the equation (5) below.<br>
	Theoretical flow rate of water supply [m3/h]<br>
=1.538×amount of gas production [m3/h]  ???(5)<br>
However  in an actual process  water to be reacted will vaporize due to heat of reaction  and water is also trapped in the by-produced slaked lime.  Taking now the amount of vaporization of water due to heat of reaction and the amount of water trapped in the by-produced slaked lime into account  the required supply flow rate is given by the equation (6) below.  “Multiplying factor of supply of water” in the equation (6) is a numerical value representing how much larger volume of water is necessary relative to the theoretical flow rate of water supply (stoichiometric volume).<br>
	Required supply flow rate [m3/h]<br>
	=1.538×amount of gas generation [m3/h]× multiplying factor of supply of water ???(6)<br>
	The calculator unit 63 calculates the required supply flow rate  by substituting a value of the corrected amount of gas corrected by the correction unit 62  for the “amount of gas generation” of the equation (6).  While the multiplying factor of supply of water may slightly vary typically depending on the grade of carbide  a reference value of 3.00±0.20[-] is set in this embodiment.<br>
 [0035]<br>
 	The comparator unit 64 compares the required supply flow rate calculated by the calculator unit 63 with the reference value stored in the condition storage unit 61.  “Reference value” may be defined as a value of actual flow rate of water supply during the operation  or the value with a certain allowance (for example  supply flow rate±5%).  The regulator unit 65 increases or decreases the flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1  so as to adjust the flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 to the required supply flow rate  when the required supply flow rate does not match the reference value.<br>
 [0036]<br><method of controlling water supply><br>
 	A method of controlling water supply to the acetylene generating facility in this embodiment will be explained  referring to the flow chart shown in FIG. 2.<br>
 [0037]<br>
 	In step S101  information necessary for the operation  including a desired volume of gas production  multiplying factor and reference value  are input to the condition storage unit 61.  If there are no changes to be made  previously entered values are kept.  Next  in step S102  temperature and flow rate of the generated acetylene gas are detected by the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5  and the results of detection are stored in the condition storage unit 61.  In step S103  the correction unit 62 of the control device 6 corrects a measured value of the amount (flow rate) of generation of acetylene gas detected by the gas flow rate detector 4  according to the equations (1) to (3)  using a measured value of the temperature of acetylene gas detected by the gas temperature detector 5  then the condition storage unit 61 stores the result of correction.  The correction unit 62 may alternatively determine the volume fraction of acetylene VC2H2  based on a measured value of the temperature of acetylene gas and relational data shown in Table 1  and then calculate the corrected gas flow rate according to the equation (1)  using the thus-determined volume fraction of acetylene VC2H2.<br>
 [0038]<br>
 	In step S104  the calculator unit 63 reads the corrected gas flow rate corrected by the correction unit 62 and a value of multiplying factor of water supply out from the condition storage unit 61  calculates the required supply flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 according to the equation (6)  and stores the result of calculation to the condition storage unit 61.<br>
 [0039]<br>
 	In step S105  the comparator unit 64 reads the reference value and the required supply flow rate of water calculated by the calculator unit 63 out from the condition storage unit 61  and compares the required supply flow rate and the reference value.  If the required supply flow rate matches the reference value  the process returns back to step S101.  If the required supply flow rate does not match the reference value  the regulator unit 65 increases or decreases  in step S106  the flow rate of water so as to regulate it to the required supply flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1.  After completion of the regulation of flow rate in step S106  the process returns back to step S101.  The amount of supply of water may be controlled in a continuous manner  by repeating steps S101 through S106.<br>
 [0040]<br>
 	According to the method of controlling an acetylene generating facility of the first embodiment  the amount of generation and the temperature of acetylene gas may be detected in a real-time manner by the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5  and the supply flow rate of water from the water supply unit 3 is automatically controlled by the control device 6 based on the results of detection.  Accordingly  the water supply to the acetylene generator 1 may be controlled in a more precise manner as compared with the conventional method in which the control was based on the grade of source carbide  so that the generator 1 may be re-conditioned in a rapid and appropriate manner  even if the different grade of carbide were input enough to induce sharp changes in the reaction  and thereby acetylene gas may be generated in a more stable manner.<br>
 [0041]<br><method of producing acetylene gas><br>
 	Next  an exemplary method of producing acetylene gas using the acetylene gas generating facility illustrated in FIG. 1 will be explained.<br>
 [0042]<br>
1.  Material Feeding Process<br>
	Carbide preliminarily crushed by a crusher facility is input from the bottom portion of a hopper (not illustrated)  while being conveyed with the aid of a screw conveyor  bucket conveyor  flow conveyor or the like  into the supply tank 2.  During the operation  the supply tank 2 is fed so as to be fully filled up all the time  and is sealed with an inert gas such as nitrogen gas.  Carbide is fed from the bottom portion of the  supply tank 2  with the aid of the screw feeders 21a  21b  into the acetylene generator 1.<br>
 [0043]<br>
2.  Acetylene Generating Process<br>
	Carbide is input through the input ports 11a  11b into the acetylene generator 1 and dropped onto the shelf plates in the first stage and the second stage  and diffused and conveyed towards the center  with the aid of a plurality of stirring blades (not illustrated) attached to a rotating arm (not illustrated) which rotates around a rotating shaft 17.  Carbide is mixed with mist-like sprayed water  and falls around the circumference of the rotating shaft onto a shelf plate in the third stage  while generating acetylene gas.  In the third stage  carbide is conveyed  while keeping the reaction  from the center portion towards the outer circumference  in the direction inverted from that in the first stage.  Thereafter  an unreacted portion of carbide and by-produced slaked lime successively move downwards while repeating the zigzag travel  and complete the reaction in the acetylene generator 1 in the bottom stage thereof.  Temperature of the inside of the generator 1 is preferably controlled to 140°C or lower  and preferably 90 to 130°C or around  in order to avoid explosive decomposition of acetylene.  Acetylene gas is then sent to the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a of the acetylene purification unit 7  and the by-produced slaked lime is sent to the by-produced slaked lime output unit 8.  In this embodiment  in the acetylene generating process  the flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 is automatically controlled to an appropriate value  by the control device 6 described in the above.<br>
 [0044]<br>
3.  Dust Scrubbing <br>
 	Acetylene gas generated in the generator 1 is sent to the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a.  In this process  two ribbon screws are preferably installed in a vertically aligned manner on the upstream side of the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a  so as to prevent the by-produced slaked lime having large grain size from entering the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a  and so as to push such slaked lime back to the generator 1 while keeping a path of gas.  Acetylene gas entering the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a has a temperature of 80 to 95°C or around  and entrains dusty slaked lime which cannot be removed by the ribbon screws.  The dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a is partitioned into a spray chamber on the lower stage and a packed chamber on the upper stage having a packing filled therein.  The dusty slaked lime contained in acetylene gas  fed from the lower stage of the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a  is washed off by the mist-like sprayed water  and the acetylene gas is cooled while traveling upward in the spray chamber.  The acetylene gas further flows upwards while meandering through the packing having a geometry of ring  pellet  honeycomb or the like.  Cooling water is sprayed from the top of the packed chamber  thereby a residual portion of the dusty slaked lime  which remained unwashed in the spray chamber  is removed as the acetylene gas travels through the packed chamber.  The gas is further cooled down to normal temperature.  Temperature of effluent water is preferably kept at 70 to 80°C  in order to prevent loss of acetylene gas possibly caused by dissolution of acetylene gas into water during the travel through the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a.<br>
 [0045]<br>
4.  Desulfurization<br>
 	Acetylene traveled through the dust-scrubbing cooling tower 7a then enters the desulfurization tower 7b.  Since the source carbide generally contains calcium sulfide as an impurity  so that also hydrogen sulfide generates by the reaction with water in the acetylene generator 1.  Hydrogen sulfide is then removed by using an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (referred to as “aqueous NaOH solution”  hereinafter) in the desulfurization tower 7b.  The desulfurization tower 7b has a packing filled therein.  A small amount of hydrogen sulfide contained in the acetylene gas reacts with the aqueous NaOH solution sprayed from the top of the desulfurization tower 7b  while meandering upward through the desulfurization tower 7b  and washed off in the form of sodium sulfide.  Amount of use of the aqueous NaOH solution may be reduced by collecting the used solution into a desulfurization tank  and by recycling it until the desulfurization effect is exhausted.<br>
 [0046]<br>
5.  Water Seal Trap<br>
 	The acetylene gas after desulfurization is then guided to the water seal trap 7c for preventing backward flow.  The water seal trap 7c is connected  to a path on the output port side thereof  with the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5  by which the temperature and the flow rate of the generated acetylene gas are measured.  After passing through the water seal trap 7c  the acetylene gas is sent to a gas holder for storage.<br>
 [0047]<br>
6.  By-Produced Slaked Lime Output Process<br>
 	On the other hand  slaked lime by-produced in the acetylene generating process is introduced to the by-produced slaked lime output unit 8 comprising the ripening unit 8a  the seal tank 8b  and the inclined screw conveyor 8c  through which an unreacted portion of carbide contained in the by-produced slaked lime generated in the acetylene generator 1 is made further react  and thereafter the by-produced slaked lime is discharged out from the system.<br>
 [0048]<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br><acetylene generating facility><br>
 	An acetylene generating facility of the second embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 is different from the acetylene generating facility illustrated in FIG. 1  in that the facility has a water temperature detector 9 for detecting temperature of water supplied from the water supply unit 3  and in that the control device 6 controls the flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 based on three measured parameters  which are the amount of generation of acetylene gas detected by the gas flow rate detector 4  the temperature of acetylene gas detected by the gas temperature detector 5  and  the temperature of water detected by the water temperature detector 9.<br>
 [0049]<br>
 	The water temperature detector 9 may be any sort of instrument capable of detecting the temperature of water to be supplied  without special limitation.  The water temperature detector 9 is electrically connected to the control device 6  and the temperature detected by the water temperature detector 9 is recorded by the control device 6 in a continuous or manner or at certain intervals.<br>
 [0050]<br>
  	As shown by the equations (5) and (6)  the required supply flow rate may be calculated by multiplying the theoretical supply flow rate by the multiplying factor of water supply.  The multiplying factor of water supply may be set  taking the water content of the by-produced slaked lime obtained by reaction between carbide and water carbide  and a loading state and so forth of a stirrer of generator 1 into account  while being generally assumed as approximately 3.00 as the reference.  However  if the temperature of water supplied from the water supply unit 3 largely varies  the change may affect vaporization of water in the generator 1  and may thereby largely change the water content of the by-produced slaked lime even under the same multiplying factor of water supply.  This may result in a water-excessive or water-deficient state in the acetylene generator 1  and may induce overload of the stirrer  increase in the amount of unreacted calcium carbide  or leakage of slaked lime.  In particular  for the case where types of water supply is switched during the operation (for example  switching from recycled water to industrial water)  changes in the temperature of supplied water may heavily affect the facility.<br>
 [0051]<br>
 	In the acetylene generating facility of the second embodiment  the correction unit 62 not only has the functions explained in the first embodiment  but also corrects the multiplying factor of water supply to a more appropriate value  based on the temperature of water (water supply temperature) detected by the water temperature detector 9.  For example  the correction unit 62 corrects the amount of vaporization of water according to the equation (7) using the detected temperature of water  and then corrects the multiplying factor of water supply to a more appropriate value using the corrected amount of vaporization of water.  More specifically  the corrected multiplying factor of water supply may be determined by calculating a difference between the average temperature of water supply in the normal state and a measured value of temperature of water supply  so as to find a difference of heat capacity (specific heat×temperature) of water to be supplied  and by converting the result into latent heat of vaporization.<br>
	Corrected multiplying factor of water supply [-]<br>
=multiplying factor of water supply (before correction)<br>
×{1+(t-t0)×4.186÷2254} ???(7)<br>
In the equation (7)  t [°C] represents a measured value of water supply  t0 [°C] represents average temperature of water supply in the normal state  4.186 [kJ/kg?°C] is specific heat of water  and 2254 [kJ/kg] is latent heat of vaporization of water.<br>
 [0052]<br>
 	The correction unit may alternatively be configured so as to correct the multiplying factor of water supply to a more appropriate value  if the temperature of water varied to a certain degree or more (for example  5°C or more  10°C or more  and 20°C or more)  based on relational data between the temperature of water supply and the multiplying factor of water supply  stored in the condition storage unit 61 as shown in Table 2.  An exemplary relation between the water supply temperature and the multiplying factor of water supply is shown in Table 2.<br>
  [Table 2]<br>
Temperature of water supply [°C]	Multiplying factor of water supply (reference value=3.00)<br>
Lowered by 20°C	-0.11<br>
Lowered by 10°C	-0.06<br>
Lowered by 5°C	-0.03<br>
Elevated by 5°C	+0.03<br>
Elevated by 10°C	+0.06<br>
Elevated by 20°C	+0.11<br>
 [0053]<br>
 	The calculator unit 63 calculates the required supply flow rate  by substituting the result of correction made by the correction unit 62 for the equation (6).  The acetylene generator 1 may  therefore  be controlled in a more precise manner  since the required supply flow rate is calculated based on three parameters  including the amount of generation of acetylene gas  the temperature of acetylene gas  and the temperature of water  as described in the above.<br>
 [0054]<br><method of controlling water supply><br>
 	Next  a method of controlling water supply to the acetylene generating facility of the second embodiment will be explained  referring to the flow chart shown in FIG. 4.<br>
 [0055]<br>
 	In step S201  information necessary for the operation  including a desired volume of gas production  multiplying factor and reference value  are input to the condition storage unit 61.  If there are no changes to be made  previously entered values are kept.  Next  in step S202  temperature and flow rate of the generated acetylene gas are detected by the gas flow rate detector 4 and the gas temperature detector 5  temperature of water supplied from the water supply unit 3 is detected by the water temperature detector 9  and results of detection are stored in the condition storage unit 61.  In step S203  the correction unit 62 corrects a measured value of the amount of generation (flow rate) of acetylene gas detected by the gas flow rate detector 4  according to the equation (1)  using a measured value of the detected temperature of acetylene gas detected by the gas temperature detector 5  and stores the result of correction (corrected gas flow rate) in the condition storage unit 61.  The correction unit 62 may alternatively determine the  volume fraction of acetylene VC2H2  based on a measured value of the temperature of acetylene gas and relational data shown in Table 1  and then calculate the corrected gas flow rate using the thus-determined volume fraction of acetylene VC2H2.<br>
 [0056]<br>
 	In step S204  the correction unit 62 further reads the temperature of water detected by the water temperature detector 9  out from the condition storage unit 61  and corrects the amount of vaporization of water according to the equation (7) using the detected temperature of water  then calculates the corrected multiplying factor of water supply  and stores the result of correction into the condition storage unit 61.  The correction unit 62 may alternatively be configured so as to correct the multiplying factor of water supply to a more appropriate value  if the temperature of water varied to a certain degree or more (for example  5°C or more  10°C or more  and 20°C or more)  based on relational data between the temperature of water supply and the multiplying factor of water supply  stored in the condition storage unit 61 as shown in Table 2.<br>
 [0057]<br>
 	In step S205  the calculator unit 63 reads the corrected gas flow rate and the multiplying factor of water supply corrected by the correction unit 62  out from the condition storage unit 61  calculates the required supply flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 according to the equation (6)  and stores the result into the condition storage unit 61.  In step S206  the comparator unit 64 reads the reference value and the required supply flow rate of water calculated by the calculator unit 63 out from the condition storage unit 61  and compares the required supply flow rate and the reference value.  If the required supply flow rate matches the reference value  the step returns back to step S201.  If the required supply flow rate does not match the reference value  the regulator unit 65 increases or decreases  in step S207  the flow rate of water to be supplied to the acetylene generator 1 so as to regulate it to the required supply flow rate.  After completion of the regulation of flow rate in step S207  the process returns back to step S201.  The amount of supply of water may be controlled in a continuous manner  by repeating steps S201 through S207.<br>
 [0058]<br>
	According to the method of controlling an acetylene generating facility of the second embodiment  the temperature of water to be supplied  the amount of generation and the temperature of acetylene gas may be detected in a real-time manner by the gas temperature detector 5  the gas flow rate detector 4 and the water temperature detector 9  and the supply flow rate of water from the water supply unit 3 is controlled by the control device 6 based on the results of detection.  Accordingly  the water supply to the acetylene generator 1 may be controlled in a more precise manner as compared with the conventional method  so that the generator 1 may be re-conditioned in a rapid and appropriate manner  even under sharp changes in the temperature of water to be supplied or in the state of source material.<br>
