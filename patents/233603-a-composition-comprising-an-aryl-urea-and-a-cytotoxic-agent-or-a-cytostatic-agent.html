Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This is application claims priority to provisional application Serial No. 60/334,609, filed December 3. 2001.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to aryl urea compounds in combination withcytotoxic or cytostatic agents and their use in treating raf kinase mediated diseases such as cancer.<br>
Background of theInvention<br>
The p21oncogene, ras, is a major contributor to the development and progression of human solid cancers and is mutated in 30% of all human cancers (Bolton et al. Ann. Re. Med. Chem. 1994, 29, 165-174; Bos. Cancer Res. 1989, 49,4682-9). In its normal, unmutated form, the ras protein is a key element of the signal transduction cascade directed by growth factor receptors in almost all tissues (Avruch et ai, Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994, 19, 279-83). Biochemically, ras is a guanine nucleotide binding GTPase protein that cycles between a QTP-bound activated and a GDP-bound inactive form. It's endogenous GTPase activity is strictly self-regulated and is also controlled by other regulatory proteins. The endogenous GTPase activity of mutations is reduced. Therefore, the protein delivers consritutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as the enzyme raf kinase. This leads to the cancerous growth of the cells which cany these mutants (Magm:ison etal. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994, 5,247-53). It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of active ras by inhibiting the raf kinase signaling pathway via administradon of deacdvating antibodies to raf kinase or by co-expression of dominant negadve raf kinase or dominant negative MEK, the substrate of raf kinase, leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the norma! growth phenotype (see: Daum et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994, 19, 474-80; Friedman et al. J. Biol Chem. 1994, 269, 30105-8; Kocj et al. Nature 1991, 349, 426-28). These references have further indicated that inhibition of raf expression by antisense RNA blocks cell proliferation in membrane-associated<br><br><br>
oncogenes. Similarly, inhibition of raf kinase {by antisense oligodeoxynucieotides) has been correlated in vitro and in vivo with inhibition of the growth of a variety of human cancer types (Monia et al., Nat. Med. 1996, 2, 668-75).<br>
Therefore, compounds which can act as raf kinase inhibitors represent an important group of chemotherapeutic agents for use in the treatment of a variety of different cancer types.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Generally, it is the overall object of the present invention to provide cytotoxic and/or cytostaric agents in combination with aryl urea compound raf kinase inhibitors which will serve to (1) yield better efficacy in reducing the growth of a tumor or even eliminate the tumor as compared to administration of either agent alone, (2) provide for the administration of lesser amounts of the administered chemotherapeutic agents, (3) provide for a chemotherapeutic treatment that is well tolerated in the patient with fewer deletenous pharmacological complications than observed with single agent chemotherapies and certain other combined therapies, (4) provide for treating a broader spectrum of different cancer types in mammals, especially humans, (5) provide for a higher response rate among treated patients, (6) provide for a longer survival time among treated patients compared to standard chemotherapy treatments, (7) provide a longer time for tumor progression, and/or (8) yield efficacy and tolerability results at least as good as those of the agents used alone, compared to known instances where other cancer agent combinations produce antagonistic effects.<br>

Innotecan (CPT-1 1) is sold under the trade name of Camptosar® by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI. Irinotecan is a camptothecin or topoisomerase I inhibitor, While not being bound by a theory, it is believed that by blocking this enzyme in cells, damage occurs when the cell replicates, and the cancer growth is thus controlled. The cytotoxic effect is believed due to double-stranded DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the tertiary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38 (its active metabolite). Conversion of irinotecan to SN-38 is believed to occur in the liver. Irinotecan is typically administered by injection or via i.v. infusion.<br>
Vinorelbine (Vinorelbine tartrate) has the molecular formula<br>
ith a molecular weight of 1079.12 and is sold under the<br>
tradename of Navelbine® by Glaxo SmithKline, Research Triangle Park. Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid with antitumor activity. The chemical name is 3',4'-didehydro-4'deoxy-C-norvincaIeukoblastine [R-(R,R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1 :2)(salt)]. While not bound by a theory, the antitumor activity of vinorelbine is believed to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at the metaphase stage through its interaction with tubulin. Vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin dependent Ca++ transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. Vinorelbline is typically administered by intravenous injection (i.v.) or by other appropriate infusion techniques. Vinorelbine is typically prepared in normal saline, D5W or other compatible solutions.<br>
Gemcitabine is sold under the trade name Qemzar® (Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, IN). Gemzar is an antimetabolite related to cytarabine. Gemzar* is indicated for patients previously treated with 5-fluorouracil. Gemzar® is a pyrimidine analog that has a broad range of activity against solid tumors including but not limited to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung carcinomas. It is believed to be incorporated into DNA of fast growing cancer cells, affecting replication. Gemzar* is a nucleoside analogue which disrupts DNA synthesis in S-phase cells and blocks the progression of cells through the Gl/S phase boundary. Gemcitabine HC1 is believed to be metabolized by nucleoside<br>
11<br><br>
kinases to active diphosphate and triphosphate forms which inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and which competes with CTP for incorporation into DNA, respectively. Gemzar® is administered by intravenous injection (i.v.) or by other appropriate infusion techniques.<br>
Gefinitib is sold under the tradename Iressa* (ZD 1839, Astra-Zeneca). Iressa is a 4-anilinoquinazoline and is believed to inhibit kinase acitivity of the epidermal growth factor regulator (EGFR). Mechanism of action studies seem to indicate that Iressa is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of-EGFR and blocks autophosphorylation of the receptor when the receptor is stimulated by binding EGF or TGFa. Iressa is orally bioavailable and has demonstrated preclinal efficacy against tumor models that simultaneously express EGFR and one of its ligands, TGFa. Iressa has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of cell lines that overexpress either EGFR or Her2. In clinical trials, Iressa has been maintained p.o. on a continuous daily schedule at up to 800 mg/day.<br>
Doxorubicin (DOX) is sold under the tradename Adriamycin® (Adria). DOX is an anthracyjcine that is believed to intercalate in DNA and interact with DNA Topoisomerase II to induce double-stranded DNA breaks. DOX exhibits a broad spectrum of anti-tumor efficacy. DOX is clinically administered intravenously on an intermittent schedule. The primary route of elimination of DOX is through the bile with no enterohepatic circulation. The dose-limiting acute toxicity of DOX is myeiosuppresion. Other common, but not usually dose-limiting toxicities are gastrointestinal, alopecia, and local tissue damage/ulceration at the injection site due to extravasation of the drug.<br>
Paclitaxel is sold under the tradename Taxol® by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. Paclitaxel (53,20-Epoxy-l,2aA70JO(M3a-hexahyclroxvtax-l l-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2R.3S)- N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine) has the empiricai formula C47HsiNOj4 and a molecular weight of 853.9. It is highly lipophilic in water. Paclitaxei is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubles from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. While<br>
12<br><br>
not<br>
bound by a theory, it is believed that this stability results in the inhibition in the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Also, paclitaxel is believed to induce abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Paclitaxel is administered by intravenous injection or by other appropriate infusion techniques.<br>
These and other cytotoxic/cytostatic agents can be administered in the conventional formulations and regimens in which they are known for use alone.<br>
The aryt urea compound can inhibit the enzyme raf kinase. Further, these compounds can inhibit signaling of growth factor receptors. These compounds have been previously described in patent application, serial no. 09/425,228 filed October 26,1999 which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aryl urea compounds can be administered orally, dermally, parenterally, by injection, by inhalation or spray, sublingually, rectally or vaginally in dosage unit formulations. The term 'administration by injection' includes intravenous, intraarticular, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, as well as use of infusion techniques. Dermal administration may include topical application or transdermal administration. One or more compounds may be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceuticaUy acceptable carriers and if desired other active ingredients.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any suitable method • known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of diluents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceuticaUy acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate;<br>
13<br><br>
granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; and binding agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. These compounds may also be prepared in solid, rapidly released form.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions containing the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions may also be used.  Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan  monooleate.   The  aqueous  suspensions  may  also  contain  one  or  more preservatives, for example ethyl, or H-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Dispersible  powders   and  granules  suitable for preparation  of an  aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a<br>
14<br><br>
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The compounds may also be in the form of non-aqueous liquid formulations, e.g., oily suspensions which may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in polyethyleneglycol, a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or peanut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but<br>
15<br><br>
liquid at the rectal temperature or vaginal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum or vagina to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be administrated transdermally using methods known to those skilled in the art (see, for example: Chien; "Transdermal Controlled Systemic Medications"; Marcel Dekker, Inc.; 1987. Lipp et al. WO94/04157 3Mar94). For example, a solution or suspension of an aryl urea compound in a suitable volatile solvent optionally containing penetration enhancing agents can be combined with additional additives known to those skilled in the art, such as matrix materials and bacteriocides. After sterilization, the resulting mixture can be formulated following known procedures into dosage forms. In addition, on treatment with emulsifying agents and water, a solution or suspension of an aryl urea compound may be formulated into a lotion or salve.<br>
Suitable solvents for processing transdermal delivery systems are known to those skilled in the art, and include dimethylsulfoxide, lower alcohols such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, lower ketones such as acetone, lower carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, polar ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, lower hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane or benzene, or halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, trichlorotrifluoroethane, or trichlorofluoroethane. Suitable solvents may also include mixtures of one or more materials selected from lower alcohols, lower ketones, lower carboxylic acid esters, polar ethers, lower hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
Suitable penetration enhancing materials for transdermal delivery systems are known to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, monohydroxy or polyhydroxy alcohols such as ethandl, propylene glycol or benzyl alcohol, saturated or unsaturated Cg-Cis fatty alcohols such as lauryl alcohol or cetyl alcohol, saturated or unsaturated Cs-Cis fatty acids such as stearic acid, saturated or unsaturated fatty esters with up to 24 carbons such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tertbutyl or<br>

Cellulose ethers, derivatized polyethylenes, and silicates may also be used as matrix components. Additional additives, such as viscous resins or oils may be added to increase the viscosity of the matrix.<br>
The invention also encompasses kits for treating mammalian cancers. Such kits can be used to treat a patient with a raf kinase stimulated cancer as well as cancers not stimulated through raf kinase. The kit can comprise a single pharmaceutical formulation containing an aryl urea compound and a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent. Alternatively, the kit can comprise an aryl urea compound and a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent in separate formulations. The kit can also include instructions for how to administer the compounds to a patient with cancer in need of treatment. The kit can be used to treat different cancer types which include but are not limited to colon, prostate, leukemia, melanoma, hepatocellular, renal, head and neck, glioma, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, and mammary.<br>

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the particular method of administration will depend on a variety of factors, all of which are routinely considered when administering therapeutics.  It will also be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any given patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age of the patient, the body weight of the patient, the general health of the patient, the gender of the patient, the diet of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combinations, and the severity of the condition undergoing therapy. It will be further appreciated by one skilled in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the mode of treatment and the daily number of doses of an aryl urea compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof given for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests.<br>
The usefulness of a combination of an aryl urea compound with a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent is better than could have been expected from conventional knowledge of the effects of using either anticancer agent alone. For example, the combination therapy of an aryl urea compound with the cytotoxic agents irinotecan, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or paclitaxel has produced at least additive anti-tumor efficacy compared with that produced by administration of either the aryl urea compound or the cytotoxic agents administered alone. Generally, the use of cytotoxic and cytostatic agents in combination with aryl urea compound raf kinase inhibitors will serve to (1) yield better efficacy in reducing the  growth  of a  tumor  or  even  eliminate  the  tumor as   compared  to administration of a single chemotherapeutic agent, (2) provide for the administration of lesser amounts of the administered chemotherapeutic agents,    (3) provide for a chemotherapeutic treatment that is well tolerated in the patient with less deleterious pharmacological complications resulting from larger doses of single chemotherapies and certain other combined therapies, (4) provide for treating a broader spectrum of different cancer types in mammals, especially humans, (5) provide for a higher response rate among treated patients, (6) provide for a longer survival time among treated patients compared to standard chemotherapy treatments,   (7) provide a longer time for tumor progression, and/or (8) yield efficacy and tolerability results at least as good as those of<br>
18<br><br>
the   agents   used  alone,  compared to  known  instances  where  other  cancer agent combinations produce antagonist effects.<br>
The aryl urea compound can be administered to a patient at a dosage which can range from about 0.1 to about 300 mg/Kg of total body weight. The daily dose for oral administration will preferably be from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg of total body weight. The daily dosage  for administration by injection  which includes  intravenous,  intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injection as well as infusion techniques will preferably be from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg of total body weight.   The daily vaginal dosage regime will preferably be from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg of total body weight.   The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 to 300 mg administered between one to four times daily. The transdermal concentration will preferably be that required to maintain a daily dose of from 1 to 300 mg/kg. For all the above mentioned routes of administration, the preferred dosage is 0.1 to 300 mg/kg. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg of total body weight.<br>
The cytotoxic or cytostatic agent can be administered to a patient at a dosage which can range from about 0.1 to about 300 mg/kg of total body weight. Also, the agents can also be administered in conventional amounts routinely used in cancer chemotherapy.<br>
For both the aryl urea compound and the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent, the administered dosage of the compound may be modified depending on any superior or unexpected results which may be obtained as routinely determined with this invention.<br>
The aryl urea compound can be administered orally, topically, parenterally, rectally, by inhalation, and by injection. Administration by injection includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and parenterally as well as by infusion techniques. The aryl urea compound can be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and if desired other active ingredients. A preferred route of administration for the aryl urea compound is oral administration.<br>
19<br><br>
The cyto toxic or cytostatic agent can be administered to a patient orally, topically, parenterally, rectally, by inhalation, and by injection. Administration by injection includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and parenteraily as well as by infusion techniques. The agents can be administered by any of the conventional routes of administration for these compounds. The preferred route of administration for the cytotoxic/cytostatic agents using this invention is typically by injection which is the same route of administration used for the agent alone. Any of the cytotoxic or cytostatic agents can be administered in combination with an aryl urea compound by any of the mentioned routes of administration.<br>
For administering the aryl urea compound and the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent, by any of the routes of administration herein discussed, the aryl urea compound can be administered simultaneously with the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent. This can be performed by administering a single formulation which contains both the aryl urea compound and the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent or administering the aryl urea compound and the cytotoxic/cytostatic agents in independent formulations at the same time to a patient.<br>
Alternatively, the aryl urea compound can be administered in tandem with the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent. The aryl urea compound can be administered prior to the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent. For example, the ary] urea compound can be administered once or more times per day up to 28 consecutive days followed by administration of the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent. Also, the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent can be administered first followed by adminstration of the aryl urea compound. The choice of sequence administration of the aryl urea compound relative to the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent may vary for different agents. Also, the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent can be administered using any regimen which is conventionally used for these agents.<br>
20<br><br>
In another regimen of administration, the aryl urea compound and the cytotoxic/cytostatic agent can be administered once or more times per day on the day of administration.<br>
Any of the routes and regimens of administration may be modified depending on any superior or unexpected results which may be obtained as routinely determined with this invention.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way<br>

Tumor Lines<br>
The DLD-1 human colon carcinoma and the MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection Repository. The MX-1 human mammary tumor was obtained from the NCI tumor repository. Tumors were maintained as a serial in vivo passage of s.c. fragments (3x3 mm) implanted in the flank using a 12 gauge trocar. A new generation of the passage was initiated every three or four weeks.<br>
The NCI-H460 and A549 human non-small-cell lung carcinoma lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection Repository. The NCI-H460 cells were maintained and passaged in vitro using DMEM (GIBCO cat. # 11995-065: 500 mis) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences cat.# 12106-500M), 2mM L-glutamine ( GIBCO cat. # 25030-81), lOmM HEPES buffer (GIBCO cat# 15630-080) and penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO cat. # 15140-122: 5 mis/ 50 mis DMEM). The A549 cells were maintained and passaged using RPMI1640 media (GIBCO cat.# 11875-085: 1000ml) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences catj 12106-500M). All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a Fisher Scientific 610 COi incubator.<br>
Tumor Xenograft Experiments<br>
Female mice were implanted s.c. with DLD-1, MX-1 or Mia-PaCa-2 tumor fragments from an in vivo passage. Studies with the NCI-H460 and A549 cells were initiated by harvesting cells from an in vitro culture by adding Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO cat#25200-056 ) for 2 minutes followed by centrifugation of the cells into a pellet and resuspension in HBSS (GIBCO cat# 14025-092) to a final cell count of 3-5 x 107 viable cells/ml. A volume of O.lml of the cell suspension was injected s.c. in the right flank of each mouse. All treatment was initiated when all mice in the experiment had established tumors ranging in size from 100 to 150 mg. The general health of mice was monitored and mortality was recorded daily. Tumor dimensions and body weights were recorded<br>
23<br><br>
twice a week startij g with the first day of treatment. Animals were euthanized according<br>
i to Bayer IACUC guidelines. Treatments producing greater than 20% lethality and/or<br>
20% net body weight loss were considered 'toxic'.<br>
Tumor weights were calculated using the equation (/ x w2)/2, where / and w refer to the larger and smaller dimensions collected at each measurement. In each experiment, an evaluation endpoint was selected such that the median time for the tumors in the control group to attain that size was slightly greater than the duration of treatment. Anti-tumor efficacy was measured as the incidence of complete regressions (CR) defined as tumors that are reduced to below the limit of measurement (3 mm) in both length and width, partial regressions (PR) defined as tumors that are reduced by more than 50% but less than 100% of their initial size, and percent tumor growth suppression (%TGS). TGS is calculated by the equation [(T-C)/C] * 100, where T and C represent the times for the median tumors in the treated (T) and untreatred control (C) groups, respectively, to attain the evaluation size for that experiment.<br>
Results<br>
Combination of compound A and cytotoxic/cytastatic agents<br>
The most intensive combination chemotherapy anticipated in the clinical development of compound A for the treatment of cancer would involve daily administration of compound A administered throughout the period of time encompassing the intermittent administration of cytotoxic/cytostatic agents such as e.g., Camptosar®, Gemzar®, Navelbine®, or DOX that constitute the current clinical practice with each of these, agents. In order to explore the potential interactions of these agents, we modeled this anticipated clinical schedule in our preclinical model by superimposing the schedules of the individual agents (qd x 9 for compound A and q4d x 3 for Camptosar®, Gemzar®, Navelbine®, or DOX) with both therapies in each experiment starting on the same day. An alternative schedule of combination chemotherapy would consist of daily administration of compound A throughout the period of time encompassing the continuous administration of cytostatic agents such as Iressa®' In order to explore the potential interactions of these agents, the preclinical model was established by<br>
24<br><br>
superimposing the schedules of the individual agents (qd x 9 or 10 for both compound A and Lressa®). These schedules are termed 'Concurrent Therapy'. Each study consisted of an untreated control group of 10-20 animals and treated groups of 10 mice per group.<br>
Example 1<br>
In the first study, Camptosar® was administered i.p at 40 mg/kg/dose. Compound A was administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 80 mg/kg/dose. All treatment was initiated on Day 7 post-implant when all animals had small but established DLD-1 human colon tumor xenografts averaging 108 mg in size. Control rumors grew progressively in all animals with an average doubling time of 4.4 days. The evaluation endpoint used to calculate the growth delay parameters was time to three mass doublings. The median time for the tumors in the untreated control group to attain that size was 10.4 days.<br>
Camptosar® was well tolerated as a single agent with minimal weight loss and no lethality. The 40 mg/kg dose level produced a TGS of 71% with no complete or partial tumor regressions.<br>
Compound A was also well tolerated as a single agent producing no significant weight loss and no lethality at 80 mg/kg/dose. Compound A produced a TGS of 100%.<br>
There was no increase in weight loss and no lethality associated with the combination of Camptosar® with compound A. The anti-tumor efficacy of the concurrent therapy was at least additive producing a 229% TGS. This was associated with 3 PR's.<br>
Example 2<br>
The second study evaluated Gemzar®, administered i.p at 120 mg/kg/dose on a q4d x 3 schedule and compound A, administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 40 mg/kg/dose. All treatment was initiated on Day 7 post-implant when all animals had small but established MiaPaCa-human pancreatic tumor xenografts averaging 108 mg in size. Control tumors grew progressively in all animals with an average doubling time of 4.1 days. The evaluation endpoint used to calculate the growth delay parameters was time<br>
25<br><br>
to two mass doublings. The median time for the tumors in the untreated control group to attain that size was 5.8 days.<br>
Gemzar® was well tolerated as a single agent with no weight loss and no lethality. This dose level produced a TGS of 154% with no complete or partial tumor regressions. Compound A was also well tolerated as a single agent producing no significant weight loss and no lethality at the 80 mg/kg dose level. Compound A produced TGS of 112%.There was no increase in weight loss and no lethality associated with the combination of Gemzar® with Compound A. The anti-tumor efficacy of the concurrent therapy of 120 mg/kg Gemzar and 40 mg/kg Compound A was at least additive producing a 222% TGS. This was associated with 2 PR's.<br>
Example 3<br>
The third example demonstrates the effect of the combination of Compound A, administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 40 mg/kg/dose and Navelbine®, administered i.v. on a q4d x 3 schedule at 6.7 mg/kg/dose. All treatment was initiated on Day 6 post-implant when all animals had small but established NCI-H460 human non-small cell lung tumor xenografts averaging 100 mg in size. Control tumors grew progressively in all animals with an average doubling time of 3.1 days. The evaluation endpoint used to calculate the growth delay parameters was time to three mass doublings. The median time for the rumors in the untreated control group to attain that size was 7.4 days. The 6.7 mg/kg dose level of Navelbine was an approximate maximum tolerated dose producing an average 19% weight loss during the treatment period as a single agent. This was associated with a 32% TGS. Compound A was well tolerated with no significant weight loss and produced a TGS of 104%. The combination of these treatments was well tolerated with no lethality and an average weight loss of 14% (less than that produced by Navelbine alone). The antitumor efficacy of this combination was also approximately additive with a TGS of 133%.<br>
Example 4<br>
26<br><br>
The fourth example demonstrates the effect of the combination of Compound A, administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 40 mg/kg/dose and DOX, administered i.v, on a q4d x 3 schedule at 4 mg/kg/dose. All treatments were initiated on Day 6 post-implant when all animals had small but established tumors averaging 66 mg in size. Control tumors grew progressively ui all animals with an average doubling time of 3.7 days. The evaluation endpoint used to calculate the growth delay parameters was time to four mass doublings. The median time for the tumors in the untreated control group to attain that size was 14.5 days.The 4 mg/kg dose level of DOX was well tolerated producing an average 5% weight loss during the treatment period as a single agent. This was associated with a 43% TGS. Compound A was well tolerated with no significant weight loss and produced a TGS of 46%. The combination of these treatments was tolerated with no lethality and an average weight loss of 12%. The antitumor efficacy of this combination was also approximately additive with a TOS of 133%.<br>
Example 5<br>
The fifth example demonstrates the effect of the combination of Compound A, administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 80 mg/kg/dose and Gefmitib (Iressa®), administered p.o. on a qd x 9 schedule at 150 mg/kg/dose. All treatment was initiated on Day 15 post-implant when all animals had small but established A549 human non-small cell lung tumor xenografts averaging 110 mg in size. Control tumors grew progressively in all animals with an average doubling time of 10.5 days. The evaluation endpoint used to calculate the growth delay parameters was time to one mass doubling. The 150 mg/kg dose level of Iressa® was well tolerated producing no weight loss and no lethality during the treatment period as a single agent. This treatment was associated with a 101 % TS and 1 PR. Compound A was also well tolerated as a single agent with no weight loss or lethality and produced a TGS of 218% with 1 CR and 2 PRs. The combination of these treatments was tolerated with one non-specific death out of 10 mice and an average 10% weight loss. The antitumor efficacy of mis combination was approximately additive with a TGS of 314%. This treatment also produced 6 CR's and 3 PR's,<br>
