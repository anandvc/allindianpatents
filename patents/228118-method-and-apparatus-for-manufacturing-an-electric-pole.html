				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING AN<br>
ELECTRIC POLE<br>
Techinical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus of manufacturing an<br>
electric pole using a centrifugal casting, and more particularly, to an electric pole<br>
manufacturing apparatus having an improved distal end, capable of reducing the cost,<br>
arranging tensile cores corresponding to a design load, and providing a high quality<br>
of the electric pole, and a method of manufacturing the electric pole.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, an electric pole has a cylindrical shape having a slow gradient,<br>
and is manufactured to have various length of 7 to 17 m. One end of the electric<br>
pole, which is buried under the ground, is called as a proximal! end, while the other<br>
end is called as a distal end. The electric pole is mainly composed of concrete, and<br>
a frame consisting of tensile cores arranged in a longitudinal direction of the electric<br>
pole and iron wires wound around and attached to the circumferences of the tensile<br>
cores further is incorporated into the electric pole to increase the strength thereof.<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view illustrating the construction of a conventional<br>
apparatus of manufacturing an electric pole, and Figs. 2 and 3 are view illustrating a<br>
coupling structure of a tensile core applied to the conventional apparatus.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the conventional apparatus of manufacturing the electric<br>
pole has a structure capable of being divided a mold 20 into an opened mold and a<br>
closed mold.<br>
The mold 20 includes a proximal end plate 30 mounted to one end thereof for<br>
forming a proximal end 12, a proximal end tensile plate 32 spaced from the proximal<br>
end plate 30 at a constant spacing, and a proximal end tensile core fixing plate 34<br>
having a tensile core 64 with one side penetrating through a bottom surface of the<br>
proximal end tensile plate 32.<br>
The mold 20 further includes a distal end plate 40 mounted to one end thereof<br>
for forming a distal end 14, a distal end tensile plate 42 spaced from the distal end<br>
plate 40 at a constant spacing and coupled to a tension shaft 50, and a distal end<br>
tensile core fixing plate 44 having the tensile core 64 with the other side penetrating<br>
through an upper surface of the distal end tensile plate 32. The tension shaft 50 is<br>
rotatably engaged to an exterior tension through a bolt type, with the tensile shaft<br><br>
penetrating through a butt-end plate 46, and is fastened by a nut 52.<br>
The distal end plate 40, distal end tensile plate 42, proximal end plate 30, and<br>
proximal end tensile plate 32 form a hole, through which both sides of the tensile<br>
cores 64 arranged in a circle shape are penetrate.<br>
The mold 20 is provided on its outer circumference with a plurality of rings<br>
(not shown) which are contacted with a rotary roller and receive a rotary power from<br>
the rotary roller.<br>
The proximal end tensile core fixing plate 34 and the distal end tensile core<br>
fixing plate 44 are formed with a number of fastening holes 36 of a peanut shape so<br>
as to have a supporting force in a stage that the tensile cores 64 penetrate through the<br>
fixing plates 34 and 44, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The fastening hole 36 has a<br>
large-diameter portion 37 and a small-diameter portion 38.<br>
The tensile core 64 has a head 66 so that both end are inserted into the large-<br>
diameter portion 37 and the tensile core is caught to the fixing plate 34 by the head<br>
66.<br>
The operation of the conventional mold will now be described.<br>
First process<br>
A plurality of tensile cores 64 are cut to have a length of 400 to 500 mm<br>
longer than that of the electric pole 10, and then are arranged along a longitudinal<br>
direction of the electric pole. Slender iron wires are wound and welded around the<br>
surroundings of the tensile cores 64 to form a frame. Both ends of the tensile core<br>
64 arranged in a longitudinal direction in the frame are heated and pressurized to<br>
form the head 66.<br>
Second process<br>
A release agent is applied on the mold 20, and the both sides of the tensile<br>
core 64 penetrate through the distal end plate 40, distal end tensile plate 42, proximal<br>
end plate 30, and distal end tensile core 32, so that the head 66 of the tensile core 64<br>
is caught to the fastening hole 36 of the proximal end tensile core fixing plate 34 and<br>
the distal end tensile core fixing plate 44. And then, the frame prepared in the first<br>
process is seated on an opened mold 20.<br>
Third process<br>
In order to prevent the deformation of the entire mold when inputting the<br>
concrete into the mold 20, the tensile core 64 is strained by the tensioner. After that,<br><br>
At that time, the tensile core 64 is provided with tension sufficient for<br>
maintaining a straight line relative to the tension shaft 50. It is noted that if the<br>
tensile core 64 is pull under compulsion, the tensile core is stretched, so that the head<br>
66 and a portion adjacent to the small-diameter portion 38 soften to release the<br>
tension state.<br>
Fourth process<br>
The concrete of the electric pole 10 is treated through the steam cure using a<br>
boiler to have a desired demold strength.<br>
Fifth process<br>
After tensile cores 64 extended between the distal end plate 40 and the distal<br>
end tensile plate 42, and proximal end plate 30 and proximal end tensile plate 32 are<br>
cut using a welding rod, the electric pole 10 is transferred, and then the fine cut of<br>
the tensile cores 64 remained at the proximal end 12 and distal end 14 and the natural<br>
cure are performed to complete the electric pole 10.<br>
With the construction of the conventional electric pole manufacturing<br>
apparatus, there is a problem in that the tensile cores 64 are cut to have a length of<br>
about 400 to 500 mm longer than that of the electric pole 10 to stretch the tensile<br>
plate 64, thereby increasing the cost by a surplus length of the tensile core 64.<br>
There is another problem in that the head 66 of the tensile core 64 is inserted<br>
into the large-diameter portion 37 of the fastening hole 36, and is moved to the<br>
small-diameter portion 38, so that the head is supported by the portion adjacent to<br>
the small-diameter portion 38 and the large-diameter portion 37 is opened, thereby<br>
causing the shape of the distal end 14 of the electric pole to be poor.<br>
Specifically, after the head 66 of the tensile core 64 is passed through the<br>
large-diameter portion 37 of the fastening hole 36 formed in the distal end tensile<br>
core fixing plate 44, the head 66 is reached to the small-diameter portion 38 by<br>
slightly rotating the fixing plate 44. The head is caught by the portion adjacent to<br>
the small-diameter portion 38, thereby restraining the tensile plate 64.<br>
With the construction of which the large-diameter portion 37 is opened, since<br>
the concrete or moisture consisting the electric pole 10 is leaked through the<br>
clearance, causing the shape of the distal end 14 of the electric pole to be poor.<br>
In order to address the problem, in case of closing the exposed large-diameter<br>
portion with a separate member, the process is more complicated.<br>
The tensile core 64 is stretched with the construction of the fastening hole 36<br>
constraining the tensile core 64,  in which the large-diameter portion 37 is <br>
communicated with the small-diameter portion 38. The distal end tensile core<br>
fixing plate 44 may be moved based on the tensile plate 64, and the shape of the<br>
distal end 14 of the electric pole becomes poor.<br>
The is a further problem in that if a design load of the electric pole 10 is<br>
increased, it is impossible to arrange the tensile core 64 at the distal end 14 of a small<br>
diameter relative to that of the proximal end 12 of the electric pole 10.<br>
Specifically, if a length of the electric pole 10 is 16 m, a design load of the<br>
electric pole is 1300 kg, and a diameter of the distal end 14 is 220 mm, twelve tensile<br>
cores 64 having a diameter of 14 mm are required. At that time, a spacing of the<br>
tensile cores 64 is 40.58 mm.<br>
The fastening hole 36 formed in the distal end tensile core fixing plate 44 has<br>
the large-diameter portion 37 and the small-diameter portion 38. It is difficult to<br>
ensure an area forming twelve fastening holes 36 for arranging 12 tensile cores 64,.<br>
so that a ranging angle between the targe-diameter portion 37 and the small-diameter<br>
portion 38 from a center axis of the distal end tensile core fixing plate 44 may satisfy<br>
the design value. Therefore, it is impossible to manufacture the electric pole 10<br>
according to the design load.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
An electric pole manufacturing apparatus, generally indicated by a reference<br>
numeral 100 in Fig. 4, includes a mold 20 capable of taking an opened or closed<br><br>
mode, a tensile core 64 mounted on the mold for forming a frame 60, and means for<br>
maintaining the tensile core in a stretching state.<br>
The frame 60 is composed of the tensile core 64 arranged in a circle, and iron<br>
wires 62 spirally wound and welded around the tensile core 64, as shown in Figs. 5<br>
and 6.<br>
The tensile core 64 is provided on its one end with a head 66, and on its other<br>
end with a male threaded portion 680, as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
The mold 20 is provided on its outer circumference with a plurality of rings<br>
(not shown) which are contacted with a rotary roller and receive a rotary power from<br>
the rotary roller.<br>
The mold 20 includes a proximal end plate 30 mounted to one end thereof for<br>
forming a proximal end 12 of the electric pole 10, a proximal end tensile plate 32<br>
spaced from the proximal end plate 30 at a constant spacing, and a proximal end<br>
tensile core fixing plate 34 having a tensile core 64 with one side penetrating through<br>
a bottom surface of the proximal end tensile plate 32.<br>
The proximal end tensile core fixing plate 34 is formed with a number of<br>
fastening holes 36 having a large-diameter portion 37 for receiving the head 66 of<br>
the tensile core 64 and a small-diameter portion 38 having a diameter corresponding<br>
to that of the tensile core 64 and supporting a bottom surface of the head 66, so as to<br>
catch and fix the head 66 of the tensile core 64, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the mold 20 further includes a distal end plate 40<br>
mounted to one end thereof for forming a distal end 14 of the electric pole 10,<br>
through which the tensile core 64 penetrates, and a distal end tensile plate 42<br>
connected to a butt-end plate 46 using a nut 52 for coupling to a tension shaft 50<br>
lifted by a fastening force of the nut.<br>
The distal end tensile plate 42 and the distal end plate 40 are engaged to each<br>
other by coupling means, so that the tensile force is applied to the distal end plate 40<br>
by the rotation of the tension shaft 50.<br>
The coupling means has a coupling ring 200 of a dividable structure, and a<br>
holder for holding the distal end plate 40 and the distal end tensile plate 42 using the<br>
coupling ring 200. The holder encloses outer circumferences of the distal end plate<br>
40 and the distal end tensile plate 42 to form holding bosses 420 and 422. The<br>
coupling ring 200 is formed with a holding groove 220 receiving the holding bosses<br>
420 and 422.<br>
The distal end plate 40 coupled to the distal end tensile plate 42 for receiving<br><br>
the tensile force is formed with a plurality of female threaded holes 440 for receiving<br>
a male threaded portion 680 of the tensile core 64 and thus being fixed by tensile nut<br>
300.<br>
The number of female threaded holes 400 may be increased or decreased<br>
depending upon a diameter and number of the tensile core 64, each defined by the<br>
design load of the electric pole 10. The tensile nut 300 for fastening the tensile<br>
cores 64, which are arranged in a circle to dense the intervals between the tensile<br>
cores 64 inserted into the female threaded holes 440, consists of a long tensile nut<br>
320 and a short tensile nut 340, the long and short tensile nuts 320 and 340 being<br>
alternatively disposed.<br>
At that time, the long tensile nut 320 has a double height relative to that the<br>
short tensile nut 340. The reason is because after the short tensile nut 340 is<br>
fastened, the long tensile nut 320 is fastened or released using an impact wrench.<br>
Specifically, the long tensile nut 320 is fastened or released without inserting the<br>
impact wrench between the short and long tensile nuts.<br>
The operation of manufacturing the electric pole using the apparatus<br>
according to the present invention will now be described.<br>
First process<br>
A plurality of tensile cores 64 are cut to have a length of 250 to 300 mm<br>
shorter than that of the electric pole 10, and then are arranged along a longitudinal<br>
direction of the electric pole. Slender iron wires are wound and welded around the<br>
surroundings of the tensile cores 64 to form a frame 60. Both ends of the tensile<br>
core 64 arranged in a longitudinal direction in the frame are heated and pressurized<br>
to form the head 66.<br>
Second process<br>
A release agent is applied on the mold 20, and the head 66 of the tensile core<br>
64 penetrate through the proximal end plate 30 and distal end tensile core 32, so that<br>
the head 66 of the tensile core 64 is caught to the fastening hole 36 of the proximal<br>
end tensile core fixing plate 34. The male threaded portion 680 of the tensile core<br>
64 penetrates through the female threaded hole 440 of the distal end plate 40, and is<br>
fastened using the tensile' nut 300. And then, the frame 60 prepared in the first<br>
process is seated on an opened mold 20.<br>
Third process<br>
The distal end plate 40 coupled to the distal end tensile plate 42 through the<br>
coupling ring 200 is lifted by rotating the tension shaft 50 using the tensioner, so that<br><br>
the length of the tensile core 64 extended to the bottom of the distal end plate 40 is<br>
stretched to a position corresponding to the length of the electric pole 10.<br>
At that time, the male threaded portion 680 of the tensile core 64 is fastened<br>
to the distal end plate 40 using the tensile nut 300 so as to maintain the fastening<br>
force upon the stretch of the tensile core 64.<br>
Fourth process<br>
The concrete is inputted into the mold 20, and the mold 20 is rotated in a<br>
state of a closed mold by a centrifuge to form a hollow of a thickness corresponding<br>
to that of the defined electric pole 10.<br>
Fifth process<br>
The concrete of the electric pole 10 is treated through the steam cure using a<br>
boiler to have a desired demold strength.<br>
Sixth process<br>
The tensile core 64 existed between the proximal end plate 30 and the<br>
proximal end tensile plate 32 is cut using a welding rod. After that, the coupling<br>
ring 200 is released, and the electric pole is demolded from the mold 20.<br>
Seventh process<br>
After tensile cores 64 protruded from the proximal end 12 is finely cut, and<br>
the distal end plate 40 is demolded by releasing the tensile nut 300. The fine cut of<br>
the tensile cores 64 protruded toward the proximal end 12 and distal end 14 and the<br>
natural cure are performed to complete the electric pole 10.<br>
In the second process, the tensile nut 300 consists of the long tensile nut 320<br>
and the short tensile nut 340, the long and short tensile nuts 320 and 340 being<br>
alternatively fastened. After the short tensile nut 340 is fastened, the long tensile<br>
nut 320 is fastened.<br>
In the seventh process, after the long tensile nut 320 is released, the short<br>
tensile nut 340 is released.<br>
Specifically, as means for stretching the tensile core 64, the distal end plate<br>
40 is coupled to the distal end tensile plate 42 connected to the tension shaft by use<br>
of the coupling ring 200, thereby allowing the tensile force to be applied. It is<br>
possible to penetrate one end of the tensile core 64 through the distal end plate 40,<br>
thereby shortening the cut length of the tensile core 64 relative to the conventional<br>
tensile core.<br>
In addition, one end of the tensile core 64 is fastened to the distal end plate<br>
40 by use of a bolting manner, so that the tensile core 64 may be stretched by the<br><br>
tensile force applied from the distal end plate 40. After the tensile core is cut in a<br>
length shorter than that of the electric pole 10, the tensile core 64 is stretched in a<br>
length corresponding to that of the electric pole 10, thereby allowing the cut length<br>
of the tensile core 64 to be shortened.<br>
Furthermore, in the process of fastening one end of the tensile core 64 to the<br>
distal end plate 40 by use of the bolting manner, the long and short tensile nuts 320<br>
and 340 are alternatively used to preclude the space in which a fastening tool such as<br>
the impact wrench can be accommodated. Therefore, the spacing between the<br>
tensile cores 64 is dense, so that the number of tensile cores 64 may be increased or<br>
decreased in accordance with the design value of the electric pole 10.<br>
The embodiments according to the above construction and process will now<br>
be described with reference to a below design table of the electric pole.<br>
Design table of electric pole<br><br>
The above design is the results of the test performed by employing the<br>
present invention, and embodiments will now be described with reference to Figs. 11<br>
and 12.<br>
Embodiment 1<br><br>
If a length of the electric pole 10 is 16 m, a design load of the electric pole is<br>
1400 kg, and a diameter of the distal end 14 is 220 mm, twelve tensile cores 64<br>
having a diameter of 15 mm are required. At that time, a spacing of the tensile<br>
cores 64 is 40.58 mm.<br>
One end of the tensile core 64 is fastened to the distal end plate 40 by use of<br>
the bolting manner. At that time, the long and short tensile nuts 320 and 340 are<br>
alternatively used to preclude the space in which a fastening tool such as the impact<br>
wrench can be accommodated.<br>
In addition, if the length of the electric pole is 16 m, the tensile core 64 can<br>
be cut to have the length of 250 to 300 mm shorter than that of the electric pole 10.<br>
The tensile core 64 is rigidly coupled to the distal end plate 40 through the bolting<br>
manner, thereby providing the distal end plate 40 with the tensile force and thus<br>
stretching the tensile core 64 by the length of the electric pole 10.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
If a length of the electric pole 10 is 16 m, a design load of the electric pole is<br>
2000 kg, and a diameter of the distal end 14 is 260 mm, sixteen tensile cores 64<br>
having a diameter of 15 mm are required. At that time, a spacing of the tensile<br>
cores 64 is 35.34 mm.<br>
One end of the tensile core 64 is fastened to the distal end plate 40 by use of<br>
the bolting manner. At that time, the long and short tensile nuts 320 and 340 are<br>
alternatively used to preclude the space in which a fastening tool such as the impact<br>
wrench can be accommodated.<br>
In addition, if the length of the electric pole is 16 m, the tensile core 64 can<br>
be cut to have the length of 250 to 300 mm shorter than that of the electric pole 10.<br>
The tensile core 64 is rigidly coupled to the distal end plate 40 through the bolting<br>
manner, thereby providing the distal end plate 40 with the tensile force and thus<br>
stretching the tensile core 64 by the length of the electric pole 10.<br>
Meanwhile, although the tensile core 64 has on one end thereof the head 66<br>
and on the other end thereof a female threaded portion 68 in the tensile core 64 in the<br>
present embodiments, the present invention is not limited thereto. In other words,<br>
the head 66 may be formed both ends of the tensile core 64, and the distal end plate<br>
40 is formed with a female threaded hole such as that formed on the proximal end<br>
tensile core fixing plate 34.<br>
If the heads 66 formed on both ends of the tensile core 64 penetrate through<br>
and is fastened to the female threaded hole 36 formed in the proximal end tensile<br><br>
core fixing plate 34 and distal end plate 40, since the distal end plate 40 is applied<br>
with the tensile force, the tensile core 64 can be stretched tight. At that time, a<br>
length of the tensile core 64 protruded toward the distal end 14 is shorter than that of<br>
the conventional tensile core, so that unnecessary length of the tensile core 64 may<br>
be shortened.<br>
Although the embodiments of the present invention are applied to the electric<br>
pole consisting of reinforced concrete structure, the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto. The present invention may be applied to another reinforced concrete<br>
structure with a tensile core such as file or hume pipe arranged.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
With the construction described above, the distal end plate forming the distal<br>
end of the electric pole is applied with the tensile force. Accordingly, it is possible<br>
to penetrate one end of the tensile core through the distal end plate, thereby<br>
shortening the cut length of the tensile core relative to the conventional tensile core.<br>
In addition, the tensile core is fastened to the distal end plate by use of the<br>
bolting manner, so that the tensile core may be stretched by the tensile force applied<br>
from the distal end plate. After the tensile core is cut in a length shorter than that of<br>
the electric pole, the tensile core is stretched in a length corresponding to that of the<br>
electric pole, thereby allowing the cut length of the tensile core to be shortened.<br>
Furthermore, in the process of fastening one end of the tensile core to the<br>
distal end plate by use of the bolting manner, the long and short tensile nuts are<br>
alternatively used to preclude the space in which a fastening tool such as the impact<br>
wrench can be accommodated. Therefore, the spacing between the tensile cores is<br>
dense, so that the electric pole may be manufactured in accordance with the design<br>
value of the electric pole.<br>
The exposed space of the distal end through the distal end plate is eliminated,<br>
thereby preventing the shape of the distal end from being poor due to the moisture<br>
discharge.<br>
The forgoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed<br>
as limiting the present invention. The present teachings can be readily applied to<br>
other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to<br>
be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives,<br>
modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
