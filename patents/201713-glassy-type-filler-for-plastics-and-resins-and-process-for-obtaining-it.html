				<td>GLASSY-TYPE FILLER FOR PLASTICS AND RESIHS AND PROCESS FOR OBTAINING IT<br>
The subject of the invention is a filler of the 5  glassy type for plastics and resins and a process for obtaining it.<br>
As known, -wf illersjr are of great importance in<br>
the overall composition of articles and products based<br>
on resins, especially phenolic resins, and on plastics,<br>
10  especially  when  these  articles  and  products  are<br>
produced by a molding operation.<br>
Fillers  are  an  additive  material  which  is<br>
normally incorporated into the polymers and can fulfil,<br>
depending on the situation,  the function of simply<br>
15  filling  the  polymer  or  that  of  significantly<br>
reinforcing it.<br>
As  a  percentage  by weight,  the  amount  of fillers may even be very high,  for example 40%, and they can have a key influence on the physicochemical 20  characteristics of the articles produced.<br>
Among the various existing fillers, those of<br>
the glassy type are very important and very widely<br>
used, and one well-known type of glassy filler consists<br>
of  minute,  approximately  spherical,  glass  elements 25  hereafter called microspheres or granules, the maximum<br>
diameter of which is very small, for example, about one<br>
tenth or one hundredth of a millimeter.<br>
The polymers or -aftnatrices*7 which surround these<br>
glass microspheres or granules result in articles whose 30  abrasion  resistance,   impact  strength,   compressive<br>
strength and flexural strength are improved and which<br>
exhibit impermeability and enhanced acid and solvent<br>
resistance.<br>
Further advantages resulting from the use of 35  said glass microspheres or granules as fillers are the<br>
overall  improvement  in  the  electrical  and  thermal<br>
properties.<br>
The molding operations are markedly improved<br>
because of the reduction in the in-mold shrinkage and a<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
smoother  and  better  finished  molding  surface  is obtained.<br>
There is also as a result a cost reduction in proportion to the cost and amount  of microspheres 5  added.<br>
Unfortunately, these glass microspheres cannot be simply added to said materials or matrices made of plastic or phenolic resins.<br>
This is because they require to be pretreated 10 on the surface with substances, called ^sizing compositions^, which act as a binder between the glass and the matrices in order to guarantee perfect and lasting adhesion to the glass- Among sizing compositions recognized as .being the most effective are 15 those commonly called "fsilanes*. These particular sizing compositions consist of molecules having one part provided with affinity for the glass of the microspheres and another part capable of copolymerizing with the matrices.<br>
20 In practice, said microspheres or granules are basically made of glass coated with an appropriate-type sizing composition.<br>
The abovementioned known technique obviously has advantages and disadvantages. As already mentioned, 25 the advantages relate to the qualitative improvement to the end-products which contain said microspheres. The drawbacks stem from a certain difficulty in the production of said microspheres and from their cost.<br>
This is because they must have well-defined 30 dimensions. In particular, the glass particles which form them must have small dimensions, between one tenth and one hundredth of a millimeter. In order to produce such f&amp;EfJjrJ&amp;s*. ue^y expensive -systems- """£ equipment must be used.<br>
35	Furthermore^ th_e sji&amp;aexmmt ,aepli£a£ion of the<br>
sizing compositions introduces an additional pjuase -whircn adds to the production .phase of t.he gl as.s. .part, with a substantial cost increase.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
The high production cost and application cost of sizing compositions consequently mean an increase in the cost of the end-products and considerably reduce the use of the fillers described.<br>
5 in fact, it should not be forgotten that the<br>
fillers used in plastics are often regarded as a<br>
filling which makes it possible to reduce, in a simple<br>
and effective manner, the overall costs of the<br>
materials employed in the molding operations.<br>
10	Another disadvantage stems from the fact that,<br>
despite the use of sizing compositions, the bonding of the microspheres or qranules to the matrices is not always optimal. From this standpoint, it is certainly desirable to obtain better adhesion between the glass 15  and the polymer.<br>
The technical objective of the invention is therefore to substantially reduce the abovementioned disadvantages, particularly those associated with the cost and the process for manufacturing satu Utter o-20 spn'eres or granules, and with the bondability of these microspheres or granules to the matrices which surround<br>
rnem.<br>
This  objective  is  achieved  by means  of  a<br>
glassy-type filler fefr plastics and cesinnsv espec-ially<br>
25  phenolic resins,  of ths type including granules of<br>
glassy material  which  are  provided  with  a  sizing.<br>
Composition,  characterized  in  that  each.  ,of.  sai-d<br>
granules  comprises  a  multiplicity  of  fraaments  o.f<br>
glassy material agglomerated together by said sizing<br>
30  composition.<br>
According to advantageous characteristics:<br>
o	said sizing composition comprises a compound chosen<br>
from esters of alkylsilicic acids;<br>
o	said sizing  is an aminosilane,  in particular of<br>
35     formula NH2-~R'-Si (OR) 3, in which:<br>
- R' denotes an optionally substituted, saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbon chain advantageously  containing  from  1  to  20  carbon<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
atoms,  especially  from  2  to  8  carbon  atoms, preferably an alkylene chain; - R denotes an alkyl group, preferably having from 1<br>
to 5 carbon atoms.<br>
5  One   particularly   preferred   silane   is   amino-propyltriethoxysilane NH2(CH2)3Si (OC2H5)3;<br>
o	said granules have a maximum mean size of between<br>
twenty and sixty micrometers and comprise at least<br>
two of said fragments;<br>
10  o said  fragments have on  average  a maximum  linear dimension of between five and fifteen micrometers;<br>
o	said fragments are made of glass, especially "E"-type<br>
glass;<br>
o	said fragments are made of milled glass;<br>
15  o said fragments are portions of glass yarns;<br>
o	the   amount   of   said   sizing   composition   is<br>
substantially  between  five  and  fifty  parts  per<br>
thousand parts, especially between five and twenty-<br>
five parts per thousand parts, by weight of the dry<br>
20     glassy material;<br>
o	the sizing composition furthermore contains a mineral<br>
binder, such as a clay or a mixture of clays.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for obtaining this filler,  characterized in that it<br>
25 comprises: a milling step in which the glassy material is reduced to fragments; a metering step in which a mixture including said fragments and a sizing composition is formed; and an agglomeration step in which said mixture of fragments and sizing composition<br>
30 is dried so as to form compact granules each including a multiplicity of said fragments and of the portions of said dried sizing composition.<br>
According to advantageous characteristics:<br>
o	said milling step is preceded by a selection step in<br>
35     which glass yarns coming from production waste and<br>
scrap are chosen for said milling step;<br>
o	said milling step is extended until fragments are<br>
obtained which  have  on  average  a  maximum  linear<br>
dimension of between five and fifteen micrometers;<br><br><br>
- 5 -<br>
o	during said milling step, water and a plasticizer<br>
and/or a mineral binder such as a clay, for example<br>
bentonite, are added to the glassy material;<br>
o	during said metering step, said fragments are mixed<br>
with a sizing chosen from esters of alkylsilicic<br>
acids, especially an aminosilane;<br>
o	during said metering step, said sizing composition is<br>
metered in an amount of between five and fifty parts<br>
per thousand parts by weight of dry glassy material;<br>
o	during  said  agglomeration  step,  said  mixture  of<br>
fragments  and  sizing  composition is heated to  a<br>
drying temperature of between one hundred and twenty-<br>
five and one hundred and forty-five degrees Celsius;<br>
o	said agglomeration step is carried out in a heated<br>
vessel and said mixture of fragments and sizing<br>
composition is injected into said vessel by means of<br>
compressed air so as to form granules having on<br>
average a maximum size of between twenty and sixty<br>
micrometers.<br>
We will now describe, by way of nonlimiting' example, a preferred embodiment of a glassy-type filler illustrated by the appended drawings in which:<br>
-	figure 1 shows, highly schematically and on a<br>
very  enlarged  scale*,  the  structure  of  a  granule<br>
constituting the filler according to the invention; and<br>
-	figure 2 shows the sequence of the main steps<br>
of  the process  for  manufacturing  the  granules  of<br>
figure 1.<br>
Referring to these figures, the filler according to the invention is indicated, overall and schematically, in its entirety by the reference number 1 within the context of figure 2.<br>
The filler 1 is generally of the type formed from particles which may be termed approximately spherical elements or microspheres or granules of very small diameter, consisting here of glass provided with a sizing composition. These granules are intended to be embedded in plastics and phenolic resins in order to<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
improve the many characteristics thereof, as indicated above.<br>
In particular, as may be seen in figure 1, the filler 1 advantageously consists of granules 2 whose 5  structure is of the composite type.<br>
This is because each granule 2 essentially consists of a multiplicity of glass fragments 3 agglomerated together by means of a sizing composition 4 which comprises a sizing preferably chosen from 10 particular silanes, the great effectiveness of which has been demonstrated experimentally: alkoxysilanes or esters of alkylsilicic acids.<br>
Among esters of alkylsilicic acids, an amino-<br>
silane NH2-R'-Si(OR)3 is preferred in which R' denotes<br>
15  an  alkyl  group  and  R  an  organic  group,  and more<br>
particularly  the  aminosilane  of  formula  NH2-(CH2)-<br>
Si{OC2H5)3.<br>
The silane contained in the sizing composition 4 which joins together the fragments 3 is present in an 20  amount of approximately between five and twenty-five parts per thousand parts by weight of the dry glass.<br>
The granules 2 have, on average, a maximum size of between twenty and sixty micrometers and contain at least two fragments '3. The term "maximum size" of the 25 granules 2, which have a compact structure because of the tendency of the sizing composition to form drops, is understood to mean the maximum diameter taken in the most greatly developed direction of the granules.<br>
In   contrast,   the   fragments   3   have   a 30  particularly irregular profile and have, on average, a maximum linear dimension of between five and fifteen micrometers, and preferably equal to ten micrometers.<br>
Another aspect of the invention resides in the<br>
fact that the fragments 3 are made of milled glass. For<br>
35  example, without excluding other types of glass, they<br>
may be portions of &gt;6eE/-type glass yarns obtained by<br>
milling.<br>
As  known, jfeE*-type glass  is a glass having optimum strength properties and a high elastic modulus.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
together with a high melting point. It may be defined as a calcium aluminum borosilicate, characterized by a very low alkali metal content.<br>
Glass yarns of different diameters can be used, 5  by mixing them,  the diameters preferably being less than 10 micrometers.<br>
Overall, purely by way of an example given of a preferred composition of the milled glass, the filler 1 may have the following composition:<br>
10       -  aminosilane NH2 (CH2) sSi (OC2H5) 3:  1.95% by weight<br>
silica SiO2:	71.5% by weight<br>
sodium oxide Na2O:	13.43% by weight<br>
calcium carbonate CaO:         9.6% by weight<br>
magnesium oxide MgO:	3.23% by weight<br>
15       -  alumina A12O3:	0.39% by weight<br>
iron oxides FeO/Fe2O3:	0.2% by weight<br>
potassium oxide K2O:	0.1% by weight.<br>
The granules 2 thus produced have a minimal cost since they consist simply of milled glass and have 20  a rough structure suitable for guaranteeing maximum bonding  to  the  polymer  matrices,  without  however introducing excessive irregularities. This is because the  fragments  3  are  partly  coated  with  sizing composition 4 and are*' associated with other fragments 25  so as overall to define a compact shape.<br>
One advantageous characteristic of the granules<br>
2 is that, once they have been produced, they do not<br>
need to be  treated with a  sizing composition:  the<br>
latter   is   still  present   in  the  binder  which<br>
30  agglomerates the fragments 3.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel process for obtaining a glassy-type filler.<br>
The process is composed of several steps.  In<br>
the first place, there is a selection step, denoted by<br>
35  the reference number 5, in which the type of glass that<br>
has to undergo the successive operations is chosen.<br>
w / P<br>
For . example,  *rE#-type  glass  and  preferably<br>
glass yarns coming from production waste and scrap,<br>
such as those of the *$Borosil£ brand, consisting of wet<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
glass waste obtained during the operation of fiberizing wet filaments, indicated schematically by the reference number 5a, is chosen.<br>
Next,  the  chosen  glass  is  subjected  to  a 5  milling step 6 in which it is reduced to fragments.<br>
The milling is carried out for example in wet<br>
mills of the Allubit type, that is to say mills known<br>
for milling' ceramics  and comprising  rotating  rolls lined with Allubit or sintered alumina, inside which 10  there is a milling charge composed of Allubit spheres of various diameters.<br>
The glass yarn is introduced with water and bentonite into these mills, which are shown simply by two rolls labeled 6a.<br>
15	Bentonite  is  a  well-known  natural  mixture<br>
essentially consisting of clayey minerals and has the property of being a plasticizer in the wet state and a tackifier in the dry state.<br>
In the mills,  the milled mass  is  composed 20  approximately of one percent by weight of bentonite, the rest consisting of glass and water in equal parts.<br>
The bentonite and water facilitate the milling of the glass, the bentonite helping to keep the glass in suspension in th£' water. This milling is carried 25 out, for example, for twenty hours if ten tons of glass are milled, until glass fragments having on average a maximum linear dimension of between five and fifteen micrometers are obtained.<br>
Preferably,  this  dimension  is  approximately 30  equal to ten microns.<br>
After milling, the process continues with auxiliary steps such as filtration, de-ironing and storage in containers -<br>
If  the  milled  material  is  collected  in<br>
35  specialized containers,  it  is  important  to  keep it<br>
agitated and to take into account any loss of water in<br>
order to prevent it forming a relatively compact glassy<br>
mass difficult to process.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
Next, a metering step 7 is carried out, during<br>
which  a  mixture  is  produced  which  includes  the<br>
fragments 3 possibly carrying some of the bentonite and<br>
a  sizing compound preferably chosen  from esters of<br>
5  alkylsilicic acids, in particular an aminosilane. The<br>
amount of this sizing agent (silane)  is between five<br>
and twenty-five parts per thousand parts by weight of<br>
the dry glass. The combination formed by the bentonite<br>
present with the fragments and the silane constitutes<br>
10  the sizing composition for the fragments within the<br>
meaning of the present invention.<br>
If the glass is collected in a container, the metering is preferably carried out by removing from the container the defined amounts,  for example one cubic 15  meter, and simply adding said amounts of additives.<br>
The mixture is treated very carefully in order<br>
to prevent the components from separating, particularly<br>
by keeping them rapidly stirred, for example by blades<br>
rotating at between eighty and one hundred and sixty<br>
20  revolutions per minute.<br>
Next, an agglomeration step 8 is carried out during which said mixture of fragments and sizing composition is dried, preferably by spray drying, so as to form compact ^granules 2 each including a 25 multiplicity of fragments and of dried portions of the sizing composition.<br>
To  carry  out  this  step  8,  the  mixture  of<br>
fragments and sizing composition is heated to a drying<br>
temperature of between one hundred and twenty-five and<br>
30  one hundred and forty-five degrees Celsius, preferably<br>
one hundred and forty degrees Celsius.<br>
This temperature is obtained in a heated vessel<br>
into which the mixture is injected by compressed air,<br>
so as to form granules 2 having on average a maximum<br>
35  size  of  between  twenty  and  sixty  micrometers,  as<br>
already mentioned.<br>
In detail, provision is made, for example, for the mixture  to  be  sucked  up  and  then  injected by<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
compressed-air  sprayers  into a  drier provided  with methane burners.<br>
The preferred temperature of one hundred and forty degrees removes the residual water and, above 5 all, causes the reaction of the si lane of the sizing composition which, by solidifying, results in the agglomeration of the fragments 3 into granules 2 and also solidifies the bentonite residues which contribute to the agglomeration.<br>
10	The filler 1 thus produced,  indicated in the<br>
box showing the agglomeration step 8, may be conveyed to a packing step 9.<br>
In particular, it may be envisioned to pack the filler into bags 10 or to pack it into large sacks 11 15  of one thousand kilograms.<br>
The process thus allows the filler 1 to be<br>
produced in various steps which are not particularly<br>
complex and do not require complex and very expensive<br>
equipment.<br>
20	The invention has significant advantages.<br>
The original structure of the granules, formed from milled glass fragments agglomerated by the same sizing composition as that used to promote bonding between the glass and the plastic or the phenolic 25 resin, eliminates the final step of applying the sizing composition to the microspheres.<br>
Furthermore,  the  cost  of  the  granules  is<br>
reduced, both because of the raw materials used, which<br>
are mostly simple glass fragments, and because of the<br>
30  manufacturing   process   which   does   not   include<br>
preparation steps requiring large equipment.<br>
The granules produced are compact but rough and thus allow optimum bonding to the plastic without conferring excessive roughness on the latter.<br>
35	The invention described above in a preferred<br>
embodiment is capable of numerous modifications and variants, all falling within the field of the inventive concept. In particular, it is envisioned according to the invention for silane alone to be used to form the<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
sizing composition which agglomerates the fragments 3, the milling possibly being able to be assisted by a plasticizer which does not have a tackifying property in the dry state.<br>
Moreover,  further details may be replaced by equivalent elements.<br><br>

The  process  as  claimed  in  one  or more  of 25  claims 10 to 13, in which, during said metering step, said fragments are mixed with a siring chosen from esters   of   alkyls-iiicic '  'acids,   especially   an aminosilane.<br>
1*1.     The  process  as  claimed  in  one  or  more  of 30  claims 10 to' 14, in which, during said metering step, said sizing composition is metered in an amount of between five and fifty parts per thousand parts by weight of dry glassy material.<br>
15"- The process as claimed in one or more of 35 claims 10 to 15, in which, during said agglomeration step, said mixture of fragments and sizing compositi.cn is heated to a drying temperature of between one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and forty-five degrees Celsius.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
16. The process as claimed in one or more of claims 10 to 16, in which said agglomeration step is carried out in a heated vessel and in which said mixture of fragments and sizing composition is injected into said vessel by means of compressed air so as to form granules having on average a maximum size of between twenty and sixty micrometers.<br>
A filler (1) is envisioned which comprises glass-based granules (2) provided with a sizing composition, in which filler each of the granules (2) consists of a multiplicity of milled glass fragments (3) agglomerated together by the agency of a sizing composition (4) containing especially a compound chosen from esters of alkylsilicic acids, particularly an aminosilane. The process comprises a milling step (6) during which the glassy material is comminuted into fragments by this milling, a metering step (7) during which a mixture including the fragments (3) and the sizing composition (4) is formed and an agglomeration step (8) during which the mixture is dried so as to form granules each including a multiplicity of fragments {3} and dried parts of the sizing composition (4).</td>
