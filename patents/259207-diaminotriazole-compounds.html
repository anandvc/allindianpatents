DIAMINOTRIAZOLE COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of Janus kinases (JAK). The present invention also relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of Aurora-2 kinase, Flt3 kinase, GSK-3 kinase and KDR. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the compounds of the invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine kinases consisting of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a critical role in cytokine signaling. The downstream substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. JAK2 has also been implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, which include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome and systematic mast cell disease.<br>
[0003]       WO2004/046120 describes diaminotriazoles useful as inhibitors of protein kinases, including Flt3, FMS, c-Kit, PDGFR, JAK, AGC sub-family of protein kinases, CDK, GSK, Src, ROCK and/or Syk. However, there is a need to develop compounds that are more selective inhibitors of protein kinases, such as those that inhibit Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3. In particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are useful as inhibitors of JAK family kinases.<br><br>

In Scheme 7, the amine group is reacted under standard coupling conditions to provide an amine derivative. It should be understood that the depicted synthesis could be modified to also provide other amine derivatives. Furthermore, coupling conditions other than those depicted could be used. Such methods are well-known to skilled practitioners (see, e.g., Greene or Greene &amp; Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis; WO 01/81330). It should be understood that the conditions should typically be chosen to be compatible with (i.e., unreactive to) the remaining substituents (e.g., the -NR1R2).<br><br>

[0061]       The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[0062]      Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate., propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrabydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [0063]       Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[0064]       The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of<br><br>

[0065]       In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>

[0068]      Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0069]      The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
[0070]      Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a<br><br>

phannaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0071]      As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the invention are inhibitors of one or more of Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3. In certain preferred embodiments, these compounds are effective as inhibitors of JAK2 and JAK3. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation of one or more of the protein kinases, including Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3 kinases, is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When activation of the Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3 kinases is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as "Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 or JAK3-mediated disease" or disease symptom. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation or one or more protein kinase, including the Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3 kinases is implicated in the disease state. [0072]      The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of a protein kinase, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of, e.g., activated Aurora-2, Flt3, KDR, JAK2 and JAK3. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/enzyme, complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment<br><br>

[0082] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.<br>
