(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE DIHYDROXYPROPYLTRI (C1-C3<br>
ALKYL) AMMONIUM SALTS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns personal care compositions providing moisturization both in high and low relative humidity environments.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dry skin is a problem in varying degree to most humans. This condition is particularly evident in winter. Personal care products such as skin creams/lotions, shampoos/conditioners, toilette bars/shower gels and antiperspirant/deodorants are normally formulated with at least one material to address dry skin. Symptoms such as itching, flaking and a visually displeasing dermal appearance can all to some extent be modulated.<br>
There are three classes of materials employed against the problem. Occlusives such as petrolatum or silicone oils serve to inhibit loss of natural moisture. They form a barrier between the epidermis and the environment. Another approach is the use of keratolytic agents to enhance rate of dermal exfoliation. Alpha-hydroxy acids are the most common agents for achieving exfoliation.<br>
A third approach to dry skin is topical application of humectants. Hydroxylated monomeric and polymeric organic substances are generally used for this purpose. Glycerin known also as glycerol is one of the most effective humectants.<br><br>
There are several shortcomings in the performance of known humectants. Even the best such as glycerin requires to be formulated at relatively high levels to achieve good moisturization. Secondly, known humectants perform well in high relative humidity environments; however, hardly any of these substances provide effectiveness at low relative humidity (i.e. less than 20% moisture at 20°C) . Average indoor relative humidity during winter is approximately 13% in areas such as the north-east U.S. It is quite evident that a real need exists for an improved moisturization technology.<br>
A moisturizer known as Honeyquat 50 with INCI name of Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey has been reported to be a better humectant than glycerin (see the Arch/Brooks brochure titled "Cosmetic Ingredients &amp; Ideas®", Issue No. 2, August 2001). Honeyquat 50 is described as being derived from the reaction of pendent hydroxyl groups (on the disaccharide) of a "light" deodorized grade of honey with a chlorohydroxytrimethyl ammonium derivative. Although this substance has excellent humectancy, moisturization at low relative humidity still remains to be conquered.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention seeks to identify humectants which are operative not only at high but also low relative humidity, for application in personal care products.<br><br>
1<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A method for moisturizing skin is provided according tosclaim 1 appended herein.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Now it has been found that hydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl)ammonium salts are excellent moisturizers providing humectancy at both high and low relative humidity environments. These salts may be obtained in a variety of synthetic procedures, most particularly by hydrolysis of chlorohydroxypropyltri(Ci"-C3 alkyl} ammonium salts. A most preferred species is 1,2-dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, wherein the C1-C3 alkyl is a methyl group. Amounts of the salt may range from 0.1 to 30%, preferably from 0.5 to 20%, optimally from 1% to 12% by weight of the composition.<br>
Ordinarily the C1-C3 alkyl constituent on the quaternized ammonium (quat) group will be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or hydroxyethyl and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred is a triraethyl ammonium group known through INCI nomenclature as a "trimonium" group. Any anion can be used in the quat salt. The anion may be organic or inorganic with the proviso that the material is cosmetically acceptable. Typical inorganic anions are halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates and borates. Most preferred are the halides, especially chloride. Organic anionic<br><br>
counter ions include methosulfate, toluoyl sulfate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, gluconate, and benzenesulfonate.<br>
By the term personal care composition is meant any substance applied to a human body for improving appearance, cleansing, odor control or general aesthetics. Non-limiting examples of personal care compositions include leave-on skin lotions and creams, shower gels, toilet bars, antiperspirants, deodorants, dental products, shave creams, depilatories, lipsticks, foundations, mascara, sunless tanners and sunscreen lotions.<br>
Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of the carrier may range from 1 to 99.9%, preferably from 70 to 95%, optimally from 80 to 90% by weight of the coirpcsition. Among the useful carriers are water, emollients, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, thickeners and combinations thereof. The carrier.may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably the compositions are aqueous, especially water and oil emulsions of the W/O or O/W or triplex W/O/W variety. Water when present may be in amounts ranging from 5 to 95%, preferably from 20 to 70%, optimally from 35 to 60% by weight of the composition.<br>
Emollient materials may serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers. These may be in the form of silicone oils, natural or synthetic esters and hydrocarbons. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from 0.1 to 95%, preferably between 1 and 50% by weight of the composition.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and nonvolatile variety. The tent "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient<br><br>
temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic (cyclomethicone) or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms.<br>
Non-volatile silicone 'oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers. The essentially non-volatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from 5 x 10"6 to 0.1 m2/s at 25°C. Among the preferred non-volatile emollients useful in the present compositions are the polydimethyl siloxanes having viscosities from 1 x 10"s to 4 x 10"4 m2/s at 25°C.<br>
Another class of non-volatile silicones are emulsifying and non-emulsifying silicone elastomers. Representative of this category is dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer available as Dow Corning 9040, General Electric SFE 839, and Shin-Etsu KSG-18. Silicone waxes such as Silwax WS-L (dimethicone copolyol laurate) may also be useful.<br>
Among the ester emollients are:<br>
a)	Alkyl esters of saturated fatty acids having 10 to 24<br>
carbon atoms. Examples thereof include behenyl neopentanoate, isononyl isonanonoate, isopropyl myristate and octyl stearate.<br>
b)	Ether-esters such as fatty acid esters of ethoxylated<br>
saturated fatty alcohols.<br>
c)	Polyhydric alcohol esters such as ethylene glycol mono and<br>
di-fatty acid esters, diethylene glycol mono- and di-fatty<br>
acid esters, polyethylene glycol (200-6000) mono- and di-<br><br>
fatty acid esters, propylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters, polypropylene glycol 2000 monostearate, ethoxylated propylene glycol monostearate, glyceryl mono- and di-fatty acid esters, polyglycerol poly-fatty esters, ethoxylated glyceryl mono-stearate, 1,3-butylene glycol monostearate, 1,3-butylene glycol distearate, polyoxyethylene polyol fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid esters, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters are satisfactory. Particularly useful are pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane and neopentyl glycol esters of C1-C30 alcohols.<br>
d)	Wax esters such as beeswax, spermaceti wax and tribehenin wax.<br>
e)	Sugar ester of fatty acids such as sucrose polybehenate and sucrose polycottonseedate.<br>

The compositions of the present invention can also be, optionally, incorporated into an insoluble substrate for application to the skin such as in the form of a treated wipe.<br>
A wide variety of packaging can be employed to store and deliver the personal care compositions. Packaging is often dependent upon the type of personal care end-use. For instance, leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, hair conditioners and shower gels generally employ plastic containers with an opening at a dispensing end covered by a closure. Typical closures are screw-caps, non-aerosol pumps and flip-top hinged lids. Packaging for antiperspirants, deodorants and depilatories may involve a container with a roll-on ball on a dispensing end. Alternatively these types of personal care products may be delivered as a stick composition formulation in a container with a propel-repel mechanism where the stick moves on a platform towards a dispensing orifice. Metallic cans pressurized by a propellant and having a spray nozzle serve as packaging for antiperspirants, shave creams and other sprayable personal care products. Toilette bars may have packaging constituted by a cellulosic or plastic wrapper or within a cardboard box or even encompassed by a shrink wrap plastic film. All of the aforementioned are considered packaging within the context of the present invention.<br><br>
Another aspect of personal care products of this invention will be the inclusion of instructions attached to or otherwise associated with the packaging. The instructions indicate to a consumer topical use of the composition on skin,, hair or oral mucosae. Packaging itself will usually be printed with the instructions but sometimes a separate written insert within the package may serve to provide the instructions. Typical language includes phrases such as "apply a thin layer to the underarm", . . "apply regularly to hands", "cleanse skin" and "pump a small amount onto the palm of your hand".<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-- specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In -other words the listed steps, elenients or options need not be exhaustive. Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention. All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 11<br>
This Example provides the results of moisturization efficacy tests. These tests involved evaluation on Porcine epidermis utilized as a human skin model. Equipment and protocol are outlined below.<br>
An environmental microbalance {Model MB-300H, VTI Corp.., 2708 W 84th Street, Hialeah, FL 33016) was programmed to measure the change in weight of porcine skin as a function of relative humidity at a constant temperature and air flow. The porcine skin was evaluated before and after treatment with aqueous solutions of humectants to determine the adsorption and retention of moisture.<br>
Sample preparation was done as follows:<br>
1.	Epidermal sections of porcine skin were cut to approximately 4 cm x 1 cm.<br>
2.	The skin, was washed in a 10% detergent solution and dried in a dessicator to a constant weight. This represents the untreated material!<br>
3.	The skin was soaked in a 1% by weight aqueous solution of the test sample for 15 minutes, excess fluid was blotted off and the skin was dried to constant weight in a dessicator. This represents the treated material.<br>
Sequence of conditions for the microbalance was as follows:<br>
1.	30 minutes at 0% relative humidity (ensures that sample, is dry) .<br>
2.	90 minutes at 80% relative humidity {determines amount of water picked up).<br>
3.	90 minutes at 20% relative humidity (determines amount of water retained).<br><br>
The experiments were conducted as follows:<br>
1.	The weight of a piece of untreated skin was recorded continuously during the sequence.<br>
2.	The piece of untreated skin was treated with the test sample.<br>
3.	The weight of the treated piece of skin was recorded continuously during the sequence.<br>
4.	Data reduction consisted of calculating the percent weight change from the initial weight for the untreated and treated pieces of skin.<br>
5.	The reported data was the difference between each treated piece and its corresponding untreated piece. Results are recorded in Table XII.<br>
TABLE XII<br><br>
Sample*	From 0 through 80% Relative Humidity	From 0 to 80 to 20% Relative Humidity<br>
Dihydroxypropyl trimonium Chloride	2.20	3.50<br>
Honeyquat®	0.31	0.70<br>
Honey	0.24	0,02<br>
Quat® 188	0.21	0.10<br>
Glycerin	0.21	0.10<br>
* All samples tested at 1% active material in water solution. Data points represent the difference in weight of treated skin minus untreated skin.<br>
Evident from the results is that dihydroxypropyl trimonium chloride was not only effective for moisturizing at relatively high humidity but also exceptional at relatively low humidity. This contrasts with Quat® 188 (chlorohydroxypropyl trimonium chloride) which hardly showed any moisturization activity. These results were especially significant relative to glycerin which is normally used for moisturization purposes in cosmetic formulations.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
This example details the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (identified in Table XII as dihydroxypropyl trimonium chloride) . A 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask was charged with 16.7 ml (53 mmol) of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (employed as a 60% material in water known as Quat 188®). The flask was equipped with a dropping funnel and stirring bar. A solution of sodium hydroxide (55 ml, 55.0 mmol) was charged into the flask via the dropping funnel at a rate to maintain room temperature (-20°C) of the reaction. Once addition was complete, the solution was stirred under ambient conditions for about 12 hours, followed by heating at 50°C for two hours.<br>
The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The product was spotted onto a 2.5 by 7.6 cm silica gel plate alongside the starting material and eluted with butanol: acetic acid: water (4:2:2) for approximately 50 minutes. Visualization was executed with ninhydrin stain and scorching on a hotplate.<br>
The crude product solution was first acidified to pH of 7, and then concentrated to remove water. Ethanol (200 ml) was added to the crude product with stirring. Upon sitting, sodium chloride precipitated and was filtered off under vacuum. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum on a Rotavap®, followed by additional drying under high vacuum (0.05 mraHg). A cloudy gel was obtained -yielding the final product in 97% yield. TLC analysis indicated a major spot at Rf = 0.27.<br>
A 60 MHz proton NMR (D20 w/T3P) analysis was run on the final product.   The spectra confirmed the final product structure. Mass Spectrum analysis in positive ion mode revealed a bf of 134 (minus chlorine).<br><br>
We claim:<br><br>
1.	A personal care composition for moisturizing skin topically, said composition comprising 0.1 to 30% by weight of hydroxypropyltri(Ci-C3 alkyl) ammonium salt in a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br>
2.	A composition as claimed in claim in 1 wherein the salt is dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride.<br>
3.	A composition as claimed in claim in 1 wherein the salt is present in an amount from 1.5 to 12% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
