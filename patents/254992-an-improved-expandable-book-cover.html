				<td>AN IMPROVED EXPANDABLE BOOK COVER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a protective and an elastic jacket for books.<br>
The invention particularly relates to an improved expandable book cover or jacket<br>
made from four way expandable or stretchable knitted fabric to cover books of<br>
varying sizes within a reasonable range.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
The use of book covers has been known since many years. A variety of book covers<br>
have been devised for protecting and preserving books from dust and soil from<br>
deterioration. Most of the conventional book covers have utilized either paper, leather<br>
or cloth materials for protecting books from external dirt and moisture. While there<br>
may be some advantages of using leather or plastic based book covers such as ease of<br>
cleaning over time, such book covers are not only expensive, it has other<br>
disadvantages like it tends to crack at corners or in areas where heat seals have been<br>
formed, due to stress which may thus result in material fatigue besides wear and tear.<br>
On the other hand, paper and cloth based book covers are less expensive but tends to<br>
get dirty and starts sagging at the corners and edges over use and stresses.<br>
Another type of book cover is also known where said cover, is made of glossy printed<br>
material made of expensive paper cover and to make it attractive, often the prints are<br>
made with fanciful inscription including the name of the book, the author and also<br>
some times diagrams. A book lover would like to maintain this cover page which is<br>
why the book cover is being used for all types of books which varies in size and<br>
shape. Thus most of the existing book covers are not impervious to material fatigue<br>
and tend to wear out fast. Additionally, existing book covers / jackets made of paper,<br>
leather or cloth are not stretchable / flexible and are hence not adjustable to varying<br>
sizes of books. Thus, existing book covers suffer from an inherent limitation whereby<br>
they have to be custom made to a pre determined size of the book. Consequently,<br>
known book covers cannot be used for more than one size of books and more than<br>
once.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to mitigate the drawbacks of the<br>
conventional book covers.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to have a book cover which bears more<br>
strength and does not suffer from easy wear and tear.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a book cover which is<br>
made of four way stretchable or expandable material preferably such material as<br>
knitted fabric.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to avoid a book cover which is much less<br>
expensive compared to known long lasting book covers available.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The improved expandable and stretchable, preferably knitted book cover, according<br>
to the present invention, is a hexagonal shaped book cover stitched such that it has a<br>
middle saddle or spine area which consists of a cylindrical channel portion joining the<br>
front and back cover portions of the book, thus having two lateral apertures like<br>
pockets to accommodate the front and back covers of a book. The said book cover is<br>
made of four way expandable or stretchable materials such as synthetic materials like<br>
nylon, viscose, Lycra or spandex knitted fabric.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided an improved book cover<br>
which is less prone to material fatigue than the existing book covers /jackets<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a book cover which is<br>
made of four way stretchable or expandable material preferably such material as<br>
knitted fabric so as to cover closely and tightly fits on the book.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is to provide a four way expandable / flexible<br>
book cover with a capability of covering books of varying sizes within a reasonably<br>
specified range.<br>
Thus the present invention provides an improved expandable book cover which is<br>
devoid of all drawbacks of the conventional book covers.<br>
In another object of this invention is to provide a book cover which is cost-effective<br>
compared to known book covers, at the same time long lasting book covers and is<br>
economically significant.<br>
These and other objects and embodiments of the present invention will become<br>
apparent upon a further reading of the following description with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a known typical book cover / jacket made of paper / leather / cloth<br>
based materials.<br>
Figure 2 shows perspective view showing the improved four way expandable book<br>
cover according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a partial cross sectional view of the improved expandable book cover<br>
according to the present invention having alternative stitching showing two pockets<br>
like apertures to accommodate the front and back covers of the book.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, the conventional book cover<br>
ordinarily comprises a rectangular piece of paper or like material comprising<br>
essentially a pair of horizontal fold lines (10, 10A) and another pair of perpendicular<br>
fold lines (20, 20A) as shown in Figure 1 of the drawings. The said book cover is also<br>
provided with a middle perpendicular border line (30) the either end of which is cut or<br>
required to be folded inside at two ends (40, 40A). For a wearing of the book (not<br>
shown), the cover is manually folded at the horizontal fold lines (10, 10A) and<br>
perpendicular fold lines (20, 20A). It is also necessary that the central fold line (30) is<br>
cut at the two ends thereof (40, 40A) in a manner as shown to accommodate the book<br>
so that the fold lines can be suitably folded to cover the book. Further to make the<br>
cover compact external material like adhesive or gum tape is generally used. It must<br>
be appreciated that once such book cover made of paper as illustrated in Figure 1 is<br>
used, it can not be reused for another book, some or particularly of different size or<br>
thickness without tearing the book cover. Therefore, it becomes imperative to change<br>
the book cover completely when it becomes necessary and such is not a reusable book<br>
cover.<br>
The present invention unlike the conventional book cover has a predetermined shape<br>
and configuration as illustrated in Figure 2. The expanded view of the new book cover<br>
comprises a hexagonal shape having four inclined edges namely (10, 15, 20 and 25)<br>
and two flat edges (30 and 35). The new book cover has multiple stitching along its<br>
two axes X and Y. Along the X axis; there is a rectangular stitching along the lines<br>
(40,40') and (50, 50'). The inner rectangular (60) is further stitched at points (61) and<br>
(63). The hexagonal main body is provided with a cut along the Y axis at its centre in<br>
a substantially 'U' shaped manner (40, 40'). The main body before stitching gets four<br>
folds along four lines connecting points (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64) and (64, 61). The<br>
hexagonal main body is provided with stitching between the lines (61, 65), (62, 65),<br>
(63, 65') and (64, 65'). The inner rectangular portion of the book cover is further<br>
stitched between the points (65, 66) and (65' and 66'). After this hexagonal book<br>
cover undergoes three-step operation, namely, cutting, folding and stitching in<br>
sequence, it can accommodate a book through its central hole marked (70) and lateral<br>
pocket like two apertures. The top and the bottom covers of a book can be<br>
conveniently inserted through the hole (70) as marked in the Figure 2.<br>
The book cover as described herein above with reference to the drawings can be<br>
modified even by stitching between the points (61, 66) and (62, 66) instead of a<br>
straight line by a curved line. Similarly the straight line stitching between (64, 66')<br>
and (63, 63') can be modified or changed to curved line stitching to hold the book<br>
cover in its shape so that the inner pocket (50) can accommodate a book conveniently.<br>
Since the material of book cover is made of four way expandable / stretchable fabrics,<br>
books of different sizes can be conveniently and tightly covered without altering the<br>
stitching or cutting of the new book cover.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, the book cover of present invention is preferably made of<br>
four way expandable or stretchable knitted fabric. This fabric can be made of<br>
synthetic material like nylon, viscose, Lycra and spandex etc. Use of an expandable<br>
material offers a few distinct advantages over existing book covers. Firstly, the<br>
elasticity of the material ensures that the book cover is retained tightly and uniformly<br>
over the book. Secondly, the elasticity of the material allows the book cover to be<br>
used on books of varying sizes within a substantially wide range and thus one book<br>
cover can be re-used on different books of reasonably varying sizes. Thirdly, if the<br>
improved and expandable book cover is made of synthetic materials such as nylon,<br>
viscose, Lycra or spandex then the said material, being water resistant, offers a higher<br>
degree of protection than ordinary paper / leather / cloth based materials<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the stretchable / flexible material is stitched with elastic<br>
threads such that when the fabric stretches tightly over to cover the book, the seams<br>
stretch with the fabric and wear and tear of the seams is reduced.<br>
While other advantages may be intrinsic to the cloth book cover and method as herein<br>
disclosed, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the sole<br>
embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the<br>
scope of the claims of the invention.<br>
