The invention relates to a spinning machine according to the preamble of the independent claim, in particular a ring spinning machine with a condensing device disposed between a drafting arrangement and a spinning device.<br>
Such arrangements are known for example from the publications of the patent applications with the numbers DE 19726694.0 and DE 19944444.7. The content of the said patent applications is to be regarded as an integral part of the present disclosure. Spinning machines of the kind mentioned above are included in the international patent classification D OlH-1/22,<br>
It has been noticed that during the operation of spinning machines with condensing devices in particular, it is important that a simple accessibility of the individual members is also ensured during the spinning operation. It is further an object of the present invention to provide individual parts for condensing devices which can be produced inexpensively and are easy to mount.<br>
The invention is now described below by reference to the enclosed drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows the view of a spinning place in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine, shown by way of an example of a ring spinning machine;<br>
Fig. 2 shows in a perspective representation the view of a part of a suction device, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a view of a suction housing with a part of a condensing element in the longitudinal direction of a spinning machine, with an adjacent nip roller.<br><br>
The material feed 7 according to fig. 1 consists in a conventional spinning machine either of a can or a roving bobbin. A sliver 71 (shown with the broken line) is supplied from the can to the drafting arrangement. In the case of a roving bobbin the roving is drawn off from the circumference of the bobbin. The fibre structure, namely the roving or sliver, reaches the zone of a drafting arrangement 1 via a deflection apparatus. The drafting arrangement comprises several pairs of delivery rollers 11, preferably equipped in part with aprons. The sliver 71 is drafted only weakly between the first and second pair of delivery rollers 11a and 11b and strongly between the second and subsequent pair of rollers 31, 33. The draft ratio can exceed in total the value of 100.<br>
The drafted fibre structure is nipped between a nip roller 33 and a condensing element 31 and subsequently condensed on the condensing device 3. The fibre structure leaving the drafting arrangement 1 is provided with a width which decreases during the condensing. A guide means 39, preferably in the form of a screen, can accompany the sliver on the surface of the condensing element 31 along the condensing zone 31*. Finally, a blocking roller 35 is disposed in the condensing zone, which blocking roller is pressed against the condensing element 31 and thus limits the imparting of twist from a spinning device 5 against the direction of the material flow. A suction element 37 is disposed in the interior of the condensing element 31 which is connected to a suction device 4. The condensing element 31 is preferably a perforated rotating cylinder, whereas the suction element 37 is provided with a suction opening in the zone of the perforation.<br>
Thread guides 55, 55' are disposed between the drafting arrangement 1 and the spinning device 5, which thread guides, in the case of a ring spinning device, upwardly limit the balloon of thread 73 according to fig. 1. In the lower zone of the spinning device the thread 73 is wound up on a yarn package 75 by means of a traveller 53 on a ring which is fastened to a ring frame 51 as a result of the rotation of a spindle 59 with drive. The height of the yarn package is defined by the range of movement of a ring frame drive 57 which reciprocates the ring frame 51 upwardly and downwardly in the vertical direction according to fig. 1.<br><br>
The suction element is schematically shown in detail in figs. 2 and 3. It consists of a housing 37.1 which is used as a conduit which transfers to the suction device 4, by means of which the air sucked in is discharged. Guide means 44b, 44c are attached to a tongue 44a in the front part of the housing 37.1, which guide means are used to enable the holding of the inserts 37.2 and 37.3. The housing 37.1 with the attached guide means 44b and 44c could also be designed in such a way that it carries only one insert 37.2. In this case the guide means 44b is not implemented. The inserts 37.2 and<br>
37.3	are inserted into the housing 37.1 in that an insert 37.2, which is shown in fig. 2 in<br>
 the unmounted state, is lowered according to arrow a between the guide means 44b and 44c and is then displaced parallel to an axis A outwardly through the guide means<br>
44c in the direction of the arrow. Projections 49 on the side of the insert 37.2 which face<br>
 the housing 37.1 prevent that the insert 37.2 can be pushed so far through the guide<br>
   means 42 thiit no defined position is given any more. The projections 49 which rest<br>
laterally on the guide means 42 thus secure the position of the insert 37.2 relative to the<br>
    housing 37.1 in combination with the guide means 42 per se. The insert 37.3 can be  <br>
positioned in analogy thereto in that it is moved at first in the direction of arrow a against<br>
the tongue 44a until it rests on the same. Thereafter it is displaced to the right against<br>
the direction of the arrow b through the intermediate space between the guide means<br>
44b and the tongue until the projections (not shown) rest on the guide means 44b. After<br>
the introduction of the inserts 37.2 and 37.3, a lid 37.4, which is swivellable about an<br>
axis A on the housing 37.1, is moved downwardly according to arrow c until the lower<br>
side of said lid rests on the tongue 44a. The lid is open on a side which faces an insert<br>
37.2 or 37.3 in order to receive the air from the insert 37.2 or 37.3. The air sucked in by<br>
the suction device 4 by means of a fan (not shown) passes at first through a suction slot<br>
40 on the insert 37.1 or 41 on insert 37.3 into the interior of the respective insert, which<br>
occurs according to the direction of arrow d, in order to flow then according to the<br>
direction of arrow e, f into the interior of the lid 37.4 which is used as a conduit. The air<br>
flowing into the insert 37.2 leaves the same through the side opening 45 and flows<br>
through the lid or conduit 37.4 in order to then flow further according to the direction of<br>
arrow g through a third opening 48 into the housing 37.1. In the closed state of the lid<br>
37.4	the first opening 45 is in alignment with the insert 37.2 and the second opening 46<br><br>
with the conduit 37.4. Furthermore, the fourth opening 48 of housing 37.1 and a third opening 47 on the rear side of conduit 37.4 are in alignment when the lid 37.4 is closed. The suction element 37 which consists of the individual parts of the housing 37.1, insert 37.2 and optionally a further insert 37.3 and the lid 37.4 can be brought to the machine in its entirety or in individual parts and can be mounted there. It is also possible to exchange only the inserts 37.2 and 37.3 according to the material to be processed. The slots 40 and 41 in the inserts 37.2 and 37.3 can be provided with a different design concerning shape and width of slot depending on the fibre material on the spinning machine, so that when changing the spinning machine from one material to another the respective optimal slot shape can be chosen. Fig. 2 shows in the right-hand part the condensing element 31 at least in part with the broken line, which condensing element can be a cylindrical or non-cylindrical, solid or flexible cylinder or a narrow ribbon or a strip of fabric. A perforation is provided in the condensing element 31 at least in the part of the condensing element 31 which is disposed above the suction slot 40, 41 in order to allow the passage of air into the suction slot and to apply the same to the fibre structure 71 guided over the condensing element 31 in the zone of slot 41 according to fig. 1. It is understood a respectively designed further condensing element 31 (not shown) is also disposed above the other insert 37.2 in the mounted state of housing 37.2. This is also shown in fig. 3 where only a part of a condensing element 31 is shown in alignment with the housing 37.1. If the condensing element 31, as is schematically shown in fig. 1, is arranged concentrically with a roller 11c and is torsionally rigidly connected with the same, it is appropriate if the housing 37.1 can rest on the roller 11c. The support can be made directly or by way of a spring 11d. The latter ensures a play-free contact of an insert 37.3 or 37.2 on the respectively associated condensing element 31. If the condensing element 31 is an apron or a narrow ribbon it doesn't have to be connected in a torsionally rigid manner with the roller 11c, which in this case is provided with a supporting function for the housing 37.1. In the zone of the insert 37.2 or 37.1 a blocking roller 35 can rest on the condensing element 31. This roller can also be used to drive the condensing element in the conveying direction of the sliver 71. By arranging the condensing element 31 or the condensing elements adjacent to the housing 37.1 it is possible to perform the mounting both of the housing 37.1 as well as the inserts 37.2<br><br>
and 37.3 during the operation of the spinning machine, i.e. while the condensing element is moved relative to the housing and the insert 37.1 and 37.2 and 37.3. In contrast to the representation of the insert 37.2 and 37.3 in fig. 2 in arc shape with mutually converging inner and outer contours, it is possible to provide an embodiment in which the inner and outer contours substantially lie on concentric circles. If the condensing element 31 is guided in the zone of the insert in one plane it is necessary that the side of the insert 37.2 with slot 40 is also provided with a plane arrangement so that the slot lies directly under the perforation of the condensing element.<br><br>
The co-pending application No.669/MAS/2001 relates to a spinning machine with a condensing device for condensing a fibre structure in a drafting arrangement which comprises a condensing element with a moved surface which is penetrated by breakthroughs, with the fibre structure being guided in the zone of the breakthroughs over the surface and air being sucked in through the breakthroughs into the interior of the condensing element, the breakthroughs are to be disposed transversally to the direction of guidance of the fibre structure in an oblong-hole-like manner.<br>
The co-pending application No.691/MAS/2001 relates to a spinning frame, in particular ring spinning frame, with a multiplicity of spinnint units, whereat each of said units has a drafting unit between a fibre supply and a spinning device and where on at least a plurality of those at least one suction pipe led, between the fibre supply and the spinning device, each of said suction pipe is being connected with at least one common suction channel that is connected to a sub-pressure source.<br>
The co-pending application No.716/MAS/2001 relates to a spinning machine with a condensing device for condensing a fiber structure over a defined condensing length in combination with a drafting arrangement, having a condensing element with a moved surface which is interspersed by breakthroughs, with the fiber structure being guided in the zone of the breakthroughs over the surface and the air being sucked through the breakthroughs into the interior of the condensing element and with the condensing element being associated especially with a nip roller and a blocking roller, a condensing length following downstream of the nip roller in particular is to be adjustable depending on the raw material of the fiber structure and/or a desired yam structure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
