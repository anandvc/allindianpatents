				<td>FILLING UNIT FOR FILLING THE CONTAINERS WITH PRODUCTS, IN PARTICULAR<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to automated packaging of small products into containers.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a unit for continuously feeding and counting such<br>
products, mainly pharmaceutical products, such as tablets, pills or capsules for pharmaceutical use,<br>
from now on called simply pharmaceutical tablets without losing the universality, and for<br>
subsequently introducing the pharmaceutical tablets into bottles or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the pharmaceutical production field, there are commonly known and used packaging<br>
machines for automatic packaging of pharmaceutical tablets supplied in bulk into bottles.<br>
Usually, a packaging machine of known type includes several working groups, among which,<br>
in particular, there are a device for orderly feeding and counting tablets, preferably performing a<br>
tablet quality check, and a device for filling the bottles, moving stepwise on a conveyor, with a<br>
predetermined number of tablets.<br>
There are several types of packaging machines for automatic packaging pharmaceutical<br>
tablets into bottles, types which differ mainly by the techniques used for orderly feeding and counting<br>
the tablets.<br><br>
A packaging machine belonging to a first type includes a<br>
feeding and counting device formed by a series of small<br>
bars arranged one beside another, crosswise with respect<br>
to the conveying direction and featuring a plurality of<br>
seats, each of which receives a single tablet.<br>
The above small, bars are carried along the conveying<br>
direction below a hopper, which contains a mass of<br>
tablets in bulk, so that each seat can receive a single<br>
tablet.<br>
The small bars are then moved toward a discharge station,<br>
where the tablets are released into the bottles, by the<br>
effect of gravity, making fall one or more tablets from<br>
one of the small bars into each bottle suitably arranged<br>
on the conveyor below the hopper.<br>
Thus, the number of seats of each small bar defines the<br>
maximum number of bottles, which can be filled<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The machines of the above described type reach<br>
considerable operation speed (even 300-400 bottles filled<br>
in a minute) , however they present many limits and<br>
drawbacks.<br>
First of all, the seats of the small bars are not always<br>
correctly filled during the passage below the hopper,<br>
because the tablets of irregular shape can be arranged in<br>
an incorrect position with respect to the relative seat,<br>
or some seats can be occupied by tablet fragments or by a<br>
non entire tablet.<br>
Therefore, it can quite easily happen that a bottle is<br>
filled in an incomplete, or incorrect way.<br>
Moreover, if a defective or partially damaged tablet is<br>
detected, the above described machines are not able to<br><br>
reject a single defective table and therefore it is<br>
necessary to reject the whole bottle containing the<br>
defective tablet, which obviously results in considerable<br>
economic consequences.<br>
Further drawbacks result from the complexity of the size<br>
change over operations in order to adapt the machine to<br>
operate with tablets and/or bottles of different sizes,<br>
since in order to work with each different type or size<br>
of tablets or capsules, it is necessary to substitute the<br>
whole group of the small bars.<br>
Another known type includes packaging machines featuring<br>
a plurality of rotating discs arranged one beside another<br>
along their axis.<br>
Each disc is driven into rotation independently from the<br>
others and features, along its circumference, a number of<br>
seats for receiving therein the tablets to be packaged.<br>
A hopper containing a mass of tablets in bulk is situated<br>
directly above the plurality of discs.<br>
During rotation, each disc withdraws single tablets, one<br>
by one, from the hopper.<br>
The disc rotation brings each tablet to an instability<br>
point, and consequently makes it fall into a bottle<br>
situated below.<br>
During this step, each tablet can be counted and its<br>
entireness can be checked by suitable check devices.<br>
Although, the above described packaging machines with<br>
discs are very fast and reliable at the tablets counting,<br>
they require the substitution of the whole group of discs<br>
each time the size and/or the shape of the tablets to be<br>
packaged is changed.<br><br>
This makes the use of this type of machines particularly-<br>
expensive if there are several sizes of the tablet to be<br>
packaged.<br>
A known packaging machine of a further type includes a<br>
plurality of vibrating planes arranged in succession<br>
along the conveying path of the tablets to be packaged.<br>
The tablets are continuously fed to the vibratinq planes<br>
from a hopper, and then they are gradually spaced apart<br>
and conveyed toward a counting area, at the outlet of the<br>
vibrating planes.<br>
The vibrating planes are usually equipped with<br>
longitudinal guides, arranged one beside another and<br>
containing each one a row of tablets: .<br>
Each tablet is counted at the outlet of the relative<br>
guide by photo-cell or capacitive sensors, generally<br>
during its fall into a channel conveying it toward the<br>
bottle to be filled.<br>
The number of longitudinal guides situated one beside<br>
another defines the number of bottles which can be filled<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The structure of this type of machine is usually simple<br>
and easy to maintain.<br>
Also the size change over operations; are rather simple.<br>
On the other hand, their production rate is rather<br>
limited and not always the spacing of the tablets in the<br>
area of the outlet of the vibrating planes is optimal.<br>
This results in considerable problems in tablets counting<br>
and checking of their entireness<br>
In a packaging machine of another known type, such e.g.<br>
the one described in the US Patent 5.463.839, the tablets<br><br>
to be packaged are. carried by a hopper on an inclined<br>
plane equipped with a series of channels, arranged side<br>
by side, each of which receives single tablets, one by<br>
one .<br>
The inclined plane moves the tablets toward a counting<br>
and packaging area.<br>
The above channels have undulated extension, and the<br>
undulation amplitude is gradually decreasing.<br>
Therefore, the tablets move faster and faster, coming<br>
close to the counting area and thus they are spaced<br>
apart, or singled out, so as to be counted during the<br>
descent into the bottles.<br>
Also the structure of the last packaging machine is very<br>
simple, but it presents considerable drawbacks, first of<br>
all in the spacing apart of elongated or oblong tablets,<br>
since the oblong tablets can easily stick or take a<br>
crosswise position in the undulated channels, thus<br>
causing the channels obstruction, which results in an<br>
incorrect feeding and consequently filling of bottles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a unit<br>
for feeding pharmaceutical tablets to bottles, which<br>
avoids the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
In particular, an object of the present invention is to<br>
propose a unit, which ensures a rapid and safe feeding of<br>
the tablets to be packaged to the counting area, keeping<br>
a simple structure, which is eassily accessible for<br>
maintenance operations.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
unit, which can efficiently move away and single out the<br><br>
tablets, in order to allow particularly reliable operations of tablets counting and entireness checking.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a. unit, which rejects single defective<br>
tablets.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a packaging machine, which is<br>
equipped with the above unit, and which operates easily with products of different sizes, thus<br>
requiring a reduced number of elements to be replaced during the size change over.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a filling unit for filling the containers with<br>
products, in particular pharmaceutical products, said unit comprising: a hopper for containing a mass<br>
of products in bulk ; conveying means for feeding said products coming out of said hopper along a<br>
predetermined path; a filling station, situated downstream of said conveying means for filling said<br>

BEST MODES OF CARRYING POT THE INVENTION<br><br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the reference<br>
indication M stands for a machine packaginq<br>
pharmaceutical tablets 1 into corresponding bottles 2.<br>
The tablets 1 are moved forward to a tilling station R on<br>
a carrier 4 by a feed screw C operated discontinuously.<br>
The reference numeral 10 0 indicates a unit for feeding<br>
and counting the tablets 1, which unit is an integral<br>
part of the packaging machine M.<br>
According to what has been shown in Figure 1, the unit<br>
100 includes a feeding hopper 3, containing a mass of<br>
tablets 1 in bulk and equipped with a lower mouth 3a,<br>
through which the tablets 1 exit due to gravity force.<br>
The lower mouth 3a is provided with a relative closing<br>
shutter 3b.<br>
In particular, according to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
hopper 3 is equipped with three outlet mouths 3a with<br>
relative shutters 3b, which move in such a way as to<br>
allow, when in use, to automatically adjust the outlet<br>
flow of the tablets 1, in order to regularly space them<br>
apart.<br>
According to what has been shown in Figures 1 and 2, the<br>
unit 100 includes a conveyor 5, which receives<br>
continuously the tablets 1 falling from the hopper 3 and<br>
arranges them substantially in parallel rows, so as to<br>
carry them to the filling station SR in a direction D<br>
defined crosswise with respect to the forward movement<br>
direction of the bottles 2 on the carrier conveyor 4.<br>
The conveyor 5 is supported by a structure, which has not<br>
been shown in Figure 1 and which is a part of the machine<br>
M.<br><br>
The structure includes preferably, but not only, three<br>
vibrating conveying planes 51, 52 and 53, driven to<br>
vibrate by vibrating means, known and not shown.<br>
The vibrating planes are arranged one after another and<br>
are slightly inclined downwards in the direction D.<br>
More precisely, the vibrating plane 51 situated upstream<br>
is arranged with its initial portion directly below the<br>
outlet mouth 3a of the hopper 3, the intermediate<br>
vibrating plane 52 is situated downstream of the plane<br>
51, and the vibrating plane 53 is situated downstream of<br>
the intermediate plane 52.<br>
As it is seen in Figure 1, the initial portion of the<br>
vibrating planes situated more downstream in the<br>
direction D lies below the terminal portion of the plane<br>
situated directly upstream, still in direction D.<br>
As seen in Figure 2, each vibrating plane 51, 52, 53 is<br>
equipped with a plurality of longitudinal guides 54,<br>
situated one beside another and parallel to one another.<br>
Each guide 54 is aimed at receiving and conveying, one by<br>
one, the tablets 1 in a single row, and presents lateral<br>
walls 54a, 54b converging toward the bottom of the guides<br>
54 (see Figure 4).<br>
Essentially, as it is possible to see in Figure 4, each<br>
guide 54 has preferably a substantially up-turned<br>
triangle cross-section, with the base open and. the vertex<br>
turned downwards.<br>
According to a not shown variant, the guides 54 have<br>
substantially U-section.<br>
This, together with the continuous vibration effect,<br>
allows to obtain a well determined arrangement of the<br>
tablets 1.<br><br>
In particular, in case of substantially discoid tablets<br>
(Figure 3a) , they tend to lean against a lateral wall<br>
54a, 54b, while in case of elongated or oblong tablets 1<br>
(Figure 3b) , they tend to assume a position with their<br>
main axis oriented longitudinally with respect to the<br>
relevant guide 54.<br>
The guides 54 of the subsequent vibrating planes 51, 52,<br>
S3 are aligned with respect to each other, so that each<br>
ot them can receive tablets 1 leaving the plane situated<br>
more upstream.<br>
The unit 100 includes also another conveyor 6, consisting<br>
of a rotating drum, which is situated directly<br>
downstream, in the direction D, of the conveyor 5 and<br>
extends along the whole crosswise extension of the<br>
conveyor 5.<br>
The rotating drum conveyor 6 is aimed at rotating<br>
continuously clockwise in direction W, with respect to<br>
Figure 1, with a determined angular speed, so as to feed<br>
the tablets 1 along a feeding path P up to the station<br>
SR, where the bottles 2 are filled. The curved section of<br>
the feeding path P is substantially defined by the edge<br>
of the drum 6.<br>
According to what is shown in Figures 2, 3a and 3b, the<br>
drum 6 is arranged with the upper part of its peripheral<br>
surface situated directly below the outlet portion of the<br>
fore vibrating plane 53.<br>
The cylindrical peripheral surface of the drum 6,<br>
according to the preferred embodiment shown in Figures 1,<br>
3a and 3b, is substantially smooth.<br>
Otherwise, like in the alternative embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 4, the whole peripheral surface of the drum 6<br>
features a plurality of grooves 64, each of which has<br><br>
lateral walls 64a, 64b converging toward the bottom ot<br>
the groove 64 and with a substantially up-turned triangle<br>
conformation, like the walls 53a, 53b of each guide 54 of<br>
the plane 53, in order to receive the tablets 1 released<br>
by the corresponding guide 54 .<br>
The drum 6 includes also holding means 65, which act to<br>
hold the tablets 1 on the surface of the drum 6, in<br>
particular within the grooves 64, according to the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 4.<br>
The holding means 65 include a plurality of channels 66,<br>
67, 68, situated inside the drum 6.<br>
The channels 66, 67, 68 (Figures 3a, 3b) are aimed at<br>
setting the surface of the drum 6 in communication with a<br>
vacuum source, known and not shown, which, creates an<br>
aspiration effect at the drum surface, so as to hold the<br>
tablets 1 by aspiration.<br>
In particular, the peripheral surface of the drum 6<br>
features a plurality of channels 66 (plurality of pairs<br>
of channels 66 in Figures 3a, 3b) , opening close to each<br>
other, so that even a small tablet 1 is anyway situated<br>
within the action range of the depression created by at<br>
least one of the channels 66, and is therefore held by<br>
the aspiration of the drum 6.<br>
According to what has been shown better in Figure 1, the<br>
curve section of the path P, covered by the tablets<br>
conveyed by the drum 6, extends passing through a<br>
checking station SC, where the unit. 10 0 includes checking<br>
means 7 aimed at acquiring information concerning the<br>
tablets 1 during their movement toward the station SR.<br>
This information relates in particular to the detection<br>
of the passage of each tablet 1 in a predetermined point,<br>
possibly also to the detection of some characteristics.<br><br>
such as shape, color or others, necessary to evaluate the<br>
integrity of the examined tablet and to perform a precise<br>
counting of the tablets 1 passing through the station SC<br>
along the path P.<br>
In order to perform the above detection in an efficient<br>
and optimal way, the checking means 7 include preferably<br>
a videocamera or telecamera 71, whose optical path is<br>
oriented toward the drum 6, so that it can see the whole<br>
extension of the drum 6.<br>
The videocamera 71 is also connected, in a wholly known<br>
way, to a processing device E, in order to send the<br>
latter the signals related to detections effected. Thus,<br>
the signals can be suitably processed.<br>
According to what has been shown in Figures 3a and 3b,<br>
the unit 100 includes also deflector means 8, which are<br>
situated near the drum 6, downstream of the check station<br>
SC and upstream of the filling station SR, and which<br>
detach the tablets 1 from the drum 6, so that the tablets<br>
fall into corresponding packaging channels 9.<br>
The deflector means 8 include a plurality of deflecting<br>
bars 81, situated one beside another.<br>
Each bar 81 is pivoted onto a pin 82 and is aimed at<br>
being moved by operating means, not shown, which are<br>
connected to the processing device E, alternately between<br>
a detach position A, in which the free end of the bar 81<br>
intercepts and detaches the tablets 1 conveyed by the<br>
drum 6, and tablets rejection position B (indicated with<br>
broken line in Figures 3a and 3b), in which the bar 81 is<br>
situated far from the drum 6 surface, so that the tablets<br>
1, found defective by the videocamera 71 and held on the<br>
drum 6, are moved forward to a subsequent rejection<br>
station, where the defective tablets 1 are detached from<br><br>
the drum 6 by a motionless deflecting panel 85 and fall<br>
into a rejection container 86.<br>
Each of the above mentioned packaging channels 9 includes<br>
an upper housing 91, whose outlet mouth communicates with<br>
an inlet mouth of a lower housing 92, which in turn, has<br>
an outlet mouth situated above a bottle 2 (Figure 1).<br>
According to what has been shown in Figures 3a, 3b, a<br>
bulkhead 93 is situated between the upper housing 91 and<br>
the lower housing 92.<br>
The bulkhead 93 is moved alternately by activating means,<br>
not shown and operated by the processing device E,<br>
between a position, in which the outlet mouth of the<br>
upper housing 91 is closed, and a position, in which the<br>
same outlet mouth is open.<br>
The operation of the unit 100 is; described in the<br>
following, beginning from an operation condition in which<br>
a mass of tablets 1 is present in bulk within the hopper<br>
3, and the bottles 2 to be filled have been brought on<br>
the transporting conveyor 4, by the feed screw C, to the<br>
filling station SR.<br>
The vibrating planes 51, 52, 53, are operated, that is<br>
the vibrating means are activated, and the drum 6 is<br>
driven into rotation in the direction W.<br>
Therefore, the vibration of the planes 51, 52, 53 creates<br>
a gradual forward movement of the tablets 1 along each<br>
guide 54 of the vibrating planes, toward and at the drum<br>
6.<br>
According to another, not shown, embodiment, each<br>
vibrating plane 51 is connected to two vibrating means,<br>
applied to the opposite lateral ends of the plane 51, in<br>
order to ensure that, the best uniform distribution of the<br><br>
tablets 1 can reach, through, other planes 52 and 53, the<br>
drum 6, thus preventing the drum. 6 from being not<br>
perfectly and not uniformly loaded with the tablets 1.<br>
When the tablets 1 are released by the guides 51, due to<br>
the conformation thereof, they are arranged in a well<br>
defined way; thus the tablets 1 fall and reach the<br>
peripheral surface of the drum 6 and are held by the<br>
suction present in the channels 66.<br>
In particular, the angular speed of the drum 6 is<br>
suitably and automatically adjusted, go that two tablets<br>
1 situated one after another, are spaced apart that is<br>
singled out) in best way.<br>
In the check station SC, each tablet 1 is perfectly<br>
detected by the telecamera 71, and then its integrity is<br>
verified.<br>
Each, tablet 1, if considered perfectly entire, is then<br>
intercepted by the, deflecting bar 81, situated in the<br>
detachment position A, due to the command of the<br>
processor E, which has received a suitable signal from<br>
the videocamera 71 .<br>
Afterwards, the intercepted tablet 1 is conveyed toward<br>
the corresponding packaging channel 9.<br>
In operation, if a bottle 2 being filled is present under<br>
the channel 9, the bulkhead 93 is kept open due to the<br>
command of the processor E, in function to the<br>
information of the telecamera 71, and the tablet<br>
lproceeds toward the bottle 2, taking place thereinside.<br>
Otherwise, if there is no bottle 2, because the feed<br>
screw C is bringing a subsequent group of empty bottles<br>
to the station SR and on the conveyor 4, the bulkhead 93<br>
is close, still due to the command of the processor E,<br><br>
which has received a suitable signal from the telecamera<br>
71, and the tablets 1 are accumulated in the upper<br>
housing 91 until a new bottle 2 is available.<br>
When this occurs, the bulkhead 93 is open again to allow<br>
the tablets 1 present: in the housing 91 to go down.<br>
When the counting of the tablets 1 by the telecamera 71<br>
reaches a predetermined and memorized value, that is when<br>
the bottle 2 is considered filled with tablets 1, the<br>
bulkhead 93 is closed again, still due to the command of<br>
the processor E, which has received an information signal<br>
from the telecamera 71, concerning the full bottle 2.<br>
If the telecamera 71 considers a tablet 1 defective;<br>
and/or not entire or anyway, faulty (indicated with<br>
broken line in Figures 3a and 3b) , the corresponding<br>
deflecting bar 81 is brought to the rejection position B,<br>
due to the command of the processor E, and thus the<br>
defective tablet 1 is conveyed by the drum 6 until it is<br>
intercepted by the motionless deflecting panel 85 and<br>
conveyed into the container 86 of tablets 1 to be<br>
rejected.<br>
One of the important advantages of the above described<br>
unit 100 for feeding and counting tablets 1 is chat it<br>
ensures a rapid and secure transport, without jamming of<br>
single tablets 1 to be packaged, toward the checking<br>
station SC and the subsequent filling station SR,<br>
maintaining a simple structure of the packaging machine<br>
M.<br>
Another advantage derives from an efficient spacing or<br>
separation of the adjacent tablets 1 in the check station<br>
SC due to the efficient presence of the sucked drum 6<br>
below the vibrating plane 53, which allows particularly<br>
rapid and efficient counting and optical check of<br><br>
entireness of the tablets 1 by the telecamera 71, without<br>
possibility of error.<br>
A further advantage of the unit 100 lies in the<br>
possibility to work with different sizes and dimensions<br>
of tablets 1, which consequently requires a reduced<br>
number of elements substitution and downtimes of the<br>
packaging machine M, of which the unit 100 is a part.<br>
Actually, the conformation of the guides 54, as well as<br>
the presence of the system for maintaining the drum 6<br>
surface in suction condition, allows to use the same<br>
elements for tablets 1 having even very different sizes<br>
and dimensions.<br>
Moreover, the unit 100 proposed by the present invention,<br>
due to the system of deflecting bars 81 operated to move<br>
by the processor E consequently to the signal of the<br>
telecamera. 71, allows rejection of single tablets 1<br>
considered defective, without the necessity to reject the<br>
whole bottles 2 because of the presence of only one<br>
faulty tablet 1, as it occurs in the currently used<br>
packaging machines.<br>
Moreover, the presence of the bulkhead 93 closing the<br>
channels 9 allows to continue the feeding, without<br>
interruptions;, of the tablets 1 even if there are no<br>
bottles 2 in the filling station SR, that is in the<br>
moments subsequent to the exit of a group 2 of full<br>
bottles from the station SR and before a new group of<br>
bottles 2 to be filled arrives.<br>
Therefore, the packaging machine M can work with very<br>
high working speed.<br><br>
