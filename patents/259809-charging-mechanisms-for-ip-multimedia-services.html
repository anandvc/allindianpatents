(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
“CHARGING MECHANISMS FOR IP MULTIMEDIA SERVICES"<br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (PUBL), a company duly organized and existing under the laws of Sweden of SE-164 83 Stockholm, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
2<br>
Charging Mechanisms for IP Multimedia Services<br>
Field of the Invention <br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to charging mechanisms for IP Multimedia services and which are applicable in particular, though not necessarily, to Push-to-talk over Cellular services.<br>
10    Background to the Invention<br>
IP Multimedia services provide a dynamic combination of voice, video, messaging, data, etc within the same session. By growing the numbers of basic applications and the media that it is possible to combine, the number of<br>
15	services offered to the end users win grow exponentially, and the 	inter-personal communication experience will be enriched. This will lead to a new generation of personalized, richer multimedia communication services.<br>
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is the technology defined by the Third <br>
20	Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to provide IP Multimedia services over 3G mobile communication networks. IMS provides key features to enrich the end-user person-to-person communication experience through the integration and interaction of services. IMS allows new rich person-to-person (client-to-client) as well as person-to-content (client-to--server) communications over an <br>
25	IP-based network. The IMS makes use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Service Delivery Protocol (SDP) to set up and control calls or sessions between user terminals (or user terminals and web servers). Figure 1 illustrates schematically how the IMS fits into the mobile network architecture.<br>
30 	Existing cellular telephone network operators have recently experienced tremendous growth in the numbers of subscribers choosing to use so-called "prepaid" subscriptions; that is where subscribers deposit an amount of cash (the credit balance) with their operators, which is consumed by tte subsequent<br><br>
3<br>
use of services by the subscribers. It is anticipated that the prepaid subscription option will prove equally popular with the users of IPMM services. Indeed, the provision of pre-paid services is likely to be a must for widespread take-up of IPMM services.<br><br>
When online/readme charging mechanisms are used (as for prepaid users), the general rule would be for the IPMM Serving Element (SE) providing access to the requested service, to request credit authorisation before granting a mobile node access to the requested service. However, this would inevitably <br>
10 	increase the session set-up time for prepaid subscribers, as the IPMM SE must conduct a credit authorization transaction with a Charging Control Node, also referred to as a Prepaid System (PPS) or Online Charging System (OCS).<br>
For some IPMM/IMS based services the session set-up time is critical. This <br>
15	applies for example to so-called Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) services such as 	Instant Personal Talk and Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk, where the originating party 	pushes the PoC button on his/her terminal to invite one or more users to a 	walkie-talkie type session, and expects to be immediately in contact with the 	invited party/parties (as opposed to the traditional call, ring, answer based <br>
20 	telephony services). The introduction of the prepaid payment mechanism as 	currently proposed is likely to result in a degradation of the PoC session set-up time 	to an unacceptable level, or may lead to a sub-optimal user experience due to the 	additional delay produced by the credit authorisation phase.<br>
25    	Summary of the Invention<br>
	It is an object of the invention to obviate the effects of prepaid payment 	mechanisms on actual and perceived subscriber service levels.<br>
30    		According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of 	reserving credit for a mobile subscriber in respect of an IP Multimedia service,<br>
	the method comprising:<br>
following initial registration of  the subscriber to the IP Multimedia<br><br>
4<br>
service but prior to invocation of an IP Multimedia service,<br>
using the early session establishment procedure to reserve a credit<br>
amount at a charging control node and to notify an IP Multimedia Serving<br>
Element of the credit reservation,<br>
5	whereupon, at invocation of said IP Multimedia service, the IP<br>
Multimedia Serving Element is able to proceed immediately with the session connection.<br>
	It will be appreciated that the early session establishment procedure will <br>
10    	comprise an exchange of appropriate messages between the IP Multimedia 	Serving Element and the charging control node. The messages may satisfy the 	requirements of the DIAMETER protocol.<br>
The early session establishment procedure will also typicaly be used for service<br>
negotiation purposes (e.g. exchange of media address and codec types) between the subscriber's terminal (UE) and the IMS Server.<br>
The early session establishment procedure may be triggered automatically following registration of the subscriber to the IP multimedia service, or may be<br>
20    	triggered, for example, by the subscriber/end-user activating a particular IP Multimedia service at his/her terminal.<br>
The invention is applicable in particular, though not necessarily, to Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) IP Multimedia services. <br>
The method may comprise, at one of the IP Multimedia Serving element and the charging control node, estimating an amount of credit appropriate to the IP Multimedia service. Preferably, this estimate is carried out at the charging control node.<br>
30<br>
In the case of a prepaid subscriber, said changing control rote will be a prepaid system (PPS) server boated h the subscriber's home network.<br><br>
5<br><br><br>
Preferably, the method comprises, at invocation of the IP Multimedia service, performing a credit authorisation procedure between the IP Multimedia Service Element and the charging control node based upon the actual service that has been requested/invoked to establish a revised credit amount The estimated     <br>
credit amount Is replaced by the revised credit amount<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating an IP Multimedia Serving Element arranged to facilitate access to an IP Multimedia service by mobile subscribers, the method<br>
10    comprising:<br>
following initial registration of a subscriber to the IP multimedia service but prior to initiation of the IP multimedia session, initiating an early session establishment procedure with a charging control node to reserve a credit amount at the charging control node.<br>
15<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there b provided a method of operating a charging control node arranged to control subscriber access to IP Multimedia services, the method comprising:<br>
participating in an early session establishment procedure following<br>
20 	initial registration of a subscriber to the IP Multimedia service but prior to invocation of the IP multimedia service, the charging control node estimating an appropriate credit amount to be reserved for a future session.<br>

Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments of the Invention<br><br>
In an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session there can be a number of users that are subscribers of several different IMS operators. In any generally applicable charging procedure, each of the IMS operators should be able to charge their own subscribers independently, according to their own charging  policy. That is to say that different charging models may be applied in different networks for the same IMS session. Moreover, different charging models may be applied to different sets of subscribers for the same IPMM service/feature, within a given operator's network.<br>
15 According to 3GPPRSTS 32325 and TS 32.200 and ETFDCC(Internet draft "Diameter Credit control application), two scenarios for IMS online charging are<br>
1) "One-Time Event with Direct Debiting* scenario. "Immediate Event Charging^' modelin3GPP. "Credit Authorization with Direct Debiting" model in IETF DCC.<br>
20 2) "Session-based Credit Control" scenario. "Event Charging with Unit Reservation" model in 3GPP. "Credit Authorization with Money Reservation" model in IETF DCC.<br>
In both models the IPMM Serving Elements (IPMM SE), i.e. credit control dent, request credit authorization from the Online Charging System (OCS)Prepaid<br>
25 	System (PPS), i.e. the credit control server, prior to allowing any service to be delivered to the end user. The Session-based Credit Control scenario is considered to be more appropriate for most IPMM services, and it is the scenario considered here.<br>
30 	Session-based Credit Control is a process in which the PPS rates a request from, a IPMM SE, reserves a suitable amount of money from the user's account, and notifies the IPMM SE of the corresponding amount of credit resources Of course, "credit resource" may not imply actual monetary credit<br><br>
7<br>
may be granted in the form of units (e.g. data volume or time) to be metered. Upon reception of a successful credit authorisation answer with a certain amount of credit resources, the IPMM SE allows service delivery to the end user and starts monitoring the usage of the granted resources. When the credit <br>
resources granted to the end user have been consumed or the service has been successfully delivered or terminated, the IPMM SE reports back to the PPS the used amount, and the PPS deducts the used amount from the user's account (the PPS may perform rating and make a new credit reservation if the service delivery is continuing). This process includes first interrogation,<br>
10 	possible intermediate interrogations, and a final interrogation. Both IPMM SE and PPS are required to maintain credit control session state information.<br>
The upper diagram of Figure 2 illustrates a general online charging architecture for IPMM, whilst the lower diagram lustrates a simplified architecture for PoC.<br>
15 	The Online Charging System (OCS) Prepaid System (PPS) provides the charging control function for a real-time charging mechanism. The Prepaid System includes the Account Balance Manager and the User Accounts, the Rating Engine and the Tariff Information. The Rating Engine provides rating values for sessions/services or events not priced at source, i.e. for which<br>
20    serving elements do not have a price.   For online charging, the IPMM SEs<br>
which may provide charging input to the PPS, are the Serving-Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF), the Multimedia Resource Function Control (MRFC),<br>
and the Application Server (AS). For Push -to-talk over Cellular (PoC) the SE providing charging input to the PPS is the PoC Server (which embraces MRF<br>
25	 and AS functionality). The interlace between the IPMM SEs and the PPS is based on the Diameter Base Protocol (DBP) and the Diameter Credit Control Application (DCC) as is being defined by 3GPP in Release 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 3 shows the PoC Release 2 architecture, where the PoC functional 30    entities are drawn with solid lines. The following interfaces are shown in Figure 	3:<br>

Im: Group management server to PoC client <br>
5    	Ik: Group management server to PoC server 	to: 	OTAP server to PoC cBent<br>
The PoC architecture has two PoC Server functions, Controlling PoC Server function/logical entity and Participating PoC Server function/logical entity.   In<br>
10 	each PoC talk session there is only one Controiing PoC Server, whereas there can be one or more Participating PoC Server. The Controlling PoC Server handles the centralized tasks that should not be handled by more than one PoC Server in the PoC talk session. A PoC Server behaves as either a Controlling PoC Server or a Participating PoC Server, as selected on a per PoC talk<br>
15     session basis.<br>
A PoC Server realisation (Le. physical entity/node) may behave as both a Controlling PoC Server and a Participating PoC Server at the same time and for the same PoC talk session.  In the case of Instant Personal Talk and Ad-hoc<br>
20 	Instant Group TaHc, the PoC Server of the inviting user is the Controlling PoC Server. In case of Chat Group Talc and Instant Group Talk, the Controlling PoC Server is the PoC Server owning/hosting the group identity (the Global Group Identity). Further details of these PoC services are given in the Appendix below.<br>
25<br>
As has been outlined above, the conventional approach to credit reservation for PoC sessions is likely to result in significant session set-up delays. An alternative method of reserving credit for PoC delay sensitive services/features (Le. Instant Personal Talk and Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk) is proposed here<br>
30     which maintains all prepaid characteristics (i.e. operator credit control, end-user real-time spending control). This method makes use of the so-called "early session” establishment procedure to reverse credit for PoC features with <br>
session set-up time before fie end-user initiates a talk session, i.e before the<br><br>
9<br>
actual PoC feature is invoked. The early session establishment procedure is used for service negotiation purposes (e.g. communication of IP address/port number for RTP/RTCP, and codec types) between the UE and his/her home PoC Server. The early session may be established immediately following IMS<br>
registration or at any later point in time. The early session establishment procedure is defined in the PoC Release 2.0 architecture.<br>
At early session establishment, the PoC Sever performs credit-reservation towards the PPS (by sending a Diameter Accounting Request (ACR), with<br>
10 	Accounting-Record-Type = START), before continuing with the processing of the early session establishment request The PPS tentatively rates the service (at this stage it is unknown which PoC feature  be invoked by the user at a later time) and, if the user's credit balance is sufficient, the PPS reserves a suitable  amount of money from the  user's account and  returns the<br>
15 	corresponding amount of credit units to the PoC Sever fm a Diameter ACA message, with Accounting-Record-Type = START). Upon successful credit reservation, the PoC Server continues processing the early session establishment request This credit authorization phase is not particularly time sensitive, as the PoC feature has not yet been invoked.<br>
20<br>
In the event that the credit reservation is unsuccessful (e.g. the user's credit balance is exhausted), the PPS initiates the Immediate Service Termination procedure by returning a failure indication to the PoC Server (in a Diameter ACA message, with:<br>
25     Result-Code = DIAMETER_END_USER_SERV1CE_DENIED).<br>
The PoC Server returns a SIP error indication to the serving IMS Core. An error indication is returned to the UE and end-user.<br>
As already mentioned, when credit is reserved at early session establishment, 30 	the PoC Sever is not aware yet of which PoC feature will be invoked at a 	later time, or indeed whether the UE performing the early session 	establishment procedure will be used by tie origination (session-owner) or 	terminating (participant) end-user. Thus, at early session establishment the 	PoC Sever<br><br>
10<br>
may only provide limited input for rating to the Prepaid System. At session connection (i.e. the actual PoC feature invocation/set-up stage), the PoC Sever processes the service request immediately, by relying on the previously reserved credit The PoC Server is now able to provide precise input for rating <br>
to the PPS (in a Diameter ACR message, with Accounting-Record-Type = INTERIM). This credit authorization phase is again not particularly time sensitive because an estimated credit amount has been already reserved, reducing the risk to the service provider. The service invocation can be processed immediately, write in parallel a scowl credit<br>
out to refine the rating.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the signaling associated with the early session establishment procedure when used for advanced credit reservation with the Instant Personal Talk feature. This scenario provides for an early session establishment <br>
procedure at both sides. (NB. the signing flow does not show the originating and terminating IMS Core.) The various signaling steps are as follows:<br>
Network-A early session establishment<br>
20 1a. UE-A begins early session establishment (immediately after initial IMS registration or at some later point in time, e.g. when the user activates the Instant Talk service from the UE) by sending a SIP INVITE towards PoC Server A, via IMS Core A (i.e. UE sends SIP INVITE to IMS Core A). The IMS Core A<br>
returns a SIP 100 Trying" to UE A. The IMS Core A detects an originating 25     trigger and as a result sends the SIP INVITE to PoC Server A. The SIP INVITE<br>
includes:<br>
Request-URI user part set to pre-configured string "Ad-hoc Group Request(the string is configured in the UE)<br>
Accept-Contact including the feature tag M+g.poc.talkburt=TRUE<br>
30     To = URI user part set to pre-configured string "Ad-hocGroupRequest 	From = inviting user's Public User Identity <br>
	Message body with Content Type’ application’ containing an SDP offer 1<br><br>
11<br>
2a. PoC Server A checks that early session is supported. For the purpose of this scenario ft is assumed that early session is supported. PoC Server A may send a SIP 100 Trying to IMS Core A.<br>
5    Charging in Network-A. first interrogation<br>
3a. The Controlling PoC Server starts a credit-control session towards user-A's home Prepaid System A while continuing processing the received session setup request/SIP INVITE. The Prepaid System A is identified by the ECF address<br>
10    downloaded as part of user A profile from Home Subscriber System (HSS) to<br>
the S-CSCF in IMS Core A at IMS user A registration time and transferred in the SIP INVITE from the S-CSCF in IMS Core A to PoC Server A.<br>
4a. The Controlling PoC Server sends a Diameter ACR to Prepaid System A. IS    The Diameter ACR includes:<br>

5a. Prepaid System-A tentatively rates the service (it is unknown at this stage whether any future requested service will be Instant Personal Talk or Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk), based on the contents of the received Service-Parameter-<br>
20    Info, makes a credit-reservation from the end-user's account (that covers the anticipated cost of the service) and returns a Diameter ACA message to the PoC Server.   For the purpose of this scenario the user's credit balance is assumed to be sufficient The Diameter ACA includes: <br>

The Controlling PoC Server A starts monitoring the usage of the granted-20    service-units.<br>
Early session establishment proceeds<br>
6a. PoC Server A sends a SIP 202 Accepted to UE A via IMS Core A. The SIP<br>
25    202 Accepted includes:<br>
Contact, containing the transient ad-hoc group identifier generated by the<br>
Controlling PoC Server<br>
Message body with Content Type "application/sdp" containing an SDP Answer 1 <br>
30<br>
7a. UE A sends a SIP ACK to PoC Server A Via IMS Core A<br><br>
14<br>
In parallel to steps 1a through 7a in Network A, steps 1b though 7b take place in Network B (involving User B, UE B, IMS Core B, PoC Server B, Prepaid System B). <br><br>
Early session -connection<br>
After completion of the early session establishment procedure illustrated in Figure 4, the connection procedure is initiated by a subscriber (UE-A in this<br>
10	case). Figures 5 and 6 illustrates signalling associated with an Instant 	Personal Talk establishment (l.e. connection setup). Again, the skjnaJRng 	flow does not show the originating and terminating IMS Core. The 	signalling steps are as follows.<br>
15     	Connection set-up with early session<br>
1.	The end-user at UE A, subscriber of Network A, presses the PoC button to<br>
initiate an Instant Personal Talk session with end-user at UE B, subscriber of<br>
Network B.<br>
20<br>
2.	UE-A sends a SIP REFER to PoC Server A, via IMS Core A. The SIP<br>

30     It will be appreciated from the above discussion that the introduction of the prepaid feature (a must for wide market acceptance of certain PoC features) is done in such a way that the credit authorization phase dose not influence the PoC talk session setup time. The PMM Serving Element (e.g. PoC Server)<br><br>
22<br>
performs credit authorization towards the Prepaid System to reserve credit, at some time after initial IMS user registration as part of the "PoC early session procedure"; that is before the actual set-up time critical PoC service feature (i-e. Instant Personal talk, Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk) is invoked by the end-used. <br>
5	 When the end-user invokes the PoC service feature, the IPMM Serving Element can process the service request immediately by relying on the previously reserved credit; at the same time the IPMM Serving Element performing a second credit authorization to provide the Prepaid System with refined rating input (e.g. the actual PoC feature invoked, the role of the session originating <br>
10 	party). As result, the credit authorization phase does not influence the PoC talk session set-up time.<br>
It will be appreciated by the person of skin in the art that various modifications may be made to the above described embodiments without departing from the<br>
15    scope of the present invention.<br><br>
23<br>
Appendix<br>
Push-to-Talk over Cellular (PoC) is a "walky-4alky" type of service based on IMS technology. The PoC service includes the following features:<br>
 5<br>
Instant Personal Talk<br>
This is a (1-40-1) voice communication with another user, where the users talk one at a time. A user invites the other user to establish an Instant Personal Talk session. A participating user of the 1-to-1 Instant Personal Talk service<br>
10		 may add a new user or users to the session, thus establishing a 	1-to-N communication (he. Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk).<br>
Chat Group Talk<br>
This is a 1-to-N voice communication, where the users speak one at a time. A <br>
15 	user joins the group in order to participate h the chat group talk, Le. each participant joins the session individually. There are two types of chat groups:<br>
1.	An open chat group is a group that can be joined-in by any user<br>
2.	A restricted chat group is a group with member list; only the user who owns the group is able to add and remove group members; only the<br>
20	group members are able to join the chat group talk session<br>
A group has to be created and the members have to be defined before a Restricted Chat Group Talk can be established.  A group has to be created<br>
before an Open Chat Group Talk can be established.  A participant in an ongoing open or restricted chat group talk session may add/invite other users to <br>
25	    the session; if the group is restricted, a participant may invite only users 	who are members of the group.<br>
Instant Group Talk<br>
This is a 1-to-N voice communication, where the users speak one at a time. <br>
30	 One of the members of the group invites all other group members to the 	instant group talk session. A group has to be created and the members have 	to be defined before an instant Group Talc can be established A member of 	the group who has left the group or has initially rejected the invitation, may join/ <br><br>
join an ongoing instant group talk session. A participant to an ongoing instant group talk session may add/invite other members of the group to the session.<br>
Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk <br>
5 	This is a 1-to-N voice communication, where the users speak one at a time. A user invites selected users to an Ad-hoc Instant Group Talk session. A participant to an ongoing ad-hoc instant group talk session may add/invite other users to the session. A user who has left the group or has initially rejected the invitation, may join/re-join an ongoing ad-hoc instant group talk session.<br>
10<br>
Instant Personal Alert<br>
A user may alert another user. The alert express the user's wish to communicate and it is way to politely request the other user to cal back using for example the instant personal talk feature.  An instant personal alert may<br>
15     carry a text message.<br>
In addition, the following capabilities are used in association with the PoC features described above:<br>
20     Group and List Management<br>
This allows PoC end-users (and operators) to manage group, lists and other Information, as described below. The information is stored in the network in the Group and List Management Server (GLMS) logical entity, and managed via the UE-GLMS interface.<br>
25<br>
Contact lists<br>
These are used for storing contact entries (individuals and group) in the UE and the network. Such lists be used by the UE to address users and groups when initiating PoC communication. Contact lists apply to Instant Personal Talk and<br>
30    Ad-hoc instant Group Talk session types.<br>
Access (Accept/Reject) lists<br><br>
These are used to define access rules; that is who is allowed or not allowed to reach a specific user via PoC services (i.e. a called/invited user may use accept and reject lists to accept or reject incoming talk session requests from other<br>
users). Access lists apply to all talk session types, and are used by the PoC 5     Server. This is a called/terminating party feature.<br>
Group lists<br>
Group lists are used to define PoC specific groups, and apply to open/restricted<br>
Chat Group Talk and Instant Group Talk. Used by the PoC Server and the UE.<br>
10<br>
Do-not-Disturb (DnD)<br>
The called/invited user may use the "Do Not Disturb" feature the block all incoming talk session (expect Instant Personal Alert). DnD takes precedence over the Appose Lists. Used by the PoC Server. This is a called/monitoring<br>
IS     party feature.<br>
Answer Mode<br>
The called/invited user may select auto or manual answer modes, and are used by the PoC Server and the UE.   It is a called/terminating party feature. The <br>
20 	   PoC Server serving the invited user may use the answer mode to select the media mode (early or late media) for the session.<br>
Presence<br>
This feature is used to advise parties of the accessibility of other parties.<br><br>
