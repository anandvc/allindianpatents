				<td>The field of invention relates to the process for preparation of a chiral fiber material. The present invention describes the preparation of a chiral fiber material for use in electromagnetic wave attenuation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chiral materials are now well known and they display handed structure in the same way as our own left and right hand. Each frequency of linearly polarized light is rotated by a different amount during transmission through a chiral medium. This phenomenon is known as optical activity and is observed by measuring optical rotation. In 1895, Cotton showed that chiral media can transform a linearly polarized wave into an elliptically polarized wave. The well known phenomenon of optical rotation and dichroism is observed in certain molecules and macromolecules.<br>
Most naturally occurring molecules and polymers such as nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides are chiral and optically active. Both naturally occurring and synthetic chiral polymers have attracted the attention of polymer scientist because of their application in many fields of science and technology including chemistry, biology, pharmacy, medicine, environmental science and optoelectronics. The application of chiral polymers reported in the patent literature includes matrix for chiral chromatography and chiral inducer in regioselective catalyst, as a chiral stationary phase in enantiomeric separation, as active and passive optical element, non-linear optics and optical information storage as in the fabrication of optoelectronics devices and as polarizing coatings or as polarized lenses, for asymmetric synthesis etc. a chiral polymer selected from polyphosphazeness was used as an infrared radiation blocking material in a thermal insulation product. The present invention is for the synthesis of chiral fiber materials to be used for new application, i.e., for EM wave attenuation.<br>
Several studies have theoretically examined specular light reflection and refraction for chiral media. The possibility of controlling the propagation characteristics of EM waves by varying the chirality parameter has been predicted by several theoretical modeling of chiral composite. The chirality in a material not only affects the polarization of wave propagation but also affects reflection, transmission and attenuation characteristics as well.<br>
Earlier chiral properties were achieved by incorporating metal helices in a matrix medium and EM wave propagation studies were extensively carried out by researchers. Inherent demerits of such chiral materials are their physical realization for any specific application due to their weight, poor chemical resistance and integrity with the host materials. To overcome such problems coliled carbon fibers and carbon microcoils were subsequently synthesized and used for similar application. Further, carbon fibers are will known filler elements for EM wave absorption and scattering over a broadband frequency region. Now attempts have been made to synthesize chiral organic/polymer materials for this purpose. The added advantages of organic chiral material over conventional material are its structural integrity with the host matrix and high performance in terms of band width and ultra light weight features. Development of organic chiral materials in the form of fibers and their demonstration for EM wave attenuation have not been reported so far in patent literature and this is a real challenge today. Chiral material and its fiber of desired length have been prepared. The present invention is therefore first of its kind and is associated for synthesizing chiral fiber materials for EM wave attenuation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is preparation of a chiral fiber material to be used<br>
for high performance EM wave attenuation.<br>
Another object of this invention is to synthesis a chiral compound.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to obtain such chiral material in fiber form.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention the condensation reaction of a chiral amine compound and a saturated or ethylenically unsaturated acid chloride in appropriate ratio in the presence of a base compound or alkali has provided a chiral compound. To carry out such a reaction a three necked flask is required along with an ice bath and does not need any sophisticated reactor. The process is versatile and used for making chiral material. The byproduct, hydrochloric acid in the presence of a base compound or alkali is neutralized and washed out with water only. The next step is the formation of<br><br>
fiber of the chiral compound. It is obtained by recrystallization process for which only a beaker and a proper selection of solvents are required.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a chiral material is synthesized by the condensation reaction of an acid chloride with a chiral amine compound in an appropriate ratio in the presence of a base. The byproduct, which is hydrochloric acid, is neutralized by the base compound and thus the reaction is facilitated. Then the synthesized chiral compound is allowed for crystal growth in an appropriate solvent mixture at a temperature of-10 to 30°C for 16-48 hrs. Thus a long fiber like crystal of the chiral material is obtained, which is having 1-4 cm length and diameter 25-100µm respectively. The aspect ratio of the crystal fiber is 200-1600. The fiber like crystal of chiral material what we call as chiral fiber.<br>

According to the present invention, the process of the preparation of chiral material in fiber form comprises of the following steps.<br>
1. Synthesis Of Chiral Material<br>
A chiral material is synthesized by the condensation reaction of a saturated or unsaturated or aromatic acid chloride with a chiral amine compound in an appropriate ratio in the presence of alkali or a base compound. The chiral amine compound, is taken in a three necked flask along with an alcohol solvent and the base compound or alkali solution and the flask was kept in an ice bath. The appropriate quantity of acid chloride is then added dropwise through a dropping funnel fitted in the side arm of the flask during 45-120 min while stirring the reaction mixture. The reaction was then allowed to carry out for 12-30 hrs at 0.4°C. The reaction by product, hydrochloric acid is neutralized by the base compound or the alkali, which facilitates the reaction. The reaction mixture was then poured in a large excess of distilled water contained in a beaker. The precipitate was filtered and then washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove the byproducts. The chiral material is obtained as cream colored mass. It is then dried at 60°. The yield of chiral material is ~ 88-90%.<br>

1-nathphoyl chloride (purity:98%)<br>
2-nathphoyl chloride (purity:98%)<br>
The chiral amine compound is selected from the following:<br>

and the alkali or base compound used here is either NaOH (purity:97%), KOH (purity: 85%) solution 30-60% or triethyl amine (purity:99.7%).<br>
The organic solvent used for synthesizing chiral compound is either methanol (reagent ACS, 99.8%), ethanol (reagent), iso-propanol (anhydrous, 99.8%), and n-butanol (99%), sec-butanol(99%), chloroform (stabilized, 99%), or a mixture of two.<br>
2. Preparation of Chiral Fiber Material<br>
The chiral material synthesized above was crystallized from an appropriate solvent mixture till the crystals are formed. The temperature is kept between 4 to 30°C and time between 16 to 48 hrs. for crystallization. Initially, the synthesized chiral material is dissolved in the solvent mixture under slightly warm condition. Then it is allowed for crystallization keeping without disturbance. Thus a long fiber like colorless crystal of chiral material is obtained (FIG.l).<br>
