FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to modification of tissue behavior, for example using electric fields and for example using biochemical markers as feedback.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
While some proteins have a mainly structural role in cellular life, many proteins are biologically active. Living cells include many mechanisms by which the biological activity of a protein is modulated, including: modification of concentration of the protein or its substrates, modification of the concentration of materials that catalyzes protein activity, indirect modification of protein structure, such as by changing of pH or concentrations of materials that modify protein structure, and direct modification of protein spatial structure and/or charge distribution by attachment of cofactors such as a phosphate moiety (phosphorylation), glucose, ions, metal ions, heme groups or iron-sulfur complexes and coenzymes for example.<br>
The symptoms of many diseases include changes in protein activity, as indicated, for example, by phosphorylation (hyper- or hypo-). One example is cardiac heart failure, where, as the disease progresses the phosphorylation of some proteins goes down and others go up. Levels of various proteins also change.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to modifying the activity of protems or other biochemicals optionally in situ and/or in vivo, for example, by modifying protein phosphorylation, using electro-magnetic or electrostatic fields. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the activity of the protein that is modified is one or more of signaling, catalysis, material transport and/or charge transport. While the term phosphorylation is used in the specific sense, the embodiments described herein are intended to cover other attachment/detachment of protein cofactors. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electric field is applied directly or induced, for example, using induction coils, magnetic fields or by methods of charge transport in the tissue, such as changing of ionic concentration.<br>
Some embodiments of the invention are based on the surprising discovery by the inventors that an electric field can have an immediate effect on phosphorylation of proteins.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, modification of protein expression and/or mRNA expression are practiced, in addition to or instead of phosphorylation changes. In an<br><br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention, protein levels of at least two proteins are normalized by application of an electric field.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modification method is used as a therapy and/or in diagnosis, for example for a diseased heart and/or for other organs in the body.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modification of the protein activity is a relatively direct result of the method, rather than a side effect. This directness can be noticed, for example in the time scale of some embodiments of the invention, where a change in phosphorylation is noticeable within a few seconds or mmutes. Alternatively or additionally, the directness can be noticed in a lack of intermediates, for example as indicated by the change in phosphorylation taking place even in cell homogenate, or even in the presence of protein inhibitors.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, protein activity modification comprises changing the actual work done by proteins in the cell. Optionally, as noted herein, this work is modified without synthesis of new proteins, for example, by modification of phosphorylation and/or activation of pathways.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modification is evident without requiring the synthesis of new protein. For example, phosphorylation of existing proteins may be provided.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the mvention, modification of protein activity and/or phosphorylation comprises modifying a steady state average level of such phosphorylation. Optionally, this modification comprises periodically increasing the percentage of phosphorylated proteins. Alternatively or additionally, the modification is achieved by shifting a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. in some embodiments, the modification relates to a single heart beat.<br>
In an exemplary embodhnent of the invention, the modification is on the time scale of a single or small number of heart beats, or faster (e.g., 1 second or faster). Optionally, an effect of the modification is noticeable on a same time scale.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the affected proteins are proteins that act on a non-protein substrate, for example calcium channel proteins. Alternatively or additionally, the proteins are signaling proteins and/or act on other proteins and/or are acted on by other proteins. For example, the affected protein enhances the activity of various enzymes, which, in turn, regulate essential ion channels and pumps. One example is that phospholamban, when phosphorylated, can increase the activity of calcium ATPase also known as SERCA-2a.<br><br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to using phosphorylation as a target for therapy, especially a therapy where the therapy method can be controlled at a relatively fast rate. For example, phosphorylation of phospholamban leads to increased activity of calcium ATPase and/or increase of the affinity of calcium ATPase pump for calcium. This, in turn, leads to increased or enhanced uptake of calcium from the cell cytosol to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, changing phosphorylation will stabilize the cell biochemistry and prevent or undo decline in cell functionality. This may allow a general improvement in the patient to occur, for example, as natural feedback and healing processes can kick into action.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an indication of protein activity other than phosphorylation is used for example, either as feedback or to determine efficacy, for example, microbiological parameters such as SR calcium level or macro parameters such as cardiac output as a function of MVO2.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the target of therapy is achieving a relative phosphorylation level. Alternatively or additionally, the target is achieving an absolute phosphorylation level. Such a target may be a window, with the values of the window optionally being variable. In one example, the values are dependent on one or more of 1) the state of phosphorylation of the protein, 2) the availability of the protein itself, 3) the condition and viability of the organ, 4) stressful conditions imposed upon the organ as a result of daily activity and/or 5) resulting from variation in circadian rhythm.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the target of therapy is achieving an effect of change in phosphorylation, for example, a change of cellular function, caused for example, by rebalancing a previously upset balance between the activity of various proteins or setting a new set point of a new, less hazardous balance (e.g., for therapy of a condition where the balance is hazardous).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the target is achieving a certain value or profile of protein activity, for example, a certain calcium pumping rate or pumping profile (as dependent on concentration and/or cell stress), which value or profile is determined by the phosphorylated protein, alone or in conjunction with other associated protems or cellular mechanisms.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, when the phosphorylation is used as a target, the therapy is increased, decreased and/or otherwise modified based on its actual or<br><br>
expected effect on phosphorylation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, feedback is provided for the method by measuring phosphorylation directly or indirectly.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, phosphorylation is used as a negative or minimum target. For example, when it is not possible to achieve a desired effect on an entire heart, for example, due to power limits or side effect limits, a minimum phosphorylation target is set for various parts of the heart and the therapy is configured so that this minimum achievable target is achieved. In another example, it may be desirable to minimize the amount of phosphorylation, for example in the event that hyperphosphorylation leads to progressive worsening of disease. In this case, the pulse sequences applied may be optimized to minimize the global and/or regional expected or measured phosphorylation of a particular protein. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, phosphorylation modification in ischemic and nonischemic regions is different or otherwise dependent on the condition of underlying tissue. For example, ischemic regions being controlled to improve phosphorylation and non-ischemic regions are controlled to also increase contractility.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, phosphorylation is used as a single or as one of several parameters in optimization or selection of a pulse sequence.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, phosphorylation is used as a guide for electrification sequence parameters settings. In some cases it may not be practical to use phosphorylation as an indicator for feedback, however, general experiments (such as those described herein) may show that certain sequences have a certain effect on phosphorylation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, sequences that are defined for another effect, for example, contractility modulation, are modified to take into account the results of these experiments. In another example, a sequence that is shown to have a certain phosphorylation effect is used in an open or semi-open loop, rather than a closed loop. The phrase "semi-open loop" is used to mean that feedback and modification of the sequence is at a much slower rate than the application of the sequence, for example, once a week or once a month for a sequence applied once an hour or more often.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to kits and methods of use thereof In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a kit includes a means to analyze a tissue sample to determine some indication of its phosphorylation levels, protem expression levels, mRNA levels and/or other biochemical markers. Optionally, the kit includes 1, 4, 10, 20, 25 or more or intermediate numbers of biochemical marker detectors for markers as described herein and/or additional markers.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the type and/or seventy of the disease is classified using the expression results and/or response to treatment results for a plurality of genes/proteins, for example, 3, 5, 10, 20 or more. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a database is built up by storing typical results for different patients and detecting relationships between levels/responses that are associated with certain outcomes and/or pathologies. It is expected that with increase in the number of biochemical markers and/or treatments that such classifications can be detected.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the kit includes instructions for use, optionally including thresholds of expected values and/or changes in values expected over time. Optionally, the kit is useful for one or more of diagnosis, detecting treatment progress and/or classifying patients according to expected responsiveness.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the kit is included with suitable software which tracks values and/or provides results.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the kit is used while device implanting, to assess a suitable implantation area of electrodes in the heart for example, according to the response to acute stimulation indicated by the kit.<br>
Optionally, the kit is used by taking a tissue biopsy, for example, using a needle or a catheter and testing the levels of bio-chemicals in a biopsy sample.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the kit is used for active testing of a tissue sample. A tissue sample is extracted and optionally homogenized (e.g., using a separate device) and then an electric field or other treatment is applied to the sample. Depending on the response of the sample, a diagnosis, progress and/or classification is determined. Optionally, the kit is provided with a set of electrodes which can be selectively attached to an implantable device, to assess its effect on homogenate. Alternatively or additionally, a stand-alone electrification system is used. Optionally, this stand-alone system includes a controller adapted to apply multiple electrification schemes and optionally store the effect of each scheme. Optionally, the stand-alone device includes a sampling chamber for selecting a part of the tested sample and applying a test thereto, for example, determining instantaneous or near instantaneous phosphorylation.<br>
In another example, the kit is used to test pre-treatment levels of biochemicals, including, for example, phosphorylation level.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the kit is packaged as a separate entity, while in some cases, multiple kits may be used, which may be packaged as a set. Optionally, different kits  for different sets of biochemical markers are provided. Alternatively or<br><br>
additionally, the kits are provided, for example, as single or multiple one-time kits, with a cardiac controller, to be used as part of the implantation and/or electrode location searching process.<br>
Optionally, the kit is used during implantation, before implantation is finalized, to help decide if the device should be left in the body or not, depending on its acute efficacy, for example, on phosphorylation.<br>
Optionally, a kit is used to test treatment other than electrical treatments, for example, drug treatments or exercise treatments. Optionally, the kit is used by sampling a sample before and after the treatment or by applying a proposed treatment to the sample itself and seeing if the sample exhibits a positive effect.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to controlling tissue, for example soft tissue and/or non-cartilagous tissue and/or non-supporting tissue such as the heart, by directly affecting a balance point of phosphorylation or other biochemical activities therein.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical activity of a cell is considered as having a resetting effect on the cell. Applying a field at the time of activation of the cell may miss this reset period. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a field which modifies the cell balance is applied before/after resetting time, then, when the resetting is applied by cellular activation, the cell is at a new balance point. In some cases, multiple {set balance; reset} cycles are applied to achieve a desired change in a cell or population of cells. In some cases, rest periods between application are required, for example, to allow a cell to stabilize and/or find a new balance state absent external effects.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an electric field is applied which skews a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a protein. This skewing optionally includes a long term increase in phosphorylation, for example if the time constants of dephosphorylation are higher than those of dephosphorylation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the protein affected is phospholamban or an ion channel, for example a transmembrane calcium channel.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the effect is a short term effect, for example, by applying the field in a maimer which allows long term phosphorylation levels to recover and thus prevent a long term change in cellular behavior, while providing an acute effect. In a particular example, the field is applied for a short time and then stopped until (e.g., according to measurement or estimation) the phosphorylation levels received. Optionally, the field is applied for a short enough time that the total acute change is small, for example a few<br><br>
percent (e.g., 
Optionally, the field is applied often enough to cause a long term effect. Optionally, the frequency of application causes only a slow change in acute values, optionally causing no acute effects to be seen.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the applied field is modified to take into account the change in cellular behavior and/or change in phosphorylation.<br>
It is noted that a test field applied for testing tissue response may not be the same as the treatment field. In one example, the test field is stronger. In another example, the treatment field is modified based on the results of the test field.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is tipped to restore a correct balance. Alternatively or additionally, the balance is skewed to be abnormal, for example to drive a cellular homeostasis mechanism in a direction to correct a defect in cellular behavior and/or compensate for such behavior.<br>
Optionally, the applied electric field is a dual function field, for example, being used for pacing or preventing arrhythmia. Optionally, the applied field does not acutely (e.g., within 10 heart beats or fewer) increase contractility by more than 3%, or less.<br>
A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to non-immediate effects of therapy. A first type of non-immediate effect is an effect that lasts a considerable amount of time after the application of the therapy. This type of effect may allow relatively long non-therapy periods between therapy application times, while still providing useful treatment of a patient. A second type of non-immediate effect is an effect that lasts after therapy is stopped, for example, physical and/or biochemical remodeling of the heart or cells thereof A third type of non-immediate effect is an effect that only becomes noticeable after a time, for example, protein expression changes which are not associated with immediate (acute) hemodynamic changes.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relate to new therapeutic non-excitatory sequences for the heart. Optionally, these sequences have as an aim to improve phosphorylation, rather than only contractility and in some cases, without immediate improvement in contractility. Optionally, a phosphorylation improving sequence, while generally capable of contractility enhancement, is applied at too low a repetition rate and/or power to achieve a meaningful change in contractility. An example is calsequestrin that, when<br><br>
phosphorylated, increases the sequestration of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum but does not increase contractility.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the sequences are optimized to one or more of acute or longer term effects of one or more of phosphorylation, protein and/or mRNA levels.<br>
Acute effects have some potential benefits for use as feedback, including one or more of faster feedback so faster optimization and/or per patient optimization can more easily be achieved, relative steadiness of physiological condition during optimization and/or ability to control an ongoing process, such as titrating of therapeutic drugs particularly in i.v. type drugs or delivery of any drug and dose.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the optimization (including a semi-optimization) is on a per patient, per tissue (e.g., location in heart), per diagnosis and/or per patient classification group.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, as compared to contractility modifying signals, the sequences have a lower duty cycle and/or more quiet periods between sequences, designed such that a desired phosphorylation effect is achieved, even if a sufficient charge is not delivered each beat (or any beat) to cause significant increase in contractility. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the sequence is based on a delivery' of minimum signals that increase phosphorylation, at time intervals timed so that decay of phosphorylation between applications is smaller than or the same as the increase achieved by an application. Optionally, the delay between signals and/or signal length and/or other parameters vary over time to track a possibly varying effect of the signal on phosphorylation as phosphorylation changes.<br>
In some cases, a field which would otherwise reduce contractility (e.g., a hyperpolarizing field) is used.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a power saving sequence is defined, which, for example, is designed to maintain phosphorylation levels, even if a desired contractility enhancement is not directly achieved, by reducing pulse amplitude, frequency of application and/or other power-related parameters. In some cases, contractility is not a consequence of the phosphorylation normalization<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a minimum dosage sequence is defined, which achieves a desired phosphorylation effect, without necessarily achieving other immediate beneficial effects such as contractility enhancement effects. Long-term, the improvement in phosphorylation may also improve contractility. In an exemplary embodiment<br><br>
of the invention, a therapeutically effective sequence comprises applying a field to the heart less often than once in 5 minutes, once in 10 minutes, once in 30 minutes, once an hour, once a day and/or once a week. For some uses, a set of signals, for example, 10, 20 or 30 signals (each signal corresponding to one heart beat), may be applied at such intervals, with an optional inter-signal spacing.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a phosphorylation-effecting signal comprises applying signals at different times in the cardiac cycle, such as absolute or relative refractory periods and excitatory period. The signal may be synchronized to the heart as a whole or to local activity, for example. Optionally, the signal is excitatory in some times of application. Optionally, the signal, at some embodiments thereof, may be applied at any point in the cycle, or at least during 60%, 80% or more of the cycle.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the optimizing of the pulse sequence is based on selecting a pulse or pulse parameters which will have a desired effect on the patient, for example, phosphorylation, e.g., above 10% increase, 20%, 40%, 100%, 200%, 500%, 1000% or intermediate or larger percentage increases. In some cases, a decrease is desired, for example, a decrease of 20%, 40%, 70%, 90% or intermediate or greater percentage reductions. Not all such increases and/or decreases are available for all biochemicals.<br>
In an exemplar}' embodiment of the invention, a method of manufacturing is provided in which a pacemaker or another electrical field applying device is programmed to have a pulse known to have a desired biochemical effect, such as phosphorylation, optionally even if such pulse has a reduction in other effect.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to applying therapy, for example, electro-biochemical control therapy as described herein, by selecting a long term therapy effect (e.g., as described herein) and modifying the therapy to match the effect. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modifying comprises changing the daily duration of signals, modifying rest periods between signals and/or changing the applied signals. Optionally, the modifications are between patients and/or within a patient, for example, as therapy progresses. Optionally, secondary targets for optimization when modifying a therapy are total applied charge and existence of side effects (positive or negative). Other parameters as described herein may be varied as well.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more of the following targets is selected: ejection fraction elevation. Cardiac muscle dimensions (e.g., reduction), chamber volume (e.g., reduction), quality of life (e.g., as measured using various tests), peak 02<br><br>
consumption (e.g., increase), anaerobic threshold (e.g., improve), 6m walking distance, fluid retention , sleep apnea severity and/or episodes and/or exercise tolerance.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the patients selected for therapy are those not indicated for cardiac resynchronization therapy.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, patients selected have a normal QRS (not wide, no conduction problems) and/or no desynchrony.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, patients have a narrow QRS.<br>
Optionally, the patients are NYHFA class III-IV severity patients.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to controlling a heart taking into account differences between local and remote effects of a treatment such as electrical field application.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a local area is an area which is directly affected by the treatment, for example a tissue area lying between two electrodes that are electrified or an areas to which a pharmaceutical is provided, for example using a path or using local injection or usmg other methods known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the tissue in this area is used to detect immediate effects of the field, for example, change in phosphorylation and changes in contractility. Optionally, a sensor is provided at the local area for example, a sensor that measures local muscle function and/or biochemical behavior, which sensor generates an indication of the effect of the sequence. Optionally, a one time use sensor is used, for example an anti-body covered optical fiber. Optionally, several such sensors are provided.<br>
Alternatively or additionally to acute measurements within minutes or seconds, measurements on a scale of hours are made.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the remote area is in the same heart chamber or in a different heart chamber and serves to indicate general progress in the cardiac condition. Optionally, such general progress is detected by measuring changes in biochemical markers in such remote tissue.<br>
Optionally, a treatment aims to improve one or both of local and remote "effects.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, areas to treat are selected based on a desired local and/or remote effect. In one example, local (e.g., electrode application) areas are selected such that a general improvement in cardiac function and a subsequent remote effect may be expected. In another example, multiple local areas are selected so as to positively control the cellular behavior in those areas, for example simultaneously or in series.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, progress is measured by detecting a wave-like propagation of tissue improvement, starting at the sites of electrode application. Such sites may be selected to provide a desired such propagation of improvement over the heart.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, plugs are extracted whole from tissue. Alternatively, plugs are built up and treated before, during and/or after build-up. In one example, plugs are formed by settlmg tissue on a matrix.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, apparatus is provided for holding a plurality of tissue plugs (e.g., 3, 5, 10,20 or more) while an electric field is applied thereto, for example, the apparatus including a chamber with physiological fluid, the chamber optionally includmg supports for the plugs. Optionally, one or more plugs are sampled or tested to see an effect of eth field. Optionally, one or more electrodes are provide dm or adjacent the walls of said chamber.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, stimulation of scar tissue can cause it to regain mechanical activity, for example by stimulation and/or healing of dormant tissue therein.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, stimulation of a transplant is used to enhance its activity and/or prevent degradation due to removal and implant Optionally, the stimulation used does not cause significant mechanical activity, for example, being applied at long time intervals. Optionally, the signal is applied to cooled, non-contracting tissue. Possibly, phosphorylation of a particular protein can lead to activity that stimulates the release, for example of specific neurohormones and activation of essential proteins. Optionally, the application of the signal to a cooled or cardioplegic heart is used during cardiac and/or brain surgery to facilitate restarting of the heart after such surgery.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to detecting of changes in biochemical behavior in the heart<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, changes in ECG morphology which indicate changes in protein levels and/or phosphorylation, are detected. Optionally, the morphology is a single cell clamp measurement.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a catheter biopsy is used to extract tissue.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a tissue sample is extracted and tested by stimulation/treatment thereof outside the body. Optionally, the tissue is homogenized and/or separated into individual cells.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, biochemical state is determined by measuring reactivity to other biochemicals. For example, the responsiveness to beta blockers may be detected to change when certain proteins are phosphorylated.<br>
Optionally, antibody based tracers are used, for example, in conjunction with florescent dyes and/or radioactive materials.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, biochemical changes are detected by identifying macroscopic properties of the heart. In one example, changed protein expression is expected to increase conduction velocity or maximum contraction velocity. Optionally, these parameters are measured and used to detect and/or estimate a change due to protein expression. Optionally, a database calibratmg changes in macroscopic parameters with biochemical parameters, is provided. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, conduction velocity is measured or estimated from measured ECG signals, for example, measured using the device.<br><br>
Optionally, these changes are measured at a time that a field application device is not active, for example, not active for a period of a few minutes, hours or days.<br>
A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to complex therapy utilizing modification of tissue behavior. In one exemplary embodiment, electrical tissue biochemical behavior modification is used together with pharmaceutical provision to achieve a synergistic effect, for example, one therapy compensating for failing of the other therapy or two therapies acting to achieve a common goal. One example is beta-blocker therapy in which an initial reduction in cardiac output may be offset using an electrical therapy. After beta blocker therapy has a positive effect, electrical therapy may be used to provide a further increase in cardiac improvement. Optionally, a same pathway or mechanism is targeted using multiple therapies. In another exemplary embodiment, multiple pathways are treated, some with biochemical behavior modification using electrical means and some, optionally, with other means, such as pharmaceuticals. In another example, another therapy or application is used to modify the effect of electrical therapy, for example, applying or reducing stress before or during electrical therapy application. It should be noted that in some cases contractility change is minimal, absent or in the form of reduction.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to targeted therapy delivery and/or modulation of therapy. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a signal that modulates phosphorylation is applied, while the availability of a substrate relevant for phosphorylation is modified. In one example, a pharmaceutical which reduces or increases the phosphorylated protein is provided. In another example, the electric field is used to activate protems generated using gene therapy, such as DNA plasmid injection coding for SERCA-2a, whereby phosphorylation of phospholamban would enhance the activity of the SERCA-2a. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, targeting is achieved by therapy requiring the temporal and spatial intersection of the substrate/precursor and the signal which has the phosphorylation effect. Optionally, an area is drained of or filled with substrate, for example, by previous application of suitable signals, exercises and/or pharmaceuticals. For example, a cardiac region may be stressed to increase or reduce its susceptibility to the phosphorylation modifying signal.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is noted that the need of a substrate to be available for a protein to be phosphorylated allows selective achievement of the contractility modulation effect and the phosphorylation effect, for example by selectively applying the signal when there is no substrate and/or by selectively applying the signals often enough to achieve phosphorylation but not often enough for significant contractility enhancement.<br><br>
In an -exemplary embodiment of the invention, particular proteins are selectively affected by timing the lengths of signals applied so that they differentially affect one protein or another. Optionally, the signals are repeated in order to have a sufficient effect on a desired protein. Optionally, the signals are delayed from one another in order to allow changes in activity levels of a protein to decay. Optionally, selective mRNA expression is provided by selectively affecting proteins which cause mRNA changes.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, selective inhibitors are provided, for example, anti-sense DNA or protein inhibitors, to inhibit certain biochemical pathways. Alternatively or additionally, substrates or exciting materials are provided to enhance certain pathways.<br>
An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to selective control of different proteins, for example selective phosphorylation rates thereof. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an electric field is used to differentially affect more that one of phospholamban and calcium channels. Such differentiability is to be expected due to the difference in location in the cell of the two proteins (trans-membrane and intracellular) and due to the different mechanism for dephosphorylation, each of which generally has a different time rate. Thus, applying pulses of electricity at a certain amplitude and/or a certain rate may be expected to affect one protein more than the other. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates are optionally controlled by controlling availability of substrates and/or catalytic enzyme, for example, using suitable bio-chemicals applied to the cell or patient.<br>
It should be noted that multiple mechanisms for improving contractility generally exist in a cell. Each of the calcium channels and the phospholamban, affect contractility in a different manner and this may allow selecting what manner of affect is desired.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, contractility increase of a cell is blocked using one biochemical, while using phosphorylation control to improve cellular homeostasis. Optionally, such blocking is applied locally, for example to small parts of the heart where the overall cardiac output will not be too damaged. Optionally, anti-arrhythmic treatment (e.g., electrical or drug) is applied at a same time.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a local effect is applied to enhance local function of the heart, for example in viable regions of a ventricle after massive myocardial infarction. Alternatively or additionally, a local effect is applied to suppress the over contraction of a region of the heart as in patients with hyperdynamic septum as in asymmetrical septal hypertrophy.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, tissue viability (e.g., after infarct, donor organ) is tested using methods as described herein for examining activity.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more of the following mechanism are addressed using electrical therapy as described herein: affecting calcium availability (intra-or inter- beat time scale), affecting phosphorylation (intra- or inter- beat time scale, affecting mRNA expression directly or indirectly (e.g., by calcium availability and/or phosphorylation) and protein synthesis (days) which affects the cellular steady state. By suitable mixing of therapies or giving therapies with opposite effects at suitable timing, various results can be achieved, for example, long term improvement due to protein synthesis may be offset by momentary blocking of protein activity (e.g., with a pharmaceutical). Similarly, once protein synthesis is underway, a delay of a few days will not completely undo the effects of therapy. In a particular example, prior to starting with beta blockers, electrical therapy may be applied for a while and then, once synthesis has started, e.g., after a few days or a week or based on measurements, electrical therapy may be stopped or applied only every few days, while beta-blockers (or other pharmaceuticals) are applied.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Overview<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are based on the discovery that certain electrical signals have an immediate effect on the phosphorylation of certam cardiac proteins, for example, at least one, at least 2, at least 3 or at least 5 proteins. Optionally, a set of proteins is affected, for example protems that relate to calcium availability. In particular, an effect on proteins that control calcium pumping and others (all of which are known to change in heart failure), has been discovered. Selectively in which proteins were affected is also shown. Proteins not related to heart failure are apparently not affected. The effect has been found to work in a range of tissue organization levels starting from tissue homogenate, through isolated cells and even in in-vivo dog hearts. The effect remains (in dog hearts) for 15 minutes at least, and an initial effect is noticeable after as little as 1 minute or even a few seconds, such as 3-10 seconds, for tissue samples from a foci of signal application. Some proteins were phosphorylated and some were un-phosphorylated by the signal. Generally, the results show a diange in the phosphorylation values in a direction of "normal" levels, or their being maintained at normal values. Experiments using pacing signals have not shown this effect.<br><br>
This phosphorylation effect is optionally in addition to or instead of effects on mRNA expression and protein expression levels, which, in some embodiments of the invention are normalized, changed to more norma! values and/or changed in a manner which overcompensates for a deficit.<br>
In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention, this discovery is used in the design of methods and apparatus for treating tissue, especially cardiac tissue.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the terms "expression" and "regulation" should be construed in their broadest possible sense so that they include any factor which influences a biological activity. Thus expression and/or regulation include, but are not limited to factors such as control exercised at the genomic DNA level, the RNA level, the protein level and secretion level.<br>
With regard to genomic DNA, control may be exercised, for example, by altering a phosphorylation and/or a methylation state at one or more sites in a relevant genomic sequence.<br>
With regard to RNA, control may be exercised, for example, by regulating a rate of transcription of an mRNA transcript, and/or by altering a stability of an mRNA transcript, and/or by altering a relative amount of splice variants from a single mRNA transcript.<br>
With regard to protein, control may be exercised, for example, by regulating one or more cleavage events and/or addition of one or more side chains and/or protein stability. In some cases cleavage of a protein may increase a biological activity of the protein and/or facilitate secretion from a cell. In other cases, cleavage of a protein may reduce or eliminate activity of the protein. The term side chains, as used herein, denotes any molecular moiety which can be attached to an amino acid of the protein. In some cases, side chains are attached after translation. In other cases a tRNA molecule may attach an amino acid bearing a side chain during translation.<br>
With regard to secretion, control may be exercised, for example, by allowing or preventing of secretion of compounds, such as connective tissue dissolving enzymes and biochemical signaling molecules. Schematic device<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a tissue controller 100 utilizing an electrical field to achieve a phosphorylation effect, m accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, controller 100 comprises at least one electrode 102 adapted to apply an electric field to a tissue 104, for example a heart. A control circuitry 106 optionally controls the output of a power drive 108 which electrifies the at least one electrode 102. One or more optional physiological sensors 110 optionally provide feedback<br><br>
to be used by circuitry 106 m controlling tne eelectrification of the at least one electrode 102, for example, general feedback about the heart (e.g., EGG) and/or a micro-biological sensor, for example for mRNA expression profiles or protein activity level. Optionally, such sensors include fiber-optic anti-body based sensors, DNA or protein chips and/or lab-on-chip type sensors. General body sensors, such as a sensor 112 may be used as well, for example, to estimate fluid retention or motion of the patient (e.g., rest/exercise as estimated using an accelerator).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, controller 100 is in the form of a pacemaker or non-excitatory controller, for example as described in one or more of the following applications and publications.<br>
Exemplary protocols for the actual delivery of signals to the heart and/or implantation of wires to deliver CCM signals is set forth in PCT publication No. WO 97/25098 and U.S. Patent No. 6,317,631, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>

In some embodiments of the invention, the devices described in PCT publications WO 2005/056II1, WO 2005/102188 and/or WO 2005/105013, with suitable changes in programming, are used.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, controller 100 includes a memory in which various measured and/or expected values and behaviors of tissue and bio-chemicals are stored. Controller 100 may be implanted, only the electrodes implanted or be wholly outside the body, optionally only with a sensor implanted, optionally with a sensor inserted as needed.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, controller 100 includes a molecule source 114 or controls an external molecule source (not shown), for example, using a data line or a wireless communication. Optionally, the molecule source sends a signal to controller 100 that a molecule was provided. Alternatively, an external trigger is used for both controller 100 and molecule source 114. Optionally, the source is provided using a tube or other delivery system 116. Such a source may be used, for example, as described below with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, controller 100 uses one or more external sensors 120 (e.g., body EGG) and/or an external control 118 to guide its behavior. Optionally, an external programmer/monitor is used for communication from a patient to a caregiver, for example, a hospital or monitoring agency. Optionally, such a programmer/monitor is used to send programs and/or setting to controller 100 and/or send queries regarding the effects of certain treatment sequences. Optionally, controller 100 maintains a log of physiological measures and/or applied sequences and/or synchronization thereof. The log may be limited to times before and after the treatment and/or include random times or times triggered by various physiological measurements.<br>
Controller 100 optionally provides one or more of the therapeutic effects listed following this paragraph. Optionally, when two or more effects are provided, the effects are provided simultaneously or alternately (e.g., alternating or otherwise intermixed electrification signals to have the multiple desired effects). In some cases, the behavior of the controller is modified to provide a tradeoff between multiple effects. Some of the effects may be enhanced and/or caused by modification of protein activity and/or mRNA expression. In some cases, the sequences used for "standard" effects are modified so that desired biochemical effects as described herein are achieved. Such modification may be by per patient optimization or by offline general quasi-optimization independent of any particular target patient Optionally, the controller is programmable, for example, using outside programming to perform one or more of the following therapies, as described elsewhere;<br><br>
a)	pacing;<br>
b)	contractility enhancement;<br>
c)	cardiac resynchronization;<br>
d)	conduction velocity modification;<br>
e)	remodeling;<br>
f)	arrhythmia treatment and/or prevention;<br>
g)	healing of diseased cardiac tissue; and h) stabilizing cardiac condition.<br>
Phosphorylation modification<br>
As noted above and as will be described below, it has been discovered that pulses originally designed for cardiac contractility modification (CCM) have an immediate and/or a long range effect on genomic expression (e.g., as evidenced by mRNA expression) and/or on protein activity. However, it is believed that other pulses also have such effects. In particular, CCM pulses often require a certain timing, which may not be required for some phosphorylation effects. In particular also, CCM pulses may need to be applied more often for significant CCM effects than for significant phosphorylation effects. In particular also, phosphorylation effects may be achieved even when CCM or at least contractility increase is reversed or null or fluctuates. In particular also, phosphorylation effects may also be achieved using excitatory signals or a combination of excitatory and non-excitatory signals and not only with pure non-excitatory signals.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, within seconds of applying the electric field to the tissue in-vivo or in-vitro, existing phospholamban protein is phosphorylated, without the need to synthesize more protein, but rather making use of what is already there in a "dephosphorylated state". In some embodiments, while the phosphorylation provides an "immediate response", the treatment and/or phosphorylation act as a trigger for later synthesis or change m synthesis of proteins.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or both of between beat and withm beat phosphorylation levels are controlled. For example, to reduce inter-beat effects, phosphorylation increase is kept at a level which cellular homeostasis mechanism can counteract by the next time a field is applied. In some cases, this requires one or both of control of field amplitude and frequency of application.<br>
Optionally, different proteins are differently controlled, for example intra-cellular and trans-membrane proteins.<br><br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart of a method of therapy taking phosphorylation (or other biochemical change) into account, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
At 402 a diagnosis of a patient is optionally made. Optionally, the patient is re-diagnosed as his therapy advances.<br>
At 404, one or more proteins to be affected by the electrical signals are selected. Optionally, the proteins are selected based on the diagnosis. Optionally, a set of related proteins, for example, calcium availability proteins, are selected. Optionally, one or more locations in the heart to be affected are selected. Optionally, target protein, mRNA and/or phosphorylation levels and/or other tissue or organ effects are selected.<br>
At 406, additional considerations are selected and/or rejected. In one example, the additional consideration is that the heart be paced and/or its LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) be increased. In a different example, considering that the pulses may be applied less often than pacing pulses, more painful treatments, such as external pulses, are used. Optionally, pro-arrhythmic pulses are used, for example, if the treatment is under a hospital setting or if the treatment is infrequent enough so that the total danger of arrhyflunia over a time period is within acceptable parameters. Controller 100 optionally includes a defibrillation and/or fencing function applied through the same or other electrodes. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, immediate reduction in cardiac efficiency is acceptable, as this is under controlled conditions and increased cardiac health will follow shortly (e.g., within minutes, hours, days or weeks).<br>
In another example, a protein modifying signal is applied as an exciting signal. In another example, a protein modifying signal is applied in parts of the cardiac cycle where it reduces contractility (or dP/dt) and/or prevents normal signal propagation in the heart. Optionally, the part of the heart to which the signal is applied is decoupled or deactivated, for example, by cold, by fencing or by various cardioplegia drugs.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is assumed that the protein modification signal has an effect that is at least partly independent of the point m the cardiac cycle at which it is applied, at least for some protems, such as proteins that are not electrically sensitive to the electrical cycle in the cell. For example, the effect depends on the availability of ATP for phosphorylation and not on the particular charge conditions in the cell. For some applied signals, the ion concentrations may have an effect on the efficacy of the signal and these may be dependent on the phase in cell depolarization/repolarization cycle. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the effect of a particular sequence and/or for a<br><br>
particular patient is taken into account when deciding on the strengtii and/or ether parameter of a signal.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is assumed that a CMM-type signal has multiple effects on cardiac tissue which may be targeted separately, at least to some extent. Some effects are causative, but may be at least partially decoupled or require multiple inputs to generate a particular desired result. Some of the effects are:<br>
a)	Effect on tissue polarization. This may include, for example, hyper-polarization, pacing and depolarization.<br>
b)	Effect on repolarization/depolarization cycle. This may include, for example, extending a plateau duration.<br>
c)	Effect on tissue function (external), for example, increased contraction strength and inhibition of mechanical and/or electrical activity.<br>
d)	Effect on protein phosphorylation.<br>
e)	Effect on genomic expression,<br>
f)	Short vs. long term effects (e.g., remodeling).<br>
At 408 a pulse sequence and/or application schedule (e.g., once a week) are optionally generated or selected, for example, usmg a look-up table or by searching for a solution. Many optimization and search methods are known in the art and may be used to help determine a treatment protocol; for example, linear programming, hill climbing and trial and error experimentation (e.g., manual or automatic experiments). The particular characteristics of the tissue and/or patient may also be determined, for example, by experimentation or by a table linkmg disease type to an expected (and/or desired) effect of a change in the protocol. The generation is optionally performed on controller 100. Optionally, the generation is at a treatment center, for example, if the patient comes in periodically for treatment or, if treatment is by remote means, by using a telephone link to control an implanted or external field source.<br>
At 410, the sequence is applied to the tissue.<br>
At 412, compensation for the effects of the sequence may be provided, if necessary, for example, anti-arrhythmia treatment or oxygen provision. Optionally, fee compensation is provided before and/or during the sequence application, or mtermingled therewith.<br>
At 414 an additional therapy and/or cofactor are optionally provided, which optionally mteract synergistically with the sequence, for example, on a cellular level or by one assisting the other to have an effect. In one example, the additional therapy is pharmaceutical. In another example, the additional therapy provides a cofactor or substrate which the proteins need to change their activity level. In another example, DNA therapy is made more specific by the<br><br>
proteins being generated and/or being activated by the field. In another example, exercise or rest is enforced so as to build-up a supply of substrate (e.g., protein or phosphor) on which the field can have an effect.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the additional therapy is applied systemically. Alternatively or additionally, at least one additional therapy is applied locally, for example, using targeting methods and/or local delivery methods as known in the art. Optionally, the methods of PCX publications WO 01/93951, WO 00/74773 and/or WO 01/93950, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference, are used. Optionally, in accordance with some of these methods, a same electrical field source applies both a therapeutic-effect field and a targeting/transport field.<br>
At 416, the effect of the field is optionally measured. Optionally, the measurement is in substantial real-time. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a gene or protein chip are used to detect protein, phosphorylation and/or mRNA levels. Alternatively or additionally, an optical sensor is used, for example an anti-body carrying optical detector. Optionally, the sensor is consumable and lasts, for example, for 5, 10, 20 or 100 uses (e.g., a multiplicity of single use sensors may be supplied). Optionally, spectroscopy methods are used, for example, Raman spectroscopy.<br>
While phosphorylation may be measured directly, optionally, cellular and/or organ behavior characteristics are measured instead, for example, stroke volume and effect on ECG.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, evaluation methods as described in US provisional application serial number 60/765,974, filed February 7, 2006, by mventors Benny ROUSSO et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, are used.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, evaluation is used to evaluate one or more of patents state, disease state and/or disease progression. Evaluation means may be included in controller 100 or be external to patient. Evaluation may be applied relatively continuously, for example more often than once a day, or less often for example, weekly or monthly or less often. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, evaluation is used to identify events where changes in therapy are desirable, for example, where therapy was insufficient, where patient reached his bounds or where adverse effects are found.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, evaluation comprises detecting changes in cardiac activation due to change sin conduction velocity. Optionally, the changes are detected by detecting a change m relative timing of events on an impedance measurement of the heart.<br><br>
At 418, the sequence is optionally repeated, optionally being modified according to the obtained results.<br>
Optionally, multiple feedback loops are maintained, for example, some parameters being measured on a second by second or minute by minute basis and others being measured on an hourly, daily, weekly and/or monthly schedule.<br>
Optionally, the measurements are off-line, for example, by biopsy taking. Optionally, the sample is frozen, for example in liquid nitrogen, to prevent changes. The results are optionally transmitted to controller 100,<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the intended effect of the electrical therapy is to tip a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms in the cell. For example, the electric field can be applied so that a protein (such as calcium channel) is more easily phosphorylated, while dephosphorylation mechanisms stay the same (or vice-versa). This can cause both an immediate (intra-beat) effect on phosphorylation levels and, possibly depending on the ratio between the immediate effect and the dephosphorylation mechanism, can cause a longer term increase.<br>
fa some cases, the long term increase is carried past normal levels, for example, to force a certain operation state of the controlled tissue.<br>
fa an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical modification of proteins is used to achieve an effect that does not directly translate into long term changes in protein levels.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical modification is used to trigger a change m cellular state. For example, once certain cellular balances are upset, cellular mechanism will then change the operational mode of the cell in a desired manner.<br>
fa an exemplary embodiment of the mvention, the electrical modification is used to support a failmg cellular mechanism so that the cell can recover.<br>
fa an exemplary embodiment of the mvention, electrical modification of biochemical behavior works together with existing control mechanism of the body, m addition to or instead of over-expression or under-expression of body biochemioals. fa an exemplary embodiment of the invention, existmg control mechanism are not disrupted, but rather utilized, for example, usmg existmg control mechanism to control functionality provided by the therapy, causfag existing control mechanism to act when they are inhibited from acting for some reason and/or inhibiting over-reactive control mechanism.<br>
fa an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical modification is used to damp or overcome an over-protective or run-away protection/control mechanism. One<br><br>
example, in cardiac cells, is a mechanism that when the cell feels over stressed, reduces contractility so that the cell can funnel its resources to viability. The electrical modification can be used to suppress this mechanism, so that contractility can resume, especially if the cell is actually capable of contraction and such contraction is suppressed or reduced by a run-away mechanism. Optionally, if there is a degradation in function, for example as detected by reduction in cardiac output or degraded ECG signals, the protein modification is stopped and is used as an indication that the cellular protection mechanism was not actually being over protective.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical modification increases calcium availability, thereby allowing existing control mechanism to "decide" if this increased availability should be utilized at any given instant to increase cardiac output. It is noted that the available increase and ability to work with existing mechanism can prevent degradation of heart tissue.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the therapy does not require any particular ligand or effector to tie to, but acts directly on bio-molecules.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical modification is not treated as a systemic therapy, but as a local therapy, for example, limited in effect to tissue directly or indirectly affected. Exemplary considerations for pulse and/or schedule design<br>
Further to the examples above, following are exemplary considerations to be taken into account during sequence and/or schedule design. In particular, pulse length, power, shape, intra-pulse delay, repetition rate and/or delay between sequences may be modified and/or optimized to have a desired effect (or mainly such a desired effect).<br>
a)	Pulse rate and length. Protein specificity is optionally achieved based on one or both of length of each pulse and delay between pulses. As noted, some proteins are significantiy affected by short pulses. Such a protein can be selectively affected by using shorter pulses than needed for other purposes, and repeating the pulses at inter-pulse delays shorter than a relaxation time for the affected protein. Optionally, proteins are targeted based on their location in the cell and the type (e.g., amplitude, fi-equency and/or waveform) of pulse that is expected to penetrate sufficiently into the cell and/or affect the particular protein. Optionally, pulse rate and/or delays and/or length are modified as needed to achieve a target. This allows for targeting the effect to a limited number of proteins.<br>
b)	mRNA vs. protein effects. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, mRNA and/or protein effects are selected by applymg pulses which have a short term effect on<br><br>
proteins but the effect is not long enough to trigger significant mRNA expression effects. For example, if a protein phosphorylation level is not elevated for long enough, it may be that mRNA effects will be absent. However, phosphorylation may be increased multiple discrete times (with delays between them). In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, some mRNA effects are directly determined by proteins, so that protein levels may be controlled in order to achieve selective mRNA effects.<br>
c)	Counter effects. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the control is selected so that mRNA effects and phosphorylation effects are not synchronized. For example, long plateaus of increased phosphorylation may be used to increase mRNA effect, but total phosphorylation modification may be selected to be Insignificant over a time period. One reason for this may be lack of sufficient blood flow to the heart, so that acute changes are less desirable than gradual changes. In another example, pharmaceuticals which counteract an effect may be provided to effectively select certain effect(s). It is noted however, that phosphorylation changes associated with increased contractility did not show increased oxygen demand, in some experiments at least and in at least one experiment, even reduction in oxygen demands.<br>
d)	Stability. Optionally, the long term effect of treatment is a new balanced set point . between the various proteins. However, m the short term, such a balancing need not be achieved. Optionally, the heart is controlled so that the various proteins are not at a balance with regard to their respective activities.<br>
e)	Physiological time scales. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the rate of application and/or duration relates to the time scales of physiological behavior, for example, sleep/wake cycles, eating times, time scale for formation of protein and/or mRNA transcription (e.g., 1-3 days and 1-4 hours, respectively).<br>
f)	Triggering. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a pulse sequence is applied and/or modified in response to a trigger event. In an exemplary embodiment of the mvention, controller 100 has stored thereon (or on an external controller) a table of situations and response (e.g., different sequence application parameters). Alternatively or additionally, to a table, other programming means may be used, for example, logic and neural networks. Exemplary trigger events include, stress, arrhythmia, ischemia, eating, resting, changes in concentration of biochemicals (e.g., intra-cellular, extra-cellular and/or blood) and/or changes in electrical signals (e.g., ECG, EMG and/or EEG). Possibly, this allows the sequences to be applied only where there is a need and/or when they will have a significant effect.<br><br>
g) Treatment of areas and combination of therapies. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, treatment is applied to multiple areas. Optionally, sequences are not applied in parallel to different areas, but in series. For example, one area being treated and then a second area is treated. Optionally, the duration of each treatment and/or cycle time depend on one or more of stabilization times, relaxation times and/or length of effect times. In one example, each area is treated one hour on and several hours off, with other areas (e.g., 2, 3, 4) being treated in the "off' time. In an example of therapy combination, if the allowed delay between applications of one therapy are longer than the application times of another therapy, the two therapies can be applied in a mixed manner to tissue. In some cases, two therapies can be applied simultaneously, for example, signals with different electrical frequencies, each of which has a selective effect on different biochemical pathways, for example, one signal which affects nerves (e.g., high frequency) and a second signal which affects phosphorylation.<br>
One example is found in skeletal muscles, where their biochemical state (aerobic or anaerobic) can depend on nerve stimulation. Optionally, nerve stimulation is used to prompt cells to be more (or less) sensitive to phosphorylation control of phospholamban.<br>
h) Noticeability of effects. In some cases, it may be desirable to prevent any immediate effects (e.g., contractility changes), while still providing therapy. For example, if only 10% of beats are treated, this may not be noticeable on a daily basis, but the cumulative effects of protein synthesis will be noticeable after a while. Optionally, the sequence is provided in a manner which will not be noticeable over time scales of minutes (e.g. 1-20), hours (e.g., 1-10) and/or days (e.g., 1-7). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the lack of noticeability is used to prevent interfering with the patient's lifestyle.<br>
i) Compliance. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, electrical field application does not require compliance from the patient and this can be a benefit. Optionally, applying the signal at a time when the patient is asleep, can prevent the patient from causing (intentionally or unintentionally) physiological states where the therapy is not applied for various reasons (e.g., safety, suitability). Optionally, however, compliance is required, for example, for taking of a medication that works together with the therapy. Optionally, if a patient does not indicate to the system that the medication was taken (e.g., using a wireless communication device), or if this lack is sensed by the system, the applied sequence is changed, initiated and/or inhibited, to compensate for this lack.<br>
j) Adaptation. In general, electrical signals are expected to be less susceptible to adaptation than pharmaceuticals, because the duration of electrical therapy and its onset can be controlled better than for pharmaceuticals. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br><br>
providing the therapy in a manner which is specific in time, prevent adaptation mechanism that relate to the mere existence of the therapy. Optionally, the therapy is changed over time, to prevent and/or counteract adaptation. Optionally, the therapy is changed when an adaptation is suggested by lack of or reduced reaction of the patient.<br>
In general, short term effects/goals and long term effects/goals may be at odds. Exemplary pulse properties<br>
While CCM pulses as described herein may be used, optionally, the pulses used are modified, for example, to save power and/or reduce the need for synchronization.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the applied pulses and/or sequences require considerably less power than CCM signals (e.g., 7.73 volts for 33 ms each 45 seconds), for example, only 20%, only 10%, only 5%, only 1%, or intermediate or smaller power usage. Optionally, the power per pulse is maintained, but the number of pulses in a time period is reduced, so that a cumulative power level is reduced (e.g., as compared to CCM signals).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the amplitude and/or duration used is insufficient for contractility, for example, being under the amount (if any) which causes a 20%, 10%, 3%, 2%, 1% or intermediate or smaller increase in contractility over a period of 5 minutes from initial application. For example, the application rate, power and/or duration are smaller.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the voltage used is lower than for CCM, for example, being 0.1, 0,5-1 volts, or less, or values such as 2V or 3V or other values smaller than 8 Volts. It should be noted that in the results shown below, the CCM signal was clearly more than required to achieve a meaningful phosphorylation, and thus a signal less powerful may be suitable. Larger voltages such as 10,20 or 30 volts may be used m some embodiments.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the duration of the pulses is as short as 1 ms (with an optional associated mcrease in power), or longer, such as 10 ms, 20 ms or more. Alternatively, the signal may be lengthened, for example, being 50, 100,150,200, 300, 400 ms or more. Optionally, medication which increases a refractory period is used in conjunction with long pulses. Optionally, fast and short term acting medication is used during pulse application.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the mvention, a total charge carried by a phosphorylation pulse is at least 5,10,30, 50 or 100 tunes the charge carried by a pacmg pulse, such as a 3V 0.75ms pulse.<br>
High power pulses are optionally applied as sub-threshold (for excitation) pulses.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the current for the pulse is between 0.2 ma and 20 mA, or intermediate or higher values. Other exemplary values for current (maximum current) are 0.4, 0.8, 1, 3, 7 or 10 mA (or intermediate values).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the applied signal comprises a series of pulses, for example, each pulse bemg bi-phasic, with each phase bemg 5,5 msec (--100 Hz), applied in synchronization with a local pacing activity (e.g., at a delay thereto). Optionally, the series is of 2-3 pulses, or a larger number, for example, 5, 10, 20 or more or intermediate numbers.<br>
Otlier waveforms can be used, for example, sinus waves or triangular waves. Optionally, a delay is provided between pulses of a series. Optionally, a pulse includes both excitatory and non-excitatory components.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, signals applied outside the absolute refractory period are applied at lower amplitudes. The relevant thresholds are optionally determined by experimentation or using standard values (noting that diseased tissue may have a lower threshold and/or abnormal refractory periods. Optionally, medication is provided to extend the refractory period and allow a greater charge and/or longer pulse sequence to be delivered during a single beat.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a tune-up of the pulse parameter is carried out, for example, to enable power to be reduced to a minimum which has an effect and/or as the patient response changes.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the application schedule includes reducing the number of applied sequences and/or increasing the delay between them. For example, as shown below, a 1 min application has an effect even after 15 mmutes. Thus, it is expected that a short application, for example, 20-60 seconds can be used to maintain more normalized phosphorylation levels for many mmutes, for example, 15, 20, 40, 60 minutes or more. Optionally, a small number of spurts can thus be used to maintain relatively "normalized" levels for many hours, such as 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 24 or more per hour (e.g., one spurt for each beat or small number of beats such as 2, 5, 10, 20 or intermediate numbers). It should be noted that reduced frequency of application reduces total power needs.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the delays between spurts are not electric field free. For example, a contmuous low level filed may be applied, for example for causing hyper polarization of the tissue, reducing contractility and/or modifymg immediate conduction velocity. Similarly, a pulse sequence may maintain a baseline signal (constant or varying) even between pulses of the sequence. Optionally, the base line signal is selected to be non-<br><br>
excitatory, for example, by virtue of its frequency (e.g., too high or too low) and/or power level. As noted herein, such a baseline signal may generate enough charge to positively affect phosphorylation.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, different stages in treatment are identified: immediate, mRNA, protein and physical remodeling. Each state has its own time constants for initiation and for decline. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a therapy is applied long enough to have a noticeable effect on the stage where effect is required. Times of no dierapy application may be selected to match the stage. For example, at remodeling stage, delays (no application times) of days or weeks may be acceptable. Optionally, even at such a remodeling stage, applications to continue a lower level stage (e.g., immediate) may be applied, at least part of the time. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a complete therapy plan may include desired effects on the different stages and an overlap of sequences and sequence application times is generated to address the stages required at the point in the process required. Optionally, a model is created linking the different stages and therapy application. This model is used to decide when therapy may be applied and when it must be applied. Further, additional therapies may be evaluated for application depending on bow they impact the overall strategy. In some cases, it is expected that computer modeling and/or such mechanisms will be required to find a useful solution for a give case.<br>
In some embodiments, power is lower to reduce battery requirement, to prevent noticeable effects by a patient and/or prevent immediate tissue effects. Optionally, power is reduced for safety or comfort reasons, for example, by selecting a power level that does not affect other tissue or parts of tissue than the tissue for which therapy is desired.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the comfort factor considered is pain caused by inadvertent stimulation of nerves. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, pain is reduced and/or avoided, by selecting a subset of a plurality of leads, electrodes and/or power settings which minimizes pain and/or discomfort, while still providing useful therapy (e.g., increase phosphorylation). Alternatively or additionally, what is mmimized is stimulation of the autonomous nervous system. Optionally, stimulation parameters are changed, as the patient habituates. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the effect of a signal is estimated by calculating the field which will reach target tissue and base don tables which link the field strength on effects. Optionally, the tables are generated using tissue homogenate and/or extracted cardiomyocytes. Optionally, the testing is on the patient's own tissue.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, pulse duration is in the range of 5-150msec, for example, 10-40 msec. Alternatively pulse duration may be of one or combmed<br><br>
groups in ranges such as Insec-0.5usec, 0.1-10usec, 1-100usec, 10-500usec, 100-1000usec, 500usec-10msec,1-100msec, 10-1000msec, 100-10000msec.<br>
Additional exemplary pulse properties are now described.<br>
Applied signals optionally are composed of such pulses, and their combinations. Signals may also be applied to excitatory tissue within the refractory period of such tissue, or outside such refractory period, or during a relative refractory period extending after the end of such period. Signals may be composed of pulses, square, saw-tooth, smooth or continuous waveforms, whether applied in stand alone pulses, in series, continuously, or superimposed.<br>
Signals may be applied on every tissue activation cycle, e.g. every heart beat, or other physiological cycle (breathing, sympathetic and parasympathetic systems cycle, other muscle contraction, etc). Alternatively, the application may be intermittently in only some of the cycles. Alternatively, signals may be applied at random timing or at a pre-determined timing.<br>
Treatment period may last, for example seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.<br>
Treatment may be alternating such as to be applied for some time period, and some rest period intermittently. For example, such treatment schedule may be activated for several hours (e.g. about 1-5 hours) every several hours (e.g. every 3-24 hours), or activated 12 hours out of every 24 hours (12 continuous hours every day or 12 intermittent hours: 1 hour on followed by 1 hour off).<br>
Treatment schedule may be configured for alternating among days or weeks, such as 3 days of treatment followed by 2 days of rest, repeatedly, or 4 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week of rest.<br>
Alternatively, signals may be applied to provide treatment in a manner that changes according to changes in physiological condition. Such change in physiological may be sensed by the device, or may be communicated to the device.<br>
Signals may be selected from a group of signals, each with properties selected for a desired effect, and the device may alternate among the signals, superimpose two or more of the signals, automatically adjust one or more of the signals, and/or change the ratio among the delivery time and magnitude of those signals. Genes and related proteins<br>
Following is a partial list of genes (and correspondmg proteins) whose expression is correlated with some types of heart failure (termed "heart failure" in short below). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, treatment is configured so that a particular gene/protein will be affected in a desirable manner. It is noted that in accordance with some<br><br>
embodirnents of the invention, different heart failure states are identified based on the protein expression, mRNA expression and/or protein activity profiles; or based on changes in such profiles in response to treatment, for example, immediate response or longer term response (e.g., hours, weeks or months). The treatment may target particular proteins, pathways or groups of proteins, for example, SR proteins. Optionally, the treatment aims to undo the negative effects described below, for example, by modifying the protein level and/or activity. Optionally, analysis and/or treatment relates simultaneously to several genes, for example a set of two, a set of three, a set of five or sets of other numbers of genes, for example genes selected form the list below. Optionally, the set includes genes from at least two or from at least three different gene type classifications. A profile used for assessment can include, for example, 1,2, 3,4, 5 or more markers from each of the types of mRNA, protein and protein activity. Various genes<br>
a)	AMP == atrial natriuretic peptide or A-type natriuretic peptide, is increased in heart failure. The increase in ANP is related to increased atrial enlargement and stretch which is bad. Increased ANP correlates with increased mortality and morbidity in heart ftulure,<br>
b)	BNP = Brain natriuretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide is increased in heart failure. BNP is elaborated from ventricular tissue. The increase in BNP is due largely to increased LV size and stretch which is bad in heart failure. tality and/or morbidity. BNP is also a member of the so-called "fetal gene program" whichIncreased BNP in heart failure correlates with increased mor also negatively impacts heart failure.<br>
c)	GAPDH. This is a gene whose expression does not change in heart failure and is used as "a housekeeping gene" to ensure good quality RNA extraction. If the expression of this gene changes durmg RT-PCR this may indicate poor RNA quality and the results of all other gene expression measurements may become qestionable.<br>
SR genes<br>
d)	RYR2 = ryanodine receptors also referred to as sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels. These channels control the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is the calcium signal that is needed to activate the contractile apparatus (actin myosin cross bridging). These channels are hyperphosphorylated in heart failure and turn very active and, therefore, are "leaky," leading to possible calcium overload which is bad for the heart muscle cell. Reducing or normalizing phosphorylation may be desirable for these proteins.<br>
e)	NCX " sodium calcium exchanger. Under normal conditions, the NCX takes calcium out of the cell in return for Na. This maintains calcium homeostasis and prevents calcium<br><br>
overload which is bad for muscle cell function and survival. In heart failure the NCX is increased and is hyperphosphorylated and may begin to work in what is called "reverse mode", to compensate for reduced SERCA-2A activity, and may cause calcium overload ("diastolic dys&amp;nction). Too much activity in forward mode depletes SR calcium (=systolic dysfunction).<br>
f)	PLB - Phospholamban. This is an essential sarcoplasmic reticulum protein. Under<br>
normal conditions PLB is phosphorylated (PLB-P). When that happens it activates SERCA-2a<br>
(calcium ATPase) which then pumps calcium from the cytosol into the SR and thus prevents<br>
calcium overload. PLB is decreased in heart failure and is dephosphorylated. Because of that,<br>
SERCA-2a activity is reduced and it is less able to pump calcium back into the sarcoplasmic<br>
reticulum. This leads to calcium overload. When the SR has reduced calcium, there is less<br>
calcium release through the calcium release channels and contractility decreases.<br>
g)	SERCA-2a = calcium ATPase. This sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) pump, under<br>
normal conditions, pumps calcium from the cytosol into the SR. In heart failure SERCA-2a<br>
decreases dramatically and its activity also decreases leading to calcium overload and poor<br>
intracellular calcium cycling. This decreases contraction strength.<br>
h)  Calsequestrin  (CSQ).   Clasequestrin  is  an  SR  protein  involved  in  calcium sequestration and does not change in heart failure. Because it does not change m heart failure, it is frequently used as a housekeeping gene. It may also be used to normalize when samples are inconsistent in the loading process. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)<br>
i) MMPl. This gene is involved in the degradation of connective tissue at all levels and, for this reason, its elevation in heart failure is not desirable and counteracted in some embodiments of the mvention.<br>
j) MMP2 and MMP9. These are referred to as to as "gelatinases". Inhibiting gelatinases m the setting of heart failure appears to be helpful particularly with respect to reducing "interstitial fibrosis" or the accumulation of connective tissue or collagen in the cardiac interstitium. Reducing interstitial fibrosis leads to unproved LV diastolic compliance and, hence, improved diastolic filling and function. Stretch Response Genes<br>
Stretch response genes are up-regulated in the presence of progressive LV dilation and myocytes stretch as occurs in heart failure. The importance of these genes is they trigger maladaptive cardiomyocytes hypertrophy which then leads to abnormal calcium cycling,<br>
k) p38 == p38 alpha-beta mitogen activated protein kinese. This is a stretch response gene. Its expression increases in heart failure and that can lead to many abnormalities mcluding<br><br>
the development of hypertrophy and activation of multiple transcription factors that lead to activation of the fetal gene program. An increase in P38 correlates with maladaptive hypertrophy and ventricular enlargement. This indicates a bad prognosis for heart failure.<br>
1) p21 ras = This is also a stretch response gene. Its expression increases in heart failure due to ventricular enlargement and stretch. When stretch and wall stress increases in heart failure, these mechanical factors increase a family of cell surface proteins known as integrins. Integrins, when activated, lead to increase in p21 ras and p38 and both lead to maladaptive hypertrophy.<br>
m) Integrin-a5. This is a cell surface receptor gene whose protein acts as a mechanical transducer. It is activated in response to mechanical stretch or stress mediated by LV dilation. When activated, it promotes regulation of stretch response protein. Down regulation of this gene in heart failure is a desirable feature of some embodiments of the invention. Fetal Program Genes<br>
n) Alpha-MHC = alpha myosin heavy chain is reduced in heart failure. Because the alpha isoform of MHC is the isoform responsible for increased velocity of shortening of cardiac muscle cells, a reduction in alpha MHC impacts negatively on function/contraction of the failing ventricle. Alpha MHC restoration is associated (and optionally provided by some embodiments of the invention) with LV contraction improvements.<br>
o) Betal-Adrenergic Receptor. This gene is down-regulated in heart failure. Drugs such as metoprolol which are selective beta-1 receptor blockers which up-regulate the beta-1 receptor improve mortality and morbidity in heart failure and appear to also improve, albeit in a limited way, exercise tolerance. Up-regulation of this gene is viewed as a positive development in some embodiments of the invention which enhances the sensitivity of the contractile element of catecholamines.<br>
SERCA-2a, mentioned above, is also a member of the so-called fetal program gene. Calcium Binding Proteins<br>
Enhanced expression of calcium bindmg proteins such as S100Al and sorcin improve contractility by increasing calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Expression of these proteins can also modify the behaviors of ryanodine calcium release channels. Alternatively down-regulation (or avoiding upregulation) of these calcium binding proteins can diminish contractility. This may be applicable to hypercontractile states of the heart associated with certain diseases such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Contractility may also be reduced using hyperpolarizing fields. Experimental results - long term ("chronic") and short term (several hours)<br><br>
Before describing experiments in which an immediate effect was discovered on phosphorylation, experiments on relatively long term effects will be described, including effects that occur (at least to a significant degree) after a few hours of continuous CCM application and after 3 months. These experiments generally show that LV function in dogs with HF improves without an associated increase in MVO2.<br>
In this experimental preparation, chronic HF is produced by multiple sequential intracoronary embolizations with polystyrene Latex microspheres (70-102 µm in diameter) which result in loss of viable myocardium, LV enlargement and a decrease in LV ejection fraction. 14 healthy mongrel dogs weighing between 20 and 30 kg underwent coronary microembolizations to produce HF. Embolizations were performed one week apart and were discontinued when LV ejection fraction, determined angiographically, was 
Two weeks after the target LV ejection fraction was reached, dogs were anesthetized as described above, intubated and ventilated with room air. The right external jugular vein was surgically exposed and used to position the CCM leads. Two standard active fixation leads were advanced into the right ventricle and positioned on the anterior and posterior septal grooves and were used to sense ventricular activity and deliver CCM electrical signals. A third active fixation lead was positioned in the right atrium for p-wave sensing. The leads were connected to a CCM signal generator (OPTIMIZER"™ H, Impulse Dynamics NV, Curacao NV), The generator was implanted in a subcutaneous pocket created on the right side of the neck. All 14 animals were implanted and all were allowed to recover. Studies were performed 2 weeks after OPTIMIZERTM System implantation. This period of time was allowed to ensure that the leads stabilized in place.<br>
Two weeks after OPTIMIZER™ System implantation, dogs were anesthetized and underwent a pre-treatment left and right heart catheterization to assess hemodynamics and measure MVO2. Dogs were then randomized to an active treatment group (n=7) or to a sham-operated control group (n=7). In the active treatment group, the OPTIMIZERTM system was activated to deliver CCM therapy, CCM therapy was admmistered for 5 hours/day based on a duty cycle of one hour ON (CCM signal ± 7.73 volts) and 3 hours and 48 minutes OFF for 3 months. Sham-operated control dogs did not receive any therapy whatsoever and were also followed for 3 months. At the end of 3 months of therapy or follow-up, all hemodynamic<br><br>
measures were repeated including MVO2. After completion of all hemodynamic measurements and while under general anesthesia, the dogs' chest was opened and the heart rapidly harvested and tissue from the inter-ventricular septum and LV free wall was obtained and prepared for histological and biochemical evaluation. Tissue from 6 normal dogs was obtained and prepared in the same manner and used for comparisons. AH tissue was stored at -70°C until needed.<br>
To address certain aspects of the mechanisms of action of CCM therapy, a series of 6 additional dogs underwent intracoronary microembolizations to produce HF as described earlier. In these dogs, under general anesthesia, a mid-sternotomy was performed, the pericardium was opened and epicardial CCM leads were placed on the anterior wall between the 2nd and 3rd diagonal branches. Hemodynamic measurements including measurements of MVO2 were made before and 2 hours after continuous CCM signal delivery at 7.73 volts. At the end of 2 hours of therapy, myocardial samples were obtained from the LV anterior wall in the region of the CCM leads and from the LV posterior wall remote from the CCM leads. Left ventricular tissue from 6 normal dogs and 6 HF dogs that were untreated was obtained and prepared in the same manner and used for comparisons. All tissue was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until needed.<br>
Aortic and LV pressures were measured with catheter-tip micromanometers (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) during cardiac catheterization. LV end-diastolic pressure was measured from the LV waveform. Single-plane left ventriculograms were obtained during each catheterization after completion of the hemodynamic measurements with the dog placed on its right side. Ventriculograms (approximately 60 right anterior oblique projection) were recorded on 35mm cine film at 30 frames per second during the injection of 20 ml of contrast material (Reno-M-60, Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Correction for image magnification was made with a radiopaque calibrated grid placed at the level of the LV. LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were calculated from ventricular silhouettes using the area-length method, such as described in Dodge HT, Sandler H, Baxley WA, Hawley RR. Usefulness and limitations of radiographic methods for determining left ventricular volume. Am J Cardiol 1966;18:10-24, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Stroke volume was calculated as the difference between LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume. Total coronary blood flow (CBF), and MVO2, were measured and calculated as described, for example, m Chandler MP, Stanley WC, Morita H, Suzuki G, Roth BA, Blackburn B, WoIff F A, Sabbah HN. Acute treatment with ranolazine improves mechanical efficiency in dogs with chronic heart failure. Ore Res, 2002;91:278-280, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br><br>

Calsequestrin (CSQ), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (3NP), ryanodine receptor (RyR), total phospholamban (PLB), phosphorylated PLB (P-PLB), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium ATPase (SERCA-2a), and β2-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) were measured by Western Blots. Briefly, LV homogenate was prepared from -100 mg LV powder as described, for example, in Gupta RC, Mishra S., Mishima T, Goldstein S, Sabbah HN.

CSQ, a calcium-bindmg protein located in the SR and is unchanged in HF was used to normalize protein loading on the gel Approximately 20-100 µg protein of each sample was separated on 4-20% SDS-poIyacrylamide gel and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The accuracy of the electrotransfer was confirmed by staining the membrane with 0.1% amido black. For identification of the desired protein, the nitrocellulose blot was incubated with the appropriately diluted primary monoclonal or polyclonal antibody specific to each protein based on the supplier's instructions. Antibody-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography after treating the blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) and BCL color developing reagents. ANP, BNP, Pi-AR, SERCA-2a, PLB, or RyR-specific antibody recognized 20, 14, 65, 110, 5.5, and 250 kDa protein bands respectively. Total P-PLB was quantified in SDS-phosphoprotein-enriched fraction (PPE) prepared from LV homogenate using PLB specific monoclonal antibody. P-PLB at serine-16 or threonine-17 was quantified in SDS-LV homogenate using primary antibodies specific to the P-PLB at serine-16 or at threonine-17. PPE was prepared firom LV tissue usmg a BD Bioscience phosphoprotein enrichment kit, for example as described in Gupta RC, Mishra S, Yang XP, Sabbah HN* Reduced inhibitor 1 and 2 activity is associated with increased protein phosphatase type 1 activity in left ventricular myocardium of one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats.

Band intensity was quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imagmg densitometer and expressed as densitometric units x mm2. In all instances, the antibody was present in excess over the antigen and the density of each protein band was in the linear scale.<br><br>
mRNA expression of glyseraIdehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDPI), α-myosin heavy chain (MHC), βAR, ANP, BNP, SERCA-2a, total PLB, RyR and CSQ was measured. Total RNA with an absorbance ratio (260 nm/280 nm) above 1.7 was isolated from frozen LV tissue as described in Mol Cell Biochem. 2005;269:49-57. Approximately 4-10 µg RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in an assay volume of 80 microliterv For each polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 2-5µl first-strand cDNA was added to 50 \i\ of a reaction mixture containing 20 pmol of each forward and reverse primer of each gene, 200 |iM of each dNTP, 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.8), 50 mM KCl, QA% Triton-XlOO and 3.0 mM MgCb and 1 unit platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and PCR allowed to proceed for 20 to 40 cycles. For each gene, PCR cycle was determined to ensure that the gene product is forming in linear range. PCR products were analyzed by subjecting 20 µl of each reaction mixture to electrophoresis on 1%-1.5% ethidium-bromide-agarose gels. Band size of the products was compared with standard DNA size markers and confirmed by sequencing of the forward (F) and reverse (R) primers for each gene and gene product, mRNA expression of a-MHC was measured by amplification of cDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR followed by digestion with Pstl restriction enzyme as described, for example, in Feldman AM, Ray PE, Silan CM, Mercer JA, Minobe W, Bristow MR.

Fluorescent band intensity was quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer and expressed as optical density x mm .<br>
From each heart, 3 transverse slices (approximately 3 mm thick) one each from basal, middle and- apical thirds of the LV, were obtained. For comparison, tissue samples obtained from 7 normal dogs were prepared in an identical manner. From each slice, transmural tissue blocks were obtamed and embedded in paraffin blocks. From each block, 6 µm thick sections were prepared and stained with Gomori trichrome to identify fibrous tissue. The volume fraction of replacement fibrosis, namely, the proportion of scar tissue to viable tissue in all three transverse LV slices, was calculated as the percent total surface area occupied by fibrous tissue using computer-based video densitometry (MOCHA, Jaudel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Transmural tissue blocks were obtained from the free wall segment of the slice, mounted on cork usmg Tissue-Tek embedding medium (Sakura, Torrance, CA), and rapidly frozen in isopentane pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until used. Cryostat sections were prepared and stained with fluorescem-labeled peanut agglutinin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) after pretreatment with 3.3 U/ml neuraminidase type V (Sigma Chemical<br><br>
Co., St. Louis, MO) to delineate the myocyte border and the interstitial space, including capillaries, for example as described in Liu YH, Yang XP, Sharov VG, Nass O, Sabbah HN, Peterson E, Carretero OA.

J,  Clin Invest 1997;99:1926-1935, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Sections were double stained with rhodamine-labeled Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I (GSL I) to identify capillaries. Ten radially oriented microscopic fields (magnification x100, objective x40, and ocular 2.5), were selected at random from each section and photographed using 35 mm color film. Fields containing scar tissue (infarcts) were excluded. Average cross-sectional area of each myocyte was measured using computer-based planimetry. The volume fraction of interstitial collagen (reactive interstitial fibrosis) was calculated as the percent total surface area occupied by interstitial space, minus the percent total area occupied by capillaries (following J Clin Invest 1997;99:1926-1935 ). Capillary density was calculated as the number of capillaries per square millimeter and as the index capillary per fiber ratio. The oxygen diffusion distance was measured as half the distance between two adjoining capillaries.<br>
To ensure that all hemodynamic measures were similar at baseline, comparisons were made between the two study groups before any embolization and at the tune of randomization before initiating active therapy. To assess treatment effect, the change in each measure from pre-treatment to post-treatment was calculated for each of the study groups and then compared between groups. For these comparisons a t-statistic for two means was used with a probability value 
The results of tiiese Kcperiments are presented m summary below and in greater detail after.<br>
At baseline, all dogs entered into the study had hemodynamic measures that were within normal limits for conditioned mongrel dogs. The hemodynamic and ventriculographic results obtained before initiating therapy or follow-up (pre-treatment) and 3 months after faiitiating therapy or follow-up (post-treatment) are shown in Table 1 for dogs randomized into<br><br>
the CCM-active treatment group and Table 2 for dogs randomized into the sham-operated untreated HF group. In nham-operated dogs, comparison of pre-treatment to post-treatment showed no differences in heart rate, systolic aortic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure or stroke volume (Table 1). In this group, LV end-diastolic and end-systoiic volume increased significantly while LV ejection fraction decreased significantly. This was associated with an increase in totat CBF and an increase in MVO2. LV mechanical efficiency tended to decrease but the reduction was not statistically significant (Table 1).<br>

Ill CCM-treated dogs, comparison of pre-treatment to post-treatment also showed no differences in heart rate and systolic aortic pressure. LV end-diastolic pressure decreased as did LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume while stroke volume and LV ejection fraction increased (Table 2), This functional improvement was associated with a decrease in total CBF and a decrease in MVO2 along with a significant increase in LV mechanical efficiency (Table 2).<br>

The change (Δ) in hemodynamic and ventriculographic measures from pre-treatment to post-treatment was compared between the two study groups (Table 3), Heart rate and systolic aortic pressure were unchanged. Compared to sham-operated controls, CCM-treated dogs had a significantly lower LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic volume and end-systolio volume along with significantly higher LV ejection fraction and stroke volume (Table 3). This improvement in LV fimction in CCM-treated dogs was accompanied by a significant reduction of CBF and MVO2 and a significant increase in LV mechanical efficiency (Table 3).<br><br>

Histomorphometric results are shown in Table 4. Volume fraction of replacement fibrosis, volume fraction of interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area were significantly higher in sham-operated dogs compared with normal dogs. Volume fraction of replacemnent fibrosis was reduced by 23%, volume fraction of interstitial fibrosis was reduced by 16% and average cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was reduced by 19% compared to sham-operated HF dogs.

In a set of short term experiments, 6 dogs that had micro-embolization induced HF were used. The CCM signal was a 7.73 volt, epicardial LV anterior wall signal. The definitions for the various variables follow Circulation Research 91:278, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The signal is applied to the epicardial surface of the heart.<br>
Where not otherwise specified, CCM is a pulse at 80 applications per minute (synchronized to a heart beat, if any), at 7,73 Volts, with between 4 and 6 phases, each phase being 5.56 ms long and being continuous and of opposite polarity of a previous phase. The number of phases was not changed within an experiment. The signal was generally applied to a septum, from a right chamber, with a distance of 1-2 cm between an electrode pair used to apply the signal.<br><br>
The marking 'NL" indicates normal tissue levels.<br>
Figs. 2A-2C show the improvement of LV function without MVO2 increase, in CCM<br>
treated dogs as a function of time and compared to baseline values.<br>
Figs. 2D-2G show changes in mRNA expression of alpha-MHC, ANP, BNP and SERCA-2a in normal, HP and HF dogs with CCM treatment respectively, after several hours oftreatment.<br>
As will be shown below, effects on protein phosphorylation (at least) can be shown after a short time.<br>
Fig. 2H shows phosphorylated phospholamban normalized to total phospholamban following therapy of several hours (indicated herein as "short-term"). Fig. 21 shows corresponding blots using a Western Blotting method. It should be noted that both phospholamban levels and phosphorylation levels thereof improve with therapy.<br>
Fig. 2J shows reduction m mRNA expression of NCX following CCM treatment Fig. 2K shows a general (or slight reduction) normalization of NCX protein values while still maintaining mcreased relative phosphorylation. This may allow some compensation for disturbed cardiac function.<br>
Fig. 2L shows decreased mRNA expression of GATA-4, to even below normal levels. Fig. 2M shows that protein expression of GATA-4, is however, still increased relative to normal. This may be useful for control of NCX and/or other proteins. This result also indicates that merely controlling mRNA may not sufficiently determine the cellular behavior, as protein levels and/or phosphorylation levels may compensate or over compensate. In general, however, the levels are normalized as compared to HF.<br>
Figs. 2N and 20 show the effect of chronic (e.g., 3 month) treatment with CCM on mRNA expression profiles. Normalization of these important proteins can be seen.<br>
It should be noted that the electric field can operate differently on different proteins, for example, directly affecting some proteins and these proteins indirectly affecting the behavior and/or levels of other proteins. It should also be noted that there are multiple pathways m the cells and the electrical treatment may affect multiple (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4 or more) pathways in parallel. The resulting effects on proteins may be increasing or decreasing their expression and/or activity levels. Different such effects may be desirable for different proteins and/or different disease conditions. Different proteins may be predisposed (e.g., based on their structure, surrounding materials and/or existing pathways) to differently increase and/or decrease. A particular experiment with Phospholamban is described below.<br><br>
The following tables summarize the results on mRNA expression for normal dogs (NL), dogs with HF and dogs with HF and chronio CCM treatment. Protein levels and phosphorylation levels are described later on. A summarizing table is also provided later on in the application.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Short discussion of some results<br>
Phospholamban is down regulated in heart failure and is nearly normalized with CCM therapy. This may explam the improvement in LV function by CCM treatment. CCM appears to normalize the RYR message which is consistent with proper therapy, The up-regulation of alpha-MHC with CCM may be contributing to the sustained long-term improvement in LV ejection fraction. Decrease in MMPl following CCM therapy is in and of itself desirable. Inhibiting gelatinases, as shown, is beneficial, possibly reducing interstitial fibrosis and leading to improved LV diastolic compliance and, hence, improved diastolic filling and function. p21RAS and p38 mitogen activated protein kinese (MAPK) are emissions of stretch response genes which are down-regulated following CCM therapy and correlate with reduced cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. Integrin-a5 is clearly normalized following long-term CCM therapy, Up-regulation of Betal-Adrenergic Receptor is viewed as a positive development which enhances the sensitivity of the contractile element of catecholamines. Beta-blockers are known to enhance the sensitivity of the myocardium to exogenous as well as endogenous catecholamines when used in heart failure patients over long periods of time m excess of 3 months. In the normal heart, beta blockers reduce the sensitivity of the heart to catecholamines. As will be described below, the therapies as described herem may be used together with beta-blockers, for both short and long term synergistic effects.<br>
Possibly, some therapies according to the present invention will focus on general improvement of health, while other therapies will focus on increasing tissue responsiveness, for example, to certain drugs, and thus focus on improving fewer than all mRNA and/or protein and/or phosphorylation indicators.<br><br>
Experimental results - immediate<br>
The inventors of the present application have discovered that, surprisingly, phosphorylation effects for at least some proteins can be generated in immediate time frames, such as less than 1 minute and even less than 10 or 5 seconds in some cases. Further, an immediacy of effect is also characterized by a reduced number of intermediate stages, indicated by the fact that protein phosphorylation effects can be imposed even in tissue homogenate. Further, specificity of the phosphorylation effects to certain proteins that are relevant for HF is also shown. Further, a lack of effect of an exemplary pacing signal is also shown. Tissue homogenate<br>
Figs. 3 A and 3B show the effect of a CMM signal applied to tissue homogenate from LV failed heart tissue. As can be seen, even a 10 second signal was sufficient to generate noticeable and significant changes in phosphorylation. Changes in phosphorylation are shown in Serine-16 Monometric PLB (Phospholamban) form, Threonin-17 mometric PLB form. Serine 16 Pentametric PLB form and Ryanodine channels.<br>
The tissue homogenate was prepared m the following manner. Approximately 14g frozen LV tissue from a dog with chronic HF in 42 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was homogenized three times for 20 seconds each time using a 10-mm generator (Omni International, Waterbury, CT) at setting 10. The homogenate was then filtered through 4 layers of cheese cloth. The resulting homogenate was stored in ice and its protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method.<br>
The CCM signals were delivered to the homogenate as follows. The homogenate was diluted 2 fold in homogenate buffer and subsequently aliquotted 3 ml each in assay tubes. Assay tubes were divided into 2 sets (Set A and Set B), each subset consisting of 7 assay tubes. CCM signals were delivered for 10", 30", 1', 5', 30', and 60' m one of the sets, while the other set served as time control. The reaction was stopped by adding concentrated SDS. Protein assay on all the samples were performed by Lowry method.<br>
Phosphorylation of PLB at serine-16 (Ser-16) and threonine-17 (Thr-17) was determined by Western blotting using specific antibody as described in Mishra S, Sabbah HN, Jain JC, Gupta RC: "Reduced Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity and expression in LV myocardium of dogs with heart Mure", Am J Physiol Heart Cric Physiol 284:H876-H883, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, approximately 100 microgram protein for Se-16 and 40 microgram for Thr-17 were elecrophoresed on 18% SDS-gel, protein was transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose<br><br>
membrane, the blot was probed with primary and secondary antibodies and finally bands were visualized by an ECL method.<br>
It should be noted that tissue homogenate was generally activated at room temperature, below the normal operating temperature of a heart. This and other features of the results suggest a direct chemical or electrical effect on the proteins which is possibly divorced or semi divorced from cell function and/or complex biochemical mechanisms(e.g., more than two or three steps or with feedback). Such divorcing may help in the application of the effect under various conditions including various polarization conditions and tissue health states. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is noted that the effect does not directly depend on the membrane polarization of the cell, therefore, this phosphorylation effect may be achieved at times other than a refractory period. Dependmg on the non-excitatory signal applied, therapy may be applied during a refractory period to avoid inadvertent pacing. However, if the tissue is desensitized, for example, using a suitable electrical signal, cold, or pharmaceutical, there is no need for specific timing. In another example, suitable charge provided during a pacing signal may be sufficient for a therapeutic effect.<br>
For example, a typical pacing pulse is up to 1ms and 5V, which at 500 Ohm lead impedance is 50 micro-joule. A CCM pulse as described herein is 2000 micro-joule per pulse and more if multiple pulses are provided m a single sequence (e.g., 4 pulses = 8000 micro-joules).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the provided charge per beat is at least 100, at least 300. at lest 500, at least 1000, at least 2000, at least 5000 or more or intermediate values of micro-joules. It is hypothesized, that at least for some treatments, the applied field has to be above a minimum charge per heart beat, or the effect is lost, for example, due to electrical masking in the cell or due to biochemical interactions that occur within a heart beat.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the applied energy is directed mostly at a<br>
tissue having a volume of less than 20 cm2, less than 10 cm2, less than 5 cm2, less than 3 cm2<br>
or larger or intermediate volumes.<br>
Phosphorylation dependency on Protein Kinese (PK) inhibitors<br>
Additional experiments of tissue homogenote were carried out in the presence and absence of protein kinese inhibitors. The homogenate was the same as above, from dogs with heart failure. Two different phosphorylation locations (threonin-17 and serine-16) on phospholamban produced two different results in the presence of the kinese inhibitors (in its absence, the above results were reproduced). The kmese inhibitor is STAUROSPORIN, a Pale yellow solid. Advertised as a potent, cell-permeable, and broad spectrum inhibitor of protein<br><br>
kinases. Inhibits protein kinase A (IC50 = 7 nM), CdM kinase (IC50 == 20 nM), myosin light chain kinase (IC50 = 1.3 nM), protein kinase C (IC50 = 700 µM), and protein kinase G (IC50 = 8.5 nM). Also inhibits platelet aggregation induced by collagen or ADP but has no effect on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, Induces apoptosis in human malignant glioma cell lines. Arrests normal cells at the G1 checkpoint. Purity: &gt;97% by HPLC CAS 62996-74-1. In the presence of the kinese inhibitors serine-16 responded close to usual, possibly with a somewhat delayed and/or reduced response (statistics are weak) and threonin-I7 has a reduced and delayed response, in that no immediate effect was apparent, but some effect was apparent under longer stimulation times. This suggests two things. Firsts the pathways for phosphorylation are different for the two locations, when stimulated by an electric field. Second, there appears to be a synergistic effect between kinese and electric field application. These differential and synergist effects suggest the ability to select pathways in affecting tissue<br>
Without being limited to any particular hypothesis, it is hypothesized by the inventors that the synergistic effect is caused by the behavior of Akt (or similar proteins), which is described in a paper Gallo P, Santonastasi M, Ceci M, Scimia C, Di Sciascio G, Condorelli G. Akt overexpression improves cardiac function and ameliorates heart failure m pressure overload animal model phosphorylating key Ca2+ handling proteins. J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;21:76A, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In this paper, it is shown that Akt selectively phosphorylates phospholamban at the threonin-17 site. In this, non-limiting explanation, the different sites on phospholamban are physiologically set up to be phosphorylated under different mechanism and while an electric field has a direct effect on both locations, one location is more sensitive to electric fields and the other location is more sensitive to biochemical interaction (or at least such as mediated by kinese). It is further hypothesized that the effect of the electric field applied by the therapy mimics (possibly m an enhanced manner) a regulated effect provided naturally by electrical activity of the heart.<br>
The following tables summarize the experimental results for serine-16:<br><br><br><br><br>
. Failed Cardiomyocytes, pacing and CCM<br>
Fig. 3C shows phosphorylation of a Ryanodine receptor in isolated (in-vitro) failed cardiomyocytes, after application of CCM for iO. 20, 30 and 60 seconds. Lack of significant immediate effect is consistent with the lack of long-term effect shown above and serves to show that the effect of the CCM signal can be made specific to certain proteins.<br>
Fig. 3D shows phosphorylation of PLB and GATA, as compared to that of CSQ, in failed isolated myocytes. As can be seen a phosphorylation effect is shown for some of the proteins, which matches the general results for tissue homogenate. Also noteworthy is that the effect increases over time at different rates for different proteins. Relaxation times of phosphorylation levels for different proteins are also generally different. The change m GATA-4 is important because when GATA-4 is phosphorylated, this process decreases the activity of the sodium calcium exchanger and helps contractility improve quickly.<br>
Fig. 3E shows that a pacing signal applied at 3V for pulses of 0,75 msec did not have any significant immediate effect on any of the proteins. Possibly, this is caused by the reduced current density of the pacing pulse and/or due to the substantially lower charge transport rate. Possibly, any minimal effect of the pacing signal is relaxed in the times between signals. Optionally, the pacing signal is not strong enough to pass a certain minimal threshold of effect. In Vivo Heart<br>
The following tables summarize the results from 2 heart failure dogs in which phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB-P) after application of CCM signals was studied, while taking biopsies at 1,5,10, and 15 minutes. Normalization to CSQ was used to correct for any effect of blood in the biopsies. The increase in PLB-P matches a measured increase in dP/dt measured m these experiments. It is noted that PLB-P levels remained elevated for 15 minutes after application of CCM, suggesting a temporally sparse field application treatment. Optionally, such a prolonged elevation has a long term effect on mRNA expression. Various locations on the LV were tried, all with similar results, as shown below.<br><br><br><br>
Without being limited to any particular hypothesis, it is hypothesized by the inventors that the applied electric field either has a direct effect on the proteins or has an effect on a<br><br>
cofactor or protein that enhance phosphorylation of proteins. The above "Voltage-dependent potentiation  ,.." paper suggests that an electric field can directly modify the natural phosphorylation rate of a protein. Human results<br>
mRNA expression levels were measured for some genes in human subjects. Therapy with non-excitatory cardiac contractility modulation (CGM) electrical signals was delivered to LV muscle during the absolute refractory period improves LV function in patients with HF. The effects of 3 months CCM therapy on mRNA expression of cardiac fetal and SR genes in 5 patients with advanced HF were examined. In the experiment, right sided endomyocardial biopsies were obtained at baseline, prior to activating CCM therapy, and at 3 and 6 months thereafter. CCM therapy was delivered in random order of ON for 3 months and OFF for 3 months. mRNA expression measurement was performed in a blinded fashion as to the ON/OFF order of therapy. Expression of the fetal genes A-type (ANP) and B-type (BNP) natriuretic peptides and a-myosin heavy chain (MHC), and the SR genes SERCA-2a, phospholamban (PLB) and ryanodine receptors (RYR) was measured using RT-PCR and bands quantified in densitometric units (du). The percent change in du between baseline and the ON and OFF 3 months phases was calculated.<br>
The 3 months therapy OFF phase was associated with increased expression of ANP and BNP and decreased expression of a-MHC, SERCA-2a, PLB and RYR (Table). In contrast, the 3 months ON therapy phase resulted in decreased expression of ANP and BNP and increased expression of a-MHC, SERCA-2a, PLB and RYR (Table). This suggests that m patients with HF, CCM therapy reverses the cardiac maladaptive fetal gene program and normalizes expression of key SR Ca2+ cycling genes. These observations are consistent with tiie observed improvement in LV fimction in patients with HF followuig long-term CCM therapy.<br><br><br>
Protein results<br>
Figs. 5A-5R shows protein expression results for the following proteins in chronic dogs, in control, heart failure and treated heart failure conditions: CSQ, SERCA-2a, PLB, RyR, NCX, lL-6, GATA-4, GAPDH, MMP-9, Tubulin-Beta, GATA-l, MMPA, Tubulin-Alpha, Titin, TMP-l, Integrin-α5, TNF α, p21ras, p38 MAPK, TIMP-2, βI-AR, MMP-2, ANP and<br>
BMP.<br>
It should be noted that some blots are shown twice, in order to facilitate comparison between them.<br>
Following is a tabular analysis of these results with a short discussion.<br>
Figs. 5A-5D show results for the following SR proteins: Calsequestrin, phospholamban, SERCA-2a (Calcium ATPase) and ryanodine receptors; the following Pump Proteins: Sodium-Calcium Exchanger; the following Transcription Factors: GATA-4; and the following Cytokines: Interleukin-6.<br>
In general, these seven proteins moved directionally the same as their mRNA expression. Phospholamban showed complete normalization as did SERCA-2a.<br>
These results are consistent with the concept that the CCM acute and chronic effect is mediated by favorable modification of calcium cycling within the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br>
Also notable is that under chronic condition, the CCM signals appear to normalize the over-expression of the sodium-calcium exchanger.<br>
Re Fig. 5A:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Figs. 5E-5H show results for GAPDH (Housekeeping), transcription factor GATA-1 which did not change, matrix metalloproteinase-9 which changes consistent with mRNA expression and cytoskeletal protein Tubulin-beta which also changes consistent with what is shown for mRNA expression. GATA-1 is shown in comparison with GATA-4-<br>
Re Fig.5E<br><br><br><br><br>
Figs. 5I-5L show results from the proteins matrix-metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), cytoskeletal proteins tubulin alpha and titin, tissue inhibitor of matrix-metaIloproteinase-1 (TIMP-I) and cell surface protein integrm-alpha-5.<br>
There were no apparent changes in TMP-l. CCM therapy also had no significant effect on integrin-alpha-5. It should be noted that integrin-alpha-5 can be affected by other means, such as mechanically constraining the heart (e.g., thus directly affecting its transduction function).<br>
CCM therapy, however, significantly down-regulated MMP-1, tubulin-alpha and titm which is consistent with the observation with respect to the effects of CCM on mRNA expression of these genes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Figs. 5M-5P show results from the proteins TNF-a (showed in comparison to IL-6), p21ras, p38 MAPK, TIMP-2 (showed in comparison to TIMP-1 and pl-AR.<br>
The lack of change in TIMP-2 is consistent with previous observations. Long-term CCM therapy significantly reduced protein expression of the cytokine TNF- a and significantly reduced the expression of the stretch proteins p2Iras as well as p38 MAPK. This is consistent with the observation that CCM therapy attenuates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Also to be noted is up-regulation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, which is favorable,<br>

Comparison of mRNA levels and protein levels in the LV free wall on chronic treated<br>
dogs<br>
Referring back to the 14 dogs tested for chronic effects, mRNA expression in LV free wall of the housekeeping gene GAPDH and CSQ, the fetal program genes consisting of β-AR, αMHC, ANP, and BNP and the cardiac SR genes SERCA-2a, PLB, and RyR are shown in table 5 quantified in densitometric units. Expression of GAPDH and CSQ was unchanged among the 3 study groups namely, normal dogs, sham-operated HF dogs and HF CMM-treated dogs. mRNA expression of β1-AR, aMHC, SERCA-2a5 PLB and RyR decreased mid expression of ANP and BNP increased significantly in sham-operated HF dogs compared to normal. Three months of CCM therapy restored the expression of all genes to near normal levels. Protein expression in the LV free wall of CSQ, β1-AR, ANP, BNP SERCA-2a, PLB and RyR are also shown in Table 5 quantified in densitometric units. Protein levels of CSQ were unchanged among the 3 study groups. Protein levels of Pi-AR, SERCA-2a, PLB and RyR decreased and that of ANP and BNP increased significantly in sham-operated HF dogs compared to normal dogs. Long-term CCM therapy restored the expression of all measured proteins except PLB to near normal levels (Table 5). Possibly, phospholamban was not restored because of the differential phosphorylation thereof. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, this mechanism is used to selectively increase synthesis of some proteins over others.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, this mechanism is used to test if a patient is getting better - by stopping a therapy which is directly causing phospohorylation and seeing if phospholamban levels normalize (or trend to) after a few days and/or if other protein levels trend towards disease state values.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, relaxation time between signal application is an integral part of therapy. In one example, relaxation time is used to allow the cell to find a new balance between the expressed proteins that are not on corresponding levels, such a balance may include protein levels (or mRNA levels or phosphorylation or structural remodeling) degrading and/or protein levels improving. Such relation times may be on order of seconds, minutes hours or days, depending on which mechanism are to be allowed to take part (e.g., protem based, etc.).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, when<br>
a applymg phosphorylation-modifying therapy as described herein, a process of weaning is applied. Possibly, if treatment is stopped suddenly, phospholamban levels will be too low to support suitable cardiac activity, possibly causing a downwards-spiral in patient health. In an exemplary embodiment of the<br><br>
invention, as protein levels normalize (for other proteins), therapy is reduced to allow phospholamban recovery. Optionally, the pauses are timed according to measured recovery in phospholamban levels.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, electrical therapy is applied selectively to tissue measured as having reduced phospholamban levels and/or phosphoylation levels, so as not to potentially damage healthy tissue. In some cases, changes to "healthy" tissue is desirable. For example, increasing phosphorylation and thus possibly reducing phospholamban may be desirable if long term reduction in contractility is desired. In another example, phosphorylation may be increased in normal tissue in order to cause over (or under) expression of some proteins, such as gap junction proteins or mechanical proteins. It should be appreciated that a therapy target of diseased tissue need not be a mirror of a healthy tissue state.<br>

Local and remote effects<br>
The above results showed analysis of tissue samples at the treated site. Fig. 6 shows mRNA expression levels for Phospholamban, SERCA-2a and Ryanodine receptors, showing chronic improvement in septal tissue to which a field was applied chronically.<br>
Referring to the 14 dogs chronic study described above, the restoration to near normal levels of the fetal program and most SR proteins after 3 months of CCM therapy was the same in LV tissue obtained from the inter-ventricular septum, the site nearest to the CCM signal delivery leads, and the LV free wall, a site remote from the CCM leads. A typical example illustrating the changes in protein levels of CSQ, SERCA-2a, PLB and RyR between the two LV sites is shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 8 shows phosphorylation levels in chronically treated dogs, at the application location in the septum.<br>
In addition to examining protein expression of fetal program genes and SR proteins, protein levels of P-PLB at serine-16 and threonine-17 were also examined. Measurements were made in tissue obtained from both the inter-ventricular septum and the LV free wall. At both sites, protein levels of P-PLB at serine-16 and threonine-17 were significantly lower in sham-operated HF dogs compared to normal dogs and returned to near normal levels after 3 months of CCM therapy (Fig. 11, Table 6). In both the inter-ventricular septum and LV free wall, the ratio of P-PLB at serine-16 to total PLB and the ratio of P-PLB at threnonine-17 were also significantly lower in sham-operated HF dogs compared to normal dogs (Table 6). Long-term CCM therapy resulted in a significant increase of both ratios in both the interventricular Septum and the LV free wall (Table 6).<br>

Fig. 7A and 7B shows mRNA expression at sites remote from the application of the signal, but still within the left ventricle at a relatively short time of four hours apparently no significant effect (mRNA, protein and/or phosphorylation) is shown. This may indicate that the effect of the CCM signal is first local, for example on a molecular level and then propagates to remote location, for example by biochemical signaling or by a mechanical signaling indicated by the change in contraction behavior of the treated tissue and/or of the chamber as a whole. The following non-limiting mechanism is suggested; the electric field causes phosphorylation of phospholamban. This in turn increases the activity/affinity of SRBCA-2a for calcium and immediately improves SR calcium cycling. GATA-4 and the sodium calcium exchanger may play an additive role in the improved function. As LV function begins to improve and the LV gets smaller, many of the molecular/biochemical maladaptations begin to correct, which adds to the long-term benefits. Improved SR cardiac cycling may be a goal of some therapies in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the mvention.<br><br>
In open chest HF dogs, acute hemodynamic and local/remote effects were determined. Continuous delivery of CCM therapy over the course of 2 hours improved LV systolic function and associated hemodynamics. Compared to baseline before initiating CCM therapy, 2 hours of CCM therapy resulted in a significant increase of LV ejection fraction (31 ± 2 vs. 26 ± 1%, p
LV tissue obtained near the site of CCM lead implants, was compared to LV tissue obtained from a site remote from the CCM leads. LV tissue samples obtained from the same sites from dogs with HF that were untreated and normal dogs were used for comparisons. Compared to untreated HF dogs, the ratio of P-PLB to total PLB increased significantly in CCM-treated HF dogs compared to untreated HF dogs in the LV anterior wall at the site of signal delivery (Fig. 12A), whereas it was essentially unchanged in the LV posterior wall remote from the site of CCM signal delivery (Fig. 12B).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the location to which electrification will be applied is selected based on a model of what areas will cause a biochemical or mechanical cascade in the heart and improve its function. Optionally, the size of areas is optimized to reduce power needs, while retain an expected time frame of treatment.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an area to be treated is selected based on immediate response of tissue therein to electrical stimulation.<br>
One example of a mechanical cascade is a desired change in stretching of tissue which will, as that tissue improve, propagate. Another example of mechanical cascade is selecting sufficient and correct tissue m the ventricle such that immediate hemodynamic effects (e.g., improvement) are seen and sensed by the rest of the chamber.<br>
A possible mechanism of non-mechanical propagation (which may be utilized) is that healthy cells can help regulate ionic concentrations of neighboring cells via gap junctions between them. Alternatively or additionally, other communication may occur via the gap junctions.<br>
Another possible mechanism is that low level fields reach further and take longer to have an effect. This suggests that low-level fields m general may be used, with a rapidity of effect depending on the field strength and/or mechanical or other improvement of parts of the heart.<br>
In some embodiments of the mvention, the efficacy of a treatment is measured by tracking remote effects alternatively or additionally, to tracking local effects. One or more of<br><br>
the following logics may be used: 1. There is more remote tissue to sample, with less danger of damage to heart, 2. The effect in remote tissue is more gradual and thus easier to track. 3. Acute effects may not occur (or be smaller) in remote tissue, thereby preventing the masking of longest term effects by acute effects. Optionally, for local or remote measurement, the measurement is made when no treatment is applied. An example of an acute effect which may mask a longer term effect is conduction velocity.<br>

Additional proteins<br>
Experimental results of the effect of CCM signals on other proteins is described below. Effect of CCM on calcium cycling in tlie sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or S100Al protein.<br>
Overexpression of the calcium-binding protein SlOOAl in failing rat cardiomyocytes normalizes sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling by increasing calcium-uptake and reducing SR calcium-leak from ryanodine channels. Expression of S100Al is significantly decreased in left ventricular (LV) myocardium of explanted failed human hearts.<br>
RNA was extracted and homogenate prepared from LV tissue obtained from 6 CCM-treated HF dogs, 6 untreated HF dogs and 6 normal (ML) dogs (these are the same dogs as above). S100Al mRNA expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression was measured using Western blotting. Bands obtained after gel electrophoresis were quantified in densitometric units (du).<br>
S100Al mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly in untreated HF dogs compared to NL dogs. Chronic CCM therapy significantly increased mRNA and protem<br><br>
expression of SlOOAl. Restoration of expression of this calcium binding protein improves calcium cycling within the SR and may account at least in part, for the observed improvement of LV function seen following chronic CCM therapy.<br><br>
Effect on Sorcin; Presenilin and Calstabin<br>
KNA was extracted and homogenate prepared from LV tissue obtained from 6 CCM-treated HF dogs, 6 untreated HF dogs and 6 normal (NL) dogs. These are the same dogs as in the previous section. Sorcin, Presenilin and Calstabin mRNA expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression was measured using Western blotting. Bands obtained after gel electrophoresis were quantified in densitometric units (du).<br>
Sorcin mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly in untreated HF dogs compared to NL dogs. Chronic CCM therapy significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of Sorcin, Presenilin-2 increased in HF and decreased with CCM. Preseilin-1 was measured as an internal control and it did not change. This suggests that Presenilin-2 can be used as a target (e.g., treatment goal) for treating HF and as an indicator for diagnosis and modification of treatment.<br>
Restoration of expression of Sorcin may prevent or limit the RyR2 calcium leak and in doing so improve calcium cycling within the SR. Correction of this maladaptation by CCM therapy may account, at least in part, for the observed improvement of LV function. In particular, the combined correction of Sorcin and Presenilm, which interact to regulate cardiac ryanodine calcium release channels may act as a mediator of recovery of calcium overload in cardiomyocytes due to "RyR-2 calcium leak" in heart failure.<br>
It should be noted that Calstabin-2 decreased in heart Mure but remained depressed even after 3 months of CCM therapy. This suggests that CCM does not act by merely resetting cellular fraction, however, as noted above, resetting may be part of the process. One possible explanation is that Castabin-2 does not rebound as it is tied to phospholamban levels. Another possible explanation is that Castabin-2 indicates a path for the progression of heart failure. Until the underlying cause is removed, it may remain depressed. Possibly, an impi-ovement over significantly longer periods of time is to be expected. In an exemplary embodiment of the<br><br>
invention, this is used to estimate the ability of a patient to stop therapy. For example, if Castabin-2 levels trend to or do normalize, this can indicate that the tissue state is not diseased or becoming healthier. Optionally, this allows tracking of tissue improvement even during ongoing electrical therapy. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, signal optimization techniques as described herein are used to find and then apply a signal specific (or more specific) to modifying Castabin-2.<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 13-15 and in the tables below (in densitometric units).<br>
Figs. 13A and 13B present mRNA (Fig. 13A) and protein blots (Fig. 13B) illustrating expression of Sorcin in LV tissue of HF Dogs treated with CCM for 3 months according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
