PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF HMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORY MEVALONIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, to process steps, to novel intermediates and to novel catalysts.<br>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also called p-hydroxy-p-methyiglutaryl-co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors and also called statins) are understood to be those active agents which may be preferably used to lower the lipid levels including cholesterol in blood and can be used e.g. for the prevention or treatment of hyperlipidemia and artheriosclerosis.<br>
The class of HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors comprises compounds having differing structural features. For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting of atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin (formerly itavastatin), pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, or, in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Preferred HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors are those agents which have been marketed, most preferred is fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, especially the Calcium salt thereof, or simvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Atorvastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,273,995. Cerivastatin of formula<br><br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,177,080. (+)-(5S,3R)-Form of fluvastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,345,772. Lovastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 4,231,938. Pitavastatin of formula<br><br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,856,336. Pravastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 4,410,629. Rosuvastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,260,440. Simvastatin of formula<br><br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 4,444,784.<br>
The structure of the active agents identified hereinbefore or hereinafter by generic or tradenames may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International or LifeCycle Patents International, respectively, (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active agents and, based on these references, and is likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Acidic representatives of HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors have been launched are being developed as salts, for example, fluvastatin as sodium salt and pitavastatin as calcium salt.<br>
The corresponding active ingredients or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be used in form of a solvate, such as a hydrate or including other solvents, used for crystallization.<br>
Essentially, statins comprise a cyclic core element and a side chain element of formula<br><br>
(a 3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid moiety) that might form a corresponding lactone partial structure of formula<br><br><br>
(a 3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid derivative) that might form a corresponding lactone partial<br>
structure of formula <br>
In said side chain elements (A) or (C), respectively, the 3,5-syn diol structure and the R-configuration at C-3 are essential features, as corresponding statins with this specific element exhibit the highest biological activity.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an enantioselective synthesis of compounds of formula (I) resulting in high yields and moreover guaranteeing a minimization of the ecological pollution of the environment, being economically attractive, e.g. by using less reaction steps in the reaction sequence for the manufacture of compounds of formula I, and leading to largely enantiomerically pure target products and to products of high crystallisability. Furthermore, another objective of the present invention is to provide a process that can be carried out in a larger scale and can thus be used for a corresponding production process. Furthermore, there is a need to avoid any separation of any stereoisomers.<br>
Surprisingly, the process of the present invention clearly meets the above objectives. The process relates to an enantioselective synthesis by using essentially the so-called transfer hydrogenation approach. For example, an enantiomer excess (ee) of a compound of formula (I) of &gt; 95%, preferably £ 98% and most preferably £ 99% can be achieved.<br><br>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory mevalonic acid derivative of formula (I a)<br><br>
or a salt, especially a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt with a base, thereof or a lactone thereof wherein<br><br>
A salt of a compound of formula (I) is, for example, a salt with a base, preferably a corresponding pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A lactone of a compound of formula (I) is represented by formulae (I a) and (I b)<br><br>
Corresponding cyclic residue R comprises a cyclic residue selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br>
Extensive experimental evaluations surprisingly resulted in a process sequence for the manufacture that meets the above criteria showing the indicated advantages.<br>
The process as disclosed in Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 9 (1999) 2977-2982 for the manufacture of pitavastatin (NK 104) requires the formation of a racemic erythro-(3,5-dihydroxyester that is hydrolysed to form the corresponding acid. With a-methylbenzylamine a diastereomeric mixture of resulting salts are formed that need to be resolved into the different diastereomeric salts. The clear disadvantage of this approach is that half of the material needs to be distroyed. Accordingly, the process of the present invention can be carried out without such a diastereomeric resolution procedure.<br><br>
The process for the manufacture of a compound of formula<br><br>
or a salt thereof or a lactone thereof, wherein the element	represents -CH2-CH2- or -<br>

It is known from the art that asymmetric transfer hydrogenation using a Ru (II) catalyst (esp. a Noyori catalyst) is carried out in the absence of water and under inert gas conditions. Surprisingly, the transfer hydrogenation step according to the present invention can be run in a water containing solvent system and in the absence of an inert gas. This means that the reaction is successful even though the solvent used comprised water (e.g. 3 % by Karl-Fischer).<br>
Furthermore, the compound of formula (II c) could - in view of the esterified carboxy group -be a ligand of the Ru (II) catalyst as well. Surprisingly, it has been proven that a compound of formula (II c) does not form a ligand to the Ru catalyst.<br><br>
It is known that quinoline moieties are desactivating the hydrogenation catalysts. Especially, in case of the manufacture of compound of (I) being pravastatin, the person skilled in the art would expect that the quinoline group desactivates the Ru catalyst. Surprisingly, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation step according to the present invention is successfully carried out without that the catalyst of formulae (II d), (II d'), (II d"), (lid'"), (lid""), (lid""'), (lid""") or (lid""'") is being desactivated.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to reaction step (b), especially when using a Ru(ll) catalyst of formulae (II d), (II <f or d respectively.></f><br>

The conversion of an acid of formula (I) into a salt is carried out in a manner known per se.<br>
Thus, for example, a salt with a base of compounds of the formula I is obtained by treating with a base. Salts can be converted into the free compounds in a customary manner, and salts with a base can be converted, for example, by treating with a suitable acid agent to the free acid.<br>
The conversion of an acid of formula (I) into a corresponding lactone of formula (I a) or (I b), respectively, is carried out in the presence of an acid, preferably a mineral acid, in a suitable, e.g. protic or aproctic, solvent, such as ethanol or acetonitrile. Depending on the acid, the conversion is carried out in a temperature range, for example, from -78° to the boiling point of the solvent. Most preferably, H3P04 in acetonitrile at 60°C is used.<br>
The conversion of a lactone of formula (I a) or (I b), respectively, into a salt of the acid of formula (I) is carried out, for example, in a mixture of a protic solvent, e.g. ethanol, and water, by using an alkalimetall hydroxide, such as LiOH, NaOH or Ca(OH)2. Alternatively, the lactone can be hydrolysed by using an alkalimetall hydroxide, such as LiOH, NaOH and<br><br>
the resulting salt can be converted into the calcium salt of the acid of pravastatin by addition of an aqueous solution of CaCI2 in water.<br>
A variant to the process according to the present invention comprises the direct formation of. a lactone of a compound of formula (I). The formation of said lactone can be carried out by treating a compound of formula (I) or (II h) with an acid, such as a mineral acid, preferable with H3PO4.<br>
The conversion of a resulting compound of formula (I) wherein the element<br>
represents -CH=CH- into a compound of formula (I) wherein the element	represents<br>
-CH2-CH2- is carried out by selectively hydrogenating the double bond -CH=CH-, especially with an appropriate reduction agent, for example, by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, for example, a Ruthenium catalyst, such as (Ru(cod)(nu-3-(2-methylally))2, by reduction with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst or with a hydride, for example, a hydride which, if desired, may be complex, such as a hydride formed from an element of the 1st and 3rd main groups of the periodic table of the elements, for example borohydride or aluminohydride, for example lithium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, diisobutylaluminium hydride (an additional reduction step using alkali metal cyanoborohydride, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, may be necessary), and also diborane.<br>
Instead of converting a resulting compound of formula (I) wherein the element<br>
represents -CH=CH- into a compound of formula (I) wherein the element	represents<br>
-CH2-CH2-, the hydrogenation of the double bond -CH=CH- can be effected, with compounds of formulae (II e), (II g) or (II h), respectively, e.g. in addition to reaction steps (c), (d) or (e), respectively.<br>
