				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the carbonylation of a reactant selected from an alkyl alcohol, a reactive derivative thereof or a mixture of an alkyl alcohol and a reactive derivative thereof in the presence of an iridium catalyst.<br>
Carbonylation processes in the presence of iridium catalysts are known and are described, for example, in US 3772380, European patent publication number EP 0618184-A, UK patents GB 1276326m GB 1234641 and GB 1234642.<br>
Carbonylation in the presence of an iridium catalyst and co-promoter selected from ruthenium and osmium is described in European patent publication number EP-0643034-A.<br>
It has now been found that a promoter selected from the group consisting of cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium and tungsten has a beneficial effect on the rate of carbonylation of an alkyl alcohol and/or a reactive derivative thereof in the presence of an iridium catalyst.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of a carboxylic acid by carbonylation of an alkyl alcohol and/ or a reactive derivative thereof which process comprises contacting in a carbonylation reactor said alcohol and/or a reactive derivative thereof with carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction composition comprising (a) an iridium catalyst, (b) an alkyl<br>
halide, (c) at least a finite concentration of water, and (d) a promoter selected from the group consisting of cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium and tungsten.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the carbonylation of a reactant selected from an alkyl alcohol, a reactive derivative thereof or a mixture of an alkyl alcohol and a reactive derivative thereof which process comprises contacting in a carbonylation reactor said alcohol and/or a reactive derivative thereof with carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction composition comprising: (a) an iridium catalyst, (b) an alkyl halide, (c) at least a finite concentration of water, (d) a promoter selected from the group consisting of cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium and tungsten and (e) optionally a co-promoter selected from ruthenium, osmium and rhenium to produce carboxylic acid and/or an ester of a carboxylic acid.<br>
Also according to the present invention there is provided a catalyst system for the carbonylation of an alkyl alcohol and/ or a reactive derivative thereof which catalyst system comprises (a) an iridium catalyst, (b) an alkyl halide and (c) a promoter selected from the group consisting of cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium and tungsten.<br>
The promoters of the present invention are not only generally cheaper than promoters such as ruthenium and osmium, but at least cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium and indium are believed to be less likely to form volatile species in the carbonylation reaction.<br>
Suitable alkyl alcohols comprise C1 to C10, preferably C1 to C6, more preferably C1 to C4 alkyl alcohols and yet more preferably methanol. Preferably, the alkyl alcohol is a primary or secondary alkyl alcohol. The product of the carbonylation of an alcohol having n carbon atoms and/or a derivative thereof is a carboxylic acid having n+1 carbon atoms and/or an ester of a carboxylic acid having n+1 carbon atoms and the alcohol having n carbon atoms. Thus the product of the carbonylation of methanol and/or a derivative thereof is acetic acid and/or methyl acetate.<br>
Suitable reactive derivatives of the alkyl alcohol include the corresponding alkyl ester of the alcohol and the corresponding carboxylic acid product, dialkyl ethers and alkyl halides, preferably iodides or bromides.  Suitable reactive derivatives of methanol include methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and methyl iodide. A mixture of alkyl alcohol and reactive derivatives thereof may be used as reactants in the process of the present invention. Preferably, methanol and/or methyl acetate are used as reactants.  At least some of the alkyl alcohol and/or reactive derivative thereof will be converted to, and hence present as, alkyl esters in the liquid reaction composition by reaction with carboxylic acid product or solvent. The concentration in the liquid reaction composition, of alkyl ester is suitably in the range 1 to 70% by weight, preferably 2 to 50% by weight and yet more preferably 3 to 35%&gt; by weight.<br>
Water may be formed in situ in the liquid reaction composition, for example, by the esterification reaction between alkyl alcohol reactant and carboxylic acid product. Water may be introduced to the carbonylation reactor together with or separately from other components of the liquid reaction composition. Water may be separated from other components of reaction composition withdrawn from the reactor and may be recycled in controlled amounts to maintain the required concentration of water in the liquid reaction composition.  Suitably, the concentration of water in the liquid reaction composition is in the range 1 to 15% by weight, preferably 1 to 10% by weight, more preferably no greater than 6.5% by weight.<br>
The iridium component of the catalyst in the liquid reaction composition<br>

Particularly preferred is green iridium acetate which may be used in an acetic acid or aqueous acetic acid solution.<br>
Preferably, the iridium catalyst concentration in the liquid reaction composition is in the range 100 to 6000 ppm by weight of iridium.<br>
The cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium or tungsten promoter may comprise any cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium or tungsten containing compound which is soluble in the liquid reaction composition.

Examples of suitable indium-containing compounds which may be used include indium acetylacetonate, indium acetate, InCl3, InBr3, Inl3, Inl and In(OH)3.<br>
Examples of suitable tungsten-containing compounds which may be used<br>
include W(CO)6, WC14, WC16, WBr5, WI2, C9H12 W(CO)3 and any tungsten chloro-, bromo- or iodo-carbonyl compound.<br>
The molar ratio of each promoter : iridium catalyst is suitably in the range (0.1 to 20): 1, preferably (0.5 to 10): 1. More than one promoter may be used.<br>
An optional co-promoter selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, osmium and rhenium may also be used and may comprise any ruthenium, osmium or rhenium containing compound which is soluble in the liquid reaction composition. The optional co-promoter may be added to the liquid reaction composition for the carbonylation reaction in any suitable form which dissolves in the liquid reaction composition or is convertible to a soluble form.<br>
Examples of suitable ruthenium-containing compounds which may be used as optional co-promoter include ruthenium (III) chloride, ruthenium (III) chloride trihydrate, ruthenium (IV) chloride, ruthenium (III) bromide, ruthenium metal, ruthenium oxides, ruthenium (III) formate, [Ru(CO)3I3]"H+, [Ru(CO)2I2In, [Ru(CO)4I2], [Ru(CO)3I2]2, tetra(aceto)chlororuthenium(II,III), ruthenium (III) acetate, ruthenium (III) propionate, ruthenium (III) butyrate, ruthenium pentacarbonyl, trirutheniumdodecacarbonyl and mixed ruthenium halocarbonyls such as dichlorotricarbonylruthenium (II) dimer, dibromotricarbonylruthenium (II) dimer, and other organoruthenium complexes such as tetrachlorobis(4-cymene)diruthenium(II), tetrachlorobis(benzene)diruthenium(II), dichloro(cycloocta-l,5-diene)ruthenium (II) polymer and tri s(acetylacetonate)ruthenium (III).<br>

Examples of suitable rhenium-containing compounds which may be used as optional co-promoter include Re2(CO)10, Re(CO)5Cl, Re(CO)5Br, Re(CO)5i, ReCl3.xH20, [Re(CO)4I]2, [Re(CO)4I2]-H+ and ReCl5.yH2O.<br>
The molar ratio of each optional co-promoter : iridium catalyst is suitably in the range (0.1 to 20): 1, preferably (0.5 to 10): 1.<br>
Preferably, the iridium, promoter and optional co-promoter containing compounds are free of impurities which provide or generate in situ ionic iodides<br>
which may inhibit the reaction, for example, alkali or alkaline earth metal or other metal salts.<br>
Ionic contaminants such as, for example, (a) corrosion metals, particularly nickel, iron and chromium and (b) phosphines or nitrogen containing compounds or ligands which may quaternise in situ; should be kept to a minimum in the liquid reaction composition as these will have an adverse effect on the reaction by generating I" in the liquid reaction composition which has an adverse effect on the reaction rate. Some corrosion metal contaminants such as for example molybdenum have been found to be less susceptible to the generation of I". Corrosion metals which have an adverse affect on the reaction rate may be minimised by using suitable corrosion resistant materials of construction.  Similarly, contaminants such as alkali metal iodides, for example lithium iodide, should be kept to a minimum. Corrosion metal and other ionic impurities may be reduced by the use of a suitable ion exchange resin bed to treat the reaction composition, or preferably a catalyst recycle stream.  Such a corrosion metal removal process is described in US 4007130. Preferably, ionic contaminants are kept below a concentration at which they would generate 500 ppm I", preferably less than 250 ppm I" in the liquid reaction composition.<br>
Suitable alkyl halides have alkyl moieties corresponding to the alkyl moiety of the alkyl alcohol reactant and are preferably C1 to C10, more preferably C1 to C6 and yet more preferably C1 to C4 alkyl halides. Preferably the alkyl halide is an iodide or bromide, more preferably an iodide. A preferred alkyl halide is methyl iodide. Preferably, the concentration of alkyl halide in the liquid reaction composition is in the range 1 to 20%, preferably 2 to 16% by weight.<br>
The carbon monoxide reactant may be essentially pure or may contain inert impurities such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, noble gases, water and C1 to C4 paraffinic hydrocarbons. The presence of hydrogen in the carbon monoxide and generated in situ by the water gas shift reaction is preferably kept low, for example, less than 1 bar partial pressure, as its presence may result in the formation of hydrogenation products.  The partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the reaction is suitably in the range 1 to 70 bar, preferably 1 to 35 bar, more preferably 1 to 15 bar.<br>
The total pressure of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 10 to 200 barg, preferably 10 to 100 barg, more preferably 15 to 50 barg. The temperature of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 100 to 300 °C,<br>
preferably in the range 150 to 220 °C.<br>
Carboxylic acid and/or ester thereof may be used as a solvent for the reaction.<br>
The process of the present invention may be performed as a batch or a continuous process, preferably as a continuous process.<br>
The carboxylic acid and/or ester thereof product may be removed from the reactor by withdrawing liquid reaction composition and separating the carboxylic acid product and/or ester therof by one or more flash and/or fractional distillation stages from the other components of the liquid reaction composition such as iridium catalyst, cadmium, mercury, zinc, gallium, indium or tungsten promoter, optional co-promoter, alkyl halide, water and unconsumed reactants which may be recycled to the reactor to maintain their concentrations in the liquid reaction composition. The carboxylic acid product and/or ester thereof may also be removed as a vapour from the reactor.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by way of example only by reference to the following examples. Cadmium, mercury and zinc promoters<br>
A 150 cm3 Hastelloy B2 (Trade Mark) autoclave equipped with a Magnedrive (Trade Mark) stirrer, liquid injection facility and cooling coils was used for a series of batch carbonylation experiments. A gas supply to the autoclave was provided from a ballast vessel, feed gas being provided to maintain the autoclave at a constant pressure. The rate of gas uptake at a certain point in a experiment was used to calculate the carbonylation rate, as number of moles of reactant consumed per litre of cold degassed reactor composition per hour (mol/l/hr), at a particular reactor composition (reactor composition based on a cold degassed volume).<br>
The methyl acetate concentration was calculated during the course of the reaction from the starting composition, assuming that one mole of methyl acetate is consumed for every mole of carbon monoxide that is consumed. No allowance was made for organic components in the autoclave headspace. The data are reported at calculated methyl acetate concentrations of 26%, 15% and 6% which correspond to typical standing concentrations in the liquid reaction composition in a continuous process. For 15% calculated methyl acetate concentration in such a continuous process the concentration of other components of such a liquid reaction composition are: methyl iodide about 5 to 8%, typically about 5 to 6%, water<br>
about 6 to 8% and acetic acid balance.<br>
For each batch carbonylation experiment the autoclave was charged with cadmium, mercury or zinc promoter, optional co-promoter and the liquid components of the liquid reaction composition excluding part of the water charge (6.5 g), in which the iridium catalyst was dissolved (see Table 1).<br>
The autoclave was flushed twice with nitrogen and once with carbon monoxide (being pressurised with each gas to approximately 25 barg) and was then heated, by means of electrical heating coils, to a temperature of 190°C under 1 bara pressure of carbon monoxide. A rapid and consistent rate of stirring (1000 rpm) was employed. Once stable at temperature the aqueous iridium catalyst solution was injected into the autoclave.  Simultaneously, the autoclave was pressurised to 22 barg with carbon monoxide fed from the ballast vessel. The pressure in the autoclave was subsequently maintained at approximately 22 barg (see Table 2) with carbon monoxide fed from the ballast vessel. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide was not measured but was believed to be less than 15 bar. The reaction temperature was maintained within ± 1 °C of the desired reaction temperature (190 °C).<br>
Gas uptake from the ballast vessel was measured throughout the course of the experiment and used to calculate carbonylation rate. After uptake of carbon monoxide from the ballast vessel has ceased the autoclave was isolated from the gas supply and was cooled to room temperature by means of the cooling coils. The autoclave was vented and samples of the liquid reaction composition and gases in the headspace of the autoclave were analysed by gas chromatography. The major product in each batch carbonylation experiment according to the present invention was acetic acid. By-product yields are collated in Table 2. Examples 1-10 and Experiments A-I<br>
The results given in Table 2 show that cadmium does not act as a carbonylation catalyst under the reaction conditions (Experiment D). The results in Table 2 also show that cadmium promotes iridium catalysed methanol carbonylation (compare Examples 1-3 with Experiments A-D). The results in Table 2 show that the carbonylation rate increases as the cadmium concentration increases.  The results in Table 2 show that mercury and zinc are also promoters for iridium catalysed carbonylation of methanol (Examples 4-7), but are not as effective as cadmium.<br>
The results in Table 2 also show that cadmium and zinc promote an<br><br>
indium/ruthenium carbonylation of methanol; (Experiment E compared with Examples 8, 9 and 10).<br>
No evidence of precipitation was observed in Examples 1 to 7 which indicates that cadmium, mercury and zinc are soluble.<br>

A 300 cm3 Hastelloy B2 (Trade Mark) autoclave equipped with a Dispersimax (Trade Mark) stirrer, liquid injection facility and cooling coils was used for a series of batch carbonylation experiments. A gas supply to the autoclave was provided from a ballast vessel, feed gas being provided to maintain the autoclave at a constant pressure. The rate of gas uptake at a certain point in a experiment was used to calculate the carbonylation rate, as number of moles of reactant consumed per litre of cold degassed reactor composition per hour (mol/l/hr), at a particular reactor composition (reactor composition based on a cold degassed volume).<br>
The methyl acetate concentration was calculated during the course of the reaction from the starting composition, assuming that one mole of methyl acetate is consumed for every mole of carbon monoxide that is consumed. No allowance was made for organic components in the autoclave headspace. The data are reported at a calculated methyl acetate concentration of 26, 15 and 6% which corresponds to a typical standing concentration in the liquid reaction composition in a continuous process. For a calculated concentration of methyl acetate of 15% the concentration of other components of such a liquid reaction composition are: methyl iodide about 5 to 8%, typically about 5 to 6%, water about 6 to 8% and acetic acid balance.<br>
For each batch carbonylation experiment the autoclave was charged with tungsten promoter, optional co-promoter and the liquid components of the liquid reaction composition excluding part of the water charge (10.83 g), in which the iridium catalyst was dissolved (see Table 5).<br>
The autoclave was flushed once with nitrogen to approximately 30 barg and twice with carbon monoxide to approximately 25 barg and was then heated, by means of electrical heating coils, to a temperature of 190°C under 8 barg pressure of carbon monoxide. A rapid and consistent rate of stirring (1500 rpm) was employed. Once stable at temperature, the aqueous iridium catalyst solution was injected into the autoclave.  Simultaneously, the autoclave was pressurised to 22 barg with carbon monoxide fed from the ballast vessel. The pressure in the autoclave was subsequently maintained at 22.0 barg with carbon monoxide fed from the ballast vessel. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide was calculated to be approximately 8 bar when the calculated methyl acetate concentration was 15 % by weight.  The reaction temperature was maintained within ±1 °C of the desired<br>
reaction temperature (190 °C).<br>
Gas uptake from the ballast vessel was measured throughout the course of the experiment and used to calculate carbonylation rate. After uptake of carbon monoxide from the ballast vessel has ceased the autoclave was isolated from the gas supply and was cooled. The autoclave was vented and samples of the liquid reaction composition were analysed by gas chromatography. The major product in each batch carbonylation experiment according to the present invention was acetic acid. By-product yields are collated in Table 6. Examples 15-21 and Experiments J-N<br>
In Examples 15-17 additonal methyl iodide (3 molar equivalents to tungsten) was added to compensate for probable loss of methyl iodide to tungsten iodocarbonyl components. Experiment M shows that simple addition of this extra methyl iodide to an un-promoted iridium reaction did not cause a significant increase in reaction rate.<br>
The results given in Table 6 show that tungsten promotes iridium catalysed methanol carbonylation (compare Examples 15-17 with Experiments J-L). Further Experiments<br>
Further experiments (Experiment N and Examples 18-21) were performed using the same 300ml autoclave apparatus as for tungsten. Examples 18 to 20 show the effect of increasing the amount of zinc promoters and Example 21 shows the effect of cadmium promoter.<br>
