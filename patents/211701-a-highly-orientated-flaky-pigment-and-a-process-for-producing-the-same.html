				<td>Highly orientated flaky pigment and a process for producing<br>
Technical Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a highly orientated flaky pigment(excellent<br>
in plane orientation (leafing effect). In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to a novel highly orientated flaky pigment excellent in plane<br>
orientation, which has been surface-treated with a fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound to improve the coloristic property and gloss of the<br>
flaky pearl pigment.<br>
Background Art<br>
A flaky pigment with a pearl gloss (referred to hereinafter as "flaky pearl<br>
pigment") is a pigment prepared by coating on the surface of a flaky base<br>
material with a transparent or semitransparent metal oxide having high<br>
refractive index such as titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide and iron oxide,<br>
showing a pearl gloss resulted from mutual interfering action between<br>
reflection of incident light from a flaky substrate/coating layer interface and<br>
reflection of incident light from the surface of the coating layer, and this<br>
pigment is widely used in various fields such as paints, inks, plastics and<br>
cosmetics. As the flaky pearl pigment itself is composed of inorganic<br>
materials as described above, it has quite high polarity and high<br>
hydrophilicity. Therefore, its lipophilicity is poor, and its affinity to an<br>
organic medium is lower. Accordingly, due to its poor dispersibility, there<br>
appears problem that the flaky pearl pigment cannot be used<br>
independently. Hence, in order to improve their weather resistance and<br>
anti-yellowing property according to different uses, surface treated flaky<br>
pearl pigments with various methods have been proposed (e.g. for paints,<br>
JP-A 63-130673, JP-A 1-292067 etc.; for plastics, JP-A 4-296371, JP-A<br>
5-171058, JP-A 9-48930 etc.).<br>
However, the majority of these known techniques are concerned basically<br>
with treatment for the purpose of improving the affinity of the flaky pearl<br>
pigment to mediums, and offer only improvement in dispersibility<br>
(wettability) in a medium such as inks, paints and plastics, the orientation<br>
of the flaky pearl pigment readily becomes random in the medium, so the<br>
original characteristics resulting from the shape of the flaky pearl pigment<br>
cannot be sufficiently demonstrated. That is, there was the problem that it<br>
was impossible to arrange the flaky particle planes of the flaky pearl<br>
pigments to parallel to a printed surface or a coated surface (this<br>
arrangement is referred to hereinafter as "plane orientation") in order to<br>
achieve the adequate original effect of the pigment on chroma and gloss.<br>
The probability of attaining plane orientation can be increased to a certain<br>
degree by improving or devising the method of printing or painting, but it is<br>
still insufficient to achieve the adequate effect. Accordingly, there is a great<br>
demand in the market for demonstration of the characteristics originated<br>
from the shape of the flaky pearl pigment (the improvement in coloristic<br>
property etc. by plane orientation is also referred hereinafter to as leafing<br>
effect). The technical problem with this demand is that itjs necessary for<br>
the flaky pearl pigment to maintain suitable affinity to prevent mutually<br>
aggregation of powdered particles in a medium constituting an ink, paint,<br>
plastic etc., and also simultaneously to float the pigment powdered<br>
particles on the surface of the medium without dispersing them into the<br>
inside of the medium, therefore the delicate balance is required for setting<br>
up this condition.<br>
On the other hand, phosphates having perfluoroalkyl groups (referred to<br>
hereinafter as fluorine-containing phosphate compounds) have been<br>
proposed as a treating agent for powder to render hydrophobicity and<br>
oleophobicity on cosmetics (JP-A 5-39209, JP-A 5-124932, JP-A 9-30935<br>
etc.), but they are not aimed directly at the leafing effect for the purpose of<br>
improving the characteristics of the flaky pigment. Furthermore, these prior<br>
art techniques make use of a method (a) where the fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound is dry-mixed directly with powder or a method (b)<br>
where the fluorine-containing phosphate compound is previously dissolved<br>
in a soluble solvent, and the resulting solution is dry-mixed with powder<br>
and dried, and therefore, these methods are aimed at mere physical<br>
adsorption but not at chemical adsorption, resulting in weak binding and<br>
inadequate duration and stability of the effect. In fact, there appears the<br>
problem that when such fluorine-containing ester compounds are added to<br>
inks, paints, plastics etc., their effect is not satisfactory, and the<br>
characteristics of the pigment at the initial stage are lowered through the<br>
operation of mixing with other medium components. Further, there existed<br>
another problem that because uniform adsorption is difficult in the dry.<br>
mixingjprocess, a long time is necessary for mixing and stirring, resulting in<br>
destruction of flaky base materials.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As a result of their eager investigation to improve the characteristics of the<br>
flaky pearl pigment, the present inventors found that upon treating the flaky<br>
pigment with a hydrated metal oxide and then surface-treating it.with a<br>
fluorine-containing phosphate compound, the flaky pearl pigment is<br>
endowed with excellent plane orientation to exhibit an excellent leafing<br>
effect as a pigment for inks, paints, plastics or cosmetics. on the basis of<br>
this finding, the present invention was made.<br>
That is, the present invention provides the novel highly orientated flaky<br>
pigment, the process for producing the same and the ink, paints, plastics<br>
and cosmetics comprising said pigment.<br>
1. A highly orientated flaky pigment being excellent in plane orientation,<br>
characterized in that a hydrated metal oxide and one or more<br>
phosphates selected from phosphates having perfluoroalkyl groups<br>
represented by the general formulae (A) and (B) shown in below or<br>
salts thereof are coated one after another on the surface of a flaky<br>
pigment with a pearl gloss, the general formulae:<br>
(A) (RfCnH2nO)mPO(OM)3-m<br><br>
(B) (RfSO2NRCnH2nO)mPO(OM)3-m<br>
wherein Rf is the same or different and represents linear or branched<br>
C3to C21 perfluoroalkyl group or perfluoroxyalkyl group, n is 1 to 12,<br>
mis 1 to 3, M represents hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium group or<br>
substituted ammonium group, and R represents hydrogen orC1 to C3<br>
alkyl group.<br>
2. The highly orientated flaky pigment according to item 1 above,<br>
characterized in that the metal component in the hydrated metal<br>
oxide comprises one or more metals selected from aluminium, zinc,<br>
calcium, magnesium, zirconium and cerium, and the amount thereof<br>
in terms of metal oxide is 0.1 to 20 % by weight relative to the flaky<br>
pearl pigment.<br>
3. The highly orientated flaky pigment according to item 1 or 2 above,<br>
characterized in that the amount of the phosphates having<br>
perfluoroalkyl groups represented by the general formula (A) or (B)<br>
shown in above or salts thereof is 0.1 to 20 % by weight relative to<br>
the flaky pearl pigment.<br>
4. A highly orientated flaky pigment characterized in that the highly<br>
orientated flaky pigment according to any one of item 1 to 3 is<br>
surface-treated Further with a polymer selected from cellulose<br>
compounds and poly(meth)acrylate compounds.<br>
5. A process for producing a highly orientated flaky pigment,<br>
characterized in that a flaky pigment is suspended in water, the pH of<br>
the suspension is adjusted to no less than the neutralization<br>
hydrolysis point of a metal salt, then an aqueous solution of one or<br>
more metal salts selected from aluminium, zinc, calcium, magnesium,<br>
zirconium and cerium is added to the suspension while keeping its<br>
pH constant with an aqueous alkali solution, and after addition, its pH<br>
is adjusted to no more than the pH at the neutralization hydrolysis<br>
point of the metals, an aqueous solution of phosphates having<br>
perfluoroalkyl groups represented by the general formula (A) or (B)<br>
shown in above or salts thereof is added to the resulting suspension<br>
under stirring, and after the addition, its suspension is filtered,<br>
washed with water and dried.<br>
6. Inks, paints, plastics or cosmetics containing the highly orientated<br>
flaky pigment according to any one of items 1 to 4 above.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more detail.<br>
The flaky pearl pigment used as the starting material in the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited, and usually its size is 500 urn or less in<br>
average, preferably 200 urn or less in average, and its thickness is 2 urn or<br>
less in average, preferably 1 urn or less in average, and for example, it is<br>
possible to use a pearl pigment obtained in a known coating method of a<br>
flaky base material such as natural mica, synthetic mica, graphite, alumina<br>
flake, silica flake, bismuth oxychloride or glass flake, with a transparent or<br>
semitransparent metal oxide having high refractive index. Specifically, the<br>
flaky pearl pigment can be obtained by coating the base material with a<br>
highly transparent or semitransparent metal oxide having high refractive<br>
index, such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide and zirconium oxide alone or in<br>
a mixture system or in the form of separate layers. As the process for<br>
producing the flaky pearl pigment, there is a method of coating the surface<br>
of a flaky base material in a suspension of the flaky base material with a<br>
hydrolyzate, by neutralization hydrolysis or heating hydrolysis, of a metal<br>
salt solution, followed by drying and calcining it, or a method of coating<br>
such metal alcoholate by a sol-gel method. Further, in the present<br>
invention, in the case of a flaky substrate of low polarity such as graphite,<br>
a flaky pearl pigment coated with a metal oxide after surface oxidation<br>
treatment (JP-A 4-320460, JP-A 4-348170 etc.), or a weather resistance<br>
pigment prepared by weather resistance-treating a flaky pearl pigment with<br>
Ce, Zr etc. (JP-A 1-292067 etc.) can also be used. The highly orientated<br>
flaky pigment of the present invention whose color tone (hue, chroma,<br>
luster) is based on the tone of the known flaky pearl pigment described in<br>
above, has further effectively improved said base color tone.<br>
The flaky pigments being excellent in plane orientation according to the<br>
present invention have a variety of the above-described known flaky pearl<br>
pigments coated with specific hydrated metal oxides. The "hydrated metal<br>
oxides" referred to in the present invention are those obtained by<br>
hdrolyzing metal salts, and for example, they mean metal hydroxides,<br>
hydrated oxides or mixtures thereof. Said hydrated metal oxides are<br>
presumed to act as a binder between the flaky pearl pigment as the<br>
starting material and a phosphate having perfluoroalkyl groups or a salt<br>
thereof (fluorine-containing phosphate compound) and also have the<br>
secondary effect of weather resistance. That is, the material forming the<br>
hydrated metal oxide is selected from metal species considered to form<br>
insoluble metal salt bonds with the fluorine-containing phosphate<br>
compounds represented by the general formula (A) or (B). The metal<br>
species constituting this hydrated metal oxide include metals such as<br>
aluminium, zinc, calcium, magnesium, zirconium and cerium or mixtures<br>
thereof. Among these metal species, aluminium, zinc, calcium and<br>
magnesium are preferably used. For the purpose of additionally improving<br>
weather resistance, metal species such as zirconium and cerium are<br>
particularly preferable. These hydrated metal oxides can be coated on the<br>
flaky pearl pigment by subjecting aqueous solutions of their corresponding<br>
metal salts such as chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, halides and oxy halides as<br>
the starting materials to alkali hydrolysis.<br>
The amount of the metal salt forming the hydrated metal oxide used in the<br>
present invention suffices insofar it can form a monolayer of the hydrated<br>
metal oxide on the surface of the flaky pearl pigment. Accordingly, if the<br>
specific surface area of the flaky pearl pigment is large, a large amount of<br>
the metal salt is necessary, whereas for a small specific surface area, a<br>
small amount suffices. Further, a large amount of the metal salt is<br>
unpreferable because this causes the change of in the color tone (hue,<br>
chroma, luster) of the flaky pearl pigment and further agglomeration of<br>
pigment particles occurs easily. Usually, the amount of the metal salt can<br>
be varied depending on the specific surface area of the flaky pearl<br>
pigment, and this amount can be determined in the range of 0.1 to 20 %<br>
by weight relative to the flaky pearl pigment. For example, when mica<br>
titanium (referring herein to a pigment having flaky mica covered with<br>
titanium dioxide) with an average particle size of about 12 µm is used, an<br>
amount of 10 % by weight or less, preferably an amount of 5 % by weight<br>
or less, is recommended.<br>
It can be considered that the hydrated metal oxide coated in this manner<br>
on the flaky pearl pigment is then exposed to pH lower than the<br>
neutralization hydrolysis point of the metal salt whereby in the reaction<br>
shown in the formulae a) to c), a hydroxy group binding to the metal on the<br>
surface is converted into a water molecule, and as a result, various metal<br>
cations such as hydroxy metal cations, oxymetal cations, hydrated metal<br>
cations are formed, and the fluorine-containing phosphate compound to be<br>
later on this site forms an insoluble metal salt bond and adsorbed thereon.<br>
M: n-valence metal<br>
a) M(OH)n + H+ -? [M(OH)n-i]+ + H2O<br>
(hydroxy metal cation)<br>
b) [M(OH)n-1]+ + H+? [M(OH)n-2]2+ + H2O or<br>
(hydroxy metal cation)<br>
[0=M(OH)n-4]2+ + H2O<br>
(oxymetal cation)<br>
c) [M(OH)]{n-1)+ + H+ ? Mn+ + H2O or [MH2=)]n+<br>
(metal cation) (hydrated metal cation)<br>
The fluorine-containing phosphate compound used in the prsent invention<br>
is a phosphate selected from phosphates having perfluoroalkyl groups<br>
represented by the general formulae (A) and (B) below or a salt thereof.<br>
The general formulae:<br>
(A) (RfCnH2nO)mPO(OM)3-m<br>
(B) (RfSO2NRCnH2nO)mPO(OM)3-m<br>
wherein Rf is the same or different and represents a linear or branched C3<br>
to C21 perfluoroalkyl group or perfluoroxyalkyl group, n is 1 to 12m is 1 to <br>
 3, M represents hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium group or substituted<br>
 "ammonium group, and R represents hydrogen or C1 to C3 alkyl group.<br>
Typical examples thereof include diheptadecafluorodecyl phosphoric acid<br>
[(C8F17C2H4O)2PO(OH)], heptadecafluorodecyl phosphoric acid<br>
[(C8F17C2H4O)PO(OH)2], a mixture thereof, bis[2-(N-propyl-N-perfIuoro-<br>
octane sulfonamide)ethyl] phosphoric acid<br>
[(C8F17SO2N(C3H7)C2H4O)2PO(OH)], alkali metal salts thereof, ammonium<br>
salts, and substituted ammonium salts (here, substituted ammonium salts<br>
mean alkanol amines such as monoethanol amine and diethanol amine as<br>
well as basic amino acids). In these salts, alkali metal salts, ammonium<br>
salts, monoethanol amine salts and diethanol amine salts are suitable at<br>
the point of water solubility, and in particular alkaline metal salts are<br>
preferable. If these salts are commercially available in the form of aqueous<br>
solutions, these can be used directly.<br>
The fluorine-containg phosphate compounds such as UNIDAN TG101<br>
(Daikin Industries, Ltd.), ZONYL-UR, ZONYL-FSP, ZONYL-FSE (DuPont),<br>
FTOP EF-123A, EF-123B (TOHKEM Products Co., Ltd.), MEGAFAC F-<br>
191 (Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc.), SURFLON S-12 (Asahi Glass<br>
Co., Ltd.) are commercially available. The amount of the fluorine-<br>
containing phosphate compound used is varied depending on the specific<br>
surface area of the flaky pearl pigment as the starting material, and its<br>
amount is in the range of 0.1 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 % by<br>
weight, and more preferably 1 to 5 % by weight. Its amount is selected<br>
such that a monolayer adsorption layer is formed at least on the surface. If<br>
this amount is too low, the so-called leafing effect cannot be obtained<br>
sufficiently. whereas if the amount is too large, double or more layers are<br>
formed and the desired leafing effect is lowered and further there is no<br>
economical benefit.<br>
FT-IR analysis of the binding state of the fluorine-containing phosphate<br>
compound in the highly orientated flaky pigment of the present invention<br>
reveals the disappearance of a broad and strong absorption (wavelength<br>
of 2700 to 2500 cm-1 and 2300 to 2100 cm-1) corresponding to -P-O-H,<br>
and TG/DTA analysis indicates that the pyrolysis temperature of the<br>
fluorine-containing phosphate compound is shifted to higher temperatures,<br>
and from these analysis results it is estimated that the fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound is adsorbed not via physical adsorption but via<br>
chemical bonding. .<br>
The highly orientated flaky pigment of the present invention may<br>
additionally be treated with various polymers depending on its use. This<br>
treatment is conducted in conformity to a different medium for each use in<br>
inks, paints, plastics and cosmetics to further improve the leafing effect.<br>
The polymers used here include e.g. celluloses such as cellulose nitrate,<br>
alkyl cellulose, hydroxy cellulose, hydroxyalkyl cellulose, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, and cellulose acetobutyrate, or poly(meth)acrylate and salts<br>
thereof, copolymers between maleic anhydride and various alkenes and<br>
salts thereof, for example, alkali hydrolysates of maleic anhydride-styrene<br>
copolymers and alkali hydrolysates of maleic anhydride-isobutylene. For<br>
use in plastics, plasticizers such as DOP (dioctyl phthalate) etc. can be<br>
used in this process alone or in combination with polymers.<br>
Now, the process for producing the highly orientated flaky pigment<br>
according to the present invention is described.<br>
First, an aqueous suspension of the flaky pearl pigment is prepared, and<br>
the pH of the suspension is adjusted using an acidic aqueous solution or<br>
an alkaline aqueous solution to a predetermined pH value of no less than<br>
the neutralization point of a metal salt (a salt of aluminium, calcium, zinc,<br>
magnesium, zirconium, or cerium, or a mixture of these salts). The pH<br>
value for this hydrolysis is varied depending on the type of a metal salt<br>
used in the present invention, and a pH value higher than the<br>
neutralization point pH is adopted. To the suspension under stirring is<br>
added a separately prepared solution of the salt, during of which the pH in<br>
the suspension is kept constant. After a predetermined amount of the salt<br>
is added, an acidic solution is used to lower the pH by about 0.2-3.0 from<br>
the hydrolysis neutralization point. It is presumed that by this pH<br>
adjustment, the above-described various metal cations are formed on the<br>
surface of the pigment. If this reduction in pH is 0.2 or less, the degree of<br>
formation of cations is reduced, and the described highly orientated flaky<br>
pigment is hardly obtained.<br>
On the other hand, if this reduction in pH is larger than 3.0, the hydrated<br>
metal oxide once coated is significantly eluted so the desired flaky pigment<br>
excellent in high orientation is hardly obtained in this case too. For<br>
example, if the aluminium salt (neutralization point is 5.2) is used, its<br>
hydrolysis is conducted at pH 5.8 to precipitate hydrated aluminium oxide,<br>
and then pH is reduced to 4.8 (the reduction range in pH from the<br>
neutralization point is 0.4). In the case of the magnesium salt<br>
(neutralization point is 12.4), its hydrolysis is conducted at pH 12.5, and<br>
the pH is lowered to e.g. 10.2 (the reduction range in pH from the<br>
neutralization point is 2.2) to form cations. In the case of the zinc salt<br>
(neutralization point is 8.0), its hydrolysis is conducted at pH 8.0 and the<br>
pH is lowered to e.g. 6.5 (the reduction range in pH from the neutralization<br>
point is 1.5). If the neutralization point pH is high, the pH can be greatly<br>
reduced in the range of 0.2 to 3.0.<br>
On one hand, the fluorine-containing phosphate compound is used after its<br>
aqueous solution is adjusted to predetermined pH and concentration. If the<br>
starting material is solids, its aqueous solution at a predetermined<br>
concentration is separately prepared after its pH is increased to no less<br>
than the water-solubility pH using an alkali solution. The aqueous solution<br>
thus obtained is added to the suspension of the flaky pearl pigment after<br>
pH adjustment. After addition, the pH of the suspension is further lowered<br>
(optionally) depending on the case. This is conducted in the direction of<br>
decreasing pH for the properties of the fluorine-containing phosphate,<br>
thereby strengthening metal bonds between the fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound and a metal cation on the surface of the coated<br>
hydrated metal oxide.<br>
Because the method of permitting the fluorine-containing phosphate<br>
compound to be adhere in a wet system (suspension) to the surface of the<br>
flaky pearl pigment coated with the hydrated metal oxide is adopted, the<br>
fluorine-containing phosphate compound can be allowed to adhere more<br>
uniformly to the surface than by the conventional dry-mixing process.<br>
Then, after the solution of the fluorine-containing phosphate compound<br>
was dropped, solids in the suspension are separated by filtration, and<br>
water-soluble materials adhering to the filtered cake are washed away with<br>
water and subjected to the drying step, thereby giving the highly orientated<br>
flaky pigment of the present invention. The drying temperature in this<br>
drying step is adopted a water-evaporating temperature which is lower<br>
than the decomposition temperature of the fluorine-containing phosphate<br>
compound, and a temperature of 110 to 150 °C is usually suitable in<br>
consideration of the drying rate.<br>
In the surface treatment with a polymer in the present invention, a usual<br>
dry-mixing process may be adopted. A device for dry mixing unit includes<br>
e.g. Henschel mixer, Waring blender, Super mixer, impeller mixer etc.<br>
Further, a spray-mixing method can also be adopted. In the surface<br>
treatment of the polymer used in the present invention, the polymer is<br>
previously dissolved in soluble solvents and if possible in highly evaporable<br>
solvents, for example water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate,<br>
methanol, toluene, cyclohexanone etc. and these may be dry-mixed or<br>
sprayed. In this stage, a plasticizer can also be used in combination<br>
particularly for use in plastics.<br>
The highly orientated flaky pigment of the present invention obtained in<br>
this manner can sufficiently demonstrate the leafing effect as the main<br>
object of the present invention upon incorporation into inks, paints, plastics<br>
or cosmetics, and in these mediums, formation of aggregates is not<br>
observed. Accordingly, the highly orientated flaky pigment of the present<br>
invention can be used effectively in inks for printing such as gravure<br>
printing, padding, offset printing etc., in various industrial paints,<br>
automobile paints, for printing and painting on the surface of paper and<br>
plastics, or mixed in plastics for improvement of coloration, or by virtue of<br>
its high orientation characteristics, it can also be used in a semitransparent<br>
reflection plate and a diffusion sheet in a liquid crystal display.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is further described in more detail by<br>
reference to the Examples and Comparative Examples, which however are<br>
not intended to limit the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
100g flaky pearl pigment (Iriodin® 223 with an average particle diameter of<br>
12 urn, Merck) was suspended in 2.0 I water and heated to about 75 °C<br>
under stirring. The pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 5.8 with 20<br>
weight-% aqueous hyrochloric acid solution. Then, 130 g aqueous<br>
aluminium chloride solution (concentration: 5.6 % by weight) was dropped<br>
to it while the pH was kept at 5.8 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution. After dropping, the pH was decreased to 4.8 with an<br>
aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and the mixture was stirred for 30<br>
minutes. Separately, 100 g water was added to a diethanolamine salt (10 g<br>
of 15 weight-% active ingredients in water) of a mixture of<br>
diheptadecafluorodecyl phosphoric acid [(C8F17C2H4O)2PO(OH)] and<br>
heptadecafluorodecyl phosphoric acid [(C8F17C2H4O)PO(OH)2] and then<br>
adjusted to pH 8 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. To<br>
this aqueous solution thus obtained was dropped to the above suspension<br>
while the suspension was kept at pH 4.8 with 20 weight-% aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution. After dropping, the pH value was further<br>
decreased to 4 with 20 weight-% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, and<br>
solids were separated by filtration from the resulting suspension, then<br>
washed and dried at 130 °C for 12 hours, to give the highly orientated flaky<br>
pigment. Measurement of this product by TG/DTA indicated that the<br>
amount of the fluorine-containing phosphate compound coated on the<br>
flaky pearl pigment was 1.5 % by weight of the pigment, and it was<br>
calculated that 99 % by weight of the charged fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound was coated on said pigment.<br>
Example 2<br>
100 g of the highly orientated flaky pigment obtained in Example 1 was<br>
further dry-mixed with 5 g cellulose nitrate solution (concentration: 20 % by<br>
weight) in a Waring blender by dropping said cellulose nitrate solution and<br>
then dried to give the highly orientated flaky pigment treated with the<br>
cellulose.<br>
Example 3<br>
100 g flaky pearl pigment (Iriodin® 223 with an average particle diameter of<br>
12 urn, Merck) was suspended in 2.0 I water and heated to about 75 °C<br>
under stirring. The pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 8.0 with 32<br>
weight-% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Then, 46 g aqueous zinc<br>
chloride solution (concentration: 4 % by weight) was dropped to it while the<br>
pH was kept at 8.0 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
After dropping, the pH was decreased to 6.5 with 20 weight-% aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes.<br>
Separately, 100 g water was added to a diethanolamine salt (10 g of 15<br>
weight-% active ingredients in water) of a mixture of diheptadecafluoro-<br>
decyl phosphoric acid [(C8F17C2H4O)2PO(OH)] and heptadecafluorodecyl<br>
phosphoric acid [(C8F17C2H4O)PO(OH)2] and then adjusted to pH 8 with 32<br>
weight-% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
This aqueous solution was dropped to the above suspension while it was<br>
kept at pH 6.5 with 20 weight-% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. After<br>
dropping, the pH value was further decreased to 4 with 20 weight-%<br>
aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, and solids were separated by filtration<br>
from the resulting suspension, then washed and dried at 130 °C for 12<br>
hours, to give the highly orientated flaky pigment. Measurement of this<br>
product by TG/DTA indicated that the amount of the fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound coated on the flaky pearl pigment was 1.4 % by<br>
weight of the pigment, and it was calculated that 94 % by weight of the<br>
charged fluorine-containing phosphate compound was coated on said<br>
pigment.<br>
Example 4<br>
100 g of the highly orientated flaky pigment obtained in Example 3 was<br>
further dry-mixed with 5 g cellulose nitrate solution (concentration: 20 % by<br>
weight) in a Waring blender by dropping said cellulose nitrate solution and<br>
then dried to give the highly orientated flaky pigment treated with the<br>
cellulose.<br>
Example 5<br>
100 g flaky pearl pigment (Iriodin® 223 with an average particle diameter of<br>
12µm, Merck) was suspended in 2.0 I water and heated to about 75 °C<br>
under stirring. The pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 5.8 with 20<br>
weight-% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. Then, 130 g aqueous<br>
aluminium chloride solution (concentration: 5.6 % by weight) was dropped<br>
to it while the pH was kept at 8.0 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution. After dropping, the pH was decreased to 4.8 with 20<br>
weight-% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and the mixture was stirred<br>
for 30 minutes.<br>
Separately, 300 g water was added to 3 g of bis[2-(N-propyl-N-<br>
perfiuorooctane sulfonamide)ethyl] phosphoric acid<br>
[(C8F17SO2N(C3F7)(C2H4O)2PO(OH)] and then adjusted to pH 8 to prepare<br>
an aqueous solution. This aqueous solution was dropped to the above<br>
suspension while it was kept at pH 4.8 with 20 weight-% aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution. After dropping, the pH value was further<br>
decreased to 4 with 20 weight-% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, and<br>
solids were separated by filtration from the resulting suspension, then<br>
washed and dried at 130 °C for 12 hours, to give the highly orientated flaky<br>
pigment. Measurement of this product by TG/DTA indicated that the<br>
amount of the phosphoric acid bis(2-(N-propylperfluorooctanesulfonyl-<br>
amine)ethyl) ester coated on the flaky pearl pigment was 3.0 % by weight<br>
of the pigment, and it was calculated that 99 % by weight of the charged<br>
ester was coated on said pigment.<br>
Example 6<br>
100 g of the highly orientated flaky pigment obtained in Example 5 was<br>
further dry-mixed with 5 g polyacrylate sodium salt solution (concentration:<br>
20 % by weight) in a Waring blender by dropping said sodium salt solution<br>
and then dried to give the highly orientated flaky pigment treated with the<br>
poly acrylate.<br>
Comparative Examples<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
130 g aqueous aluminium chloride solution (concentration: 5.6 % by<br>
weight) was dropped to a suspension of the flaky pearl pigment in<br>
Example 1 while it was kept at pH 5.8 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, and then the fluorine-containing phosphate compound<br>
shown in Example 1 was added thereto with the pH kept at the same value<br>
of 5.8, and the other conditions were the same as in Example 1, to give a<br>
highly orientate flaky pigment. Measurement of this product by TG/DTA<br>
indicated that the amount of the fluorine-containing phosphate compound<br>
coated on the flaky pearl pigment was 1.2 % by weight of the pigment, and<br>
it was calculated that 81 % by weight of the charged fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound was coated on said pigment, and this amount was<br>
lower than the coated amount on the highly orientated flaky pigment in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
46 g aqueous zinc chloride solution (concentration: 4 % by weight) was<br>
dropped to a suspension of the flaky pearl pigment in Example 3 while it<br>
was kept at pH 8.0 with 32 weight-% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution,<br>
and then the fluorine-containing phosphate compound shown in Example 3<br>
was added thereto with the pH kept at the same value of 8.0, and the other<br>
conditions were the same as shown in Example 3, to give a highly<br>
orientated flaky pigment. Measurement of this product by TG/DTA<br>
indicated that the amount of the fluorine-containing phosphate compound<br>
coated on the flaky pearl pigment was 0.5 % by weight of the pigment, and<br>
it was calculated that 34 % by weight of the charged fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound was coated on said pigment, and this amount was<br>
lower than the coated amount on the flaky pigment in Example 3.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A highly orientated flaky pigment was prepared under the same conditions<br>
in Example 1 except that the suspension of the flaky pearl pigment in<br>
Example 1 was adjusted to pH 5.8 and the aqueous solution of aluminium<br>
chloride was not used. Measurement of the product by TG/DTA indicated<br>
that the amount of the fluorine-containing phosphate compound coated on<br>
the flaky pearl pigment was 0.9 % by weight of the pigment, and it was<br>
calculated that 58 % by weight of the charged fluorine-containing<br>
phosphate compound was coated on said pigment, and this amount was<br>
lower than the coated amount on the highly orientated flaky pigment in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Evaluation test<br>
(Evaluation of orientation)<br>
The technical problem solved by the present invention is to maintain a<br>
certain degree of affinity to a medium used in the flaky pigment without<br>
forming any aggregates in the medium and to permit the pigment to float<br>
on the surface of the medium with the pigment being parallel to the liquid<br>
surface. Accordingly, a simple evaluation test (float test) was conducted to<br>
examine whether the pigment floated on the surface of water and toluene<br>
solvent without forming any aggregates, and further a printing test was<br>
conducted after a gravure ink was prepared as a sample.<br>
1. Float test<br>
Method: About 20 ml water or toluene was introduced into a test tube,<br>
and about 0.2 g test sample was added thereto, and the test tube<br>
was shaken up and down by hand and then allowed to stand, and the<br>
state of formation of aggregates on the liquid surface, and the state<br>
of float thereof, were visually observed. The state of float (including<br>
formation of aggregates) was evaluated in the following 3 ranks.<br>
Evaluation 3: All samples floated.<br>
Evaluation 2: Some samples floated, were wetted and dispersed<br>
in the liquid.<br>
Evaluation 1: all samples were wetted and dispersed in the liquid<br>
or sunk on the bottom without being dispersed.<br>
2. Gravure printing test<br>
A gravure ink with the following composition was prepared and a<br>
printing test of the gravure ink was conducted.<br>
Ink composition:<br>
Flaky pigment obtained in Example 1:10 parts by weight CCST ink<br>
medium (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.): 20 parts by weight Diluent<br>
(cyclohexanon): 20 parts by weight.<br>
The ink composition described above was prepared and gravure-<br>
printed by means of a K printing proofer printing machine (R.K. Print-<br>
Coat Instruments Co., Ltd.).<br>
Printing evaluation: The ink was printed on a black and white paper,<br>
and the flaky pigment in the ink was examined for the state of its<br>
arrangement on the surface of the print (orientation) as well as its<br>
coloration and gloss under the following 3 criteria by observation<br>
under an optical microscope.<br>
Evaluation 3: Significant effect<br>
Evaluation 2: Moderate effect<br>
Evaluation 1: Poor effect<br>
