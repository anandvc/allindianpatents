				<td>CONTROL GROUP FOR DIRECTIONAL FINS ON MISSILES AND/OR SHELLS.<br>
The present invention refers to a control group for<br>
directional fins on missiles and/or shells.<br>
In the field of flying objects, such as shells and/or<br>
missiles, which during flight can be suitably directed,<br>
various solutions are used to be able to vary such a<br>
direction.<br>
Currently, the solutions in use in the aforementioned<br>
field can summarily be classified hereafter, according<br>
to the type of control which is foreseen.<br>
A first example is that consisting of a so-called<br>
Cartesian type control.<br>
With this type of control the flying object is equipped<br>
with four fin surfaces arranged on opposite sides with<br>
respect to a diametral direction of the section of the<br>
flying object itself. By moving the first two surfaces<br>
and the second two surfaces, which are opposite to each<br>
other, in an integral manner the flying object, such as<br>
a missile, controls the yawing and pitching movements.<br>
The situation is different if the first and the second<br>
pair of fin surfaces are moved to oppose each other<br>
since in such a way the rolling movement can also be<br>
controlled.<br>
In such an arrangement with two pairs of wing surfaces,<br><br>
to carry out the movement of the control surfaces themselves various motors are necessary; more precisely two motors must be foreseen in the case in which the opposite pairs of fin surfaces are joined together, whereas three or four motors must be foreseen in the case in which one wishes to control the individual fin surfaces with control of the rolling axis. Consequently, there is a certain complicatedness of phased arrangement of the motors, a substantial number of which are foreseen.<br>
A second example is that consisting of a so-called polar type control.<br>
With this type of control only two control surfaces are available under the form of fin surfaces and these fin surfaces, according to the plane in which they are arranged, control the yawing and pitching axes of the flying object. In this second case at least two motors are necessary: the first motor which controls the inclination of the control fin surfaces and the second motor which directs the plane of the fin surfaces themselves along the rolling axis.<br>
A third example consists of a so-called mixed type control.<br>
In this case four fin surfaces are arranged, in sets of two of different types arranged successively along the body of the flying object. Therefore, there are two<br><br>
first different consecutive surfaces which move the<br>
rolling  axis  of  the  flying  object,  whereas  the<br>
remaining  two  different  consecutive  surfaces  are<br>
relative to the yawing and pitching movements.<br>
Also in this case at least two motors are necessary to<br>
move the aforementioned pairs of control surfaces.<br>
All of these examples for one reason or another have<br>
some drawbacks or lackings.<br>
The first example quoted known as cartesian control<br>
requires from two to four motors to command the control<br>
fin surfaces. Moreover, having four fin surfaces, it<br>
has a high aerodynamic resistance.<br>
As for the second example, if on the one hand it has a<br>
better aerodynamic penetration, on the down side the<br>
manoeuvre  thereof  takes  place  in  two  necessarily<br>
successive steps. Indeed,  there is a first step in<br>
which it is necessary to direct the plane of the<br>
control fin surfaces and then a second step which is<br>
used to move them in order to direct the flying object.<br>
All of this has a negative influence on the response<br>
speed of the missile to a command which is sent to it.<br>
Moreover, the control system of the first step requires<br>
that the servomotors have a relevant torque to direct<br>
the plane of the fins along the rolling axis.<br>
Finally,  the third example also has the drawback of<br>
having  two  steps  in sequence  those being the one<br><br>
directing the surfaces and the one for manoeuvre. The<br>
presence of these two successive steps slow down its<br>
capacity  to manoeuvre  with respect  to  the  first<br>
example. Moreover, with respect to the second example<br>
this third example has a higher aerodynamic resistance<br>
foreseeing four different fin surfaces.<br>
A main purpose of the present invention is that of<br>
specifying a different solution to the aforementioned<br>
technical problem which takes account of that which is<br>
foreseen by the prior art outlined.<br>
Another purpose is that of realising a control group<br>
for directional fins for missiles and/or shells which<br>
allows all of the problems previously referred to to be<br>
optimised.<br>
Yet another purpose is that of realising a control<br>
group for directional fins on missiles and/or shells<br>
which has a structure which is extremely simple and<br>
even is also not very expensive, still being capable of<br>
carry out any one of the tasks assigned to it in an<br>
op t ima1 manne r.<br>
The last but not least purpose of the present invention<br>
is that of realising a control group for directional<br>
fins  on missiles  and/or  shells  which  has  a  high<br>
manoeuvrability to be able to follow targets of any all<br>
types in all conditions.<br>
These purposes according to the present invention are<br><br>
achieved by realising a control group for directional fins on missiles and/or shells as outlined in the attached claim I.<br>
Furhter relevant and special characteristics of the present invention are object of the dependent claims. Further characteristics and advantages of a control group for directional fins on missiles and/or shells according to the present invention shall become clearer from the following description, given as an example and not for limiting purposes, of an embodiment of the group with reference to the attached figures in which:<br>
figure 1 is a perspective view of a possible schematic embodiment of a control group according to the present invention for directional fins applied to a flying object, such as a missile or the like, shown only in part,<br>
figure 2 is a longitudinal section view of the control group of the flying object according to the line II-II of figure 4,<br>
figure 3 is a longitudinal section view of the control group of the flying object according to the line Ill-Ill of figure 4,<br>
figure 4 is a cross section of the control group of the flying object according to the line IV-IV of figure 2,<br>
figure 5 is a cross section of the control group<br><br>
of the flying object according to the line V-V of figure 2,<br>
figures 6 and 7 show extremely schematically the angles of rotation of the half-fins and of the rings constituting the control group of the invention. With reference to figure 1 a flying object 11 is generically indicated, such as a shell, a missile and/or the like which is equipped with a control group for directional fins according to the invention, wholly indicated with 12.<br>
The control group 12 can be easily adapted to any type of flying object and allows such an object, moving at supersonic speeds, to be manoeuvred in order to make it strike a designated target. Indeed, this group allows a high manoeuvrability in all of its operating range in order to follow the movements of the target even when it is close to it. The solution adopted allows the system to be controlled also in the presence of a rolling movement of the flying object.<br>
The flying object 11 requires a series of movements defined by a pitching axis X, a yawing axis Y and a rolling axis Z, respectively.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention a schematisation of the flying object 11 in the form of a missile and of its movements defined according to the aforementioned axes is shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Regarding which it must be noted that a control group<br>
12	according to the invention is a so-called polar type<br>
control,  in  which  only  two  command  surfaces  are<br>
available in the form of two fin or half-fin surfaces<br>
13	and 14 which can be directed according to the<br>
direction which one wishes to pursue with the flying<br>
object 11.<br>
The command group of the invention exploits aerodynamic force to direct the plane of the control fin surfaces along the rolling axis Z, in this way by-passing the hindrance of a high pair necessary to direct such a plane directly through a motor.<br>
In the illustrated practical embodiment it should be noted that the control group 12 comprises a containment body 15, of the cylindrical type, in which two housings 16 are formed, with their axis parallel to the axis of the containment body 15, but eccentric and diametrally opposed. Each housing 16 receives a respective electrical motor 17 and 17' which commands an end sprocket 19 and 19' through a relative shaft 18 and 18' .<br>
It should be noted that coaxially to the axis Z of the flying object, aligned with the axis of the containment body 15, a series of three rings 20, 21 and 22 are foreseen. The first ring 20 is free to rotate about the axis Z inserted in an annular seat 23 formed in a<br><br>
portion with a small diameter of the the containment body 15 itself. The first ring 20 carries pivot extensions 24 of the two half-fins 13 and 14, fastened through axial locking elements 25, but free to rotate, which are thus pivoted to it and arranged at 180° from each other. In their rear part the two half-fins 13 and 14 carry a small radial extension 34. facing towards the inside of the body 15, which engages in a curved slot 35 formed in an extension 20' of the ring 20. In such a way, as can clearly be seen in figure 1, each half-fin 13 and 1.4 is guided and has a limited oscillation.<br>
In their front part the half-fins 13 and 14 each carry an attachment 26 which can be made to oscillate with a suitable engagement with the rings 21 and 22. It should be noted how the two rings 21 and 22 are also arranged in respective grooved annular seats 31 and 32 at least partially formed in two separate portions 15' and 15' of the containment body 15 which are then fastened to said body through stable fastening elements, such as bolts schematised at 33. In such a way the containment body 15, 15' and 15' ' , once assembled, can be considered as a single piece.<br>
Figures 2-5 show a non-limiting embodiment of the control group of the present invention. It should thus be noted that, for example, the attachment 26 of the<br><br>
first half-fin 13 inserts into a localised gmoTe 27 of the third ring 22 so that a rotation thereof determines its oscillation about the respective pivot 24 arranged in the first ring 20. However, this localised groove 27 protrudes forking towards the second ring 21 inserting itself into a groove 28 of the second ring, formed facing along about a quarter of the circumference of the second ring itself and being of a depth of little more than that of each attachment 26.<br>
The third ring 22 in a position diametrically opposed to the aforementioned localised groove 27 also has a groove 28 formed along about a quarter of its circumference and being of a depth of little more than that of each attachment 26. In such a way, the attachment 26 of the second half-fin 14 inserts into a localised groove 27 of the second ring 21, which protrudes forking towards the third ring 22 inserting into its groove 28. In this way the attachment 26 of the second half-fin 14 inserts into the localised groove 27 of the second ring 21 so that a rotation thereof determines its oscillation about the respective pivot 24 also arranged in the first ring 20. For better guiding in their possible oscillation or rotation the rings 21 and 22 have surface and perimetric extensions 21' and 22' which are housed in perimetric surface extensions of the respective annular<br><br>
seats 31 and 32.<br>
It should be noted that the two rings 21 and 22 are in turn each controlled by a respective electric motor 17 and 17', which, as stated, commands, through a relative shaft 18 and 18', an end sprocket 19 and 19'. This sprocket 19 and 19' in turn engages in a gear-down 29 and 29' which finally engages in a toothing 30 and 30' formed inside each of the two rings 21 and 22. The gear-down 29 and 29' can foresee a spindle 36 carrying a pair of sprockets, of different diameters and fitted onto it, one which engages with the sprocket 19 and 19' and the other with the toothing 30 and 30' formed internally on the respective rings 21 and 22. Such a spindle 36 is brought onto the two separate portions 15' and 15' of the containment body 15 itself. In this way each electric motor 17 and 17', through an appropriate gear-down group (consisting exclusively of cylindrical wheels 19, 29; 19', 29'), is capable of making the half-fins 13 and 14 take up angles Si and 62 with respec to the axis of the shell Z.<br>
Figures 2, 4 and 5 show the normal arrangement of the half-fins 13 and 14 aligned according to the axis Z of the containment body 15 of the control group 12, whereas figure 1 shows an oscillated operating position of a certain angle of the two half-fins 13 and 14. Figures 6 and 7, which are totally schematic, help to<br><br>
understand what are the angles of rotation of the half-fins 13 and 14 and of the rings 20, 21 and 22 constituting the control group 12 according to the present invention.<br>
The command with respect to the flying object  11 pitching and/or yawing is equal to (Si + 52)/2, whereas the rolling position is subject, through aerodynamic pairs, to the amount  (5i - 52)/2. In other words, if the half-fins 13 and 14 move concurrently as the same piece the flying object manoeuvres to pitch and/or yaw, whereas if the half-fins do not move concurrently the system  is directed about the rolling axis Z. In an example, using as reference symbols a, (3 and y, only the first of which is shown, the rotations about the rolling axis Z of the three rings 20, 21 and 22 and t a generic transmission ratio, it can be seen (through kinematic   considerations)    that   the   following relationships are valid. 5;  =   (3 - y) / t 5;  =   (a - y) / T (51 + 52)/2    =    (3 - y) / 2  / T<br>
pitching/yawing command<br>
(63 - 52)/2 = (3 + y - 2a) / t rolling position command<br>
The advantage with respect to other systems or control groups is that to move about the rolling axis Z it<br><br>
exploits the aerodynamic pair which develops when the<br>
angles of incidence of the fins 5i and 52 are different<br>
thus avoiding the need for the servomotors 17, 17' to<br>
supply a high torque.<br>
This proposed solution is obviously particularly useful<br>
for commanding missiles, shells and/or the like through<br>
the movement of suitable control fin surfaces (13, 14).<br>
Thus, the main purpose of the present invention is<br>
achieved which proposed to manoeuvre an object, such as<br>
a missile and/or shell,  which moves  at  supersonic<br>
speed, so as to make it strike a designated target.<br>
The whole thing,  obviously,  with a high and easy<br>
manoeuvrability  so  as  to  be  able  to  pursue  the<br>
movements of the target even when close to the target<br>
itself.<br>
With the solution of the present invention previously<br>
outlined it is made possible to control the flying<br>
object also in the presence of a rolling movement of<br>
the flying object itself.<br>
The  control  group  of  the present  invention,  thus<br>
conceived,  is  obviously  susceptible  to  numerous<br>
modifications  and  variants,  all  covered  by  the<br>
invention itself.<br>
Moreover, in practice the parts and the materials used,<br>
as well as their sizes and components, can be whatever<br>
according to the specific technical requirements.<br><br>
The scope of protection of the present invention is therefore defined by the attached claims.<br><br>
