				<td>NUCLEAR RECEPTOR BINDING AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The present invention relates to a novel class of nuclear receptor binding agents (NRB As). The NRBA are applicable for use in the prevention and/or treatment of a vaR1ety of diseases and conditions including, inter alia, prevention and treatment of hormone-related diseases including prostatic diseases, cancers, urogenital, gastrointestinal, inflammation, osteoporosis, peR1pheral vascular disease, neurological and mood disorders, oxidative damage related diseases such as Parkinson's and stroke, ocular disorders, neuroprotection, arthR1tis, prostate cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), hot flashes, breast cancer, anti-angiogenic diseases, bladder cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcR1ption factors is present in vaR1ous tissues, and responsible for a multitude of effects in these tissues.<br>
[004] The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily presently compR1ses approximately 48 different proteins, most of which are believed to function as ligand activated transcR1ption factors, exerting widely different biological responses by regulating gene expression. Members of this family include receptors for endogenous small, lipophilic molecules, such as steroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D and thyroid hormone.<br>
[005] The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily includes the steroid nuclear receptor subfamily, including the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) (or aldosterone receptor), the estrogen receptors (ER), ER alpha (ER-α) and ER beta (ER-β), the androgen receptor (AR), the progesterone receptors (PR), glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and others. Also closely related in structure are the estrogen related receptors (ERRs) ERR-alpha, ERR-beta and ERR-gamma. The steroid nuclear receptors perform important functions in the body, some of which are related to the transcR1ptional homeostasis of electrolyte and water balance, growth, development and wound healing, fertility, stress responses, immunological function, and cognitive functioning. The effects may be mediated by cytosolic, mitochondR1al or nuclear events. Accordingly, compounds that modulate (i.e. antagonize, agonize, partially antagonize, partially agonize) the activity of steroid nuclear receptors are important pharmaceutical agents that have specific utility in a number of methods, as well as for the treatment and prevention of a wide range of diseases and disorders modulated by the activity of steroid nuclear receptors. For instance, ER-β is present in, among other tissues, brain, bone, immune system, gastrointestinal tract, lung, ovary, endometR1um, prostate, vasculature, urogenital tract, salivary gland, etc. The role of ER beta in these tissues was confirmed by observed phenotypes in ER beta knockout mice.<br><br>
Pathologies in these tissues may be treated by administration of ER-β selective ligands. ER-β in some cases functions as an antagonist of ER-α through heterodimeR1zation with ER-α. For instance, agonists of ER-β may block the proliferative influence of ER-a in tissues such as prostate and breast where ER-a is known to promote neoplasia. In addition to its anti- ER-α mediated growth inhibition, ER-β autonomously inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation of prostate and other cancers. ER-β is also believed to antagonize the proliferative effects AR in prostatic tissues. Prostatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia/dysplasia may result from a combination of androgenic stimulation of proliferation and/or failed activation of ER-β by locally synthesized estrogens. This hypertrophy or hyperplasia/dysplasia often leads to a vaR1ety of prostatic malathes such as BPH, prostatic inflammatory atropy (a precursor to neoplasia), PIN, and CaP. Administration of exogenous ER-β agonists can be expected to provide prostatic anti-proliferation thereby being beneficial in the prevention or treatment of these prostatic diseases. Additionally, decreased side effects can be expected for ER-β selective agents compared to isoform nonselective ligands for treating many of these diseases.<br>
[006] Non-lipid level dependent effects of estrogens on the vasculature are well known as evidenced by the cardioprotection conferred to pre-menopausal women by endogenous estrogen. Estrogens produce a direct vasodilatation (i.e. decreased vascular contractility or vascular tone) on a wide vaR1ety of vascular tissues which reduces systemic vascular resistance and improves microvascular circulation. Estrogens also reduce vascular cell proliferation and migration, vasoreactivity and hypertrophic remodeling, and vascular fibrosis. Although ER-a and ER-β are both thought to function in the vasculature, the deletion of ER-β as in knockout mice produces an elevation of b100d pressure and moderate cardiac hypertrophy suggesting ER-β has a role in maintenance of vascular tone and proliferation. This cumulatively suggests that ER-β agonists may have therapeutic utility in hypertension, and a vaR1ety of other cardiovascular diseases such atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure. Some of the rapid effects of estrogens, particularly in the vasculature are believed to be independent of protein expression (i.e. nongenomic). [007] Members of the steroid nuclear receptor sub-family exhibit significant homology to each other and possess closely related DNA and ligand binding domains. Given the close similaR1ty in ligand binding domains of the steroid nuclear receptors, it is not surpR1sing that many naturally occurring and synthetic molecules possess the ability to modulate the activity of more than one steroid nuclear receptor. [008] In some embodiments of this invention, the NRBAs may also have anti-oxidant activity. Many of the processes that occur in vivo such as oxidative phosphorylation result in the production of a vaR1ety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are free radical and/or unstable molecules such as superoxide (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These ROS react with a vaR1ety of endogenous macromolecules such<br><br>
as DNA, lipids, and proteins, oxidizing them and compromising their function. Over time this oxidative damage accumulates, producing or exacerbating vaR1ous age-related pathologies. Nonlimiting examples include neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, many types of cancer to include prostate and colon, vascular diseases such as stroke and vaR1ous age-related dementias, and atherosclerosis, to name just a few oxidative stress related pathologies. Molecules such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols such as deR1ved from wine, and phytoestrogens such as genistein and coumestrol deR1ved from soybean products have functional groups which can be oxidized by ROS. This chemical reaction returns the ROS to innocuous species such as oxygen (O2) and water, limiting the pathological damage inflicted to the cellular mileau. Additionally, ER-mediated antioxidant effects has been observed via induction of the expression of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase mat inactivate ROS. Hence, anti-oxidants are thought to exert an anti-aging influence when given on a regular basis. The combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiprohferative/prc-differentiation activities in the NRBAs of this invention may make them particularly potent chemopreventative agents for a vaR1ety of age-related diseases.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
[0038]	The present invention provides novel NRBAs and compositions compRIsing the same.<br>
[0039]	This invention provides NRBAs. In one embodiment, a NRBA refers to a compound that<br>
affects estrogen receptor activity. In one embodiment, a NRBA exhibits activity as an agonist, or, in another embodiment, as an antagonist, or in another embodiment, as a partial agonist, or in another embodiment, as a partial antagonist of the estrogen receptor. In one embodiment, the NRBA exerts its effects on the estrogen receptor (e.g., ERa, ERP or ERRs) in a tissue-dependent manner. In some embodiments, the NRBA of this invention can act as estrogen receptor agonists in some tissues (e.g., bone, brain, and/or heart) and as antagonists in other tissue types, for example in the breast and/or uteR1ne lining.<br>
[0040]	In one embodiment, a NRBA of this invention will have an IC50 or EC50 with respect to<br>
ERa and/or ERp of up to about 10 μM as determined using the ERa and/or ERβ transact) vation assays, as known in the art, or, in other embodiments, as described herein. In some embodiments, the NRBA exhibit EC50 or IC50 values (as agonists or antagonists) of about 5 uM, or less than about 5 uM. Representative compounds of the present invention have been discovered to exhibit agonist or antagonist activity with respect to the estrogen receptor. Compounds of the present invention exhibit, in some embodiments, an antagonist or agonist IC50or EC50 with respect to ERα and/or ERβ of about 5 μM or less than about 5 μM, or in some embodiments, up to about 500 nM, or in other embodiments, up to about 1 nM, as measured in ERa and/or ERβ transactiyation assays. The term "IC50" refers, in some embodiments, to a concentration of the NRBA which reduces the activity of a target (e.g., ERα or ERβ) to half-maximal level.

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[00158] In some embodiments, this invention provides methods of use which compR1se administering a composition compRIsing the described compounds. As used herein, "pharmaceutical composition" means a "therapeutically effective amount" of the active ingrethent, i.e. the compound of this invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carR1er or diluent. A "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to that amount which provides a therapeutic effect for a given condition and administration regimen.<br>
[00159] As used herein, the term "administering" refers to bringing a subject in contact with a compound of the present invention. As used herein, administration can be accomplished in vitro, i.e. in a test tube, or in vivo, i.e. in cells or tissues of living organisms, for example humans. In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering the compounds of the present invention to a subject.<br>
[00160] The pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of this invention can be administered to a subject by any method known to a person skilled in the art, such as orally, parenterally, intravascularly, paracancerally, transmucosally, transdermally, intramuscularly, intranasally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, sublingually, intrapeR1toneally, intraventR1cularly, intracranially, intravaginally, by inhalation, rectally, intratumorally, or by any means in which the recombinant virus/composition can be delivered to tissue (e.g., needle or catheter). Alternatively, topical administration may be desired for application to mucosal cells, for skin or ocular application. Another method of administration is via aspiration or aerosol formulation.<br>
[00161] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered orally, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for oral administration, i.e. as a solid or a liquid preparation. Suitable solid oral formulations include tablets, capsules, pills, granules, pellets, powders, and the like. Suitable liquid oral formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils and the like.

[00162] In one embodiment, the micronized capsules compR1se particles containing a compound of this invention, wherein the term "micronized" used herein refers to particles having a particle size is of less than 200 microns, or in another embodiment less than 100 microns, or in another embodiment, less<br><br>
than 60 microns, or in another embodiment, less than 36 microns, or in another embodiment, less than 16 microns, or in another embodiment, less than 10 microns, or in another embodiment, less than 6 microns.<br>
[00163] Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by intravenous, intraarteR1al, or intramuscular injection of a liquid preparation. Suitable liquid formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils and the like. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intravenous administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraarteR1ally, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intraarteR1al administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intramuscularly, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intramuscular administration.<br>
[00164] Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered topically to body surfaces, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for topical administration. Suitable topical formulations include gels, ointments, creams, lotions, drops and the like. For topical administration, the compounds of this invention or their physiologically tolerated deR1vatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carR1er.<br>
[00165] Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered as a suppository, for example a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository. Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet. In a further embodiment, the pellet provides for controlled release of a compound as herein described over a peR1od of time. In a further embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravaginally.<br>
[00166] In another embodiment, the active compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1627-1633 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez- Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 363-366 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid).<br>
[00167] As used herein "pharmaceutically acceptable carR1ers or diluents" are well known to those skilled in the art. The carR1er or diluent may be a solid carR1er or diluent for solid formulations, a liquid carR1er or diluent for liquid formulations, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[00168] Solid carR1ers/diluents include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g. corn starch, pregeletanized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic mateR1al (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose), an acrylate (e.g. polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide,<br><br>
talc, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[00169] In one embodiment, the compositions of this invention may include, a compound of this invention or any combination thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
[00170] It is to be understood that this invention encompasses any embodiment of a compound as described herein, which in some embodiments is referred to as "a compound of this invention".<br>
[00171] Suitable excipients and carR1ers may be, according to embodiments of the invention, solid or liquid and the type is generally chosen based on the type of administration being used. Liposomes may also be used to deliver the composition. Examples of suitable solid carR1ers include lactose, sucrose, gelatin and agar. Oral dosage forms may contain suitable binders, lubR1cants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. Liquid dosage forms may contain, for example, suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, thickeners, and melting agents. Parenteral and intravenous forms should also include minerals and other mateR1als to make them compatible with the type of injection or delivery system chosen. Of course, other excipients may also be used.<br>
[00172] For liquid formulations, pharmaceutically acceptable carR1ers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or oils. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carR1ers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, cyclodextR1ns, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oR1gin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.<br>
[00173] Parenteral vehicles (for subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarteR1al, or intramuscular injection) include sodium chloR1de solution, ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloR1de, lactated ringer's and fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutR1ent replenishers, electrolyte replenishers such as those based on ringer's dextrose, and the like. Examples are steR1le liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carR1ers, particularly for injectable solutions. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oR1gin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.<br>
[00174] In addition, the compositions may further compR1se binders (e.g. acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone),   disintegrating   agents   (e.g.   cornstarch,  potato   starch,   alginic   acid,   silicon   dioxide,<br><br>
croscarmelose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate), buffers (e.g., TR1s-HCI., acetate, phosphate) of vaR1ous pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., cremophor, glycerol, polyethylene glycerol, benzlkonium chloR1de, benzyl benzoate, cyclodextR1ns, sobitan esters, steaR1c acids), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents(e.g. carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, euiyl cellulose, guar gum), sweetners (e.g. aspartame, citR1c acid), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), coloring agents, lubR1cants (e.g. steaR1c acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g. thethyl phthalate, tR1ethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g. carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g. ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates), and/or adjuvants.<br>
[00175] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are controlled release compositions, i.e. compositions in which the compound of this invention is released over a peR1od of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the compound is released immediately after administration.<br>
[00176] In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC CR1t. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:607 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:674 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeR1c mateR1als can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 116-138 (1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1627-1633(1990).<br>
[00177] The compositions may also include incorporation of the active mateR1al into or onto particulate preparations of polymeR1c compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or<br><br>
spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance.<br>
[00178] Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibothes directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.<br>
[00179] Also comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in b100d following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.<br>
[00180] The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingrethent is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingrethent. For oral administration, the compounds of this invention or their physiologically tolerated deR1vatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the compounds of this invention or their physiologically tolerated deR1vatives such as salts, esters, yV-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.<br>
[00181] An active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloR1c or phosphoR1c acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaR1c, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be deR1ved from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferR1c hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, tR1methylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the<br><br>
like.<br>
[00182] For use in medicine, the salts of the compound will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloR1c acid, sulphuR1c acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaR1c acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citR1c acid, tartaR1c acid, carbonic acid or phosphoR1c acid.<br>

[00461]	Cardiovascular cells, as well as reproductive tissues, bone, liver, and brain, express both of<br>
the known estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor-a (ER-o) and estrogen receptor-p (ER- P). These<br>
receptors are important targets for endogenous estrogen, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), and<br>
pharmacological estrogen agonists. Estrogen-estrogen receptor complexes serve as transcR1ption factors<br>
that promote gene expression with a wide range of vascular effects, including regulation of vasomotor<br>
tone and response to injury, which maybe protective against development of atherosclerosis and ischemic<br>
diseases. Estrogen receptors in other tissues, such as the liver, may mediate both beneficial effects (e.g.,<br>
changes in apoprotein gene expression that improve lipid profiles) and adverse effects (e.g., increases in<br>
gene expression of coagulation proteins and/or decreases in fibR1nolytic proteins). Two general estrogen-<br>
mediated vascular effects are recognized. Rapid, transient vasodilation occurs within a few minutes after<br>
estrogen exposure, independently of changes in gene expression. Longer-term effects of estrogen on the<br>
vasculature, such as those related to limiting the development of atherosclerotic lesions or vascular injury,<br>
occur over hours to days after estrogen treatment and have as their hallmark alterations in vascular gene<br>
expression. Progesterone and other hormonal receptors are also expressed in the vasculature.<br>

Diabetic neuropathies are classified as peR1pheral, autonomic, proximal, and focal. PeR1pheral neuropathy causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms. Autonomic neuropathy causes changes in digestion, bowel and bladder function, sexual response, and perspiration and can also affect the nerves that serve the heart and control b100d pressure. Proximal neuropathy causes pain in the thighs, hips, or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs. Focal neuropathy results in the sudden weakness of one nerve, or a group of nerves, causing muscle weakness or pain. Any nerve in the body may be affected.<br>
[00491]	In one embodiment, the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this<br>
invention is one with hypeR1nsulinemia. HypeR1nsulinemia is a sign of an underlying problem that is causing the pancreas to secrete excessive amounts of insulin.

. resistance in fat cells results in hydrolysis of stored tR1glyceR1des, which elevates free fatty acids in the<br>
b100d plasma. Insulin resistance in muscle reduces glucose uptake whereas insulin resistance in liver<br>
reduces glucose storage, with both effects serving to elevate b100d glucose. High plasma levels of insulin<br>
and glucose due to insulin resistance often leads to the metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.<br>

[00508]	Inflammation is a common and potentially debilitating condition that occurs when the white<br>
b100d cells and endogenous chemicals that can protect us from infection and foreign substances such as bacteR1a and viruses act on tissue surrounding a wound or infection. In some diseases, however, the body's defense system (immune system) tR1ggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. Some, but not all types of arthR1tis are the result of misdirected inflammation. ArthR1tis is a general term that descR1bes inflammation in joints and affects more than 2-4% of the world's population. There are many medications available to decrease swelling and inflammation and hopefully prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. The medications include non-steroidal and-<br><br>
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs - such as aspiR1n, ibuprofen or naproxen), corticosteroids (such as<br>
prednisone), anti-malaR1al medications (such as hydroxychloroquine), and other medications including<br>
gold, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, cyclophosphamide and cyclospoR1ne.<br>
[00509]	Hie role of estrogen receptor and its ligands as therapy for inflammation has been under<br>
consideration. The effects are regarded to be mediated by the isoform ER-β\ Treatment of rats with estradiol or SERMs such as raloxifene and tamoxifen has been shown to reduce the incidence of lipo-polysacharR1de induced inflammatory responses. One of the pathways through which inflammatory responses are mediated is through the activation of NFKB pathway. Nuclear receptor ligands inhibit the NFKB activity through protein protein interaction. Recently it was shown that SERMs inhibit the inflammatory responses by inhibiting the NFKB function without having estrogenic effects on other reproductive tissues.<br>

[00514]	In one embodiment, joint inflammation is one of the most common causes of pain,<br>
lameness, and loss of physical activity, not only in humans but in animals, particularly horses. This debilitating condition is marked by edema, redness, heat and pain. If left untreated, joint inflammation also can lead to destruction of the joint synovium and the articular cartilage producing a permanent debilitating condition. The edema, redness, and pain that occur during inflammation are the result of physiological changes in the joint. For example, the permeability of the synovial membrane increases during inflammation allowing synovial fluid to leak into the tissues of the joint. Alterations in b100d flow and pressure in the vascular system of the joint also occur during inflammation. In addition, the metabolic activity of the cells of the joint increases during inflammation.<br>

[00517]	In another embodiment, the NRBAs of this invention bind cognate receptors and translocate<br>
within the mitochondR1a, whereupon they associate with mitochondR1al DNA, and in turn play a role in the increased respiratory chain activity, inhibition of TGFp-induced apoptosis and/or activation of manganese superoxide dismutase, and others.<br>
[00518]	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are key enzymes in the cellular defence against free radical<br>
oxidation. By catalyzing the degradation of the superoxide free radical to water and hydrogen peroxide, SODs, play an important role in reducing the damage associated with, for example ischemic injury, chronic lung disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease, immune-system decline, brain dysfunction, cataracts, and other aspects of aging and degenerative disease.<br>
[00519]	In one embodiment, this invention provides a method of treating, ameliorating and/or<br>
preventing reactive species-mediated damage in a subject, compRIsing the step of administering a NRBA of formula (IHXII) or its prodrug, analog, isomer, metabolite, deR1vative, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, polymorph, crystal, impuR1ty, Af-oxide, ester, hydrate or any combination thereof to the subject. In one embodiment, the reactive species compR1ses reactive oxygen intermediates and the NRBA promotes or enhances the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase. In one embodiment, the reactive species compR1ses reactive nitrogen intermediates and the NRBA promotes or enhances the activity of cellular nitR1c oxide synthase.<br>
[00520]	In some embodiments, such damage is associated with a vaR1ety of diseases, such as, but not<br>
limited to cardiovascular disease, such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and/or multiple sclerosis, infection, for example, HCV infection and complications thereof, autoimmune disease, such as lupus, cancer, and others, as appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[00521]	In some embodiments, such activity results in suppression of pathogenic apoptosis, for<br>
example, as occurs in vaR1ous disease states, such as neurodegenerative diseases or disorders, glaucoma, autoimmune disease, and others as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>

For example, and in one embodiment, the compounds may interact with cellular proteins and thereby synergize a desired effect, in some embodiments, in signaling pathways within the cell, producing the desired effect. In other embodiments, the compounds of formulae I - XII antagonize a particular response or pathway in the cell, which<br><br>
otherwise produces an undesired effect, for example, exacerbating disease, and thus the compounds as described herein are effective in such methods by their ability to disrupt or interfere or antagonize pathogenic mechanisms in a cell or in a subject.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinities. Agonist and Antagonist Activity of Some Embodiments of<br>
NRBAs of the Invention MateR1als and Methods: [00527]     ER binding affinity was determined via one of the following methods: Method 1:<br>
[00528]     Human recombinant estrogen receptor (ER) was expressed in insect Sf9 cells and a radioactive competitive binding assay was performed using tR1tiated estradiol. If the NRBAs tested showed a &gt;&gt; 50% inhibition of [3H] estradiol binding at 1 uM (1000 nM) concentration, the compounds were assayed using four concentrations to determine IC50 and Kj estimates. Method 2:<br><br>
[00529] Estrogen receptor (ER) binding affinity of the NRBAs was also determined using an in vitro competitive radioligand-binding assay with [^-estradiol ([3H]-E2, PerkinElmer), a high affinity ligand for both ERa and ER0. The equiUbR1um dissociation constant (K,/) of [3H]-E2 was determined by incubating increasing concentrations of [3H]-E2 (0.01 to 10 nM) with bacteR1ally expressed ERa or 0 ligand binding domain (LBD) at 4°C for 18 hours (h). Non-specific binding was determined by adding 1000 nM E2 to the incubation mixture. It was determined that the minimum concentration of [3H]-E2 required to saturate ERa and ER0 binding sites in the incubation mixture was 1 nM, respectively. The binding affinity of the NRBAs was determined under identical conditions by incubating increasing concentrations (3xl02 to 1,000 nM) of ligand with isolated ER LBD and 1 nM [3H]-E2. Following incubation, bound and free I3!!]^ was separated by using vacuum filtration with the Harvester (PerkinElmer). BR1efly, the incubation mixture was filtered through a high affinity protein binding filter, and washed several times to remove any unbound radioactivity. The filter plate was air dR1ed and sealed on the bottom. Scintillation cocktail was added to each well and the top of the plate was sealed. Radioactivity was counted in a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation Counter.<br>
[00530] Specific binding of [3H]-E2 (B) at each concentration of NRBA was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific binding of [3H]-E2, and expressed as a percentage of the specific binding of [3H]-E2 in the absence of the NRBA (B0). The concentration of the NRBA that reduced the specific binding of [3H]-E2 by 50% (IC50) was determined by computer-fitting the data by nonlinear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) to the following equation:<br>
B = B0*[l-O(lC50+Q]<br>
where C is the concentration of SERM. [00531]     The equilibR1um dissociation constant (JQ of the NRBA was calculated by: Ki = Kd*lCxl{Kd + L)<br>
where Kj is the equilibR1um dissociation constant of [3H]-E2 (ERa=0.65 nM, ER0=1.83 nM), and L is<br>
the concentration of [3H]-E2 (1 nM). [00532] Table 1 presents a seR1es of NRBAs. Representative NRBAs are described hereinbelow, whose activity under specific expeR1mental conditions is provided. It is to be understood that while the indicated compounds may exhibit a.particular activity (for example, compound 12b is an agonist) under the expeR1mental conditions employed, as a function, in some embodiments of the particular cells utilized, etc., such compounds may possess alternate or vaR1ed activity in different expeR1mental settings.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[00533] Table 2 presents competitive inhibition of the respective estrogen receptors by some embodiments of NRBAs of the invention. Recombinant ERa or ERp ligand binding domain was incubated with [3H]-estradiol and increasing concentration of some embodiments of the NRBAs of this invention, ranging in concentration from 10"u to 10"4 M. Following incubation, plates were harvested onto GF/B filters and radioactivity was measured with a TopCount NXT (PerkinFJmer). Nonspecific binding was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. The percent inhibition of [3H]-estradiol at 100 nM of compound is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
[00534] The NRBAs of Table 3 inhibited Cyp 3A and/or Cyp 2C9 at veiy low concentrations, with the exception of 12b [data not shown].<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Effects of NRBA on ER-g and ER-B transactivation<br>
[00535] COS or 293 cells were plated in DME without phenol red + 10% cs FBS at 90,000 cells per well in 24 well plates, and were transfected with 0.25 ug of the vector "ERE-LUC", where a firefly luciferase gene was dR1ven by two estrogen responsive elements and 0.02 jig of the control CMV-LUC, Renilla where a luciferase gene was dR1ven by a CMV promoter. Also 25 ng of ER-a), 50 ng of ER-B or 12.5 ng of AR were introduced by lipofectamine. All the receptors were cloned from rat tissue into the PCR3.1 vector backbone. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were treated with compounds of this invention, estrogen, DHT, and other NRBAs or combinations thereof. Cells were harvested 48 hrs after transfection, and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity.<br>
[00536] Representative examples of the NRBAs of this invention and their activity under the indicated conditions were as follows<br><br><br>
[00537] RepresentativeTable 4 below has the % estradiol activity at 100 nM of NRBA for representative examples of the NRBAs of this invention and their % estradiol activity at 100nM.<br><br>
[00538]	The compounds 12b, 12f, 12h, 12p, 12s, 12u, 12y and 12z were found to possess ER-0<br>
agonist activity. The binding affinity of the compounds is presented in Figure 5.<br>
[00539]	Table 5 below shows the ratio between the binding constants of ER-a and ER- P for<br>
representative examples of these agonists.<br><br>
[000351]	As an example, the in vitro activation of ER-a and ER- P of 121 compound compared to<br>
estradiol using 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM doses was evaluated (Figure 6) and the data is presented in Table 6 below.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3 Anti-proliferative Effect of NRBAs on Prostate and Colon Cancer Cell Lines<br>
[00540] The effects of treatment of an ER-B selective NRBA of this invention on cancer cell proliferation was examined using LNCaP prostate cancer cells and C-26 colon cancer cells. LNCaP or C-26 cells were plated in growth medium in 24 well and 6 well plates, respectively. LNCaP cells were treated for 6 days and C-26 cells were treated for 3 days at the indicated concentration. 3H thymidine incorporation was measured at the end of treatment as an indicator of cell proliferation. Figures 1 and 2 show that 12b and 12u significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer and C-26 colon cancer cells, respectively, indicative of their potent anti-proliferative effects.<br>
EXAMPLE4 In Vivo Anti-proliferative Effect of NRBAs on Prostate Cancer Xenograft Tumor Growth<br>
[00541] Prostate tumor xenografts were established with LNCaP cells and human prostate stromal cells in nude mice to establish the in vivo anti-proliferative effects of these ER-B NRBAs. A 4:1 ratio (based on cell number) of LNCaP:stroma cells was injected subcutaneously in nude mice and allowed to grow until they attained 100 mm3 in volume, as measured by calipers. The animals were treated with 12b and 12u at 30 mg/kg/day for 21 days. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week and percent tumor volume calculated, after 10, 14 and 21 days. Figure 3 shows that both 12b and 12u inhibited the growth of tumor significantly by day 21, indicating that these NRBAs are anti-proliferative both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
EXAMPLES Anti-inflammatory Effect of NRBAs on Macrophage-Endothelial Cell Adhesion<br>
[00542] To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of ER-B NRBAs in vitro, a macrophage adhesion assay was performed. Macrophages adhere to endothelial cells due to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This pR1nciple was used in this assay to determine the effect of one of the ER-B NRBAs on bacteR1al lipopolysacchaR1de (LPS) induced THP-1 macrophage cell adhesion to bEND-3 endothelial cells. As shown in the Figure 4, 12y (panel A) and 12u (panel B) significantly inhibited the adhesion of 3H labeled THP-1 cells to bEND-3 cells indicative of reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and a subsequent anti-inflammatory effect.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 Effect of the Compounds on TRAP Positive Multinucleated Osteoclasts.<br>
[00543] Bone marrow cells isolated from rat femur are cultured in Alpha MEM without phenol red + 10% steR1le FBS without phenol red in the presence or absence of 30 ng/mL RANKL and 10 ng/ml GMCSF, and the compounds. The cells treated for 12 days are stained for tartarate resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP) positive multinucleated osteoclasts and are counted. Suppression of osteoclast activity is evaluated.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 The Compounds Inhibit Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer Cell Growth<br>
[00544] The prostate cancer cell line PC-3 is plated in RPMI + 10% csFBS at 6000 cells per well of a 96 well plate. Medium is changed to RPMI +1% csFBS without phenol red and cells are treated for 72 hrs with increasing concentrations of NRBAs. Growth inhibition is evaluated.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 In Vivo Estrogenic Activity Of Some Embodiments Of The Compounds<br>
[00545] Female rats are administered increasing doses of toremifene, estrogen and the respective NRBAs, and uteR1ne weights are determined. Rats administered the vehicle alone serve as controls.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Metabolic Stability Of Some Embodiments Of The Compounds In Human Liver Microsomes<br>
[00546] Human liver microsomes are utilized as a representative system in order to assess the potential of the compounds to form pharmacologically inactive or undesired potentially toxic metabolites due to phase I metabolism.<br>
[00547] Each substrate or reference control is dissolved at a concentration of 10 mM in DMSO, from which a 5 uM spiking solution prepared by dilution in water. Substrates (1 MM) are incubated in the presence of human liver microsomes (Xenotech LLC, Kansas City MO) at 0.5 mg/mL fortified with an NADPH regenerating system at 37°C and pH 7.4. The NADPH regenerating system consists of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 units/mL) in 0.05M K2HPO4. Duplicate incubations are performed in 96-well polypropylene cluster tubes in a final volume of 250 pL per reaction. At 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 30, and 60 minutes a stop solution (300 yL acetonitR1le) is added to aliquots of the reaction mixture. Precipitated protein is removed by centR1fugation (3000 rpm for 15 minutes) and the supernatants are transferred to clean 96-well plates for analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis:<br>
[00548] The samples are injected onto a Phenomenex Luna hexylphenyl 50X2 mm i.d. 5 uM, column fitted with a guard column. An isocratic mobile phase consisting of 50% acetonitR1le and 0.1% formic<br><br>
acid in water is used at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The protonated molecular ion (M + H)+ of the<br>
analyte is monitored by MDS/Sciex API 4000QTrap tR1ple quadrupole mass spectrometer using<br>
electrospray positive mode ionization with a temperature of 500°C and a spray voltage of 4000V.<br>
Data Evaluation:<br>
[00549] Metabolic stability is defined as the amount of substrate metabolized by the incubation with<br>
hepatic microsomes and expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of substrate (% remaining)<br>
based on peak area. The initial peak area of each substrate is determined at time zero and metabolic<br>
stability is assessed based on the change in analyte peak area from time 0 min to a single fixed<br>
timepoint for each sample.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Compound Lowering of LDL Cholesterol Levels<br>
[00550] The compounds may be evaluated in clinical tR1al settings. Following administration of the<br>
compounds, their effect in altering lipid profiles in subjects with prostate cancer, undergoing or having<br>
undergone ADT may be similarly evaluated.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
In Vivo Anti-Inflammation Activity<br>
[00551] To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of ER-β1 NRBAs in vivo, animal paws were injected<br>
with carrageenan, which elicits an acute local inflammatory response. Per-oral treatment of 12b, lhr<br>
pR1or to Carrageenan challenge resulted in a 53% reduction in paw edema, measured 4 hours post-<br>
Carrageenan injection, as shown in Figure 7, indicating the compound's anti-inflammatory affect.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
The Effect of NRBAs on the Rat Aorta [00552] ExpeR1mental protocol. Equipment used in these stuthes included a 4-tissue bath system with<br>
reservoirs and circulators (RadnotiGlass Technology, Monrovia, CA), DSI/Ponemah tissue force<br>
analyzer 7700 (Valley View, OH), and iWorx/CB Sciencesforce transducers FT-302. The 250 g rats<br>
were anesthetized with isoflurane to produce deep anesthesia. The chest of the rat was opened, and<br>
about 3 cm length of aorta was removed and placed in a PetR1 dish containing room temperature Krebs<br>
salt solution (KSS, in mM: 120 NaCl, 5 KC1, 1.2 MgSO4 -7H20, 2.5 CaCl2 .2H20, 1 KH2PO4, 25<br>
NaHCO3, and 11 glucose). Fat and connective tissue were removed from the aorta taking care not to<br>
stretch the vessel. The aorta was then divided into 3-mm-wide rings. TR1angular wire holders were<br>
inserted through the lumen of the vessel and connected to the force transducer and tissue holder rod in<br>
the vessel bath.<br><br>
[00553] Data and statistical analyses. Analog-to-digital conversions of force waveforms were accomplished with a DSI/Ponemah tissue force analyzer 7700. The converted data were automatically analyzed with Ponemah Physiology'Smooth Muscle software. All data are summaR1zed as means ± standard error. Differences between means were assessed by a conventional ANOVA. This was followed by Student's test. P
[00554] Preload and equilibration. The tension on the rings was adjusted to 1.0 g passive force using the tension adjustment dial for each transducer and allowed to equilibrate for 60 min in the bath with a 95%C&gt;2-5% CO2 gas mixture. The rings were washed with fresh buffer every 20 min. Passive force was readjusted to 1.0 g as needed during this peR1od. When rings were stable at 1.0 g of passive force, the baseline was calculated.<br>
[00555] Preconditioning of aortic rings. PhenylephR1ne (PE) at a final concentration of 10~7 M was added to the bath to contract the ring, and force was allowed to stabilize for 10 min. Then acetylcholine (ACH) at a final concentration of 10"5 M was added to the precontracted rings to test for endothelial integR1ty (10 min). After the initial test for vessel viability and endothelial integR1ty, the rings were washed three times for 10 min with buffer, allowing it to equilibrate to active force stabilized at 1 g.<br>
[00556] Relaxation protocol. Figure 8 shows a typical concentration-response protocol for NRBAs. Cumulative concentration-response curves to NRBAs were created by increasing the NRBAs concentration in the tissue bath by successive addition of appropR1ate dilutions of stock solutions to achieve final bath concentrations of 300 nM to 0.15 mM NRBAs . Figure 9 shows a typical concentration-response curve generated for NRBAs.<br>
[00557] Contraction protocol. Figure 10 shows a typical concentration-response protocol for PE. After the preconditioning step, the rings were incubated in the baths with a NRBAs for 2 hrs. Then cumulative concentration-response curves to PE were created by increasing the PE concentration in the tissue bath by successive addition of appropR1ate dilutions of stock solutions to achieve final bath concentrations of 1 nM to&gt; 300 uM PE. Figure 11 shows a typical concentration-response curve generated for PE.<br>
[00558] The effect of long-term incubation of aortic rings with NRBAs on aortic ring contractility was stuthed after 15-16 hr incubation of the aortic rings with NRBAs in oxygenated KSS under 0 g tension. Then two subsequent concentrations of norepinephR1ne (NE) were added each for 10 min and the tension was recorded. At the end of the expeR1ment 60 mM KC1 was used to further constR1ct the aortic rings. The results expressed as the percentage of the maximal constR1ction pR1or to the NRBAs incubation are summaR1zed on Figure 12.<br><br>
[00559] Table 7 summaR1zes EC50 values and maximal % decrease of the 10"* PE constR1ction of the aortic ring for individual NRBAs tested via protocol of Figure 8:<br><br>
[00560] Conclusions. The expeR1ments show effects of the some embodiments of the NRBAs of this invention, on rat aorta relaxation. The effects occur at low micromolar concentrations and have rapid time-course effects suggesting non-genomic action as well as longtime-course action possibly involving genomic effects. These effects were similar in aortas from male or female rats indicating there is no gender difference in vascular response under stuthed conditions.<br>
[00561] These effects might confer protective outcome in cardiovascular system and be clinically useful as a substitute for estrogens in preventing cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women as well as men.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 The Effect of GTx-ER-beta Agonists on Proliferation of Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells<br>
[00562] Rationale: Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis have a higher incidence in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women. This loss of cardiovascular protection is often attR1buted to the deficiency in circulating estrogen levels in post-menopausal women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can markedly reduce the R1sk of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women (Kalin MF et al, 1990 and Wenger NK et al., 1993). However, the use of HRT for cardioprotection is limited due to the increased incidence of endometR1al cancer in women and gynecomastia in men. This has led to a search for compound that can provide the beneficial effects of estrogen on the heart but do not have the undesirable side effects on uterus or breast.<br>
[00563] Estrogen action in target tissues is mediated by its interaction with its cognate receptors ER-a and ER-β. Both ER-a as well as ER-0 specific ligands have been shown to modulate cardioprotection in rats (AR1as-Loza et al, 2007). Using isotype selective knockout models, Wada-Hirake et al., 2006<br><br>
showed that the proliferative effects of estrogen on uterus and breast are mediated predominantly through ER-a and not through ER-β. These data indicate that an ideal compound for cardioprotection would be an ER-β specific ligand that would provide cardioprotection alone and have a better safety profile for breast and uteR1ne tissues.<br>
[00564] The pathogenesis of vasculoproliferative disorders like congestive heart disease, arteR1osclerosis and restenosis involves structural changes in the vessel wall characteR1zed by migration of smooth muscle cells (SMC) from the media into the intima and proliferation and deposition of extracellular matR1x proteins (ECM) such as collagen (Dubey et al., 1999). In this study we examined the role of ER-β ligands in preventing a early stage in this process; namely, the proliferation of Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells (RASMC) in culture. MateR1als and Methods Cells and Reagents:<br>
[00565] HyQ- DMEM/F12 1:1 modified medium and fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone LaboratoR1es Inc. DMEM/F12 50:50 was obtained from Cellgro Technologies.   17p Estradiol, Biochanin A, and tamoxifen were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. WST-1 reagent was obtained from Roche. Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle cells (RASMC) were obtained from Lonza, Switzerland. Cell proliferation assay:<br>
[00566] All cells used in the assay were between passage 3 to 5. RASMCs were plated at a density of 1 x 104 cells/well in a 24 well plate, allowed to attach and grown to subconfluence in HyQ-DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS overnight. Cells were then growth arrested by replacing the medium with DMEM (phenol-red free) containing 0.4% BSA for 48 hrs. After 48 hrs, growth was initiated by replacing the medium with DMEM (phenol-red free) + 2.5% FCS containing vehicle or appropR1ate drug concentration for 4 days. Fresh drug-containing medium was added to the cells every 2 days. On the 5th day 50 ul of WST-1 reagent (Roche) was then added to the cells and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Absorbance was then determined in the samples at 450 nm wavelength in a Victor plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Inc, USA). The WST-1 assay is based on the estimation of the cleavage of tetrazolium salts to formazan by cellular enzymes. An expansion in the number of viable cells results in an increase in activity of the mitochondR1al dehydrogenases in the sample. This increased activity results in increased formazan dye formation which gives an absorbance between 420-480 nm. Absorbance measured is directly correlated to the number of metabolically active cells in culture. Absorbance of the cells in control wells on day 0 (GO) of drug treatment was obtained and the cell proliferation following drug treatment was expressed as a percentage of the day 0 growth. Results<br><br>
[00567] We tested a range of compounds in this assay, including an ER-a antagonist (tamoxifen), ER-β agonist (Biochanin A, 141, 12u 14m, 12z) and mixed agonist (estradiol). Cell proliferation was calculated as a percentage of cell number on Day 0 of drug treatment. The ER-β ligands Biochanin A, 141, 12u, and 14m inhibited the proliferation of RASMC in a dose-dependent manner at concentration between 10-30 uM. An increase in absorbance (increase in cell number) from Day 0 was seen in all drug treatments except for the two highest concentrations of tamoxifen (10 uM and 30 uM) indicating that all the ER-β ligands were well tolerated by cells even at the highest concentration. The reduced cell numbers in the tamoxifen (10 uM and 30 uM) compared to day 0 treated wells indicates toxicity of the drug. The EC50 values for the reduction in cell proliferation were calculated for all the drugs and is shown in Table 8.<br>
[00568] Table 8: EC50 values for inhibition of RASMC proliferation by ER-β ligands. EC50 values were calculated using WinNonLin 5.0.1 using the inhibitory effect sigmoid Ema* model.<br><br>
Conclusions:<br>
[00569] ER-β specific ligands in general inhibited the proliferation of RASMC better than a mixed agonist like estradiol. The ER-a antagonist tamoxifen at lower concentration did not have any effect on cell proliferation while at the higher concentration it was shown to be toxic to cells leading to significant reduction in cell numbers. Interestingly the ER-β ligands did not seem to have any toxic effects on cells even at the highest concentration tested, indicating that the observed effect on cell numbers is more a function on cell cycle arrest/progression than apoptosis and cell death. These data indicate that ER-β ligands can significantly inhibit an early step in vascular remodeling and could be of benefit for treatment of vascu100cclusive disorders like arteR1osclerosis and restenosis.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 14 Effect of GTx ER-beta SERMs on Preventing Oxidative Stress in ARPE cells<br>
[00570] Rationale: Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis have a higher incidence in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women. This loss of cardiovascular protection is attR1buted to the deficiency in circulating estrogen levels in the post-menopausal women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can markedly reduce the R1sk of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women (Kalin MF et al, 1990 and Wenger NK et al, 1993). However, the use of HRT for cardioprotection is limited due to the increased incidence of endometR1al cancer in women and gynecomastia in men. This has led to a search for compounds that can provide the beneficial effects of estrogen on the heart but do not have the undesirable side effects on uterus or breast<br>
[00571] Estrogen action in target tissues is mediated by its interaction with its cognate receptors ER-a and ER-β. Bodi ER-a as well as ER-0 specific ligands have been shown to modulate cardioprotection in rats (AR1as-Loza et.al, 2007). The proliferative effects of estrogen on uterus and breast is mediated predominantly through the ER-a while the ER-0 does not have any stimulatory effect on these tissues (Wada-Hirake et.al, 2006). These stuthes make a case for using ER-β specific ligands for cardiovascular protection without the systemic effects that could be expected from ER-a ligands. Oxidative stress is one of the main etiological factors of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, CHD and atherosclerosis. Estrogens through vaR1ous molecular mechanisms (genomic and nongenomic) have been shown to activate intracellular signaling cascades that are involved in the transcR1ptional activation of eNOS and other antioxidant defense genes (Reviewed by Siow RCM et.al, 2007).<br>
[00572] In this study we measured the ability of GTx ER-β compounds to prevent the oxidative damage caused by rm-butyl hydroperoxide (f-BH) on retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE). The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to their location between the photoreceptors and choroid are continuously exposed to high oxygen fluxes. A high level of oxidative stress occurs in the RPE as a result of the formation of abnormal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These features apart from ready availability of the transformed cell line from ATCC makes RPE an ideal system to study the effects of oxidative stress. MateR1als and Methods<br>
[00573] Cells and Reagents: Human ARPE-19 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cells used in the expeR1ments were between passage 9 tol2. HyQ- DMEM/F12 1:1 modified medium and fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone LaboratoR1es Inc. DMEM/F12 50:50 was obtained<br><br>
from Cellgro technologies. 170 Estradiol, Biochanin A were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. WST-1 reagent was obtained from Roche. HBSS media was from Gibco. Dichorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was obtained from (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). ICI was from TocR1s.<br>
[00574] Fluorescent Detection of Intracellular ROS: ARPE-19 cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in a 24 well plate in complete medium (HyQ- DMEM/F12 1:1 modified medium). Cells were allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, media was removed and cells were washed lx widi HBSS. 10 uM H2DCFDA diluted in HBSS was then added to the cells and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 mins. After the incubation peR1od the excess dye was removed and cells washed lx with HBSS. The cells were then preincubated with the respective concentrations of drugs for 1 hour. Following the incubation peR1od oxidative stress was induced with 150 uM tBH for 1 hr at 37 °C. Remove and wash cells once with HBSS. The ability of intracellular ROS to oxidize the dye to its fluorescent product was measured and quantified using a Victor plate reader (Perkin Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, CT; excitation at 485 nm; emission at 535 nm). Each drug concentration was done in tR1plicates. The relative fluorescence was calculated as a percentage of tBH only control. Results<br>
[00575] The ability of ER-β SERMs to prevent oxidative damage induced by 150 uM tBH was measured in ARPE-19 cells using a fluorescence based assay. Estradiol was used as a control for the expeR1ment. The expeR1ment was done in the presence and absence of estrogen receptor antagonist ICI. As seen in Figl, 150 uM tBH was sufficient to cause the accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the ARPE cells following 1 hour of incubation at 37°C. Estradiol at a concentration of 100 nM was able to prevent ROS formation with a reduction in ROS formation of approximately 30%. This inhibitory effect of estradiol was reversed with treatment with 100 nM ICI. The ER-β ligands 141 and 12y were also able to prevent the ROS formation with inhibition of more than 50%. 12z was able to prevent ROS formation as well as estradiol while 12u did not seem to have any effect on prevention of oxidative stress in the ARPE cells. As seen with estradiol the inhibitory effect of the ER-β was reversed with ICI indicating a receptor dependent mechanism of action. Cells treated with oxidant in absence of dye did not result in background fluorescence (data not shown). Conclusions<br>
[00576] ER-β compounds 141, 12z and 12y protected ARPE-19 cells from oxidative damage. This protective effect was reversed with a non-selective ER antagonist ICI indicating that the protective effect is mediated through an estrogen receptor mediated mechanism.<br><br>
