Field of the Invention<br>
The invention provides methods for reducing SOx, NOx and/or CO emissions from fluid streams using mixed metal oxide compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Catalytic cracking is a petroleum refining process that is applied commercially on a very large scale. A majority of the refiner}' gasoline blending pool in the United States is produced by this process, with almost all being produced using the fluid catalytic cracking process. In the catalytic cracking process heavy hydrocarbon fractions are converted into lighter products by reactions taking place at elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst, with the majority of the conversion or cracking occurring in the gas phase. This hydrocarbon feedstock is thereby converted into gasoline, distillate and other liquid cracking products as well as lighter gaseous cracking products of four or fewer carbon atoms per molecule. The gas partly consists of olefins and partly of saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
In catalytic cracking processes, hydrocarbon feedstock is injected into the riser section of a hydrocarbon cracking reactor, where it cracks into lighter, valuable products on contacting hot catalyst circulated to the riser-reactor from a catalyst regenerator. As the endothcrmic cracking reactions take place, heavy material known as coke is deposited onto the catalyst. This reduces the activity of the catalyst and regeneration of the catalyst is desired. The catalyst and hydrocarbon vapors are carried up the riser to the disengagement section of the reactor, where they are separated. Subsequently, the catalyst flows into the stripping section, where the hydrocarbon vapors entrained with the catalyst are stripped by steam injection. Following removal of occluded hydrocarbons from the spent cracking catalyst, the stripped catalyst flows through a spent catalyst standpipe and into the catalyst regenerator.<br>
Typically, catalyst regeneration is accomplished by introducing air into the regenerator and burning off the coke to restore catalyst activity. "These coke combustion reactions are highly exothermic and heat the catalyst. The hot, reactivated catalyst flows through the regenerated catalyst standpipe back to the riser to complete the catalyst cycle. The coke combustion exhaust gas stream rises to the top of the regenerator and leaves the regenerator through the regenerator flue. The exhaust gas generally contains NOx, SOx, CO, oxygen, ammonia, nitrogen and COa.<br>
The three characteristic steps of the catalytic cracking can therefore be distinguished: 1) a cracking step in which the hydrocarbons are converted into lighter products, 2) a stripping step to remove hydrocarbons adsorbed on the catalyst, and 3) a regeneration step to bum off coke from the catalyst. The regenerated catalyst is then reused in the cracking step.<br>
The catalyst regenerator may be operated in complete combustion mode, which has now become the standard combustion mode, in partial CO combustion mode, or in a dual complete/partial combustion mode. In complete combustion operation, the coke on the catalyst is completely burned to CO2 This is typically accomplished by conducting the regeneration in the presence of excess oxygen, provided in the form of excess air. The exhaust gas from complete combustion operations comprises NOx, SOx, CO2, nitrogen and oxygen.<br>
In partial carbon monoxide combustion mode operation, the catalyst regenerator is operated with insufficient air to burn all of the coke in the catalyst to CO2. As a result, the coke is combusted to a mixture of CO and C02. the CO can optionally be oxidized to COa in a downstream CO boiler. The effluent from the CO boiler comprises NOx, SOx, CO2 and nitrogen.<br>
Several approaches have been used in industry to reduce SOx, NOx and CO in cracking catalyst regenerator exhaust gases. These include capital-intensive and expensive options, such as prelreatment of reactor feed with hydrogen and flue gas post-treatment options, and less expensive options, such as the use of catalysts arid catalyst additives.<br>
An early approach used alumina compounds as additives to the cracking catalyst to adsorb sulfur oxides in the FCC regenerator; the adsorbed sulfur compounds that entered the process in the feed were released as hydrogen sulfide during the cracking portion of the cycle and passed to the product recovery section of the unit where they •were removed. However,<br>
while sulfur is subsequently removed from the stack gases of the regenerator in this process, product sulfur levels are not greatly affected.<br>
It is known in the art that NOx can be removed from the flue gas with NHj, which is a selective reducing agent that does not react rapidly with excess oxygen that may be present in the flue gas. Two types of Nlij processes have evolved, thermal and catalytic. Thermal processes operate as homogeneous gas-phase processes at high temperatures, typically around 1550 to 1900°F. The catalytic systems generally operate at much lower temperatures, typically at 300 to 850°F. U.S. Patent No. 4,521,389 describes adding NH3 to flue gas to catalytically reduce the NOx to nitrogen. These flue gas treatments to reduce NOx are powerful, but the capital and operating costs are high. Alternative compositions and methods for reducing NOx and CO in the flue gas of an FCC unit are described in co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/639,688, filed August 13,2003.<br>
Industrial facilities are continuously trying to find new and improved methods to reduce the concentration of NOx, SOx and CO from the emission of FCC units to reduce pollution in the atmosphere. The invention is directed to these and other important ends.<br>

These and other aspects of the invention are described in more detail below. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for reducing SOx, NOx and/or CO emission from gas streams (e.g., FCC units) by adding mixed metal oxide compounds to the gas streams. In one embodiment, the mixed metal oxide compounds are in the form of shaped bodies. In another embodiment, the shaped bodies are dried shaped bodies and/or calcined shaped bodies.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides methods for reducing SOx, NOx and/or CO emission from gas streams (e.g., FCC units) by adding compositions comprising mixed metal oxide compounds to the gas streams.

In another embodiment, the composition is in the form of shaped bodies, such as dried shaped bodies and/or calcined shaped bodies. In one embodiment, the composition optionally further comprises one or more metallic oxidants and/or supports.<br>
To reduce the NOx from the flue gas, the compositions comprising mixed metal oxide compounds of the invention are introduced into an FCC regenerator and are<br>
continuously cycled between the FCC reactor and the regenerator. The compositions of the invention can be used in an unexpectedly small amount to reduce NOx and CO emissions. For example, the compositions of the invention can be used in an amount of about 1 ppm to about 1000 ppm, from about 2 ppm to about 500 ppm; from about 50 pprn to about 250 ppm; or from about 100 ppm to about 200 ppm. Alternatively, the compositions of the invention can be used in an amount of about 0.001 weight% to about 5 weight % of the circulating inventory of the total catalyst in the FCC regenerator; in an amount of about 0.001 weight% to about 1 weight% of the circulating inventory of the total catalyst in the FCC regenerator; or from about 0.01 weight% to about 0.1 weight% of the circulating inventory of the total catalyst in the FCC regenerator. The compositions of the invention can reduce the NOx and/or CO emissions from an FCC unit in about two hours or less; about one hour or less; about thirty minutes or less; about fifteen minutes or less; or about 5 minutes or less.<br>
In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention reduce CO emissions from the regenerator of an FCC unit and/or from the flue gas in the flue of the FCC unit In one embodiment, the invention provides flue gas treatments for reducing CO in the flue of an FCC unit by adding a composition comprising copper and/or cobalt and a carrier to the regenerator of the FCC unit In another embodiment, the invention provides methods for reducing CO emissions from the regenerator of the FCC unit by adding a composition comprising copper and/or cobalt and a carrier to the regenerator of the FCC unit. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides methods for reducing CO in the flue of an FCC unit and for reducing CO emissions from the regenerator of the FCC unit by adding a composition comprising copper and/or cobalt and a carrier to the regenerator of the FCC unit. The carrier can be a hydrotalcite like compound, a spinel, alumina, silica, calcium aluminate, aluminum silicate, aluminum titanate, zinc titanate, aluminum zirconate, magnesium aluminate, aluminum hydroxide, an aluminum-containing metal oxide compound other than A^Os, clay, magnesia, lanthana, zirconia, titania, a clay/phosphate material, magnesium acetate, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium formate, hydrous magnesium silicate, magnesium silicate, magnesium calcium silicate, boria, calcium silicate, calcium oxide, aluminum nitrohydrate, aluminum chlorohydrate, silica/alumina, zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5),or a mixture of two or more thereof. In one embodiment, the carrier is a hydrotalcite like compound, a spinel, alumina, zinc titanate, zinc aluminate or zinc titanate/zinc aluminate.<br>
In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention can be used in conjunction with a CO combustion promoter, such as a platinum and/or alumina CO combustion<br>
promoter. From 0.01 to 100 weight ppm Pt metal, based on the inventory of the regenerator, may be used with good results. Very good results can be obtained with as little as 0.1 to 10 weight ppm platinum present on the catalyst in the unit.<br>
Any conventional FCC feed can be used in the FCC unit The feeds may range from the typical, such as petroleum distillates or residual stocks, either virgin or partially refined, to the atypical, such as coal oils and shale oils. The feed frequently will contain recycled hydrocarbons, such as light and heavy cycle oils which have already been subjected to cracking. Preferred feeds are gas oils, vacuum gas oils, atmospheric resids, and vacuum resids.<br>
Any commercially available FCC catalyst may be used. The catalyst can be 100% amorphous, but preferably includes some zeolite in a porous refractory matrix such as silica-alumina, clay, or the like. The zeolite is usually about 5 to about 40 weight % of the catalyst, with the rest being matrix. Conventional zeolites such as Y zeolites, or aluminum deficient forms of these zeolites, such as dealuminized Y, ultrastable Y and ultrahydrophobic Y may be used. The zeolites may be stabilized with rare earths, for example, in an amount of about 0.1 to about 10 weight %.      Relatively high silica zeolite containing catalysts can be used in the inventioa They withstand the high temperatures usually associated with complete combustion of CO to COj within the FCC regenerator. Such catalysts include those containing about 10 to about 40% ultrastable Y or rare earth ultrastable Y.<br>
The catalyst inventory may also contain one or more additives, either present as separate additive particles, or mixed in with each particle of the cracking catalyst. Additives can be added to enhance octane, such as medium pore size zeolites, e.g., ZSM-5 and other materials having a similar crystal structure.<br>
Conventional riser cracking conditions may be used. Typical riser cracking reaction conditions include catalyst/oil ratios of about 0.5:1 to about 15:1 and a catalyst contact time of about 0.1 to about 50 seconds, and riser top temperatures of about 900 to about 1050°F. It is important to have good mixing of feed with catalyst in the base of the riser reactor, using conventional techniques such as adding large amounts of atomizing steam, use of multiple nozzles, use of atomizing nozzles and similar technology.   The base of the riser may comprise a riser catalyst acceleration zone.

" For example 6, an additional quantity of material was introduced into the test reactor to obtain a<br>
sorbent	concentration comparable to that of Example 5.<br>
The results of the performance test show that the SOi pickup and overall pickup capacity are much greater for Examples 5 and 7 according to the present invention as compared with either spinel or hydrotalcite derived compositions.<br>
The performance of the mixed metal oxide of Examples 5 and 7 are found to have nearly twice the sorption capacity as those based on the spinel of Examples 3 and 4. Compounds of the present invention are accordingly very useful to refiners which are required to control SOi levels with a minimum amount of SOx-absoibing additive. Additionally, the initial rate of SOa pickup is significantly greater than prior art compositions as indicated by the SOa level remaining at a low level of 64 ppm after 1000 seconds of the test as compared with 125 ppm for the collapsed hydrotalcite-like compound and 208-395 ppm for the compositions containing a predominance of spinel. Rapid pickup of SCh is particularly useful for refiners who experience a sudden increase in SOz levels due to a feed change or equipment malfunction and require rapid response from the SOx additive.<br>
