Description<br>
PIGMENT DISPERSIONS WITH POLYMERIC DISPERSANTS HAVING<br>
PENDING CHROMOPHORE GROUPS Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to stable pigment dispersions and pigmented inkjet inks comprising colour pigments that are stabilized by polymeric dispersants having pending chromophore groups which exhibit a structural similarity with the colour pigment.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]  Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-Ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
The dispersant has to meet particulariy high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer. Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants<br><br>
obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing alternating monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in a poor dispersion stability. Improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants. Graft copolymer dispersants consist of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone.<br>
CA 2157361 (DU PONT) discloses pigment dispersions made by using a graft copolymer dispersant with a hydrophobic polymeric backbone and hydrophiiic side chains.<br>
Block copolymer dispersants containing hydrophobic and hydrophiiic blocks have been disclosed in numerous Inkjet ink patents.<br>
US 5859113 (DU PONT) discloses an AB block copolymer dispersant with a polymeric A segment of polymerized glycidyl (meth)acrylate monomers reacted with an aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acid, and a polymeric B segment of polymerized alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers having 1-12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers.<br>
In the design of polymeric dispersants for aqueous Inkjet inks, the above mentioned anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed, are generally hydrophobic groups exhibiting an affinity for the pigment surface.<br>
EP 0763580 A (TOYO INK) discloses an aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one aqueous polymer selected from the group consisting of an aqueous linear urethanic polymer and an aqueous linear acrylic polymer! EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses similar pigment dispersing' agents for. non-aqueous pigment dispersions;<br>
US 5420.187 (T6Y6 INK) discloses a pigment-dispersing agent obtained by polymerizing additipn-poiymerizab   monomer having an acidic functional group and other addition-polymerizable monomer in the<br><br>
presence of a polymerization initiator, the polymerization initiator being a diazotization product prepared by diazotizing at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an anthraquinone derivative having an aromatic amino group, an acridone derivative having an aromatic amino group and an organic dyestuff having an aromatic amino group. In this pigment-dispersing agent, the colorant is located in the polymeric backbone itself.<br>
US 2003044707 (TOYO INK) discloses a dispersing agent for a pigment, comprising a specific compound having a structure wherein a phthalocyanine type molecular skeleton which is adsorptive on the pigment and an oligomer unit or polymer unit which prevents re-agglomeration of the pigment to bring out the effect of dispersion are covalently bonded, and having affinity for a medium or a solvent. Current practice is that the exact or almost the exact chemical structure of the colour pigment is incorporated as the anchor group in the polymeric dispersing agent to assure maximum affinity with the colour pigment. As a consequence, each pigment has its own tailor made polymeric dispersant. In practice, this requires the holding of an inventory of different polymeric dispersants for producing a complete range of colour Inkjet ink sets. The cyan ink with copper phthalocyanine as pigment is a rare exception in that all desired properties are combined in the same pigment. But yellow pigments have to be selected based on the properties that are the most important in their application of Inkjet ink. For example, some yellow pigments are selected for their light stability, while others are selected to obtain images having high colour strength. The holding of such an inventory of different types of polymeric dispersants incurs financial penalties due to additional storage and logistical requirements as well as increasing the possibility of using the "wrong" polymeric dispersant for the production of a particular Inkjet ink. Another disadvantage is that the low solubility of the pigment generally complicates the synthesis of such polymeric dispersants.<br>
For consistent image quality, the Inkjet ink requires a dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport<br><br>
of the ink to a customer and changes in the dispersion medium of the<br>
inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and increasing<br>
concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives. [0014]  Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture a range of stable<br>
pigmented inkjet inks using a single polymeric dispersant obtained by<br>
simple synthesis. Objects of the invention [0015]   It is an object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks using a<br>
polymeric dispersant obtained by uncomplicated synthesis and suitable for<br>
different colour pigments. [0016]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks with high<br>
dispersion stability. [0017]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide inkjet inks<br>
producing images of high image quality with a high optical density. [0018]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description<br>
hereinafter. Summary of the invention [0019]   It has been surprisingly found that inkjet inks with high optical density and<br>
high stability were obtained using a coloured polymeric dispersant wherein<br>
a pending chromophore group exhibits a structural similarity with the<br>
colour pigment, but is smaller in size than the colour pigment. [0020]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a pigment<br>

The colour pigment used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is represented by formula (I)<br><br>
Formula (I) wherein,<br>
R1 to R10 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a halogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, a methoxy group, an ethoxy group.-CF3, -COOH, -COOCH3; -SO2NH-C6H5, -CONH-C6H5, -CONH-C6H5-CONH2 and -CONH2; and a polymeric dispersant having via a linking group covalently linked to its polymeric backbone at least one pending chromophore group which has a molecular weight smaller than 95% of the molecular weight of said colour pigment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment R2, R4, R5, R7, R9 and R10 in Formula (I) are hydrogen.<br>
The colour pigment may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production. Properties. Applications. 3rdth edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769. Particular preferred pigments are C.l. Pigment Yellow 155 and 198. The pigment particles in the pigmented Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the inkjet printing device,<br><br>
especially at the ejecting no2zles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation. The average particle size of the pigment In the pigmented inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 µm. Preferably, the average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 µm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 µm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 µm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved-The pigment is used in the pigmented inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the pigmented inkjet ink. Polymeric dispersants<br>
The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention contains one or more pending chromophore groups linked by a linking group to a polymeric backbone. The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention preferably has a polymeric backbone with a polymerization degree DP between 5 and 1000, more preferably between 10 and 500 and most preferably between 10 and 100. The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention preferably has a number average molecular weight Mn between 500 and 30000, more preferably between 1500 and 10000. The polymeric dispersant has preferably a polymeric dispersity PD smaller than 2, more preferably smaller than 1.75 and most preferably smaller than 1.5.<br>
The polymeric dispersant is used in the pigmented inkjet ink in an amount of 5 to 600 wt%, preferably 10 to 100 wt% based on the weight of the pigment-eric backbones The polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is required for the compatibility between polymeric dispersant and dispersion medium.<br><br>
It is not required that the polymeric backbone has an affinity for the pigment. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous Inkjet inks can be a homopolymer of acrylic acid monomers. A homopolymer is generally incapable of dispersing pigments, but the presence of a pending chromophore group exhibiting a similarity with the pigment ensures an adequate affinity between polymeric dispersant and pigment surface.<br>
The polymeric backbone can also be a statistical copolymer, a block copolymer, a graft copolymer, a comb polymer or an alternating copolymer. Also suitable as polymeric backbone is a gradient copolymer as disclosed by MATYJASZEWSKI, K., et al. Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. Chem, Reviews 2001.vol.101 p.2921-2990. Sometimes it can be useful to include a number of monomers with a high affinity for the pigment surface to enhance certain properties of the inks, e.g. dispersion stability. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous Inkjet inks may contain hydrophobic monomers to increase the affinity of the polymeric dispersant for the pigment surface. However in enhancing this affinity for the pigment surface, care should be taken that enough of the polymeric backbone sticks out to make the pigment particles compatible with the dispersion medium.<br>
In graft copolymers the use of grafted chains of methoxypolyethyleneglycol (MPEG) has been found to be very advantageous in aqueous Inkjet inks. For solvent-based Inkjet inks the use of grafted chains of polyester were found to be very advantageous. A preferred MPEG macromonomer is BISOMER™ MPEG 350MA (methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate) from LAPORTE INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
Preferred grafted chains of polyester in non-aqueous Inkjet inks are derived from 5-valerolactone , ε-caprolactone and/or C1 to C4 alky! substituted ε-caprolactone. The grafted chains can be introduced into the polymeric dispersant through GDI coupling of a polyester-OH chain with a carboxylic acid group of, for example, an acrylic acid monomer in the polymeric backbone of the dispersant. However, it was observed that grafting by free radical polymerization, wherein the polyester chain already<br><br>
coupled to the carboxylic acid group of an acrylic acid monomer was used as a macro-monomer, not only resulted in better dispersion quality and stability of the Inkjet inks but also were obtained by a more reproducible polymeric dispersant synthesis requiring less purification. For radiation curable inks with the dispersion medium comprising or consisting of monomers and/or oligomers, many (co)polymers having good solubility in the dispersion medium were found to be suitable for the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant; The copolymeric backbone consists preferably of no more than 2 or 3 monomer species.<br>
The monomers and/or oligomers used to prepare the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention can be any monomer and/or oligomer found in the Polymer Handbook, Vol. 1+2. 4th edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, et al. Wiley-lnterscience . 1999. Suitable examples of monomers include: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, acryloyloxybenzoic acid and methacryloyloxybenzoic acid (or their salts), maleic anhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylates (linear, branched and cycloalkyl) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acrylates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifluoroethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
tripropyleneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; allyl derivatives such as allyl glycidyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as<br><br>
vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinyiimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halides; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinytesters of carboxylic acids such as vinylacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
Linkina groups<br>
The pending chromophore group is linked by a linking group to the polymeric backbone. The linking group contains at least one carbon atom, one nitrogen atom, one oxygen atom, one phosphorous atom, one silicon atom, one sulphur atom, one selenium atom or one tellurium atom. The linking group has preferably a molecular weight smaller than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, more preferably the linking group has a molecular weight smaller than 80% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, and most preferably the linking group has a molecular weight smaller than 50% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group.<br>
In one embodiment, the linking group is the result of modification of a (co)polymer with a chromophore having a reactive group. Suitable reactive groups on the chromophore include thiol groups, primary or secondary amino groups, carboxylic acid groups or salts thereof, hydroxy! groups, isocyanate groups and epoxy groups. Typical covalent bonds formed by reaction of the chromophore with the polymeric backbone include an amide, an ester, a urethane, an ether and a thioether. In another embodiment, the polymeric dispersant is prepared by copolymerizing monomers of the polymeric backbone and monomers containing a chromophore group. In this case the linking group is already present in the monomer. This polymerization method offers the advantage of well-controlled design of polymeric dispersants for a wide variety of dispersion media. Due to its low solubility, a monomer containing the complete colour pigment as a chromophore group poses problems both in the synthesis of the polymeric dispersants, as well as the suitability of the polymeric dispersant for a wide variety of dispersion media and pigments.<br>
Pending chromophore groups<br>
The pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention exhibits a high<br><br>
similarity with the colour pigment of the pigmented inkjet ink, and has a molecular weight which is smaller than 90%, preferably smaller than 85%, more preferably smaller than 75% and most preferably smaller than 65% of the molecular weight of the colour pigment. The pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant may be represented by formula (II):<br>
wherein, <br>
one of L1, L2 or L3 is said linking group and is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, an unsaturated aliphatic group and a substituted unsaturated aliphatic group; L1, l_2 and/or L3, if not representing said linking group, are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, a carboxylic acid group, an ester group, an acyl group, a nitro group and a halogen; AR1 and AR2 represent an aromatic group; and n represents the integer 0 or 1. I The linking groups L1 and L3 in the pending chromophore group according to Formula (II) consist of all atoms between the polymeric backbone and the first atom of the aromatic group by which the pending chromophore group is linked to the polymeric backbone. The linking group L2 in the pending chromophore group according to Formula (II) consists of all atoms between the polymeric backbone and the carbon atom directly linked to<br><br>
both L2 and the carbonyl group of the acetoacetanilide group in the pending chromophore group according to Formula (II). In a preferred embodiment the pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant may be represented by formula (111):<br>
wherein, <br>
one of R1 to R11 is said linking group formng a covalent bond with said<br>
polymeric backbone;<br>
R1 to R11, if not representing said linking group, are independently<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkenyl<br>
group, an alkoxy group, an alcohol group, a carboxylic acid group, an ester<br>
group, an acyl group, a nitro group and a halogen; or<br>
R7 and R8 may together form a heterocyclic ring. Preferably the<br>
heterocyclic ring formed by R7 and R8 is Imidazolone or<br>
2,3-dihydroxypyrazine, so that a benzimidazolone ring and a<br>
2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaiine ring respectively are formed in Formula (III).<br>
Suitable examples of the pending chromophore group represented by<br>
formula (III) having an unreacted linking group include<br><br><br><br><br>
The pending chromophore group is preferably present in the range of 1 to 30 percentage, more preferably in the range 5 to 20 percentage based on the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone. Polymeric dispersants<br><br>
having a homopolymer or statistical copolymer as polymeric backbone with more than 45 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending chromophore groups exhibit problems of solubility of the polymeric dispersant in the dispersion medium and deterioration of the dispersing properties due to the fact that the dispersant would go flat on the pigment surface. However, in the case of a well-defined block-copolymer a good dispersion can be obtained with 50 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending chromophore groups. This well-defined block-copolymer preferably has at least one block containing no pending chromophore groups. In some cases, the dispersion stability of the pigment according to the present invention can be further improved by increasing the number of pending chromophore groups in the polymeric dispersant. In a preferred embodiment, two, three or more pending chromophore groups are located in close proximity of each other on the polymeric backbone. Close proximity means preferably less than 50 monomeric units, more preferably less than 20 monomeric units and most preferably less than 10 monomeric units between two pending chromophore groups. It is believed that the dispersion stability improvement by more pending chromophore groups is due to the dynamic character of the attaching and detaching of the pending chromophore group to the pigment surface. By increasing the number of pending chromophore groups, the probability that all pending chromophore groups will be in a "detached state" at the same time is expected to decrease. Synthesis<br>
The polymerization process may be a condensation polymerization, in<br>
I which the chain growth is accompanied by elimination of small molecules<br>
such as water or methanol or an addition polymerization, in which the<br>
polymer is formed without the loss of other materials. Polymerization of the<br>
monomers can be conducted according to any conventional method such<br>
as bulk polymerization and semi-continuous polymerization.<br>
The synthesis is preferably performed by a controlled radical<br>
polymerization (CRP) technique. Suitable polymerization techniques<br><br>
include ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization), RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization), MADIX (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthate), catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes), GTP (group transfer polymerization), or nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations.<br>
In one embodiment the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is prepared by a post-polymerization modification with a chromophore. The chromophore is covalently linked to the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant. The post-polymerization modification can be any suitable reaction, e.g. an esterification reaction.<br>
An esterification reaction suitable for post-polymerization modification can be performed using N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI). In a first step, the carboxyiic moieties of the polymer are activated with CD! to form an intermediate imidazole, which is then esterified with the chromophore having a reactive hydroxyl group. The completion of the first step can be observed when the CO2 degassing stops. Synthesis scheme with R representing the chromophore group:<br><br>
Side products of the reaction can be removed by acidifying the aqueous medium used for precipitation of the polymer (hydrolysis of remaining activated esters and protonation of imidazole that remains in water, in this way achieving the separation from the polymer). If the final modified polymer is water-soluble (e.g. modified homopolymer of acrylic acid), a dialysis can be performed to purify the polymer.<br><br>
In another embodiment the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is prepared by a copolymerization with a monomer containing a chromophore group.

Preparation of a pigmented Inkjet ink<br>
[0112]  The pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention may be<br>
prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0113]  Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling<br><br>
and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperses double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat. In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which aclinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
The inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than one pigment, the inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier such as water. For inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment, mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br><br>
After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the inkjet printing system. This technique pennits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application. Spectral Separation Factor<br>
The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance λmax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability. A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80°C.<br>
The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aref .The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the<br><br>
absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength.<br><br>
The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different<br>
inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the<br>
combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over<br>
the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption<br>
spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be<br>
absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these<br>
Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre. EXAMPLES Materials<br>

Measurement methods 1. Measurement of SSF<br>
[0129]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The choice of this reference wavelength is dependent on the pigment(s) used: if the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 400 and 500 nm then the absorbance Aref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 600 nm,<br>
If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 500 and 600 nm then the absorbance Aref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 650 nm, •    If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 600 and 700 nm then the absorbance Aret must be determined at a reference wavelength of 830 nm.<br><br>
addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Gem!ni2000 300 MHz equipped with a SW-probe.<br>
Mn, Mw and polydispersity (PD) values were determined using gel permeation chromatography. For polymers dissolvable in organic solvents PL-mixed B columns (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) were used with THF+5% acetic acid as mobile phase using polystyrene with known molecular weights as calibration standards. These polymers were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of 1mg/mL. For polymers dissolvable in water PL Aquagel OH-60, OH-50, OH-40 and/or OH-30 (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) column combinations were used depending on the molecular weight region of the polymers under investigation. As mobile phase water/methanol mixtures adjusted to pH 9.2 with e.g. disodiumhydrogen phosphate were used with or without the addition of neutral salts e.g. sodium nitrate. As calibration standards polyacrylic acids with known molecular weights were used. The polymers were dissolved in either water or water made basic with ammonium hydroxide at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Refractive index detection was used. An example is now given to illustrate the calculation of the average composition of a random (= statistical) copolymer P(MAA-c-EHA). The Mn of the copolymer was determined with GPC to be 5000. The molar percentage of each monomer type by NMR was determined to be: 45 mole% MAA and 55 mole% EHA. Calculation:<br>
(0.45 X MMAA) + (0.55 x MEHA) = 140.09<br>
5000 /140.09 = total number of monomeric units in average polymer chain = 36<br>
Average number of MAA units = 0.45 x (5000/140.09) = 16 units Average number of EHA units = 0.55 x (5000/140.09) = 20 units Thus, the average composition is P(MAAi6-c-EHA2o). 4. Particle size [0136]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented Inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented Inkjet ink.<br><br>
The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.002%. In the case of a magenta ink, the ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 4. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and water was chosen as a blank.<br><br>
Efficient pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0132]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. Pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30.<br>
3.	Polymer analysis<br>
[0133]   Unless otherwse specified all polymers have been characterized with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) using the following methods. Random or block copolymers were analyzed with NMR by dissolving them in a deuterated solvent. For 1H-NMR ± 20 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCl3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 MHz instrument equipped with an ID-probe. For 13C-NMR ± 200 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD<br><br>
The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet containing 1.5 mL water and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good Inkjet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is preferably below 150 nm.<br>
5. Calculation of %MW<br>
[0138]  The %MW is calculated as the ratio of the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group over the molecular weight of the colour pigment multiplied by 100.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0139]  This example illustrates that pigments in accordance with the present invention can be dispersed in Inkjet inks using a polymeric dispersant having one or more pending chromophore groups that are smaller but similar in chemical structure to the pigment. The polymeric backbone of the dispersant was an alternating polymer, which is known to have poor dispersing capability.<br>

[0140]  The alternating copolymer SMA 1000P was used as polymeric dispersant DISP-1 to prepare a comparative Inkjet ink.<br>
[0141]  DISP-1 was then used for preparing styrene maleic acid copolymers modified by the chromophores MC-0 and MC-P.<br><br><br>

Synthesis of polymeric dispersant DISP-2<br>
[0152]  Polymeric dispersant DISP-2 was prepared by modifying the polymeric dispersant DISP-1 with the chromophore MC-O.The resulting pending chromophore group PC-0 was linked by C* to the polymeric backbone through a linking group L containing an ester bond.<br><br>
PC-0 Preparation of DISP-2<br>
The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer SMA 1000P was dissolved in DMA (dimethylacetamide) as solvent Then 5 mole% of MC-0, based on the anhydride units in the polymer, was added and the reaction was allowed to continue for 24 hours at room temperature. After 24 hours, the<br><br>
polymer was precipitated with methyl t-butyl ether, isolated by filtration and washed several times with methyl t-butyl ether. The isolated polymer was suspended in water and the pH was adjusted to 10, using 5 N NaOH. The mixture was stirred until the polymer dissolved. Upon complete dissolution, the pH was adjusted to 2, using 6N HCI. The polymeric dispersant was precipitated from the medium, isolated by filtration and dried. The degree of substitution was determined by 1H-NMR-spectroscopy and expressed as the percentage of esterified maleic acid units. The degree of substitution of DISP-2 with the chromophore MC-0 was 1%.<br>
Synthesis of polymeric dispersant DISP-3<br>
[0154]  Polymeric dispersant DISP-3 was prepared by modifying the polymeric dispersant DISP-1 with the chromophore MC-P.The resulting pending chromophore group PC-P was linked by C* to the polymeric backbone through a linking group L containing an ester bond.<br><br>
PC-P Preparation of DiSP-3<br>
The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer SMA 1000P was dissolved in DMA (dimethylacetamide) as solvent. Then 5 mole% of MC-P, based on the anhydride units in the polymer, was added and the reaction was allowed to continue for 24 hours at room temperature. After 24 hours, the polymer was precipitated with methyl t-butyl ether, isolated by filtration and washed several times with methyl t-butyl ether. The isolated polymer was suspended in water and the pH was adjusted to 10, using 5 N NaOH. The mixture was stirred until the polymer dissolved. Upon complete dissolution,<br><br>
the pH was adjusted to 2, using 6N HCI. The polymeric dispersant was precipitated from the medium, isolated by filtration and dried. The degree of substitution was determined by 1H-NMR-spectroscopy and expressed as the percentage of esterified maleic acid units. The degree of substitution of DISP-3 with the chromophore MC-P was 1%, Preparation of inkjet ink<br>
All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 6, except that different pigments and dispersants were used.<br><br>
An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the dispersant and about half of the water with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20g of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth. Under stirring, the surfactant Surfynoi™ 104H and the biocide Proxel™ Ultra 5, glycerol, 1,2-propanediol and the remaining water were added. This mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. The filtration was performed in two steps. First, the ink mixture is filtered using a (plastipak) syringe with a microfiber disposable filtercapsule with 1pm pore diameter (GF/B microfiber from Whatman Inc.) Then the same<br><br>
procedure is repeated on the filtrate. After the second filtration the ink is ready for evaluation.<br>
Using the above method, the comparative Inkjet ink COMP-1 and the inventive Inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-e were prepared according to Table 7.<br><br>
Results and evaluation<br>
The spectral separation factor (SSF) was determined for each sample directly after preparation and was determined again after a severe heat treatment of 1 week at 80**C. The results are listed in Table 8.<br><br>
From Table 8 it is clear that although an altemating polymer was used as the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant, the pigments were dispersed exhibiting a high dispersion quality and a good dispersion stability for the inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0161]  This example illustrates the method for preparing the polymeric<br>
dispersants through uncomplicated synthesis with monomers already containing a chromophore. Since pigments exhibit low solubility in many solvents, this complicates the synthesis of polymeric dispersants, which is not witnessed if a chromophore is used with smaller molecular weight but still exhibiting a resemblance with the pigment.<br>
Chromophore MC-2<br><br>
The formation of the chromophore MC-2 was accomplished by diazotation of compound MC-1D and subsequent coupling in the compound MC-2B. Preparation of chromophore MC-2<br>
29.98 mL (0.36 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to a suspension of 15.3 g (0.1 mol) of compound MC-1D in 300 mL water. This mixture was cooled to a temperature of about 0-5°C and 8.97 g (0.13 mol) of sodiumnitrite was added. The diazonium-salt was kept at a temperature between 0 and 5°C. After 15 minutes the excess of nitrite was neutralized by adding 3.0 g (0.03 mol) of sulfamic acid and a pH of 7 was obtained by adding 25,2 g (0.3 mol) of sodiumcarbonate. While the diazionium-salt was made. 20.7 g (0.1 mol) of MC-2B from ACROS was dissolved in a mixture of 500 mL methanol and 10.0 mL (0.1 mol) 29 % sodiumhydroxide-solution. This solution was added drop-wise into the diazonium-salt solution and a yellow suspension was immediately formed. The temperature was maintained between 0 and 5°C for about 3 hours and the yellow product MC-2 was filtered and washed with methanol. The yield of the chromophore MC-2 was 92 %.
