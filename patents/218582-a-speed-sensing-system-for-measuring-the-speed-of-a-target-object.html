				<td>	The present application is related to, and claims priority from,<br>
	U.S, Provisional Patent Application No. 60/417,839 filed on October 11,<br>
5	2002.<br>
Technical Field<br>
		The present invention relates generally to speed sensors<br>
	configured to monitor the speed of a moving body such as a shaft or<br>
	axle, and in particular, to an improved speed sensing system utilizing a<br>
10.	pair of sensors each configured to detect random targets on a moving<br>
	body, and a signal processor configured to measuring a phase shift<br>
	between each target detection signals, the phase shift proportional to a<br>
	speed of the target.<br>
Background Art<br>
15 		Speed sensing plays an important role in monitoring, and thus<br>
	controlling, machine operations. An accurate and reliable speed sensor<br>
	is critical. Over the years numerous speed-sensing techniques and<br>
	devices have been developed. Mechanical speedometers, electro-<br>
	mechanical speed sensors, magnetic speed sensors, and optical speed<br>
20	sensors are just a few examples. Most popular speed sensing systems<br>
	often include a single sensor, an electronic control unit, and a target<br>
	whose speed relative to the single sensor is measured.<br>
		Depending upon the type of speed being measured, i.e., linear or<br>
	angular speed, and on the sensor technology that is employed, a target<br>
25	may be constructed in a variety of ways and may take many different<br>
	forms. Conventionally, speed sensing targets have been made from<br>
	marked bars and toothed wheels, from multi-polar magnetic-strips and<br>
	magnetic-rings, and from linear and angular bar-encoders. As the target<br>
	moves relative to the sensor, a conventional sensor output signal takes<br>
30	the form of a series of pulses, with the pulse frequency being<br>
	proportional to the target wheel speed.<br><br>
WO 2004/034065 	PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-2-<br>
		The resolution or accuracy of these conventional speed sensing<br>
	systems depend heavily, among other factors, on the accuracy of the<br>
	spacing between the teeth in a toothed target, the spacing of the<br>
	magnetic poles in a magnetic target, and the spacing of the bars in a bar<br>
5	encoder. Thus, or a precision system, a target with high spacing<br>
	accuracy is preferred.<br>
		However, the target manufacturing cost is proportional to the<br>
	target spacing accuracy requirements, and it is not always economical to<br>
	construct a large outer diameter angular target wheel or a long linear<br>
10	target with high spacing accuracy. Accordingly, it would be<br>
	advantageous to introduce a speed sensing system which maintains a<br>
	high degree of speed measurement accuracy without requiring the<br>
	production and application of a precision speed sensing target.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
15		Briefly stated, the present invention sets forth a speed sensor<br>
	system comprising a pair of sensing elements disposed in a directionally<br>
	spaced relationship adjacent a surface of a moving object from which a<br>
	speed measurement will be acquired. A target, having substantially<br>
	random features is disposed on or beneath the surface, and is moved<br>
20	directionally past the pair of sensing elements by the movement of the<br>
	object from which a speed measurement will be acquired. The pair of<br>
	sensing elements are directionally spaced apart by a predetermined<br>
	distance in the direction of the object's movement. Signals from each of<br>
	the pair of sensing elements, generated by the passage of the target,<br>
25	 are conveyed to a signal processor. The signal processor is configured<br>
	to determine a phase shift between the generated signals which is<br>
	inversely proportional to the speed at which the target passed the pair of<br>
	sensor.<br>
		As a method for measuring a target speed, the present invention<br>
30	includes the steps of observing at a first point, a plurality of random<br>
	features of said target, generating a first signal representative of said<br>
	observations at said first point, observing at a second point displaced<br><br>
WO 2004/034065	 PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-3-<br>
	from said first point in a direction of motion of said target, said plurality<br>
	of random features of said target, generating a second signal<br>
	representative of said observations at said second point, and calculating<br>
	a phase shift between said first signal and said second signal, said<br>
5	phase shift inversely proportional to a speed of said target.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
		The following detailed description illustrates the invention by way<br>
5 	of example and not by way of limitation. The description clearly enables<br>
	one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, describes several<br>
	embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives, and uses of the<br>
	invention, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of<br>
	carrying out the invention.<br>
10 		Turning to Figures 1A and 1B, the basic components of a speed<br>
	sensor system 10 of the present invention are shown. A pair of speed<br>
	sensor units 12A and 12B are disposed in a spaced relationship<br>
	adjacent a toothless target surface 14 of a moving object 16, for<br>
	example, the circumferential surface of a bearing race as shown in<br>
15	Figure 1B. Preferably, the speed sensor units 12A and 12B are spaced<br>
	apart by a predetermined distance L between the speed sensor unit<br>
	centers, aligned with the direction of motion of the target surface 14,<br>
	shown by the arrow in Figure 1A. The sensor units 12A and 12B are<br>
	operatively couples to a signal processing unit 18. Preferably, as shown<br>
20	in Figure 1A, the sensor units 12A and 12B are directly coupled to the<br>
	signal processing unit 18 by electrically conductive wires 20 configured<br>
	to communicate respective signals x1 and x2 from the sensor units 12A<br>
	and 12B to the signal processing unit 18. However, those of ordinary<br>
	skill in the art will recognize that a variety of components may be utilized<br>
25	 to couple the sensor units 12A and 12B to the signal processing unit 18,<br>
	including wireless transmission components.<br>
		The operating principles of the current invention are based on<br>
	generating and analyzing two mathematically correlated signals x1 and<br>
	x2 from the pair of sensor units 12A and 12B in the speed sensor system<br>
30	10. By detecting the phase shift between corresponding points in each<br>
	of the two signals x1 and x2, a time delay can be determined. The phase<br>
	variation in signals is solely related to the speed of motion. The speed of<br><br>
WO 2004/034065 	PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-5-<br>
	motion can be calculated as the ratio of the distance L between the<br>
	sensor units 12A and 12B, and the determined time delay.<br>
		For accuracy considerations, it is highly desirable to use random<br>
	signals, each preferably having a high frequency content. To this end, a<br>
5 	target surface 14 with random or near random topographical features<br>
	(roughness) is employed as target to produce randomly variable signals.<br>
	With certain types of sensor units 12A and 12B, such as eddy current<br>
	sensors, the randomness of the signals x1 and x2 can be enriched by<br>
	subsurface material property variations.<br>
10		The first sensing unit 12A and the second sensing unit 12B are<br>
	configured to be substantially sensitive to surface and/or subsurface<br>
	features of the target surface 14, and are functionally similar in that each<br>
	sensor unit 12A, 12B produces identical signals or substantially similar<br>
	signals when passing over the same surface or subsurface features on<br>
15	the target surface 14. Alternative sensor units 12 may include optical<br>
	sensors sensitive to optical variations on the target surface 14.<br>
		As the target surface 14 moves relative to the speed sensor<br>
	system 10, the first sensing unit 12A and the second sensing unit 12B<br>
	each generate signals, such as exemplified in Figure 2A, at an identical<br>
20	 sampling rate f that is substantially higher than the signal variation rate,<br>
	allowing the speed sensing system 10 to resolve high frequency surface<br>
	features even at the highest target speeds.<br>
		In general, a correlation exists between the first signal x1=[x11,<br>
	x12, x13,... x1j, ...,<x1n generated by the first sensing unit and></x1n>
25	second signal x2=[x21, x22, x23,... x2j, ..., x2n] generated by the second<br>
	sensing unit 12B in response to the passage of surface or subsurface<br>
	features on the target surface 14, where n represents the sample size<br>
	(number of data points in a sample). There is, however, a time delay of<br><br>
between the first signal x1 and second signal x2 where m<br>
30	represents the number of shifted data points. The direction of the signal<br><br>
WO 2004/034065 	PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-6-<br>
	shifting corresponds the direction of the motion of the target surface 14<br>
	relative to the sensor units 12A and 12B.<br>
		Thus, a cross correlation function y(τ) between the signals x1 and<br>
	x2 may be defined by the equation:<br>
5<br>
 	Equation (1)<br><br>
		which reaches a maximum value when t τ= Τ0.<br>
		The time delay τ0 can be determined by finding the maximum<br>
	value of the cross correlation function of the signals x1 and x2. That is:<br>
 	Equation (2)<br><br>
10		where ψ is an inverse function to the cross correlation function<br>
	y(τ) defined in Equation (1).<br>
		During operation, signal processor 18 receives and processes<br>
	signals x1 and x2. The incoming signals x1 and x2 are initially processed<br>
	to remove any direct current (DC) components, resulting in a pair of<br>
15	signals each having zero-mean such as shown in Figure 2A. The signal<br>
	processor 18 further performs the cross correlation analysis of the two<br>
	signals, preferably using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based<br>
	algorithm for fast computation. Next, the signal processor 18 determines<br>
	the time delay to between the two signals by calculating the maximum<br>
20	value for the cross correlation function y(τ) defined in Equation (1).<br>
	Finally, the speed of motion v for the target surface 14 past the sensor<br>
	units 12A and 12B is computed by the signal processor 18 as:<br>
 	Equation (3)<br>
		Optionally, the signal processor 18 may be configured to compute<br>
25	a relative position of the target surface 14 by integrating the computed<br>
	speed v with respect to time.<br>
		Returning to Figure 2A, the signals x1 and x2 illustrated<br>
	graphically are representative of signals from a pair of independent eddy<br><br>
WO 2004/034065 	PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-7-<br>
	current speed sensor units 12A and 12B positioned 0.788 inches apart<br>
	along the circumferential direction of motion for a rotating target surface<br>
	14, such as shown in Figure 1B. For a sampling rate of approximately<br>
	48 kHz, the resulting sample size is 3700 data points for a single<br>
5 	revolution of the target surface 14. In the graph shown in Figure 2A, the<br>
	horizontal axis represents sample sequencing and vertical axis is the<br>
	strength of the signals in volts. The cross correlation function of signals<br>
	x1 and x2, illustrated in Figure 2B, identifies a maximum value at data<br>
	point 4036 that corresponds to a shifting of 336 data points (4036-<br>
10	3700=336). The corresponding time delay between the first signal x1<br>
	and second signal x2 is τ0 =336/48000 = 0.007 sec. The surface speed<br>
	of the target 14 is then v = 0.788/0.007 = 112.5 in/sec. The direction of<br>
	motion is determined by the direction of signal shifting.<br>
		Based on the selected sensor technology, the signal processor<br>
15	18 and sensor units 12A, 12B could be integrated into a single unit 20,<br>
	such as shown in Figure 1B using modern ASIC fabrication techniques<br>
	with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) computation ability.<br>
		To ensure a good correlation between the two signals x1 and x2<br>
	under less than ideal installation and/or application conditions,<br>
20	differential sensing combinations of speed sensor units 12 may<br>
	optionally be used. In this case one sensor combination may contain<br>
	more than two speed sensing units 12. A comparison of signals from<br>
	each of the speed sensor units 12 comprising the differential sensing<br>
	combinations permits removal or cancellation of signal components<br>
25	common to all sensing units 12. such as noise or interference, which are<br>
	present at each speed sensor unit location. These common signal<br>
	components usual y carry no information with respect to signal phase<br>
	shifting.<br>
		Figures 3A through 3C illustrate three differential sensing<br>
30	combinations and the positioning of the associated speed sensing units<br>
	12 in relationship to the direction of motion of the target surface 14. In<br>
	Figure 3A. a first sensor combination 100 contains four speed sensor<br><br>
 WO 2004/034065 	PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-8-<br>
	units 12A - 12 D positioned at the corners of a rectangle to form two<br>
	differential sensing pairs. The first differential sensing pair is formed by<br>
	speed sensor units 12A and 12C, and the second differential sensing<br>
	pair is formed by speed sensor units 12B and 12D. In the first differential<br>
5	sensing pair, speed sensor units 12A and 12C are separated by a<br>
	center distance W perpendicular to the direction of motion. In the<br>
	second differentia sensing pair, speed sensor units 12B and 12D are<br>
	similarly separated by the center distance W, perpendicular to the<br>
	direction of motion. Each differential sensing pair is spaced apart by a<br>
10	distance L substantially in the direction of motion.<br>
		Figure 3B illustrates an alternate arrangement for a sensing<br>
	system 200 wherein the differential sensing pairs 12A, 12C and 12B,<br>
	12D are disposed at the corners of a parallelogram, i.e., where the<br>
	center lines between speed sensor units 12A and 12C and between<br>
15	 speed sensor units 12B and 12D are not perpendicular to the center line<br>
	defined by the position of speed sensor units 12A and 12B. The<br>
	included angle α between speed sensor units 12A, 12C and speed<br>
	sensor units 12A, 12B is set equal to the included angle β between<br>
	speed sensor unite 12B, 12D and speed sensor units 12A, 12B. That is<br>
20	 α = β, such that the placement of the speed sensor units 12A - 12D<br>
	defines a parallelogram having two sides parallel to the direction of<br>
	motion of the target surface 14. In general, α and β could each vary<br>
	from 0 to 360 degrees.<br>
		Figure 3C shows an alternate arrangement for a sensing system<br>
25	 300 similar to that shown in Figure 3A, but where the first pair of<br>
	differential sensing units 12 A, 12C and the second pair of differential<br>
	sensing units 12B, 12D are disposed in two different sensor housings,<br>
	and hence are spaced apart by a distance L' &gt; L. As is shown in Figure<br>
	3A. the centerline between the centers of sensing elements 12A and<br>
30	 12B substantially aligns with the direction of motion of the target surface<br>
	14. Corresponding y, the center line that connects the centers of the<br><br>
WO 2004/034065	 PCT/US2003/031601<br>
-9-<br>
	sensing elements 12C and 12D is also substantially aligned with the<br>
	direction of motion. The center lines connecting the centers of the first<br>
	pair of differential sensing units 12A, 12C is parallel with the center line<br>
	that connects the centers of the second pair of differential sensing units<br>
5 	12B, 12D, and substantially perpendicular to the direction of motion for<br>
	the target surface 14.<br>
		The current invention is not confined to any specific type of speed<br>
	sensors units. However, the speed sensor units 12 are preferably eddy<br>
	current sensors capable of generating signal variations induced both by<br>
10	topographical features on the target surface 14 and by subsurface<br>
	material property changes in the target object 16. This allows the<br>
	sensing system to be used not only for rough target surfaces 14 but also<br>
	for smooth target surfaces 14 where the signal variation is induced<br>
	primarily by subsurface material property changes rather than by surface<br>
15	 topographical features.<br>
		Figure 4 graphically illustrates the validity of the sensing system<br>
10	 and techniques of the present invention in measuring angular speed<br>
	using a pair of eddy current speed sensor units 12A, 12B and a<br>
	toothless target object 16. The graph of Figure 4 plots the angular speed<br>
20	 of the target object 16 as measured by the sensing system 10 of the<br>
	present invention versus the angular speed of the target object 16 as<br>
	measured by a conventional variable reluctance (VR) speed sensor<br>
	system, illustrating a close correlation between the two sensor systems.<br>
		It should be understood that the sensing system 10 and<br>
25	 techniques of the present invention are applicable to a host of<br>
	applications such as for use in bearing application, and particularly in<br>
	bearing applications wherein the target surface 14 is a bearing seal.<br>
		In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the<br>
	invention are achieved and other advantageous results are obtained. As<br>
30	various changes could be made in the above constructions without<br>
	departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter<br><br>

AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
A method and apparatus for measuring the<br>
speed of a target object passing a pair of sensor units (12)<br>
displaced apart by a predetermined distant L in the direction<br>
of motion of the target object (16). Passage of one or more<br>
features of the target object (16) past the first sensor unit<br>
(12A) results in the generation of a signal (x1), and passage<br>
of the same feature of the target object (16) past the second<br>
sensor unit (12B) results in the generate of a second signal,<br>
(x2). A signal processor (18) is configured to determine a<br>
mathematical correlation between signals (x1) and (x2), and<br>
an associated time delay (τ0). The speed (v) of the target<br>
object (16) is calculated by the signal processor (18) as the<br>
ratio of the predetermined distance (L) to the time delay (10).<br></td>
