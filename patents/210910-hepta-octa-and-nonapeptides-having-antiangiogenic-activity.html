COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
Section 10<br>
Hepta-Octa- and Nonapeptides having antiangiogenic activity<br>
Abbott Laboratories, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of USA, of Dept. 377 BIdg Ap6A-1, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-6008 USA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
255/MUMNP/2004<br>
   31/10/2004<br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to hepta-, octa- and nanopeptides having antiangiogenic activity which can be used for inhibiting angiogenesis and consequently for the treatment of cancer and other conditions arising from or exacerbated by angiogenesis. Pharmaceutical compositions describing the peptides are also disclosed.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Angiogenesis is the fundamental process by which new blood vessels are formed and is essential to a variety of normal body activities (such as reproduction, development and wound repair). Although the process is not completely understood, it is believed to involve a complex interplay of molecules which both stimulate and inhibit the growth of endothelial cells, the primary cells of the capillary blood vessels. Under normal conditions these molecules appear to maintain the 20 microvasculature in a quiescent state (i.e., one of no capillary growth) for prolonged periods that may last for weeks, or in some cases, decades. However, when necessary, such as during wound repair, these same cells can undergo rapid proliferation and turnover within as little as five days.<br>
Although angiogenesis is a highly regulated process under normal conditions, many diseases (characterized as "angiogenic diseases") are driven by persistent unregulated angiogenesis.<br>
Otherwise stated, unregulated angiogenesis may either cause a particular disease directly or exacerbate an existing pathological condition. For example, the growth and metastasis of solid tumors have been shown to be angiogenesis-dependent. Based on these findings, there is a continuing need for compounds which demonstrate antiangiogenic activity due to their potential use in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer. Peptides having angiogenesis  inhibiting 30 properties have been described in commonly-owned WO01/38397, WO01/38347, W099/61476, and U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 09/915,956. However, it would be desirable to prepare antiangiogenic compounds having improved profiles of activity and smaller size.<br>

residues used herein follow the naming conventions suggested by the IUPAC Commission on the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry and the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature as set out in "Nomenclature of a-Amino Acids (Recommendations, 1974) " Biochemistry, 14(2), (1975). To the extent that the names and abbreviations of amino acids and<br>
10     aminoacyl residues employed in this specification and appended claims differ from those<br>
suggestions, they will be made clear to the reader. Some abbreviations useful in describing the invention are defined below in the following Table 1.<br>
. Table 1<br><br><br><br>
When not found in the table above, nomenclature and abbreviations may be further clarified by reference to the Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. 1999 Catalog and Peptide Synthesis Handbook or the Chem-Impex International, Inc. Tools for Peptide &amp; Solid Phase Synthesis 1998-1999 5      Catalogue.<br>
Compositions<br><br>
The compounds of the invention, including not limited to those specified in the examples, possess anti-angiogenic activity. As angiogenesis inhibitors, such compounds are useful in the treatment of both primary and metastatic solid tumors, including carcinomas of breast, colon, rectum, lung, oropharynx, hypopharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and bile 5     ducts, small intestine, urinary tract (including kidney, bladder and urothelium), female genital tract (including cervix, uterus, and ovaries as well as choriocarcinoma and gestational trophoblastic disease), male genital tract (including prostate, seminal vesicles, testes and genu cell tumors), endocrine glands (including the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands), and skin, as well as hemangiomas, melanomas, sarcomas (including those arising from bone and soft tissues as well as<br>
10     Kaposi's sarcoma) and tumors of the brain, nerves, eyes, and meninges (including astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas, retinoblastomas, neuromas, neuroblastomas, Schwannomas, and meningiomas). Such compounds may also be useful in treating solid tumors arising from hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemias (i.e., chloromas, plasmacytomas and the plaques and tumors of mycosis fungosides and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia) as well as in the treatment<br>
15      of lymphomas (both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). In addition, these compounds may be useful in the prevention of metastases from the tumors described above either when used alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or other chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
Further uses include the treatment and prophylaxis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid, immune and degenerative arthritis; various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy,<br>
20     retinopathy of prematurity, corneal graft rejection, retrolental fibroplasia, neovascular glaucoma, rubeosis, retinal neovascularization due to macular degeneration, hypoxia, angiogenesis in the eye associated with infection or surgical intervention, and other abnormal neovascularization conditions of the eye; skin diseases such as psoriasis; blood vessel diseases such as hemagiomas, and capillary proliferation within atherosclerotic plaques; Osier-Webber Syndrome; myocardial angiogenesis;<br>
25      plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma; and wound granulation. Other uses include the treatment of diseases characterized by excessive or abnormal stimulation of endothelial cells, including not limited to intestinal adhesions, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, scleroderma, and hypertrophic scars (i.e., keloids). Another use is as a birth control agent, by inhibiting ovulation and establishment of the placenta. The compounds of the invention are also<br>
30      useful in the treatment of diseases that have angiogenesis as a pathologic consequence such as cat scratch disease (Rochele minulesalia quintosd) and ulcers {Helicobacterpylori). The compounds of the invention are also useful to reduce bleeding by administration prior to surgery, especially for the treatment of resectable tumors.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with other compositions and<br>
35      procedures for the treatment of diseases. For example, a tumor may be treated conventionally with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy combined with a peptide of the present invention and then a peptide of the present invention may be subsequently administered to the patient to extend the dormancy of micrometastases and to stabilize and inhibit the growth of any residual primary tumor. Additionally, the compounds of the invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
 excipients, and optionally sustained-release matrices, such as biodegradable polymers, to form therapeutic compositions.<br>
A sustained-release matrix, as used herein, is a matrix made of materials, usually polymers, which are degradable by enzymatic or acid-base hydrolysis or by dissolution. Once inserted into the 5     body, the matrix is acted upon by enzymes and body fluids. A sustained-release matrix desirably is chosen from biocompatible materials such as liposomes, polylactides (polylactic acid), polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid), polylactide co-glycolide (copolymersof lactic acid and glycolic acid) polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chondroitin sulfate, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, phospholipids, polysaccharides, nucleic acids,<br>
10     polyamino acids, amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, polynucleotides, polyvinyl propylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone and silicone. A preferred biodegradable matrix is a matrix of one of either polylactide, polyglycolide, or polylactide co-glycolide (co-polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid).<br>
When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the<br>
15     compounds of the present invention may be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. By a "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat an angiogenic disease, (for example, to limit tumor growth or to slow or block tumor metastasis) at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage<br>
20     of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending<br>
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
25     administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidential with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
30	Alternatively, a compound of the present invention may be administered as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient refers to a non-toxic solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The compositions may be administered parenterally, intracisternally, htravaginally,<br>
35      intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), rectally, or bucally. The term "parenteral" as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
40      sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile<br><br>
powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and 5      injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be<br>
10     ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
15	Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in<br>
biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters), poly(anhydrides), and (poly)glycols, such as PEG. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are<br>
20     compatible with body tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Topical administration includes administration to the skin or mucosa, including surfaces of<br>
25     the lung and eye. Compositions for topical administration, including those for inhalation, may be prepared as a dry powder which may be pressurized or non-pressurized. In non-pressurized powder compositions, the active ingredient in finely divided form may be used in admixture with a larger-sized pharmaceutically-acceptable inert carrier comprising particles having a size, for example, of up to 100 micrometers in diameter. Suitable inert carriers include sugars such as lactose. Desirably,<br>

Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically-acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of<br>
15     forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like.

Determination of Biological Activity In Vitro Assay for Angiogenic Activity<br>
The human microvascular endothelial (HMVEC) migration assay was run according to the procedure of S. S. Tolsma, O. V. Volpert, D. J. Good, W. F. Frazier, P. J. Polverini and N. Bouck, J.<br>
10     Cell Biol. 1993,122, 497-511.<br>
The HMVEC migration assay was carried out using Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells-Dermal (single donor) and Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells, (neonatal). The HMVEC cells were starved overnight in DME containing 0.01% bovine serum albuminutes (BSA). Cells were then harvested with trypsin and resuspended in DME with 0.01% BSA at a concentration of<br>
15      1.5 X 106 cells per mL. Cells were added to the bottom of a 48 well modified Boyden chamber (Nucleopore Corporation, Cabin John, MD). The chamber was assembled and inverted, and cells were allowed to attach for 2 hours at 37 °C to polycarbonate chemotaxis membranes (5|im pore size) that had been soaked in 0.01% gelatin overnight and dried. The chamber was then reinverted, and test substances (total volume of 50 uL), including activators, 15 ng/mL bFGF/VEGF, were<br>
20     added to the wells of the upper chamber. The apparatus was incubated for 4 hours at 37 °C.<br>
Membranes were recovered, fixed and stained (Diff Quick, Fisher Scientific) and the number of cells that had migrated to the upper chamber per 3 high power fields counted. Background migration to DME + 0.1 BSA was subtracted and the data reported as the number of cells migrated per 10 high power fields (400X) or, when results from multiple experiments were combined, as the<br>
25     percent inhibition of migration compared to a positive control.<br>
Representative compounds inhibited human endothelial cell migration in the above assay by at least 50% when tested at a concentration of 1 nM. Preferred compounds inhibited human endothelial cell migration by approximately 65% to 90% when tested at a concentration of 1 nM and most preferred compounds inhibited human endothelial cell migration by approximately 50% to<br>
30     95% at a concentration of 0.1 nM. As shown by these results, the compounds of the present invention demonstate enhanced potency.<br>
Synthesis of the Peptides<br>
This invention is intended to encompass compounds having formula (I) when prepared by 35      synthetic processes or by metabolic processes. Preparation of the compounds of the invention by metabolic processes include those occurring in the human or animal body (in vivo) or processes occurring in vitro.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention may be synthesized by many techniques that are known to those skilled in the art. For solid phase peptide synthesis, a summary of the many 40      techniques may be found in J.M. Stewart and J.D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, W.H.<br><br>
Freeman Co. (San Francisco), 1963 and J. Meienhofer, Hormonal Proteins and Peptides, vol. 2, p. 46, Academic Press (New York), 1973. For classical solution synthesis see G. Schroder and K. Lupke, The Peptides, vol. 1, Academic Press ("New York), 1965.<br>
Reagents, resins, amino acids, and amino acid derivatives are commercially available and 5     can be purchased from Chem-Impex International, Inc. (Wood Dale, IL, U.S.A.) or Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) unless otherwise noted herein.<br>
In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids or suitably protected amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or<br>
10     derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complimentary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected, under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth. After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the<br>
15      proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups (and any solid support) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to afford the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling (under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers) a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide.<br>
20	A particularly preferred method of preparing compounds of the present invention involves<br>
solid phase peptide synthesis. In this particularly preferred method the ot-amino function is protected by an acid or base sensitive group. Such protecting groups should have the properties of being stable to the conditions of peptide linkage formation, while being readily removable without destruction of the growing peptide chain or racemization of any of the chiral centers contained<br>
25     therein. Suitable protecting groups are 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyioxycarbonyi (Cbz), biphenyiisopropyi-oxycarbonyi, t-amyioxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, (a,a)-dimethyl-3,5-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, O-nitrophenylsulfenyl, 2-cyano-t-butyloxycarbonyl, and the like. The 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group is preferred.<br>
30	Particularly preferred side chain protecting groups are: for arginine: 2,2,5,7,8-<br>
pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl (Pmc), and 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-S-sulfonyl (Pbf); for asparagine: trityl (Trt); for aspartic acid: t-buyl (t-Bu); for glutamine: trityl (Trt); for N-methylglutamic acid: t-butyl (t-Bu); for histidine: trityl (Trt); for lysine: t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc); for seryl: t-butyl (t-Bu); for threonine and allothreonine: t-butyl (t-Bu); for tryptophan: t-<br>
35      butoxycarbonyl (Boc); and for tyrosine: t-butyl (t-Bu).<br>
In the solid phase peptide synthesis method, the C-terminal amino acid is attached to a suitable solid support or resin. Suitable solid supports useful for the above synthesis are those materials which are inert lo the reagents and reaction conditions of the stepwise condensation-deprotection reactions, as well as being insoluble in the media used. The preferred solid support for<br>
40      synthesis of C-terminal carboxyl peptides is Sieber amide resin or Sieber ethylamide resin. The<br><br>
preferred solid support for C-terminal amide peptides is Sieber ethylamide resin available from Novabiochem Corporation.<br>
The C-terminal amino acid is coupled to the resin by means of a coupling mediated by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (D1C), [0-(7-azabenzotriazoI-l-5     y I)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate] (HATU), or 0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate (HBTU), with or without 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium-hexafJuorophosphate (BOP) or bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphine chloride (BOPC1), for about 1 to about 24 hours at a temperature of between<br>
10      10 °C and 50 °C in a solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF.<br>
When the solid support is Sieber amide or Sieber ethylamide resin, the Fmoc group is cleaved with a secondary amine, preferably piperidine, prior to coupling with the C-terminal amino acid as described above. The preferred reagents used in the coupling to the deprotected 4-(2',4'-dimethoxyphenyI-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxyacetamidoethyl resin are O-benzotriazoi-i-yl-<br>
15 N,N,N\N'-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate(HBTU, 1 equiv.) with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, 1 equiv.), or [0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate] (HATU, 1 equiv.) with N-methylmorpholine (1 equiv.) in DMF.<br>
The coupling of successive protected amino acids can be carried out in an automatic polypeptide synthesizer as is well known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, thea-amino<br>
20     function in the amino acids of the growing peptide chain are protected with Fmoc. The removal of the Fmoc protecting group from the N-terminal side of the growing peptide is accomplished by treatment with a secondary amine, preferably piperidine. Each protected amino acid is then introduced in about 3-fold molar excess and the coupling is preferably carried out in DMF. The coupling agent is normally 0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate<br>
25 (HBTU, I equiv.) or [
At the end of the solid phase synthesis, the polypeptide is removed from the resin and deprotected, either in succession or in a single operation. Removal of the polypeptide and deprotection can be accomplished in a single operation by treating the resin-bound polypeptide with<br>
30     a cleavage reagent, for example trifluoroacetic acid containing thianisole, water, or ethanedithiol. In cases where the C-terminus of the polypeptide is an alky lam ide, the resin is cleaved by aminolysis with an alkylamine. Alternatively, the peptide may be removed by transesterification, e.g. with methanol, followed by aminolysis or by direct transamidation. The protected peptide may be purified at this point or taken to the next step directly. The removal of the side chain protecting<br>
35      groups is accomplished using the cleavage cocktail described above.<br>
The fully deprotected peptide is purified by a sequence of chromatographic steps employing any or all of the following types: ion exchange on a weakly basic resin in the acetate form; hydrophobic adsorption chromatography on underivitized polystyrene-divinylbenzene (for example, AMBERLITE   XAD); silica gel adsorption chromatography; ion exchange chromatography on<br>
40     carboxymethylcellulose; partition chromatography, e.g., on SEPHADEX* C-25, LH-20 or<br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
countercurrent distribution; high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), especially reverse-phase HPLC on octyl- oroctadecylsilyl-silica bonded phase column packing.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood in light of the examples which are meant to describe compounds and process which can be carried out in accordance with the invention and are not intended as a limitation on the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Abbreviations which have been used the following examples are: DMF for N,N-dimethylformamide; HBTU forO-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N*-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate; NMM for N-methylmorpholine; and TFA for trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
