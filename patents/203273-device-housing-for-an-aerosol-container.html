DEVICE   HOUSING   FOK   AN   AEROSOL   CONTAINER Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a housing for a mechanical or electrical device which is joinable to a collar affixed around the nec!
Background to the Invention<br>
Aerosol canisters are widely used in domestic, commercial and industrial situations for the application of a range of chemicals. Typical examples of chemical products which are dispensable in this way include cosmetics, health products, paints, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Frequently there is a need to attach mechanical or electrical devices to such aerosol canisters, for example to regulate or record the flow of chemical from the canister, or to act as environmental sensors. Such devices may be affixed to the canisters by a range of technologies including the use of adhesives and heat treatment, such as soldering or welding. However, the attachment of such devices to aerosol canisters poses difficulties in terms of producing a secure joint without affecting the integrity of the chemical by the application of excess heat during the heating or welding process. Similarly, the use of adhesives may lead to contamination problems due to the presence of low concentrations of volatiles from the adhesive on dispensing the chemical.<br>
Medicament dispensers are extensively used in the administration of medicines, particularly those for the treatment of respiratory disorders.  Medicaments which are<br><br>
2<br>
contained in an aerosol and are administered to a patient by means of an inhalation device are widely used in such therapy. These inhalation devices typically comprise a tubular housing or sleeve in which the aerosol canister is located and an outlet tube leading from the housing. The aerosol canisters used in such inhalation devices are designed to deliver a predetermined dose of medicament upon actuation; the valves can be opened either by depression of the valve member itself or by depression of the canister while the valve member is held stationary. In the use of such devices, the aerosol canister is placed in the tubular housing with the outlet valve member of the canister communicating via a support with the outlet tube, for example a nozzle or mouthpiece.<br>
A recent development in this field of technology is the use of meohanical or electrical dose counters to registerihe number of medicament doses used or remaining within the medicament dispenser. Dose counters can be positioned within the tubular housing and operate by means of detecting movement of the housing relative to the aerosol canister on actuation of the dispenser by the patient. The indexing mechanism of the dose counter registers the actuation of the dispenser and the counter displays how many doses have been used or remain within the aerosol canister.<br>
Some dose counters are detachable from the aerosol dispenser. One disadvantage of such devices Is that the individual components may become separated and used In isolation from each other. Another disadvantage of these devices is that once the dose counter is removed from the aerosol canister it may be tampered with, typically by young children, to give a false reading. Detachment of the dose counter from the aerosol canister could therefore result in false readings on re-attachment to the canister. Furthermore, with patients having several different inhalers, the indicating device could be re-attached to the wrong dispenser.<br>
Other dose counters are essentially irreversibly attached to the aerosol dispenser. One means of affixing dose counters to aerosol canisters is to use a 'snap-fit'<br><br>
10<br><br>
3<br>
mechanism whereby a tubular grip assembly on the dose counter housing is pushed into position around the neck of the valve ferrule thereby locking the two components together. Whilst this arrangement holds the two structures securely together there can, on occasions, be some lateral movement or 'play' of one component relative to the other. As mechanical dose counters operate by registering relative movement of the aerosol canister to the dose counter housing, any play or lateral movement can result in false readings being registered on the dose counter. A key factor in the successful operation and functioning of such dose counters is that there be minimal movement of the housing relative to the aerosol canister outwith the actuation cycle.<br>
Dimensional variation resulting from manufacturing tolerances of aerosol canisters and dose counter housings poses additional problems in the assembly and operation of medicament dispensers. In order that the dose indicator mechanism functions correctly the canister and the counter housing, must fit together tightly. Thus any variations in the dimensions of either of these components which result in a loose fit between the counter housing and the canister can lead to increased relative movement and the problems of false readings discussed above.<br>
To overcome these problems of dimensional variation, stringent tolerance levels must be set for the manufacture of both the counter housing and the aerosol canister. This approach, together with the high levels of quality control necessary to ensure that both components meet the required engineering standards, is expensive for the manufacturer.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to address the aforementioned problems associated with attachment of a mechanical or electrical device to an aerosol canister, in particular for the attachment of a dose counter housing thereto. The present invention involves joining the device housing to a ring or collar affixed around the neck of an aerosol canister to minimise the relative movement of the component parts. This joining can be achieved by a variety of technologies, including melting the components together by means of 'hot staking', soldering the<br><br>
4<br>
surfaces together, or using adhesives to bind the housing to the collar.   Welding technologies are particularly well suited for this purpose.<br>

Brief Description of Drawings<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a section through a standard metered dose inhalation device.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of a section through an aerosol canister affixed to a housing according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic representation of a medical dispenser according to the present invention.<br>
Figures 4a - c is a schematic illustration of the process whereby a dose counter housing is secured to a standard metered dose inhalation device by ultrasound welding.<br>
Figures 5a &amp; b show a housing for a transceiver affixed to an aerosol container and a cross section of the housing according to the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Drawings<br>
The standard metered dose inhaler shown in Fig 1 comprises a housing 10 in which an aerosol canister 20 can be located. The housing is open at one end (which will hereinafter be considered to be the top of the device for convenience of description) and is closed at the other. An outlet 30 leads laterally from the closed end of the housing 10.    In the embodiment illustrated, the outlet 30 is in the form of a<br><br>
10<br>
mouthpiece intended for insertion into the mouth of the patient but it may, if desired, be designed as a nozzle for insertion into the patient's nostril.<br>
The aerosol canister 20, comprising a neck region 21 and ferrule 22, has an outlet valve stem 40 at one end. This valve member can be depressed to release a measured dose from the aerosol canister or, alternatively, the valve stem 40 can be fixed and the main body of the canister can be moved relative to the valve member to release the dose.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the aerosol canister 20 is located in the housing 10 so that one end protrudes from its open top, the canister being positioned such that the neck 21 and valve ferrule 22 are enclosed within housing 10. Spacer ribs (not shown) may be provided inside the housing to hold the external surface of the canister 20 spaced from the internal surface of the housing 10. A support 50 is provided at the lower end of the housing 10 and has a passage 60 in which the valve stem 40 of the aerosol canister 20 can be located and supported. A second passage 70 is provided in the support 50 and Is directed towards the interior of the outlet 30. Thus, when the parts are in the positions shown in Figure 1, the protruding portion of the aerosol canister 20 can be depressed to move the canister relative to the valve stem 40 to open the valve and a dose of medicament contained in the aerosol will be discharged through the passage 70 and into the outlet 30 from which it can be inhaled by a patient. One dose will be released from the aerosol canister each time it is fully depressed.<br>
Figure 2 Is a schematic diagram showing a housing for a dose indicating device 100 (internal details not shown) connected to an aerosol canister 120 according to the present invention. The housing comprises a cradle 101 for supporting the counter mechanism, located within the body of the counter (details not shown), and a housing 100 having a tubular sleeve 102 to receive aerosol canister 120 and valve stem 140. Collar 125, which is typically a split ring, is secured around the neck 121 of the aerosol canister 120.   Tubular sleeve 102 fits over valve ferrule 122 and<br><br>
11<br>
engages collar 125 which is tightly affixed around neck 121 of aerosol canister 120. Thus the tubular sleeve 102 and collar 125 form a tight connection between housing 100 and aerosol canister 120. Collar 125 is welded to sleeve 102 by application of ultrasound energy. The sleeve 102 is secured to the collar 125 by a series of spot welds 180. Two sonitrodes (not shown) are generally employed in the welding process, each sonitrode having three pins which are pushed into contact with the sleeve 102. Energy is transferred through the sonitrode pins, causing them to vibrate and fusing the sleeve 102 to the collar 125. The vibrating pins are pushed through the sleeve 102 to a depth of approximately 2mm into the body of the collar 125, melting and fusing the materials together, to form a series of spot welds. In an alternative herein, one continuous weld may be employed by either moving the sonitrode head around the sleeve or vice versa.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram showing the lower part of a device similar to that of Figure 1 but incorporating the housing for a dose indicating device'200 affixed to an aerosol canister according to the invention as shown in Figure 2. The counter mechanism (not shown) is supported on a cradle 201 and engages post 218. Ultrasound welds 280 secure collar 225 around neck 221 of canister 220 to tubular sleeve 202, thereby affixing aerosol canister 220 to dose counter housing 200. The resulting assembly is positioned within housing 210. Thus on depression of the aerosol canister 220, the canister moves relative to the valve stem 240 and opens the canister valve (not shown) to discharge a predetermined dose of medicament to the patient through valve stem 240 and thence to outlet 230. The relative movement of canister 220 to counter housing 200 is registered by the counter mechanism (not shown) and the number of doses of medicament used or remaining within canister 220 is displayed on counter window 205 and can be viewed through housing window 215.<br>
Figures 4a - c illustrate, with another embodiment of the present invention, the process whereby the collar 325 is fitted around neck 321 of the canister 320 and welded to tubular sleeve 302 of the dose counter housing 300.   Figure 4a is an<br><br>
12<br>
exploded diagram showing collar 325 being positioned between canister 320 and dose counter housing 300 displaying counter window 305. The collar 325 is slipped around neck 321 of canister 320 (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4c, the collar 325 is then pushed in the direction of arrow A to locate against the base of ferrule 322 at the top of neck 321, while dose counter housing 300 is positioned over the top of canister 320 by being pressed down in the direction of arrow B. In this way, collar 325 is wedged between tubular sleeve 302 and the neck of canister 321. The collar 325 is joined to tubular sleeve 302 by ultra sound welding at the points indicated by arrows C, thereby securing the dose counter housing 300 to canister 320.<br>
Figures 5a and 5b show a housing 400 for a passive transceiver in the form of an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) chip 490. In Figure 5a the housing 400 is welded at points 480 to collar 425 (not shown) which has been secured to the neck 421 of the aerosol canister 420 having outlet 440 as described above. The chip 490, located within housing 400, communicates with electrical contact pad 495. Figure 5b is a cut-away section of Figure 5a, the aerosol canister having been removed to show collar 425 welded to housing 400. In this sectional view, EEPROM chip 490 and electrical contact pad 495 are clearly shown.<br>
Whilst the present invention has been described in detail in respect of a metered dose inhaler it will be appreciated that other mechanical and electronic devices, such as electronic sensors and readers, may be attached to an aerosol canister in an identical manner. For example, a temperature/pressure sensor for use with a paint dispenser could also be affixed to the aerosol canister in this way.<br>
It may be appreciated that any of the parts of the dispenser which contact the chemical suspension may be coated with materials such as fluoropolymer materials which reduce the tendency of chemical to adhere thereto. Any movable parts may also have coatings applied thereto which enhance their desired movement characteristics. Frictional coatings may therefore be applied to enhance frictional contact and lubricants used to reduce frictional contact as necessary.<br><br>
13<br>

Appropriate medicaments may thus be selected from, for example, analgesics, e.g., codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine; anginal preparations, e.g., diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g., cromoglycate (e.g. s the sodium salt), ketotifen or nedocromil (e.g. as the sodium salt); antiinfectives e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g., methapyrilene; antiinflammatories, e.g., beclomethasone (e.g. as the dipropionate ester), fluticasone (e.g. as the propionate ester), flunisolide, budesonide, rofleponide, mometasone e.g. as the furcate ester), ciclesonide, triamcinolone (e.g. as the acetonide) or 6a, 9a-difluoro-11 ?-hydroxy-16?-methyl-3-oxo-17?-propionyIoxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17 ?-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl) ester; antitussives, e.g., noscapine; bronchodilators, e.g., albuterol (e.g. as free base or sulphate), salmeterol (e.g. as xinafoate), ephedrine, adrenaline, fenoterol (e.g. as hydrobromide), formoterol (e.g. as fumarate), isoprenaline, metaproterenol, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol (e.g. as acetate), reproterol (e.g. as hydrochloride), rimiterol, terbutaline (e.g. as sulphate), isoetharine, tulobuterol or 4-hydroxy-7-[2-[[2-[[3-(2-phenylethoxy)propyl]sulfonyl]ethyl]amino]ethyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolone; adenosine 2a agonists, e.g. 2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-[6-Amlno-2-(1S-hydroxymethyl-2-phenyl-ethylamino)-purin-9-yl]-5-(2-ethyI-2H-tetrazoI-5-yl)-tetrahydro-furan-3,4-diol (e.g. as maleate); a4 integrin inhibitors e.g. (2S)-3-[4-({[4-(aminocarbonyl)-1-piperidinyl] carbonyi}oxy)phenyl]-2-[((2S)-4-methyi-2-{[2-(2-methylphenoxy) acetyl]amino}pentanoyl)amino] propanoic acid (e.g. as free acid or potassium salt), diuretics, e.g., amiloride; anticholinergics, e.g., ipratropium (e.g. as bromide), tiotropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones, e.g., cortisone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone; xanthines, e.g., aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine theophyllinate or theophylline; therapeutic proteins and peptides, e.g., insulin or glucagon; vaccines, diagnostics and gene therapies. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the medicaments may be used in the form<br><br>
14<br>
of salts, (e.g., as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g., lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g., hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability of ihe medicament and/or to minimise the solubility of the medicament in the propellant.
