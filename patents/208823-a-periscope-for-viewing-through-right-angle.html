TITLE<br>
A PERISCOPE FOR VIEWING THROUGH RIGHT ANGLE .<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Ingole Vijay Tulshiram and Ingole Ashutosh Vijay both Indian Citizens of 104, Ganediwal Layout Camp,<br>
Amravati-444602, Maharashtra, India.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
The present invention relates to a new periscope. More particularly this invention relates to a periscope for viewing objects or events through right angle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Periscopes are generally used in order to overcome obstructions appearing along the line of vision and to facilitate a proper viewing with parallel beam of light rays. Periscopes have wide applications in submarines and in the battlefields where objects above or behind having obstructions in direct viewing are to be observed without physically changing the viewers' positon. Periscopes have also applications in aquatic games where objects above water level or below are to be seen. Generally all such periscopes are designed for viewing parallel rays of light generally having two reflectors for composing a true image.<br>
It is known that the view angle of a human eye is limited and whenever one desires to see objects or events not exactly in alignment with the eye, one has to bend or turn the eye ball and/or the neck. In many situations while lying in supine position it becomes uncomfortable, if not imposible to bend the neck to observe events occuring in horizontal direction such as: bed ridden patients, soldiers in the field lying in supine position for security reasons.<br><br>
Even bay-watchers lying in supine position may desire to keep vigil or enjoy scenery and more so for star gazers in standing or erect position desiring to observe the objects directly above the head. When one desires to study written or printed materials in lying position, it becomes tiresome to keep the neck and hands in lifted posture.<br>
There has therefore been a long felt need	to provide	a<br>
solution  to  all  such problems where  either  for	comforts	or<br>
convenience  and/or  security  reasons,  the  views	need  to	be<br>
reflected without distortion, by right angle.<br>
A new periscope for viewing through right angle comprises a device for reflecting objects or even specifically by right angle but generally by extended angle with a perception of a true image. The device comprises an enclosure with coupling or provision for attachment, or it may form an integral part of any mask, binocular, spectacles or any external eye wear. The said enclosure comprises a object mirror disposed in front of window opening and an eye mirrordisposed in front of another window opening for the eyes of the viewers. The said window openings are substantially placed at a right angle. The eye mirror further comprises a mechanism to change the orientation by bending the light rays coming from the object or event through right angle. The angle between the said object reflector or mirror and  object<br><br>
or scenery as well as the angle between and said eye reflector or mirror are designed so as to reflect the incoming light rays from the object thereby bending them generally through right angle and further in this process the light coming from the objects reflected twice thereby creating a true perception of image aligned with the line of viewers. When the periscope is viewed through the said eye mirror window opening, the user can observe true vision of events perpendicular to the line of sight of the eye.<br>
The invented compact and light weight periscope provides a simple solution to problems referred herein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a new periscope for viewing through right angle comprising a device for reflecting object or event generally by extended angle but specifically by right angle with a perception of a true image and an enclosure means with coupling for attachment or to be an integral part of any mask, binocular, spectacle or any external eye wear and means to protect and avoid unwanted stray light from entering inside the device. The periscope further comprises plurality of mirrors or reflector, hereinafter referred to as reflector, object-reflectors disposed in front of plurality of window openings means for accepting the light rays from the object or event under<br><br>
observation and placed at a typical angle with respect to the incoming light rays reflecting the said light on plurality of eye reflectors disposed in front of a plurality of window openings for receiving the said rays of light reflected from the said object reflectors and the said eye reflectors are placed at a typical angle to reflect the said rays of light from the said object reflectors means coming from the object or event for viewing by the users and the said window openings object window opening and eye window Openings generally placed at a right angle to facilitate unobstructed right angled path for the said rays of light coming from the object or event under observation and further the angle between the said object reflectors and said eye reflectors,' is designed to reflect the incoming light ray from the object, the combine action of the said reflectors, for bending them generally through right angle and further said light rays coming from the objects first reflect. over said object reflector thereby bending them in the direction towards said eye reflector means for further reflecting the said light rays towards the eyes of the user. The said light rays coming from the object or event thus reflects twice means first over said object-reflector and then over the said eye reflectors thereby composing or creating a true perception of object image and thereby when the periscope is viewed through the eye reflector window opening, the user can see events perpendicular to the line of sight of the eye and alternatively the said eye reflectors may further consist<br><br>
of a mechanism means adjustable arrangement means for changing the reflecting or bending angle means other than right angle, of the object or event.<br>
This has heretofore not been achievable with prior periscopes. The periscope for viewing through right angle under disclosure provided in accordance with the present invention solves a long-felt need in the art for periscope which have a simple construction and light weight and eliminates the need for bending neck and/or eye sockets to view object or event at right-angle to the line of sight thereby rendering them very convenient and useful for patients who have to lie in supine position, soldiers in the field, bay-watchers desiring to see events occuring in horizontal direction; star gazers in standing or erect posture desire to see things directly above and for user to study written or printed material in supine position.<br>
These and other advantages will be more readily understood by referring to the following detailed description for a typical periscope for viewing through right angle with reference to the accompanying drawings and which are generally applicable to other periscopes to fulfill particular application illustrated hereinafter.<br><br>
In  the drawings Figure 1A illustrates a partial	cross<br>
sectional  elevation of the periscope for viewing  through	right<br>
angle  provided  in accordance with the present  invention	taken<br>
along the A—AA line of Figure 1B.<br>
Figure 1B shows side elevation of the new periscope for viewing through right angle provided in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 1C illustrates a bottom view of the periscope for viewing through right angle provided in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerical refers to like elements, Figure-1A shows a model of the new periscope for viewing through right angle 108 within a device for reflecting object or event generally by extended angle but specifically by right angle with a perception of a true image. The new periscope comprises an enclosure 101 with a coupling 102 for attachment or to be an integral part of any mask, binocular, spectacle or any external eye wear. The periscope further comprises a plurality of object reflectors 106 disposed in front of plurality of window openings 103 for accepting the light rays from the object or event under observation. The device further comprises     plurality of eye reflectors 105 disposed in  front  of<br><br>
another plurality of window openings 104 for receiving the rays of light from the object or event under observation for viewing by the user and the said window openings 103, 104 generally placed at a right angle to provide right angled path 108 for the reflected light and further the angle 109, 110, means between the reflectors means reflectors 109 and eye reflectors 110, are designed so as to reflect the incoming light ray from the object, means by the combined actions of the said reflector 105, 106 thereby bending them generally through right angle and further the light rays coming from the objects first reflect over the object reflector 106 means thereby bending them in the direction towards the eye reflector 105 means for further reflecting the light rays means towards the eyes reflector 105 means for further reflecting the light rays means towards the eyes of the user 111. The light rays coming from the object or event thus reflects twice thereby composing or creating a true perception of object image and thereby when the periscope is viewed through the eye reflector window opening 104, the user can see events perpendicular to the line of sight of the eye 111. In another embodiment of the invention the eye reflector may further consist of an adjustable arrangement 107 means for changing the reflection or bending angle means other than right angle, of the object or event.<br><br>
This has heretofore not been achievable with known periscopes and so the periscope for viewing through right angle under disclosure provided in accordance with the present invention solves a long-felt need in the art for periscope having light weight and simple construction. Further the new periscope eliminates the need for bending neck and/or eye sockets to view objects or event at right angle to the line of sight thereby rendering them very useful for patients who have to lie in supine position or the soldiers in the field, who have to lie in supine position for security reasons. It is also useful for bay-watches lying in maintaining vigil for events occuring in horizontal directions, or star gazers in standing or erect posture desire to see things directly above and for studying written or printed materials in spine position.<br>
The preferred embodiments as.shown in Figure 1A, Figure IB, and Figure 1C refer to a typical periscope for viewing through right angle under disclosure provided in accordance with the present invention, but it will be readily recognized by those with skill in the art of optics that a periscope based on the principles described herein employing plurality of object reflector and plurality of eye reflector placed at an angle to reflect the light through right angle without distorting the image of the object or event having different enclosures, can be built and designed on commerical scale.<br><br>
There have thus been described certain preferred embodiments of periscope for viewing through right angle under disclosure provided in accordance with the present invention, While preferred embodiments have been described and disclosed, it will be recognized by those with skill in the optics and related art that modifications are within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
