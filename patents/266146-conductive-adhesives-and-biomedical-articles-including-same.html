				<td>CONDUCTIVE ADHESIVES AND BIOMEDICAL ARTICLES INCLUDING SAME<br>
The present invention relates to conductive adhesive compositions and to biomedical articles that incorporate the conductive adhesive compositions as a component thereof.<br>
Background<br>
Therapeutic and diagnostic medical procedures utilize equipment capable of processing electrical signals or electrical currents that are received from the body of a patient or are delivered to the patient's body. In these procedures, the interface between the patient's skin and the applicable equipment typically includes a biomedical electrode constructed to include a conductor connected electrically to the medical equipment and a conductive medium that is adapted for contact with the patient's skin (e.g., with an adhesive).<br>
By way of example, biomedical electrodes are employed in therapeutic procedures and equipment such as in transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) devices that are used for pain management; neuromuscular stimulation (NMS) techniques for the treatment of certain conditions such as scoliosis; defibrillation electrodes for dispensing electrical energy to a patient's chest cavity to defibrillate the heart; and dispersive electrodes that receive electrical energy that has been applied to an incision made during electrosurgery. Biomedical electrodes are also employed in diagnostic procedures and equipment that include electrocardiography for monitoring heart activity and diagnosing heart abnormalities,<br>
Non-polarizable electrodes, and in particular electrodes made with silver and/or silver chloride are highly stable and have been widely used in diagnostic applications. In low-cost versions, these electrodes are often coated in thin sections of conductive ink on an insulating backing. Conductive inks formulated for these applications typically include<br><br>
silver/silver chloride particles and a polymeric binder. A conducting adhesive (e.g., a hydrogel or hydrocoUoid) is laminated to the silver - coated backing, and the assembly is die cut to the required electrode shape. The conductive adhesive serves the dual purpose of providing adhesion of the electrode to the skin as well as permitting electrical transduction of the electrical activity of the heart. The adhesive layer of the electrodes are protected with a release liner prior to the application of the electrode to the skin.<br>
The monolithic adhesive construction of typical non-polarizable electrodes has been problematic because of an exposed edge of adhesive along the perimeter of the electrode. The ionically conductive phase of the adhesive consists of an alkali or alkaline earth metal chloride (typically potassium or sodium chloride) dissolved in water with an optional humectant added to slow down evaporative loss. However, under low humidity conditions (which can be as low as 20% R.H in hospitals), rapid evaporative loss of water occurs along with an accompanying degradation of the electrical properties of the electrode. The electrical properties are related to the conductance of dissolved salt in the water/hxunectant mixture of the adhesive. As water evaporates, the humectant concentration increases. Because alkali and alkaline earth halides are poorly soluble in commonly used humectants, the ionic concentration of the adhesive is compromised and the electrical properties degrade.<br>
There is a need for improved conductive adhesives and for articles comprising such adhesives including biomedical articles such as biomedical electrodes, for example.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention provides conductive adhesives that can be used as electrically conductive components in an article such as a biomedical article including a biomedical electrode, for example. The conductive adhesives of the invention are resistant to the loss of electrical properties following a loss of moisture (e.g., water) from the adhesive, hi embodiments of the invention, the conductive adhesive is a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) comprising an organic chloride electrolyte and compatible humectant. Li some embodiments, the conductive adhesive is a bicontinuous, conductive, PSA having an aqueous phase and an oil phase with an organic chloride electrolyte compatible humectant and surfactant in the aqueous phase, ha some embodiments, the conductive adhesive is in the form of a hydrogel. In other embodiments, the PSA is a component in an article such as a biomedical electrode, for example.<br>
The adhesive of the invention can be prepared in any of a variety of processes. In some embodiments, the adhesive is prepared by way of a microemulsion that is of a viscosity suitable for coating onto a backing. The polymerized microemulsion PSA according to the present invention can be derived from polymerization of a free-radically polymerizable hydrophilic and/or amphiphilic monomers or oligomers in an aqueous phase with concurrent polymerization of free-radically polymerizable hydrophobic and/or amphiphilic monomers or oligomers in an organic (oil) phase. The resulting PSA can have a bicontinuous structure which, in some embodiments, may comprise two solid, substantially nonporous bicontinuous phases.<br><br>
Bicontinuous Adhesive Compositions<br>
In embodiments of the invention, bicontinuous adhesive compositions are provided by the polymerization of suitable monomers and/or oligomers provided in the forai of polymerizable microemulsion compositions. Prior to polymerization, the microemulsions typically include an aqueous phase that comprises water, free radically (co)polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated polar hydrophilic or ampliiphilic monomer(s) or oligomer(s), initiator, organic chloride electrolyte, humectant, surfactant and optional additives. The organic or oil phase typically comprises (co)polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated hydrophobic or amphiphilic monomer(s) or oligomer(s). Components of the microemulsion may be added in any logical order. For example, components may be initially combined in two or more separate blends. The initial blends may subsequently be combined to form a microemulsion. Components of a suitable microemulsion are discussed below.<br>
Water<br>
Microemulsion compositions generally comprises from about 2 to about 50 percent by weight of water (e.g., deionized water). In some embodiments, the compositions comprise from about 5 to about 30 percent by weight and, in some embodiments, from about 6 to about 25 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the microemulsion. The water phase may include water-soluble and/or water-dispersible additives selected to provide certain properties within the final PSA. To determine the most appropriate weight percent of water to be included in the microemulsion, the water can be added incrementally until a clear microemulsion region is achieved.<br>
Ethylenically-Unsaturated Free-Radically (Co)Polvmerizable Polar Species<br>
At least one free-radically polymerizable etliylenically-unsaturated polar monomer or oligomer is included in the microemulsion. Suitable polar monomers or oligomers can<br><br>
be oil insoluble (hydrophilic) or can be partially water soluble and partially oil soluble (amphiphilic) so that they will dissolve in or become associated with an aqueous phase in the microemulsion. In some embodiments^ the use of polar oligomers in the aqueous phase promotes formation of a substantially nonporous bicontinuous structure for the polymerized microemulsion PSA.<br>
Monomers may generally be selected from the group consisting of polar monomers that are substantially insoluble in the oil phase and polar monomers other than oil-insoluble monomers (e.g., polar monomers which are both water soluble and oil soluble).<br>
Microemulsions typically will comprise from about 2 to about 90 percent by weight of hydropMlic or amphiphilic monomers or oligomers. In some embodiments, the microemulsion will comprise from about 5 to about 70 percent by weight and, in other embodiments, from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based upon the total weight of the microemulsion, depending upon the desired properties of the polymerized PSA,<br>
Ethvlenicallv-Unsaturated Free-Radically fCo)Polymerizable Polar Oligomers<br>
Useftil polar ethylenically-unsaturated free-radically (co)polymerizable oligomers which are substantially insoluble in the oil phase or which are both water soluble and oil soluble include but are not limited to polyethylene oxide acrylates, polyethylene oxide diacrylates, polyethylene glycol acrylates, polyethylene glycol diacrylates, polyurethane acrylates, polyurethane diacrylates, N-vinylpyrrolidone macromer, and mixtures of two or more of the foregoing. In some embodiments, polyethylene oxide acrylates and diacrylates are used. Oligomers can have a number average molecular weight of about 100 to about 100,000. In some embodiments the number average molecular weight can range from about 100 to about 60,000, or from about 100 to about 5000. Molecular weight ranges may be selected to provide a PSA with optimal physical properties (e.g., water absorption, porosity, strength).<br><br>
jEthylenicallv-Unsaturated Free-Radically rCo^Polvinerizable Substantially Oil-Insoluble Polar Monomers<br>
An optional polar monomer for inclusion in the aqueous phase of a microemulsion is a water-soluble JSree-radically (co)polymerizable ethylenically-unsaturated polar monomer that is substantially insoluble in the oil phase. As used herein, "substantially oil-insoluble" and "water-soluble" mean that the monomer has a solubility of less than about 0.5% by weight in the oil phase and exhibits a distribution ratio at a given temperature (preferably about 25°C to about 35°C) of concentration in the oil phase to concentration in the aqueous phase of less than about 0.005. Such monomer may be nonionic such as acrylamide, for example, or such a monomer may be ionic. Mixtures of nonionic and ionic monomers may also be used.<br>
Ionic monomers conforming to the foregoing criteria include but are not limited to sodium styrene sulfonate, potassium acrylate, sodium acrylate^ sodium methacrylate, ammonium acrylate, sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate, 454,9-trimethyI-4-a2onia-7-oxa-dec-9-ene-1 -sulfonate, N,N-dimethyl-N-(beta-methacryloxyethyI)ammonium propionate betaine, trimethylamine methacrylamide, 1,1-dimethyl-1-(23-dihydroxypropyl)amine methacrylamide, and other 2witterionic ethylenically-unsaturated monomers having the requisite solubility requirements, mixtures thereof, and the like. In some embodiments, oil-insoluble polar monomers include those selected from the group consisting of acrylamide, sodium styrenesulfonate, sodium acrylate, sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate, sodium methacrylate, and mixtures thereof, due to ease of formulation and desirable properties when polymerized.<br>
In some embodiments, it may be desirable to limit the amounts of anionic monomers in order to prevent the possible in situ formation of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chlorides, the presence of which could result in a loss of conductivity if moisture is lost from the adhesive.<br>
Other EthylenicaUy-Unsaturated Free-Radically (Co)Polymerizable Polar Monomers<br><br>
Polar monomers can exhibit some solubility in both water and oil, having a solubility of about 0.5% or greater in the oil phase and exhibiting a distribution ratio at a given temperature (preferably about 25°C to about 35^C) of concentration in the oil phase to a concentration in the aqueous phase of greater than or equal to about 0.005. Useful polar ethylenically-unsaturated free-radically (co)polymerizable monomers partitionable between the aqueous phase and the oil phase of the microemulsion include but are not limited to N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylcaprolactam, (meth)acrylic acid, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate5 itaconic acid^ styrene sulfonic acid, N-substituted acrylamides^ N,N-disubstituted acrylamides, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid, and mixtures thereof.

In some embodiments, polar partitionable monomers can impart desired properties to the biphasic polymer composite, such monomers including acrylic acid, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylcaprolactam, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Water-Soluble Initiators<br>
The microemulsion may optionally comprise a water-soluble free-radical polymerization initiator. In some embodiments, the initiator is selected from the group consisting of thermal initiators, photoinitiators, and mixtures of the foregoing. Water soluble initiators dissolve in the aqueous phase of the microemulsion.<br>
Water-Soluble Photoinitiators<br>
Water-soluble photoinitiators useful in the present invention include photoinitiators that generate free radicals on exposure to electromagnetic (usually ultraviolet) radiation which initiates the (co)polymerization of the hydrophilic monomer(s), the oleophilic<br><br>
mDnomer(s)5 the (co)polymerizable oligomers, and (^\poJyrnerizable surfactant as detailed below. Useful water-soluble photoinitiators include but are not limited to benzophenones substituted with an ionic moiety, a hydrophilic moiety or both; thioxanthones substituted with an ionic moiety, a hydrophilic moiety or both, and 4-substituted-(2-hydroxy-2-propyl)phenyl ketones, wherein the 4'-substituent is an ionic or hydrophilic moiety, Ionic or hydrophilic moieties include but are not limited to hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, and carboxylic acid salt groups. Useful water-soluble benzophenones include but are not limited to 4-trimethylaminomethyl benzophenone hydrochloride and benzophenone sodium 4-methanesulfonate. Useful water-soluble thioxanthones include but are not limited to 3-(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylaminopropoxy) thioxanthone hydrochloride, 3-(3-trimethylaminopropoxy)tliioxanthone hydrochloride, thioxanthone 3-(2-ethoxysulfonic acid)sodiura salt, and thioxantiione 3-(3-propoxysulfonic acid) sodium salt. Useful water-soluble phenyl ketones include but are not limited to (2-hydroxy-2-propyl)(4-diethylene glycol phenyl) ketone, (2-hydroxy-2-propyl)(phenyl-4-butanecarboxylate) ketone, 4-(2-hydroxethoxy)phenyl-(2-propyI) ketone, and their water-soluble salts. In some embodiments of the invention, the water-soluble photoinitiator is 4-trimethylaminomethylbenzophenone hydrochloride. In some embodiments, mixtures of the foregoing may be used.<br>
The aqueous phase of the microemulsion may comprise from about 0.05 to about 1 part by weight of a photoinitiator, and in some embodiments from about 0.1 to about 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of total (co)polymerizable species in the microemulsion.<br>
Water-Soluble Thermal Initiators<br>
Water-soluble thermal initiators useful in the invention include those that, on exposure to heat, generate free-radicals that initiate (co)pc&gt;lymerization of the hydrophilic monomer(s), the oleophilic monomer(s), the (co)polymerizable oligomer(s) and, when present, the (co)polymerizable surfactant(s), discussed herein. Suitable water-soluble thermal initiators include but are not limited to potassium persulfate, ammonium<br><br>
are not limited to those selected from the group consikiqg^of from about Ci to about Cig alkyl esters of acrylic acid, i.e., those esters derived from acrylic acid and from about C\ to about CI8J provided that such monomers are suitable for forming a hydrophobic polymer having pressure sensitive adhesive properties.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymerized microemulsion PSA can be determined using known techniques, and the Tg of a polymerized microemulsion PSA is determined, in part, by the selection of the hydrophobic monomers used in forming a hydrophobic polymer having pressure sensitive adhesive properties. A Tg of less than about 10°C will frequently be associated with a hydrophobic polymer having pressure sensitive adhesive properties, and a Tg of less than about 0°C will more frequently be associated with a hydrophobic polymer having pressure sensitive adhesive properties. Even more frequently, a Tg of less than about -lO^C will be associated with a hydrophobic polymer having pressure sensitive adhesive properties, hi some embodiments, alkyl acrylates, including isooctyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, and n-butyl acrylate, are preferred because of their availability for use and because of the Tg of the resulting hydrophobic polymer formed from such hydrophobic monomers.<br>
The organic phase may frirther optionally comprise free-radically polymerizable ethylenically-unsaturated comonomers which are copolymerizable with the alkyl acrylate monomers described above in order to modify the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resulting polymerized microemulsion PSA, from that Tg contributed by the hydrophobic monomer(s). Suitable comonomers include styrene, acrylonitrile, and vinyl esters (such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl neopentanoate, etc.) and combinations thereof. The selection of the comonomer(s) may be dependent on the properties desired of the final solid bicontinuous polymer.<br>
The polymerized microemulsion PSAs of the invention generally comprise from about 5 to about 80 percent by weight of hydrophobic monomers, typically from about 10 to about 70 percent by weight, and in some embodiments from about 12 to about 60 percent by weight based on the total weight of the microemulsion, in order to impart<br><br>
sufficient strength, cohesiveness, and pressure sensitive adhesive properties to the resulting polymerized microemulsion PSA. The actual concentrations of each constituent of the microemulsion can be altered by the skilled practitioner depending on the desired pressure sensitive adhesive properties of the copolymer.<br>
Free-Radically (Co)Polvmerizable Polar Monomer<br>
The organic phase of a microemulsion will typically contain a portion of the free-radically polymerizable amphiphihc polar monomers described above because of the partitioning of such organic materials between the aqueous phase and the organic phase of a microemulsion, as described previously. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each monomer will exhibit its own distribution ratio, the enumeration of which is not necessary for the understanding and practicing of the present invention.<br>
Hydrophobic Initiators<br>
The oil phase of the microemulsion may optionally further comprise an hydrophobic free-radical polymerization initiator. In some embodiments, the initiator is selected from the group consisting of thermal initiators, photoinitiators, and mixtures of the foregoing.<br>
Hydrophobic Photoinitiators<br>
Useful hydrophobic photoinitiators generally include those that generate free radicals on exposure to electromagnetic (usually ultraviolet) radiation which initiate the (co)polymerization of the hydrophilic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s), the oleophilic monomer(s), and (co)polymerizable surfactant. Useful photoinitiators include, but are not limited to: (1) mixtures of Michler's ketone and benzil or benzophenone, preferably in a weight ratio of about 1:4; (2) coumai'in-based photoinitiator systems as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,289,844, incorporated by reference herein; and (3) systems based on dimethoxyphenylacetophenone and/or diethoxyacetophenone.<br><br>
Hydrophobic photoinitiators are initially included in the microemulsions as part of the organic phase. On irradiation, the free-radicals thus generated effect (co)polyinerization of monomers in both the aqueous and the organic phases, as well as copolymerization of any (co)polymerizable surfactant. In some embodiments, the organic phase of a microemulsion will, comprise from about 0.01 to about 5 parts by weight of an oil soluble photoinitiator, based on 100 parts by weight of total (co)polymeri2able species in the microemulsion.<br>

optional Reactive Lipophilic Additives<br>
Microemulsions may further comprise one or more additional free-radically reactive constituents, including, but not limited to hydrophobic crosslinking agents, chain transfer agents, and mixtures thereof. Such additional components will be present in the oil phase of the microemulsion. Examples of useful crosslinking agents include but are not limited to those selected from the group consisting of divinylbenzene; about C4 to about Cg alkyl diacrylates such as 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, l.,6-hexanediol diacrylate, 1,8-octanediol diacrylate; and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the crosslinking agent is 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate. Crosslinking agent, if added, changes the physical properties, such as cohesive strength, of the final polymer.<br>
The oil phase may optionally further comprise about 0 to about 10 or more, parts by weight crosslinker; typically about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total oil phase. The amount of crosslinker used will determine the physical properties of the polymer, such as its solubility (or insolubility) in certain solvents, its modulus and its internal strength.<br>
The microemulsion may further comprise a chain transfer agent soluble in the oil phase. Examples of useful chain transfer agents include carbon tetrabromide, alcohols, mercaptans, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the chain transfer agent is isooctylthioglycolate.

surfactants include ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers. TETRONIC surfactants include ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers.<br>
Other satisfactory nonreactive nonionic surfactants include but are not limited to sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters and polyoxyethylene stearates having fILBs from about 6 to about 19, typically from about 9 to about 18, and in some embodiments from about 10 to about 16.

Suitable conraiercially available fluorochemical based polyester liners are available fi-om 3M Company of St. Paul, Minnesota under the trade designations SCOTCHPAK 1020 SCOTCHPAK 1022, SCOTCHPAK 9741.<br><br>
Regarding the sections 44 and 45 of tlie insulator construction 41, a flexible, strong and relatively thin material is typically used to provide the electrode in a construction that is comfortable to the user. In some embodiments, the material can be a foamed polymer such as, for example, polyethylene foam. Other suitable materials include non-v^oven pads (e.g., polyester non-woven pads), paper, and transparent films.

Such materials will also have a suitable tensile strength and moisture vapor transmission rate. Suitable moisture vapor transmission rates include those in the range from about 500 to about 3000 grams water/m /24 hours, and in some embodiments fi:om about 500 to about 1500 grams water/m / 24 hours, when tested according to ASTM E96-80 at 21°C and 50% relative humidity. In some embodiments, the material has a stretch recovery of at least about 85%, in all directions, after stretch of 50%.<br>
Wliile the insulator construction described herein can be made to have any of a variety of dimensions and may be made in virtually any size or shape, it will be<br><br>
appreciated that conventional biomedical electrodes are relatively small devices. In embodiments of the electrodes described herein, the dimensions of the insulator construction typically will range from about 3.5 to about 4.5 cm in a first dimension (e.g., width) and from about 5.5cm to about 10 cm in a second dimension (e.g., length). Depending on the materials used, a thickness of about 200 to 600 micrometers typically provides adequate strength and a low relief or profile, suitable for most applications.    . ■<br>
Regarding the adhesive 69, any of the acrylate ester adhesives in double stick tape fonn may be used. In some embodiments, the adhesive 69 can be the same adhesive as described herein for the skin adhesive but having an inherent viscosity fi"om about 1.3 to about 1.45 dl/g. For the field 70 of conductive adhesive, conductive adhesives such as those described above as useful for field 14 of conductive medium are preferred.<br>
It will be appreciated that the dimensions of the various layers, and their conformation during association, are not to scale in any of the various Figures. In fact features may be shown in the Figures in a somewhat exaggerated maimer in order to better illustrate the features of the depicted construction(s) and thereby facilitate a better understanding of the constmction. In general, an overall substantially flat appearance .with only a very minor "s" type bend in the conductive member 42 is acconomodated by the arrangement, despite the multilayered construction of member 42.<br>

EXAMPLES<br><br>
Embodiments of the invention are further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples, in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise stated.<br>
Test Methods<br>
For testing purposes electrode pairs were adhered to each other, their layers of bicontinuous adhesive being placed in contact face-to-face. This arrangement is specified in a standard published by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instnmientation (AAMI) for determining the proper performance for a biomedical electrode used for ECG Disposable Electrodes, specifically the "American National Standard for Pregelled ECG Disposable Electrodes" Association for the Advancement of Medical histrumentation (1984), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference, for testing methods and conditions for minimum standards. The properties of D.C. Offset (less than 100 mV); A.C. Impedance (less than 2 kOhms); Defibrillation Overload Recovery (less than 100 mV, 5 seconds after 4 capacitor discharges) and a rate of change of Residual Polarization Potential (no greater than 1 mV/sec.) were measured for Test Examples and Comparative Examples according to these standard test methods.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example employs an organic chloride electrolyte in a conductive adhesive used in tab style electrodes. A microemulsion was prepared for use as a conductive adhesive according to the invention. The microemulsion was prepared in the manner generally disclosed in coassigned U.S. Patent 6,709,716 issued March 23, 2004 to Uy et al. More specifically, a first mixture was fomied by mixing quantities of two monomers, namely 14 grams of acryhc acid as a hydrophilic monomer with 14 grams of isooctyl acrylate as a hydrophobic monomer that was commercially obtained fi^om e.g., Atofina Chemicals, Inc. of Pliiladelphia, PA. To this was added 7 grams of a surfactant, commercially available under the trade designation BRIJ 98 from Uniqema of New Castle, DE; and 3 grams of a surfactant, commercially available under the trade designation HETOXOL OL35 from Global Seven of Franldin, NJ. Then, 0.3 grams of photoinitiator.<br><br>
commercially available under the trade designation IRGACURE 2959, from Ciba Gigy Corp., was added to complete a first mixture.<br>
A second mixture was then prepared by mixing 22 grams water; 8 grams choline chloride from Spectrum Chemicals of Brunswick, NJ; 10 grams glycerol; 25 grams of butylene glycol, both from Sigma Chemicals of Milwaukee, WI.<br>
The first and second mixtures were combined together to form a microemulsion. To the microemulsion, 0.2 grams a hydrophobically modified polyeicrylate prepared from acrylic acid monomer, commercially available under the trade designation of PEMULEN TR-2, obtained from Noveon Inc. of Cleveland, OH, was added as a viscosity modifier and 0.2 grams of polyethylene glycol (400) diacrylate obtained from Sartomer Company, Inc of Exton, PA was added as a cross-linking agent. After the addition, the microemulsion remained clear and stable and the viscosity increased to approximately 200 cp, readily processable using conventional techniques.<br>
The thickened microemulsion was then coated using a knife coater onto a release liner as substrate. The knife was set so that a 0.64 mm (25 mil) thick coating was obtained. Polymerization was induced in the coated microemulsion by exposure to ultraviolet radiation using a 350 Blacklight, commercially available from Sylvania of Danvers, MA. A total dose of 1800 mJ/cm^ was applied over approximately 7 minutes, forming a conductive, bicontinuous adhesive. This conductive adhesive had an excellent adhesion to human skin.<br>
Several 1.0 square centimeter swatches of this adhesive were bonded to a conductive silver/silver chloride ink backing on one side and to a release liner on the other side. The backing was larger than the adhesive swatch (2 cm x 1 cm) leaving 1 square cm as a tab for electrical contact. The backing was made by coating a silver/silver chloride conductive ink solution commercially available imder the trade designation "R300", from Ercon Inc. of Waltham, MA, onto a polymeric backing made from 0.1 nam thick polyester film commercially available under the trade designation MELINEX 505 from ICI Films of<br><br>
I<br>
Hopewell, VA, using a wire-coating procedure. The ink had a solids content of 58%, of which the elemental silver comprised 70%. The carrier solvent for the ink was methyl propyl ketone (MPK). The coated film was then dried at room temperature for 5 minutes followed by drying at 93 °C (200°F) for 5 minutes.<br>
Comparative Example CI<br>
A microemulsion adhesive was prepared according to the procedure outlined in Example 1 above, with the following changes: four grams of potassium chloride were used in place of choline chloride. 26 grams of water was used, and the surfactant mixture was replaced with 10 grams of BRIJ 97 obtained from Uniqema of New Castle, DE.<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example CI<br>
Six tab style electrodes were fabricated from the adhesives described in each Example 1 and Comparative Example CI. Three each of the electrode pairs were placed in a 15% R.H, chamber for 18 hours with the adhesive surface exposed while another 3 pairs were not exposed to the 15% R.H. Electrode pairs were prepared from both the unexposed and 15% R.H. exposed samples. These pairs were adhered to each other, their layers of bicontinuous adhesive being placed in contact face-to-face according to the AAMI standard. Each result in Table 1 shows the average test results for 3 pairs of Example 1 and Comparative Example CI, before and after exposure to the 15% R.H.<br><br><br><br>
After equilibrating the adhesive to 15% R.H., the Example 1 electrodes were still electrically viable. The Comparative Example CIB impedance increased by a factor of 50 . as opposed to Example IB (choline chloride) electrode, v^here the impedance after dry out increased by only a factor of 10. In addition, the CIB electrodes, with potassium chloride,<br>
failed the SDR slope test.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example employs organic chloride electrolytes in conductive adhesives used in snap type electrodes which are used for monitoring and longer-term wear. The conductive element has a much smaller footprint than the tab-style electrodes. The electrode construction is described in detail in U.S. Patent 6,709,716 issued March 23, 2004 to Uy et al. Briefly, the biomedical electrode has a nonconductive backing having an opening covered by a snap through which a stud or eyelet protrudes. The snap is secured to the eyelet to provide a point of electrical connection to electrical instrumentation. Covering the eyelet and backing is a field of the polymerized microemulsion PSA of the present invention. A release liner protects the PSA field prior to use. The backing can be made of the same or similar materials as the insulator construction. The eyelet can be a plastic, metallic plated eyelet (such as an ABS plastic eyelet silver- plated and chlorided and commercially available from Micron Products of Fitchburg, MA). The snap can be a metallic snap (such as stainless steel eyelet No. 304 commercially available from Eyelets for Industry of Thomason, CN). In this type of electrode the polymerized microemulsion PSA of the present invention can serve both as the biocompatible skin adhesive and as the ionically conductive medium in the electrode.<br>
The same adhesive as is described in Example 1 was used to prepare snap-type electrodes. As in Example 1, half of the electrodes were removed from the liner and placed in a chamber at 15% R.H. for 18 hours with the adhesive surface exposed for rapid<br><br>
equilibration with the chamber. The resuhs of electrical testings according to the AAMI procedure on both sets of electrodes, are shown in Table 2. Each test result represents an average of 3 pairs of electrodes.<br>
Comparative Example C2<br>
Compm*ative Example C2 used the same snap-type electrode construction as in Example 2, except that choline chloride electrolyte was replaced with potassium chloride as in Compai'ative Example CI. The AAMI electrical testing data is shovra in Table 2. Each test result represents an average of 3 pairs of electrodes.<br><br>
The Example 2B electrodes exhibited a six-fold increase in impedance. None of the electrical characteristics of the electrodes were compromised. The electrodes of Comparative Example C2 failed the impedance test when exposed to a low humidity chamber.<br>
Example 3<br><br>
Example 3 employed organic electrolytes in conductive adhesives for snap type electrodes converted on release liner where the adhesive perimeter (sandwiched between the electrode backing and the release liner) was exposed to low humidity. Snap-type electrode backings were fabricated as in Example 2 and were converted on release liner using the adhesive synthesized in Example 1. Initial back-to-back electrical testing was conducted according to the AAMI procedure using 12 electrode pairs. Example 3 electrodes on release liner were then aged at 21°C (70°F) in two independent chambers maintained at 0% R.H. and 15% R.H. for 30 days. Samples were pulled from both chambers after 10, 20, and 30 days of aging. Back-to-back electrical testing on both sets of electrodes was conducted according to the AAMI procedure on 12 pairs of electrodes at each of these time points. The average results for both sets of Example 3 electrodes are shown below in Table 3A.<br>
Comparative Example C3<br>
A microemulsion was prepared as follows. A first mixture was formed by mixing two hydrophihc monomers, 14 grams of aciylic acid with 14 gram of polyoxyethylene acrylate, commercially available as AM 90G ester from Shin-Nakamura Chemical Co. Ltd. of Wakayama Japan. To this was added 14 grams of isooctyl acrylate in the role of a hydrophobic monomer. To this second mixture was added 18 grams of a surfactant BRIJ 97, available from ICI to form a third mixture. Then 0.5 grams of IRGACURE 2959 initiator, was added to form a fourth mixture. An aqueous mixture was then prepared containing 23 grams water, 1.2 grams KCl and 10 grams of propylene glycol. The aqueous mixture and the fourth mixture were combined together to form a microemulsion. To the microemulsion was added a 17% aqueous polyacrylic acid solution having a molecular weight approximately 550,000^ prepared from monomer using standard synthetic techniques. Specifically, polymerization was initiated by the heat activated initiator potassium persulfate, and the reaction was run under a nitrogen atmosphere at 76°C.<br>
When the solution was added to the microemulsion, the microemulsion remained clear and stable and the viscosity increased to approximately 200 cps, readily processable using conventional techniques. The thickened microemulsion was then coated using a<br><br>
knife coater onto a release liner as substrate. The knife was set so that a 25 mil (0.64 mm) thick coating was obtained. Polynierization was induced in the coated microemulsion by exposure to ultraviolet radiation using a 350 Blacklight, commercially available from Sylvania of Danvers, MA. A total dose of 1800 mJ/cm^ was applied over approximately 7 minutes, forming a conductive, bicontinuous adhesive. This conductive adhesive had an excellent adhesion to human skin.<br>
Snap-type electrode backings were fabricated according to Example 2 and converted on release liner using this adhesive. Initial back-to-back electrical testing was conducted according to the AAMI procedure using 12 electrode pairs. Electrodes on release liner were then aged at 21 °C (70°F) in two independent chambers maintained at 0% R.H. and 15% R,H. for 30 days. Samples were pulled from both chambers after 10, 20, and 30 days of aging. Back-to-back electrical testing on both sets of electrodes was conducted according to the AAMI procedure on 12 pairs of electrodes at each of these time points. The average results for both sets of Comparative Example C3 electrodes are shown in Table 3B.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Example 4 shows the clinical performance of electrodes fabricated from adhesive containing choline chloride and aged for 30 days on liner at 0% and 15% R.H. The clinical performance was measured by the time required to obtain a stable ECG trace after<br>
electrode application on the skin.<br>
Materials: Snap-type electrodes were fabricated from the backing, adhesive, and liner materials described in Example 3. One third of the electrodes were sealed in water and air-impermeable pouches, these electrodes served as controls. Another thkd was aged on liner at 21'C (70°F) and 0% R.H. for thirty days and the remaining third was aged on liner at 21^C (70°F) and 15% R.H. for thirty days.<br>
The initial impedance was first measured using each Example 4 electrode applied to a subject's arm. One sample of each Example 4 electrode (4A, control; 4B, stored @ 15%R.H. and 4C, stored @ 0% R.H.) was applied to each of 4 quadrants on each of 12 subjects' torso. The time to acceptable EKG trace was recorded. Note, that an acceptable trace was required in both leads 1 and 2. The average results (n=48) of the impedance and time to acceptable trace for each Example 4 electrode, under each condition, axe shown in Table 4.<br>
TABLE 4<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
This Example employed a different organic "onium" electrolyte in conductive adhesives used in snap type electrodes. The electrode construction is identical to the one described in Example 2 with the exception of the adhesive. The adhesive was an acrylate based single phase PSA. The adhesive precursor comprises 15 grams of acrylic acid, 20 grams of 2'-hydroxyethyl methacrylate obtained from San Esters Corporation of New York, NY; 11 grams of tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich of St. Louis, MO; 25 grams 1,3 butylene glycol, 10 grams glycerol, 19 grams water, 0.55 grams IRGACURE 2959 and O.lSgrams polyethylene glycol(400) diacrylate. The precursor was coated using a knife coater onto a release liner as substrate. The knife was set so that a 25 mil (0.64 mm) thick coating was obtained. Polymerization was induced in the coated microemulsion by exposure to ultraviolet radiation using a 350 Blacklight, commercially available from Sylvania of Danvers, MA. A total dose of 1800 mJ/cm^ was applied over approximately 7 minutes, forming a conductive, bicontinuous adhesive. This conductive adhesive had an excellent adhesion to human skin.<br>
Snap-type electrode backings were fabricated as in Example 2 and converted on release liner using this adhesive.<br>
Comparative Examples C5<br>
Comparative Example C5 used the same electrode construction as in Example 4, except replacing the phosphoniimi chloride adhesive with a potassium chloride adhesive of the same composition with the following exceptions: 11 grams of the phosphonium<br><br>
chloride was replaced with 4.2 grams potassium chloride and 19 grams water was increased to 25.8 grams.<br>
Example 5 and Comparative Example C5<br>
Electrical testing according to the AAMI procedure was conducted on both sets of electrodes (3 each) for Example 5 and for Comparative Example C5. As in the previous examples, half the electrodes were removed from the liner and placed in a 15% R.H. chamber for 18 hours with the adhesive surface exposed for rapid equilibration with the chamber, while half were not exposed to the 15% R.H. condition. The results are shown in Table 5, below.<br><br>
Example 5B electrodes with phosphonium chloride withstood drying out with a six-fold increase in impedance. None of the electrical characteristics of the electrodes were compromised. Comparative Example CSB, the potassium chloride based electrodes, showed a 20-fold increase in impedance and failed the impedance test when exposed to a<br>
low humidity chamber.<br>
