This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition (tablet) containing biphosphonate as an active substance and process to prepare the composition.<br>
The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition for oral application consisting of a high dose of bisphosphonates or physiologically safe salts thereof as active substance and to a process for the preparation of such compositions.<br>
Aminoalkyl-1,1 -diphosphonic acid derivatives (hereinafter called by the general term 5 bisposphonates) are important pharmaceutical agents in the treatment of bone diseases and some disturbances of calcium metabolism such as hypercalcaemia, osteoporosis, turnour osteolysis, Paget's disease, etc.<br>
Bisposphonates as pharmaceutical agents are described for example in EP-A-170,228, EP A-197,478, EP-A-22,751; EP-A 252,504, EP-A- 252,505, EP-A-258,618, EP-A-350,002, EP-A-273,190, WO-A-90/00798 each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms of currently marketed bisphosphonates are oral formulations (tablets or capsules) or solutions for intravenous injection or infusion. They are systemically well tolerated when administered at therapeutic doses. However, bisphsphonates as a class are irritant to skin and mucous membranes and when given orally on a continuous basis may result in digestive tract side effects, e.g. esophageal adverse events or gastrointestinal disturbances. In consequence, and due to their low oral bioavailability, the oral route of administration has, to date, to follow inconvenient recommendations of use for the patient.<br>
As described, bisphosphonates are accepted as providing strong efficacy in the management of osteoporosis. However, given the administration restrictions related to low oral bioavailability and potential for gastro-intestinal side effects, there is a clear opportunity for regimens which offer improved convenience and flexibility, leading to a higher level of compliance and superior patient management / satisfaction.<br><br>
Furthermore it has been found in the Ibandronate clinical development program, that Ibandronate showed fracture reduction efficacy with a drug-free interval beyond daily administration. It was quite unexpected that fracture reduction benefit could be derived from a weekly or monthly administration of an oral bisphosphonate with a single or multiple tablet administration scheme.<br>
For this purpose a new composition comprising a high dose, namely up to 250 mg, preferably comprising 150 mg or 100 mg of a bisphosphonate derivative, especially of ibandronate or physiological safe salts thereof had to be prepared, which on the one hand has an increased ratio of active substances vs excipients and on the other hand which fulfills the requirements of stability.<br>
It has been found that the stability of such high dose formulations is substantially increased by adding the disintegrant already in the granulation step together with the active substance and with a part of the filler material. Such compositions are easily dissolvable and have an increased stability on storage both with regard to temperature and humidity.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention comprises up to 250 mg, preferably up to 200 mg, especially comprising 150 mg or 100 mg of a bisphosphonate, especially of ibandronate or a physiological safe salt thereof as an active substance.<br>
The following bisphosphonates are active substances which can be used in the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention in the form of free acids or<br>
physiological safe salts or hydrates, particularly sodium salts:<br>
(4-amino-l-hydroxybutylidene)bis-phosphonate (alendronate),<br>
(dichloromethylene)bis-phosphonate(clodronate),<br>
[ l-hydroxy-3-( l-pyrrolidinyl)-propylidene]bis-phosphonate (EB-1053),<br>
(l-hydroxyethylidene)bis-phosphonate (etidronate),<br>
[l-hydroxy-3-(methyl pentyl amino)propylidene]bis-phosphonate (ibandronate),<br>
[Cycloheptylamino)-methylene]bis-phosphonate(incadronate),<br>
(6-amino-l -hydroxyhexylidene)bis-phosphonate (neridronate),<br>
[3-(dimethylamino)-l-hydroxypropylidene]bis-phosphonate(olpadronate),<br>
(3-amino-l-hydroxypropylidene)bis-phosphonate (pamidronate),<br>
[l-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylene]bis-phosphonate(risedronate),<br>
[[(4-chlorophenyl)thiol]-methylene]bis-phosphonate(tiludronate),<br>
[l-hydroxy-2-imidazo-(l,2-a)pyridin-3-yl ethylidene]bis-phosphona.te (YH 529),<br>
[l-hydroxy-2-(lH-imidazol-l-yl)ethylidene]bis-phosphonate (zoledronate); especially [1-<br>
hydroxy-3-(methyl pentyl amino)propylidene]bis-phosphonate (ibandronate)<br><br>

Preferred are compositions comprising the equivalent of 150 mg bisphosphonates or physiological safe salts thereof and compositions comprising the equivalent of 100 mg bisphosphonates or physiological safe salts as active substances, respectively. Ibandxonate or a physiological safe salt thereof is a particularly preferred active substance, particularly in the form of Na-Ibandronate monohydrate.<br>

Preferably the active substance is ibandronate or a physiological safe salt thereof; preferably the binder is polyvinylpyrrolidone; preferred fillers are lactose in hydrate or anhydrate form, or cellulose in microcrystalline or fibrous form; and a preferred disintegrant is cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Preferred are compositions wherein the disintegrant is added<br><br>
already in the granulate together with the active substance and with a part of the filler material.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the oral application comprising a high dose of bisphosphonates, especially of ibandronate or a physiological safe salt thereof. According to the invention the pharmaceutical composition is prepared<br>
-	by wet granulation of the bisphosphonate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the presence of adjuvants such as the binder and a part of fillers mentioned above, characterized in that the disintergrant is added into the granulation mixture;<br>
-	fluidising the granulation mixture in a manner known per se;<br>

-	adding the remaining adjuvants such as the fillers, lubricant and flow regulators mentioned above and blending the mixture before processing it by techniques known per se to form pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
In a preferred form of the invention the active substance, a part of the filler, and the disintegrant in dry powder form are granulated by spraying an aqueous binder solution into the powder mixture. The process is preferably carried out at a temperature of 60 to 80 °C, preferably at about 70°C.<br>
The spray granulated material is then dried preferably at a temperature of 60 to 80 °C, preferably at about 70°C and subsequently screened through a fine sieve; the dried granulate is mixed with the remaining amount of the filler, the lubricant, and the flow regulator which were previously passed through a fine sieve. The final blend is then pressed into tablet kernels which are coated with a coating suspension using purified water and a film-coating mixture.<br>
The process according to the invention is carried out as follows:<br>
a)	dissolving the binder, preferably Povidone K25® in purified water;<br>
b)	charging a drier, preferably a fluid-bed drier with the bisphosphonate, preferably with the mono-sodium salt (IH2O) of Ibandronic acid, a part of the filler preferably with lactose monohydrate and up to 60 % by weight of the total amount of microcrystalline cellulose, and the disintegrant;<br>

d)	drying the spray granulated material of step c) at a temperature of 60 to 80 °C, preferably at about 70°C (setpoint of inlet-air temperature) and subsequently screening the dried intermediate through a fine sieve;<br>
e)	mixing the granulate of step e) with the remaining amount of the filler e.g. micro-crystalline cellulose, the lubricant, preferably stearic acid and the flow regulator, for example anhydrous colloidal silica which were previously passed through a fine sieve (e.g. lmm);<br>
f)	compressing the final blend off) into tablet kernels; and coating the tablet with a coating suspension using purified water and a film-coating mixture comprising for example hypromellose, titanium dioxide and talc (the mixture is purchased from the<br>
market e.g. Opadry® 00A28646) and Macrogol 6000®.<br>
