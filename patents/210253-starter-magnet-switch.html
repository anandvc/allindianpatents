STARTER MAGNET SWITCH<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a starter magnet switch that permits/inhibits the supply of electric power to a starter motor.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view showing a conventional starter magnet switch, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 11-182390. In the figure, a switch case 2 is connected to one end portion of a cylindrical solenoid case 1. A pair of fixed contacts 3 and 4 are fixed at a given interval within the switch case 2. A pair of conductors 5 and 6 -are electrically connected to the fixed contacts 3 and 4/ respectively.<br>
A cylindrical bobbin 7 is accommodated within the solenoid case 1. A coil 8 is held on the outer peripheral portion of the bobbin 7. A fixed iron core 9 is fixed within the solenoid case 1. The fixed iron core 9 includes a flange portion 9a which is in contact with an end surface of the bobbin 7 at the switch case 2 side and a cylindrical portion 9b which is inserted into the bobbin 7.<br>
A movable iron core 10 that slidably reciprocates is inserted into the bobbin 7. One end portion of the movable iron core 10 is brought in or out of contact with the end surface of the cylindrical<br><br>
portion 9b. Also, the other end portion of the movable iron core<br>
10	projects externally from the solenoid case 1. An opening spring<br>
11	that urges the movable iron core 10 in a direction where the movable iron core 10 is dissociated from the fixed iron core 9 is disposed between the other end portion of the movable iron core 10 and the solenoid case.<br>
One end portion of the movable iron core 10 is fixed with a rod 12 that extends axially of the movable iron core 10 and reciprocates together with the movable iron core 10. The rod 12 includes a large-diameter portion 12a fixed onto the movable iron core 10 and a small-diameter portion 12b adjacent to the large-diameter portion 12a.<br>
Fig. 12 is a front view showing a leading portion of the rod<br>
12	shown in Fig. 11, and Fig. 13 is a cross-sectional view taken<br>
along a line XIII-XIII of Fig. 12. The small-diameter portion 12b<br>
of the rod 12 is equipped with a holding member 13 that can<br>
reciprocate in an axial direction of the small-diameter portion<br>
12b. The holding member 13 includes a flange portion 13a and a<br>
cylindrical portion 13b. A ring-shaped holding plate 14 is abutted<br>
against an end surface of the cylindrical portion 13b.<br>
A plate-shaped movable contact 15, which is brought in or out of contact with the pair of fixed contacts 3 and 4, is supported by the rod 12 . The movable contact 15 is disposed between the flange portion 13a and the holding plate 14 . A contact spring 16 that urges<br><br>
the movable contact 15 toward the fixed contacts 3 and 4 is disposed between the large-diameter portion 12a of the rod 12 and the holding member 13.<br>
An annular mounting groove 12c is defined in the outer periphery of the leading portion of the small-diameter portion 12b. The mounting groove 12c is equipped with a metallic C-shaped stopper (stopper ring) 17 that regulates the movement of the movable contact 15 toward the axial direction of the rod 12. The stopper 17 is hardened by quenching or the like. A washer 18 is inserted into the small-diameter portion 12b between the stopper 17 and the holding plate 14.<br>
A cover 19 is made of a metal softer than that of the stopper<br>
17 and inserted into the small diameter portion 12b between the<br>
washer 18 and the stopper 17. The cover 19 includes a ring portion<br>
19a that intervenes between the stopper 17 and the washer 18 and<br>
a cover body 19b that surrounds the stopper 17. The cover body 19b<br>
is provided with a plurality of caulking portions 19c that are<br>
engaged with the stopper 17. With this structure, the stopper 17<br>
is prevented from being disengaged from the small-diameter portion ft<br>
12b.<br>
In the conventional starter magnet switch structured as described above, because no means are provided for sufficiently regulating the movement of the stopper 17 radially of the rod 12, there is a fear that the stopper 17 will move radially due to<br><br>
vibrations or the like. Then, where the stopper 17 is repeatedly moved, it will come into contact with the cover 19 made of soft iron material, to wear the cover 19 worn from the inside. As a result, there is a fear that the cover 19 may be damaged by use over a long period of time, and the stopper 17 may be come disengaged due to the damaged cover 19.<br>
Also, because the caulking portions 19c are formed in the cover body 19b, there is a fear that portions 19d between the respective caulking portions 19c (Fig. 12) will expand radially, shortening the creepage distances between the fixed contacts 3, 4 as well as the movable contact 15 and the cover body 19b with the result that the cover body 19b and the fixed contacts 3, 4 as well as the movable contact 15 are short-circuited.<br>
SUMMARY QF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and therefore has an object to provide a starter magnet switch with which movement of the stopper can be more surely prevented, thereby preventing the cover from being damaged and the stopper*from being disengaged. Further, with this starter magnet switch, short-circuits due to the cover can also be prevented.<br>
To this end, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a starter magnet switch, comprising: a fixed iron core; a movable iron core which is allowed to reciprocate in a<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, a description will be given in more detail of preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing a starter magnet switch in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, a switch case 2 is connected to one end portion of a cylindrical solenoid case 1. A pair of fixed contacts 3 and 4 are fixed at a given interval within the switch case 2. A pair of conductors 5 and 6 are electrically connected to the fixed contacts 3 and 4, respectively.<br>
A cylindrical bobbin 7 is accommodated within the solenoid case 1- A coil 8 is held on the outer peripheral portion of the bobbin 7. A fixed iron core 9 is fixed within the solenoid case 1. The fixed iron core 9 includes a flange portion 9a which is in contact with an end surface of’ the bobbin 7 at the switch case 2 side and a cylindrical portion 9b which is inserted into the bobbin 7.<br>
A movable iron core 10 that slidably reciprocates is inserted into the bobbin 7. One end portion of the movable iron core 10 is brought in or out of contact with the end surface of the cylindrical portion 9b. Also, the other-end portion of the movable iron core<br>
10	projects externally from the solenoid case 1. An opening spring<br>
11	that urges the movable iron core 10 in a direction where the movable iron core 10 is dissociated from the fixed iron core 9 is disposed between the other end portion of the movable iron core 10 and the solenoid case.<br><br>
One end portion of the movable iron core 10 is fixed with a rod 12 that extends axially of the movable iron core 10 and reciprocates together with the movable iron core 10. The rod 12 includes a large-diameter portion 12a fixed onto the movable iron core 10 and a small-diameter portion 12b adjacent to the large-diameter portion 12a.<br>
Fig. 2 is a front view showing a leading portion of the rod 12 shown in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line III-III of Fig. 2. The small-diameter portion 12b of the rod 12 is equipped with a holding member 13 that can reciprocate in an axial direction of the small-diameter portion 12b. The holding member 13 includes a flange portion 13a and a cylindrical portion 13b. A ring-shaped holding plate 14 is abutted against an end surface of the cylindrical portion 13b.<br>
A plate-shaped movable contact 15, which is brought in or out of contact with the pair of fixed contacts 3 and 4^ is supported by the rod 12. The movable contact 15 is disposed between the flange portion 13a and the holding plate 14 . A contact spring 16 that urges the movable contact 15 toward-the fixed contacts 3 and 4 is disposed between the large-diameter portion 12a of the rod 12 and the holding member 13.<br>
An annular mounting groove 12c is defined in the outer periphery of the leading portion of a small-diameter portion 12b. The mounting groove 12c is equipped with a stopper 21 that regulates<br><br>
the movement of a movable contact 15 toward the axial direction of a rod 12. The stopper 21 includes a pair of semicircular pieces 21a and 21b which are semi-annular and mounted on mounting grooves 12c so as to surround the rod 12 in a state where those semicircular pieces 21a and 21b are opposed to each other. Those semicircular pieces 21a and 21b are made of a metal that has been hardened by-quenching or the like, respectively.<br>
A washer 18 is inserted into the small-diameter portion 12b between the stopper 21 and a holding plate 14. A cover 22 is made of metal softer than that of the stopper 21 and inserted into the small diameter portion 12b between the washer 18 and the stopper 21. The cover 22 includes a ring portion 22a that intervenes between the stopper 21 and the washer 18 and a cylindrical cover body 22b that surrounds the stopper 21.<br>
A plurality of projections 22c that regulate the relative axial movement of the stopper 21 with respect to the cover 22 are disposed circumflex eventually at given intervals inside the cover body 22b. The projections 22c may be formed in continuous rings in a circumpherential direction. The projections 22c are disposed at positions apart from the ring portion 22a by the thickness of the stopper 21 so as to be engaged with the stopper 21.<br>
Next, the operation of the starter magnet switch thus structured will be described.<br>
When a coil 8 is not excited, a movable iron core 10 is<br><br>
dissociated from a fixed iron core 9 due to the spring force of an opening spring 11, and the movable contact 15 is also dissociated from the fixed contacts 3 and 4. For that reason, no current flows between the fixed contacts 3 and 4.<br>
On the other hand, when the coil 8 is excited, the movable iron core 10 is moved against the opening spring 11 leftward in Fig. 1 to abut against the fixed iron core 9. In this situation, the movable contact 15 is moved together with the rod 12 leftward in Fig- 1 to abut against the fixed contacts 3 and 4. As a result, the fixed contacts 3 and 4 are electric-ally connected to each other through the movable contact 15, and a current flows between the conductors 5 and 6,<br>
Also, because the movable iron core 10 and the rod 12 are moved by a given distance leftward in Fig, 1 even after the movable contact 15 abuts against the fixed contacts 3 and 4, a holding member 13 and the movable contact 15 are moved relatively rightward in Fig. 1 with respect to the rod 12, and a contact spring 16 is compressed. As a result, the movable contact 15 is brought in pressure contact with the fixed contacts 3 and 4.<br>
Further, the projections 22c are formed in advance by pressing the material of the cover 22 or the like before the ring portion 22a and the cover body 22b are formed- As shown in Fig. 4, when the cover 22 is put on the small-diameter portion 12b, the projections 22c are not engaged with the stopper 21, and the opening<br><br>
portion of the cover body 22b is enlarged. When the outer peripheral portion of the cover body 22b is tightly closed after the stopper 21 is mounted on the mounting groove 12c, the projections 22c are engaged against the stopper 21 as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In the magnet switch thus structured, the stopper 21 made up of the pair of semicircular pieces 21a and 21b is used so that the stopper 21 can be prevented from moving radially due to vibrations. As a result, wear and damage of the cover 22 due to, contact with the stopper 21 are prevented so that disengagement of the stopper 21 due to damage of the cover 2   can be prevented.<br>
Also, because the relative axial movement of the stopper 21 with respect to the cover 22 is regulated by the projections 22c, and the outer peripheral portion of the cover Jody 22b is not enlarged radially, the fixed contacts 3, 4 and the movable contact 15 are prevented from short-circuiting through the cover 22. Embodiment 2<br>
Next, Fig- 5 is a side view showing the main portion of a starter magnet switch in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 6 is a front view showing the rod and cover shown in Fig. 5. In the figures, a cover 23 includes a cylindrical cover body 23a that surrounds the stopper 21 • The cover body 23a is provided with a plurality of extensions 23b that are disposed circumferentially at given intervals and extend axially. Each of those extensions 23b is provided with a projection 23c that<br><br>
regulates the relative axial movement of the stopper 21 with respect to the cover 23. Other structures are identical with those in the first embodiment.<br>
Even with the cover 23 thus structured, the movement of the stopper 21 can be regulated, and the cover 23 can prevent the fixed contacts 3, 4 and the movable contact 15 from short-circuiting. Embodiment 3<br>
Next, Fig. 7 is a side view showing the main portion of the starter magnet switch in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 8 is a front view showing the rod and cover shown in Fig. 7. In the figures, a cover 24 includes a cylindrical cover body 24a that surrounds the stopper 21. A plurality of extensions 24b that extend obliquely toward the radially inner side are disposed at an end portion of the cover body 24 circumflex eventually at given intervals. Other structures are identical with those in the first embodiment.<br>
Even with the cover 24 thus structured, the movement of the stopper 21 can be regulated, and the cover 24 can prevent the fixed contacts 3, 4 and the movable contact 15 from short-circuiting. Embodiment 4<br>
In the first embodiment, the projections 22c are engaged with the end surface of the stopper 21. Alternatively, for example, as shown in Fig. 9, recesses 21c into which the projections 22c are inserted may be defined in the outer peripheral surface of the<br><br>
stopper 21. As a result, the movement of the stopper 21 with respect to the cover 22 can be more surely regulated. Embodiment 5<br>
Next, Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view showing the main portion of the starter magnet switch in accordance with a fifth embodiment of the present invention- In the figure, a cover 25 includes a cylindrical cover body 25a that surrounds the stopper 21 - An end portion 25b of the cover body 25a is subjected, to rolling-caulking or the like so that the entire periphery thereof is uniformly bent radially inward. Other structures- are identical with those in the first embodiment.<br>
Even with the cover 2 5 thus structured, the movement of the stopper 21 can be regulated, and the cover 25 can prevent the fixed contacts 3, 4 and the movable contact 15 from short-circuiting.<br>
