				<td>MULTI-SHAFT EXTRUDER<br>
[0001] This invention relates to an extruder according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
[0002] Such extruders are known (EP 0788867 Bl; EP 0995566 Bl). The housing<br>
is divided into segments, The segments can be provided e.g. with material feed<br>
openings, gas outlet openings, heating means, cooling elements and the like to permit<br>
the extruder to be adapted flexibly to the material processing to be carried out in the<br>
particular case.<br>
[0003] Compared to a double-shaft extruder, such multi-shaft extruders with<br>
annularly disposed shafts have the advantage of having twice as many wedges on<br>
which material is processed particularly effectively by being transferred from the<br>
processing elements of one screw to the next. For example, an extruder with twelve<br>
shafts has 24 wedges, i.e. each shaft has two wedges associated therewith, while a<br>
double-shaft extruder has only two wedges, i.e. each shaft has only one wedge<br>
associated therewith. Being the effective processing zone, each wedge has heat<br>
produced thereon by additional stretching and compressing of the product. The high<br>
number of wedges thus leads in multi-shaft extruders to an increased accumulation of<br>
heat, which increases the temperature of the material to such an extent that the material<br>
can be overstressed. It is therefore known from WO 02/30652 A1 to form the housing<br>
in one piece and provide circumferentially distributed, axially parallel bores as cooling<br>
channels not only in the housing but also in the core.<br>
[0004] The problem of the invention is to ensure an optimal temperature for<br>
processing in the process chamber of a multi-shaft extruder having a housing<br>
constructed of segments, and a material temperature as low as possible upon discharge<br>
from the process chamber.<br>
[0005] This is achieved according to the invention by the extruder characterized in<br>
claim 1. The subclaims render advantageous embodiments of the inventive extruder.<br>
[0006] The inventive extruder has a core provided with cooling channels through<br>
which cooling liquid flows to ensure a heat exchange in the process chamber from the<br><br>
inside and cool it. At least one, but preferably two or more, segments of the housing<br>
are provided with circumferentially distributed, axially parallel cooling bores which<br>
are interconnected, each segment being provided with a connection for a cooling liquid<br>
feed and a connection for a cooling liquid drain through which cooling liquid is<br>
supplied to the cooling bores and discharged therefrom. The cooling bores are<br>
disposed on the portion of the segment facing the process chamber and thus as near as<br>
possible to the process chamber.<br>
[0007] The housing segment provided with the cooling bores has at the same time a<br>
heating means on the outside circumference. Each housing segment provided both<br>
with cooling bores and with a heating means preferably has a control device which<br>
controls both the heating means and the flow of cooling liquid through the cooling<br>
bores to permit adjustment of an optimal processing temperature and a material<br>
temperature as low as possible. The cooling liquid flow through the cooling bores can<br>
be controlled with a valve in the cooling liquid feed or drain. The temperature control<br>
device has a temperature sensor which is provided in the housing segment to<br>
determine the temperature in the process chamber. The heating means is used to heat<br>
the housing segment in question when the extruder is started to adjust the predefined<br>
operating temperature in the process chamber. If the operating temperature is exceeded<br>
during extrusion, the temperature control device switches the heating means off and<br>
cooling liquid is supplied to the cooling bores in the housing segment, controlled by<br>
the temperature control device, to maintain the predefined operating temperature<br>
pattern and control the heat removal differently from zone to zone. The housing<br>
generally consists of at least three housing segments, whereby preferably all, but in<br>
any case the majority, of the housing segments are adapted to be coolable and heatable<br>
in this way.<br>
[0008] The core assumes the temperature near the product from the process section<br>
and is therefore - unless an internal axial heat exchange takes place - near room<br>
temperature at the upstream conveying end and near the higher product outlet<br>
temperature at the downstream conveying end. By intensification of the axial heat<br>
transport with a corresponding choice of materials and their design or e.g. with the<br>
help of a viscous heat carrier, the product temperature can be lowered on the outlet<br><br>
side, on the one hand, and increased to the point of equalization in the direction of<br>
product feed, on the other hand. If a heat surplus is still present, it must be dissipated<br>
to the outside by the coolant, which can alternatively be effected at each end of the<br>
process section.<br>
[0009] The cooling channels of the core are preferably formed by an axial bore and<br>
an outside channel disposed spirally around the axial bore and extending near the<br>
process chamber. Both the axial bore and the spiral outside channel extend over the<br>
total, or at least most of, the process chamber and preferably serve to adjust a low<br>
material outlet temperature.<br>
[0010] The cooling liquid flows via a cooling liquid feed at the upstream conveying<br>
end of the core, which is adjacent the drive for the shafts, into the axial bore in the core<br>
and then in the conveying direction of the extruder to the downstream, conveying end<br>
portion of the core, where the product outlet openings are located. The downstream<br>
conveying end of the axial bore is connected to the downstream conveying end of the<br>
spiral outside channel, causing cooling liquid in the spiral outside channel to flow back<br>
to the cooling liquid drain at the upstream conveying end of the extruder in<br>
countercurrent to the conveying direction of the shafts.<br>
[0011] The process chamber of the extruder is preferably sealed with end plates on<br>
the downstream and upstream conveying ends. While the extrusion die is attached to<br>
the downstream conveying end plate, the upstream conveying end plate is preferably<br>
penetrated by the core, the cooling liquid feed and cooling liquid drain to and from the<br>
cooling channels in the core being provided on the end portion of the core protruding<br>
from the upstream conveying end plate.<br>
[0012] The core could be executed in one piece for non-wearing products, but as a<br>
rule it consists of a hollow drilled mandrel containing a well-fitting distributor on<br>
whose surface the desired cooling channel pattern is incorporated preferably in a spiral<br>
shape. The mandrel bears segments positioned in rotationally fast fashion whose outer<br>
form again partly encloses the axially parallel screws with little play.<br><br>
[0013] For connecting the cooling liquid feed and drain, an annular segment is<br>
disposed on the upstream conveying end of the core, which protrudes from the<br>
upstream conveying end plate, said segment being provided with radial bores for<br>
connection to the axial bore and the outside channel. The annular segment with the<br>
radial bores can be formed as a plate through which the shafts for the drive extend.<br>
[0014] The outside channel is preferably formed by a spiral groove on the outside<br>
circumference of the distributor, which is sealed from the process chamber by the<br>
mandrel. The radial bores for connecting the cooling liquid feed and drain are guided<br>
through the mandrel.<br>
[0015] The mandrel preferably has sleeve-shaped segments disposed thereon in<br>
rotationally fast fashion e.g. by splining with the mandrel so as to form the axially<br>
parallel, circular segment shaped recesses. Since the sleeve-shaped segments are<br>
usually exposed to different wear on the inner side of the process chamber, they can<br>
thus be selectively replaced.<br>
[0016] The housing segments can partly have radially extending openings for<br>
connecting the process chamber to the outer surroundings in order to supply<br>
substances to the process chamber or remove them therefrom, for example gases. The<br>
openings preferably extend horizontally, thus being disposed on the side of the<br>
housing, or vertically, i.e. upward or downward. The openings can be provided with<br>
fixed fittings, for example a funnel, or movable fittings, for example a screw conveyor.<br>
They can also be sealed when they are not needed.<br>
[0017] The housing segments can be interconnected by flanges. However, they are<br>
preferably held together tightly by tie-rods with prestressing. At least three tie-rods<br>
offset at an angle of 120° are preferably provided to obtain high contact pressure on<br>
the entire circumference between the segments. Because of the vertically and<br>
horizontally extending openings in the housing segment, however, four tie-rods are<br>
preferably used which are offset by 45° from the horizontal or vertical.<br>
[0018] The tie-rods extend through axially parallel bores in the housing segments<br>
and thus at the same time serve to mutually position the housing segments radially.<br><br>
The tie-rods can also have a smaller diameter than the bores in the housing segments<br>
through which they are guided. To ensure the mutual radial positioning of the housing<br>
segments, a plurality of sleeve-shaped filler pieces are then slipped successively on the<br>
tie-rods. The sleeve-shaped filler pieces have the advantage that the housing segments<br>
can be removed singly upon dismantling of the housing, so that the housing does not<br>
fall apart as a whole when the pull rods are drawn out.<br>
[0019] The pull rods preferably attack at one end the downstream conveying<br>
housing segment and at the other end an annular plate provided on the downstream<br>
conveying side of the material feed opening. Said plate can be used to fasten the<br>
extruder to a machine frame. Thus the torque and tractive forces occurring in the<br>
housing during processing of the material are transmitted via this plate into the<br>
machine frame so as to bypass the housing segment with the material feed opening.<br>
Thus the housing segment with the material feed opening is not attacked by any<br>
appreciable axial or torsional forces. It can thus consist of two axially spaced plates<br>
between which a thin wall, for example made of sheet metal, is detachably fastened.<br>
This permits fast thorough cleaning of the screw elements on the shafts in the feed<br>
area, since the material which is still powdery in this area is frequently deposited<br>
firmly on the screws.<br>
[0020] The segment with the material feed opening is preferably followed on the<br>
downstream conveying side by a segment with a funnel-shaped inside wall tapering in<br>
the downstream conveying direction. Said funnel-shaped feed segment causes a ring of<br>
material to form around the shaft, which leads to uniform material distribution in the<br>
process chamber. The funnel-shaped feed segment can extend into the plate which is<br>
attacked by the pull rods at their ends.<br>
[0021] While the segmented housing and the core are fixed relative to each other<br>
radially and in the circumferential direction, the housing is formed to be axially<br>
movable relative to the core in order to compensate temperature differences between<br>
housing and core. For this purpose the housing can be mounted so as to be axially<br>
displaceable on the core on the upstream conveying side of the material feed opening.<br><br>
[0022] The housing segments between the plate which is supported on the machine<br>
frame, and the downstream conveying end plate usually consist oflong and short<br>
segments. The long segments are provided with the heating means and with the<br>
cooling bores. The short segments serve primarily to feed and remove substances and<br>
are therefore provided with openings for connecting the process chamber to the outer<br>
surroundings.<br>
[0023] As mentioned at the outset, the higher energy conversion in the wedge is<br>
fundamentally advantageous for uniform and intensive processing of the product.<br>
Particularly high pressure is often necessary for pressing the fully processed substance<br>
through a perforated plate, screen or the like at the product discharge. Because of the<br>
subsequently often relatively long residence time during shaping, the product<br>
temperature must be as low as possible. Since the wedge makes an essential<br>
contribution only to homogenization but not to pressure buildup, it is not absolutely<br>
necessary for the discharge area according to the invention. Since only the suitable<br>
screws are guided as single-shaft or twin screws up to the end of the housing and the<br>
others end before the discharge area, this finding is easy to utilize. A twelve-shaft<br>
extruder has twelve engagement zones and thus twenty-four wedges. If every third<br>
screw shaft, i.e. altogether four screws, end before the discharge area, four twin screws<br>
with four engagement zones or eight wedges result. If every second screw, i.e. six, end<br>
before the discharge area, six single-shaft screws remain up to the end of the housing,<br>
and the engagement zones or wedges are completely eliminated. This does not result in<br>
a reduction of delivery volume since the strand cross sections and likewise the number<br>
of strands remain unchanged. For example, a twelve-shaft ring extruder equipped with<br>
double-threaded screws divides the product into twelve strands of material, the same<br>
as a twin screw divides it into three strands of material, and a single-shaft extruder into<br>
two strands of material. With four twin screws and six single-shaft extruders there are<br>
always twelve strands of material which, while the product is in the process section,<br>
are divided up as in the twelve-shaft extruder. Under the same operating conditions,<br>
the lowest material outlet temperature is obtained substantially in the single-shaft<br>
extruder, and the highest in the twelve-shaft extruder.<br><br>
[0024] Since the shafts ending before the discharge segment arc exposed to lower<br>
pressure, more economical axial bearings can also be used for said shafts.<br>
[0025] Hereinafter an embodiment of the inventive extruder will be explained more<br>
precisely by way of example with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
[0026] Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through the extruder;<br>
[0027] Figures 2 to 6 show cross sections along the lines II-II, III-III, IV-IV, V-V<br>
and VI-VI;<br>
[0028] Figures 7 and 9 show cross sections through the housing segment in the<br>
flange;<br>
[0029] Figure 8 shows a developed representation of the cooling channels of the<br>
housing segment according to Figures 7 and 9;<br>
[0030] Figure 10 shows a partial view of another embodiment of the extruder in<br>
longitudinal section;<br>
[0031] Figure 11 shows a cross section along the line XII-XII in Figure 10 as a twin<br>
screw discharge; and<br>
[0032] Figure 12 shows a cross section corresponding to Figure 11 for a single-shaft<br>
discharge,<br>
[0033] According to Figure 1 and Figures 2 to 4, the extruder has in a housing 1 a<br>
process chamber 2 which extends along a circle (Figures 2 to 4). A plurality of axially<br>
parallel shafts 3 are disposed in the process chamber 2. The chamber 2 extends<br>
between the housing 1 and an axial core 4.<br>
[0034] The process chamber 2 is sealed on both faces by end plates 5,6. The shafts<br>
3 extend through the upstream conveying end plate 5, being driven codirectionally by<br>
a drive section not shown in the drawing. The material outlet openings 7 are provided<br>
in the downstream conveying end plate 6.<br><br>
[0035] A plurality of screw or similar processing elements 8 are disposed in<br>
rotationally fast fashion on each shaft 3. According to Figures 2 to 4, the screw<br>
elements 8 of adjacent shafts 3 mesh with little play, i.e. largely tightly.<br>
[0036] The housing 1 is provided on its inner side with axially parallel, concave,<br>
circular segment shaped longitudinal depressions 12, while the segments 11 of the core<br>
4 likewise have accordingly formed axially parallel, concave, circular segment shaped<br>
longitudinal depressions 13. The longitudinal depressions 12, 13 which the screw<br>
elements 8 engage with little play, i.e. largely tightly, serve to mount and guide the<br>
shafts 3. Between two adjacent longitudinal depressions 12; 13 on the inner side of the<br>
housing 1 and the outer side of the segments 11, wedges 14, 15 are formed on which<br>
the material to be extruded is transferred from the processing elements 8 of one shaft 3<br>
to the next shaft 3.<br>
[0037] The housing 1 is composed of a plurality of longer annular housing segments<br>
16 to 19 and shorter annular housing segments 21, 22 disposed therebetween. The<br>
upstream conveying housing segment 19 is followed by an annular plate 23 which is<br>
mounted on a machine frame not shown.<br>
[0038] The plate 23 has protruding thereinto a feed segment 24 with an inside wall<br>
tapering in a funnel shape on the downstream conveying side. This is followed on the<br>
upstream conveying side by a filler housing segment 25 with a material feed opening<br>
26 and the end plate 5 fastened thereto. The filler housing 25 has on the underside a<br>
cleaning opening which can be opened in readily accessible fashion with a cover 57.<br>
[0039] The segments 16 to 19 are each provided on their outside circumference with<br>
electric heating means 27. Further, each housing segment 16 to 19 has on its portion<br>
facing the process chamber 2 circumferentially distributed, interconnected, axially<br>
parallel cooling bores 28 through which a coolant flows. To control the electric heating<br>
means 26 and the cooling circuit 28, each housing segment 16 to 19 has associated<br>
therewith a temperature control device not shown.<br>
[0040] The core 4 is of coolable and preferably multisectional design. The hollow<br>
drilled mandrel 9 bears the segments 11 which are positioned in rotationally fast<br><br>
fashion via a keying. The mandrel 9 contains a well-fitting distributor 99 provided<br>
with an axial bore 29 and a spiral outside channel 31. At the upstream conveying end<br>
the distributor 99 is provided with a cooling liquid feed 32 to the axial bore 29 and a<br>
cooling liquid drain 33 from the outside channel 31.<br>
[0041] The core 4 penetrates the upstream conveying end plate 5 so as to be axially<br>
freely displaceable and has on the free end an annular segment 34 which leads with a<br>
radial bore for the cooling liquid feed 32 to the axial bore 29, and the outside channel<br>
31 to the cooling liquid drain 33.<br>
[0042] The shorter segments 21 and 22 and the long downstream conveying<br>
segment 16 are provided with radial openings 38, 39, 40 extending vertically upward.<br>
Further, the segment 21 has two lateral, horizontally extending radial openings 41, 42<br>
according to Figure 4. The upwardly extending opening 40 in the segment 16 and the<br>
lateral openings 41, 42 in the segment 21 are sealed by stoppers 43, 44, 45. The<br>
opening 39 in the segment 22 is provided with a fitting 46 with a screw conveyor.<br>
[0043] The housing segments 16 to 19, 21, 22 on the downstream conveying side of<br>
the plate 23 are held together tightly with prestressing by tie-rods 48. According to<br>
Figure 4, four bores 49 are provided in the housing segments for receiving four tie-<br>
rods 48. The pull rods 48 attack at one end the downstream conveying housing<br>
segment 16 and at the other end the plate 23. For this purpose the downstream<br>
conveying end of the rod has screwed thereto a nut 51 which is supported on the<br>
housing segment 16. At the upstream conveying end the pull rods 48 have screwed<br>
thereto a further nut 52 in a recess in the plate 23, which is penetrated by clamp bolts<br>
53 which are supported in the recess 54 on the plate 23.<br>
[0044] Fastened to the end plate 6 with the outlet openings 7 is a plate 61 which<br>
bears the extruder head not shown. Number 62 designates a suspension permitting the<br>
extruder head to be removed. The nuts 37 provided in the end plate 6 fix the core 4<br>
relative to the housing 1 axially, radially and circumferentially. Screw bolts 65 are<br>
used to fasten the end plate 5, the filler housing 25 with the material feed opening 26<br>
and the feed housing 24 with the funnel-shaped inside wall to the plate 23. Sleeve-<br>
shaped filler pieces 63 are slipped on the pull rods 48 (Figure 5). The recesses 64 on<br><br>
the faces of the wearing segments 11 make it easier to remove the latter from the<br>
mandrel 9.<br>
[0045] The housings 16 to 19 have separate cooling and hearing circuits. Figures 7<br>
and 9 show cross sections through one of said housings. The housing itself is shown<br>
for flange execution but it can also be executed with a solid outer cross section with<br>
tie-rods. A wear-resistant steel is characterized by great hardness and is therefore<br>
required on the product-wetted inner side of the housing. This material can either be<br>
produced by powder metallurgy and sinter-fused under pressure and temperature, or a<br>
separate inside body has been produced which is shrunk and/or bonded into the<br>
surrounding actual housing. The outer housing is a softer, tenacious and, according to<br>
the invention here, not necessarily weldable steel in which the axially parallel cooling<br>
bores 1 to 12 are incorporated. The bores C-F-I-L are provided for the dowel pins or<br>
the tie-rods and the frontal tapholes B-D-G-K are used for drilling the internal<br>
connections between two adjacent peripheral cooling bores 1-2, 5-6, 8-9 and 10-11.<br>
This results in four internally linked cooling circuits 1-2-3, 4-5-6, 7-8-9, 10-11-12<br>
which are to be linked via outer connections, e.g. via the bridges B-C and H-J. The<br>
usual welding of the connections between the cooling bores 1 to 12 is only possible<br>
with separately produced inside bodies, since when an inner wearing layer is applied it<br>
would otherwise be partially destroyed and the whole housing rendered useless.<br>
[0046] In the embodiment according to Figures 1 to 6, the discharge of the extruder<br>
is formed by the portion with the housing segment 16, whereby all twelve screws 3 (cf.<br>
Figure 4) extend up to the end plate 6. In contrast, according to the embodiment of<br>
Figures 10 and 11, a special discharge segment 85 is provided, whereby two adjacent<br>
shafts 3 extend through corresponding bores in the discharge segment 85 up to the end<br>
plate 6, while the two adjacent shafts 3, one of which can be seen in Figure 1, end at<br>
the discharge segment 85 as does the core 4. That is, every third one of the twelve<br>
shafts 3 according to Figure 4 extends only up to the discharge segment 85. Thus, the<br>
twelve shafts 3 which the extruder has according to Figure 4 form four double shafts<br>
86 in the discharge segment 85, as evident from Figure 11.<br><br>
[0047] The core 4 is connected axially to the discharge segment 85 and fixed<br>
radially antirotationally with a screw 87. Figures 10 and 11 show the discharge<br>
segment 85 in one piece, but it can also be multisectional. For example, the core can<br>
also extend into or through the discharge segment 85.<br>
[0048] The discharge segment 85 is provided with a heating means 27 on the<br>
outside circumference in the same way as the housing segments 16, 17, etc., and<br>
further with cooling bores 28 which are formed in the same way as the above-<br>
described cooling bores 28 in the housing segments 16 to 19.<br>
[0049] The embodiment according to Figure 12 differs from that according to<br>
Figure 11 substantially in that the product discharge is not effected by four twin screws<br>
86 but by six single screws 3, since every second single screw 3 ends before the<br>
discharge segment 85. It is also possible to provide both twin screws and single screws<br>
in the discharge segment 85.<br><br>
