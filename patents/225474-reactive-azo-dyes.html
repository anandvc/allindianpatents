				<td>REACTIVE AZO DYES<br>
This invention relates to reactive azo dyes containing each<br>
of a triazine ring and at least one reactive vinyl sulphone<br>
group (or precursor thereof) and at least two azo groups.<br>
Such dyes are disclosed in, for example, EP-A-0623655, EP-<br>
A-0685532 and EP-A-076469 and typical dyes are as follows:-<br>
However, none of the dyes disclosed in the abovementioned<br>
documents provide a particularly strong or bright yellow or<br>
reddish yellow shade with good migration properties,<br>
excellent build-up and good fastness properties.<br>
Thus, the problem addressed by the invention is to provide<br>
such a dye capable of giving, particularly on cellulosic<br>
fabrics, a strong, bright yellow or reddish yellow shade<br>
with good migration properties, excellent build-up and<br>
which dyes are particularly easy and economical to produce.<br>
We find surprisingly that it is possible to solve the<br>
abovementioned problems by the use of an azo dye<br>
containing, on the one hand, a monoazo dye component based<br>
on sulpho-J-acid as coupling component and a markedly<br>
electron deficient aromatic amine as diazo component and,<br>
on the other hand, an azo dye component containing each of<br>
a phenylene group and an aromatic group or hetero aromatic<br>
group, each dye component being linked, via an amino<br>
linkage to a triazine group, the second dye component being<br>
so linked via the phenylene group.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect the invention provides an azo<br>
dye of the formula (I)<br><br>
or an alkali metal salt thereof:<br>
wherein: each of Rl and R2 independently is hydrogen,<br>
optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl or optionally substituted<br>
phenyl;<br>
in which formula (i) , c is zero or 1;<br>
in which formula (ii), d is 1, 2 or 3 and a group SO3H is<br>
ortho to the azo group; and<br>
in which formula (i) or (ii), Y is the group -CH=CH2;<br>
-CH2CH2U (wherein U is a leaving group) ; or -CH2CH=CH2;<br>
B is fluorine; chlorine; the group OR3 (in which R3 is<br>
hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or phenyl) ; the group NR4R5 (in which<br>
each of R4 and R5 independently is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or<br>
phenyl; or each of R4, R5 and N together form an optionally<br>
substituted aromatic heterocvclic ring); the group NR6R7R9<br>
(in which each of R6, R7 and R8 independently is C1-4 alkyl<br>
or phenyl or each of R6, R7 and R8 and N together form an<br>
optionally substituted aromatic heterocylcic ring); or the<br>
group SR9 (in which R9 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or phenyl) ;<br>
C is an optionally substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic<br>
residue;<br>
D is methyl, methoxy, amino, acylamino or ureido;<br>
a is zero, 1 or 2;<br>
b is zero, 1 or 2 and when b is 2 each D is<br>
independent of the other.<br>
Preferably, the substituent D is methyl, methoxy, acylamino<br>
or ureido and the substituent B is preferably chlorine or a<br>
3- or 4- carboxypyridinium salt derived respectively from<br>
nicotinic and isonicotinic acid.<br>
In the above dye, the group A preferably has the formula<br><br>
wherein e is -SO2CH2CH2OSO3H and f is absent; or<br>
e is -SO3H and f is -SO2CH2CK2OSO3H.<br>
A preferred azo dye has the formula<br><br>
wherein each of R2, C, D a, b, e and f is as defined above.<br>
More preferably in the azo dye of the formula (I1), at<br>
least one of the groups SO3H or D is ortho to the azo group<br>
linking to the group C.<br>
In one range of dyes of the formula (I1) which is<br>
preferred, a is 1 or 2 and b is zero. More preferably, the<br>
group C is a heteroaromatic group, still more preferably a<br>
pyridonyl, pyrazolonyl, 2,6-diaminopyridinyl or 4-carboxy-<br>
2,6-dihydroxypyridinyl group, or is a hydroxynaphthalene<br>
group.<br>
In another range of dyes of the formula (I) which is<br>
preferred a is zero or 1,. b is 1 or 2 and D, or each D<br>
independently, is ureido, (C1-4 alkyl) carbonylamino,<br>
C1-4 alkoxy or C1-4 alkylthio.<br>
For such dyes within this other range, a preferred group C<br>
has the formula (iv)<br><br>
wherein Ar1 is an aromatic diazo component;<br>
g is zero, 1, 2, 3 or 4;<br>
h is zero, 1, 2 or 3; and<br>
P, or each P independently, is C1-4 alkyl, nitro,<br>
-SO2NR8 (in which R8 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or phenyl),<br>
carboxyl, cyano, SO2Y1 (in which Y1 is vinyl, allyl or<br>
CH2CH2V, where V is a leaving grup) or -NHAr2 [in which Ar2<br>
is an aromatic residue substituted by at least one group T,<br>
the group T, or each group T independently, being selected<br>
from cyano, carboxyl, sulphonic acid and SO2Y2 (in which Y2<br>
is vinyl, allyl or CH2CH2W (where W is a leaving group)].<br>
More preferably, at least one group P is a group SO2Y1,<br>
where Y1 is as defined above or a group NHAr2 substituted<br>
by a group T, which group T is the group SO2Y2, in which Y2<br>
is as defined above.<br>
Preferred values of Y1 and Y2 independently are -CH=CH2;<br>
-CH2-CH=CH2; -CH2CH2C1, -CH2CH2Br; -CH2CH2F; -CH2CH2OSO3H;<br>
-CH2CH2SSO3H; -CH2CH2OCOCH3, -CH2CH2OPO3H2; -CH2CH2OCOC2H5;<br>
-CH2CH2OSO2NR9 (in which R3 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or<br>
phenyl); and -CH2CH2OSO2R10 (in which R10 is hydrogen, C1-4<br>
alkyl or phenyl).<br>
Another typical azo dye embodying the invention has the<br>
formula<br><br>
An azo dye of the formula (I), given and defined above may<br>
be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a<br>
triazine dye of the formula (II)<br><br>
wherein each of R1, A and B is as defined above and Hal is<br>
a halogen atom;<br>
with an azo dye of the formula (III)<br><br>
wherein each of a, b, R2, C and D is as defined above.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an aqueous<br>
solution at pH 4-6 and at a temperature of at least 30oC.<br>
The triazine dye of the formula (II) may be prepared by<br>
diazotising an amine of the formula (IV)<br>
A-NH2 (IV)<br>
wherein A is as defined above and coupling the diazotised<br>
amine of the formula (IV) to a triazine compound of the<br>
formula (V)<br><br>
wherein each of R1 and B is as defined above and Hal is a<br>
 halogen atom, to obtain the triazine dye of the formula<br>
(II) .<br>
Typically, diazotisation of the amine is carried out in an<br>
acid medium at a pH of about 2-5, using, for example,<br>
acetic, propionic or hydrochloric acid in the presence of a<br>
nitrosating agent, such as nitrosyl sulphuric acid, an<br>
alkali metal nitrite (e.g sodium nitrite) or a C1-4 alkyl<br>
nitrite (e.g. methyl nitrite) at a temperature of from "10°C<br>
to 10°C.<br>
The coupling reaction may be carried out by adding the<br>
diazotised amine of the formula (IV), to the triazine<br>
compound of the formula (V) in water at a temperature of<br>
from 0 to 10°C.<br>
The triazine compound of the formula (V), given and defined<br>
above, may be prepared by reacting an<br>
aminonaphthalenesulphonic acid compound of the formula (VI)<br><br>
with a cyanuric halide of the formula (VII)<br><br>
wherein each Hal is a halogen atom and B is as defined<br>
above, to form the triazine compound of the formula (V)<br>
The reaction may be carried out by adding the<br>
aminonaphthalene sulphonic acid compound of the formula<br>
(VI) dropwise to a slurry of the cyanuric halide of the<br>
formula (VII) in an ice/water/acetone mixture.<br>
When in the azo dye of the formula (III), a is 1 or 2, b is<br>
i<br>
zero and C is the residue of a heteroaromatic coupling<br>
component the azo dye of the formula (III) may be prepared<br>
by acylating a diamine of the formula (VIII)<br><br>
where a is zero, 1 or 2 to form an amine of the formula<br>
(IX), <br>
where a is zero, 1 or 2 and Ac is an acyl group,<br>
diazotising the amino of the formula (IX) and coupling the<br>
diazotised amine to a coupling agent of the formula<br>
where C is as defined above to form, after deacetylation,<br>
the azo dye of the formula (III).<br>
When, in the azo dye of the formula (III), a is zero or 1,<br>
b is 1 or 2 and D, or each D independently, is ureido,<br>
(C1-4 alkyl) carbonyl amino, C1-4 alkoxy or C1-4 alkylthio and<br>
the group C is a group_(iv)<br><br>
wherein each of Ar1, P, g, and h is as defined above, the<br>
azo dye of the formula (III) may be prepared by diazotising<br>
an amine of the formula (X)<br><br>
wherein each of Ar1, P, g and h is as defined above, and<br>
coupling the diazotised amine with a coupling agent of the<br>
formula (XI)<br><br>
where D is as defined above, a is zero or 1 and b is 1 or<br>
2.<br>
In either of the above reactions, the diazotisation and<br>
coupling may be carried out in a manner analogous to that<br>
described in relation to the preparation of the triazine<br>
dye of the formula (II).<br>
Dyes embodying the invention may be applied alone or in<br>
admixture with other dyestuffs.<br>
Although in this specification, dye formulae have been<br>
shown in the form of their free acid, the invention also<br>
includes dyes and processes using dyes in the salt form,<br>
particularly their salts with alkali metals such as the<br>
potassium, sodium, lithium or mixed sodium/lithium salt.<br>
The dyes may be used for dyeing, printing or ink-jet<br>
printing, for example of textile materials and paper.<br>
The process for colouration is preferably preformed at a pH<br>
of 7.1 to 13, more preferably 10 to 12 pH levels above 7<br>
can be achieved by performing the process for colouration<br>
in the presence of an acid-binding agent. They can be<br>
applied at any temperature from room temperaure (e.g. 15°C)<br>
to 80°C, preferably from 40 to 60°C.<br>
The substrate may be any of fibre material such as a<br>
textile material, leather, paper, hair or film, but is<br>
preferably a natural or artifiical textile material<br>
containing amino or hydroxyl groups, for example textile<br>
material such as wool, silk, polyamides and modified<br>
polyacrylonitrile fibres, and more preferably a cellulose,<br>
for example, that commercially available as Tencel. For<br>
this purpose the dyes can be applied to the textile<br>
materials at a pH above 7 by, for example, exhaust dyeing,<br>
padding or printing. Textile materials are coloured bright<br>
shades and possess good fastness to light and wet<br>
treatments such as washing.<br>
The new dyes are particularly valuable for colouring<br>
cellulosic textile materials. For this purpose, the dyes<br>
are preferably applied to the cellulosic textile material<br>
at a pH above 7 in conjunction with a treatment with an<br>
acid-brinding agent.<br>
Preferred acid-binding agents include alkali metal<br>
carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, metasilicates and <br>
mixtures thereof, for example sodium bicarbonate, sodium <br>
carbonate, sodium metasilicate, sodium hydroxide and the<br>
corresponding potassium salts. The dyes benefit from<br>
excellent build-up and high fixation.<br>
The new dyes can be applied to textile materials containing<br>
amine groups, such as wool and polyamide textile materials,<br>
from a neutral to mildly alkaline dyebath. The dyeing<br>
process can be carried out at a constant or substantially<br>
constant pH, that it to say the pH of the dyebath remains<br>
constant or substantially constant during the dyeing<br>
process, or if desired the pH of the dyebath can be altered<br>
at any stage of the dyeing process.<br>
The dyes may be in liquid or solid form, for example in<br>
granular or powdered form.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention there is<br>
provided a process for colouring a fibre material<br>
containing a group reactive with a reactive dye or a fibre<br>
blend containing the fibre material, which method comprises<br>
applying thereto a dye of the formula (I), given and<br>
defined above, preferably at a pH above 7.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be<br>
described in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples, in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise<br>
stated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of the dye:<br><br>
The process may be represented by the following reaction-<br>
scheme.<br>
A solution of 2-amino-5-hydroxy-l, 7-nachthalene disulphonic<br>
acid (50) (39.0g, 0.08mol) in water (500 mls) was added<br>
dropwise to a slurry of cyanuric chloride (51) (16.2g,<br>
0.088M) in an ice/water/acetone mixture and allowed to stir<br>
for 1 hr to provide a solution of the dichlorotriazinyl<br>
complex (52).<br>
Separately, 2N sodium nitrrte solution was added dropwise to<br>
an ice cold slurry of 2-amino-5- (b-sulphatoethylsulphone)<br>
benzenesulphonic acid (45.2g, 0.093M) (4) and concentrated<br>
HCl (30 mls) in water (500 mls) . After 1hr, excess nitrous<br>
acid was destroyed by the addition of sulphamic acid, leaving<br>
a solution of the diazonium salt (53) . The solution of the<br>
diazonium salt (53) was then added to the dichlorotriazine<br>
(53) solution and the mixture allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature while maintaining the pK at 5. After 4 hrs the<br>
resulting precipitate was filtered off and dried to give the<br>
reddish yellow dichlorotriazinyl dye (70g) (54). Analytical<br>
data were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
2N sodium nitrite solution was added dropwise to an ice cold<br>
solution of 2(2-sulpho-4-nitrophenylamino)-5-amino-l, 4-<br>
benzene disulphonic acid (6.9g, 0.01mol) and concentrated<br>
HC1 (3mls) in water (100mls). After 1hr, excess nitrous acid<br>
was destroyed by the addition of sulphamic acid leaving a<br>
solution of the diazonium salt (55). The solution of the<br>
diazonium salt (55) was then added to a slurry of meta-<br>
ureidoaniline (56) (2.8g, O.Olmol) in water (100 mls) and the<br>
mixture allowed to warm to room temperature over night<br>
maintained at pH 4. The product was precipitated by the<br>
addition of methylated spirits, filtered off and dried to<br>
give the monoazoamine dye (57) (9.1g). Analytical data were<br>
in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
An aqueous solution of dichlorotriazine dye (54) (5.0g,<br>
0.0045 mol) and monoazoamine dye (57) (5.6g, 0.0045 mol) in<br>
water (100 mls) maintained at pH 5 was heated at 6.5°C for 2<br>
hrs. The resulting solution was cooled and the product<br>
precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits. The<br>
precipitate was filtered off and dried to give the reactive<br>
dye (1) of Example 1 (6.6g) lmax = 470nm e = 76306.<br>
Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected<br>
structure.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of the dye:<br><br>
The process may be represented by the following reaction<br>
scheme.<br>
A solution of 2-amino-5-hydroxy-l,7-naphthalene disulphonic<br>
acid (50) (9.72g, 0.02mol) in water (100mls) was added<br>
dropwise to a slurry of cyanuric chloride (51) (4.1g, 0.022<br>
mol) in an ice/water/acetone mixture and allowed to stir for<br>
1 hr furnishing a solution of the dichlorotriazinyl complex<br>
(52) .<br>
A slurry of 6-amino-4-(b-sulphatoethylsulphone)-1, 3-<br>
benzenedisulphonic acid (16.5g, 0.037mol) and NaNO: (0.041<br>
mol) in water (150 mls) was added dropwise to ice/water<br>
(150g) and concentrated HCl. After 30 mins excess nitrous<br>
acid was destroyed with sulphamic acid, leaving a solution of<br>
the diazonium salt (58). 2/3 of the diazonium salt (58)<br>
solution was added to the dichlorotriacine solution and the<br>
mixture allowed to warm to room temperature maintaining the<br>
pH at 6. After 1 hr the resulting precipitate was filtered<br>
off and shown to be the dichlorotriazinyl intermediate (59).<br>
A solution of a monoazoamine dyebase (60) (0.007 mol) and the<br>
dichlorotriazine (59) (0.009 mol) in water (250 mls) was<br>
heated to 50°C and the pH maintained at 6 for 4 hrs. The<br>
product was precipitated by the addition of methylated<br>
spirits, filtered off and dried to give the reactive dye (2)<br>
of Example 2 (10.6g) lmax = 464nm e = 55500. Analytical data<br>
were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of the dye:<br>
The process may be represented by the following reaction<br>
scheme.<br>
2N NaNO2 (18mls, 0.036mol) was added dropwise to a solution of<br>
2-amino-5-acetamido-benzene sulphonic acid (14g, 0.033mol) in<br>
water (250 mls) with concentrated HCl (8.5mls), cooled to<br>
0°C. The solution was stirred cold for 2 hrs before<br>
destroying excess nitrous acid by addition of sulphamic acid,<br>
to give a solution of a diazonium salt (62).<br>
Half of the available diazonium salt solution (62) was added<br>
slowly to a stirred solution of citrazinic acid (63) (2.55g,<br>
0.015 mol) in water (100 mls) adjusted and maintained at pH7.<br>
After 30 mins the coupling was complete and a monoazo-N-<br>
acetylamino dye base was precipitated by the addition of<br>
isopropyl alcohol. The N-acetyl dyebase was then dissolved<br>
in 2N sodium hydroxide and heated at 60°C for 2 hrs before<br>
cooling and acidifying to pH2 with concentrated HC1 to<br>
precipitate a dark solid. The solid was filtered off and<br>
dried to give the monoazoamino dyebase (64).<br>
-An aqueous solution of a dichlorotriazine dye (61) (3g, 0.003<br>
mol/ "prepared as described in Example 1) and the monoazoamino<br>
dyebase (64) (1.2g, 0.003 mol) in water (100 mls) was<br>
adjusted to pH5 and heated at 60°C for 2 hrs. The product<br>
was precipitated by addition of methylated spirits, filtered<br>
off and dried to give the reactive dye (35) of Example 3 as<br>
an orange powder (3.5g) lmax = 4 60nm e = 62000. Analytical<br>
data were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of the dye:<br><br>
The proceess may be represented by the following reaction<br>
scheme.<br>
Reddish - yellow dichlorotriazinyl dye (54) was prepared as<br>
in Example 1. 2N sodium nitrite solution was added dropwise<br>
to an ice cold solution of 2-amino-5-(b-<br>
sulphatoethylsulphone) benzene-sulphonic-acid (16.75g, 0.025<br>
mol) and concentrated HCl (6mls) in water (200 mls). After 1<br>
hour, excess nitrous acid was destroyed by the addition of<br>
sulphamic acid leaving a solution of the diazonium salt (65) .<br>
The solution of the diazonium salt (65) was then added to a<br>
slurry of meta-ureidoaniline (56) (6.75g, 0.025 mol) in water<br>
(100 mls) and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature<br>
over 2 hours maintained at pH 5.5. The product was<br>
precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits, filtered<br>
off and dried to give the monoazoamine dye (66) (14.1g).<br>
Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected<br>
structure.<br>
An aqueous solution of the dichlorotriazinyl dye (54) (5.0g,<br>
0.0053 mol) and the monoazoamine dye (66) (5.4g, 0.0053 mol)<br>
in water (200 mls) maintained at pH5 was heated at 50°C for 5<br>
hours. The resulting solution was cooled and the product<br>
precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits. The<br>
precipitate was filtered off and dried to give the reactive<br>
dye (41) (6.0g) l max = 462nm e=50000. Analytical data were<br>
in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
Examples 5-45<br>
In each of the following dyes, a triazine ring carries<br>
respective first and second yellow monoazo dye components, a<br>
first of which is derived from sulpho-J-acid as a coupling<br>
component. The second yellow monoazo dye components are also<br>
derived from a coupling component and a diazotized amine<br>
component.<br>
The dyes of Examples 5-36 and 41-45 (dyes 3, 5-12, 14-16, 18-<br>
19, 21-34, 36 - 40 and 42 - 45) were prepared by the method<br>
of Example 1, so that the residue derived from the coupling<br>
component is linked to the triazine ring).<br>
The dyes of Examples 36 - 40 (dyes 4, 13, 17, 20 and 35) were<br>
prepared by the method of Example 3, so that the residue<br>
derived from the diazotised amine component is linked to the<br>
triazine ring.<br>
Each of the dyes of Examples 5-45 (dyes 3 - 34, 36 - 40 and<br>
42 - 45) has the formula<br>
The above reactive dyes embodying the invention contain a<br>
first monoazo component derived from sulpho-J-acid as<br>
coupling component and a strongly electron withdrawing diazo<br>
component giving a bright yellow shade, which may be matched<br>
and thereby enhanced by a second monoazo component, itself<br>
providing a bright yellow shade. Such dyes may thus be<br>
provided with an excellent strong and bright shade. They are<br>
found also to have excellent build-up and good migration<br>
properties and are relatively inexpensive, especially given<br>
the depth of shade achieved, and easy to prepare. They also<br>
exhibit beneficial fastness properties, especially excellent<br>
light and wash fastness.<br>
