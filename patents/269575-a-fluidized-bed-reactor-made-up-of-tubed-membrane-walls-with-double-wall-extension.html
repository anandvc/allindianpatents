Double wall extension<br>
The present invention concerns fluidised bed reactors such as boiler<br>
combustion chambers. These reactors consist of a combustion chamber<br>
usually made up of tubed membrane walls cooled by a coolant fluid such as a<br>
water/steam mixture.<br>
The part of the combustion chamber that can be rectangular is<br>
determined by the speed at which the combustion fumes ascend under<br>
correct working conditions. Since the periphery of the combustion chamber is<br>
fixed, the flow rate of the coolant fluid that can circulate within the wall tubes<br>
will be determined according to the diameter and the distance chosen for the<br>
said tubes. The height of the combustion chamber allows the thermal<br>
exchange surface of the four walls to be obtained, however this height must<br>
be optimised with the aim of reducing the height and thus the costs of<br>
installation but also in such a way that the time necessary for the chemical<br>
reactions between the particles takes place within the combustion chamber.<br>
According to the size of the installation and the required steam cycle,<br>
the combustion chamber section forms a perimeter that may be insufficient for<br>
the installation into the walls of the tubes in parallel, necessary for the<br>
circulation of the quantity of coolant fluid. In addition, the requirement for<br>
thermal exchange may necessitate the installation of additional exchange<br>
surfaces in the combustion chamber.<br>
One solution already known consists in adding single wall extension<br>
panels into the combustion chamber, such as described in patent FR 2 712<br>
378 of the applicant. These extension panels are vertical, tubed and have<br>
membranes, and are welded to the periphery walls and fed with coolant fluid<br>
in parallel or in series with the walls forming the exterior envelope of the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
However, these single wall extension panels are limited in height, in the<br>
number of tubes of which they are composed and in quantity due to the<br><br>
2<br>
minimum distance required between them, for reasons of stress and erosion<br>
by the ashes that circulate within the combustion chamber. The additional<br>
exchange surface is thus limited.<br>
These single wall extension panels are heated on both sides by the<br>
ashes and the gases which, in certain cases, may result in overheating of the<br>
tubes if there should be an imbalance between the thermal flux received from<br>
the fluidised bed circulating within the combustion chamber and the flow of<br>
coolant fluid that ensures cooling of the tubes.<br>
Another solution could be to increase the height of the combustion<br>
chamber in order to increase the exchange surface of the walls without adding<br>
internal extensions, but this solution is costly since the overall height of the<br>
installation is increased.<br>
The present invention proposes a solution to the problem of insufficient<br>
exchange surfaces in the combustion chamber at lower cost and without<br>
increasing the height of the installation.<br>
The fluidised bed reactor according to the invention is made up of<br>
tubed membrane walls cooled by a coolant fluid, these walls encircling a<br>
combustion chamber and comprising tubed extension panels through which<br>
flows a coolant fluid by single pass forced circulation. According to the<br>
invention the extension panels are paired two by two.<br>
The coolant fluid that flows in this way within the tubes in the walls and<br>
in the tubed extensions allows balancing of the thermal flux received from the<br>
fluidised bed circulating in the combustion chamber. The circulation is single<br>
pass, which means that all the tubes in the combustion chamber and the<br>
extensions have fluid flowing in parallel. Single pass circulation avoids long<br>
connecting pipework between the extension panels and the walls of the<br>
combustion chamber (at the top for exit from the panels and at the bottom for<br>
entry into the walls of the combustion chamber).   Thus, all that remains are<br><br>
3<br>
feed pipes at the bottom and emission pipes at the top for the panels and the<br>
walls of the combustion chamber.<br>
The invention allows just one side of each extension to be heated by<br>
the fluidised bed circulating in the combustion chamber, which allows a lower<br>
flow rate of coolant fluid since the second side of each of the extension panels<br>
paired in this way is not in contact with the ashes and the hot gases that make<br>
up the fluidised bed circulating in the combustion chamber, which avoids<br>
forms of heat transfer which can damage the mechanical behaviour of the<br>
tubes. On the other hand, by doubling the number of tubes in each extension<br>
panel, the part through which the coolant fluid circulating in these extensions<br>
passes increases in comparison to single extensions and the exchange<br>
surface is increased. These double wall extensions have better mechanical<br>
behaviour, it is possible to make them bigger.<br>
According to another arrangement, the extension panels are attached<br>
to the walls of the combustion chamber. This allows rigidity to be improved<br>
and panel deformation to be minimised, something which could give rise to<br>
erosion caused by solids descending as a layer along the walls.<br>
According to one variation, the extension panels go from the top of the<br>
reactor to a maximum height equal to 75% of the height of the combustion<br>
chamber. This is because it is in the upper area of the combustion chamber<br>
that the temperature is at its highest and that the risks of erosion are at a<br>
minimum since the concentrations of solids decrease with height and the<br>
gaseous atmosphere in the upper part of the combustion chamber is fully<br>
oxidising.<br>
According to another variation, the bottom of the combustion chamber<br>
is in the form of a divided combustion chamber, called a "pant leg". This<br>
shape allows the introduction of combustion air into the central area of the<br>
combustion chamber, in order to distribution this air well over the whole area<br>
of the combustion chamber.<br><br>
4<br>
According to a particular arrangement, the coolant fluid is in the liquid<br>
and/or gaseous phase according to the working thermal load of the boiler.<br>
The fluid is liquid when the load is low and gaseous when it is high.<br>
According to a particular arrangement, the coolant fluid is water.<br>
According to one variation, the extension panels form enclosures that<br>
include openings. In the case of an escape of coolant fluid from the tubes,<br>
these openings allow an increase in pressure inside the enclosure to be<br>
avoided.<br>
According to a particular arrangement, the extension panels are placed<br>
at least partly in the dense layer of solids. This is because it is within this area<br>
of high concentration of solids that thermal exchanges are at their highest.<br>
According to another arrangement, the tubes that make up the<br>
extension panels are of different dimensions to those of the wall tubes.<br>
According to an initial variation, the distance between two tubes making<br>
up the extension panels is fixed. This simplifies manufacture of the panels.<br>
According to a second variation, the distance between two tubes<br>
making up the extension panels is variable. This allows optimisation of the<br>
thermodynamic behaviour of the said panels and the temperature thresholds<br>
of the metal not to be exceeded.<br>
According to a third variation, the distance between two twin extension<br>
panels is equal to the distance between two tubes of the combustion chamber<br>
screening wall. In this way, manufacture of the assembly is simplified.<br>
According to another arrangement, the tubes in the extension panels<br>
have coolant fluid flowing through them in series with the periphery walls.<br>
This choice depends on the steam cycles and the thermal forces to be<br>
exchanged in the extension panels.<br><br>
5<br>
According to another particular arrangement, the extension panels are<br>
arranged on the partition walls that divide up the combustion chamber. This<br>
allows an increase in the number of extension panels and thus an increase in<br>
the number of exchange surfaces at lower cost.<br>
According to a variation, the partition walls go from the top of the<br>
reactor to a maximum height equal to 75% of the height of the combustion<br>
chamber. These double partition walls may be of the separated or close type<br>
according to the access rules for maintenance between the walls.<br>
It will be easier to understand the invention by reading the following<br>
description which is given solely by way of example and which has been<br>
drawn up by referring to the attached illustrations, where:<br>
-	Illustrations 1, 2, 3 and 4 show horizontal cross-section views of<br>
reactors equipped with extension panels according to the invention,<br>
-	Illustrations 5a to 5t are horizontal cross-section views that illustrate<br>
different types of extension panels possible,<br>
-	Illustration 6 is a horizontal cross-section view of double extension<br>
panels on a double partition wall of the close type.<br>
-	Illustration 7 is a horizontal cross-section view of double extension<br>
panels on a double partition wall of the separated type.<br>
-	Illustration 8 is a horizontal cross-section view of an example of a<br>
combustion  chamber comprising two double  partition  walls  and  double<br>
extension panels on the periphery walls and the partition walls,<br>
-	Illustration 9 is a vertical cross-section view of a double extension,<br>
-	Illustration 10 is a horizontal cross-section view of a double extension,<br><br>
6<br>
-	Illustrations 11a to 11d are vertical cross-section views of installation<br>
examples of double partition walls,<br>
-	Illustrations 12a to 12c are perspective views of installation examples<br>
of double partition walls,<br><br>
-	Illustration  13 is a vertical cross-section view of an installation<br>
example of double partition walls,<br>
-	Illustrations 14a to 141 are examples of different positions for entry<br>
and exit manifolds for the double partition walls.<br>
Illustrations 1 to 4 depict a fluidised bed reactor 1 made up of tubed<br>
membrane walls 2 cooled by a coolant fluid surrounding a combustion<br>
chamber 10. The walls 2 comprise tubed extensions 3. The wall 11 includes<br>
openings 5 that communicate with the cyclones (not depicted). These<br>
extensions may be arranged perpendicularly on the wall 11, as in illustration<br>
1, or parallel to the wall 11, as in illustration 2, or form combustion chamber 10<br>
partition walls 4, as in illustration 3, where the combustion chamber 10 is<br>
divided into three and illustration 3a where the combustion chamber is divided<br>
into two. In illustration 4, the combustion chamber 10 is divided into six.<br>
Illustrations 5 depict the different types of possible extension panels.<br>
This set of illustrations shows the variety of possible constructions that<br>
depend on the requirements for exchange surfaces and thermodynamic<br>
behaviour criteria, which themselves depend on the conditions of the gaseous<br>
liquid or water steam cycle. In particular, illustrations 5u to1 5t have only one<br>
tube at the end in order to reduce the thermal flux received by the tube and<br>
the end fin.<br>
1 5u as per original does not exist, could be 5a<br><br>
7<br>
Illustration 6 depicts details of a double partition wall 4 of the close type<br>
on which extension panels 3 have been arranged.<br>
Illustrations 7 and 8 depict a partition wall 4a of the separated type on<br>
which extension panels 3 have been arranged. Illustration 7 depicts the<br>
details of the wall 4a.<br>
By way of example, extension panel 3 is fed by a distribution circuit 30,<br>
it comprises tubes 31 which are held spaced apart by a curved sealing fin 32.<br>
The coolant fluid circulates in the tubes 31 of the entrance manifold 33<br>
towards the exit manifold 34 (cf. Illustration 9).<br>
Extension 3 depicted in illustration 10 is a cross-section view from the<br>
top. It is made up of tubes 31.<br>
The double partition wall 4 may be arranged in a different manner:<br>
either over the whole of the height as in illustration 11a, or only in the central<br>
portion as in illustration 11b, or up to an intermediate height as in illustration<br>
11c, or from the ceiling up to an intermediate height as in illustration 11d or<br>
illustration 12a.<br>
It is also possible to place several double partition walls 4 parallel as in<br>
illustrations 12b and 13, or which are intersected as in illustration 12c. It is<br>
thus possible to separate the combustion chamber 10 into several combustion<br>
sub-chambers 10a. Thus, it is possible to get a combustion chamber with six<br>
cyclones 5 and two parallel double partition walls 4 which divide the<br>
combustion chamber 10 into three combustion sub-chambers 10a, each one<br>
opening out onto two cyclones 5.<br>
Illustration 14 depicts the different arrangements of the entry and exit<br>
manifolds possible for double partition walls with walls of the close type<br>
(Illustrations 14h to 141) or of the separated type (14a to 14g). The choice of<br>
different arrangements for manifolds depends on the size of the partition walls<br>
and on optimisation of the distribution of coolant fluid in these walls.<br><br>
8<br>
The examples given  above may be extended to  non-rectangular<br>
section combustion chambers, as for example square, hexagonal, octagonal<br>
or circular sections.<br><br><br>
