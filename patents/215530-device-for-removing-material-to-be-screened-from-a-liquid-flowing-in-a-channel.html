side of the sieve grate, above the feeding hopper. Such devices having a rotatably driven<br>
sieve grate include holes or slits on the cylindrical surface having a size of about 4 to 12 mm.<br>
Consequently, especially rakings can be taken out of a liquid flowing in a channel. Fine<br>
components as sludge or the like cannot be treated with such a device. Fibrous material<br>
remains in the channel also often giving rise to clogging-up and even to breakdowns in the<br>
operation.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A device of the type mentioned above is known from DE 34 20 157 C1. The device includes<br>
a cylindrical sieve grate which is partially submerged in the liquid with its axis in inclined<br>
manner, the grate having a hydraulically open front side on the inflow side thereof and a<br>
hydraulically substantially closed back side on the outflow side thereof. The sieve grate<br>
comprises a perforation of slits forming a separation surface on the inner side, while the<br>
liquid penetrates the slits and remains in the channel. The cylindrical sieve grate is rotatably<br>
driven in connection with a screw conveyor. The screw conveyor has a feeding hopper being<br>
coaxially arranged in bearings with respect to the sieve grate. The screw conveyor includes a<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
housing and a conveying screw. A fixed detaching device in form of a brush roll or a spray<br>
rail for water for detaching the material to be raked and/or screened adhering to the<br>
separation surface inside the sieve grate is provided on the outer side of the sieve grate,<br>
above the feeding hopper. The rakings fall in the feeding hopper being the first element of<br>
 the screw conveyor and is upwardly conveyed to the discharge point outside and above the<br>
liquid. The cylindrical sieve grate comprises spiral guide plates arranged on the inner side of<br>
the grate having the function to convey upwardly especially larger rakings and to hinder them<br>
from falling back during rotation of the sieve grate. The openings of the perforation of the<br>
sieve grate may be designed to have a size from a number of millimetres to about 10 mm.<br>
Smaller openings cannot be produced economically. Consequently, the known device cannot<br>
be used to treat sludge-like screenings.<br>
A device for removing material to be raked and/or screened from a liquid flowing in a channel<br>
is known from DE 36 30 755 C2. The device includes a driven cylindrical sieve grate being<br>
positioned in inclined manner in the channel. A screw conveyor leads from a feeding hopper<br>
being arranged near the sieve grate to a discharge point outside the channel. The sieve<br>
grate comprises a number of ring-like discs being arranged side by side with distance to<br>
each other in order to form slits. A stripper bar forming a detaching device is positioned<br>
inside the sieve grate above the feeding hopper. The feeding hopper includes a wall<br>
upwardly extending to the stripper bar. The stripper bar may be positioned on the outside of<br>
the sieve grate also extending inwardly through the slits between the ring-like discs. There<br>
are constructive limits in the design due to the formation of the openings of the sieve grate in<br>
form of the number of ring-like discs. Consequently, this device can be used to remove<br>
rakings rather than screenings. Sludge cannot be screened using this device.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The object of the present invention is to provide a device of the kind described above which<br>
is adapted to screen sludge to be removed from a liquid flowing in a channel. Fabrics and<br>
other screenings of small dimension shall be removed also.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention that is achieved with the features of claim 1.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention deviates from the prior art concerning sieve grates made from a cylindrically<br>
bent sheet metal having openings in the shape of slits or holes or made from ring-like discs<br>
being arranged side by side with distance to each other. The sieve grate is designed to have<br>
two elements, one being a mesh fabric forming the separation surface on its inner side to<br>
deposit the sludge-like screenings. Such a mesh fabric is a very economical possibility to<br>
realize the openings of the separation surface to have a different size compared with the<br>
possibilities given by forming slits between ring-like discs or to arrange holes or bores in<br>
sheet metal. Each mesh of a mesh fabric has a constant cross section area. A mesh fabric<br>
can be produced easily to have the proper dimensioning of openings of such sizes necessary<br>
to remove sludge-like screenings. The openings may be designed to be very small and<br>
uniform. Sizes of parts of millimetres are realistic. On the other hand such a mesh fabric has<br>
certain instability to hold a constant diameter of the sieve grate. The mesh fabric is assisted<br>
by a shaping carrier element or supported by them respectively making the cylindrical shape<br>
of the sieve grate to be permanent. It is evident that the shaping carrier element has larger<br>
openings than the mesh fabric to be penetrated by the liquid. These opening are of no<br>
importance concerning the separation surface of the mesh fabric.<br>
A fixed detaching device for detaching the material to be screened adhering to a separation<br>
surface inside the sieve grate is provided outside the circumference of the sieve grate and<br>
outside the liquid level in the channel. The detaching device should include a spray rail to<br>
remove the material to be screened adhering to the separation surface inside the sieve grate<br>
and being conveyed upwardly during rotation of the sieve grate and being thrown into the<br>
feeding hopper. Doing this spray water enters the feeding hopper also. Liquid from the<br>
channel is conveyed upwardly also when conveying the screenings, the liquid entering the<br>
feeding hopper also. The screenings deposited with the mesh fabric on the separation<br>
surface agglomerates by the use of a spray rail being the detaching device and enters the<br>
feeding hopper. The feeding hopper has to have openings arranged in its bottom part to<br>
achieve a pre-dewatering in the feeding hopper. The liquid from the pressing zone of the<br>
screw conveyor is conveyed back into the channel through these openings also.<br>
The separation surface is completed by guide plates. The guide plates are designed to form<br>
troughs to convey the mixture of screenings and liquid upwardly. The guide plates are<br>
divided by separation walls arranged along the length of the plates to form singles conveying<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
troughs. A wall can be arranged at the end of the guide plates also. Consequently, single<br>
portions of the mixture of liquid and screenings are upwardly conveyed. Liquid flows out of<br>
the single troughs giving an increase of concentration of screenings. In an especially easy<br>
embodiment the guide plates being arranged in sealed manner with respect to the separation<br>
surface are no longer spiralic but arranged in parallel to the axis and with respect to the inner<br>
circumference of the separation surface thus forming shovel-like troughs conveying the<br>
screenings upwardly during rotation of the sieve grate. The single troughs of a guide plate<br>
one after the other emerge the liquid level in the channel due to the inclined arrangement of<br>
the axis of the device. The liquid emerges the mesh fabric below and above the liquid level in<br>
the channel resulting in a concentrating of the screenings in the troughs. There occurs a<br>
further concentration of the screenings during upwardly conveying due to the change of the<br>
liquid level of the mixture of liquid and screenings in the troughs and due to the decrease of<br>
volume provided by the troughs. This concentration of the material to be screened is<br>
necessary to treat such sludge material. However, -it is possible also to arrange the guide<br>
plates not in parallel to the axis but in parallel to the liquid level in the channel with respect to<br>
the separation surface. Doing this the separation walls can be avoided. However the end<br>
walls are necessary and the angle of arrangement of the device in the channel is fixed. If the<br>
angle of the arrangement of the device in the channel should be variable then the separation<br>
walls are necessary to form single trough-like chambers on the guide plates.<br>
The conveying screw of the screw conveyor may be provided with brushes in the region of<br>
the sieve grate, the brushes stroking the pierced feeding hopper. The brushes are positioned<br>
on the outer circumference of the conveying screw and have the function to clean again and<br>
again the openings arranged in the bottom part of the feeding hopper during operation of the<br>
device to achieve a constant pre-dewatering of the deposited screenings. The device can be<br>
operated discontinuously also in order to reach a certain deposition of material on the<br>
separation surface of the mesh fabric during standstill periods of the sieve grate. Doing this a<br>
certain damming of the liquid occurs in the channel and a greater part of the separation<br>
surface of the sieve grate is used even though the sieve grate with its axis is arranged in<br>
inclined manner in the channel. A part of the bottom of the feeding hopper being perforated is<br>
arranged below the liquid level in the channel. This perforated bottom is used for depositing<br>
purposes also. During time periods in which the sieve grate is driven in rotation a cleaning<br>
action of the perforated bottom of the feeding hopper takes place again in connection with a<br>
decrease of damming of the liquid in the channel.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
The guide plates may be designed to be open on the side not facing the mesh fabric with<br>
respect to the separation surface. The openings may be designed to be comb-like or to be<br>
composed of bores, slits or the like. Especially liquid penetrates these openings when the<br>
guide plates are upwardly moved during rotation of the sieve grate prior to reaching the<br>
detaching device. A concentration of the deposited sludge-like screenings occurs due to this<br>
design.<br>
The shaping carrier element may be realized in different manner. A supporting fabric may be<br>
provided having comparatively larger meshes but holding the shape after bending operation<br>
and causing the mesh fabric to hold its shape. The mesh fabric can be fixed with the<br>
supporting fabric in areas or point-like connections. However, it is possible also to use a<br>
basket having arms and struts for the shaping carrier element also, the basket being<br>
designed to receive the mesh fabric along its inner circumferential surface.<br>
The detaching device should comprise nozzles to spray water and/or compressed air. One or<br>
more spray rails may be arranged in parallel to the surface line of the cylindrical sieve grate.<br>
The nozzles have the function that the shaping carrier element is penetrated by the spray<br>
water and/ort he compressed air resulting in a loosening of the deposited screenings from<br>
the separation surface and a throwing in the feeding hopper.<br>
The feeding hopper in axial direction may be designed to be offset or longer than the axial<br>
extension of the sieve grate as to the inclined arrangement of the axis of the device. Doing<br>
this, the feeding hopper extends through the open front side of the sieve grate in a certain<br>
amount. However it is possible also to position an upwardly extending end wall on the<br>
feeding hopper avoiding the axial offset. The side walls of the feeding hopper may be<br>
arranged also to extend upwardly even up to the inner surface of the sieve grate due to the<br>
fact that the detaching device is positioned outside the sieve grate.<br>
The mesh fabric may be especially a square meshes fabric having a mesh aperture between<br>
0,2 and 1,2 mm. Such square mesh fabrics may be manufactured economically on looms.<br>
The mesh aperture may be held constant in narrow regions and allows an individual<br>
adaptation with respect to the size of the particles of the sludge-like screenings.<br>
Consequently, screenings in form of fibres, hairs and the like can be removed without<br>
difficulty.<br><br>
The feeding hopper perforated on its bottom may have bores with a diameter of about 2 mm.<br>
Surprisingly, bores of this size do not hinder to screen sludge-like material. The screenings<br>
deposited with the fine mesh fabric will agglomerate during detaching and enters the feeding<br>
hopper. Bores of this size are very effective to reach an improved pre-dewatering in the<br>
feeding hopper.<br>
The number of the guide plate forming the troughs over the separation surface may be<br>
chosen and is not critical. An adaptation with respect to the consistence of the sludge is<br>
individually possible. In many cases it is sufficient to arrange three guide plates over the<br>
separation surface. The guide plates have to be arranged with equal distance to each other.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a part of a channel 1, in which a liquid 2 contaminated with material to be<br>
screened and having a water level 3 is flowing in the direction of arrow 4. The device is<br>
located in the channel with its axis 5 being arranged in a inclined manner, the angle of<br>
inclination preferably having 35°. The device includes a cylindrical sieve grate 6, the main<br>
part of which is a mesh fabric 7. The sieve grate 6 has an open front side 8 on the inflow side<br>
thereof, the contaminated liquid flowing through the open front side into the interior of the<br>
sieve grate 6. A sealed and thus hydraulically closed back side 9 is provided downstream.<br>
The sieve grate 6 is rotatably arranged near the back side 9 and sealed with respect to<br>
elements not rotating. The sieve grate 6 is rotatably driven around its axis 5. The drive is<br>
designed to be especially discontinuous, meaning that time periods of rotation and time<br>
periods of standstill are following each other. A motor 11 serves for the drive 10 possibly<br>
including a gear 12.<br>
The sieve grate 6 besides the mesh fabric 7 includes a shaping carrier element 13. The<br>
mesh fabric 7 is located on the inner surface of the carrier element 13. It is the function of the<br>
carrier element 13 to permanently guarantee the cylindrical shape of the sieve grate 6 and to<br>
take forces. The inner cylindrical surface of the mesh fabric 7 forms a separation surface 14.<br>
The separation surface 14 is completed by guide plates 15 being located possibly in parallel<br>
with respect to the axis 5 of the device or to a surface line of the cylindrical sieve grate 6<br>
respectively. The guide plates 15 are in sealing contact to the separation surface 14 and are<br>
separated by separation walls 39 and at least closed at one end by an end wall 40. The<br>
troughs designed in this manner rotate with the sieve grate 6 and thus form trough-like<br>
chambers moving from below the water level 3 to upwardly out of the water level 3 while<br>
rotating and conveying the material to be screened.<br>
A detaching device 16 is provided above the water level 3 and above the sieve grate 6, the<br>
detaching device including a spray rail 17 having nozzles 18. Water is sprayed with the<br>
detaching device 16 from outside through the openings of the carrier element 13 and the<br>
openings in the mesh fabric 7 so that the material to be deposited on the inner surface of the<br>
mesh fabric is detached and reaches a feeding hopper 19 under the influence of gravitational<br>
force and/or the forces of the sprayed water. The feeding hopper 19 is arranged in fixed<br>
manner and in parallel to the axis 5 of the device and preferably concentrically with respect<br>
to the sieve grate 6. The detaching device may be designed to operate with spray water<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
and/or pressurized air. The feeding hopper 19 comprises a hopper wall 20 upwardly<br>
extending and side walls 21, both being arranged with respect to the open front side 8 of the<br>
sieve grate 6. The feeding hopper 19 includes openings 22 on the bottom side, possibly<br>
having a diameter of up to 2 mm.<br>
A screw conveyor 23 is located coaxially to the axis 5 of the entire device and thus to the<br>
sieve grate 6 also, the screw conveyor 23 including a housing 24 and a conveying screw 25<br>
positioned therein. A shaft 26 running through and carrying the conveying screw 25 extends<br>
from the motor 11 and the gear respectively through the whole housing 24 and projects in<br>
axial direction with respect to the housing 24. The conveying screw 25 cooperates with the<br>
feeding hopper 19 in this region. Here, the conveying screw 25 may be provided with<br>
brushes not shown for clarity reason, the brushes stroking the pieced bottom wall of the<br>
feeding hopper 19 and thus cleaning and uncovering the openings 22 again and again.<br>
The motor 11 drives the conveying screw 25 of the screwing conveyor 23 via the shaft 26.<br>
The motor 11 serves to rotate the sieve grate 6 also. A drive arm 27 may be provided fort his<br>
function, the drive arm being in fixed connection with the shaft 26 and the sieve grate 6 also,<br>
especially with its carrier element 13. The area between the sieve grate 6 and the walls of<br>
the channel 1 is sealingly closed by a planking sheet metal 28, so that the contaminated<br>
liquid is forced to enter the interior of the cylindrical sieve grate 6 via the open front side 8.<br>
The liquid flows through openings in the mesh fabric 7 and remains in the channel while the<br>
material to be deposited is deposited on the inner surface of the mesh fabric 7 and is<br>
conveyed upwardly by the sieve grate during rotation. The material after releasing by the<br>
detaching device 16 enters the feeding hopper 19 and thus reaches the screwing conveyor<br>
23. It is upwardly conveyed and reaches a discharge point 29 for example in a container 30.<br>
A pressing zone 31 may be arranged in the upper region of the screwing conveyor 23 further<br>
dewatering the material to be deposited and conveyed prior to reaching the discharge point.<br>
A conduit 32 leads the liquid of the pressing zone 31 back into the channel 1.<br>
Fig. 2 in enlarged scale indicates again the design of the sieve grate 6. The inner<br>
circumference of the sieve grate 6 carrying the mesh fabric 7 forming the separation surface<br>
14 is shown. It may be recognized also that the guide plates 15 extend in parallel to the axis<br>
and are arranged in inclined manner with respect to the separation surface 14 of the mesh<br>
fabric 7. The guide plates 15 on its free side not facing the separation surface 14 comprise<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
openings 33, the openings here being designed in a comb-like manner. The openings 33<br>
may have the form of bores also being provided in this region of the guide plates 15.<br>
Consequently, a permanent dewatering occurs during the upwardly directed conveying<br>
motion of the material to be screened in the through-like chambers. The levels of the liquids<br>
in the chambers vary and liquid passes the comb-like openings 33 or the bores and flows<br>
back to the channel.<br>
Fig. 3 once again indicates the design according line III-III of Fig. 2. The feeding hopper 19 is<br>
easily to be seen. The feeding hopper includes a side wall 21 which may have openings 41<br>
arranged in the lower region being arranged in addition to the openings 22 of the bottom of<br>
the feeding hopper 19. The openings 41 usefully may have a larger diameter than the<br>
openings 22 arranged in the region of the bottom. The arrangement of three guiding plates<br>
15 is to be seen, the guiding plates being produced as straight elements and being arranged<br>
in parallel with respect to the axis 5 of the device.<br>
Fig. 4 in enlarged scale indicates on the one hand the mesh fabric 7 and the carrier element<br>
13 here having the function of a supporting fabric 34. The supporting fabric 34 ensures the<br>
shape and is designed to be relatively rigid so that it remains its shape and provides the<br>
stability of the sieve grate 6 when cylindrically bent. The mesh fabric 37 is a square meshes<br>
fabric 35 having a mesh aperture 36 between 0,2 and 1,2 mm depending on the application.<br>
The interior of the square mesh fabric 35 fulfils the function of the separating surface 14.<br>
A further embodiment of the sieve grate 6 is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A basket 37 having<br>
arms gives the function of the shaping carrier element 13, the struts 38 of which are arranged<br>
in relation parallel to the axis and shown in highlighting. It is evident that the struts 38 are<br>
held with circular extending supporting elements not shown. Here also, the inner<br>
circumference of the basket 37 or the carrier element 13 is coated with the mesh fabric 7.<br>
Here also the region of the bottom of the feeding hopper 19 may be designed as a perforated<br>
plate having the openings 22. In addition, the openings 41 shown in Fig. 3 may be arranged<br>
in the hopper wall 20.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment of the device, being similar to the embodiment of Fig. 2 in<br>
a number of details. The guide plates 15 are designed to be bent elements arranged in<br>
inclined manner with respect to the horizontal direction and thus not in parallel to the interior<br>
circumference of the sieve grate 6 in sealed relation. Bores 42 may be arranged near the rim<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
instead of a comb-like shape of the guide plates 15. It is evident that a number of guide<br>
plates 15 may be arranged evenly distributed about the circumference. Only one guide plate<br>
15 is shown for clarity. The level of the liquid of each single trough-like chamber will vary<br>
during rotation of the sieve grate 6 and permanently change. Dewatering takes place in this<br>
manner and liquid permanently flows back to the channel.<br>
One or more additional spray rails 43 are shown in Fig. 7, the spray rails being positioned<br>
below the perforated plate having the openings 22. These spray rails 43 include nozzles 44<br>
also and may be operated with spraying water and/or pressurized air. The spray rails 43 may<br>
be used in addition or alternatively to the brushes being positioned on the inside of the rim of<br>
the conveying screw in the region of the feeding hopper 19. The spray rails 43 serve or<br>
increase respectively the cleaning of the openings 22 of the perforated plate of the feeding<br>
hopper 19. Preferably, the spray rails and the entire device may be operated discontinuously,<br>
however in those time periods in which the water level 3 in the channel 1 has fallen below a<br>
lower level as shown after cleaning of the sieve grate 6.<br>
The details shown in the drawings may be combined with each other in useful manner within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
