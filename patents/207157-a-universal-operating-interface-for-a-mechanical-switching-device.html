COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>

1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A UNIVERSAL OPERATING INTERFACE FOR A MECHANICAL SWITCHING DEVICE<br>
2. (a) LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO LIMITED, (b) L &amp; T House, Ballard Estate, Mumbai 400 001, State of Maharashtra, India, (c) an Indian company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to universal operation interface for a mechanical switching devices usually provided to close and open one or more electrical circuits by separable contacts and in particular to a handle coupler assembly adapted for use with such mechanical switching devices to ON and OFF such switching devices by clockwise rotary and anti-clockwise reverse motion respectively. Mechanical switching devices wherein the handle coupler assembly of the invention can be used include fuse-combination unit, disconnector and switch units/assemblies, switch-disconnecting circuit breakers and the like.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Switching devices and their combinations with associated operative control, measuring, protective and regulating equipments are conventionally known as switch gear. In particular, switch gears usually make or break the current in one or more electric circuits by various methods including use of mechanical switching means which include separable contacts. Such mechanical switches can be the usual ON-OFF switches which can be operated by vertical up/down motion or sideway movement between on and OFF position or a rotary motion operable switch involving a rotatable knob or handle, Importantly, in case of electrical switching units the switching units apart from favouring the putting on and off the circuitry is also required to ensure necessary degree of safety to facilitate the operation and maintenance of the unit. In order to ensure such safety consideration switching devices / units are usually installed within water and electrical contact proof assemblies with connecting operative means by which it can be actuated from outside. Such actuation is usually achieved by handle coupler assemblies mounted on the doors of such assemblies. Such a handle coupler assembly can be a handle wheel or a knob for actuation from outside.<br>
Usually, a rotatable operating shaft and pin actuates such switching device, which is housed inside and is operatively linked to a handle coupler assembly to enable actuation of such operating shaft and pin from outside of the assembly. It is also possible to have a basic vertically up/down or sideways ON-OFF operable<br><br>
switch adapted for operation by a rotatable handle wheel or knob from outside of the assembly.<br>
It is important to note that keeping in view the safety requirements of such switching devices/units even the handle coupler assemblies used to operate such devices/units from outside of the housing/assembly are required to meet certain standard mandatory norms.   Such standard requirements include -<br>
a)	The handle coupler assembly should necessarily provide for a clockwise rotation for increase of the physical quantity like current, voltage, power, frequency etc. Therefore, for switching the device ON the handle essentially should be rotated in a clockwise direction while for turning it off the same need to be rotated anticlockwise.<br>
b)	As and when switching devices are mounted in an assembly all live parts which can be unintentionally touched after the door is opened, as a preventive measure should be disconnected before the door is opened. This is provided by interlocking the door or doors with these switching devices so that the same can be opened when the disconnector is off and it shall not be possible to close / ON the device while the door is open except by overriding the interlock or using a tool.<br>
There are varieties of operating systems for such switching devices presently available to attain both the operation of the switching unit such as a circuit breaker from outside of its housing and also the desired interlocking of the door in ON state of the operating system.<br>
US 4,034,169 discloses a control center handle mechanism for a metal cabinet having a circuit interrupter electrically connected to the bus bars. The system provides an operator for actuating the interrupter between open and closed positions, an access door to the compartment on the cabinet, a handle pivotally mounted within the cabinet and operatively connected to the operator, the handle extending through the access door, means for operatively connecting the handle<br><br>
to the operator including link means extending between the handle and the operator, and interlock means between the handle and an access door.<br>
US 4,074,091 provides an operating mechanism for an enclosed circuit breaker, a latch pivotally mounted to the frame and cooperating with the handle .A catch on the door is adapted to perform interlocking functions whereby the door cannot be opened unless the handle is in an "OFF" position and whereby the handle cannot be moved to an "ON" position unless the door is closed. A defeater is provided for manually pivoting the latch to defeat its interlocking functions.<br>
US 6,131,423 discloses another safety door-locking system for a switchgear cabinet, basically comprising a rotatably mounted control disc permanently connected to the switch in the switchgear cabinet the control disc additionally representing the position of the switch. The control disc and a locking rod are operationally connected mechanically via a connecting rod and a connecting angle held between guide pins in the locking rod and the locking rod is mounted displaceably for the purpose of locking the locking linkage of the cabinet door.<br>
Importantly for safety considerations conventional operating system for switching device such as circuit breakers provision for padlocking in OFF condition to prevent unauthorised operation of the operating system is provided. This limits the chances of any unauthorized person from putting ON the device from its OFF state whether intentionally or unintentionally. However, such a system leaves the housing door open for possible unauthorized access even though the operating unit which is padlocked. Therefore, any unauthorized person can still open the door of the cabinet housing the switching means by unscrewing the reieasable screws on the door and operate the unit by some tool . There is thus the need for also ensuring that even during the OFF condition not only the switching means (handle) is padlocked but also the door is interlocked with the padlocking of the handle. This would provide added safety to the user and enable preventing any form of unauthorized access into the assembly even during OFF condition.<br>
US 4,612,424 discloses 3 door mounted circuit breaker operating mechanism which on one hand provides for an interlocking plate in the operating mechanism<br><br><br>
which interacts with a driver shaft in the 'ON' state which prevents opening of the door when the drive shaft is in a position corresponding to an 'ON' conditions of the circuit breaker and on the otherhand also takes care of ensuring that even in the OFF state of the circuit breaker the operating system can be padlocked maintaining door interlock as well as preventing access to the defeat mechanism for total safety in OFF condition. In particular, the system is adapted such that interlock plate interacts therebetween the driving shaft in an extended OFF state of the handle such that it arrests the door opening and at the same time blocks access to the defeat mechanism to thereby provide interlocking even in OFF state of the unit as an added safety.<br>
The above reveal the need for various standard features in terms of its operation, use and safety in the operative mechanism of switching device/units such as desired clockwise operation to put ON the unit and anticlock wise operation for the OFF state, interlock in the ON state with desired defeat mechanism and also the padlocking of the operative unit in OFF condition with or without door interlock. However, it would be apparent from the above state of art that more the desired operational and safety features in the operative mechanism the more complex and cost-extensive becomes the operating mechanism.<br>
Apart from the above safety requirements for such switch devices/switchgear assemblies and their handle coupler assembly, another important aspect which regulates the manufacture and installation of such switching devices/units within the assemblies is the power line-load direction. Depending upon the circuitry to which such unit is required to be connected, the mounting of the switching device/unit is also determined so as to achieve smaller link/cable work to reduce the distribution loss, internal stress as well as cost. In particular, based on such line (L) and load (LD) direction a switching device installation can be in any of the four orientations as indicated in accompanying figure 1(a) to 1(d). Also, as apparent from the said figure 1, depending upon the mounting of the switching unit based on the line (L) and load (LD) direction in the assembly, the disposition of the operative switch which is usually a rotatable shaft (S) with pin (P) also changes. To operatively connect the operative shaft and pin to a handle coupler<br><br><br><br>
assembly to operate the unit from outside of the assembly such handle coupler assemblies are usually provided with a slot into which the operating shaft pin (P) interacts to rotate the operative shaft to ON-OFF the switching unit. It is important that the handle coupler assembly and its slot should match the disposition of the pin (P) i.e. vertical [ as in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(d)] or horizontal [as in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c)] to effectively connect to the handle coupler. Therefore, the handle coupler for the vertical disposed pin (P) mounted switching device (Type A) should have a corresponding vertical slot while the horizontal disposed pin (P) mounted switching device (Type B) should have a corresponding horizontal slot.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 2 to illustrate how the position of the switch handle (HD) which is external of the housing (HO) accommodating the switching unit changes when the unit is ON and in OFF condition. Since, always a clockwise rotary motion of the handle is required to ON the unit from the OFF state, due to such change in the disposition in the handle relative to the disposition of the switching unit in particular the operating shaft pin (P) inside the assembly, the OFF-ON position in respect of different orientation of the switching unit is apparent. While in the instance only a single switching device is provided in a housing it may not be that problematic, in situations where two or more switching unit adjacent one another with different mounting orientations are provided, it is possible that the corresponding handles which are external of the housing which also assume correspondingly changed disposition can be disposed relative to one another which could confuse the operator whether or not the switching unit is in OFF or ON. Fig. 3 shows how for different mounting of the adjacent switching devices can make it difficult for the operator/user of the unit to readily appreciate from outside the state of the respective switching units housed inside.<br><br>
The existing problem is explained in greater detail hereunder in relation to accompany Figures 4 and Figure 5(a) to 5(c). As shown in Fig. 4 a conventional switching device (SD) is housed in the housing (HO) having a door (D). The operating shaft (S) of the unit has a pin (P) which usually interacts with the handle coupler assembly (HA) to occasionally change over to ON and OFF<br><br><br>
condition by rotary motion of the handle (H) of the handle coupler assembly (HA) from external of the housing (HO).<br>
A pair of releasable screwing means (SM) provide for releasable closing of the housing door (D) with respect to the housing.<br>
Reference is now invited to figures 5(a) to 5(c), which illustrate a known variety of handle coupler assembly (HA) which basically comprises of a base plate (BP) which is secured to the housing door (D of Fig. 4). The handle (HD) is fixed with the coupler (CP) and adapted such that on rotary motion of the handle (HD), the coupler (CP) also rotates and the later which is operatively connected to the operating shaft pin (P, Refer Fig. 4) of the switching device puts ON the switching unit from outside by such rotary motion of the handle (HD). Importantly, however, the coupler (CP) of such conventional handle/assembly has only a pair of slots (SL) facing one another cut out in the cylindrical hollow coupler (CP) peripheral wall and, because the coupler is fixed to the handle, it is only possible to have a handle with either a vertically disposed pair of slots (SL) of the couple or a horizontally disposed pair of slots (SL) of the couple to match the Type A on Type B mounting disposition of the shaft pin of the switching unit operative connection. Thus, if you have a switch device mounted such that the operating shaft pin assumes a vertical disposition (say Type A mounting), the conventional handle with the coupler should be selected to have a coupler vertical slot (SL) to operatively connect to the pin to operate the unit. Likewise, if you have a handle coupler of the above conventional type having a horizontally disposed pair of slots (SL) the same can be used only with a switching device which has the operating shaft pin also horizontally disposed after its installation (say the Type B namely). Therefore, conventional handle coupling assembly has limitations of use dependent upon the selected quadrant of operation of the switching device and you cannot use the same handle for both the vertical and horizontal disposed operating shaft pin disposition of the switching device.<br>
It is therefore clearly evident that there is a clear limitation/restriction based on the manner of mounting/installation of the switching device in an assembly and the corresponding handle means that need to be provided and the consumer has to be sure that the mounting/installation will be of a particular nature so that the<br><br>
device purchased is effectively used maintaining standard norms and safety aspects. In case, subsequent to the purchase the disposition of the switching unit need to be changed, in such cases and/or in situations where a switching unit is reinstalled in a new location which requires it reoriented mounting it is difficult to change such installation/orientation since that necessarily affected the position of the operating shaft pin and also its coupling handling assembly and possibly required for a fresh purchase of devices and coupling handling assembly of desired orientation/disposition. The aforesaid go to show the need existing in the art to provide for switching devices/units which can be mounted in any manner whatsoever depending upon the consumer's need/requirements and also facilitate change over from one set of disposition of the switching device to another without requiring change of the switching device or the handle and yet maintain the desired disposition of the operative handle in OFF and ON conditions to avoid any confusion as to the state of the switching unit during operation/use.<br>
While the need in the art for such switching units which could be disposed in any orientation and universal handle which can be used to couple switching units of various quadrants of operations has been there it had been extremely difficult to develop such universal handle means which would be simple to obtain and could provide for such varied disposition and couple with any type of switch mounting. This is because apart from providing the universality in the handle mechanism such switching devices/units are further required to meet the specific standards to ensure effective and safe operation which include a) clockwise motion for switching ON and anticlockwise motion for restoring to OFF condition b) interlocking of the door in ON condition of the handle c) means for defeat of interlock in ON condition and d) autorestorable interlock defeat.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device such as a handle coupling system discussed above which would be adapted to operate any mechanical switching device/unit external of the housing accommodating such switching device/unit maintaining standard norms of rotary ON-OFF of such switching<br><br><br>
devices/unit irrespective of the mounting /disposition with respect to the power line and load.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device and the like which can serve as a universal rotary handle external of the housing for such switchgear unit and can be used for any quadrant of mounting of the switchgear and its operating shaft pin disposition maintaining desired standard/user friendly ON-OFF disposition.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device for use with any rotary operable switching device/unit installed in housing/assemblies having simple and cost-effective means for providing the desired padlocking of the handle in OFF condition with or without interlocking of the housing door as an added safety feature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for mechanical switching devices/assemblies such as fuse-combination units, disconnector, switch-disconnectors, circuit breaker etc. having a universal operating interface for such device that can operate by rotary motion as per standard norms external of the housing and can be coupled to the operating shaft pin/means of the device/unit in any quadrant of mounting of the device/unit and/or would provide for the desired padlocking of the handle in OFF state with or without door interlock..<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device for use with any rotary operable switching device/unit installed in housing/assemblies having simple and cost-effective means for providing the desired padlocking of the handle in OFF condition with or without interlocking of the housing door as an added safety feature.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device for use with any mechanical switching<br><br><br><br>
levice which would on one hand provide for coupling of the handle external of he housing to such fuse/switch unit mounted in any quadrant of operation inside he housing and at the same time provide for possible interlocking of the panel door in the off condition taking care of the other prerequisites of such units such as interlocking with the housing in ON condition, defeat mechanism , auto estorable interlock defeat and padlocking in OFF condition.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device for use with any rotatably operable switch/fuse unit which can be adapted for application on any variety of switch/fuse units irrespective of the quadrant of mounting without requiring the replacement of the switch/fuse unit and/or the handle thereby ensuring wide and extended application of such switch/fuse units in various fields and systems.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device adapted to operatively connect the handle to the operating means of the switching unit which would be obtained of simple components/gadgets avoiding too many components and/or complexity of operations and yet meet standard operation and safety requirements.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device for switching devices having features which would make the conversion of the handle assembly for its operative connection to a vertically disposed operating shaft pin (P) of the Type A and a horizontally disposed operating shaft of the Type B by simple rotary adjustment of components without replacement of the device or affecting its mounting.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device and the like to operate the unit external of said housing comprising :<br>
a base member adapted to be fixed with respect to the door of said housing having an opening for operative connection of a handle means external of said<br><br><br>
nousing and the operative shaft pin of said switching device/unit inside of said housing ;<br>
a coupler means with its one end adapted to be operatively connected to said handle means and its other end adapted to operatively connect to the said pin of said operating shaft at any orthogonal disposition such that on rotary motion of the handle means from an OFF position clockwise to an ON position and vise-versa the operative shaft with pin is rotated through said coupler to put ON and OFF the switching device;<br>
a rotatable interlock bracket means provided with respect to said coupler and adapted for selective orthogonal disposition of the pin with respect to the coupler and maintained resiliency biased such that when the handle is in OFF state the operating shaft pin interaction with the coupler and the interlock bracket is so disposed such as to facilitate release of the operating shaft pin from the coupler and interlock bracket to favour opening of the housing door and when the handle is clockwise rotated to the ON state the same rotates the coupler with the operating shaft pin such that the shaft pin gets interlocked therebetween the coupler and the interlock bracket to in effect interlock the door with the operating shaft pin;<br>
a defeat lever means adapted to release said interlocked shaft pin by retracting said interlock bracket against its resilient spring bias with the handle in ON state to thereby provide for release of the door interlock in ON state and means for autorestoration of the door interlock with respect to said operating shaft pin in the ON condition;<br>
means for padlocking of the handle with respect to the base member in the OFF condition.<br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect   an universal operating interface for a<br>
mechanical switching device and the like comprise :<br>
a cup shaped E-plate adapted to be fixed with respect to the door of said housing<br>
having a central opening for operative connection to a handle means external of<br>
said housing and the operative shaft pin of said switching device/unit inside of<br>
said housing ;<br>
a cylindrical  shaped  coupler with  its one end  adapted to  be     operatively<br>
connected to  said  handle means and  its other end  adapted for universal<br><br><br>
mounting with respect to an operating shaft pin disposition comprising vertically and horizontally disposed slots to operatively connect to the said pin of said operating shaft at any orthogonal disposition such that on rotary motion of the handle means from an OFF position clockwise to an ON position and vise-versa the operative shaft with pin is rotated through said coupler to put ON and OFF the switching device;<br>
an interlock bracket means comprising a circular disc with a central opening , a pair of axially protruding catch members provided with respect to said central passage disposed such that in assembly the coupler is positioned within said catch members , means to selectively position the interlock bracket with respect to said coupler based on the selected pin mounting and its interaction with the vertical or horizontal slots of the coupler and adapted to be resiliency biased such that when the handle is in OFF state the operating shaft pin interaction with the coupler and the interlock bracket with its catch members is such as to facilitate release of the operating shaft pin from the coupler and interlock bracket to favour opening of the housing door and when the handle is clockwise rotated to the ON state the same rotates the coupler with the operating shaft pin such that the shaft pin get interlocked therebetween the coupler and the interlock bracket catch members to in effect interlock the door with the operating shaft pin; a defeat lever means adapted to release said interlocked shaft pin by retracting said interlock bracket against its resilient spring bias with the handle in ON state to thereby provide for release of the door interlock in ON state and means for autorestoration of the door interlock with respect to said operating shaft pin in the ON condition ; means for padlocking of the handle in OFF state with said E-plate/base plate.<br>
Importantly, in keeping with the standard requirements, the universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device of the invention discussed above also provides for a desired defeat mechanism for opening of the interlock even in the ON condition of the handle. For the purpose the interlock bracket is usually maintained resiliency biased by spring mechanism to its position where the rotary motion of the handle from the OFF to ON condition would effect the interlocking of the door. To effectuate the defeat a lever means is provided to retract the interlock bracket against its spring bias to a position to release the obstruction<br><br>
created by the bracket /catch members to the said operating shaft pin in the slot of the coupler such that by maintaining such a condition the door can be opened even in the ON state. As soon as the defeat purpose is completed, for the purpose of autorestoration of interlock the interlock bracket and in particular the catch member is adapted to take care of the required autorestoration of the defeat/interlock by way of providing for a slopped angular disposition at the front face thereof which interacts with the drive shaft pin for such purpose. Thus when the door after the defeat operation is pressed the angular /sloped front face of the catch members come in contact with the pin of the operating shaft which due to the sloped disposition slid through the angular face and finally gets into the slots with the interlock bracket catch members again blocking the slot opening to restore the interlocking in ON state.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device to adapt the handle for any orthogonal mounting of the switching device/unit and yet achieve the desired purpose of providing clockwise rotary motion to put on the switching device, means for interlock in ON state, defeat mechanism for opening the door in ON state and autorestorable interlock. Added to the above the system also provides for padlocking of the handle in the off condition and for the purpose the handle is provided with means which in the off state would operatively be padlocked with a corresponding portion of the E-plate which is permanently secured to the door. Thus once the handle and the E-plate are padlocked together the handle can not be moved from the OFF condition. This therefore takes care of the further requirement of the padlocking of the handle in the OFF condition.<br>
In accordance with the another aspect of the present invention there is provided a handle assembly with provision for pad locking in OFF state with or without door interlock comprising :<br>
a base member adapted to be fixed with respect to the door of said housing having an opening for operative connection to a handle means external of said housing and the operative shaft pin of said switching device/unit inside of said housing ;<br><br>
a coupler means with its one end adapted to be operatively connected to said handle means and its other end adapted to operatively connect to the said pin of said operating shaft such that on rotary motion of the handle means from an OFF position clockwise to an ON position and vise-versa the operative shaft with pin is rotated through said coupler to put ON and OFF the switching device; an interlock bracket means provided with respect to said coupler and adapted to be resiliency biased such that when the handle is in OFF state the operating shaft pin interaction with the coupler and the interlock bracket is such as to facilitate release of the operating shaft pin from the coupler and interlock bracket to favour opening of the housing door and when the handle is clockwise rotated to the ON state the same rotates the coupler with the operating shaft pin such that the shaft pin get interlocked between the coupler and the interlock bracket to in effect interlock the door with the operating shaft pin;<br>
a defeat lever means adapted to release said interlocked shaft pin by retracting said interlock bracket against its resilient spring bias with the handle in ON state to thereby provide for release of the door interlock in ON state coupler and means for autorestoration of the door interlock with respect to said operating shaft pin in the ON condition ;<br>
means for padlocking of the handle in OFF state with or without door interlock comprising means to padlock said handle with said base plate in OFF condition with the interlock bracket adapted to be displaced against its resistant biased state to cause interlocking of the shaft pin with respect to said slots in the coupler and the catch member of the interlock bracket to cause said interlock in OFF state.<br>
Importantly, in the above discussed universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device assembly the provision of padlocking of handle in OFF with or without door interlock is achieved by way of a defeat lever operatively connected to the resilient biased usual OFF state position of the interlock bracket. To attend such door interlock in OFF state the lever is displaced against its resilient spring bias to thereby in the process rotate the interlock bracket and bring it in position to interlock the shaft pin with respect to the coupler slot and the catch members of the interlock bracket thereby causing door interlock, means to padlock the handle in OFF state with said base/E-plate<br><br>
with the interlock bracket in its displaced state ahead of the padlock and preventing its retraction until padlock is opened.<br>
As would be apparent, in the OFF state of the switching unit, the interlock bracket is usually in a position where the operating shaft pin has a free access into the slot and is not obstructed by the interlock bracket. Therefore, even without the movement of the handle one can still open the panel door by unscrewing the screw means (SM) as shown in Fig. 4. However, as explained above by way of the rotatable interlock bracket means and the defeat lever means in the universal operating interface for a mechanical switching device of the invention it would be possible to even achieve interlocking of the door in the OFF condition of the handle. In particular, for such interlock in OFF condition the defeat lever is rotatably displaced to a position ahead of the padlocking position of the handle with respect to the base member/E-plate against its usual biased state wherein the catch members are disposed with respect to the coupler slot in OFF state to prevent passage of the shaft pin through the slots for opening of the door in OFF state. In the process the catch members assume a position where it interrupts the free passage of the pin through the slots to cause interlock of the door with the shaft pin. A leg portion of the lever is adapted to protrude such as to get obstructed by the padlocked handle in such a state to maintain the interlock of the door so long as the handle is locked in the OFF state. This therefore provides for the added flexibility of the padlocking of the handle with or without door interlock.<br>

Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 6 which is an exploded view of the universal handle coupler assembly in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in the said figure the assembly basically comprises of a handle (2) which is having at its face towards the panel door a connective means which co-operates and interacts with the rear end (13) of the coupler (4). In particular, the door of the housing is provided with a passage with respect to which a cup shaped E-plate (3) is secured which internally accommodates the said coupler (4), the interlock bracket (6) and its resilient spring (8) and also rotatably supports the defeat lever(5) of the handle assembly in combination with the shroud (7).<br>
The coupler (4) is internally accommodated with respect to said E-plate (3) through a central passage (9) such that the rear end (13) of the coupler connects into the corresponding handle groove (17). On rotary motion of the handle (2) the coupler (4) is also rotated. As illustrated in the said figure, to favour the universal application of the handle and in particular connect the coupler to any orientation of the operating shaft pin of the switching device, the coupler basically comprises a hollow cylindrical body having a pair of slots (11 and 12) which are adapted to accommodate the pin of the shaft in either horizontal or vertical disposition respectively and such that on rotary motion of the handle the coupler (4) rotates<br><br><br>
and thereby the same further rotates the pin and shaft of the switching device to finally put ON and OFF the switching unit.<br>
To facilitate the required usual interlock in ON state of the door with respect to the operating pin in either of the slots 11 or 12 i.e. the horizontal or vertical dispositions of the operating shaft pin, the interlock bracket is obtained in the form of atleast partially rotatable disc (6) having the axially extruding catch members (14, 15). To adapt the disposition of the interlock with respect to the coupler such that in any selective interconnection of the coupler to the shaft pin i.e. Type A or Type B, the interlock position based on the resiliently/spring biased usual state always assume a position wherein it can lock the shaft pin in the coupler slot in the ON position of the handle, the interlock is provided with the spaced apart (about 90°) rotatably shifted disposition with respect to the coupler such that in either of the two vertical or horizontal disposition of the pin in the coupler slot, the interlock bracket and in particular the catch member assumes a position where in the ON state of the handle the operating shaft pin is locked in the coupler slot to interlock the door. This adapts the interlock alongwith the coupler for universal mounting facility in accordance with the interface of the invention. In assembly, therefore, the coupler passes through the central passage of the interlock bracket and the catch members surround the coupler The catch member are spaced and adapted such that in respect of each of the two disposition of the shaft pin in the coupler slots i.e. the vertical or horizontal, the interlock is can be achieved in the ON state. This provides for universality of the handle to adapt to any pin mounting disposition of the switching device. Additionally, the spring (8) bias of the interlock bracket is maintained such that in either of its dispositions for vertical/horizontal pin disposition in the coupler , it usually assumes a position such that when the handle is rotated form OFF to ON state, the coupler slots and the position of the catch members in the interlock bracket together interlock the shaft pin to thereby achieve the interlock of the door in the ON state.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect, the universal operating interface of the invention takes care of the required defeat mechanism for opening of the door in ON state of the handle.    For the purpose, the interlock bracket is normally<br><br>
maintained spring biased to the usual position to achieve interlock of door in ON state of the handle. To effect the defeat in ON state the spring biased interlock bracket is connected to a defeat lever (5). Now as and when the interlock is required to be released in ON state, the defeat lever(5) is used to rotate the interlock bracket against its spring biased interlocked state to a position where the catch member assume a position to release the free path of the shaft pin through the coupler slot to favour opening of the door. Further to achieve autorestoration of the defeat lever the catch members (14, 15) at the front face end is provided with sloped angular disposition (141, 151) such that when the door is again pressed against the operating shaft pin the latter presses against the sloped/angular face (141, 151) of the catch member (14, 15) to slid thereon and finally get interlocked in the slot with respect to the catch member due to the spring biased motion of the interlock bracket to such usual locked state.<br>
The coupler, interlock bracket, spring for defeat lever are all housed within the E-plate (3) and the shroud (7) to define a compact housing with the lever (5) adapted to be slidably rotate and operable from external of the housing. The lever (5) which is secured to the interlock bracket (6) by means of screw (66) is also maintained spring biased to the locking state of the bracket and for operating the defeat it is allowed to be partially rotated with respect to a ridge path (31) of the E-plate (3) to thereby rotate the bracket against its spring bias. However, as soon as the autorestoration is achieved the lever and the bracket assume their usual biased position for interlock.<br>
The provision of universal operating interface for any disposition of the operating shaft pin (16) based on the desired orthogonal mounting is illustrated further in relation to figures 7(a) and 7(b).<br>
As represented in said figure 7a in case of any type A, the operating shaft of the switch is disposed such that its pin (16) assumes a horizontal disposition. In such case, the corresponding horizontal slotted region (11) of the coupler (4) is adapted to cooperate with the operating shaft pin (16). On the otherhand, in the case of any type B mounting as illustrated in Figure 7b the operating shaft assumes  a   position   such   that  its   pin   is  substantially  vertically  disposed.<br><br>
Importantly, the present invention avoids limitation of universality in the coupler to adopt to such changed orientation of the shaft pin, and for the purpose the same is also provided with a vertical slots (12).<br>
Apart from providing the above universality in adapting the handle for both Type A and Type B installation of the device the universal handle further meets the desired standard requirement of interlocking of the door in the ON condition. The manner of achieving such interlocking in ON condition is now explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to accompanying figure 8.<br>
As would be apparent from Figure 8, the coupler (4) which is operatively linked to the handle (2) rotates clockwise while handle is being shifted from the OFF position to ON position. During this shift of the handle (2) and the operative connection of coupler (4) the pin of the operating shaft is also rotated to the position therebetween the protruding portions of the catch members (14, 15) of the interlock bracket. In such situation, the shaft pin is obstructed by the protruding portions of the catch member (14, 15) interlocking bracket such that it is not possible to takeout the handle coupling assembly with respect to shaft pin thereby interlocking the panel door on which the handle is mounted with respect to the operating shaft of the switching device. This arrangement adequately takes care of the desired interlocking of the door in the ON condition of the switch. Needless to add as explained above the resilient spring bias of the interlock bracket maintains the catch member in such locked coupler in the usual state.<br>
The universal operating interface of the invention further takes care of the other standard requirements to provide a defeat mechanism so as to release the interlock even in the ON position. For the purpose, the defeat lever (5) and in particular the interlock bracket (6) is maintained resiliency biased by spring means (8) to a position as indicated by Figure 9a, while the handle is in the ON condition. To effect the defeat mechanism the defeat lever (5) is atleast partially rotated by about say 90 degrees in the direction of the arrow (A) in Figure 9a to finally assume a position which is illustrated by Figure 9b. During this manual shift of the lever the spring (8) is compressed and the movement of the lever is<br><br><br>
also adapted to rotate the interlock bracket by about 90 degrees to release the pin from its interlocking portions of the catch member and clear the passage of the pin of the operating shaft and in the process enable the release of the door interlock from its operative connection with the shaft of the switching device.<br>
As is the additional requirement that along with such provision for defeat, the system should also facilitate automatic restoration of the defeat mechanism and interlock in the same ON condition of the switch handle. This is achieved by way of the angular front/sloped region (141, 151) of the catch member (14, 15) on the interlock bracket. Due to such sloped and angular disposition of the front face of the catch member of the interlock bracket, the pin slides through the sloped region on the application of door closing force through the handle and finally it slides into the interlock position of the catch member. Importantly, since during application of the pressure on the handle and encountering the slopped region the interlock bracket rotates against the natural bias of the spring as soon as the pin gets interlocked the spring action retracts the interlock bracket to its original spring biased position to thereby retain its interlocked state with the handle in ON position. This, therefore, takes care of the further additional requirement of auto restoration of interlock in the ON condition.<br>
In accordance with yet further aspect of the present invention the universal handle coupler assembly also provides the desired flexibility of the handle unit to pad lock the same in the OFF condition with or without the door interlock. The mechanism of such construction is explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to accompanying figures 10a, 10b, 11a and 11 b.<br>
Reference is first invited to figures 10a and 10b which illustrate an option of the provision for pad locking in OFF condition without door interlock. As illustrated in said figure, this is achieved by way of the mutually interactive components wherein in the OFF condition of the operating handle (2) the same through the coupler (4) and the interlock bracket is adapted to position the shaft with the pin in a region where the interlock bracket its catch members does not obstruct the shaft pin from being released through the coupler slot for opening of the door. Thus even without operating the handle which is padlocked it is still possible to<br><br>
open the door. This can be achieved simply by unscrewing the screws (SW) used to secure the door with the housing (shown in Fig4) In such OFF condition an U-shaped cut out of the Handle along with a corresponding grooved portion of the E-plate are pad locked such that it is no more possible to rotate the handle to its ON condition. This achieves the pad locking in the OFF condition without interlocking of the door. Figure 10b illustrates in top view such a pad lock condition of the handle in the OFF condition without door interlock.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figures 11a and 11b which further illustrate the added flexibility of interlocking the door even in the OFF condition along with the pad locking. To achieve the same as illustrated in figure 11a, the lever (5) is partially rotated to a position ahead of the pad lock position and against the usual bias of the spring whereby the interlocking bracket (6) and its catch members (14, 15) cover the free release of the operating shaft pin through the slot thereby creating the desired interlock of the handle/door with respect to the operating shaft/pin. If the pad lock is then fitted to the handle and the E-plate with the defeat lever (5) ahead of the padlock a leg position of the defeat lever (5) obstructs against the pad lock and cannot retract back to its usual biased condition. In such a situation the pad locking of the handle also achieves maintaining the interlock of the door thereby providing the much desired flexibility of door interlock in the pad locked OFF condition of the handle.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed universal handle coupler assembly for switching devices and the like to on one hand provide the much required universality of the handle to connect to any desired quadrant of mounting of the switching device irrespective of the pin position thereby favouring a wider and user friendly mounting of such devices without any limitations determined by the mounting and the operating shaft pin disposition. Moreover, the universal handle coupler assembly apart from meeting the other standard requirements such as the clockwise motion of the handle to ON the system, door interlock in the ON condition, defeat mechanism in the ON condition and autorestorable interlock, further provides for the desired pad locking in OFF condition adding flexibility in terms of providing to the user the choice of pad locking in OFF condition with or without door interlock.   Such features are all<br><br>
attained by way of a simple and cost effective system development which can be adapted to any conventional switching/fuse operating mechanism and the like to thereby add on the required flexibility and safety to such devices and thereby ensure wide scale application and benefit use of such devices/systems.<br><br>
