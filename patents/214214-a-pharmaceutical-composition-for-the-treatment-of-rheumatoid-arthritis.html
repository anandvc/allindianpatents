FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of rheumatic diseases. In particular, the invention relates to methods and compositions for treating rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, by administering to a subject an effective amount of soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
No cure currently exists for rheumatic diseases. Rather, therapeutic agents are used to treat the symptoms. Typically, the therapeutic agents are administered over long periods of time and the therapeutic value is often diminished by adverse side effects.<br>
Rheumatic diseases encompass a group of diseases that affect the musculoskeletal and connective tissues of the body. These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation that often leads to permanent tissue damage, deformity, atrophy and disability. Rheumatic diseases affect the joints, bone, soft tissue, or spinal cord (Mathies, H. 1983 Rhemna) and are classified as inflammatory rheumatism, degenerative rheumatism, extra-<br><br>
articular rheumatism, or collagen diseases.   Some rheumatic diseases are known to be autoimmune diseases caused by a subject"s altered immune response.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive rheumatic disease, affecting approximately 2% of the adult population of developed countries (Utsinger, P. D., et al., 1985 Rheumatoid Arthritis, p. 140).  This disease is characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis that causes destruction of cartilage and bone erosion, leading to structural deformities in the peripheral joints.    The symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis include joint swelling, joint tenderness, inflammation, morning stiffness, and pain, especially upon flexing.    Subjects having advanced stages of arthritis suffer from structural damage, including joint destruction  with bone erosion (in: "Principals of internal  Medicine, Harrison, 13thdition, pages 1648-1655).   In addition, patients can present other clinical symptoms of various organic lesions, including lesions of the skin, kidney, heart, lung, central nervous system, and eyes due to vasculitis related to the autoimmune process.<br>
Other symptoms that correlate with rheumatoid arthritis include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and elevated levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or soluble IL-2 receptor (IL-2r). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is increased in nearly all patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The level of serum C-reactive protein is also elevated and correlates with disease activity and the likelihood of progressive joint damage. Additionally, the level of soluble IL-2r, a product of activated T-cells, is elevated in blood serum and synovial fluid of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (see; "Principals of Internal Medicine, Harrison, 13th edition, page 1650).<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis is believed to be a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, involving antigen-nonspecific intercellular interactions between T-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. In general, the magnitude of the T-cell response is determined by the co-stimulatory response elicited by the interaction between T-cell surface molecules and their ligands (Mueller, et al., 1989 Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7:445-480). Key co-stimulatory signals are provided by the interaction between T-cell surface receptors, CD28 and CTLA4, and their ligands, such as B7-rclated molecules"CD80 (i.e., B7-1) and CD86<br><br>
(i.e.. B7-2), on antigen presenting cells (Linsley. P. and Ledbetter, J. 1993 Ann. Rev. Immunol.   11:191-212).<br>
T-cell activation in the absence of co-stimulation results in anergic T-cell response (Schwartz, R. H,1992 Cell 71:1065-1068) wherein the immune system becomes nonresponsive to stimulation.<br>
Since rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be a T-cell-mediated immune system disease, one strategy to develop new agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis is to identify molecules that block co-stimulatory signals between T-lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, by blocking the interaction between endogenous CD28 or CTLA4 and B7. Potential molecules include soluble CTLA4 molecules that are modified to bind to B7 with higher avidity than willdtype CTLA4 (the sequence of which is shown in Figure 23) or CD28, thereby blocking the co-stimulatory signals.<br>
Soluble forms of CD28 and CTLA4 have been constructed by fusing variable (V)-like extracellular domains of CD28 and CTLA4 to immunoglobulin (Ig) constant domains resulting in CD28Ig and CTLA4fg.  A nucleotide and amino acid sequence of CTLA4Ig is shown in Figure 24 with the protein beginning with methionine at position +1 or alanine at position -1 and ending with lysine at position +357.   CTLA4Ig binds both CD80-positive and CD86-postive cells more strongly than CD28Ig (Linsley, P., et al 1994 Immunity 1:793-80).  Many T-cell-dependent immune responses have been found to be blocked by CTLA4lg both in vitro and in vivo. (Linsley, P., el aL 1991b, supra: Linsley, P.,   et aL, 1992a Science 257:792-795; Linsley. P., et aL, 1992b  ./. Exp. Med. 176:1595-1604; Lenschow. D.J., el al. 1992 Science 257:789-792; Tan, P., et aL, 1992 ,7. Exp. Med. 177:165-173; Turka, L.A., 1992 Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11 102-11105).<br>
To alter binding affinity to natural ligands, such as B7, soluble CTLA4Ig fusion molecules were modified by mutation of amino acids in the CTLA4 portion of the molecules. Regions of CTLA4 thai, when mutated, alter the binding affinity or avidity for B7 ligands include the complementarity determining region l(CDR-1 as described in<br><br>
U.S. Patents 6.090,914, 5.773,253, 5,844,095; in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 60/214,065:  and  by  Peach-et al.   1994. J.  Exp.  Med.,   180:2049-2058) and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR-3)-like regions (CDR-3 is the conserved region of the CTLA4 extracellular domain as described in U.S. Patents U.S. Patents 6,090,914, 5,773,253 and 5.844,095; in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 60/214,065; and by Peach, R.J., et al ./ Exp Med 1994 180:2049-2058. The CDR-3-like region encompasses the CDR-3 region and extends, by several amino acids, upstream and/or downstream of the CDR-3 motif).  The CDK-3-like region includes a hexapeptide motif MYPPPY that is highly conserved in all CD2S and CTLA4 family members. Alanine scanning mutagenesis through the hexapeptide motif in CTLA4, and at selected residues in CD28Ig, reduced or abolished binding to CD80 (Peach, R.J., et al J Exp Med 1994 180:2049-2058).<br>
Further modifications were made to soluble CTLA41g molecules by interchanging homologous regions of CTLA4 and CD28. These chimeric CTLA4/CD28 homologue mutant molecules identified the MYPPPY hexapeptide motif common to CTLA4 and CD28, as well as certain non-conserved amino acid residues in the CDR-1- and CDR-3-like regions of CTLA4, as regions responsible for increasing the binding avidity of CTLA4 with CD80 (Peach, R. J., et al., 1994 J Exp Med 180:2049-2058).<br>
Soluble CTLA4 molecules, such as CTLA4Ig, CTLA4 mutant molecules or chimeric CTLA4/CD28  homologue  mutants  as  described supra,   introduce  a  new group  of<br>
therapeutic drugs to treat rheumatic diseases.<br>
Present treatments for rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, include administering nonspecific cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, cyclosporin A. and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) blockers or antagonists. These immunosuppressive drugs suppress the entire immune system of the subject, and long-term use increases the risk of infection. Moreover, these drugs merely slow down the progress of the rheumatoid arthritis, which resumes at an accelerated pace alter the therapy is discontinued.   Additionally." prolonged therapy with<br><br><br>
these nonspecific drugs produces toxic side effects, including a tendency towards development of certain malignancies, kidney failure, bone marrow suppression, pulmonary fibrosis, malignancy, diabeies, and liver function disorders. These drugs also gradually cease being effective after about 2-5 years (Kelley"s Textbook of Rheumatology. 6lh Edition, pages 1001 -1022).<br>
Alternatively, therapeutic agents that are non-specific immunosuppressive and anti¬inflammatory drugs have been used to obtain symptom-tic relief. These drugs are dose-dependent and do not protect from disease progression. These drugs include steroid compounds, such as prednisone and methylprednisolone. Steroids also have significant toxic side effects associated with their long-term use. (Kelley"s Textbook of Rheumatology, 6lh Edition, pages 829-833).<br>
[Thus, current treatments for rheumatoid arthritis are of limited efficacy, involve <br>
significant toxic side effects, and cannot be used continuously for prolonged periods of <br>
time.	<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for treatments that- are effective and more potent for treating rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and avoids the disadvantages of conventional methods and agents, by targeting a pathophysiological mechanism of auto¬immunity.<br>

As used herein "wild type CTLA4" or "non-mutated CTLA4" has the amino acid sequence of naturally occurring, full length CTLA4 as shown in Figure 23 (also as described U.S. Patent Nos. 5,434,131, 5,844,095, 5,851,795), or any portion or derivative thereof, that recognizes and binds a B7 or interferes with a B7 so that it blocks binding to CD28   and/or   CTLA4   (e.g.,   endogenous   CD28   and/or   CTLA4).      In   particular embodiments, the extracellular domain of wild type CTLA4 begins with methionine at position +1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124, or the extracellular domain of wild type CTLA4 begins with alanine at position -1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124. Wild type CTLA4 is a cell surface protein, having an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a.C-terminai cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain binds to target molecules, such as a B7 molecule.  In a cell, the naturally occurring, wild type CTLA4 protein is translated as an immature polypeptide, which includes a signal peptide at the N-terminal end.   The immature polypeptide undergoes post-translational processing, which includes cleavage and removal of the signal peptide to generate a CTLA4 cleavage product having a newly generated N-terminal end that differs from the N-terminal end in the immature form.    One skilled in the art will appreciate that additional post-translational processing may occur, which removes one or more of the amino acids from the newly generated N-terminal"end of the CTLA4 cleavage product. Alternatively, the signal peptide may not be removed completely, generating molecules<br><br><br>
that begin before the common starting amino acid methionine. Thus, the mature CTLA4 protein may start at methionine at position +1 or alanine at position -1. The mature form of the CTLA4 molecule includes the extracellular domain or any portion thereof, which binds to B7.<br>
As used herein, a  CTLA4 mutant molecule" means wiidtype CTLA4 as shown in Figure 23 or any portion or derivative thereof, that has a mutation or multiple mutations (preferably in the extracellular domain of wiidtype CTLA4). A CTLA4 mutant molecule has a sequence that it is similar but not identical to the sequence of wild type CTLA4 molecule, but still binds a B7. The mutations may include one or more amino acid residues substituted with an amino acid having conservative (e.g., substitute a leucine with an isoleucine) or non-conservative (e.g., substitute a glycine with a tryptophan) structure or chemical properties, amino acid deletions, additions, frameshifts, or truncations.   CTLA4 mutant molecules may include a non-CTLA4 molecule therein or attached thereto.   The mutant molecules may be soluble (i.e., circulating) or bound to a cell surface.  Additional CTLA4 mutant molecules include those described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Numbers 09/865,321, 60/214,065 and 60/287,576; in U.S. Patent Numbers 6,090,914 5,844,095 and 5,773,253; and as described by Peach, R.

Typically, in the methods and/or kits of the invention, the molecules do not include a signal peptide sequence.<br>
As used herein, "soluble" refers to any molecule, or fragments and derivatives thereof, not bound or attached to a cell, i.e., circulating. For example, CTLA4, B7 or CD28 can be made soluble by attaching an immunoglobulin (Ig) moiety to the extracellular domain of CTLA4, B7 or CD28, respectively.

Typically, the soluble molecules used in the methods of the invention do not include a signal (or leader) sequence.<br>
As used herein, ""soluble CTLA4 molecules" means non-cell-surface-bound (i.e. circulating) CTLA4 molecules or any functional portion of a CTLA4 molecule that binds B7 including, but not limited to: CTLA41g fusion proteins (e.g. ATCC 68629). wherein the extracellular domain of CTLA4 is fused to an immunoglobulin (Ig) moiety rendering the fusion molecule soluble, or fragments and derivatives thereof; proteins with the<br><br><br>
extracellular domain of CTLA4 fused or joined with a portion of a biologically active or chemically active protein such as the papillomavirus E7 gene product (CTLA4-E7), melanoma-associated  antigen  p97  (CTLA4-p97)  or  HIV  env  protein  (CTLA4-env gpl20), or fragments and derivatives thereof; hybrid (chimeric) fusion proteins such as CD28/CTLA4Ig,  or  fragments and derivatives  thereof;  CTLA4 molecules  with the transmembrane domain removed to render the protein soluble (Oaks, M.

The   soluble   CTLA4 molecules used in the methods of the invention may or may not include a signal (leader) peptide sequence. Typically, in the methods of the invention, the molecules do not include a signal peptide sequence.<br>
As used herein "the extracellular domain of CTLA4" is the portion of CTLA4 that recognizes and binds CTLA4 ligands, such as B7 molecules. For example, an extracellular domain of CTLA4 comprises methionine at position +1 to aspartic acid at position +124 (Figure 23). Alternatively, an extracellular domain of CTLA4 comprises alanine at position -1 to aspartic acid at position +124 (Figure 23). The extracellular domain includes fragments or derivatives of CTLA4 that bind a B7 molecule. The extracellular domain of CTLA4 as shown in Figure 23 may also include mutations that change the binding avidity of the CTLA4 molecule for a B7 molecule.<br>
As used herein, the term "mutation" means a change in the nucleotide or amino acid sequence of a wildtype molecule, for example, a change in the DNA and/or amino acid sequences of the wild-type CTLA4 extracellular domain. A mutation in DNA may-change a codon leading to a change in the amino acid sequence. A DNA change may include substitutions, deletions, insertions, alternative splicing, or truncations. An ammo acid change may include substitutions, deletions, insertions, additions, truncations, or processing or cleavage errors of the protein. Alternatively, mutations in a nucleotide sequence may result in a silent mutation in the amino acid sequence as is well understood in the art.    In that regard, certain nucleotide codons encode the same amino acid.<br><br>
Examples include nucleotide codons CGU, CGG, CGC, and CGA encoding the amino acid, arginine (R); or codons GAU, and GAC encoding the amino acid, aspartic acid (D). Thus, a protein can be encoded by one or more nucleic acid molecules that differ in their specific nucleotide sequence, but still encode protein molecules having identical sequences. The amino acid coding sequence is as follows:<br><br>

U.S. Patent 5.354,678; Davison and Elliott, Molecular Virology: A Practical Approach (IRL Press, New York, 1993)). Other methods used for in vivo transfer include encapsulation of the nucleic acid into liposomes, and direct transfer of the liposomes, or liposomes combined with a hemagglutinating Sendai virus, to a subject (U.S. Patent 5,824,655, incorporated by reference herein). The transfected or infected cells express the protein products encoded by the nucleic acid in order to ameliorate a disease or the symptoms of a disease.<br>
In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood the following description is set forth.<br>
COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for treating immune system diseases, such as rheumatic diseases, by administering to a subject an effective amount of a ligand that binds B7 for example, soluble CTLA4 molecules (such as CTLA4Ig and/or Ll04EA29YIg) and mAbs that recognize and bind B7, An effective amount is defined as the amount of soluble CTLA4 molecules that, when bound to B7 molecules on B7-positive cells, inhibit B7 molecules from binding endogenous ligands such as CTLA4 and CD28.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the immune disease is a rheumatic disease. Rheumatic diseases are any diseases which are characterized by (i) inflammation or degeneration of musculo-skeleta! or connective tissue structures of the body, particularly the joints, and including muscles, tendons, cartilage, synovial and fibrous tissues, (ii) accompanied by joint swelling, joint tenderness, inflammation, morning stiffness, and/or pain, or impairment of locomotion or function of those structures and. in some cases, (iii) often accompanied by serological evidence of rheumatoid factor and other inflammatory surrogate markers.    <br>
Rheumatic diseases include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint swelling, joint tenderness, inflammation, morning stiffness, and pain leading to physical disability. Subjects afflicted with the advanced stages of arthritis suffer from symptoms of structural damage and debilitating pain. Other organs also can be impaired by the autoimmune mechanism.<br>
Compositions<br>
The present invention provides compositions for treating immune diseases, such as rheumatic diseases, comprising soluble CTLA4 molecules. Further, the present invention provides compositions comprising a biological agent that inhibits T-cell function but not T-cell depletion in a human by contacting B7-positive cells in the human with a soluble CTLA4. Examples of soluble CTLA4 include CTLA4Ig and soluble CTLA4 mutant molecule e.g. LI04EA29YIg.<br>
CTLA4 molecules, with mutant or wildtype sequences, may be rendered soluble by deleting the CTLA4 transmembrane segment (Oaks, M. K., et al., 2000 Cellular Immunology 201:144-153).<br>
Alternatively, soluble CTLA4 molecules, with mutant or wildtype sequences, may be fusion proteins, wherein the CTLA4 molecules are fused to non-CTLA4 moieties such as immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules that render the CTLA4 molecules soluble. For example, a CTLA4 fusion protein may include the extracellular domain of CTLA4 fused to an immunoglobulin constant domain, resulting in the CTLA4Ig molecule (Figure 24) (Linsley. P. S„ et aL 1994 Immunity 1:793-80).<br>
For clinical protocols, it is preferred that the immunoglobulin region does not elicit a detrimental immune response in a subject.   The preferred moiety is the immunoglobulin constant region, including the human or monkey immunoglobulin constant regions.   One . example of a suitable immunoglobulin region is human Cγl, including the hinge, CH2<br><br><br>
and CH3 regions which can mediate effector functions such as binding to Fc receptors, mediating complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), or mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  The immunoglobulin moiety may have one or more mutations therein, (e.g., in the CH2 domain, to reduce effector functions such as CDC or ADCC) where the mutation modulates the binding capability of the immunoglobulin to its ligand, by increasing or decreasing the binding capability of the immunoglobulin to Fc receptors. For example, mutations in the immunoglobulin may include changes in any or all its cysteine residues within the hinge domain, for example, the cysteines at positions + 130, +136, and +139 are substituted with serine (Figure 24).   The immunoglobulin molecule may also include the proline at position +148 substituted with a serine, as shown in Figure 24.   Further, the mutations in the immunoglobulin moiety may include having the leucine at position +144 substituted with phenylalanine, leucine at position + 145 substituted with glutamic acid, or glycine at position +147 substituted with alanine.<br>
Additional non-CTLA4 moieties for use in the soluble CTLA4 molecules or soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules include, but are not limited to, p97 molecule, env gpl20 molecule, E7 molecule, and ova molecule (Dash, B. et al. 1994 J. Gen. Virol. 75 (Pt 6): 1389-97; Ikeda, T., et al. 1994 Gene 138(l-2):193-6; Falk, K., et al. 1993 Cell. Immunol. 150(2):447-52; Fujisaka, K. et al. 1994 Virology 204(2):789-93). Other molecules are also possible (Gerard, C. et al. 1994 Neuroscience 62(3):721; Bym, R. et al. 1989 63(10):4370; Smith, D. et al. 1987 Science 238:1704; Lasky, L. 1996 Science 233:209).<br>

Biol. 9: 2847-2853), or CD5 (Jones, N. H. et al., (1986) Nature 323:346-349), or the signal peptide from any extracellular protein.<br><br><br>
The soluble CTLA4 molecule of the invention can include the oncostatin M signal peptide linked at the N-termina! end of the extracellular domain of CTLA4, and the human immunoglobulin molecule (e.g.. hinge, CH2 and CH3) linked to the C-terminal end of the extracellular domain (wildtype or mutated) of CTLA4, .This molecule includes the oncostatin M signal peptide encompassing an amino acid sequence havmg methionine at position -26 through alanine at position -1. the CTLA4 portion encompassing an amino acid sequence having methionine at position +1 through aspartic acid at position +124, a junction amino acid residue glutamine at position +125, and the immunoglobulin portion encompassing an amino acid sequence having glutamic acid at position +126 through lysine at position +357.<br>
Specifically, the soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules of the invention, comprising the mutated CTLA4 sequences described infra, are fusion molecules comprising human IgCγl moieties fused to the mutated CTLA4 fragments.<br>
In one embodiment, the soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules comprise IgCyl fused to a CTLA4 fragment comprising a single-site mutation in the extracellular domain. The extracellular domain of CTLA4 comprises methionine at position +1 through aspartic acid at position +124 (e.g., Figure 23). The extracellular portion of the CTLA4 can comprise alanine at position -1 through aspartic acid at position +124 (e.g., Figure 23).

Methods<br>
The invention provides methods for regulating functional CTLA4- and CD28- positive cell interactions with B7-positive cells. The methods comprise contacting the B7 positive cells with a soluble CTLA4 molecule of the invention so as to form soluble CTLA4/B7 complexes, the complexes interfering with reaction of an endogenous CTLA4 and/or CD28 molecule with a B7 molecule.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for inhibiting T-cell function but not T-cell<br>
depletion in a human by contacting B7-positive cells in the human with a soluble<br>
CTLA4. Examples of soluble CTLA4 include CTLA41g and soluble CTLA4 mutant<br>
molecule e.g. Ll04EA29YIg.	<br><br>
The present invention further provides methods for treating immune system diseases such as rheumatic diseases.   The methods comprise administering a therapeutic composition, comprising  soluble  CTLA4 molecules of the  invention, to  a subject in  an amount effective to relieve at least one of the symptoms associated with immune system diseases. Additionally, the invention may provide long-term therapy for immune system diseases by blocking the T-cell/B7-positive cell interactions, thereby blocking T-cell stimulation by co-stimulatory signals such as B7 binding to CD28, leading to induction of T-cell anergy or tolerance. Immune system diseases include, but are not limited to, autoimmune diseases, immunoproliferative diseases, and graft-related disorders.   Examples of graft-related diseases include graft versus host disease (GVHD) (e.g., such as may result from bone  marrow transplantation,  or in  the  induction of tolerance),  immune  disorders associated with graft transplantation rejection, chronic rejection, and tissue or cell allo- or xenografts, including solid organs, skin, islets, muscles, hepatocytes, neurons.  Examples of immunoproliferative  diseases   include,   but  are  not  limited  to,  psoriasis;   T cell lymphoma;   T   cell   acute   lymphoblastic   leukemia;   testicular   angiocentric   T   cell lymphoma; benign lymphocytic angiitis; and autoimmune diseases such as lupus (e.g., lupus  erythematosus,   lupus  nephritis),   Hashimoto"s  thyroiditis,  primary  myxedema, Graves" disease, pernicious anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Addison"s disease, diabetes (e.g. insulin dependent diabetes mellitis, type I diabetes mellitis, type II diabetes mellitis),  good pasture"s syndrome, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, Crohn"s disease, sympathetic ophthalmia, autoimmune uveitis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic action hepatitis, ulceratis colitis, Sjogren"s syndrome, rheumatic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), polymyositis, scleroderma, and mixed connective tissue disease.<br>
The soluble CTLA4 molecules of the invention, exhibit inhibitory properties in vivo. Under conditions where T-cel!/B7-positive cell interactions, for example T cell/B ceil interactions, are occurring as a result of contact between T cells and B7-positive cells, binding of introduced CTLA4 molecules to react to B7-positive cells, for example B ceils, may interfere, i.e., inhibit, the T celi/-B7-positive cell interactions resulting in regulation of immune responses.<br><br>
The invention provides methods for downregulating immune responses. Down regulation of an immune response by the soluble CTLA4 molecules of the invention may be by way of inhibiting or blocking an immune response already in progress or may involve preventing the induction of an immune response. The soluble CTLA4 molecules of the invention may inhibit the functions of activated T cells, such as T lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion, by suppressing T cell responses or by inducing specific tolerance in T cells, or both. Further, the soluble CTLA4 molecules of this invention, interfering with the CTLA4/CD28/B7 pathway may inhibit T-cell proliferation and/or cytokine secretion, and thus result in reduced tissue destruction and induction of T-cell unresponsiveness or anergy.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises use of the soluble CTLA4 mutant molecule L104EA29YIg to regulate functional CTLA4- and CD28- positive cell interactions with B7-positive cells, to treat immune system diseases such as rheumatic diseases and/or to downregulate immune responses.

The methods include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, oral, inhalation and subcutaneous methods, as well as implantable pump, continuous infusion, gene therapy, liposomes, suppositories, topical contact, vesicles, capsules and. injection methods. The therapeutic agent, compounded with a carrier, is commonly lyophilized for storage and is reconstituted with water or a buffered solution with a neutral pH (about pH 7-8, e.g., pH 7.5) prior to administration.<br>
As is standard practice in the art, the compositions of the invention may be administered to the subject in any pharmaceutically acceptable form.<br>
In accordance with the practice of the invention, the methods comprise administering to a subject the soluble CTLA4 molecules of the invention to regulate CD28- and/or CTLA4-positive cell interactions with" B7-positive cells. The B7-positive ceils are contacted with an effective amount of the soluble CTLA4 molecules of the invention, or fragments or derivatives thereof, so as to form soluble CTLA4/B7 complexes. The complexes interfere with interaction between endogenous CTLA4 and CD28 molecules with B7 family<br><br>
molecules.<br>
The soluble CTLA4 molecules may be administered to a subject in an amount and for a time (e.g. length of time and/or multiple times) sufficient to block endogenous B7 molecules from binding their respective ligands, in the subject. Blockage of endogenous B7/ligand binding thereby inhibiting interactions between B7-positive cells with CD28-and/or CTLA4-positive Cells..<br>
Dosage of a therapeutic agent is dependant upon many factors including, but not limited to, the type of tissue affected, the type of autoimmune disease being treated, the severity of the disease, a subject"s health and response to the treatment with the agents. Accordingly, dosages of the agents can vary depending on each subject and the mode of administration.

Prokaryotes most frequently are represented by various strains of bacteria.  The bacteria . may be a gram positive or a gram negative,  Typically, gram-negative bacteria such as E coli are preferred. Other microbial strains may also be used. Sequences encoding soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules can be inserted into a vector designed for expressing foreign sequences in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli. These vectors can include commonly used prokaryotic   control   sequences  which  are  defined   herein  to   include   promoters  for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences,    including    such    commonly    used    promoters    as    the    beta-lactamase (penicillinase)   and   lactose   (lac)   promoter  systems   (Chang,   et  al.,   (1977)   Nature 198:1056), the tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel, et al., (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8:4057) and the lambda derived PL promoter and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake,-et al, (1981) Nature 292:128).<br><br>
Such expression vectors will also include origins of replication and selectable markers, such as a beta-lactamase or neomycin phosphotransferase gene conferring resistance to antibiotics, so that the vectors can replicate in bacteria and cells carrying the plasmids can be selected for when grown in the presence of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or kanamycin.<br>
The expression piasmid can be introduced into prokaryotic cells via a variety of standard methods, including but not limited to CaCl2-shock (Cohen, (1972) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69:2110, and Sambrook et al. (eds.), "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual". 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, (1989)) and electroporation.<br>
In accordance with the practice of the invention, eukaryotic cells are also suitable host cells.     Examples  of eukaryotic  cells  include  any  animal  cell,  whether primary  or immortalized, yeast (e.g., Saccharomvces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Pichia pastoris), and plant cells.  Myeloma, COS and CHO cells are examples of animal cells that may be used as hosts.   Particular CHO cells include, but are not limited to, DG44 (Chasm, et  la.,   1986 Som.  Cell.  Molec.  Genet.   12:555-556;  Kolkekar  1997 Biochemistry 36:10901-10909), CHO-K1 (ATCC No. CCL-61), CHO-K1 Tet-On cell line (Clontech), CHO designated ECACC 85050302 (CAMR, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK), CHO clone 13 (GEIMG, Genova, IT), CHO clone B (GEIMG, Genova, IT), CHO-K1/SF designated ECACC 93061607 (CAMR, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK), and  RR^CHOKl designated ECACC 92052129 (CAMR, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). Exemplary plant cells include tobacco (whole plants, cell culture, or callus), corn, soybean, and rice cells. Com. soybean, and rice seeds are also acceptable.<br>
Nucleic acid sequences encoding the CTLA4 mutant molecules can also be inserted into a vector designed for expressing foreign sequences in an eukaryotic host. The regulatory elements of the vector can vary according to the particular eukaryotic host.<br>
Commonly used eukaryotic control sequences for use in expression vectors include promoters and control sequences compatible with mammalian cells such as, for example.<br><br>
CMV promoter (CDM8 vector) and avian sarcoma virus (ASV) (JILN vector). Other commonly used promoters include the early and late promoters from Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (Fiers, et al., (1973) Nature 273:113), or other viral promoters such as those, derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and bovine papilloma virus. An inducible promoter, such as hMTII (Karin, et al., (1982) Nature 299:797-802) may also be used.<br>
Vectors for expressing CTLA4 mutant molecules in eukaryotes may also carry sequences called enhancer regions. These are important in optimizing gene expression and are found either upstream or downstream of the promoter region.<br>
Examples of expression vectors for eukaryotic host cells include, but are not limited to, vectors for mammalian host cells (e.g., BPV-1, pHyg, pRSV, pSV2, pTK2 (Maniatis); pIRES (Clontech); pRc/CMV2, pRc/RSV, pSFVl (Life Technologies); pVPakc Vectors, pCMV vectors, pSG5 vectors (Stratagene)), retroviral vectors (e.g., pFB vectors (Stratagene)), pCDNA-3 (Invitrogen) or modified forms thereof, adenoviral vectors; Adeno-associated virus vectors, baculovirus vectors, yeast vectors (e.g., pESC vectors (Stratagene)).<br>
Nucleic acid sequences encoding CTLA4 mutant molecules can integrate into the genome of the eukaryotic host cell and replicate as the host genome replicates. Alternatively, the vector carrying CTLA4 mutant molecules can contain origins of replication allowing for extrachromosomal replication.<br>
For expressing the nucleic acid sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the origin of replication from the endogenous yeast plasmid, the 2u. circle can be used. (Broach, (1983) Meth. Enz. 101:307). Alternatively, sequences from the yeast genome capable of promoting autonomous replication can be used (see, for example, Stinchcomb et al.. (1979) Nature 282:39); Tschemper et al.. (1980) Gene 10:157; and Clarke et al., (1983) Meth. Enz. 101:300).<br><br>
Transcriptional control sequences for yeast vectors include promoters for the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes (Hess et al., (1968) J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 7:149; Holland et al.. (1978) Biochemistry 17:4900). Additional promoters known in the art include the CMV promoter provided in the CDM8 vector (Toyama and Okayama, (1990) FEBS 268:217-221); the promoter for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255:2073), and those for other glycolytic enzymes.<br>
Other promoters are inducible because they can be regulated by environmental stimuli or by the growth medium of the cells. These inducible promoters include those from the genes for heat shock proteins, alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, enzymes associated with nitrogen catabolism, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization.<br>
Regulatory sequences may also be placed at the 3" end of the coding sequences. These sequences may act to stabilize messenger RNA. Such terminators are found in the 3" untranslated region following the coding sequences in several yeast-derived and mammalian genes.<br>
Exemplary vectors for plants and plant cells include, but are not limited to, Agrobacterium T1 plasmids, cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), and tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV).<br>
General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel (U.S. Patent No. 4,399.216 issued Aug. 16, 1983). Mammalian cells can be transformed by methods including but not limited to, transfection in the presence of calcium phosphate, microinjection, electroporation, or via transduction with viral vectors.<br>
Methods for introducing foreign DNA sequences into plant and yeast genomes include (1 ) mechanical methods, such as microinjection of DNA into single cells or protoplasts, vortexing cells with glass beads in the presence of DNA, or shooting DNA-coated tungsten or gold spheres into cells or protoplasts; (2) introducing DNA by making ceil<br><br>
membranes permeable to macromolecuies through polyethylene glycol treatment or subjection to high voltage electrical pulses (electroporation); or (3) the use of liposornes (containing cDNA) which fuse to cell"membranes.<br>
Once the CTLA4 mutant molecules of the inventions are expressed, they can be harvested by methods well known in the art such as cell lysis (e.g. sonication, lysozyme and/or detergents) and protein recovery performed using standard protein purification means, e.g., affinity chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography, to yield substantially pure product (R. Scopes in: "Protein Purification, Principles and Practice", Third Edition, Springer-Verlag (1994); Sambrook et al. (eds.), "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, (1989)). Expression of CTLA4 mutant molecules can be detected by methods known in the art. For example, the mutant molecules can be detected by Coomassie staining SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting using antibodies that bind CTLA4.<br>
The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of<br>
ordinary skill in making and using the same. The examples are not intended in any way to<br>
otherwise limit the scope of the invention.	<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following provides a description of the methods used to generate the nucleotide sequences encoding the CTLA4 molecules of the invention.<br>
A CTLA4Ig encoding plasmid was first constructed, and shown to express CTLA4Ig molecules as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,434,131, 5,885,579 and 5,851,795. Then single-site mutant molecules (e.g., L104EIg) were generated from the CTLA4Ig encoding sequence, expressed and tested for binding kinetics for various B7 molecules. The LI04EIg nucleotide sequence (as included in the sequence shown in Figure 18) was used as a template to generate the doubie-site CTLA4 mutant sequences (as included in the sequences shown in Figures  19-22) which were expressed as proteins and tested for<br><br>
binding kinetics. The double-site CTLA4 mutant sequences include: L104EA29YIg. L104EA29LIg. L104EA29TIg, and LI04EA29WIg. Triple-site mutants were also generated.<br>
CTLA4Ig Construction<br>
A genetic construct encoding CTLA4Ig comprising the extracellular domain of CTLA4 and an IgCgammal domain was constructed as described in U.S. Patents 5,434,131, 5,844,095 and 5,851,795, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. The extracellular domain of the CTLA4 gene was cloned by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the published sequence (Dariavach et al, Eur. Joum. Immunol. 18:1901-1905(1988)).<br>
Because a signal peptide for CTLA4 was not identified in the CTLA4 gene, the N-<br>
terminus of the predicted sequence of CTLA4 was fused to the signal peptide of<br>
oncostatin M (Malik et al, Mot, and Cell. Biol. 9:2847 (1989)) in two steps using<br>
overlapping     oligonucleotides.	For     the     first     step,     the     oligonucleotide,<br>
CTCAGTCTGGTCCTTGCACTCCTGTTTCCAAGCATGGCGAGCATGGCAATGCA CGTGGCCCAGCC (which encoded the C terminal 15 amino acids from the oncostatin M signal peptide fused to the N terminal 7 amino acids of CTLA4) was used as forward primer,   and   TTTGGGCTCCTGATCAGAATCTGGGCACGGTTG  (encoding   amino acid residues  119-125  of the amino acid sequence encoding CTLA4 receptor and containing a Bel I restriction enzyme site) as reverse primer.  The template for this step was" cDNA synthesized from 1  micro g of total RNA from H38 cells (an HTLV H infected T-cell leukemic cell line provided by Drs. Salahudin and Gallo, NCI, Bethesda. MD).    A portion of the PCR product from the first step was reamplified, using an overlapping forward primer, encoding the N terminal portion of the oncostatin M signal peptide      and      containing      a      Hind      JJJ      restriction      endonuciease      sue, CTAGCCACTGAAGCTTCACCAATGGGTGTACTGCTCACACAGAGGACGCTGC TCAGTCTGGTCCTTGCACTG and the same reverse primer.  The product of the PCR reaction was digested with Hind III and Bel I and ligated together with a Bel  1/Xba I<br><br><br>
cleaved cDNA fragment encoding the ammo acid sequences corresponding to the hinge. CH2 and CH3 regions of IgC(gamma)l into the Hind III/Xba I cleaved expression vector, CDM8 or Hind III/Xba I cleaved expression vector piLN (also known as LN).<br>
DNA encoding the amino acid sequence corresponding to CTLA4Ig has been deposited with the ATCC under the Budapest Treaty on May 31, 1991. and has been accorded ATCC accession number 68629.<br>
CTLA4Ig Codon Based Mutagenesis:<br>
A mutagenesis and  screening strategy was  developed to  identify mutant CTLA4Ig molecules that had slower rates of dissociation ("off rates) from CD80 and/or CD86 molecules i.e. improved binding ability.  In this embodiment, mutations were carried out in and/or about the residues in the CDR-1, CDR-2 (also known as the C strand) and/or CDR-3 regions of the extracellular domain of CTLA4 (as described in U.S. Patents U.S. Patents 6,090,914, 5,773,253 and 5,844,095; in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 60/214,065; and by Peach, R.J., et alJ Exp Med 1994 180:2049-2058.  A CDR-like region encompasses the each CDR region and extends, by several ammo acids, upstream and/or downstream of the CDR motif).    These sites were chosen based on studies of chimeric CD28/CTLA4 fusion proteins (Peach et al., J. Exp. Med..  1994, 180:2049-2058), and on a model predicting which amino acid residue side chains would be solvent exposed, and a lack of amino acid residue identity or homology at certain positions between CD28 and CTLA4.    Also, any residue which is spatially in close proximity (5 to 20 Angstrom units) to the identified residues is considered part of the present invention.<br>
To synthesize and screen soluble CTLA4 mutant molecuies with altered affinities for a B7 molecule (e.g. CD80. CD86). a two-step strategy was adopted. The experiments entailed first generating a library of mutations at a specific codon of an extracellular portion of CTLA.4 and then, screening these by BlAcore analysis to identify- mutants with altered reactivity to B7. The Biacore assay system (Pharmacia. Piscataway, N.J.) uses a<br><br><br>
surface plasmon resonance detector system that essentially involves covalent binding of either CD801g or CD86Ig to a dextran-coated sensor chip which is located in a detector. The test molecule can then be injected into the chamber containing the sensor chip and the amount of complementary protein that binds can be assessed based on the change in molecular mass which is physically associated with the dextran-coated side of the sensor chip; the change in molecular mass can be measured by the detector system.<br>
Specifically, single-site mutant nucleotide sequences were generated using non-mutated (e.g., wild-type) DNA encoding CTLA4Ig (U.S. Patent Nos: 5,434,131, 5,844,095; 5,851,795; and 5,885,796; ATCC Accession No. 68629) as a template. Mutagenic oligonucleotide PCR primers were designed for random mutagenesis of a specific codon by allowing any base at positions 1 and 2 of the codon, but only guanine or thymine at position 3 (XXG/Tor also noted as NNG/T). In this manner, a specific codon encoding an amino acid could be randomly mutated to code for each of the 20 amino acids. In that regard, XXG/T mutagenesis yields 32 potential codons encoding each of the 20 amino acids. PCR products encoding mutations in close proximity to the CDR3-like loop of CTLA4Ig (MYPPPY), were digested with Sacl/Xbal and subcloned into similarly cut CTLA4Ig (as included in Figure 24) LN expression vector. This method was used to . generate the single-site CTLA4 mutant molecule L104EIg (as included in Figure 18).<br>
For mutagenesis in proximity to the CDR-1-like loop of CTLA4Ig, a silent Nhel restriction site was first introduced 5" to this loop, by PCR primer-directed mutagenesis. PCR products were digested with Nhel/Xbal and subcloned into similarly cut CTLA4Ig or L104EIg expression vectors. This method was used to generate the double-site CTLA4 mutant molecule Ll04EA29YIg (as included in Figure 19). In particular, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the single-site CTLA4 mutant molecule, L104EIg, was used as a template to generate the double-site CTLA4 mutant molecule. L104EA29YIg.<br>
The double-site mutant nucleotide sequences encoding CTLA4 mutant molecules, such as LI04EA29YIg (deposited on June 19. 2000 with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 20110-2209 and accorded<br><br><br>
ATCC accession number PTA-2104), were generated by repeating the mutagenesis procedure described above using L104EIg as a template. This method was used to generate numerous double-site mutants nucleotide sequences such as those encoding CTLA4 molecules L104EA29YIg (as included in the sequence shown in Figure 19),  L104EA29LIg (as included in the sequence shown in Figure 20), Ll04EA29TIg (as included in the sequence shown in Figure 21), and L104EA29Wlg (as included in the sequence shown in Figure 22). Triple-site mutants, such as those encoding L104EA29YS25KIg, L104EA29YS25NIg and L104EA29YS25RJg, were also generated<br>
The soluble CTLA4 molecules were expressed from the nucleotide sequences and used in the phase II clinical studies described in Example 3, infra.<br>
As those skilled-in-the-art will appreciate, replication of nucleic acid sequences, especially by PCR amplification, easily introduces base changes into DNA strands. However, nucleotide changes do not necessarily translate into amino acid changes as some codons redundantly encode the same amino acid. Any changes of nucleotide from the original or wildtype sequence, silent (i.e. causing no change in the translated amino acid) or otherwise, while not explicitly described herein, are encompassed within the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The following example provides a description of the screening methods used to identify the single- and doubie-site mutant CTLA polypeptides, expressed from the constructs described in Example 1, that exhibited a higher binding avidity for B7 molecules, compared to non-mutated CTLA4Ig molecules.<br>
Current in vicro and in vivo studies indicate that CTLA4lg by itself is unable to completely block the priming of antigen specific activated T cells. In vitro studies with CTLA4Ig and either monoclonal antibody specific for CD80 or CD86 measuring inhibition of T cell proliferation indicate that anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody did not<br><br><br>
augment CTLA4Ig inhibition. However, anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody did augment the inhibition, indicating that CTLA4Ig was not as effective at blocking CD86 interactions. These data support earlier findings by Linsley et al. (Immunity, (1994), 1:793-801) showing inhibition of CDSO-rnediated cellular responses required approximately 100 fold lower CTLA4Ig concentrations than for CD86-mediated responses. Based on these findings, it was surmised that soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules having a higher avidity for CD86 than wild type CTLA4 should be better able to block the priming of antigen specific activated cells than CTLA4Ig.<br>
To this end, the soluble CTLA4 mutant molecules described in Example 1 above were screened using a novel screening procedure to identify several mutations in the extracellular domain of CTLA4 that improve binding avidity for CD80 and CD86. This screening strategy provided an effective method to directly identify mutants with apparently slower "off rates without the need for protein purification or quantitation since "off rate determination is concentration independent (O"Shannessy et al., (1993) Anal. Biochem.. 212:457-468).<br>
COS cells were transfected with individual miniprep purified plasmid DNA and propagated for several days. Three day conditioned culture media was applied to BIAcore biosensor chips (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) coated with soluble CD801g or CD86Ig. The specific binding and dissociation of mutant proteins was measured by surface plasmon resonance (O"Shannessy, D. J., et al., 1997 Anal. Biochem. 212:457-468). All experiments were run on BIAcore™ or BIAcore™ 2000 biosensors at 25°C. Ligands were immobilized on research grade NCM5 sensor chips (Pharmacia) using standard N-ethyl-N"-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimidN-hydroxysuccinimide coupling (Johnsson, B., et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 198: 268-277; Khilko, S.N.. et al.(1993) J. Biol. Chem 268:5425-15434).<br><br><br>
Screening Method<br>
COS cells grown in 24 well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected with mutant CTLA4Ig. Culture media containing secreted soluble mutant CTLA4Ig was collected 3 days later.<br>
Conditioned COS cell culture media was allowed to flow over BlAcore biosensor chips derivitized with CD86Ig or CD80Ig (as described in Greene et al., 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271:26762-26771), and mutant molecules were identified with off-rates slower than that observed for wild type CTLA4Ig. The DNAs corresponding to selected media samples were sequenced and more DNA prepared to perform larger scale COS cell transient transfection, from which CTLA4Ig mutant protein was prepared following protein A purification of culture media.<br>
BlAcore analysis conditions and equilibrium binding data analysis were performed as described in J. Greene et al 1996 ,/. Biol, Chem. 271:26762-26771 and in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 09/579.927. and 60/214,065 which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BlAcore Data Analysis<br>
Senosorgram baselines were normalized to zero response units (RU) prior to analysis. Samples were run over mock-derivatized flow cells to determine background RU values due to bulk refractive index differences between solutions. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from plots of Req versus C, where Keq is the steady-state response minus the response on a mock-derivatized chip, and C is the molar concentration of analyte. Binding curves were analyzed using commercial nonlinear curve-fitting software (Prism, GraphPAD Software).<br>
Experimental data were first fit to a mode! for a single ligand binding to a single receptor (1-site model, i.e., a simple langmuir system, A+BAB), and equilibrium association<br><br>
constants (Kd=[A]•[B]\[AB]) were calculated from the equation R=RmaxC/(Kd+C). Subsequently, data were fit to the simplest two-site model of ligand binding (i.e.. to a receptor having two non-interacting independent binding sites as described by the equation R=Rmax]•C\(Kd1+C)+Rmax2•C\(Kd2+C).<br>
The goodness-of-fits of these two models were analyzed visually by comparison with experimental data and statistically by an F test of the sums-of-squares. The simpler one-site model was chosen as the best fit, unless the two-site model fit significantly better (p
Association and disassociation analyses were performed using BIA evaluation 2.1 Software (Pharmacia). Association rate constants kon were calculated in two ways, assuming both homogenous single-site interactions and parallel two-site interactions. For single-site interactions, kon values were calculated according to the equation Rt=Req(l-exp"ks(1-1"o), where Rt is a response at a given time, t; Req is the steady-state response; to is the time at the start of the injection; and ks=dR/dt=kon"Ck0ff, where C is a concentration of analyte, calculated in terms of monomeric binding sites. For two-site interactions kon values were calculated according to the equation Rt=Req1(l-expks(1-1) o)+Req2(l-expks2(1-1)o)-For each model, the values of kon were determined from the calculated slope (to about 70% maximal association) of plots of ks versus C.<br>
Dissociation data" were analyzed according to one site (AB=A+B) or two site (AiBj=Ai+Bj) models, and rate constants (k0ff) were calculated from best fit curves. The binding site model was used except when the residuals were greater than machine background (2-10RU. according to machine), in which case the two-binding site model was employed. Half-times of receptor occupancy were calculated using the relationship t1/2=0.693/koff-.<br><br><br>
Flow Cytometry:<br>
Murine mAb L307.4 (anti-CD80) was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose. California) and IT2.2 (anti-B7-0 [also known as CD86]), from Pharmingen (San Diego, California). For immunostaining, CD80-positive and/or CD86-positive CHO cells were removed from their culture vessels by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10mM EDTA. CHO cells (1-10 x 105) were first incubated with mAbs or immunoglobulin fusion proteins in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-human immunoglobulin second step reagents (Tago, Burlingame, California). Cells were given a final wash and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).<br>
SDS-PAGE and Size Exclusion Chromatography<br>
SDS-PAGE was performed on Tris/glycine 4-20% acrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Analytical gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and images of wet gels were obtained by digital scanning. CTLA4Ig (25 ug) and L104EA29YIg (25 μg) were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a TSK-GEL G300 SWXL_ column (7.8 x 300mm, Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA) equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.02% NAN3 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.<br>
CTLA4Xc120s and L104EA29YXc120s.<br>
Single chain CTLA4Xc;20S w^s prepared as previously described (Linstey eL ai., (1995) J. Biol. Chem.. 270:15417-15424). Briefly, an oncostatin M CTLA4 (OMCTLA4) expression plasmid was used as a template, the forward primer. GAGGTGATAAAGCTTCACCAATGGGTGTACTGCTCACACAG was chosen to match sequences in the vector; and the reverse primer. GTGGTGTATTGGTCTAGATCAATCAGAATCTGGGCACGGTTC corresponded to the last seven aminio acids (i.e. amino acids 118-124) in the extracellular domain of CTLA4. and contained a restriction enzyme site, and a stop codon (TGA).   The reverse<br><br><br>
primer specified a C120S (cysteine to serine at position 120) mutation. In particular, the nucleotide sequence GCA (nucleotides 34-36) of the reverse primer shown above is replaced with one of the following nucleotide sequences: AGA, GGA, TGA, CGA, ACT. or GCT.  As persons skilled in the art will understand, the nucleotide sequence GCA is a<br>
   reversed complementary sequence of the codon TGC for cysteine. Similarly, the nucleotide sequences AGA, GGA, TGA, CGA, ACT, or GCT are the reversed con"  lementary sequences of the codons for serine. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with Hind/ll/Xbal and directionally subcloned into the expression vector LN (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ).   L104EA29YXc12os was prepared<br>
      in an identical manner. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing.<br>
Identification and Biochemical Characterization of High Avidity Mutants<br>
Twenty four amino acids were chosen for mutagenesis and the resulting -2300 mutant proteins assayed for CD86Ig binding by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; as described, supra). The predominant effects of mutagenesis at each site are summarized in Table II, infra. Random mutagenesis of some amino acids in the CDR-1 region (S25-R33) apparently did not alter ligand binding. Mutagenesis of E31 and R33 and residues M97-Y102 apparently resulted in reduced ligand binding. Mutagenesis of residues, S25, A29, and T30, K.93, L96, Y103, LI04, and G105, resulted in proteins with slow "on" and/or slow "off rates. These results confirm previous findings that residues in the CDR-1 (S25-R33) region, and residues in or near M97-Y102 influence ligand; binding (Peach et al„ (1994) J. Exp. Med.. 180:2049-2058).<br>
Mutagenesis of sites S25. T30, K93, L96, Y103, and G105 resulted in the identification of some mutant proteins that had slower "off rates from CD86Ig. However, in these instances, the slow "off rate was compromised by a siow "on" rate that resulted in mutant proteins with an overall avidity for CD86Ig that was apparently similar to that seen with wild type CTLA4Ig. In addition, mutagenesis of K93 resulted in significant aggregation that may have been responsible for the kinetic changes observed.<br><br><br>
Random mutagenesis of L104 followed by COS ceil transfection and screening by SPR of culture media samples over immobilized CD86Ig yielded six media samples containing mutant proteins with approximately 2-fold slower "off rates than wild type CTLA4Ig. When the corresponding cDNA of these mutants were sequenced, each was found to encode a leucine to glutamic acid mutation (L104E). Apparently, substitution of leucine 104 to aspartic acid (L104D) did not affect CD86Ig binding.<br>
Mutagenesis was then repeated at each site listed in Table If this time using L104E as the PCR template instead of wild type CTLA4Ig, as described above, SPR analysis, again using, immobilized CD86Ig, identified six culture media samples from mutagenesis of alanine 29 with proteins having approximately 4-fold slower "off rates than wild type CTLA4Ig. The two slowest were tyrosine substitutions (L104EA29Y). two were leucine (L104EA29L), one was tryptophan (L104EA29W), and one was threonine (L104EA29T). Apparently, no slow "off" rate mutants were identified when alanine 29 was randomly mutated, alone, in wild type CTLA4Ig.<br>
The relative molecular mass and state of aggregation of purified L104E and L104EA29YIg was assessed by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. L104EA29YIg (~1 jug; lane 3) and L104EIg (~1 u.g; lane 2) apparently had the same electrophoretic mobility as CTLA4Ig (~1 μg; lane 1) under reducing (~-50kDa; +βME; plus 2-mercaptoethanol) and non-reducing (~100kDa; -βME) conditions (FIG. 25A). Size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that L104EA29YIg (FIG. 25C) apparently had the same mobility as dimeric CTLA4Ig (FIG. 25B). The major peaks represent protein dimer while the faster eluting minor peak in FIG. 25B represents higher molecular weight aggregates. Approximately 5.0% of CTLA4Ig was present as higher molecular weight aggregates but there was no evidence of aggregation of L104EA29YIg or L104EIg. Therefore, the stronger binding to CD86Ig seen with L104EIg and Ll04EA29YIg could not be attributed to aggregation induced by mutagenesis.<br><br><br>
Equilibrium and Kinetic Binding Analysis<br>
Equilibrium and kinetic binding analysis was performed on protein A purified CTLA4Ig, Ll04EIg, and L104EA29YIg using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The results are shown in Table I, infra. Observed equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd; Table I) were calculated from binding curves generated over a range of concentrations (5.0-200 nM). L104EA29~"Ig binds more strongly to CD86Ig than does L104EIg or CTLA4Ig. The lower Kd of L104EA29YIg (3.21 nM) than L104Elg (6.06 nM) or CTLA4Ig (13.9 nM) indicates higher binding avidity of L104EA29YIg to CD86Ig. The lower Kd of L104EA29YIg (3.66 nM) than L104EIg (4.47 nM) or CTLA4Ig (6.51 nM) indicates higher binding avidity of L104EA29YIg to CD80Ig.<br>
Kinetic binding analysis revealed that the comparative "on" rates for CTLA4Ig, L104EIg, and L104EA29YIg binding to CD80 were similar, as were the "on" rates for CD86Ig (Table I). However, "off rates for these molecules were not equivalent (Table 1). Compared to CTLA4Ig, L104EA29Ylg had approximately 2-fold slower "off rate from CD80Ig, and approximately 4-fold slower, "off rate from CD86Ig. L104E had "off rates intermediate between L104EA29YIg and CTLA4Ig. Since the introduction of these mutations did not significantly affect "on" rates, the increase in avidity for CD80Ig and CD861g observed with L104EA29YIg was likely primarily due to a decrease in "off rates.<br>
To determine whether the increase in avidity of Ll04EA29YIg for CD86Ig and CD80Ig was due to the mutations affecting the way each monomer associated as a dimer. or whether there were avidity enhancing structural changes introduced into each monomer. single chain constructs of CTLA4 and L104EA29Y extracellular domains were prepared following mutagenesis of cysteine 120 to serine as described supra, and by Linsley et ah, (1995) 1. Biol. Chem.. 270:15417-15424 (84). The purified proteins CTLA4Xc120s and L104EA29YXC120s were shown to be monomelic by gel permeation chromatography (Linsley et a!., (1995), supra), before their iigand binding properties were analyzed by SPR.   Results showed that binding affinity of both monomeric proteins for CD86Ig was<br><br><br>
approximately 35-80-fold less than that seen for their respective dimers (Table 1). This supports previously published data establishing that dimerization of CTLA4 was required for high avidity ligand binding (Greene et ah, (1996) J. Biol. Chem., 271.:26762-26771).<br>
L104EA29YXci20S bound with approximately 2-fold higher affinity than CTLA4X"c120s to both CD80Ig and CD86Ig. The increased affinity was due to approximately 3-fold slower rate of dissociation from both ligands. Therefore, stronger ligand binding by L104EA29Y was most likely due to avidity enhancing structural changes that had been introduced into each monomeric chain rather than alterations in which the molecule dimerized.<br>
Location and Structural Analysis of Avidity Enhancing Mutations<br>
The solution structure of the extracellular IgV-like domain of CTLA4 has recently been determined by NMR spectroscopy (Metzler et al., (1997) Nature _Struct. Biol., 4:527-531).     This allowed accurate  location  of leucine   104  and  alanine 29 in the  three dimensional fold (FIG. 26 left and right depictions).   Leucine 104 is situated near the highly conserved MYPPPY amino acid sequence.   Alanine 29 is situated near the C-terminal end of the CDR-1 (S25-R33) region, which is spatially adjacent to the MYPPPY region.   While there is significant interaction between residues at the base of these two regions, there is apparently no direct interaction between LI04 and A29 although they both comprise part of a contiguous hydrophobic core in the protein.    The structural consequences of the two avidity enhancing mutants were assessed by modeling.   The A.29Y mutation can be easily accommodated in the cleft between the CDR-1 (S25-R33) region and the MYPPPY region, and may serve to stabilize the conformation of the MYPPPY region.   In wild type CTLA4, LI04 forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with L96 and V94 near the MYPPPY region.  It is highly unlikely that the glutamic acid nutation adopts a conformation similar to that of LI04 for two reasons.   First, there is insufficient space to accommodate the longer glutamic acid side chain in the structure without significant perturbation to the CDR-1 (S25-R33 region).   Second, the energetic :osts of burying the negative charge of the glutamic acid side chain in the hydrophobic<br><br>
region would be large. Instead, modeling studies predict that the glutamic acid side chain flips out on to the surface where its charge can be stabilized by solvation. Such a conformational change can easily be accommodated by G105, with minimal distortion to other residues in the regions.<br>
Binding of High Avidity Mutants to CHQ Cells Expressing CD80 or CD86<br>
FACS analysis (Fig. 27) of CTLA4Ig and mutant molecules binding to stably transfected CD80+ and CD86+CHO cells was performed as described herein. CD80-positive and CD86-positive CHO cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or L104EIg, and then washed. Bound immunoglobulin fusion protein was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin.<br>
As shown in Figure 27, CD80-positive or CD86-positive CHO cells (l.5x105) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CTLA4Ig (closed squares), L104EA29YIg (circles), or L104EIg (triangles) for 2 hr. at 23°C, washed, .and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin antibody. Binding on a total of 5,000 viable cells was analyzed (single determination) on a FACScan, and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined from data histograms using PC-LYSYS. Data were corrected for background fluorescence measured on cells incubated with second step reagent only (MFI = 7). Control L6 mAb (80 μg/ml) gave MFI 
Binding of L104EA29YIg, L104EIg. and CTLA4Ig to human CD80-transfected CHO cells is approximately equivalent (FIG. 27A). L104EA29YIg and L104EIg bind more strongly to CHO cells stably transfected with human CD86 than does CTLA4Ig (FIG. 27B).<br><br><br>
Functional Assays:<br>
Human  CD4-positive  T cells were  isolated  by  immunomagnetic  negative  selection (Linsley et al., (1992) J. Exp. Med. 176:1595-1604).  Isolated CD4-positive T cells were stimulated with phorbal myristate acetate (PMA) plus CD80-positive or CD86-positive CHO cells in the presence of titrating concentrations of inhibitor.   CD4-positive T cells (8-10 x 104/well) were cutured in the presence of 1 nM PMA with or without irradiated CHO cell stimulators.    Proliferative responses were measured by the addition of 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine during the final 7 hours of a 72 hour culture.   Inhibition of PMA  plus   CD80-positive   CHO,   or  CD86-positive   CHO,   stimulated   T   cells   by L104EA29YIg and  CTLA4Ig was performed.     The  results are shown in FIG.  28. L104EA29YIg inhibits proliferation of CD80-positive PMA treated CHO cells more than CTLA4Ig (FIG. 28A).  L104EA29YIg is also more effective than CTLA4Ig at inhibiting proliferation   of CD86-positive  PMA   treated   CHO   cells   (FIG.   28B).      Therefore, L104EA29YIg   is   a   more   potent   inhibitor   of  both   CD80-   and   CD86-mediated costimulation of T cells.<br>
Figure 29 shows inhibition by L104EA29YIg and CTLA4Ig of allostimulated human T cells prepared above, and further allostimulated with a human B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) called PM that expressed CD80 and CD86 (T cells at 3.0xl04/weil and PM at 8.0x103/well). Primary allostimulation occurred for 6 days, then the cells were pulsed with 3H-fhymidine for7 hours, before incorporation of radiolabel was determined.<br>
Secondary allostimulation was performed as follows. Seven day primary allostimulated T cells were harvested over lymphocyte separation medium (LSM) (ICN, Aurora. OH) and rested for 24 hours. T cells were then restimulated (secondary), in the presence of titrating amounts of CTLA4Ig or LI04EA29YIg, by adding PM in the same ratio as above. Stimulation occurred for 3 days, then the cells were pulsed with radiolabel and harvested as above. The effect of Ll04EA29YIg on primary allostimulated T cells is shown in FIG. 29A.  The effect of L104EA29YIg on secondary-allostimulated T cells is<br><br>
shown in FIG. 29B. L104EA29YIg inhibits both primary and secondary T cell proliferative responses better than CTLA4Ig. -<br>
To measure cytokine production (Figure 30), duplicate secondary allostimulation plates were set up. After 3 days, culture media was assayed using ELISA kits (Biosource, Camarillo, CA) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. L104EA29YIg was found to be more potent than CmLA4Ig at blocking T cell IL-2, IL-4, and y-IFN cytokine production following a secondary allogeneic stimulus (FIGS. 30A-C).<br>
The effects of L104EA29YIg and CTLA4Ig on monkey mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) are shown in Figure 31. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC"S; 3.5xl04 cells/well from each monkey) from 2 monkeys were purified over lymphocyte separation medium (LSM) and mixed with 2μg/ml phytohemaglutinin (PHA). The cells were stimulated 3 days then pulsed with radiolabel 16 hours before harvesting. L104EA29YIg inhibited monkey T cell proliferation better than CTLA4Ig.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
The following provides a description of phase II clinical studies of human patients administered soluble CTLA4 mutant molecule L104EA29YIg (also known as LEA29Y or LEA) or CTLA4Ig, to relieve at least one symptom associated with rheumatoid arthritis,  including reducing: joint swelling, joint tenderness, inflammation, morning stiffness, and pain.    The CTLA4Ig molecule used herein begins with methionine at position +1 (or alternatively with alanine at position -1) and ends with lysine at position +357 as shown in Figure 24.   DNA encoding an embodiment of the CTLA4Ig molecule has been deposited as ATCC 68629.   The L104EA29YIg molecule used herein begins with methionine at position +1 (or alternatively with alanine at position -1) and ends with lysine at position +357 as shown in Figure 19.   DNA encoding an embodiment of the LI04EA29YIg molecule has been deposited as ATCC PTA 2104.<br>
Additionally, the following provides a description of human patients administered L104EA29YIg or CTLA4Ig to relieve at least one biological surrogate marker associated with rheumatoid arthritis, including reducing erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and serum levels of C-reactive protein and/or IL2 receptor.<br>
Patient Cohorts<br>
A totai of 214 patients, including 54 males and 160 females, participated in the study (Figures 1 A. 1B). The patients at baseline had a mean disease duration of 3.4 v±2.0"i years and had failed at least one Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (DMARD). Stable Nonsteroidal Ami-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) or steroids (
<br><br>
into groups of 25 to 32 patients per treatment group. Thirty-two patients received a placebo, 92 received L104EA29YIg, and 90 received CTLA4Ig. The patients who followed protocol guidelines and did not discontinue before day 57 received a total of 4 intravenous infusions, one infusion each on days 1,15, 29, and 57. All patients were evaluated on days 1,15, 29, 43, 57, 71, and 85. The doses administered included 0.5, 2.0, or 10.0 mg/kg of L104EA29YIg (denoted as LEA.5, LEA2 and LEA10, respectively in Figures 1A-1E) ov of CTLA4Ig (denoted as CTLA.5, CTLA2 and CTLA10, respectively inFigures 1A-1E).<br>
All subjects were monitored for peri-infusional adverse events and global safety by answering a questionnaire listing potential adverse events. The patients were questioned about potential adverse events that may have occurred within twenty-four hours post-infusion. In addition, the patients were encouraged to spontaneously report any adverse events that they experienced. The physicians routinely monitored laboratory samples from the patients for abnormalities in blood chemistry and hematology e.g. assessed the levels of inflammatory response mediators such as cytokines (TNF, IL-6), tryptase and complement. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects meeting the ACR 20 criteria on day 85.<br>
Storage of Test Material<br>
The CTLA4Ig and Ll04EA29YIg were supplied in single-use glass vials containing 200 mg/vial of CTLA4Ig or 100 mg/viai of LI04EA29YIg, respectively. Prior to infusion, the CTLA4ig and L104EA29YIg were diluted to a final concentration of 25 mg/mi with sterile water for injection (SWFI).<br>
Administraiion Protcoi<br>
All infusions were administered intravenously over 1 hour (Figures 1 through 17).   All subjects received at least one infusion of study medication.<br><br><br>
Group 1: 32 patients. CTLA4Ig or L104EA29Ylg matching placebo.<br>
Group 2: 26 patients; dosage 0.5 mg/kg of CTLA4Ig.<br>
&gt;      Group 3: 32 patients; dosage 2.0 mg/kg of CTLA4Ig.<br>
Group 4: 32 patients; dosage 10.0 mg/kg of CTLA4Ig.<br>
Group 5: 32 patients; dosage 0.5 mg/kg of H04EA29YIg.<br>
Group 6: 29 patients; dosage 2.0 mg/kg of L104EA29YIg.<br>
Group 7: 31 patients; dosage 10.0 mg/kg of LI04EA29YIg.<br>
Clinical Monitoring<br>
Patients were evaluated for baseline symptoms of disease activity prior to receiving any infusions. These baseline evaluations included; joint swelling, joint tenderness, inflammation, morning stiffness, disease activity evaluated by patient and physician as well as disability evaluated by Health Questionnaire Assessment (HAQ) (reported as a physical function score in Figure 1C), and pain (Figures 1A to ID). Additionally, the baseline evaluations included erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR), and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble IL-2 receptor (IL-2r) (Figures 1C and ID).<br>
The clinical response studies were based on the criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). A subject satisfied the ACR20 criterion if there was a 20 percent improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and 20 percent improvement in three of the five remaining symptoms measured, such as patient and physician global disease changes, pain. disability, and an acute phase reactant (Felson. D. T.. et al 1993 Arthritis and Rheumatism 36:729-740; Felson. D. T., et al., 1995 Arthritis and Rheumatism 38:1-9).<br><br>
Biomarkers<br>
Potential biomarkers of disease activity (rheumatoid factor, CRP, ESR, soluble IL-2R. soluble ICAM-1, soluble E-selectin, and MMP-3) were also assessed. Validated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods were used to determine the serum concentration of IL-2sRa, sICAM-1, sE-selectn and MMP-3. TNFa and IL-6 were assessed at infusion pre and 2 hours post, if necessary.<br>
IL-2sRa, sICAM-1, and sE-selectin were measured using commercially available coiorimetric EIA kits from R&amp;D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 312-20,000 pg/mL, 40-907 ng/mL and 10-206 ng/mL, respectively. The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged from 4.48-8.4%, 3.8-5.0% and 5.5-9.0% respectively. According to the kit manufacturer, normal serum values range from 676-2,132 pg/mL, respectively.<br>
MMP-3 was measured using a commercially available coiorimetric EIA kit from Amersham " Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 30-7,680 ng/mL. The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged from 6.3-10.6%o. According to the kit manufacturer, normal, serum values range from 28-99 ng/mL.<br>
IL-6 and TNFa were measured using commercially available chemiluminescent EIA kits from R&amp;D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 0.3-3.000 pg/mL and 0.7-7,000 pg/mL. respectively. The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged from 3.1-5.7% and 6.4-20.7%, respectively. According to the kit manufacturer, normal serum values range from 
<br><br>
Antibody testing<br>
Serum samples were obtained for assessment of drug-specific antibodies prior to dosing on day I, and approximately on days 15, 29, 57, 85 and 169. Due to high, preexisting titers directed to the immunoglobulin (Ig) portion of the molecule, specific antibody formation against CTLA4Ig and LEA29Y without Ig constant regions was also assessed.<br>
Ninety-six well Immulon II ELISA plates (Dynex, Chantiily, Virginia) were coated with CTLA4Ig, CTLA4Ig without the Ig constant regions, LEA29Y, or LEA29Y without the Ig constant regions at 2, 4, 2, or 1 u-g/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), respectively, and incubated overnight at 2-8°C.   The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked for 1 hour at 37°C with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).    The plates were then washed and serial dilutions of the test sera or quality control (QC) sera were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Sera was diluted threefold in PBS with 0.25% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 starting at a 1:10 dilution.    Plates were washed and an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human  kappa and  lambda  (Southern  Biotechnology Associates,  Inc.,  Birmingham, Alabama) antibody cocktail was added.    Following a 1-hour incubation at 37°C, the plates were washed and 1 mg/ml para-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer was added to each well.   After 30 minutes at 25°C, the reactions were stopped with 3N NaOH and the absorbance (dual wavelength: 405 nm and 550 nm) was recorded. Results were expressed as endpoint titer (EPT), defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that resulted in an absorbance reading fivefold greater than or equal to the mean plate-background   absorbance.      Plate   background   was   determined   as   the   absorbance measurement recorded in the absence of serum.   Values were considered positive for seroconversion if they were at least two serial dilutions (ninefold) or greater relative to predose EPT values.    Serum QC samples positive for either CTLA4lg- or LEA29Y-specific  antibodies  were  generated  from   immunized  monkeys.     An  aliquot  of the appropriate QC sample was assayed during each analytical run.   Analytical runs were accepted only when the QC samples were within the assay acceptance criteria.<br><br><br>
Results<br>
CTLA4lg and L104EA29YIg were generally well-tolerated at all dose-levels. Peri-infusional adverse events were similar across all dose groups, with the exception of headaches. Headache response of patients on day 85 increased dose-dependently 23%, 44%, and 53% in CTLA4Ig-treated patients, and 34%, 45%. and 61% in L104EA29YIg-treated patients, at 0.5, 2.0, and 10.0 mg/kg respectively. in contrast, 31% of the patients administered placebos experienced headaches.<br>
The percent of patients that discontinued from the clinical study due to arthritis flares and other adverse events is summarized in Figure 2. A much higher percentage of patients on placebo discontinued treatment due to arthritis flare. The CTLA4Ig treated patients discontinued treatment less with increasing doses. Very few patients treated with L104EA29YIg discontinued treatment. These results indicate a good inverse dose-dependent response for CTLA4Ig, and a stronger therapeutic response with L104EA29YIg therapy.<br>
The ACR-20, -50, and -70 responses of patients treated with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo at day 85 are summarized in Figure 3A. Similarly, Figures 3B and C describe the ACR-20 responses with 95% confidence limits. The responses appear to be dose-dependent with a clear significant response at 10 mg/kg per body weight of the patient.<br>
The percent of patients having reduced swollen and tender joint counts compared to the patients having no response to treatment with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo, is shown in Figures 4A and B. The therapeutic responses appear to be dose-dependent. A larger percentage of patients show improvement of 20, 50. 70. and even 100% in the 2 and 10 mg/kg groups for both products.<br>
The percent of patients having reduced pain, disease activity evaluated by patient and physician mean score units with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo, is shown in Figures 5A, B. C. and D.   The therapeutic responses, as monitored by the Likert scale.<br><br><br>
appear to be dose-dependent in favor of the active treatment groups as compared to placebo on day 85. The Likert scale is a validated verbal rating scale using adjectives to rank the symptoms (The American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Core Set of Disease Activity Measures for Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials: Arthritis and Rheumatism. June 1993. 36(6):729-740).<br>
The patient and physician assessments of the.case activity change from the baseline by at least 2 units, resulting from treatment with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo, are shown in Figures 6A and B. The responses appear to be dose-dependent with more marked improvement for the hzgher doses of active drugs.<br>
The percent reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients treated with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo, is shown in Figures 7A and B. The responses appear to be dose-dependent with a clear decrease for the 2 and 10 mg/kg active treatment groups. In addition, Figure 7B showed that the difference is quite significant compared to placebo with 95% confidence intervals. Figure 7C shows the changes in serum level changes from baseline at day 85.<br>
The amount of serum soluble IL-2 receptor in patients treated with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg. or placebo, is shown in Figure 8. The reduction in soluble IL-2 receptor levels appears to be dose-dependent.<br>
The amount of serum soluble ICAM-1 and soluble E-selectin in patients treated with CTLA4Ig, LI04EA29YIg, or placebo, is shown in Figure 33. The reduction in soluble ICAM-I and soluble E-selectin levels appears to be dose-dependent.<br>
The median and mean tender joint counts in patients treated with CTLA4Ig or placebo over time are shown in Figures 9A and B. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in tender joints) appears to be more important in the 2 and 10 mg/kg treated groups, than in the placebo or 0.5 mg/kg groups.<br><br><br>
The median and mean swollen joint counts in patients treated with CTLA4Ig or placebo over time are shown in Figures 10A and B.   The change from baseline (e.g.. reduction in swollen joints) appears to be more important in the 2 and 10 mg/kg treated groups than placebo or 0.5 mg/kg groups. 5<br>
The mean pain assessment scores over time in patients treated with CTLA4Ig or placebo are shown in Figure 11. The change from baselline (e.g., reduction in pain) appears to be more important in the 2 and 10 mg/kg treated groups than placebo or 0.5 mg/kg groups.<br>
) The mean disease activity assessment scores assessed by patient or physician in patients treated with CTLA4Ig or placebo over time are shown in Figures 12A and B. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in disease activity) appears to be more important in the 2 and 10 mg/kg treated groups than placebo or 0.5 mg/kg groups.<br>
The median and mean tender joint counts in patients treated with L104EA29YIg (denoted as LEA in the figures) or placebo over time are shown in Figures 13A and B. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in tender joints) appears to be dose-dependent.<br>
The median and mean swollen joint counts in patients treated with L104EA29YIg (denoted as LEA in the figures) or placebo over time are shown in Figures 14A and B. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in swollen joints) appears to be more important in the 2 and 10 mg/kg treated groups than placebo or 0.5 mg/kg groups.<br>
The mean pain assessment scores in patients treated with L104EA29YIg (denoted as LEA in the figures) or placebo over time are shown in Figure 15. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in pain) appears to be dose-dependent.<br>
The mean disease activity assessment scores evaluated by patient or physician in patients treated with L104EA29YIg (denoted as LEA in the figures) or placebo over time are shown in Figures 16A and B. The change from baseline (e.g., reduction in disease activity) appears to be dose-dependent.<br><br>
The percent improvement of physical disability assessed by HAQ at day 85 for patients treated with CTLA4Ig, L104EA29YIg, or placebo are shown in Figure 17 (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ); Fries, J. F., et al., 1982 J. of Rheumatology 9:789-793). There is a clear dose dependent improvement with this parameter.<br>
The changes from baseline for soluble IL-2r and C .eactive protein levels were dose-dependent in both treatment groups. After treatment, soluble IL-2r levels were -2%, -10%, and -22% for CTLA4Ig and -4%, -18%, and -32% for L104EA29YIg at 0.5, 2.0. and 10.0 mg/kg respectively, compared to +3% for the placebo. C-reactive protein levels were +12%. -15%, and -32% for CTLA4Ig and +47%, -33%, and -47% for L104EA29YIg at 0.5, 2.0. and 10.0 mg/kg respectively, compared to +20% for the placebo (Figure 7A).<br>
No clinically remarkable findings with respect to routine hematology testing, chemistry laboratory testing with the exception of slight suppressions in IgA and IgG levels at the higher doses of both drugs, physical findings, or vital signs assessments were observed. Notably, neither medication induced drug-specific antibodies.<br>
Example 4<br>
The following examples describe phase II clinical studies of human patients that will be administered L104EA29YIg, to reduce or prevent structural damage, including bone or joint erosion using validated radiographic scales. This improvement in reducing or preventing structural damage is parallel to the clinical improvement measured by the clinical parameters.<br>
The status of the bone structure is monitored in some of the human patients prior to treatment with CTLA4Ig or Ll04EA29YIg. These patients are administered between 0.5 and 20 mg/"kg of CTLA4Ig or LI04EA29YIg chronically even" two to twelve weeks (alone or in combination with other agents) to maintain their therapeutic improvement<br><br><br>
over time. Radiographs of patients hands and feet are taken at predefined intervals: 6 months, and then yearly, as recommended by the FDA guidelines. These patients are monitored in long-term extension after 6 and 12 months to determine if treatment with CTLA4Ig or L104EA29YIg reduces the progression of bone deterioration, and then yearly. The patients are monitored by radiographic methods, including X-ray and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), according to standard practice in the an (Larsen. A. K. and M. Eek 1977 Acta. Radiol. Diag. 18:481-491; Shaip, J. T., et al., 1985 Arthritis and Rheumatism 28:1326-1335). The results of the radiographic data are evaluated for prevention of structural damage, including slowing the progression of bone erosion and cartilage damage, with joint space narrowing and/or prevention of new erosions.<br><br>
