FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of an intermediate for The preparation of Donepezil hydrochloride.  The intermediate_is l-benzyl-[(5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanon)-2-ylidenyl]methyl piperidine has the formula I given below<br><br>
Donepezil hydrochloride  which is 1 -benzyl-4-(5,6-dimethoxy indan-1 -on-2-yl)-methyl piperidine Hydrochloride has the formula II given below<br><br>
is an anti Alzheimer's agent<br>
The key intermediate used in the preparation of Donepezil hydrochloride, is l-benzyl-4-[(5,6-<br>
dimethoxy-l-indanon)-2"ylidenyl] methyl piperidine which has the formula (I)<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION;<br>
Donepezil HCl is a memory enhancer drug useful in time treatment of Alzheimer's disease introduced by Japanese Pharmaceutical Company 'Eisai'. Its preparation was described in the patents EP 296560/ US 4895841 by tile reaction of 5,6-dimetiioxy indamine’s with l-benzyl-4-formyl piperidine in the presence of a strong base such as Lithium diisopropylamide followed by reduction of double bond. The reaction is shown in Scheme I<br><br>
The reaction was conducted in an argon atmosphere, and in the presence of strong base such as Lithium diisopropylamide.<br><br>
Diisopropylamine was added to anhydrous THF solvent, followed by addition of 1.6M solution of n-Butyl Lithium in n-Hexane at 0°C, the mixture was taken cooled to -78°C and the solution of 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone (formula A) in anhydrous THF and hexamethylphosphoric amide were added there to. The mixture was stirred for 15 min at -78°C and a solution of l-Benzyl-4-piperidinecarboxaldehyde (Formula B) in THF was added. Reaction mixture was slowly raised to room temperature, stirred for 2 hrs. 1% Ammonium chloride solution was added and extracted in ethyl acetate. Organic layer was washed with a saturated saline solution, dried on magnesium sulphate, and concentrated in vacuum. The resulting residue was purified by making use of a silica gel column. (Methylene chloride: Metiianol=500:l-100:l)<br>
The elute was concentrated in vacuum, and HCL salt of formula-I was prepared by using hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above said process (Shown in Scheme-I) are in the preparation of the Intermediate compound of formula-I. They are:<br>
1.	Raw materials like n-Butyl lithium, Diisopropylamine, hexamethylene phosphoric amide are relatively expensive and toxic.<br>
2.	Reaction needs anhydrous conditions, because the reagent n-Butyl lithium is highly sensitive to moisture and will decompose on exposure to moisture. So ties reaction will not proceed further.<br>
3.	The reaction needs very low temperatures of the order of -78°C which is not possible for plant scale operations.<br>
4.	Needs column chromatography for purification which is time consuming and limits the batch size.<br>
5.	Only moderate yields of intermediate of formula-I are the order of about 60% are realized.<br>
JP 11171,861 describes a process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I by using sodium ethoxide as base in Tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent<br><br>
JP 11171861 describes the process for condensation of 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone of formula A and l-benzyl-4-piperidine carboxaldehyde formula B to yield the product formula-I in the presence of sodium metiioxide in motional in THF solvent at 17-21°C.<br>
Drawbacks of the process:<br>
i)        Process involved ties use of sodium metiioxide, which is moisture sensitive reagent.<br>
ii)       The solvent THF is relatively expensive and moisture sensitive.<br>
iii)      Such moisture sensitive, reagents and solvents need anhydrous conditions other wise<br>
reaction does not proceed snootily and tierce is possibility of byproduct formation<br>
resulting in low yields of the desired product.<br>
Necessity of removing of above draw backs<br>
1.	Raw materials used in tike existing processes like n-Butyllithiimi, diisopropylamide, Hexamethylphosphoric amide and sodium ethoxide are relatively, expensive toxic, and moisture sensitive. Economic feasibility of these processes is questionable.<br>
2.	Needs anhydrous conditions otiierwise reaction will not proceed.<br>
3.	The reaction required low temperature (-78°C) which is not possible for plant scale operations<br>
4.	Column chromatography for purification is time consuming and limits batch size.<br>

in the presence of aqueous alkali metal carbonate as a base in an alcoholic or equinoxes alcohol solvents at reflux temperature, end product is recovering by cooling time reaction mass to room temperature, diluting with water. Filtering the product, and crystallizing in methanol.<br>
The yield of the compound of the formula I according to the process of the present invention is found to be 75-80%<br>
The condensation reaction may be optionally conducted in the presence of phase transfer catalyst like customary ammonium salts to improve the yields fur flier (85-90%).<br>
The   intermediate   of   formula-I,   [1 -benzyl-4-[(5,6-dimethoxy-1 -emanon)-2-yUdenyl]methyl piperidine can be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to obtain the compound of ties formula II The process of the present invention is shown in Scheme 2.<br>
The Novelty of the process is,<br>
a)	Avoids toxic chemicals and relatively expensive materials<br>
b)	Avoids the anhydrous conditions and low temperatures like -78° C and the process involves<br>
aqueous alcoholic media and reflux temperature.<br>
c)	Involves the Simple readily available, non-toxic, less expensive raw materials.<br><br>
d) Avoids tie column chromatographic purification, which is time consuming and limits the batch size.<br><br>
Typically a mixture of 5,6-dimethoxyindanone of the formula A is condensed with l-benzyl-4-piperidine carboxaldehyde of formula B in the presence of potassium carbonate and methanol at reflux temperature for 4 hours to get tie intermediate benzylidene derivative of the formula (I) in 75% yield. The yields are fortifier improved to 85% when the reaction is optionally conducted in presence of phase transfer catalyst like tetrabutylammonium bromide.<br>
