				<td>The present invention relates to Diastereoselective Reductive Amination Process<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention describes a reductive amination process whereby<br>
perfluorinated ketones or ketals are combined with cc-aminoesters under basic conditions<br>
to form imine metal carboxylates. Diastereoselective reductions of the imine metal<br>
carboxylates enable access to two diastereomers, depending on the reducing conditions.<br>
These diastereomers can be further substituted to provide selective cathepsin K inhibitors<br>
which can be used in the treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.<br>
The art involved imines of amino esters, where as the instant invention<br>
involves imines of carboxylic acid salts. In addition, the previously reported substrates do<br>
not contain fluorinated imine substituents. The selectivities obtained under the conditions<br>
described herein are much higher than those presented in the art.<br>
This invention solves two problems. What is needed in the art is a process<br>
for the formation of imines from ketones or ketals bearing fluorines in the alpha position.<br>
This is a difficult transformation due to the stability of an initially formed hemi aminal<br>
intermediate which is difficult to dehydrate to give the imine. This problem had<br>
previously been solved by using strongly acidic solutions and high temperatures, which<br>
generally leads to decomposition of the starting materials and low yields of the required<br>
imine. The process of this invention uses basic conditions for the imine formation and has<br>
a number of advantages, including: the imines are formed under much milder conditions<br>
(between 20 and 50°C and the presence of MeO"M+ or M+<br>
efficient recovery (-90%); a wider range of substrates are tolerated by these conditions;<br>
and the imine product is a stable carboxylic acid salt which upon reduction can give a<br>
corresponding substituted amino acid product. This avoids a potentially problematic ester<br>
hydrolysis step which can lead to epimerization of the amino acid stereocenter. Also, by<br>
the careful choice of reducing conditions, the two amino acid diastereoisomers can be<br>
accessed from the same imine metal carboxylate.<br>
