FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to certain pyrazole carboxylic acid derivatives, and pharmaccutically acceptable salts thereof, which exhibit useful pharmacological properties, for example as agonists for the receptor RUP25. Also provided by the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention, and methods of using the compounds and compositions of the invention in the treatment of metabolic-related disorders, including dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, Syndrome-X and the like. In addition, the present invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions in combination with other active agents, for example, those agents belonging to the class of a-glucosidase inhibitors, aldosc reductase inhibitors, biguanides, HMG-CoA rcductase inhibitors, squalene synthesis inhibitors, fibrates, LDL catabolism enhancers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, insulin secretion enhancers, thiazolidinedione and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Compounds of the invention as Antilipolytic Agents<br>
Atherosclerosis and stroke are the numbers one and number three leading causes of death of both men and women in the United States. Type 2 diabetes is a public health problem that is serious, widespread and increasing  Elevated levels of low density lipoprotcin (LDL) cholesterol or low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are, independently, risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular pathologies. In addition, high levels of plasma free fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. One strategy for decreasing LDL-cholesterol, increasing HDL-cholesterol, and decreasing plasma free fatty acids is to inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue. This approach involves regulation of hormone sensitive lipase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Lipolytic agents increase cellular levels of c AMP, which leads to activation of hormone sensitive lipase within adipocytes. Agents that lower intracellular cAMP levels, by contrast, would be antilipolytic.<br>
It is also worth noting in passing that an increase in cellular levels of cAMP down-regulates the secretion of adiponecrin from adipocytes [Delporte, ML et al. Biochem J (2002) July], Reduced levels of plasma adiponectin have been associated with metabolic-related disorders, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [Matsuda, M et al J Biol Chem (2002) July and reviewed therein].<br>
Nicotinic acid (niacin, pyndine-3-carboxylic acidVis a water-soluble vitamin required by the human body for health,.growth and reproduction; a part of the Vitamin B complex. Nicotinic<br><br>
2<br>
acid is also one of the oldest used drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is a valuable drug in that it favorably affects virtually all of the lipid parameters listed above [Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, editors Harmon JG and Limbird LE, Chapter 36, Mahley RW and Bersot TP (2001) pages 971-1002]. The benefits of nicotinic acid in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been documented in six major clinical trials [Guyton JR (1998) Am J Cardiol 82:18U-23U]. Nicotinic acid and related derivatives, such as, acipimox have recently been discussed [Lorenzen, A et al (2001) Molecular Pharmacology 59:349-357].<br>
Nicotinic acid inhibits the production and release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, likely via an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels, and a concomitant decrease in hormone sensitive lipase activity. Agonists that down-regulate hormone sensitive lipase activity leading to a decrease in plasma free fatty acid levels are likely to have therapeutic value. The consequence of decreasing plasma free fatty acids is two-fold. First, it will ultimately lower LDL-cholesterol and raise HDL-choIesterol levels, independent risk factors, thereby reducing the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular incidence subsequent to atheroma formation. Second, it will provide an increase in insulin sensitivity in individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the use ofnicotinic acid as a therapeutic is partially limited by a number of associated, adverse side-effects. These include flushing, free fatty acid rebound, and liver toxicity.<br>
The rational development of novel, nicotinic acid receptor agonists that have fewer side-effects will be valuable, but to date this has been hindered by the inability to molecularly identify the nicotinic acid receptor. Furthermore, other receptors of the same'class may exist on the surface of adipocytes and similarly decrease hormone sensitive lipase activity through a reduction in the level of intracellular cAMP but without the elicitation of adverse effects such as flushing, thereby representing promising novel therapeutic targets. Recent work suggests that nicotinic acid probably acts through a specific GPCR [Lorenzen A, et al. (2001) Molecular Pharmacology 59:349-357 and reviewed therein].<br>

DEFINITIONS:<br>
The scientific literature has adopted a number of terms, for consistency and clarity, the following definitions will be used throughout this patent document.<br>
AGONISTS shall mean moieties that interact and activate the receptor, such as the RUP25 receptor and initiates a physiological or pharmacological response characlenshc of that receptor. For example, when moieties activate the intracellular response upon binding to the receptor, or enhance GTP binding to membranes.<br>
AMINO ACID ABBREVIATIONS used herein are set out in TABLE 1:<br><br>
The term ANTAGONISTS is intended to mean moieties that competitively bind to the receptor at the same site as agonists (for example, the endogenous ligand), but which do not activate the intraccHular response initiated by the active form of the receptor, and can thereby inhibit the intracellular responses by agonists or partial agonists. Antagonists do not diminish the baseline intraceUular response in the absence of an agonist or partial agonist.<br><br>

Synthetic Methods of Pyrazoles<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be readily prepared according to a variety of synthetic regimes, all of which would be familiar to one skilled in the art. The chemical and patent literature quotes numerous procedures for the synthesis of pyrazole carboxylic acids and esters. Some of these articles include: Ashton and co-workers,/ Med. Chem. 1993,36,3595-3605; Seki and co-workers, Chem. Pharm. Bull-, 1984,52, 1568; and Wiley and Hcxncr, Org. SynCollIV, 1963, 351.<br><br>
30<br>
In the illustrated syntheses outlined below, the labeled substituents have the same identifications as set out in the definitions of the compound described above for Formula (I). The methods described below may be used for the preparation of compounds of the invention.<br>
One method that may be used to prepare compounds of Formula (I) utilizes intermediates of Formula (A) as illustrated in Reaction Scheme (1) below;<br><br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating the 2,4-dikcto ester or acid (R = alkyl or H respectively, (A)] with hydrazine (B) under various conditions. For example, the solvent may optionally be present or absent. In the instance that the solvent is absent then the hydrazine (B) serves both as a reactant and as the solvent. Typically, under these conditions hydrazine would be present in molar excess. In the instance when the solvent is present, the solvent may be a polar solvent and is generally a C,-C6 alcohol. Some typical solvents may be selected from, but not limited to, the group consisting of methanol, cthanol, butanol, pcntanol, hexanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 1 -propanol and 2-propanol. In some instances it may be beneficial to include the presence of an acid. Some representative examples of acids may be selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction temperature generally ranges from about 20°C to about ,160°C, and for convenience, the reaction temperature is typically the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
The 2,4-diketo esters or acids (A) may be readily available or may be obtained by methods known in the art, Seki and co-workers, Chem. Pkarm. Bull., 1984, 32,1568. Likewise, the hydrazines of Formula (B) may be readily available from commercial sources or may be obtained by methods known in the art.<br>
One particular feature of 2,4-diketo esters or acids (A) is that a diverse number of Rj groups may be introduced by a variety of methods known in the art, such as, alkylation, as shown in Reaction Scheme (2) below:<br><br><br>
Jl<br>
The alkylation step as shown in Reaction Scheme (2) is similar to and in some instances identical to that described in the preparation of intermediate (F), infra.<br>
Utilizing a similar starting maternal as in Reaction Scheme (1) an alternative method may be used to prepare compounds of Formula (I) as illustrated in Reaction Scheme (3) below:<br><br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating 2,4-diketo ester or acid (C), in some embodiments the ester, with an alkoxyaminc of Formula (D) where R|0 is Q-Cg alkyi, leading to 2-{methoxyimino) intermediate of Formula (E). Typically, the alkoxyamine is methoxyamine (i.e., O-methyl hydroxylamine) wherein R|0 is methyl. This step is typically conducted in the presence of a drying agent to concomitantly remove the water formed during the process; examples of a drying agent that may be used include molecular sieves, magnesium sulfate and the like. In the subsequent step, the intermediate of Formula (E) may be functionalized with R2 utilizing methods known in the art. One example may use R:-LG, wherein LG is a leaving group, such as, iodo, bromo, mcsylate and the like, in the presence of a base and a polar solvent. Typical bases may be selected from, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, LDA, sodium methoxide, sodium cthoxide and the like; and the polar solvent may be dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, THF and the like. It is understood that this step is optional since in some embodiments of the invention R: is H. In this context, as depicted in Reaction Scheme (3), intermediate (E) may be converted to a compound of Formula (I) wherein R2 is H using hydrazine (B). This step may be performed under heating conditions in an alcoholic solvent as described above in Reaction Scheme (1). Optionally, an acid may be present, such as HCl Similarly, in the example where R: is not H, intermediate (F) may be treated with hydrazine (B)<br><br>
32<br>
in a manner as described above to provide compounds of Formula (I) where R? is a group other than H.<br>
It is understood that in reference to Reaction Scheme (3), a compound of Formula (C) may be functionalized with R3 as described above pnor to treating with alkoxyamine (D) to give the same intermediate (F). Absent any chemical reason that would be known in the art, the order of the steps may be changed and may be more a matter of convenience than necessity [i.e., (C) to (E)to(F);or(C)to(A)to(K)].<br>
In addition, compounds of the invention may be prepared using transition metal carbene complexes as illustrated in Reaction Scheme (4) below:<br>
Various methods may be used in the preparation of carbene complexes, such as, those methods reviewed by Dotz and co-workers, Transition Metal Carbeen Complexes, VCH, Dcerfield Beach FL, 1983 and by Brown, Prog. Inorg Chem. 1980,27, 1. The intermediate (G), where M can be chromium or tungsten, may be converted to a pyrazole carbene complex (H) by treatment with diazomethane or a derivative of diazomethane, such as<br>
tnmethylsilyldiazomethane, and the like. Typically, intermediate (H) need not be isolated but may be directly oxidized to pyrazolcs of Formula (I). Acceptable oxidants include, for example, eerie ammonium nitrate (i.e., CAN), and the like. One advantage of this method is that the cycloaddition step is typically highly rcgioselective. Generally, this particular method may be most appropriate for when Rj is H.<br>
In addition, compounds of the invention may be prepared by another method through the use of trihaloacetyl enol ethers as shown in Reaction Scheme (5) below;<br><br>
The enol ethers (J) are available or may be prepared by various methods known in the art. Intermediate (K) may be prepared by treating enol etheT (J) with an acetylaring agent under basic conditions at reduced temperatures. A variety of acetylaring agents may be utilized, such<br><br>
35<br>
as, trichloroacetyl chloride, trichloroacetic anhydride, tnfluoroacetyl chlonde, trifluoroacetic anhydride, and the like. Typically, the solvent is pyndine and the reaction temperature is at 25°C or below; however, typically is 0°C or below. The trihatoacetyl cnol ether (K) may be treated with hydrazine (B) in a polar solvent and heated to reflux to give compound of Formula (I). Typically, the polar solvent is a C|-Co alcohol as described above.<br>
Certain examples of Formula (I) when Ri is H may be N-alkylated by a variety of methods known in art. Alkylating reagents may be of the general formula R(-LG where R| and LG have the meaning as described herein supra. For example, methylation may be realized using reagents such as dimethylsulfate, methyl iodide, and the like. Other R, groups may be used through the use of similar reagents, such as ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, propyl iodide, isopropyl bromide, trifluoromethyl iodide, 2,2,2-triftuorocthyM -iodide, and the like. Generally a base is used to facilitate the N-alkylation.<br>
Esters of the compounds shown, supra, wherein R = alkyl, may be readily converted to the corresponding carboxyhc acids of Formula (I), (i.e., in example cited above R = H) by methods known in the art, such as alkaline hydrolysis using LiOH, NaOH, K.OH, and the like. Another method for the conversion of an ester to a carboxylic acid of Formula (I) is through the use of acid hydrolysis, such as aqueous HC1 and the like. Generally, the solvent is an aqueous mixture with a polar solvent as described above.<br>
The present invention also encompasses diastcreomers as well as optical isomcrs, e.g. mixtures of cnantiomers including racC1-4ic mixtures, as well as individual enantiomcrs and diastereomers, which arise as a consequence of structural asymmetry in certain compounds of the present invention. Separation of the individual isomers or selective synthesis of the individual isomers is accomplished by application of various methods which are well known to practitioners in the art.<br>

Compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt and/or a solvate and/or a hydrate or physiologically functional derivative thereof can b*e used as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions. The term "active ingredient" is defined in the context of a "pharmaceutical composition" and shall mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an "inactive ingredient" which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit. An example of "active ingredient" is a compound of the present invention, another example includes an agent used in combination therapy, such as a sulfonylurea, meglitinidc, biguanide, and like agents as discussed herein.<br>
Formulations may be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the active compounds with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions, and then, it necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.<br>
Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants, and disintegrants may be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions, and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations may be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle<br><br>
44<br>
before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives, and flavorings and colorants may be added to the liquid preparations. Parcnteral dosage forms may be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and scaling an appropriate vial or ampoule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.<br>
A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaccutically-acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, (Editors: Gennaro, A. R., et al.).<br>
While it is possible that, for use in the treatment of a metabolic-related disorder, compounds of the invention may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however, to administer the compounds or active ingredients as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable carrier.<br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical!y acceptable salt or derivative thereof together with a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable carriers thereof. The carriers) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof<br>
"Pharmaceutical compositions" or "Formulations" include tKose compositions suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation or by a transderma) patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdcrmal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.<br>
The compounds of the invention, together with a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or diluent, may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical<br><br>
45<br>
compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition, in some embodiments, is made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient, for example, a compound disclosed herein. Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or a suspension, with conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, com starch or potato starch; with binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, com starch or gelatins; with disintegrators such as com starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable pharmaccutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide limits, and as is customary and is known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated, on the condition of the individual, on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the present invention include, but not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 to about 2500 mg, about 0.001 to about 1000 mg, about 0.001 to about 500 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 250 mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg, and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate from the individual's physician or care-giver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the dosage forms may comprise as the active component, cither a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention; or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or hydrate thereof.<br>
The amount of active ingredient, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the individual and will ultimately b€ at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human. Typically, animal models include, but are not limited to, the rodents diabetes models as described in Example 1, infra, or the mouse artherosclerosis model as described in Example 2, infra. Other animal models are<br><br>
4f.<br>
known in the art, for example, those reported by Reed and Scribncr in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, 1, 1999, 75-86. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal in the respective model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, for example, a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include, but not limited to, the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the individual, the seventy of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors as cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, may be used in the methods of this invention.<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, the selection of a suitable pharmaceuticaUy acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizcrs, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.<br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size.<br>
The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this ranse are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate,<br><br>
47<br>
magnesium stcarate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as earner providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycendes or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylenc glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water; Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br><br>
4S<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymcthyIcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.<br>
Also included arc solid form preparations which arc intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispcrsants, thickeners, solubilizmg agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.<br>
Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and moulhwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions arc applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the individual administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the Formula (1) or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metercd inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the Formula (I) as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well-known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the present invention in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavariability, solubilizers, dispersants<br><br>
49<br>
and others, and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFC's, such as, dichiorodifluoromethane, tnchlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin  The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metercd valve<br>
In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the aC1-4e ingredient may be employed.<br>
Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvmylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder earner will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations arc, in some embodiments, in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of ihe active component, The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packctcd tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, tablets or capsules arc used for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may optionally exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, acetic, benzenesulfonic, bcnzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, formic, fumanc, gluconic, glutamic, hippunc, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, lsethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitnc, oxalic, pamoic, pantothemc, phosphoric, succinic, sulfinc, tartanc, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like, such as those pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66,2 (1977); incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid, and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent. The compounds of this invention may form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known to the skilled artisan.<br><br>
50<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be converted to "pro-drugs." The term "pro-drugs" refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In one general aspect, the "pro-drug" approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and in Biorcversiblc Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pcrgamon Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
It is noted that when the RUP25 receptor modulators are utilized as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition, these arc not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care suggest that consideration be given for the use of active agents, such as RUP25 receptor modulators, for the treatment of metabolic-related disorders in domestic animals (e.g., cats and dogs), and RUP25 receptor modulators in other domestic animals where no disease or disorder is evident (e.g., food-oriented animals such as cows, chickens, fish, etc.). Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings.<br>

OTHER UTILITIES<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to radio-labeled compounds of Formula (I) that would be useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the RUP25 receptor in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying RUP25 receptor ligands by inhibition binding of a radio-labeled compound. It is a further object of this invention to develop novel RUP25 receptor assays of which comprise such radio-labeled compounds.<br>
The present invention embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula (1) and any subgenera herein, such as but not limited to, Formula (la) through Formula (Ulo). An "isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compounds are those which are identical to compounds disclosed herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms arc replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to !H (also written as D for deuterium), JH (also written as T for tritium), llC, 1JCf MC, lJN, I5N, ISO, "0, I8O, l8F, 3SS, 36C1, MBr, 7SBr, 76Br, nBr, '"i, l24I, IZSI and mI. The radionuchde that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro RUP25 receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, l4C, KBr, '"I, I3II, 3SS or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications nC, IBF, '"i, li3I, I24I, 1JII, 75Br, 76Br or "Br will generally be most useful.<br>
It is understood that a "radio-labeled " or "labeled compound" is a compound of Formula (I) that has incorporated at least one radionuclide; in some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, UC, l25I, "S and nBr. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide 3H and/or 4C<br><br>
59<br>
isotopes arc useful in these studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.c, :H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances,   sotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes supra and Examples infra, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Other synthetic methods that arc useful arc discussed infra. Moreover, it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the more scarce radio-isotope or nonradio-acnvc isotope<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. These synthetic methods, for example,1 incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules, are as follows:<br>
A. Catalytic Reduction with Tntium Gas - This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors.<br>
B- Reduction with Sodium Borohydnde (*H] - This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactoncs, esters, and the like.<br>
C.	Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydndc (SH ] - This procedure offers products at<br>
almost theoretical specific activities   It also requires precursors containing reducible functional<br>
groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactoncs, esters, and the like.<br>
D.	Tntium Gas Exposure Labeling - This procedure involves exposing precursors<br>
containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst.<br>
E.	N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [5H] - This procedure is usually employed to<br>
prepare O-methyl or N-methyl (JH) products by treating appropriate precursors with high<br>
specific activity methyl iodide (JH). This method in general allows for higher specific activity,<br>
such as for example, about 70-90 Ci/mmol.<br>
Synthetic meuiods for incorporating activity levels of l2iI into target molecules include:<br>
A.	Sandmcyer and like reactions - This procedure transforms an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
amine into a diazonium salt, such as a tetrafluoroborate salt, and subsequently to mI labeled<br>
compound using Na'"l. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, D.-G. and co-workers in<br>
J. Org. Chem. 2002. 67, 943-948<br>
B.	Ortho i;sIodination of phenols - This procedure allows for the incorporation of ui\ at<br>
the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in J. Labeled Compd<br>
Radiooharm. 1999.42.S264-S266.<br><br>
60<br>
C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with mI - This method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction [i.e. Pd(Ph3P)4] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-alkyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CHj)3SnSn(CH3)3]. A represented procedure was reported by Bas, M.-D. and co-workers in J. Labeled Compd Radiopharm. 2001,44, S280-S282.<br>
A radio-labeled RUP25 receptor compound of Formula (I) can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the "radio-labeled compound of Formula (I)" to the RUP25 receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the "radio-labeled compound of Formula (J)" for the binding to the RUP25 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity.<br>
The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the RUP2S receptor. In one embodiment the labeled compound has an ICS0 less than about 500 uM, in another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICjo less than about 100 uM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an IC1-4 less than about 10 uM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an 1CSO less than about 1 uJvl, and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an ICW less than about 0.1 |iM.<br>

As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention need not be performed any particular number of times or in any particular sequence. Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples thereof, which are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be limiting.<br>

RODENT DIABETES MODELS<br>
Rodent models of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance have been developed. Genetic models such asdb/db and ob/ob[see Diabetes (1982) 31:1-6] in mice and fa/fa in zuckcr rats have been developed for understanding the pathophysiology of disease<br><br>
61<br>
and for testing candidate therapeutic compounds [Diabetes (1983) 32:830-838; Annu Rep Sankyo Res Lab (1994) 46:1-57], The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinC1-4ic and insulin resistant [J Gin Invest (1990) 85:962-967], whereas heterozygotcs are lean and normoglycemic. In the db/db model, mice progressively develop insulinopcnia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type 2 diabetes when sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. Since this model resembles that of human type 2 diabetes, the compounds of the present invention are tested for activities including, but not limited to, lowering of plasma glucose and triglyccndes. Zucker (fa/fa) rats are severely obese, hyperinsulinemic, and insulin resistant {Coleman, Diabetes (1982) 31:1; H Shafrir in Diabetes Mellitus, H Rifkin and D Porte, Jr, Eds [Elsevier Science Publishing Co, New York, ed. 4, (1990), pp. 299-340]}, and the fa/fa mutation may be the rat equivalent of the murine db mutation [Fnedman ct al, Cell (1992) 69:217-220; Truett ct al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1991) 88:7806]. Tubby (tub/tub) mice are characterized by obesity, moderate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia without significant hyperglycC1-4ia [Coleman ct al, Heredity (1990)81:424].<br>
The present invention encompasses the use of compounds of the invention for reducing the insulin resistance and hypcrglycC1-4ia in any or all of the above rodent diabetes models, in humans with type 2 diabetes or other preferred metabolic-related disorders or disorders of lipid metabolism described previously, or in models based on other mammals. Plasma glucose and insulin levels will be tested, as well as other factors including, but not limited to, plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides.

Prior to treatment, blood is collected from the tail vein of each animal and blood glucose concentrations are determined using One Touch Basic Glucose Monitor System (Lifescan). Mice that have plasma glucose levels between 250 to 500 mg/dl are used. Each treatment group consists of seven mice that are distributed so that the mean glucose levels are equivalent in each group at the start of the study, db/db mice are dosed by micro-osmotic pumps, inserted using isoflurane anesthesia, to provide compounds of the invention, saline, or an irrelevant compound to the mice subcutaneously (s.c). Blood is sampled from the tail vein at intervals thereafter and analyzed for blood glucose concentrations.

A modified [Flash Plate™ Adenylyl Cyclase kit (New England Nuclear; Cat. No. SMP004A) was utilized for direct identification of candidate compounds as agonists to hRUP25 (Seq. Id. Nos. 1 &amp; 2) in accordance with the following protocol:<br>
CHO cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding hRUP25 and cultured under condition permissive for cell surface expression of the encoded hRUP25 receptor were harvested from flasks via non-enzymatic means. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in the manufacturer's Assay Buffer. Live cells were counted using a hemacytometcr and Trypan blue exclusion, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 2xlO6 cells/ml. cAMP standards and Detection Buffer (comprising 2 uCi of tracer [l2iI]-cAMP (100 u.1) to 11 ml Detection Buffer) were prepared and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Candidate compounds identified as per above (if frozen, thawed at room temperature) were added to their respective wells (preferably wells of a 96-well plate) at increasing concentrations (3ji1/well; 12uM final assay concentration). To these wells, 100,000 cells in 50ul of Assay Buffer were added and the mixture was then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, with gentle shaking. Following the incubation, lOOul of Detection Buffer was added to each well, followed by incubation for 2-24 hours.
