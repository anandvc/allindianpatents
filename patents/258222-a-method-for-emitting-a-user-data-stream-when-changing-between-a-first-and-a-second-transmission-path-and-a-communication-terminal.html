Description<br>
Method for outputting a useful data stream and communications<br>
terminal for receiving and for outputting a useful data stream<br>
The invention relates to a method for outputting a useful data<br>
stream at the changeover between a first transmission path and<br>
a second transmission path according to the preamble of patent<br>
claim 1, and to a communications terminal for receiving and for<br>
outputting a useful data stream according to the preamble of<br>
patent claim 10.<br>
For mobile communication, communications terminals which are<br>
connected to a line-bound communication network by means of a<br>
radio link are frequently used. Examples of such arrangements<br>
are the known mobile radio networks, for example the GSM<br>
network, private telephone networks (DECT arrangements), WLAN<br>
arrangements etc. All these arrangements have in common the<br>
fact that bidirectional data streams in which useful data<br>
(audio data, video data etc.) is transmitted are used for the<br>
communication between one or more base stations (access point)<br>
and the mobile communications terminals (mobile telephones,<br>
cordless telephones, PDAs, multimedia PCs etc.).<br>
In many cases it is not possible to cover a desired geographic<br>
area completely by means of a single base station (access<br>
point). For this reason, the mobile communication arrangements<br>
are generally embodied in a multi-cellular fashion so that a<br>
plurality of overlapping radio zones are used in order to bring<br>
about area coverage.<br>
A particular requirement in multi-cellular communication<br>
arrangements based on radio is the free mobility of the<br><br>
mobile communications terminals. Such a communications terminal<br>
not only has to be accessible within the entire arrangement but<br>
also a changeover of the radio cell should also be possible<br>
during the ongoing operation without interrupting the<br>
communication link and without interrupting the call. For this<br>
purpose, the individual radio cells are arranged in an<br>
overlapping fashion so that at the changeover of the mobile<br>
communications terminal from one radio cell to an adjacent<br>
radio cell a communication link can change the radio cell used<br>
while present in an overlapping radio zone.<br>
In the arrangements with mobile communications terminals it has<br>
proven disadvantageous that a period of time in which the<br>
communication link is briefly interrupted and during which no<br>
useful data can be transmitted to the communications terminal<br>
or from the communications terminal is present between the<br>
release of the communication link in a first radio cell and the<br>
setting up or the continuation of the communication link in a<br>
second radio cell. This brief interruption is usually felt to<br>
be disruptive. The disadvantages described apply equally to the<br>
transition between different networks, for example for the<br>
handover between a private (W)LAN and a public GSM network.<br>
These disadvantages are often overcome in the prior art by<br>
virtue of the fact that the individual radio cells of<br>
communication arrangements are operated in synchronism with one<br>
another. For example, the useful data which is transmitted from<br>
the fixed network to the mobile communications terminal is<br>
transmitted simultaneously "in parallel" by all the radio cells<br>
at least at the time of the switchover so that at the<br>
switchover no breaks in transmission occur as a result of the<br>
release or the setting up of partial communication links - the<br>
term useful data streams is frequently also used. A<br>
disadvantage with this procedure is, however, the increased<br>
network load and the problem that<br><br>
a plurality of radio base stations (access points) have to be<br>
supplied simultaneously with the same useful data (duplicated<br>
useful data stream) . This can usually be implemented only in<br>
arrangements with a small number of radio cells which are<br>
preferably controlled by the same network node, and is<br>
therefore generally done in this way only in the case of<br>
relatively small, private "cordless" arrangements.<br>
In the meantime, nonsynchronous radio networks, for example<br>
radio-based "WLAN" data networks according to IEEE 802.11 are<br>
being increasingly used. While brief breaks in transmission can<br>
usually be tolerated during a changeover of the radio cell for<br>
non-real-time communication, that is to say for the classic<br>
data transmission mode, the interruptions have an adverse<br>
effect on the convenience of use for real-time communication,<br>
that is to say for example for the transmission of voice data<br>
(VoIP = Voice-over-Internet-Protocol). This problem is<br>
minimized by keeping the interruption at the changeover of a<br>
radio cell as short as possible. For this purpose, work is<br>
currently also being carried out on new standards, for example<br>
IEEE 802.11R "fast roaming"/"fast handoff". By accelerating the<br>
"handover" process (changeover of the radio cell) it is<br>
possible here to reduce the adverse effect on the communication<br>
link but not eliminate it completely. This applies in<br>
particular at the multiple changeover of the radio cells, the<br>
propagation time delays either cumulating or fragments of the<br>
voice data stream having to be rejected in order to avoid<br>
exceeding an appropriate overall delay time.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to minimize<br>
the adverse effects at the changeover of a connecting path<br>
during a communication link.<br>
The object is achieved for the method by means of the features<br>
of independent patent claim 1, and for the communications<br>
terminal by means of the features of independent patent claim 10.<br><br>
The solution provides a method for outputting a useful data<br>
stream at the changeover between a first transmission path and<br>
a second transmission path, wherein a break in reception occurs<br>
for the useful data stream at a receiver during the changeover<br>
between an end of reception of a first partial useful data<br>
stream of the first transmission path and a start of reception<br>
of a second partial useful data stream of the second<br>
transmission path, and wherein the useful data stream is output<br>
at the receiver end. Here, during the output of the useful data<br>
stream the break in reception is filled with additional useful<br>
data, wherein the additional useful data is generated from the<br>
first partial useful data stream which has previously been<br>
received over the first transmission path. The application of<br>
this method makes the changeover from the first transmission<br>
path, for example first radio cell, to the second transmission<br>
path, for example second radio cell, virtually or completely<br>
disruption-free for the receiver. Disruptive gaps (artifacts)<br>
are filled in by the method so that a useful signal can be<br>
output for the receiver continuously at any time.<br>
The solution of the object further provides a communications<br>
terminal for receiving and for outputting a useful data stream,<br>
wherein the useful data stream can be switched over from a<br>
first link to a second link. In this context, the<br>
communications terminal is equipped with a generating device<br>
for generating additional useful data, and the communications<br>
terminal is provided with a mixing device for the weighted<br>
addition of the additional useful data to the useful data<br>
stream which is received over the second link. The use of such<br>
a communications terminal fills in a "gap" in the useful data<br>
stream at the changeover of a communication link, for example<br>
between two radio cells. It is irrelevant here whether the<br>
"gap" arises due to a delay or because parts of the useful data<br>
stream (data packets) are lost. The weighted addition of the<br>
additional useful data with the received useful data stream<br>
ensures a "gentle" transition in which specifically the<br><br>
weighting can be used to<br><br>
maintain a constant signal energy level. Avoiding a fluctuating<br>
average signal energy level prevents a receiver being<br>
irritated.<br>
The method is advantageously developed by means of the features<br>
of dependent patent claims 2 to 9. The features and advantages<br>
described here apply appropriately also to the communications<br>
terminal according to the invention. The communications<br>
terminal is advantageously developed by means of the features<br>
of dependent patent claims 11 to 14 whose features and<br>
advantages are also to be appropriately applied to the method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Irritation at a receiver or user is reduced or avoided if the<br>
additional useful data is generated by chronologically<br>
stretching at least part of the first partial useful data<br>
stream. As a result, the chronological gap at the changeover is<br>
filled by useful data which originates to a large extent from<br>
the first partial useful data stream and therefore ideally has<br>
a real information content, in contrast to the alternative,<br>
which is however easy to implement, of filling the<br>
chronological gap, that is to say the break in reception, with<br>
a noise signal or the like.<br>
If, during the outputting after the break in reception, a data<br>
stream which is composed of the additional useful data and the<br>
second useful data stream is output for a transition time<br>
period, a "gentle" transition occurs which is frequently<br>
unremarkable and which a receiver therefore subjectively feels<br>
is nondisruptive. It is advantageous here if, for the<br>
generation of the composite useful data stream, the additional<br>
useful data is weighted with a first variable factor and the<br>
second useful data stream is weighted with a second variable<br>
factor, in which case the sum of the squared first variable<br>
factor and the squared second variable factor is at least<br>
virtually constant in each case. As a result,<br><br>
a largely constant signal energy level is ensured, with this<br>
signal energy level which is constant for the transition<br>
advantageously corresponding to the average signal energy level<br>
of the first partial useful data stream. Whereas phase shifts,<br>
for which the human ear is not very sensitive, can therefore<br>
occur at the changeover to a limited degree, signal energy<br>
fluctuations, that is to say consequently amplitude<br>
fluctuations, to which the human ear is sensitive, are<br>
partially or completely avoided. As a result, a subjectively<br>
pleasant, often unnoticeable changeover occurs between the<br>
transmission paths.<br>
The "filling in" of the break in reception results in a delay<br>
(phase shift) for the second partial useful data stream. This<br>
delay can be compensated for by chronologically compressing the<br>
second partial useful data stream after the complete changeover<br>
of the outputting onto the second partial useful data stream<br>
until the delay which has occurred owing to the break in<br>
reception is compensated for. This is particularly advantageous<br>
after a multiple changeover of the transmission paths because<br>
the breaks in reception (delays) which occur here in each case<br>
otherwise add to one another (cumulate), thus leading to a<br>
progressive worsening in quality.<br>
A particularly frequent application case occurs if a digital<br>
audio signal of a voice link (VoIP link) is used as the useful<br>
data stream. In these cases, cellular communication networks<br>
which are not optimized for voice data transmission (for<br>
example LAN/WLAN arrangements) can also be used for real-time<br>
communication links. In this case the mobility of a receiver is<br>
advantageously given by the fact that a radio link is used for<br>
at least one of the transmission paths. In this context, the<br>
method can also advantageously be used for nonhomogenous<br>
structures in which line-bound and radio-based transmission<br>
paths are used alternately in a mixed fashion. Another<br>
important application<br><br>
occurs if a first radio cell of a multi-cellular radio network<br>
is used as the first transmission path and a second radio cell<br>
of a multi-cellular radio network is used as the second<br>
transmission path, in which case the changeover is used for<br>
transferring a radio link from the first radio cell to the<br>
second radio cell. In this context, in particular the<br>
disadvantages which nonsynchronous radio cell arrangements have<br>
for real-time communication are reduced or even entirely<br>
avoided.<br>
The communications terminal according to the invention is<br>
advantageously used to carry out the method described above,<br>
with said terminal having a generating device for implementing<br>
a changeover process which is as unnoticeable as possible, said<br>
generating device being configured to stretch the useful data<br>
stream which is received over the first link. As a result, the<br>
break in reception is filled with "meaningful" useful data. The<br>
entire delay which occurs here can be compensated for again by<br>
the communications terminal if the latter has a device for<br>
chronologically compressing the useful data stream which is<br>
received over the second link, said device chronologically<br>
compressing the second partial useful data stream until the<br>
delay which has occurred owing to the break in reception has<br>
been compensated for again.<br>
The adverse effect during the outputting of the useful data<br>
stream is reduced further if the communications terminal has a<br>
sensing device for sensing breaks in speech in the useful data<br>
stream which is received over the first link and/or in a useful<br>
data stream which is to be transmitted, with the sensing device<br>
being configured to control the time for the switchover by<br>
reference to a detected break in speech. As a result, the<br>
changeover can be "shifted" into one of the breaks in speech<br>
which frequently occur in any .case so that the probability of a<br>
perceptible adverse effect is reduced further. In the case of<br><br>
useful data streams which do not have a break in speech or<br>
other signal breaks for a relatively long period of time, it is<br>
also possible to generate such a break "artificially" by, for<br>
example,<br><br>
"gentle" brief attenuation of the useful data stream, in which<br>
case the changeover of the transmission path is performed<br>
during this brief attenuation.<br>
The communications terminal also advantageously comprises a<br>
control device for defining parameters which, during the<br>
addition, determine the weighting of the additional useful data<br>
and/or of the useful data stream which is received over the<br>
second link. This ensures that a useful data stream with a<br>
largely constant signal energy level is output at the receiver,<br>
with irritation at the receiver as a result of a fluctuating<br>
signal energy level ("volume") being avoided.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention<br>
are explained below with reference to the drawings which serve<br>
at the same time to explain a communications terminal according<br>
to the invention.<br>
e<br>
In said drawings:*<br>
figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a communication<br>
arrangement in which a mobile communications terminal<br>
changes over between two radio cells,<br>
figure 2 is a schematic illustration of the useful data<br>
packets of two partial useful data streams along a<br>
time axis, and<br>
figure 3 is a schematic illustration of a communications<br>
terminal which is configured to change over between<br>
the two partial useful data streams.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a communication<br>
arrangement in which a mobile communications terminal EG is<br>
connected to a stationary party CP to the communication.<br><br>
Here, the party CP to the communication is connected via a<br>
communication node (not<br><br>
illustrated) to a public communication network NW, while the<br>
mobile communications terminal EG is connected via radio base<br>
stations API, AP2 (access points) to the communication network<br>
NW. The radio base stations API, AP2 each supply a radio zone<br>
FBI, FB2 (radio cell), the radio zones FBI, FB2 having a common<br>
overlapping area.<br>
The radio base stations API, AP2 are part of an asynchronous<br>
multi-cellular radio network, in this case what is referred to<br>
as a wireless LAN (WLAN). The useful data for the communication<br>
link is transmitted between the party CP to the communication<br>
and the communications terminal EG at least on the partial<br>
links between the radio base stations API, AP2 and the<br>
communications terminal EG, in each case packet-switched<br>
according to the Internet protocol (TCP-IP, UDP-IP).<br>
Within the scope of this exemplary embodiment it is assumed<br>
that the communications terminal EG is intended to change over<br>
from the radio zone FBI into the radio zone FB2 while the<br>
communication link is in existence, which is symbolized in<br>
figure 1 by an arrow.<br>
The communication link between the party CP to the<br>
communication and the mobile communications terminal EG<br>
comprises not only signaling messages (not considered here) but<br>
also a bidirectional useful data stream, and within the scope<br>
of this exemplary embodiment only the useful data stream from<br>
the party CP to the communication in the direction of the<br>
mobile communications terminal EG is to be considered. In this<br>
context, the communications terminal EG is firstly supplied in<br>
the radio zone FBI by a first partial useful data stream A from<br>
the radio base station API in a first link, and after the<br>
changeover in the radio zone FB2 by a second partial useful<br>
data stream B by the radio base station AP2 in a second link.<br>
The changeover is carried out while the communications terminal<br><br>
EG is located in the overlapping area of the radio zones FBI,<br>
FB2.<br>
The radio technology used in the radio zones FBI, FB2 is<br>
optimized for non-real-time communication, i.e. that at a<br>
changeover from one radio cell into an adjacent radio cell a<br>
chronological "gap" (delay) can occur but in this context no<br>
useful data or useful data packets are lost. Instead of the<br>
WLAN radio network considered here, it is however also<br>
alternatively possible to use a transmission method which is<br>
optimized for real-time communication links. In such a method,<br>
no reception acknowledgement for useful data packets is often<br>
performed for reasons of optimizing propagation time (for<br>
example UDP protocol) . In this context it is possible, in<br>
particular at a changeover of the radio cell, for useful data<br>
packets either to be lost or else to arrive delayed at the<br>
receiver in such a way that they can no longer be taken into<br>
account (passed on) . In this context it is also possible for<br>
there to be chronological gaps which can be due both to delays<br>
and to data losses.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of the partial useful data<br>
streams A, B plotted against a time axis T, with the partial<br>
useful data streams A, B having data packets n, n+1, n+3, n+4<br>
which are illustrated as squares and have a digitized audio<br>
signal (audio data) which are transmitted from the party CP to<br>
the communication to the mobile communications terminal EG. At<br>
the time Tl, the changeover from the first partial useful data<br>
stream A to the second partial useful data stream B is<br>
initiated, with no further data packets being transmitted to<br>
the communications terminal EG by means of the partial useful<br>
data stream A after the time Tl. Since the next data packets<br>
n+2, n+3, n+4 which are illustrated as squares do not arrive at<br>
the communications terminal EG until after the time T2, a break<br>
in reception occurs which is filled in with additional useful<br>
data. In the present case, therefore, the last data packets n,<br><br>
n+1, which arrive by means of the partial useful data stream A<br>
and<br><br>
which are present in a reception data buffer, are<br>
chronologically stretched in such a way that new data packets<br>
are produced which themselves consist partially of the contents<br>
of the originally transmitted data packets n, n+1, and<br>
partially of artificially generated, additional information<br>
which consists, for example, of echo signal components and of<br>
interpolated useful data values. Methods for "stretching"<br>
digitized audio signals are adequately known in the prior art,<br>
for example also in the German patent application with the<br>
official application file number 103 270 57.4. A simple<br>
alternative is to output a "colored" noise signal which should<br>
correspond in its frequency spectrum to the average frequency<br>
spectrum of the previously received useful data.<br>
The additional data packets are characterized in figure 2 by<br>
means of triangles with the designations n+2, n+3. Starting<br>
from the time T2, "real" useful data packets n+2, n+3, n+4 are<br>
received by means of the partial useful data stream B, these<br>
useful data packets also being buffered in the reception data<br>
buffer and then being output. Therefore, at the time T2, when<br>
packets are passed on, switching over is performed between the<br>
additional data packets n+2, n+3 (represented by means of<br>
triangles) and the newly received data packets n+2, n+3, n+4<br>
(represented by squares).<br>
In order to make the transition "gentler", a mixed signal is<br>
output in the transition time between T2 and T3, with the data<br>
packets of the first partial useful data stream A being<br>
weighted (multiplied) with a variable factor Ci, and the data<br>
packets of the partial useful data stream B being weighted<br>
(multiplied) with a variable factor C2. In this context, the<br>
signal profiles for the factors Ci, C2 are strictly<br>
monotonously declining or rising. The sum of the squared<br>
factors Ci, C2 should at least approximately yield a constant<br>
value (in standardized systems this is the value 1) at any time<br>
so that<br><br>
a jump in the signal energy level of the last output signal<br>
passed on is avoided.<br>
The previously described process is advantageously performed in<br>
a break in speech. In this context, use is made of the fact<br>
that a relatively long time window is available for the<br>
changeover, and in this time window each of the two radio zones<br>
FBI, FB2 can reliably supply the communications terminal EG.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of the most important<br>
functional blocks of the communications terminal EG. Here, the<br>
voice data which is generated (the microphone M is illustrated<br>
here symbolically as a generating element) is directed either<br>
over a first transmission path A or over a second transmission<br>
path B depending on a switch position 0.1. On the other hand,<br>
the communications terminal EG is also configured to receive<br>
partial useful data streams A, B. A control device "Control"<br>
contains a sensing device VAD ("voice activity detection") for<br>
monitoring the voice activity in a useful data stream and a<br>
logic device "handover" for controlling the changeover process.<br>
As a result, the control device "Control" determines the time S<br>
of the switching over (that is to say of the changeover) and<br>
the value of the factors (parameters) Ci, C2 at any time.<br>
Furthermore, the control device "Control" generates control<br>
signals x, h (not illustrated here) for controlling a signal<br>
stretching device TSh and a signal compression device TSj..<br>
While the incoming partial useful data stream A firstly runs<br>
through the signal stretching device TSh as a generating device<br>
and is then weighted with the factor Ci, the useful data of the<br>
partial useful data stream B is weighted with the factor C2.<br>
Both resulting signals are added in a mixing device "+", are<br>
fed to the signal compression device TSi which is controlled by<br>
the control device Control, and said signals are then output<br>
via a loudspeaker L. It is to be noted here that the control<br>
device "Control" is not necessarily<br><br>
part of the terminal EG but can also be arranged in another<br>
entity (component) of the communication arrangement, even in a<br>
"distributed" form.<br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	A method for emitting a user-data stream when changing between a first<br>
and a second transmission path, wherein a reception pause for the user-<br>
data stream occurs at a receiver during the change between the end of<br>
the reception of a first partial user-data stream (A) with first data packets<br>
of the first transmission path and the beginning of the reception of a<br>
second partial user-data stream (B) with second data packets of the<br>
second transmission path, and<br>
wherein the user-data stream (A, B) is output at the receiver end,<br>
wherein, during the output of the user-data stream (A, B), the reception<br>
pause is filled in with additional user data that are generated from the first<br>
partial user-data stream (A) previously received over the first transmission<br>

characterised in that<br>
the additional user data are generated by time-stretching at least part of<br>
the first partial user-data stream (A), with a plurality of new data packets,<br>
each consisting of user data of the first data packets and of other user-<br>
data values generated from the user data of the first data packets, being<br>
generated for the output.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein during the output after the<br>
reception pause, a user-data stream made up of the additional user data<br>
and the second user-data stream (B) is output for a transitional period.<br><br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein for the generation of the<br>
composite user-data stream the additional user data are weighted with a<br>
first variable factor (C1) and the second user-data stream (B) with a<br>
second variable factor (C2), whereby the sum of the squared first and the<br>
squared second variable factor (C1, C2) is constant.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein after the<br>
complete change of the output to the second partial user-data stream (B),<br>
the second partial user-data stream (B) is time-compressed until the delay<br>
caused by the reception pause is equalised.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a<br>
digitised audio signal of a voice connection is used as the user-data<br>
stream (A, B).<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein this audio signal is monitored for<br>
speech pauses and the change is carried out in a speech pause.<br>
7.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a radio<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "A METHOD FOR EMITTING A USER-DATA STREAM WHEN<br>
CHANGING BETWEEN A FIRST AND A SECOND TRANSMISSION PATH.<br>
AND A COMMUNICATION TERMINAL"<br>
The invention relates to a method for emitting a user-data stream when<br>
changing between a first and a second transmission path, wherein a reception<br>
pause for the user-data stream occurs at a receiver during the change between<br>
the end of the reception of a first partial user-data stream (A) with first data<br>
packets of the first transmission path and the beginning of the reception of a<br>
second partial user-data stream (B) with second data packets of the second<br>
transmission path, and wherein the user-data stream (A, B) is output at the<br>
receiver end, wherein, during the output of the user-data stream (A, B), the<br>
reception pause is filled in with additional user data that are generated from the<br>
first partial user-data stream (A) previously received over the first transmission<br>
path, the additional user data are generated by time-stretching at least part of<br>
the first partial user-data stream (A), with a plurality of new data packets, each<br>
consisting of user data of the first data packets and of other user-data values<br>
generated from the user data of the first data packets, being generated for the<br>
output.</td>
