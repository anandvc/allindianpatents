				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates generally to radio access networks and more specifically to<br>
methods and means for assisting handover of a communication session in such networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
FIG 1 illustrates the basic network architecture of a conventional radio access<br>
network 100, in form of a wireless local area network, WLAN, comprising a first access<br>
point API 110, a second access point AP2 120, and an Access Router, AR 150. The<br>
WLAN 100 may be connected to other network/s 160 such as e.g. the Internet and/or a<br>
UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network). In FIG. 1, API 110 and AP2 120<br>
are connected with AR 150 via Multicast-enabled Layer 2 Switches, M-L2S1 130 and M-<br>
L2S2 135, respectively, but many other possibilities exist. The APs may e.g. be connected<br>
directly to AR 150 without any intermediate M-L2Ss, or they may be connected to the<br>
same M-L2S which in turn is connected to AR 150. Since the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)<br>
protocol is used for most of the WLAN access points today as layer 2 protocol to<br>
communicate with fixed network infrastructure, an M-L2S is identical with an Ethernet<br>
switch. A User Terminal, UT, 140 having a communication session, e.g. a data session or a<br>
Voice over IP session with a peer connected to the network 160 (e.g. Internet or UTRAN),<br>
routed via API, 110, normally performs a handover of the session from API, 110, to AP2,<br>
120, whenever a certain handover criterion is fulfilled. The criterion is normally a function<br>
of the offered radio link quality and/or QoS (quality of service) of API 110 and AP2 120,<br>
respectively, so that the UT's 140 communication session will be routed through the<br>
access point offering the highest/best radio link quality/QoS, in a conventional manner.<br>
However, the handover criterion may be based on other aspects e.g. regarding accounting,<br>
security etc.<br>
General problems regarding effective handover schemes for radio access networks<br>
relate e.g. to data loss minimization, interference suppression, packet delay minimization<br>
and to minimize network signaling.<br>
More specifically, for the WLAN in FIG. 1 exploiting the IEEE 802 standard, the<br>
establishment of a security association between the UT 140 and a target AP, i.e. AP2 120<br>
in case of a handover from API 110 to AP2 120 in FIG. 1, when applying a standard EAP<br>
(Extensible Authentication Protocol) authentication in accordance with the IEEE 802.Hi<br>
security specification may pose a crucial issue regarding the caused interruption time, i.e.<br>
2<br><br>
it may cause unacceptable packet delay/loss for real time applications such as voice and/or<br>
video. Such an authentication is carried out after that the UT 140 has been successfully<br>
associated with the new AP (AP2 120 according to above example), and the radio link<br>
connectivity between UT 140 and the old AP (API, 110) is thus already aborted. During<br>
the period between the initiation of association with a new target AP (AP2, 120) and<br>
completion of the EAP authentication and installation of the security parameters at the<br>
new target AP, no data (e.g. IP-) packets can be exchanged between UT 140 and AR 150<br>
over the WLAN transmission path, which of-course constitutes a problem.<br>
Another problem associated with the handover of TCP-sessions in radio access<br>
networks is that received packets being out of order will be retransmitted, which increases<br>
the radio interference, and the transmission rate may also be tuned down as a consequence,<br>
since the TCP interprets packets being out of order as a network congestion state.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to mitigate/solve above problems.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the handover characteristics of<br>
radio access networks, such as e.g. a WLAN or a UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access Network).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to minimize data loss and/or to decrease the<br>
interference and/or the packet delay/loss and/or the network signaling, during a handover<br>

memory, M, 211,221,241 and 251 have a second buffer memory space, 214,224,244<br>
and 254, allocated, for temporary storage of data packets associated with the UT 240, as<br>
explained further below. The UT 240 has a conventional first buffer memory 245,<br>
normally a FIFO, in which data packets/frames demodulated by the radio receiver unit of<br>
UT 240 are temporarily stored before they are forwarded to a higher protocol layer or to<br>
the right higher level final application (e.g. an end user multi-media application such as<br>
VoIP, Voice over IP) by the LLC-protocol, in a conventional manner. It is to be<br>
understood that the WLAN in FIG. 2 is only an illustrative example and that the invention<br>
may be realized in any radio access network, such as a e.g. a 3GPP UTRAN, wherein a<br>
3GPP radio base station Node B corresponds with API, 210, a 3GPP radio network<br>
controller, RNC, corresponds with AR 250 etc, as understood by a person skilled in the<br>
art. However, the invention is advantageously realized in wireless data networks according<br>
to the IEEE 802 standard protocol, such as e.g. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN,<br>
IEEE 802.15), Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN, IEEE 802.16), Mobile<br>
Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA, IEEE 802.20), Wireless Regional Area Networks<br>
(WRAN, IEEE 802.22) etc, exploiting the EAP authentication scheme which causes<br>
significant delays during handover, since the invention decreases packet delay during<br>
handover.<br>

FIG. 3 illustrates an example of the user plane and control plane protocol stacks at<br>
UT, 240, API, 210, M-L2S1,230 and AR, 250, in Fig. 2A. The protocol stack for M-<br>
L2S2,235, is identical with the stack of M-L2S1,230, and M-L2S2,235 has therefore<br>
been left out in Fig. 3. The physical layer 1 in Fig. 3, LI, at AR 350, M-L2S1,230 and<br>
API, 210, is a conventional Ethernet physical layer, above which a conventional WLAN-<br>
MAC layer is installed, i.e. the IEEE 802.3 MAC protocol, defining data ports for the<br>
various nodes in a conventional manner. The UT 340 and the API 310 have conventional<br>
IEEE 802.11 physical and MAC protocol layers installed, defining a physical radio link<br>
layer and data ports for UT 340 and API, 310, in a conventional manner. A conventional<br>
link control layer in the form of a IEEE 802.2 LLC-layer is installed above the MAC layer<br>
at UT 340, API, 310 and AR 350. The UT 340, API, 310, and AR 350 has further an IP<br>
protocol and a UDP/TCP protocol (not illustrated at UT 340) installed above the LLC<br>
layer. The UT 340 and AR 350 has further higher protocol layers/applications installed,<br>
such as e.g. a multi media application at UT 340 and packet handling applications (e.g.<br>
regarding tunneling, routing etc) at AR 350, in a conventional manner. The protocol layers<br>
allow the UT 340 and AR 250 to establish logical data connections by conventional<br>
protocol layer processing, as a person skilled in the art realizes. For instance, the MAC<br>
layer filters out packets intended for the physical device, the LLC layer forwards the<br>
packets to the "right" layer/application which in turn may forward the packet further up to<br>
a specific layer/application until it is received by the "right" final application or protocol<br>
layer. The Access Point Management Entity (APME) at API, 310, in Fig. 3 is not a<br>
layered protocol since it represents the main operational program of the API, 310, which<br>
implements AP manufacturer's proprietary features and algorithms, and incorporates the<br>
Station Management Entity (SME) of IEEE 802.11, e.g., the APME receives Association<br>
Request messages from WLAN terminals (UTs) and takes further action accordingly.<br>
What is important is that the STAME application at UT 340 and APME application at<br>
API, 310, allow the UT 340 and API, 310 to exchange and interpret various control<br>
messages, e.g. regarding radio link measurement etc. The Inter Access Point Protocol<br>
(IAPP) as specified in IEEE 802.1 If standard is installed in all the AP's of the network,<br>
such as at the API, 310, and at AR 350, as illustrated in Fig 3. The IAPP allows the API,<br>
310 and AR 350 to communicate with each other, e.g. for signaling various control<br>
messages. The IAPP protocol also allows the API, 210 and AP2,220, to communicate<br>
with each other, in a conventional manner. The IAPP entity requires UDP and TCP to<br>
12<br><br>
distribute its messages as IP packets towards other IAPP entities, e.g. in order to notify a<br>
new association of a WLAN terminal at the API, 310. M-L2S1, 330, only functions as a<br>
relay of Ethernet frames to the destined stations or other L2 devices. The Ethernet frames<br>
may be unicast, multicast or broadcast frames. In one embodiment, the UT 340 has further<br>
a WLAN authentication entity installed, e.g. according to the 802. IX<br>
EAP/TLS/TTLS/PEAP standard, allowing UT 340 to communicate with a corresponding<br>
authentication entity of the WLAN, e.g. in form of a RADIUS or DIAMETER server<br>
connected to API, 310, for authentication purposes. The RADIUS or DIAMETER server<br>
may e.g. be integrated in AR 350, but many possibilities exist. Many other protocol<br>
options exist, as a person skilled in the art realizes, e.g. a LWAPP, (Light Weight Access<br>
Point Protocol), could be used instead of the IAPP, or RLC/RNC protocols could be used<br>
instead of the LLC/IAPP in case of a UTRAN etc. The RADIUS server normally exploits<br>
a conventional RADIUS protocol, e.g. as specified by the documents RFC 3579 (RADIUS<br>
support for EAP), RFC 2865, RFC 2869 (RADIUS Extensions), RFC 3576 (Dynamic<br>
Authorization Extensions to RADIUS) and RFC 3580 (IEEE 802.1X RADIUS Usage<br>
Guidelenes) and the DIAMETER server normally exploits a conventional DIAMETER<br>
protocol, e.g. as specified by RFC 3588 (DIAMETER Base Protocol), along with a<br>
conventional EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), e.g. as defined by standard AAA-<br>
(Authenticating, Authorization, Accounting) protocols RFC 2284 - PPP EAP, RFC 4017<br>
(EAP requirements for WLAN) or RFC 3748 (EAP) or RFC 2716 (PPP EAP TLS) or the<br>
EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS Authentication Protocol), issued by the IETF standard<br>
organisation (Internet Engineering Task Force), and may further exploit the EAP-PEAP<br>
(Protected EAP Protocol), as a person skilled in the art realises.<br>
Now, with reference to FIG. 4 and FIG 6A and B, the method according to the<br>
invention shall be described in more detail when realized in the network illustrated in Fig.<br>
2A. It is assumed that each AP maintains its own up-to-date database containing<br>
information about the neighbor APs, whose coverage areas may overlap with its own (<br>
normally each AP has a stored list of the IDs, e.g. the WLAN MAC address, of all its<br>
neighboring APs. This way, each AP is capable to provide associated UTs with a site<br>
report according to IEEE 802.1 Ik specification, which contains information about other<br>
APs in proximity to which the UT may roam (or handoff). This may only be achieved if<br>
all the involved APs are controlled by the same operator or if special inter-operator<br>
agreements exist.<br>
13<br><br>
In step 4100, there is an ongoing communication session between UT 240 and a<br>
Host/peer (e.g. on the Internet 260), wherein e.g. IP-packets are routed over the WLAN by<br>
means of the IEEE 802.2 LLC layer (and lower layers), as illustrated by step 1 in FIG 6A.<br>
The communication session may e.g. be a conventional VoIP-session (Voice over IP). At<br>
any given time, once a WLAN connectivity between UT 240 and API, 210, is established,<br>
API, 210, sends a conventional conditional beacon frame request to UT 240, as illustrated<br>
by step 2 in FIG 6A. The request indicates the reporting condition that a (periodical)<br>
beacon report for API, 210, should be sent by UT 240 to API, 210, when the average<br>
RCPI (Received Channel Power Indicator) level falls below a specified threshold value.<br>
The UT 240 then performs passive scanning and evaluates the current RCPI level<br>
continuously within certain measurement duration.<br>
In step 4110 the reporting condition is met, (i.e. RCPI level below threshold is<br>
determined), and the UT 240 sends a conventional beacon report to API, 210, illustrated<br>
by step 3 in FIG 6B, which thus estimates that the UT 240 will leave the coverage area of<br>
API, 210, soon and that a handover is to be effectuated. According to its own AP location<br>
database, API, 210, knows that its coverage area (partly) overlaps with the coverage area<br>
of one or some neighbor APs, including AP2,220. However API, 210, may not be<br>
capable to determine whether or not UT 240 is currently within this overlap area.<br>
In step 4120, API, 210 sends a conventional site report to UT 240, illustrated by<br>
step 4 in FIG 6A, in order to support the UT 240 to carry out its handover procedure,<br>
which site report includes further information about AP2,220, (i.e., its BSSID, PHY type,<br>
channel, etc.) and other neighbor APs. This site report informs the UT 240 about the<br>
registered neighbor APs, to which the UT 240 can associate according to the user's<br>
(subscription) profile. The UT 240 may also receive conventional broadcast beacon frames<br>
from APs that do not belong to the UT's 240 operator's network.<br>
In step 4130, the UT 240 initiates a conventional passive scanning to find a suitable<br>
AP having an adequate RCPI level. By performing passive scanning, the UT 240 may or<br>
may not receive beacon frames from the listed neighbour APs, depending on the UT's,<br>
240, geographical location. Assuming that UT 240 receives the beacon frames broadcasted<br>
by AP2,220, as illustrated by step 5 in FIG 6A, the UT 240 compares the RCPI level of<br>
AP2,220, with the RCPI level of API and decides to change the association from API,<br>
210, to AP2,220, if the RCPI level of AP2,220, exceeds the RCPI level of API, 210, in a<br>
14<br><br>
conventional manner, i.e. the UT 240 decides to cany out a handover from API, 210 to<br>
AP2,220.<br>
In step 4140, the UT announces the handover decision by sending a conventional<br>
standard Probe Request frame to AP2,220, illustrated by step 6 in FIG 6A. AP2,220,<br>
responds with a conventional Probe Response frame, as illustrated by step 7 in FIG 6A,<br>
which contains conventional detailed information about AP2,220. According to the<br>
invention, the AP2,220, then sends a handover intention notify message to API, 210,<br>
and/or AR 250, indicating a handover to AP2,220, and comprising a session identifier<br>
uniquely identifying the communication session of UT 240. The handover intention notify<br>
message may also comprise identifiers uniquely identifying AP2,220, and/or UT 240, e.g.<br>
the WLAN MAC address of AP2,220 and/or UT 240, for reasons explained further<br>
below. The session identifier may e.g. be a conventional LLC-connection identifier or a<br>
conventional TCP/IP-flow identifier or the WLAN MAC address, or the IP-address, of UT<br>
240. The handover intention notify message may e.g. be realized as a modified IAPP-<br>
PROBE.Notify packet, as illustrated by step 8 in FIG 6B, which conventionally also<br>
includes the UT's WLAN MAC address, by adding said session identifier in a suitable<br>
data field or by simply defining the WLAN MAC address of UT 240 to be said session<br>
identifier, as understood by a person skilled in the art. The handover intention notify<br>
packet may in this case also have a defined handover identifier field, which may be set to<br>
"1" to indicate a handover intention and to "0" otherwise, in order to allow the receiving<br>
nodes to make a correct interpretation of the received message. However, the handover<br>
identifier may be left out and the receiving nodes (i.e. the API, 210 and AR 250) may be<br>
modified/arranged to interpret this handover intention notify message correctly even<br>
without such an identifier, as a person skilled in the art realises. This modified IAPP<br>
packet, which is sent as UDP/IP packet, is not defined in the IEEE 802.1 If specification,<br>
but a person skilled in the art realizes how to realise such an IAPP packet given the<br>
described functionality above. The handover intention notify message, in form of the<br>
modified IAPP-PROBE. NOTIFY packet, is normally multicasted to a group address<br>
towards M-L2S2, but may alternatively be unicasted to API, 210, and/or AR 250, e.g. in<br>
case AP2,220 knows that the session in question is currently associated with API, 210,<br>
(e.g. signaled by UT 240). The multicast address is according to the invention chosen in<br>
such a way that the neighbour APs (including API) and/or AR 250 receive/s the handover<br>
intention notify - IAPP packet. The handover intention notify message may alternatively<br>
15<br><br>
be formed and sent by UT 240 to API, 210, which forwards it to the AR 250, but still<br>
other possibilities exist.<br>
In step 4150, the API, 210, interprets the received handover intention notify<br>
message (e.g. in form of the modified IAPP-PROBE.Notify packet) as the intention of UT<br>
240 to perform a session handover from API, 210, to AP2,220. According to the<br>
invention, API, 210, then starts caching (buffering) the downlink IP packets addressed to<br>
UT, 240, in memory (213). This reduces the risk of packet loss and the necessary amount<br>
of re-transmitted packets, (and thereby the interference level and network signaling) at<br>
least in a statistical sense. In one embodiment, in case said handover intention notify<br>
message comprises an identifier uniquely identifying AP2,220, e.g. the WLAN MAC<br>
address of AP2,220, then API, 210 starts to forward packets to AP2,220, immediately, as<br>
a response on receiving said handover intention notify message. This allows for a reduced<br>
packet delay and a "smoother" handover. According to an alternative embodiment, API,<br>
210, continues to transmit downlink packets over its radio link to UT 240, and<br>
simultaneously forwards duplicate packets to AP2,220, allowing a soft handover<br>
realisation. Furthermore, in step 4150, according to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
AR 250 may start to buffer downlink data packets of said session (i.e. addressed to UT<br>
240) in a buffer memory (253) instead of forwarding them to API (210), as a response on<br>
receiving said handover intention notify message. This decreases the risk of packet<br>
delay/loss/retransmission and, in case the AR 250 forwards the downlink packets only to<br>
AP2,220, also reduces the necessary buffer memory size at API, 210, as a person skilled<br>
in the art realises. In one embodiment, in case said handover intention notify message<br>
comprises an identifier uniquely identifying the AP2,220, e.g. the WLAN MAC address<br>
of AP2,220, the AR 250 immediately starts to route downlink packets of said session to<br>
AP2,220, instead of API, 210. In an alternative embodiment, AR 250 starts to send<br>
downlink packets addressed to UT 240 to both API, 210, and AP2,220, as a response on<br>
said handover intention notify message, allowing a soft handover (bi-casting) by duplicate<br>
transmission over the respective radio link of API, 210, and AP2,220. This further<br>
reduces packet delays during the handover by means of a soft handover realisation.<br>
In step 4160, the UT 240 starts the (open system) EAP authentication procedure<br>
with AP2,220, and sends a conventional Association Request frame to AP2,220, as<br>
illustrated by step 9 in FIG 6B. This triggers an abortion of the radio connectivity between<br>
UT 240 and API, 210, in a conventional manner. According to one embodiment of the<br>
16<br><br>
invention, this also triggers a packet re-sequencing algorithm at UT 240, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5, and described further below. At the same time, since API, 210, does not receive<br>
any beacon reports from UT 240, the API, 210 sends after a certain pre-established time,<br>
Tl, a handover intention notify message to AR 250, according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, e.g. in case API, 210, has not yet sent this message to AP2,220. As<br>
already stated, the handover intention notify message comprises a session identifier, e.g.<br>
an LLC-connection identifier or IP-connection identifier or the WLAN address, or IP-<br>
address, of UT 240, uniquely identifying the data session and may be realized as above<br>
described modified IAPP PROBE Notify packet or e.g. as a modified LAPP-<br>
LEA VE.Notify packet, as illustrated by step 10 in FIG 6B. A person skilled in the art<br>
realizes how form a handover intention notify message with the described functionality by<br>
modifying these IEEE 802 standard packets. This provides a possibility of early "warning"<br>
to the AR 250 that a handover is to be carried out so that the AR 250 may start buffer<br>
session downlink packets as early as possible, which reduces the overall packet delay/loss<br>
and network signaling, at least in a statistical sense. Thus, the AR 250 may receive a<br>
handover intention notify message from API, 210, and/or AP2,220, and which message<br>
arrives first depends on network settings such as Tl etc. Alternately, a handover intention<br>
notify message, e.g. in form of a modified IAPP-LEAVE.Notify packet, may be sent from<br>
UT 240 to AR 250 via AP2,220, in step 4140. Many possibilities exist.<br>
In step 4170, when UT 240 has been associated with AP2,220, AP2 multicasts an<br>
association update message, e.g. as a IAPP-ADD .Notify packet, as illustrated by step 11 in<br>
FIG 6B, towards M-L2S2. The IAPP-ADD.Notify packet is sent as a multicast UDP/IP<br>
packet to notify other APs (e.g. API, 210) and AR 250 about the new association of the<br>
particular UT (UT 240 in this case) at the new target AP (i.e.AP2,220). AP2,220,<br>
concludes the association procedure by sending a conventional Association Response<br>
message to UT 240, as illustrated by step 12 in FIG 6B. According to the invention, the<br>
IAPP-ADD .Notify packet includes a session identifier uniquely identifying the session in<br>
question and may also comprise a sequence number indicating the packet's validity, along<br>
with the WLAN MAC address of UT 240 and/or AP2,220. The multicast IP (or MAC)<br>
address should be selected in such a way that only the AR 250 and other relevant APs (i.e.<br>
at least API, 210), which are geographically closely located to the sending AP2,220, can<br>
receive the IAPP-ADD.Notify packet, in order not to introduce excessive signaling within<br>
the WLAN domain. The multicast IP (or MAC) address specified for the L2 update frame<br>
17<br><br>
must be chosen in such a way that intermediate M-L2Ss and AR 250 can receive it to<br>
allow them to update their bridging table, if necessary. In accordance with its multicast IP<br>
(or MAC) address the IAPP-ADD.Notify packet will be received by API, 210, and AR,<br>
250. Since AP2,220, is connected to the same M-L2S as API, 210, M-L2S1,230, and<br>
AR, 250, need not update their bridging tables. This means that AR, 250, will continue to<br>
forward all downlink IP packets for UT 240 through M-L2S1,230, and M-L2S2,235, as it<br>
did before receiving the L2 update frame and/or IAPP-ADD .notify packet. According to<br>
the invention, the API, 210, and AR 250 starts to forward downlink packets for said<br>
session to AP2,220, after having received this IAPP-ADD.Notify packet. This reduces the<br>
risk of packet delay/loss and the signaling within the WLAN during the handover, thereby<br>
providing a more "smooth" handover. It shall be understood that the present invention<br>
may be realised by means of (optionally) modified IAPP-MOVE.Notify packet/s along<br>
with IAPP-MOVE RESPONSE.Notify packet/s and/or by means of (optionally) modified<br>
IAPP-CASH.Notify packet/s along with IAPP-CASH.Response packet/s, instead of the<br>
above described (optionally) modified IAPP-ADD.notify packet/s, as a person skilled in<br>
the art realises. The IAPP-MOVE.Notify packet is then preferably unicasted by AP2,220,<br>
to API, 210, (as a dedicated message), further decreasing network signaling.<br>
In step 4180, after that the AP2,220, has sent the conventional Association<br>
Response in step 4170, the conventional 802. IX (EAP) based authentication is then<br>
carried out between UT, 240, AP2,220 and the network authentication entity (e.g. a<br>
RADIUS entity integrated in AR 250), as illustrated by step 13 in FIG 6B. Downlink and<br>
uplink IP packets can be sent over the radio link between UT 240 and the AP2,220, as<br>
soon as the EAP authentication procedure is completed. Meanwhile, in step 4180, AP2,<br>
220, receives session downlink packets from AR 250 and/or API, 210, and buffers them in<br>
memory 223. All session downlink IP packets (encapsulated as LLC/Ethernet frames), that<br>
are still cached in API, 210, and/or not yet transmitted to or acknowledged by UT 240,<br>
can be sent directly to AP2,220, as illustrated by step 14 in FIG 6B, or alternatively,<br>
removed since their re-transmissions, if necessary, can be conducted between UT 240 and<br>
AR 250 through AP2,220. This forwarding procedure is thus carried out while the EAP<br>
authentication between UT 240 and AP2,220, and the network authentication entity, is<br>
still ongoing since both procedures are independent to each other. Since M-L2S2 has<br>
already updated its bridging table, according to their destination MAC address (i.e., UT's<br>
WLAN MAC address) the LLC/Ethernet frames can be forwarded through the specified<br>
18<br><br>
port of M-L2S2,235, to which AP2,220, is connected. The forwarded packets should not<br>
be routed through M-L2S1,230. The LLC/Ethernet frames forwarded by API, 210, and<br>
AR 250 via M-L2S1,230 (including new downlink packets), are according to the<br>
invention cached in memory 223 at AP2,220, and transmitted to UT 240 immediately<br>
after the EAP authentication procedure is completed. Memory 223 may be a FIFO<br>
memory, first in first out, so that a reordering of the downlink LLC/Ethernet frames must<br>
be performed by an algorithm residing at the LLC layer of UT 240, according to the<br>
invention. This solves problems regarding the TCP interpreting packets out of order as<br>
network congestion, and provides a "smoother" handover, especially important for real<br>
time applications such as VoIP. The session handover is concluded after both uplink and<br>
downlink IP packets can be exchanged as LLC/Ethernet frames between UT 240 and AR<br>
250 through AP2,220, and the corresponding M-L2Ss, as illustrated by step 15 in FIG 6B.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the completion of the EAP<br>
authentication procedure triggers a packet re-sequencing algorithm of UT 240, as<br>
illustrated and described further with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
FIG 2B illustrates another example of a network architecture for which the<br>
invention is applicable. In FIG 2B, we may consider a session wherein the UT 240 is<br>
currently associated with API, 210', (i.e., old AP) and the IP packets, that are<br>
encapsulated as LLC/Ethernet frames, are being exchanged between UT 240' and AR 250'<br>
through the WLAN transmission path. The link between API, 210', and AR, 250', is thus<br>
bridged by two M-L2Ss, i.e., M-L2S1,230', and M-L2S2,235'. In contrast to the previous<br>
HO-1 scenario described with reference to FIG 2A, AP2,220', is connected to a different<br>
M-L2S, i.e., M-L2S3,236. However, both layer 2 switches, i.e., M-L2S2,235', and M-<br>
L2S3,236', are connected to the same AR, 250', via M-L2S1,230'. The coverage areas of<br>
API, 210', and AP2,220', are assumed to be (partly) overlapped and we consider a<br>
situation where UT 240' is going to hand off its current data session from API, 210', to<br>
AP2,220',(i.e.,newAP).<br>
In general, the session handover procedure for the network in FIG 2B is quite<br>
similar with the one illustrated in FIG 2A. The main differences between the procedures<br>
relate to steps 4140 and 4170, in the following way:<br>
In step 4140: UT 240' sends a Probe Request frame to AP2,220', to "announce"<br>
its intention to perform handover to AP2,220'. After responding with a Probe Response<br>
frame, AP2,220', sends the (non-standard) IAPP-PROBE.Notify packet, which includes<br>
19<br><br>
the UT's 240' WLAN MAC address, to a multicast group address towards M-L2S3,236.<br>
The multicast address should be chosen in such a way that API, 210', (in general the<br>
neighbour APs) and AR, 250', receives the IAPP packet after it is routed through M-L2S3,<br>
236, M-L2S1,230', and M-L2S2,235'. API, 210', interprets the received IAPP-<br>
PROBE.Notify packet as the intention of UT 240' to perform a session handover from<br>
API, 210', to AP2,220'. API, 210', then starts caching the downlink IP packets for UT,<br>
240', which will be forwarded to AP2,220', as soon as the handover takes place. The AR,<br>
250', may use the information provided in the IAPP-PROBE.Notify packet to make its<br>
own decision whenever it receives an IAPP-LEAVE.Notify packet, which includes the<br>
UT's WLAN MAC address.<br>
In step 4170: After UT, 240', is successfully associated with AP2,220', AP2,220',<br>
multicasts the layer 2 update frame and the corresponding IAPP-ADD.Notify packet<br>
towards M-L2S3,236. The multicast MAC address of this L2 frame is chosen in such a<br>
way that M-L2S1,230', AR, 250', and M-L2S2,235', (and other L2 devices between<br>
them) can receive the L2 frame and update their bridging table. In accordance with its<br>
multicast IP address the IAPP-ADD.Notify packet will be received by API, 210', and AR,<br>
250'. Since AP2,220', is connected to the same AR, 250' as API, 210', i.e., via M-L2S1,<br>
230', no update of AR's, 250', bridging table is necessary (an update is required at M-<br>
L2S3, M-L2S1 and M-L2S2). This means that AR, 250', will continue to forward all the<br>
downlink IP packets for UT, 240', through M-L2S1,230', which now routes the packets<br>
through M-L2S3,236, (instead of M-L2S2,235').<br>
Furthermore, API, 210', may optionally forward all UT downlink IP packets<br>
(encapsulated as LLC/Ethernet frames), that are still cached in API, 210', and/or not yet<br>
acknowledged, to AP2,220', through the switches M-L2S2,235', M-L2S1,230', and M-<br>
L2S3,236. This is possible because all these three L2 switches have already updated their<br>
bridging tables, and can therefore route the LLC/Ethernet frames based on its specified<br>
destination MAC address (i.e., UT's WLAN MAC address).<br>
The present invention provides a packet re-sequencing algorithm for UT 240, the<br>
working method of which shall now be described in more detail, with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
The re-sequencing algorithm normally resides at the LLC layer of UT 240 and is<br>
advantageously triggered by any conventional authentication procedure taking place<br>
between the UT 240 and the radio access network 200. For instance, the re-sequencing<br>
algorithm may be triggered by the UT 240 sending a conventional Association Request<br>
20<br><br>
frame to AP2,220, as described in association with step 4160 above, or e.g. by the<br>
completion of the EAP authentication procedure in step 4180, described above. Since the<br>
re-sequencing algorithm according to the invention reduces packet delay (reduced packet<br>
loss), it is advantageously used in combination with an authentication procedure, which<br>
itself is time consuming. Alternatively, the re-sequencing algorithm may be triggered by a<br>
handover decision taken by a suitable network node such as API (210) or AP2 (220) or<br>
AR, 250, in the network of FIG 2A, and signaled to UT 240, or taken by UT (240). Many<br>
possibilities exist and it is obvious for a person skilled in the art how to realize such a<br>
triggering.<br>
In step 5010, a first data packet addressed to said UT (240) and received from API<br>
(210) is fetched in a conventional manner from the first buffer memory 245 of UT 240 in<br>
which demodulated packets received over the radio link are temporarily stored before<br>
being forwarded to the "right" final higher level application, e.g. a real time multi-media<br>
application or a VoIP application. Since the re-sequencing algorithm is triggered before<br>
the AP2,220, has started to transmit downlink packets to the UT 240, the algorithm<br>
interprets any (i.e it fetches the first "packet in the queue") data packet in said first buffer<br>
memory 245 as being a packet from API, 210.<br>
In step 5020, a frame sequence number, FSN, is extracted from said first data<br>
packet, and said FSN is stored in a first memory space of a second buffer memory 243 of<br>
said UT 240. The first and second buffer memories may be physically separated<br>
memories, e.g. FIFOs, or may be defined by having different memory spaces allocated in<br>
e.g. a RAM 241 of said UT 240, but many possibilities exist. FSN may e.g. be a<br>
conventional LLC frame sequence number defined by the LLC protocol or a conventional<br>
IP-packet sequence number defined by the IP- or IPSec- or mobile IP-protocol or a<br>
conventional TCP- or SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) frame sequence<br>
number. The term "frame sequence number" shall here be interpreted to be any<br>
conventional sequence number identifying a packet or the payload thereof.<br>
In step 5030, said first packet is forwarded to a higher protocol layer, e.g. to "the<br>
right" final application running on said UT (240), e.g. a real time VoIP-application, in a<br>
conventional manner, as explained above.<br>
In step 5040, the next data packet addressed to said UT (240) is fetched from said<br>
first buffer memory 245.<br>
21<br><br>
In step 5050, the frame sequence number of said next data packet, FSNNEXT, is<br>
extracted.<br>
In step 5060, it is established whether said next packet is a consecutive packet of<br>
the last packet forwarded to the higher protocol layer/final application, referred to as "last<br>
forwarded packet" by comparing said FSNNEXT with said FSN. In case of extracted LLC<br>
packet sequence numbers, the "next packet" is a consecutive packet of the "last forwarded<br>
packet" if FSNNEXT=FSN +1, in case of extracted TCP frame sequence numbers, the<br>
"next packet" is a consecutive packet of the "last forwarded packet" if FSNNEXT=FSN<br>
+e.g.l460, since a commonly used segment size of TCP-packets comprise 1460 payload<br>
frames. The invention is however applicable for any segment size/s and a person skilled in<br>
the art knows how to realize said comparison in order to establish whether said "next<br>
packet" is a consecutive packet of said "last forwarded packet" or not. If it is established<br>
that said "next packet" is a consecutive packet of said "last forwarded packet", then the<br>
algorithm proceeds to step 5070, otherwise it proceeds to step 5080.<br>
In step 5070, said "next packet" is forwarded to a higher protocol layer/final<br>
application of UT 240 and the value of said FSNNEXT is stored in said first memory<br>
space of the second buffer memory (243). In one embodiment, said FSN is simply<br>
overwritten in said memory 243, thereby minimizing the required size of memory 243.<br>
The stored FSNNEXT value thus forms an updated FSN value for future frame sequence<br>
number comparisons in order to identify a consecutive packet of said "next packet" and so<br>
on. The algorithm then proceeds to step 5100.<br>
In step 5080, said "next packet" is buffered in a second memory space of said<br>
second buffer memory 243. Advantageously, said next packet" is stored in a list in said<br>
second buffer memory 243 on a row corresponding to the difference of FSN and<br>
FSNNEXT. For instance, in case of extracted LLC sequence numbers, if said difference is<br>
3, then the "next packet" will be stored on the 3:rd row in this list, thereby minimizing the<br>
retrieval time when fetching packets from said second buffer memory 243 at a later stage,<br>
since the packets are stored in their correct consecutive order in said list. The re-<br>
sequencing algorithm according to the invention normally limits the required size of said<br>
second memory space of said buffer memory 243. This can be achieved e.g. by defining a<br>
threshold level size of said second memory space of memory 243 and forwarding the<br>
stored in front packet (i.e. the packet with the lowest frame sequence number) from said<br>
second memory space of buffer memory 243 before buffering the "next packet" in step<br>
22<br><br>
5080, if said threshold size have been reached. Another possibility is to buffer the "next<br>
packet" for a defined maximum time period after which the "next packet" is simply being<br>
forwarded to a higher protocol layer/final application. The "next packet" would then be<br>
associated with a specific packet timer when it is stored in the second memory space of<br>
buffer memory 243 and forwarded from said second memory space when said packet<br>
timer elapses (i.e. when the storage time of the "next packet" in said second memory space<br>
exceeds said maximum time period). A person skilled in the art realizes how to realize<br>
such memory limitations. This memory limitation is advantageous since it also hinders the<br>
blocking of the algorithm, as a person skilled in the art realizes. The algorithm then<br>
proceeds to step 5090.<br>
In step 5090, the further next data packet is fetched from the first buffer memory<br>
245, which packet is treated as above "next packet". The algorithm then returns to step<br>
5050.<br>
In step 5100, the second memory space of said second buffer memory 243 is<br>
searched in order to find a consecutive data packet, or a cluster of consecutive packets, of<br>
the "last forwarded packet" (e.g. forwarded to a real time VoIP application). The search is<br>
carried out by checking the (suitable) respective frame sequence number of the stored<br>
packets, and comparing these with the frame sequence number of the "last forwarded<br>
packet". If such a consecutive packet is found, or a cluster of such consecutive packets,<br>
this packet, or cluster of packets, is/are forwarded to a higher protocol/final application<br>
(e.g. a real time application such as VoIP) in step 5110 and the corresponding "latest"<br>
frame sequence number of the last forwarded packet is stored in the second memory space<br>
of said second buffer memory 243, i.e. FSN is updated accordingly, and the algorithm<br>
continues to step 5090. If no such a consecutive packet is found, or a cluster of such<br>
consecutive packets are found, after having searched through the second buffer memory,<br>
the algorithm then proceeds to step 5090. Since the receiver, i.e. the higher layer<br>
protocol/final application of UT 240, thus receives less packets out of order in this way,<br>
the invention reduces the number of necessary re-transmissions and interference level in<br>
the network and also reduces the risk of a reduced data rate, e.g. in the case of a TCP<br>
communication session, at least in a statistical sense. Since the invention reduces packet<br>
delay during handover, it is particularly advantageous for real time applications, such as<br>
e.g. VoIP, especially if an authentication procedure is to be carried out during the<br>
handover, such as an EAP procedure between UT 240 and AP2,220.<br>
23<br><br>
The method and algorithm according to the present invention is normally realized<br>
by means of software programs comprising code means which, when loaded in the<br>
processing means 252,212,222 and 242 of the AR 250, API, 210, AP2,220 and UT 240<br>
realize said method and/or algorithm. The software programs may be stored on e.g. CD-<br>
ROMs, flash memories, etc. allowing an efficient distribution/installation.The principles of<br>
the present invention have been described in the foregoing by examples of embodiments<br>
or modes/examples of operations, i.e. in the case of a WLAN. However, as already stated,<br>
the invention is applicable for any radio access network and many modifications and/or<br>
combinations are possible. Therefore, the invention should not be construed as being<br>
limited to the particular embodiments/working examples discussed above, and it should be<br>
appreciated that variations may be made in those embodiments/working examples by<br>
