The invention relates to a machine part of spinning machines, in particular drawframes, cards or combing machines, the machine part and fibre material to be processed in the machine coming into contact with one another when the machine is in operation. The invention relates, furthermore, to a spinning machine having such a machine part.<br>
Many machine parts of this type are to be found, for example, in drawframes or cards. Examples which may be mentioned here are sliver guide plates, nonwoven funnels, sliver ducts and turntables. The particular problem is addressed below in terms of the explicit example of a turntable. The turntable in this case follows the drawing mechanism of the drawframe, out of which the drawn fibre sliver is taken up by means of calender rollers and is introduced into a sliver duct which is fastened in the turntable. The outlet of the sliver duct issues on the underside of the turntable, the said underside running in a horizontal plane. The drawn fibre sliver is deposited from the outlet of the sliver duct in loops onto the vertically movable can plate of a spinning can placed under the turntable. In order to obtain an optimum degree of filling of the can, along with an actuated deposited fibre sliver, in this case both the turntable and the spinning can having a round cross section rotate about their longitudinal or vertical axes which are offset horizontally with respect to one another. The underside of the turntable has a sheet-like design, in order to exert pressure on the fibre sliver deposited in the can, the counterpressure from the fibre sliver being generated by means of compression springs arranged underneath the can plate or by virtue of external Lifting means engaging on the can plate. In the event<br><br>
that sliver is deposited into a spinning can having a rectangular cross section, there is the essential difference, as compared with a round can, that the rectangular can is moved to and fro (traversed) in the can longitudinal direction, whilst the fixed turntable continues to rotate above the can.<br>
One disadvantage of the known turntables is that, because of the necessary pressure of the turntable on the upper fibre sliver loops, the latter are often displaced in the horizontal direction during the rotation of the turntable.<br>
In general, with regard to the machine parts of the type mentioned in the introduction, there is the problem that their surface and the fibre material are not optimally coordinated with one another, for example in terms of their frictional properties.<br>
The object of the present invention is to develop the machine part of the type mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that contact which is improved with regard to the operating conditions is implemented between the machine part and the fibre material.<br>
In the case of the machine part of the type mentioned in the introduction, this object is achieved in that that surface of the machine part which comes into contact with the fibre sliver has at least partially a three-dimensional structure with elevations and depressions. In the case of a spinning machine, this object is achieved by the use of such a machine part.<br>
The advantages of the invention are, in particular, that the machine part, in particular, does not have a planar design, but has at least partially a three-dimensional structure with elevations and depressions. In this way, in particular, more favourable frictional conditions can be achieved between the machine part and<br><br>
the fibre sliver. For example, the contact face between the machine part and the fibre sliver can be made smaller than in the known machine parts. It is appropriate, in particular, for the structure according to the invention on the surface of the machine part to have a regular design.<br>
According to the invention, advantageously, constituents of, for example, reviving agents, with which textile material to be drawn has been treated, in order to give it a desired softness or a desired gloss, can settle in the depressions, if these are made correspondingly large or deep. The reviving agents are, as a rule, surface-active substances or preparations of these with oils and fats. A lubricating film which forms in time on the machine part on account of these agents can be influenced by means of the invention in such a way that the reviving agents settle essentially first in the depressions of the three-dimensional structure. In order to prevent a continuous lubricating film from forming after a particular time, it is appropriate, from time to time, to clean the surface of the machine part, depending on the textile material used. By virtue of the refinement according to the invention, the cleaning cycles can be substantially longer than in the prior art.<br>
Due to a linear sliding movement of the fibre sliver along the machine part (for example, in the case of sliver guide plates) or to the rotational movement of the turntable during the depositing of the sliver, shear forces act on a lubricating film which forms possibly slowly on the machine part, in the case of the turntable the said shear forces resulting, for example, from the uppermost sliver loops deposited in the can. These forces cause the lubricating-film constituents to creep into the said depressions. The lubricating-film particles are therefore transported into the grooves or<br><br>
depressions during the relative movement of the machine part in relation to the fibre sliver.<br>
The abovementioned benefits of a depositing of dirt and/or of lubricating film in the depressions can be achieved particularly when the said depressions have a depth in the millimetre range. The depth is in this case measured in relation to the highest point of the elevations. The elevations are advantageously visible and have an extent or a diameter (in the plane of extent of the machine part) preferably in the millimetre range. The term "millimetre range" covers elevations of submillimetre size (but not lying in the nano range) and also above one millimetre. In an advantageous embodiment, the diameter of each elevation is approximately between 1 and 20 mm and, also preferably, between 5 and 10 mm; an embodiment of this type can be implemented relatively simply in production terms. According to a preferred embodiment, the edges of the elevations may merge directly into one another or lie closely next to one another, the depressions being arranged in their transitional or boundary region.<br>
Particularly preferably, the coarser structure formed in the millimetre range is designed as an arched structure with bellied arches or elevations and with depressions arranged between these. In this case, with regard to a turntable, according to an advantageous embodiment the arches or elevations point towards the fibre sliver deposited in the can. In addition to the production benefits to be described further below, such an arched structure is appropriate because, by means of this configuration, sharp edges or corners which could damage the sensitive fibre sliver structure of the upper sliver layers are avoided.<br>
In advantageous embodiments of the invention, the structure has part-spherical or honeycombed elevations.<br><br>
•rnese strutures can contribute to fulfilling the said requirements to a great extent.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the selected structure according to the invention is so small that the machine surface has a repelling action, in particular with respect to water and small particles, for example even individual fibres. Such a structure has what is referred to as the lotus effect known from nature, that is to say an aqueous liquid film and/or, for example, dirt particles or individual fibres cannot settle permanently on the surface of the machine part, since the depressions of the structure include air and, for example, water droplets trickle off due to their resulting surface tension. Even dirt particles or individual fibres lie only on the tips of the structure and can be removed by the action of very slight force. A nanostructure of this kind can therefore be used even on surfaces of machine parts on which no fibre material slides along, but on which, for example, fibre fly settles.<br>
It is also possible to implement a combination of the said coarser and finer structures, for example in such a way that, with regard to a turntable, the underside of the latter acquires a coarser visible structure, these structures themselves having hydrophobic nanostructures.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment already mentioned, the machine part is designed as a turntable. When the invention is applied to the underside of the turntable, the contour of the elevations and the depressions can be optimized, for example, in such a way as to ensure, on the one hand, a uniform pressure on the fibre sliver column, without any local impairment of the uppermost fibre sliver loops, and, on the other hand, a sufficient uptake of lubricating film in the depressions. The structures selected may in this<br><br>
case be so small that the local pressure of the arches onto the' fibre sliver deposited directly below them does not lead to a deformation caused by the arched structure. A displacement of the sliver mushroom can thus largely be avoided. The extents of the relevant structures are preferably in the millimetre range and are not to be confused with the nanostructures for achieving the lotus effect.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the turntable, the latter conprises a basic body and a sheet-like cover fastened to the basic body on the underside. Such a thin-walled cover consisting of high-grade steel is known from EP 0 670 281 Bl. In the case of such a cover, particularly preferably, its underside is provided at least partially with a three-dimensional structure according to the invention. In addition to the known advantage that a thin cover of this type consisting of high-grade steel incurs substantially lower production costs than a solid high-grade steel version of the turntable, the production of the said three-dimensional structure advantageously with an elevation diameter (diameter of the elevations pointing towards the deposited fibre sliver, in the plane of the turntable surface) in the millimetre range, particularly in the range of approximately 5 to 10 mm, is relatively simple in the case of such a cover. The edges of the elevations are in this case advantageously contiguous to one another.<br>
For this purpose, advantageously, the cover is supported on one of its two sides by a correspondingly structured core, whilst the other side is acted upon by pressure, so that the structures according to the invention are obtained. In the case of an arched structuring of this kind, high dimensional stability and high strength of the cover are achieved. This may be advantageous particularly for fastening the cover to the basic body. Advantageously, the cover is adhesivelv<br><br>
bonded to the basic body and/or screwed to the latter and/or rolled with a projecting edge in a round slot on the basic body. The high dimensional stability and high strength prevent the situation, particularly during adhesive bonding and during rolling-in, where the cover lifts off from the basic body during the use life of the machine and may thus have an adverse influence on the depositing of the fibre sliver.<br>
Moreover, the said method for producing a relatively coarse structure of the cover (not suitable for achieving the lotus effect) affords the advantage, as compared with rolling methods, that the stretching of the material is relatively low. Moreover, the surface quality of the cover is not affected. Thus, for example, it is possible first to apply the nanostructures in order to achieve the lotus effect and thereafter to use the arched-structure method described, without the nanostructure being destroyed thereby.<br>
The abovementioned statements regarding the production of a structure according to the invention in the case of a cover of a turntable can be transferred correspondingly to a sheet-like machine part according to the invention (for example, a sliver guide plate) or to a different surface cover of low height as a component of a machine part.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the machine part according to the invention is designed as a sliver duct, the inner surface of which has at least partially a three-dimensional structure with elevations and depressions. By means of the said structure, advantageous frictional conditions, which contribute to the care of the fibre sliver, can be achieved between the sliver-duct surface and the fibre sliver. If appropriate, it is even possible to reduce the number<br><br>
or frequency of fibre accumulations in dead regions in the sliver duct (what may be referred to as mice).<br>
It is, of course, not ruled out that a coarser structure according to the invention may also be produced by conventional rolling.<br>
A material which has proved advantageous for the surface of the machine part according to the invention, for example of the cover, is, in particular, high-grade steel, for example chrome steel. The sliding and frictional properties of high-grade steel in terms of the care of the fibre sliver are very good. A polishing of the surface before or after the application of the structure is, depending on the structuring, advantageous. Use of aluminium or aluminium compounds as material for the machine part or its surface is likewise advantageous.<br>
The three-dimensional structure exhibiting the lotus effect can be provided by means of an applied layer which, together with the carrier material, can have the regular coarser structure in the millimetre range. It is appropriate, in this case, that the structured layer be a hard-chrome layer. Such a layer has high hardness, but, on the other hand, also ensures careful fibre contact.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are characterized by the features of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to the figures. These deal particularly with a turntable as an example of a machine part. However, this does not entail any restriction. The statements can also be transferred accordingly to other machine parts, the surfaces of which are in sliding contact with a fibre sliver. In the figures:<br><br>
Figure 1  shows a turntable and a spinning can in longitudinal section;<br>
Figure 2  shows a side view of a detail of a basic body of a turntable with a cover;<br>
Figure 3  shows a side view of a second embodiment of a cover on an underside of a basic body, and<br>
Figure 4  shows  a  detail  of  a  turntable  with  a honeycombed structure, seen from below.<br>
Figure 1 shows a section through a turntable 1, known from EP 0 670 281 Bl, with a three-dimensional curved sliver duct 10 which has an entrance 13 and an exit 14. Fibre sliver, coming from a preceding drawing mechanism (not illustrated) , enters the sliver duct 10 at the entrance 13, runs through the sliver duct 10 and emerges again at its exit 14, in order to be deposited into a spinning can 20, illustrated only partially, which is placed under the turntable 1. The entrance 13 of the sliver duct 10 is arranged in the turntable 1 centrally in relation to the turntable longitudinal axis 19. A casting compound 11 connects the sliver duct 10 to a plate holder 2 of the turntable 1, this ensuring an accurate positioning and positional stability of the sliver duct 10. The sliver duct 10 is fixed at its exit 14, by means of a casting compound 12, to a basic body 3, connected to the plate holder 2, of the turntable 1, in order to ensure a gap-free transition between the sliver duct 10 and the turntable 1 on the underside of the latter. The basic body 3 consists, for example, of cast aluminium.<br>
The turntable 1 comprises, furthermore, a thin cover 4 which is preferably manufactured from polished high-grade sheet steel. The cover 4 may be adhesively bonded to the basic body 3. Alternatively or additionally, the cover 4 has, on its side facing the basic body 3,<br><br>
threaded bolts, not illustrated, which are screwed to the basic body 3. In a further embodiment not illustrated in any more detail, the cover 4 may be bent round circumferentially towards the basic body 3 and rolled in an annular slot of the basic body 3.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a detail of a configuration according to the invention of the cover 4 on the underside of the basic body 3. The cover 4 has a planar topside 4a which is directed towards the basic body 3 and, for example, is adhesively bonded to the basic body 3. The basic body 3 and the cover 4 accordingly rest flat against one another. On the side 4b facing away from the basic body 3, the cover 4 has a three-dimensional regular structure 5 according to the invention. According to the embodiment of Figure 2, the structure 5 consists of part-spherical elevations or arches 6 with depressions 8 lying between them. The advantageously in each case identical height difference between the elevations 6 and the depressions 8 is in the millimetre range, for example between 0.5 and 3 mm. The extent of the elevations 6 or their diameter is, for example, between 5 and 10 mm.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 3 differs from that of Figure 2 in that that side 4a of the cover 4 which faces the basic body 3 is also structured three-dimensionally. The elevations 6 of the cover 4 on its topside and underside 4a, 4b run parallel to one another and are formed convexly towards the spinning can 20.<br>
The cover 4 according to Figure 3 is relatively simple to produce, in that the underside 4b of the cover 4 is laid over a core having a plurality of circular clearances with equal spacing and is pressed hydraulically onto the core from the topside 4a. The sheet steel is in this case pressed locally through the<br><br>
respective clearances, with the result that the part-spherical structure 5 is obtained.<br>
The cover 4 according to Figure 3 may be fastened to the basic body 3 by means of the abovementioned screwing and/or by being rolled in circumferentially. Other known fastening possibilities are likewise possible.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 4. This shows a detail of a round cover 4 from its underside 4b, as seen in the direction of the turntable 1. The cover 4 is provided, at least on its underside 4b, with a honeycombed structure 5, of which the arches or elevations 7 (only part of the structure 5 is illustrated for the sake of simplicity) point towards the spinning can 2 0 (Figure 1) . Depressions 8 run between the elevations 7. The elevations 7 and depressions 8 have dimensions which again lie in the millimetre range. Such a structure of the cover 4 may be obtained, for example, in that the sheet is laid over a core consisting of a plurality of flexible rings at equal intervals and is pressed hydraulically onto the core from outside. The arches 7 are in this case formed without pressing-in by means of corresponding geometric forming tools being necessary, and without the material being subjected to pronounced stretching. A highly dimensionally stable sheet stiffened by the elevations 7 is thus obtained.<br>
The structuring according to the invention of the underside of the turntable 1, be it a structuring of the basic body 3 or of a cover 4 placed onto the latter, is selected such that the cover 4 slides without damage to the fibre sliver loops located under it and deposited on the can plate of the can 20. The pressure force from the turntable 1 onto the fibre sliver column is in this case essentially unchanged, as compared with the known turntables. The structure 5 on<br><br>
the under side of the turntable 1 also has the advantage, in comparision to the prior art, that solid particles and/or a liquid film, in particular a lubricating film consisting of textile treatment agents, can accumulate in the depressions 8, if these are selected to be relatively large, preferably in the millimetre range. The influence of the lubricating film or of smaller particles on the depositing of a fibre sliver is minimal in these depressions 8. It is merely necessary to clean the structure 5 from time to time. The transport of the lubricating film, for example generated by reviving agents, into the depressions 8 is assisted by the shear forces acting on them when the turntable 1 slides horizontally over the uppermost fibre sliver loops. Overall, a more careful and more accurate depositing of the sliver is achieved.<br>
Another advantage of the turntable 1 according to the invention is that the contact face between the turntable and the deposited fibre sliver can be kept smaller. Overall, better sliding-friction conditions are possible. The displacement in position of the fibre sliver or of the sliver mushroom due to the turntable sliding over it can thereby be minimized.<br>
Whilst the above advantages relate preferably to coarser structures, preferably with individual structures or elevations and depressions in the millimetre range, alternatively or additionally a substantially finer structuring of the surface of the turntable underside may be provided, in order to achieve what is known as the lotus effect, that is to say making the surface hydrophobic, in order to prevent a depositing of an essentially aqueous liquid film and/or of particles, including individual fibres. Moreover, a surface of this type for achieving the lotus effect may also be employed in the case of machine parts of any kind of spinning machines which have no sliding contact with a fibre sliver. In this<br>
13<br><br>
way, for example, fibre deposits in the machine can be reduced, which would otherwise lead to a gradual clogging with fly of, in particular, the interior of the machine. Owing to the lotus effect, relatively low suction forces are sufficient to detach fibres from machine-part surfaces treated in this way and to remove them.<br>
The invention can be applied advantageously to virtually all machine parts with a surface which is in sliding contact with fibre sliver, whether the machine part slides along the fibre sliver and/or conversely. These include, in addition to the turntable described in more detail with reference to the figures, for example, also sliver guide surfaces, nonwoven funnels for sliver forming at the exit of the drawing mechanism and also mechanical sensors, along which one or more fibre slivers slide and which are deflected out of their position of rest, preferably according to the fibre-sliver thickness. Also, alternatively or additionally, the sliver duct illustrated in Figure 1 may have a coarser and/or finer structuring of its inner surface, in order to optimize the sliding-friction effects and/or to influence or prevent the depositing of a lubricating film, of water and/or of particles.<br><br><br>
