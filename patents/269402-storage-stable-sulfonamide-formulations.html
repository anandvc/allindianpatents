Description<br>
Storage-stable sulphonamide formulations<br>
The present invention relates to the field of crop protection compositions. In particular, the invention relates to storage-stable solid herbicide formulations which comprise herbicidally active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides and their salts, in particular phenylsulfonamides, such as phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyl-triazolinones or phenylsulfonylureas, heteroarylsulfonamides and other sulfonamides and their salts.<br>
In general, active compounds for crop protection are not employed in pure form. Depending on the area of use and the type of use, and on physical, chemical and biological parameters, the active compound is used as an active compound formulation in a mixture with customary auxiliaries and additives. Also known are combinations with further active compounds for widening the activity spectrum and/or for protecting crop plants (for example by safeners, antidotes).<br>
In general, formulations of active compounds for crop protection should have high chemical and physical stability, should be easy to apply and easy to use and have broad biological action combined with high selectivity.<br>
Solid formulations of active compounds from the group of the sulfonylureas are known per se, for example from WO-A-97/10714.<br>
in general, herbicidally active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides have high chemical reactivity and tend to undergo chemical degradation, for example by hydrolysis- With respect to a sufficient storage stability of the formulations, this has to be judged critical, and the particular storage temperatures to be expected in the intended markets also have to be taken into account.<br><br>
A stabilization of sulfonylureas comprised in solid formulations is described, for example, in JP-A-62-084004, where calcium carbonate and Na tripolyphosphate are added as stabilizers. However, in addition the formulations for their part, owing to the auxiliaries and additives comprised therein, may also affect the stability of the active compounds.<br>
WO-A-98/34482 describes results of tests with the phenylsulfonylureas tritosulfuron and metsulfuron according to which additives (adjuvants) from the group of the fatty alcohol ethoxylates and the ethoxylated fatty amines result in lower storage stability than adjuvants from the group of the sodium salts of the aliphatic sulfonic acids, such as Na alkanesulfonates and Na alpha-olefinsulfonates. EP-A-764404 describes a stabilization of the heteroarylsulfonylurea flazasulfuron using Na dioctylsulfo-succinate.<br>
However, corresponding stability studies with active compounds from the group of the phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones alone and in mixtures with other active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides are not known. In the applicant's tests, it was found that in particular wetting agents, such as anionic wetting agents from the group of the alkyl sulfates and alkyl sulfonates and also nonionic wetting agents from the group of the alkyl alkoxylates, which are routinely used in formulations of crop protection agents, may result in an instability of active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide an improved solid formulation of crop protection agents, which permits a high storage stability of active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides and, in addition, has unchanged high biological effectiveness and crop plant compatibility.<br>
This object is achieved by the solid water-dispersible formulation according to the present invention.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a solid water-dispersibie formulation comprising:<br>
(a)	one or more active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides and their<br>
salts, with at least one active compound from the group of the<br>
phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones,<br>
(b)	one or more carrier materials,<br>
where<br>
(c)	one or more wetting agents from the group of the naphthalenesulfonic acids and<br>
the group of the sulfosuccinic acid derivatives and the salts of these groups<br>
are used.<br>
In addition, the solid water-dispersibie formulation according to the invention may, as further components, optionally also comprise:<br>
(d)	further customary auxiliaries and additives,<br>
(e)	one or more safeners, and<br>
(e-1) solvents, (e-2) emulsifiers and (e-3) carrier materials required, if appropriate, for the safener addition,<br>
(f)	one or more agrochemically active compounds different from (a) and (e).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention consists in the use of at least two or more active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides and their salts (component a), preferably with active compounds from the group of the phenylsulfonamides, such as phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones or phenylsulfonylureas.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention consists in the use of at least two or more active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides and their salts (component a), preferably with active compounds from the group of the phenylsulfonamides, such as phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones or<br><br>
phenylsulfonylureas, and of one or more safeners (component e) and the solvents (component e-1), emulsifiers (component e-2) and carrier materials (component e-3) required, if appropriate, for the safener addition.<br>

The sulfonamides are commercially available and/or can be prepared by known processes, as described, for example, in EP-A-7687, EP-A-30138, US 5,057,144 and US 5,534,486.<br>

For the purpose of the present invention, the sulfonamides (component a) contained in the solid, water-dispersible formulations according to the invention are in each case to be understood as meaning all use forms, such as acids, esters, salts and isomers, such as stereoisomers and optical isomers. Thus, in addition to neutral compounds, their salts with inorganic and/or organic counterions are in each case meant to be included. Thus, sulfonamides are capable of forming salts, for example, in which the hydrogen of the -SO2-NH group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Salt formation may also take place by addition of an acid to basic groups, such as, for example, amino and alkylamino. Acids suitable for this purpose are strong inorganic and organic acids, for example HCI, HBr, H2SO4 or HNO3. Preferred esters are the alkyl esters, in particular the C1-C10)-alkyl esters, such as methyl esters.<br>

formulations according to the invention may be 0.1 - 70% by weight, preferably 0.3 -50% by weight, particularly preferably 0.5 - 30% by weight.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a herbicidal composition which may be prepared from the formulations according to the invention by dilution with liquids, preferably water.<br>
It may be advantageous to add to the herbicidal compositions obtained in this manner further active compounds, preferably agrochemically active compounds (for example as tank mixing partners in the form of corresponding formulations) and/or auxiliaries and additives customary for application, for example self-emulsifying oils, such as vegetable oils or paraffin oils, and/or fertilizers. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to such compositions, preferably herbicidal compositions, based on the formulations according to the invention.<br>
A particular embodiment of the invention relates to the use of the herbicidal compositions, obtainable from the formulations according to the invention, for controlling unwanted vegetation, hereinbelow referred to as "herbicidal composition*'.<br>
The herbicidal compositions have outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. Even perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, rootstocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control are controlled well. In this context, it does not matter whether the herbicidal compositions are applied before sowing, pre-emergence or post-emergence. Specific examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the herbicidal compositions, without the enumeration being a restriction to certain species.<br>
Examples of weed species on which the herbicidal compositions act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledonous weed species, Apera spica venti, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Brachiaria spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp.,<br><br>
Panicum spp., Phalaris spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp, and Bromus spp. such as Bromus catharticus, Bromus secalinus, Bromus erectus, Bromus tectorum and Bromus japonicus, and Cyperus species from the annual group, and, among the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species. In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to genera such as, for example, Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp.. Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp. such as Galium aparine, Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp.. Polygonum spp., Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum spp., Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp., among the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds.<br>
The compositions according to the invention also act outstandingly efficiently on harmful plants which are found under the specific cultures in rice, such as, for example, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions are applied to the soil surface before germination, the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging or else the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage, but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth likewise stops drastically a very short time after the treatment, and the weed plants remain at the growth stage of the point of time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated very early and in a sustained manner.<br>
The herbicidal compositions are distinguished by a rapidly commencing and long-lasting herbicidal action. As a rule, the rainfastness of the active substances in the herbicidal compositions Is advantageous. A particular advantage is that the dosages used in the herbicidal compositions and the effective dosages of herbicidal<br><br>
compounds can be adjusted to such a low level that their soil action is optimally low. This does not only allow them to be employed in sensitive crops in the first place, but groundwater contaminations are virtually avoided. The active compound combination according to the invention allows the required application rate of the active substances to be reduced considerably.<br>
The abovementioned properties and advantages are necessary for weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesired competing plants, and thus to ensure and/or increase yield levels from the qualitative and quantitative angle. These novel herbicidal compositions markedly exceed the technical state of the art with a view to the properties described.<br>
While the herbicidal compositions have an outstanding herbicidal activity against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops, for example dicotyledonous crops such as soya, cotton, oilseed rape, sugarbeet, or graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice or corn, are damaged only to a minor extent, if at all This is why the present herbicidal compositions are highly suitable for the selective control of undesired plant growth in plantations of agricultural crops or of ornamentals.<br>
In addition, the corresponding herbicidal compositions have outstanding growth-regulatory properties in crop plants. They engage in the plants' metabolism in a regulatory manner and can thus be employed for provoking direct effects on plant constituents and to facilitate harvesting such as, for example, by triggering desiccation and stunted growth. Moreover, they are also suitable for the general control and inhibition of undesired vegetative growth without simultaneously destroying the plants. Inhibition of vegetative growth is very important in a large number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can thus be reduced, or prevented completely.<br>
Owing to their herbicidal and plant-growth-regulatory properties, the herbicidal compositions can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of<br><br>
genetically modified plants which are known or yet to be developed. As a rule, the recombinant plants are distinguished by specific advantageous characteristics, for example by resistances to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistances to plant diseases or the causative organisms of plant diseases such as specific insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other specific characteristics relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storability, composition and specific constituents. Thus, for example, transgenic plants are known whose starch content is increased, or whose starch quality is altered, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the herbicidal compositions in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example of graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice and corn, or else crops of sugarbeet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables, is preferred. Preferably, the herbicidal compositions can be employed in crops of useful plants which resist the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides, or have been made to resist these effects by recombinant techniques.<br>
When using the herbicidal compositions in transgenic crops, effects are frequently observed in addition to the effects against harmful plants to be observed in other crops, which are specific for the application in the transgenic crop in question, for example a modified or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, modified application rates which may be employed for application, preferably good combining ability with the further herbicidally acitve compounds to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and an effect on growth and yield level of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a method for controlling undesired vegetation, preferably in crops of plants such as cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, corn and millet), sugar beet, sugar cane, oilseed rape, cotton and soya, especially preferred in monocotyledonous plants such as cereals, for example<br><br>
wheat, barley, rye, oats, and their hybrids such as triticale, rice, com and millet, wherein the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the harmful plants, plant parts, seeds of the plants or the area on which the plants grow, for example the area under cultivation.<br>
The plant crops may also be genetically modified or have been obtained by mutation selection; they preferably tolerate acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors.<br>
The process for preparing the formulations according to the invention can be selected from a number of processes known per se which permit the preparation of solid fonnulatlons, such as water-dispersible powders (WP), granules (WG), and compacted products preparable therefrom, such as flakes, tablets, etc. From among these processes, preference is given to extrusion, pan and fluidized bed granulation, particularly preferably fluidized bed granulation. Common to all processes is that the Individual components are combined In the respective ratios, as a result of the preparation.<br>
The formulations according to the invention have excellent chemical stability during preparation and storage and are suitable in particular also for combinations of active compounds having different physicochemical properties. In addition, the formulations according to the invention have excellent physical stability, are easy to apply and easy to use and have high biological effectiveness and selectivity.<br>
The pH for the formulations according to the invention, for example in 10% strength aqueous solution, is generally between 7 and 8.<br>
Altogether, the formulations according to the invention have the desired long-term storage stability and can be applied without any problems.<br>

compounds described therein.<br>
Preparation process 1:<br>
The individual components in the respective ratios are dissolved or dispersed in water. The mixture formed is, using a fluidized-bed granulator, converted into water-soluble granules which, after granulation, have a predefined residual amount of water.<br>
Preparation process 2:<br>
The individual components are mixed in the respective ratios. The mixture formed is, using an air jet mill, ground finely and then moistened with about 5% water. This moistened material is subjected to extrusion granulation using a dome extruder, for example a perforated dome having perforations of the width of 0.5 - 0.8 mm. The moist granules are then air-dried until their residual water content corresponds to the value defined beforehand.<br>
In preparation process 2, for example, safeners are, as optional component (e), applied with the solvents (component e-1) and emulsifiers (component e-2) also to be used optionally to the carrier material (component e-3), and as a first process step, a flowable absorbate is prepared, which is then mixed with the other formulation components.<br>
The examples shown in tables 1 and 2 were prepared using the preparation process 2 (residual water content: about 1% by weight).<br><br>
Description of the products used in the examples:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
examples 1 - 4) which employ wetting agents (analogous to component c) from chemically different groups, such as ®exapon K12 (Na iauryl sulfate), ®Genapol X060-methyl (tridecyl alcohol ethoxylate methyl ether) and ®Hostapur OSB (Na alpha-olefinsulfonate) which are very customary for formulating crop protection agents (prior art).<br><br><br>
Table 3 summarizes the respective chemical stabilities of the formulations introduced in tables 1 (prior art) and 2 (according to the invention) in a comparative manner. In each case, the stability criterion used was the chemical degradation of the active sulfonamide compounds present after 2 weeks of storage at a temperature of 54oC (method similar to the CIPAC MT 46 method).<br><br><br>
The data in table 3 clearly show that the use of the wetting agents according to the invention (examples 5-8) results in a stabilization of active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides in formulations, compared to the wetting agents of the prior art (examples 1-4).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
