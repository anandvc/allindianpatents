The invention relates to an electrical switchgear enclosure comprising a back plate, at least one support in the form of a rail to receive electrical switchgear apparatuses, and means for holding the support in the back plate of the enclosure.<br>
Known switchgear enclosures comprise a back plate and walls on which one or more supports are fixed. The supports are generally symmetrical rails secured to the back plate or on the walls by fixing screws. Modular electrical switchgear apparatuses are fixed onto the rails by removable fixing devices.<br>
The supports must be able to be adjusted horizontally in the enclosures to achieve a good alignment of the front faces of said enclosures. It is known to use fixing devices with variable positions to hold the supports.<br>
These fixings are generally rigid and do not enable quick alignment of the supports.<br>
For certain installations, electrical switchgear apparatuses are fitted and wired on the support, before the support is itself fixed in the enclosure. In this case fitting and fixing of the support are not achieved easily, particularly when the support is equipped with a large number of switchgear apparatuses.<br>
The object of the invention is to achieve an electrical switchgear enclosure enabling quick and easy fixing of the electrical switchgear supports.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by the fact that the securing means comprise:<br>
-	first fixing means situated on the back plate appreciably towards a first end of the support to immobilise the support in all directions,<br>
-	second fixing means situated on the back plate appreciably towards a second end of the support opposite the first end to block the perpendicular movements of the support with respect to the back plate,<br>
-	third fixing means situated on the back plate between the first and second fixing<br>
means to block the translation movements of the support with respect to the back<br>
plate and allowing rotational movements around an axis perpendicular to said back<br>
plate.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment the first fixing means comprise a raised part fixedly<br>
secured to the back plate designed to receive a fixing screw.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the third fixing means are fixedly secured to<br>
the back plate and have a shape having a first part of broad cross-section between<br>
the back plate and the  support and a second part of narrow cross-section<br>
penetrating into the support.   The third fixing means are located at a distance<br>
appreciably midway between the first and second fixing means.<br>
Preferably, the second fixing means are fixedly secured to the back plate and have<br>
the form of a slide covering a lower part and an upper part of the support, the lower<br>
part being directed towards the back plate of the enclosure and the upper part<br>
directed towards the front face of the enclosure.<br>
The support comprises at least at one end an oblong drilled hole perpendicular to<br>
the back plate of the enclosure and in a central part a circular drilled hole to<br>
cooperate with the third fixing means. The support is preferably a symmetrical rail.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an electrical switchgear enclosure comprising a back plate, at least one support in the form of a rail to receive electrical switchgear apparatuses, and securing means for securing the support in the back plate of the enclosure, an enclosure characterized in that the securing means comprising first fixing means situated on the back plate towards a first end of the support for immobilising the support in all directions; second fixing means situated on the back plate towards a second end of the support opposite the first end for blocking the perpendicular movements of the support with respect to the back plate and third fixing means situated on the back plate between the first and second fixing means for blocking the translation movements of the support with respect to the back plate and allowing rotational movements around an axis perpendicular to said back plate.<br><br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of an enclosure according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a support able to be fitted in an enclosure according to figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows an enclosure according to figure 1 provided with a support according to figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 and 5 show front views of an enclosure according to figure 1 with a support fitted in two different positions.<br>
An enclosure according to an embodiment of the invention is represented in figure 1. The enclosure comprises a back plate 1 and walls 2. On the back plate close to a first wall, a first fixing device 3 comprises a raised part 4 and an orifice 5 designed to_<br><br>
receive a fixing screw. A second fixing device 6, arranged on the back plate close to a second wall opposite the first one, has the form of a slide. Between the first and second fixing devices, a third fixing device 7 is arranged on the back plate of the enclosure. The third fixing device comprises a base 8 of broad cross-section and a circular-shaped pin 9 of narrow cross-section.<br>
Figure 2 shows a support 10 in the form of a symmetrical rail designed to be held inside the enclosure by the three fixing devices 3, 6 and 7. The support 10 comprises near its ends at least one oblong drilled hole 11 and in its central part, in the middle with respect to the ends, a circular drilled hole. The central part can be stamped and be located on a different plane from the plane of the oblong holes.<br>
Figure 3 shows the fitting of the support 10 in the enclosure. A first end of the support is slid into the second fixing device 6 in the form of a slide. The slide holds, at the first end, a face of the support directed towards the back plate and a face of the support directed towards the front face of the enclosure. The second device fixing 6 blocks the support in its movements perpendicular to the back plate 1.<br>
The central part of the support is flush-mounted in the third fixing device 7. The pin 7 passes through the circular hole 12. This fixing device blocks the translation movements parallel to the back plate 1 and allows rotation of the rail around an axis perpendicular to the back plate materialised by the pin 7.<br>
The first fixing device 3 enables the support 10 to be immobilised in all directions. A screw 13 passes through the oblong hole of a second end of the support. The oblong hole enables the positioning to be adjusted, according to a plane parallel to the back plate of the enclosure. When positioning is performed, a simple tightening of the single screw 13 enables the support to be immobilised in the enclosure.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show views of the support 10 in the enclosure. In figure 4 the support 10 is pivoted, around the pin 9, in a maximum position. The orifice 5 appears at the edge of the oblong hole 11.<br>
In figure 5, the support 10 is in a middle position, the longitudinal axis of the rail acting as support is appreciably perpendicular to vertical walls 2V and parallel to horizontal walls 2H. The orifice 5 appears appreciably in the middle of the oblong hole 11.<br><br>
The enclosure of figures 1 to 5 comprises a single support, but other embodiments of the enclosures according to the invention may comprise several supports.<br>
The three fixing devices are preferably made of plastic material and moulded with the back plate 1 of the enclosure.<br>
In the embodiment described above, the support is a symmetrical rail but other forms of support are possible. The support may be made of metal or of plastic material.<br><br><br>
