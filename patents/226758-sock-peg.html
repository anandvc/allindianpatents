				<td>HELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a garment clamp for clamping pairs of garments, such as<br>
socks, tights or stockings together for storage or washing, drying or other processing.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The following description of the prior art is not intended to be, nor should it be<br>
interpreted as, an indication, of file common general knowledge.<br>
A perennial and universal problem is the separation of members of pairs of garments<br>
during washing, drying and the like. Attempts to address this problem by providing &amp;<br>
suitable damping device have been described.<br>
in US 5,671,876 (Gardiner) a sock organiser in the form of a tong-like moulded<br>
plastic clamp is described. The device described has a pair of gripping members connected<br>
by an integral hinge. The device is adapted for keeping together a plurality of pairs of<br>
garments and the difficulty in utilising this device lies in the struggle to align multiple pairs<br>
of garments in place prior to clamping the device together.<br>
US 5,944,236 (Cinque) describes a two-part device having hingeably connected jaws<br>
which may be locked in the clamping position by the application of a separate securing<br>
member. The described clamp cannot be made in one piece and operators would be likely to<br>
experience difficulty in manipulating the part components to successfully secure a pair of<br>
garments.<br>
fa US- 5,357,660 (Smith) there is described a two-part tab bearing a numerical or<br>
other indicia to be attached to each member of a pair of garments to enable the socks to be<br>
matched according to the indicia. It can be seen that this system still permits the separation<br><br>
of members of pairs of garments and still requires sorting and recombining of the members<br>
of pairs subsequent to processing such as washing.<br>
In US 5,3234,139 (Korenstein) there is described a clamp for clamping together pairs<br>
of paired garments such as socks and other textile articles. The hook, described as optional,<br>
is not fully adapted to securely engage a thin diameter clothes line and conceivably may be<br>
dislodged in moderate to strong winds. Moreover, force is required to urge the opposed<br>
arias of the clamp 12, 14 for a positive engagement with the locking means 34, 36.<br>
Accordingly, failure of the locking means 34. 36 will result in the failure of the clamp to<br>
clamp the garment articles.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to' overcome one or more of the<br>
abovemena'oned disadvantages of the prior art or to at least provide a useful alternative<br>
thereto.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an integrally formed clamp including:<br>
an opposed pair of first and second elongate substantially rigid members, the first<br>
elongate member having a first handle- portion and a first clamp portion and the second<br>
elongate member having a second handle portion and a second clamping portion;<br>
a flexible joint intermediate the lengths of the first and second elongate members<br>
configured to urge the first and second clamping portions into abutment; and<br>
locking device,<br>
wherein the locking device has a first end hinged to the first handle portion and<br>
rotateable about the hinge and a second free end adapted to releasably cooperate with the<br>
second handle portion whereby to lock the first and second handle portions in spaced<br>
relationship and the first and second clamping portions is abutting relationship.<br><br>
The clamp is suitable for keeping members of a pair of garments together during<br>
laundry processing, wherein:<br>
in the passive state the first and second clamping portions are urged into abutment<br>
and the first and second handle portions are held in spaced relationship by the flexible joint;<br>
upon compression of the first and second handle portions, the first and second<br>
clamping portions ate forced apart such that the first and second clamping portions are<br>
adapted to receive the pair of garments and to clamp together the garments when the first<br>
and second handle portions are released; and<br>
the abutting clamping portions secure the garments against dislodgment from the<br>
clamp during processing.<br>
The clamp may be made from a variety of materials suitable for the purpose. For<br>
example, the clamp may be made from moulded plastic material. Depending on the type of<br>
process to which the garments are to be subjected, the clamp material should be suitable for<br>
the particular application. For example, where the clamp is to be used to clamp pairs of<br>
garments during washing cycles involving hot water and detergents, the material will of<br>
necessity be heat resistant and chemically resistant sufficiently resistant to detergents to<br>
avoid chemical degradation during the washing cycle. Tt is preferred that the clamp material<br>
be made from polypropylene or similar plastics materials.<br>
The clamp is preferably comprised of a unitary structure integrally formed by, for<br>
example, moulding. Preferably, the moulding process is carried out using an injection<br>
moulding process. As me clamp is preferably, integrally formed whereby each of its<br>
components comprise the same material, the properties of flexibility and rigidity are<br>
generally achieved by the shape or configuration of the various components as determined<br>
by the (the during the moulding process. For example, the elongate members may be<br><br>
reinforced against flexible bending by ribs end other reinforcing structures. The elongate<br>
members may be bow shaded. Hie elongate members may include reinforcing ribs on their<br>
lespective concave sides whereby to resist further bowing. The .length of cure, temperature<br>
conditions, etc are moulding conditions which can be used to modify the clamp's properties.<br>
Accordingly, the joint portion tatty be selectively heat treated or physically weakened by, for<br>
example, applying a notch to the joint, surface, to weaken the joint and permit greater<br>
fl exibili ty subsequent to the moulding process.<br>
Preferably, the clamp does not include metal components and all components of the<br>
clamp are made from non-penetrating materials, bom in terms of material hardness,<br>
consistency and shape, whereby to avoid garment damage associated with penetration and<br>
tearing.<br>
The first and second damping portions may include on their respective inner opposed<br>
surfaces, gripping features, such as staggered or mutually co-operating ribbed, ripple or<br>
undulating surface features. Alternatively, the clamping portion may include opposed<br>
internal tooth features. The features may be directly opposed rather than arranged in mating<br>
relationship. The opposed internal surface features may be similar to traditional clothes peg<br>
gripping surfaces or may be sawtoothed to provide a strong friction grip. In all cases,<br>
however, the internal opposed surface features of the clamping portions should be<br>
sufficiently non-penetrative to avoid tearing or damage to the garments during the washing<br>
cycle or other treatment process.<br>
The joint is preferably sprung whereby a low loading is all that is required to<br>
compress the first and second handles towards one another whereby to achieve a spacing of<br>
the damping portions relative to one another. Where the spring loading of the flexible joint<br>
is low and insufficient in its own right to secure the garments, the locking device prevents<br><br>
the first and second handle portions from being compressed towards one another. The<br>
locking device forcibly spaces the handle portions apart whereby to achieve in the first and<br>
second clamping portions a strong clamping action.<br>
The locking device may be in the form of a bridge flexibly attached to one of the first<br>
and second handles and releasably engageable to the other of the first and second handle<br>
portions. Alternatively, the locking device may be in the form of a wedge or other bracing<br>
element integrally formed with one or other of the first and second handles and adapted to be<br>
inserted therebetween in a frictions! or positively engaging bracing relationship whereby to<br>
prevent the first and second handle portions from being displaced towards one another.<br>
The bridge may include a cam surface adapted to ride over a protrusion on the other<br>
of the first and second handle portions and to futher include a recess adapted to positively<br>
engage the protrusion. Of course, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
protrusion may be on the bridge and tbe cam surface and recess may be on the other of the<br>
first and second handle portions.<br>
To enable the clamp of the invention to be utilised as a clothes peg, the clamp may<br>
further include a clothes line attachment means integrally formed on the external surface of<br>
one of the first and second elongate members. The clothes line attachment means may<br>
include a hook or clip. Preferably the book is sufficiently sprung to permit resilient<br>
deformation whereby to admit the clothes line into a hook recess defined by the hook.<br>
Preferably, the hook recess is sufficiently spatially tight to resist relative movement of the<br>
clamp relative to the clothes line whereby to resist displacement in moderate or high wind<br>
conditions.<br>
The clamp may include indicia on one or more of its components to indicate<br>
ownership (such as in the case of a particular hotel) or the nature of the garments to which<br><br>
the clamp is to be attached. The indicia may be alpha and/or numeric or include some other<br>
symbol types or systems such as braille.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION Of THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
examples in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a sock peg according to one embodiment of the first<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a reverse perspective view of the embodiment shown in Figure I;<br>
Figure 3 is a side view of a bridge included in the first embodiment;<br>
Figure 4 is a part view of the bridge shown in Figure 10;<br>
Figure 5 is a side view of a hinge connecting the bridge of Figure 10 to an extension<br>
of the first embodiment; and<br>
Figure 6 is a side view of a detent included in the first embodiment<br>
Figure 7 is a side view of a sock peg according to a second embodiment; and<br>
Figure 8 is an upper perspective view of the sock peg according to a second<br>
embodiment.<br>
Referring to Figures I and 2, there is shown a sock peg 1 having a clamping portion<br>
10, a handle portion 20, a flexible joint 30, a hook 40 and a hiogedly connected bridge<br>
portion 50.<br>
The clamping portion 10 and handle portion 20 comprise a pair of opposed first and<br>
second elongate members 60, 70. Bach of the first and second elongate members 60, 70 is<br>
marginally bow shaped, whereby Hie sections of the elongate members 60,70 corresponding<br>
to the clamping portion 10 are predominantly parallel, whereas the sections corresponding to<br>
the handle portion 20 diverge from the flexible joint 30 to their respective first and second<br><br>
terminal ends 61,71. la the section of the elongate members corresponding to the clamping<br>
portion 10, the internal facing surfaces thereof 62, 72 include facing or complementary<br>
arranged teeth. Preferably the opposing tee* 73 are not staggered, but face each other. The<br>
teeth 73 are configured to frictionally grip a pair of garments (not shown) such as a pair of<br>
socks. On the external surfaces of the elongate members 60,70 are a series of longitudinal<br>
and transverse ribs to provide reinforcement and added rigidity to the elongate members 60,<br>
71). The longitudinal ribs 74 extend from a point intermediate the length of the clamping<br>
portion 10 section of the elongate members 60, 70 down to their terminating ends 65. 75.<br>
Along the remainder of the lengths of the elongate members 60,70 are spaced transverse ribs<br>
76.<br>
The arched configuration of the flexible joint 30 ensures that the elongate members<br>
60,70 are urged into a damping position when the sock peg 1 is in the passive state.<br>
Close to the first terminal end 61 is an extension 41 from which extends the bridge<br>
50. The bridge SO is connected to the extension 41 by means of a narrow hinge 42.<br>
Immediately adjacent the hinge 42 is an expanded portion 51 at one end of the bridge 50.<br>
When the bridge 50 is flipped over 180º and lockably engaged to the second terminal end 71,<br>
the expanded portion 5J rests on top of the extension 41. The first terminal end 61 includes<br>
a recess 43 which is adapted to receive a narrow portion 52 extending from the expanded<br>
portion 51.<br>
The bridge 50 further includes a brace portion 53 adapted to extend between the gap<br>
separating the fir3t and second terminal ends 61, 71, A first end 54 includes an abutting<br>
surface is adapted to abut against the internal surface 44 near the first terminal end 61. The<br>
bracing portion 53 extends to a catch 55. The catch includes a cam or ramp surface 56<br>
adapted to ride over a detent 77 located near the second terminal end 71 and to be pressed<br><br>
into engagement with the detent 77. The second terminal end 71 includes a guide 78 which<br>
stands proud at the top of the second terminal end 71 and is adapted to be received within a<br>
$iot 57 at the free end of the bridge 50. Accordingly, the bridge 50 may be positively<br>
engaged with the first and second terminal ends 61,71 whereby to lock the handle portion 20<br>
against compressive forces which would otherwise be operative to open the clamp portion<br>
10 and to release any garments secured therein.<br>
Accordingly, the sock peg 1 is effective to secure a pair of garments in the clamp<br>
portion 10 for the duration of the processing of the garments, such as in a clothes washing<br>
cycle and drying process. To assist in drying the garments, advantageously the sock peg 1<br>
includes the hook portion 40 depending from the extension 41. The book portion 40 is<br>
configured for marginal deformability whereby to flex away from the first elongate member<br>
60 to enable a wire, such as clothes wire, to be inserted into the space defined by the hook<br>
portion 40 and the first elongate member 60. The hook portion 40 at its free end 45 is<br>
slightly outwardly bent to more easily admit wire into the space 46. The space 46 is wedge<br>
shaped whereby it is widest at the extension 41 end.<br>
In Figures 3 through to 6 the sock peg of the first embodiment is shown in greater<br>
detail tt can be seen that the sock peg 1 is capable of being injection moulded in one piece<br>
using; identical polymeric material for all components. This method of manufacture is<br>
advantageous in terms of cost of simplicity of supply of materials and manufacturing<br>
efficiency. The first embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 6 is integrally formed by injection<br>
moulding.<br>
Turning to Figure 7, there is shown a sock peg 100 according to a second<br>
embodiment The sock peg 100 includes a pair of first and second opposed substantially<br>
parallel elongate members 101,102 joined intermediate their respective lengths by a flexible<br><br>
arch forming a joint 103. The first and second elongate members 101,102 include a pair of<br>
opposed first and second handle portions 104, 105 at an upper end and a pair of opposed first<br>
and second clamping portions 106,107 at a lower end. Attached to the terminal end of the<br>
first handle portion 104 is a clip 108 having a flexible arm 109 defining a hook recess 110<br>
which is adapted to receive a clothes line. The clip 108 can engage with a clothes line by<br>
forcing the clothes line through the entrance 111 of the recess 110, over a detent 112 located<br>
on the inside surface of the flexible arm 109 whereby the clothes line comes to rest securely<br>
in the crook of the recess 110. The clamp 100 is thereby resistant to minor removal forces<br>
such as wind gusts by the operation of the detent 112 and the resilient nature of the flexible<br>
arm 109.<br>
A locking device is hingedly attached to the clip 108 by a thin flat flexible portion of<br>
material forming a hinge 120. The locking device 130 is adapted to rotate about the hinge<br>
120 whereby the terminal end 131 of the locking device 130 is adapted to lockably engage<br>
with the upper free end 113 of the second handle portion 105.<br>
The underside of the locking device 130 includes a cam surface 132 adapted to ride<br>
over a protrusion 114 at me free end 113. The cam surface 132 terminates in a shoulder 133<br>
which, together with the underside of the locking device 130, defines a locking recess 133<br>
into which the protrusion 114 is adapted to rest when the locking device 130 is in the locking<br>
position.<br>
The free end 113 includes an upstanding knob 11 5 extending normal to a platform<br>
1 Iα The platform 116 lies in a plane generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
second elongate member 102. Corresponding to the knob 115 the terminal end 131 includes<br>
a slot 134 (most clearly seen in Figure 9) which is adapted to cooperate with the knob 115.<br><br>
A lower planar surface 135 adjacent the locking recess 133 is adapted to abut the platform<br>
116 when the locking device 130 is in the locked position.<br>
The cam surface 132 tapers linearly towards the hinge 120 in the form of a ramp or<br>
resting surface 136. In the locked position, toe testing surface 136 is adapted to abut a<br>
support surface 117 located on the inside of the first handle portion 104.<br>
Protrusions 137 or other surface features such as ridges, grooves, bumps or a<br>
roughened surface are provided on the surface of the locking device 130. The protrusions<br>
137 enable an operator to grip the locking device 130 to enable the bridge or locking device<br>
130 to be flipped open to release the socks clasped between damping portions 106,107.<br>
As clearly seen in Figures 8 and 9, each of the first and second elongate members<br>
101, 102 includes an elongate reinforcing ridge 140, 141 which each extends substantially<br>
the length of the respective first and second elongate members 101, 102. The ridges 140,<br>
141 improve the rigidity of the elongate members 101,102 so that substantial flexing occurs<br>
onl&gt; Iα the upper sections of the first and second handle portions 104, 105, due to the<br>
tapering of the ridges 140,141 in the vicinity of those upper sections.<br>
The opposed internal surfaces 142,143 of the first and second damping portions 106,<br>
107 include complimentary sets of staggered teeth. 144 which ate adapted to grip the<br>
garments in use.<br>
