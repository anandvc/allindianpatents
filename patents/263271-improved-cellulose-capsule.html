(a)	NAME :	SCITECH CENTRE<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for preparing capsule shell based on water-soluble cellulose derivatives.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition for preparing capsule shell comprising hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC / Hypromellose) blend.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Capsules are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry as well as in the health food supplement market. The main usage thereof is as dosage form for solid, semi solid, liquid, pellet or herbal preparations. A primary object of these dosage forms is to have a good disintegration after being administered in order to enable an effective dissolution of the active substances in the appropriate digestive organ.<br>
The traditional material for forming the capsule shell is gelatin as a base with a plasticizer such as glycerin and sorbitol, opacifying agent, dye, pigment and other additives blended therein. The shell-forming compositions based on gelatin suffer from the problem of plasticity and other properties of shells being largely dependent on water content. It has been frequently seen that shells having low water content are brittle against shocks as encountered on drug filling. Also, as the water content lowers, shells can contract to loosen the cap-body engagement of capsules. Furthermore gelatin capsules are sensitive to heat and humidity besides being of animal origin, which is disfavored in the green environment movement prevalent currently.<br>
Hence capsules based on water- soluble cellulose derivatives were proposed to promote non-animal origin source and having no BSE / TSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy / transmissible spongiform encephalopathy)  risk. As a gelatin<br>
2<br><br>
substitute, the use of water-soluble film forming cellulose derivatives is widely described in the literatures.<br>
Reports of capsules made from cellulose derivatives refer to poor dissolution in vitro / in vivo, especially when compared to gelatin. To overcome this drawback, US Patent 5,756,123 discloses capsule shell using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as a base having viscosity of 2.4-5.4 cps at 20 deg C. It has improved shapability and disintegration ability comparable to conventional gelatin shells. However, very low viscosity of HPMC resulting from low molecular weight induces higher shell brittleness that leads to poor strength of capsule shell.<br>
Further, US patent no 6,517,865 relates to non-animal polymer compositions suitable for shell forming, particularly hard and soft capsules, comprising water soluble cellulose ethers, hydrocolloids and sequestering agents. It discloses capsule shell using HPMC blend having viscosity of 3 -15 cps. It attempts overcome loss of transparency of the shell and brittleness [by using a higher viscosity of HPMC (greater than 6 cps) since higher the viscosity of HPMC better the mechanical strength] of the HPMC shell of prior art.<br>
In addition to the drawbacks of the HPMC shells as discussed above, it is known that capsule shell based on HPMC with low viscosity have better solubility and disintegration ability however poor mechanical / tensile strength. Capsule shells base on HPMC with high viscosity have better mechanical and tensile strength at the cost of having poor solubility and disintegration,<br>
There have been attempts made in the prior art to make capsule shell based on water-soluble cellulose derivative with both good solubility and mechanical / tensile strength, especially using low viscosity HPMC (upto 6 cps only) but none have proved successful. Therefore, there is a long felt need in the prior art for the capsule shells based on water soluble cellulose derivatives that overcomes the problems of the prior art cellulose shells and that can also replace the conventional gelatin shells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
It has been unexpectedly found that the tensile strength and solubilization properties of the capsule shell based on water-soluble cellulose derivative, especially HPMC is<br>
5<br><br>
markedly improved when at least two HPMC grades having pre-determined viscosities are blended in a specific ratio to form the HPMC blend.<br>
According to the present invention, the preferred water-soluble cellulose derivative is HPMC.<br>
The composition of the capsule shell comprises blend of at least two grades of HPMC having pre-determined viscosities. The blend preferably comprises at least two HPMC grades wherein the first grade has a lower viscosity and the second grade has higher viscosity.<br>
The composition of capsule shell comprises the HMPC blend of at least two HPMC wherein the first HPMC has a viscosity of about 3 mPa-s and is blended with the second HPMC having a viscosity of 4.5 mPa•s or about 6 mPa•s.<br>
As mentioned above, the tensile strength and solubilization of capsule shell based on HPMC is improved by using at least two grades of HPMC in a specific ratio. The capsule shells having different ratios of two HPMC are prepared and it has been unexpectedly found that tensile strength and. solubility are optimum at a specific ratio.<br>
The preferred ratio of the first HPMC to second HPMC is from about 20: 80 to about 40:60.<br>
In another embodiment, the preferred ratio of the first HPMC to the second HPMC is from about 25:75 to about 35:65.<br>
The composition of present invention may further comprise gelling agents, gelling promoters, coloring agents and so on.<br>
6<br><br>
The gelling agent is selected from carrageenan, gellan gum, and pectin. According to present invention the gelling agent is present in the range of 0.2 to 3.0 % w/w on dry HPMC.<br>
The gelling promoters for assisting in gelation of gelling agent are potassium ion, sodium ion or both. The sodium ion may also be blended in the form of a water-soluble compound such as sodium citrate. The potassium ion may be blended in the form of a water-soluble compound such as potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, potassium acetate and potassium citrate and it is present in the range of 0.2 to 95 % w/w on dry gelling agent.<br>
These gelling agents can add one or mixture of appropriate gelling promoters to each gelling agent if necessary. For example, potassium ion, ammonium ion, calcium ion, or mixture of these ions are able to be added in case of carrageenan.<br>
The coloring agents and opacifiers are selected from permitted colorant and dyes as listed in Rule 27 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rule (India) and permissible under the regulatory requirements of the country of use. They comply with the Bureau of Indian Standards ( BIS) and / or Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and / or EEC directives.<br>
In an embodiment, the coloring agent may be a color selected from the group comprising annatto, carotene, chlorophyll, cochineal, curcumin, caramel, riboflavin, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, titanium di-oxide, black iron oxide and mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the coloring agent may be selected from quinazarine green, alizarin cyanine green, fast green, tartrazine, sunset yellow, quinoline yellow, erythrosine, eosin YS, toney red, ponceau 4R, carmoisine, indigo carmine, brilliant blue, orange G, resorcin brown, naphthol blue black, allura red, and combinations thereof.<br>
7<br><br>
In another embodiment, the coloring agent may be lake salts (example aluminum ) any of the above listed water soluble coloring agents and combinations thereof.<br>
The coloring agent is preferably used in an amount of from 0.01 to about 20% w/w of dry HPMC.<br>
The detailed manufacturing process for preparation of improved capsule shell<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
i)	Blend of at least two HPMC grades is dispersed in hot water wherein the first<br>
HPMC grade has the viscosity of about 3 mPa•s and the second HPMC has a viscosity of about 4.5 mPa•s or about 6 mPa•s and wherein the ratio of the amounts of the first to second HPMC grades varies from about 20:80 to about 40:60.<br>
ii) The solution of gelling agent and gelling aid is separately prepared in hot water and said solutions are added at the predetermined temperature in the said solution of HPMC blend to give a capsule preparing solution;<br>
iii) The capsule preparing solution of step (ii) is aged for about 8 to 20 hours at a temperature of about 38 to 46 deg C and then the said solution is diluted by water.<br>
iv) A dipping mould is inserted into the capsule preparing solution of step (iii) at a predetermined temperature and then the dipping mould is drawn out and inducing setting of the capsule preparing solution adhering to the pin.<br>
According to present invention the preferable time for ageing is about 8 to about 15 hrs. The preferred temperature for ageing is 40-44 deg C and the preferred viscosity of the solution is 1000 to 1200 cps.<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the hot water dispersion of said two grades of HPMC is cooled to 20 deg C for total solublization and then heating to about 40 - 44 deg C before adding the same to said solution containing gelling agent and gelling aid.<br>
An advantage of the disclosed process is that ageing of the said capsule preparing solution of step (ii) for about 8 to 20 hours at a temperature of about 38 to 46 deg C raises its viscosity to its natural extent and thereafter diluting the said solution by water brings the viscosity of the said solution in the desired range of 1100 to 1600 cps.<br>
This manufacturing procedure is only shown as one typical method. Our invention is related with the composition of HPMC but does not limit the manufacturing methods.<br>
The present invention shall now be specifically described by way of illustrative and non-limiting examples. It shall be understood that many variations and modifications thereto will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the broadest scope and ambit of the invention as set forth herein above.<br>
Experiments: Evaluation methods:<br>
1)	Solubility of shells/films and capsules<br>
One shell /film (1 cm X 3 cm) or one empty capsule, both are sank into the<br>
medium by using the sinker, is tested by the dissolution apparatus (paddle<br>
method). The time when the shell or film or the capsules is completely<br>
dissolved is defined as the solubility time.<br>
Test conditions; 300 ml, 50 rpm, 37 deg C.<br>
Test medium; distilled water and 12.5 mM phosphate buffer (pH6.8)<br>
2)	Tensile strength<br>

Evaluation: (1) HPMC film<br>
HPMC film dissolved shortly as the ratio of HPMC A increased into the composition. These phenomena were observed in both water and the buffer (pH6.8) [Ref. table 6,7,8 and 9 ]. HPMC A and HPMC B / HPMC C are different on their viscosity. The viscosity reflects the molecular weight distribution of HPMC. Namely, the molecular weight distribution of HPMC A shifts small way compared with HPMC B / HPMC C. It is clear that HPMC A is easily dissolved compared with HPMC B / HPMC C.<br>
However, the tensile strength of the films was once weak but it became strong, as the ratio of HPMC A increased and subsequently became weak again. \t was found that when the ratio of A was from 0.25 to 0.3, the tensile strength became the strongest [Ref. table 6,7,8 and 91.<br>
The above phenomena was not found to be influenced / affected by type of gelling agent.<br>
