CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br><br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/786,464, filed on March 27, 2006, entitled "A Method of Power Control Algorithm for DFMA Systems" the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
I. Field<br><br>
[0002] The subject technology relates generally to communications systems and methods, and more particularly to systems and methods that employ power control components to mitigate interference between wireless cells and within a given cell.<br><br>
II. Background<br><br>
[0003] Wireless communications systems have been applied to almost every area of human interaction. From cell phones to text messaging systems, communications technology in this arena are constantly changing, improving, and evolving into other forms. One such technology includes the amount of digital data being employed such as Internet information that is now communicated to mobile wireless systems. Many systems currently deliver such digital information where there is a plurality of design standards to define how to deliver desired digital content to respective users. One such standard includes IEEE 802.20 that defines design guidelines for wireless systems that communicate various types of data.<br><br>
[0004] In general, the guidelines set forth in 802.20 are intended as a specification for the PHY and MAC layers of an air interface for interoperable packet-data mobile broadband wireless access systems. Typically, such systems operate in licensed frequency bands below 3.5 GHz, support peak data rates per user in excess of 1 Mbps, support vehicular mobility classes up to 250 Km/h, and cover cell sizes commensurate with ubiquitous metropolitan area networks. This includes targeting spectral efficiencies that employ sustained user data rates with numbers of active users significantly higher than achieved by existing mobile systems. <br><br>
[0005] Other features of 802.20 include the enablement for worldwide deployment of cost effective, spectrum efficient, always on and interoperable mobile broadband wireless access systems in order to address various user needs. These needs include mobile and ubiquitous Internet access, transparent support of Internet applications, access to enterprise intranet services, along with transparent access to infotainment and location services. Thus, the 802.20 specification fills the performance gap between high data-rate low mobility services currently developed in general 802 specifications and high mobility cellular networks.<br><br>
[0006] The technical feasibility of 802.20 wireless systems has been demonstrated by proprietary systems currently in deployment and trial. These systems use technological components in wide deployment today, such as modems, radios, antennas and PHY/MAC protocols. These solutions may use well understood spread spectrum technologies (such as frequency hopping), radio technologies (such as OFDM), advanced signal processing techniques (such as adaptive antennas) and cellular architectures. Also, these technologies have been successfully tested and deployed over the past and are finding increased usage in the LAN/MAN and Cellular environments, for example. Commercial deployment of cellular wireless networks in bands licensed for mobile services demonstrates that air interface support for high reliability networks is in fact suitable for commercial deployment.<br><br>
[0007] One area of interest with current design standards such as 802.20 relates to how a given wireless cell communicates to user equipment or terminals within its cell and how one wireless cell may impact on one or more other cells. This includes how to specify the amount of interference that may be caused by one or more wireless terminals in the cell and the impact these terminals may have on other terminals operating in adjacent cells. In general, it is desirable to control the amount of power generated in any one cell to mitigate interference in other cells that are within a given proximity and how the cells may be impacted. Also, terminals within any given cell may impact other terminals within the same cell since it may not be possible to have perfect orthogonality within the cell thus causing some leakage or interference within the cell. Currently, one method proposed by 802.20 involves controlling the amount of power that is transmitted within the cell. This method involves controlling the relative power spectral density from user equipment within the cells. A problem with this method is that there is no feedback or communications to determine whether there is an impact from one cell or <br><br>
another. Also, in addition to relative power spectral density controls there may be more effective methods to control the amount of interference between cells and/or the potential for interference within a given cell.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0008] The following presents a simplified summary of various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview. It is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.<br><br>
[0009] Systems and methods are provided for controlling uplink power in wireless network cells in order to mitigate interference between cells and/or interference within a given cell. Various methods employ parameters that are maintained and communicated between a base station (sometimes referred to as Node B) and one or more components/devices or user equipment that communicates with the base station and forms a respective cell. In general, cells operate with little knowledge that another cell may also be within proximity and thus be a potential for interference. Thus, the base stations operating a given cell may communicate some general status parameters including whether or not there are any devices currently communicating in the cell. Thus, one parameter that may be communicated between cells that indicates the general notion of load in the cell, where a load indicator may signal the interference experienced by the cell. From these and other parameters, interference can be mitigated between cells by employing the parameters to reduce transmit power at the respective devices operating within a given cell. By reducing transmit power in view of the determined parameters, the noise impact between cells can be mitigated as well as the impact by such factors as signal leakage between devices.<br><br>
[0010] In an embodiment, a power control component employs the load indicator and another parameter such as power headroom, where such headroom can be a function of a reference signal plus the maximum deliverable power by a given terminal. Based on such parameters, power transmissions can be tailored at the transmitting device in the cell to reduce the impact on devices within the cells or devices associated with other cells. In another embodiment, a power density control component controls <br><br>
the power headroom parameter (or relative transmit power capability) along with a parameter referred to as absolute power spectral density at the device. Based on this combination of power headroom and/or absolute power spectral density, devices operating in a given cell can adjust a given transmit power output in order to mitigate interference in a wireless network.<br><br>
[0011] To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative embodiments are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways in which the embodiments may be practiced, all of which are intended to be covered.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0001] Systems and methods are provided for mitigating interference in a wireless network by controlling transmitter power levels in the network. In one embodiment, a method for controlling power in a wireless network is provided. The method includes determining a relative power parameter at a wireless device such as a mobile wireless terminal and receiving a load parameter at the wireless device, where the load parameter is associated with at least one other wireless cell. The method includes adjusting transmit power of the wireless device in view of the relative power parameter and the load parameter. In another embodiment, the transmit power can be controlled in view of an absolute power spectral density parameter. In still yet another embodiment, along with relative power and absolute power spectral density parameters, transmit power can be adjusted in view of a relative power spectral density parameter. [0002] As used in this application, the terms "component," "network," "system," and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a communications device and the device can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate over local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a wired or wireless network such as the Internet). [0003] Fig. 1 illustrates a wireless network system 100 having control components for mitigating interference within the system. The system 100 includes a plurality of cells illustrated at reference numerals 110 through 120, where each of the respective cells include a station (reference numerals 124 through 130) that communicates over wireless networks (reference numerals 134 through 140) to one or more user devices (reference numerals 144 through 150) within the respective cells. The user devices 144- <br><br>
150 can include substantially any type of wireless communicating device such as a cell phone, computer, personal assistant, hand held or laptop devices, and so forth.<br><br>
[0004] In one embodiment, a power control component 160 (or components) is provided to control power of the user devices 144-150, wherein such control is based upon a relative transmit power of the devices. In another embodiment, a power control component 170 is provided to control power as a function of relative device power and an absolute power spectral density parameter associated with the devices. The power control components 160 and 170 can be executed as an algorithm, for example, that is shared across stations 124 through 130 and user devices 144-150. For example, the station 124 may employ all or portions of components 160 and/or 170 with user devices 144, whereas the station 126 may employ all or portions of components 160 and/or 170 with user devices 146. In general, the user devices 144-150 (or terminals) report a set of parameters along with a request for data transmission within the respective cells 110- 120. Thus, a respective serving cell 110-120 controls a change in a user device's 144- 150 relative transmit power and/or the absolute value of the user device's absolute power spectral density, while other cells 110-120 impact the change in the device transmit power by communicating information on cell load as is described in more detail below.<br><br>
[0005] Generally, the power control components 160 and 170 allow for controlling uplink power in the cells 110-120 in order to mitigate interference between cells and/or interference within a given cell. Various processes employ parameters that are maintained and communicated between the stations 124-130 (sometimes referred to as Node B) and associated user devices 144-150. In general, cells 110-120 operate with little knowledge that another cell may also be within proximity and thus be a potential for interference. Thus, the stations 124-130 operating a given cell 110-120 may communicate some general status parameters including whether or not there are any devices 144-150 currently communicating in the given cell. Thus, one parameter that may be communicated between cells 110-120 indicates the general notion of load in the cell, where a load indicator bit for example, may signal that at least one device 144-150 is communicating in the cell. From these and other parameters, interference can be mitigated between cells 110-120 by employing the parameters to reduce transmit power at the respective devices 144-150 operating within a given cell. By reducing transmit <br><br>
power in view of the determined parameters, the impact between cells 110-120 can be mitigated as well as the impact by such factors as signal leakage between devices operating within a given cell.<br><br>
[0006] In an embodiment, the power control component 160 employs the load indicator bits noted above and another parameter such as power headroom, where such headroom can be a function of a reference signal maintained at the stations 124-130 plus the maximum deliverable power by given devices 144-150. Based on such parameters, power transmissions can be tailored at the transmitting device 144-150 in the cell 124- 130 to reduce the impact on devices within the cells or devices associated with other cells. In another embodiment, the power density control component 170 controls the power headroom parameter (or relative transmit power capability) along with a parameter referred to as absolute power spectral density at the devices 144-150. Based on this combination of power headroom and absolute power spectral density, devices 144-150 operating in a given cell 124-130 can adjust a given transmit power output in order to mitigate interference.<br><br>
[0007] It is noted that the power control components 160 and power spectral density control components 170 can be combined with existing methods to control power in a given cell 110-120. For example, one existing method employs a relative power spectral density parameter to control power in a given cell. Such relative power spectral density parameters can be employed with the headroom parameters and the absolute power spectral density parameters to further mitigate interference within or across cells 110-120. These concepts will be described in more detail below, where Fig. 2 illustrates a method that controls relative device power, Fig. 3 illustrates a method that controls absolute power spectral density and relative device power, and Fig. 4 shows an existing method that controls relative power spectral density, where Fig. 5 illustrates control combinations that can be utilized from the methods depicted in Figs. 2-4.<br><br>
[0008] Before proceeding, one or more of the following considerations may be applied when applying the power control components 160 and/or 170. As noted above, the components 160 or 170 can be provided as a power control algorithm for frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, for example. Generally, these components 160 and 170 are employed to reduce inter-cell interference and provide scheduler flexibility within cells to allocate bandwidth to different users, where the scheduler is <br><br>
employed at the stations 124-130 to determine how much bandwidth is available for a given user. In one example application of the components 160 and 170, the following assumptions may be utilized: Typically, each device 144-150 has a single serving cell 110-120 in the uplink channel. The serving cell 110-130 is typically not aware of interference caused by the transmission from its devices 144-150 to other cells. Generally, each cell broadcasts an uplink load indicator (e.g., bit signaling busy or not) in the downlink channel to a respective user device 144-150 in a periodic manner. Also, in general, each device 144-150 decodes load indicator bits from all cells 110-120 in its candidate set and reduces its transmit power and/or power spectral density (PSD) accordingly.<br><br>
[0009] Figs. 2, 3, and 4 illustrate power control processes and power spectral density control processes for wireless systems. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series or number of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the processes described herein are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the subject methodologies disclosed herein.<br><br>
[0010] Fig. 2 illustrates a power control process 200 for a wireless system, where the process can be implemented as an algorithm if desired. Proceeding to 210, a reference signal is maintained at a base station. In this case, a reference Signal-to- Noise-Ratio (SNR) is maintained at the base station or Node-B based on a periodically transmitted signal and/or based on Quality of Service (QoS) of transmitted traffic. At 220, the user equipment (UE) or device periodically reports a power headroom parameter based on the reference signal transmit (Tx) power. Generally, the power headroom is a function of the UE maximum Tx power and any load indication commands decoded from the other non-serving cells. At 230, the base station grants an uplink assignment to the UE. For instance, a Node-B grants an uplink assignment which can include the following information: [0011] a. Bandwidth; i. Number of tones <br><br>
b. Packet format i. Packet size and modulation<br><br>
At 240, the UE transmits the formatted packet in accordance with the assignment at 230 with the indicated maximum transmit power. The following example equations are provided to illustrate more detail with respect to the process 200. [0012] The following notations can apply:<br><br>
Pref {i,t) = Reference Tx power for UE i at time t<br><br>
Wref = Reference bandwidth<br><br>
Pn^x (z) = Maximum Tx power for UE i based on UE capability<br><br>
Pm?X{i,t) = Maximum allowed Tx power for UE i at time t<br><br>
?(i,t) = Maximum supportable Tx power headroom for UE <br><br>
L(i,t) = Effective load indicator command for UE i at time t<br><br>
/(•) = Function to map load indicator command to Tx power reduction (dB) g(-) = Function to take previous and current reference power into account (dB)<br><br>
ES 1 = Rx energy per modulation symbol for user i<br><br>
N1 = Thermal plus other interference PSD<br><br>
where the UE reports:<br><br>
A(i,t) = A(i,t -l) - f(L(i,t)) + g(Pef (i,t),Pef (i,t - l))<br><br>
Assuming that the UE transmits with constrained power on the reference bandwidth, the maximum SNR per modulation symbol can be written as:<br><br><br>
The scheduler at the station or Node B can now flexibly allocate bandwidth to different users where:<br><br>
Wassign (i) = Assigned bandwidth for UE i TF n {i) = Assigned transport format for UE i<br><br><br>
Thus, each assigned user transmits data at the power level given by:<br><br>
p 1 assigned d V &gt;) 
<br>
[0013] Fig. 3 illustrates a power spectral density (PSD) control process 300 for wireless networks. Similar, to the process 200 above, the process 300 includes maintaining a reference signal at the base station at 310. In contrast to the process 300, there is a variation in control at 320 that involves the UE reporting an additional variable, namely, the maximum allowed Tx power given as:<br><br>
^0-,0 -io-/(i(l?)/1°<br><br>
[0014] With the additional information of maximum allowed Tx power, the base station or Node-B can control both the Tx PSD and the receiver (Rx) SNR from each scheduled user. Generally, acts 330 and 340 are similar to the process 200 described above. Namely, at 330, the base station grants an uplink assignment to the UE which can include bandwidth and a packet format as previously described. At 340, the UE transmits the formatted packet in accordance with the assignment at 330 with the indicated maximum transmit power and the additional parameter of maximum allowed transmit power.<br><br>
[0015] Fig. 4 illustrates a relative power spectral density (PSD) control process 400 for a wireless network. At 410, a reference PSD is maintained at a base station or Node- B based on a periodically transmitted signal and/or based on QoS of transmitted traffic. At 420, the UE periodically reports the reference PSD delta and an associated bandwidth, where the Tx PSD is a function of the reference PSD and any load indication commands decoded from the other non-serving cells; and the associated bandwidth is computed from the maximum transmit power and the Tx PSD. At 430, the base station or Node-B grants an uplink assignment including the following information: [0016] a. Bandwidth i. Number of tones b. Packet format i. Packet size and modulation <br><br>
At 440, the UE transmits the packet in accordance with the assignment with the Tx PSD. The following example equations are provided to illustrate more detail with respect to the process 400. [0017] The following notations can apply:<br><br>
Fref (i) = Reference PSD for UE i ft?(i) = Tx PSD for UE i<br><br>
Apsd (i, t) = Reference PSD boost (dB) for UE i at time t<br><br>
W1x(I) = Associated Tx bandwidth for UE i<br><br>
The UE reports:<br><br>
Apsd(i,t) = ?^(U -l) - f(Ll t) + g(Pref (i,t),Pref (i,t -\))<br><br>
P (i)<br><br>
WJi) = -u<br><br>
wherein:<br><br>
F (0 = Ml.10^?w wref<br><br>
The reference PSD is defined as:<br><br>
VYref<br><br>
The scheduler uses the following criteria to allocate bandwidth to different users with the following constraint:<br><br>
Wass!gn(i) = Assigned bandwidth for UE i 
<br>
Thus, each assigned UE sets its transmit PSD to Ftt(0 and transmits data at the power level given by:<br><br>
Pass?gned (j) = F?0 - wassign(i) 
<br>
It is noted that the base station or Node-B does not control the absolute value of the Tx PSD from each UE. Instead, it controls the difference in Tx PSD from the reference <br><br>
PSD. More details regarding differences between power control, absolute power spectral density control, and relative power spectral density control will be described below with respect to Fig. 6.<br><br>
[0018] Fig. 5, power control component combinations 500 are illustrated. In this embodiment, it is shown that various combinations of control algorithms can be implemented or dynamically selected between respective base stations and associated user devices or equipment. At 510, power controls are shown and are generally related to the processes depicted in Fig. 2. At 520, power controls employ absolute transmit power spectral density (PSD) controls as depicted in Fig. 3, and at 530, PSD controls are provided that employ relative transmitter PSD controls. Thus, in one case, it is possible to employ a single component such as the power controls 510. In another example, the power controls 510 and the power controls 520 may be utilized. In still yet another example, power controls 510, 520, and 530 may be employed concurrently to reduce user device power and mitigate interference in the wireless network or across networks. As can be appreciated, various combinations of the components 510, 520, and 530 can be employed at different times or according to different applications. [0019] Fig. 6 illustrates power control and power spectral density control considerations 600 for wireless networks. It is noted that:<br><br>
The process or algorithm 200 controls the relative UE Tx power;<br><br>
The process or algorithm 300 controls the relative UE Tx power and the absolute Tx PSD; and<br><br>
The process or algorithm 400 controls the relative UE Tx PSD. In the following description, differences between these respective process are analyzed. [0020] Without loss in generality, it can be assumed that the reference Rx SNR for all users is approximately the same (e.g., same channel, same erasure/error rate). In a typical scenario, this need not be the case and the Rx SNR can vary as a function of the exact channel. Further, it can be assumed that the maximum Tx power of each UE is the same (e.g., same UE class across the network). At 610, isolated cells are considered where power control differences are considered at 620 for isolated cell. The following provides an example analysis for power control 620: [0021] In process 200 above, each UE reports: <br><br><br>
and the uplink assignment is such that:<br><br><br>
U V JVV i yßj&gt;B (Vi))<br><br>
Each assigned user transmits data at the power level given by:<br><br>
£ p assigned a V) ) 
<br>
Therefore, each user could transmit at current maximum allowed power. However, the user specific Tx PSD varies depending upon the bandwidth allocation and can be tightly controlled if the process 300 is employed.<br><br>
[0022] At 630 of Fig. 6, PSD differences are considered where the following example analysis is provided:<br><br>
In the PSD control algorithm, each UE reports:<br><br>
A^ (I,*) and W1x(I) = -£=-<br><br>
The uplink assignment is such that:<br><br>
P 1 assigned ( ViV) = f ^tt V (i^) - W " assign ( ViV) = — trr m= s- -\ . ? assign a V ))<br><br>
W1x(I) W^n (I) = W1x(X)<br><br>
=&gt; P assigned ( Vi) / 
<br>
The equality holds if and only if:<br><br>
W " assign ( Vi1) / = <br><br>
Thus, the UE does not transmit at maximum power, unless it is assigned the transmit bandwidth that it reported to the scheduler associated with the base station. <br><br>
[0023] At 640 of Fig. 6, inter-cell interference is considered where the following example analysis can apply:<br><br>
The transmit PSD from a UE when process 200 or 300 is applied can be written as:<br><br>
( Vi)/<br><br>
^m maaxx 2 Q-/(Z(i,f))/10<br><br>
Wass?gn ii)<br><br>
The transmit PSD from a UE when process 400 is applied can be written as:<br><br>
F (? = ^ Q-/(£(i,0)/10 pref<br><br>
Generally, both schemes result in identical PSD if:<br><br>
Apsd (i,t) = 10 + 10* log10[— -=-? Wass?gn (l)<br><br>
However, the process 200 or 300 place no UE explicit restriction on the choice of the assignment bandwidth, whereas in process 400:<br><br>
Generally, process 300 controls both UE Tx power and PSD, and does not place any restriction on the Node-B's choice of bandwidth assignment. The uplink feedback overhead is similar in process or algorithms 300 and 400, and is smaller for algorithm or process 200.<br><br>

[0010] Exemplary communication system 700 is presented as a basis for the description of various aspects set forth herein.

Additionally, functional entities depicted in exemplary communication system 100 may be omitted or combined. Also, the location or placement of the functional entities in the network may be varied. [0011] Fig. 8 illustrates an exemplary end node 800 (e.g., a mobile node) associated with various aspects. Exemplary end node 800 may be an apparatus that may be used as any one of the end nodes 744, 746, 744', 746', 744", 746" depicted in Fig. 7.

[0016] Fig. 9 provides an illustration of an exemplary access node 900 implemented in accordance with various aspects described herein. Exemplary access node 900 may be an apparatus utilized as any one of access nodes 740, 740', 740" depicted in Fig. 7. Access node 900 includes a processor 904, memory 910, a network/internetwork interface 920 and a wireless communication interface 930, coupled together by a bus 906.

[0018] Processor 904 under control of various modules (e.g., routines) included in memory 910 controls operation of access node 900 to perform various signaling and processing. The modules included in memory 910 may be executed on startup or as called by other modules that may be present in memory 910. Modules may exchange data, information, and signals when executed.

CDMA, TDMA, etc.), multiple terminals can transmit concurrently on the uplink. For such a system, the pilot subbands may be shared among different terminals. The channel estimation techniques may be used in cases where the pilot subbands for each terminal span the entire operating band (possibly except for the band edges). Such a pilot subband structure would be desirable to obtain frequency diversity for each terminal. The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units used for channel estimation may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated <br><br>
circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. [0002] For a software implementation, the techniques described herein may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in memory units and executed by processors. The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art.<br><br>
