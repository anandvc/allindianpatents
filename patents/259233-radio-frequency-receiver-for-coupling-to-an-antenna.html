				<td>SINGLE CHIP LNA AND VCO HAVING SIMILAR RESONANT CIRCUIT<br>
TOPOLOGY AND USING SAME CALIBRATION SIGNAL TO<br>
COMPENSATE FOR PROCESS VARIATIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
These teachings generally concern radio frequency (RF) receivers and, more specifically,<br>
concern single chip RF receiver designs.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
The following abbreviations are herewith defined:<br>
BB baseband<br>
1C integrated circuit<br>
IF intermediate frequency<br>
LNA low noise amplifier<br>
LO local oscillator<br>
PLL phase lock loop<br>
RF radio frequency<br>
RX receiver<br>
VCO voltage controlled oscillator<br>
VDD power supply voltage<br>
Presently, multi-band receivers that are implemented using ICs incorporate receiver front<br>
ends that include multiple off-chip filters. These multiple off-chip filters increase the size,<br>
complexity, power consumption and the assembly cost of multi-band transceivers and<br>
their use is generally undesirable.<br>
It can be appreciated that those skilled in the art would desire a one-chip, multi-band<br>
receiver design. Such a one-chip multi-band receiver design would preferably not require<br>
multiple off-chip filters, including a particular filter (image rejection filter) that is<br>
typically positioned between the LNA and the frequency mixer. As is explained in<br>
commonly assigned US 2003/0176174 Al, "Method and Apparatus Providing Calibration<br>
Technique for RF Performance Tuning", Pauli Seppinen, Aarno Parssinen, Mikael<br>
Gustafsson and Mika Makitalo (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), the<br>
image rejection filter(s) are typically required due to leakage of transmitter power into the<br>
receiver input in full duplex systems, having a simultaneous transmission and reception<br>
mode (such as 3G CDMA systems).<br>
However, the elimination of the off-chip filter between the LNA and the mixer requires<br>
that signal filtering be accomplished by other means. If the signal filtering is not<br>
performed, or is performed incorrectly, the mixer output signal will include an undesired<br>
signal component in addition to the desired signal component. This undesired signal<br>
component can, in a worst-case scenario, totally destroy the reception of the desired<br>
signal component(s).<br>
Further, multi-band requirements for the receiver can alter the front end in such a way<br>
that a fixed filter can no longer be implemented between the LNA and mixer. This can<br>
occur because, typically, one set of controllable front-end components are used for each<br>
frequency band of interest. Thus, those skilled in the art would also desire a front-end<br>
design that accommodates multi-band operation without the complexity associated with<br>
providing filters for each frequency band.<br>
More specifically, a portion of a receiver (the receiver "front end") 100 according to the<br>
prior art is depicted in Fig. 1. In this particular example the receiver 100 operates in five<br>
frequency bands (Band_l to Band_5). The receiver 100 includes filtering and impedance<br>
matching components 111 and 115 (referred to for simplicity as filters) that are connected<br>
to a wideband antenna 105. The filters 111 andl 15 are in turn respectively connected to<br>
LNAs 121 and!25. The outputs of the LNAs 121 and!25 are in turn connected to image<br>
rejection filters 151, 153,...155, respectively, and thence to mixers 131, 133, ..., 135.<br>
Using the mixers 131-135 the signals are mixed down (downconverted) to baseband (e.g.,<br>
zero Hertz, close to zero Hertz, or to any suitable IF when implementing a<br>
superheterodyne or equivalent receiver) for further signal processing. VCOs contained in<br>
PLL and calibration circuit blocks 141-145 are connected to mixers 131-135,<br>
respectively, and provide appropriate mixing frequency signals thereto. As is apparent<br>
from Fig. 1, separate calibration circuitry (part of the PLL and calibration blocks 141 -145)<br>
is required for servicing the five frequency bands of interest. Note that Band__l and<br>
Band_2 are serviced by the same PLL and calibration block 141 in this non-limiting<br>
example of the prior art.<br>
The complexity of the prior art receiver design 100 is further increased by the need for<br>
off-chip image rejection filters 151-155. The effective circuit duplication, function<br>
overlap and need for chip interconnects to accommodate off-chip filtering processes<br>
results in a complex and costly receiver implementation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The foregoing and other problems are overcome, and other advantages are realized, in<br>
accordance with the presently preferred embodiments of these teachings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A receiver front end 200 constructed in accordance with this invention is depicted in<br>
simplified form in Fig. 2. In contrast to the multiple circuits of the prior art receiver front<br>
end 100 depicted in Fig. 1, at least LNA 220 and PLL 240/VCO 245 circuit elements are<br>
implemented in a common 1C (single chip) 10. In addition, in many cases it is also<br>
desirable for the mixer 230 to be located on the same chip 10 to ensure adequate gain for<br>
the RP signal.<br>
In particular, the output of the off-chip antenna 105 is coupled to a tunable filter 210 that<br>
is tunable to the frequency bands of interest. The filter 210 is in turn connected to the<br>
input of the LNA 220, and the output of the LNA 220 is in turn connected to the input of<br>
a selective mixer 230. Calibration-related outputs of the tunable local oscillator (PLL)<br>
240 are connected to the filter 210 and the LNA 220, and a frequency signal output<br>
(VCO_out) is coupled to the mixer 230.<br>
Contrasting FIG. 2 to FIG. 1, it is immediately apparent from FIG. 2 that a feature of this<br>
invention is the elimination of multiple redundant circuits that perform the same function<br>
for each frequency band of interest. This is accomplished by the implementation of<br>
tunable circuit elements in resonant circuits that can be tuned to the desired frequency<br>
bands of interest, as well as for use in compensating for component variations. The tuning<br>
function is accomplished by associated multiple reactive circuit elements (not depicted in<br>
FIG. 2) that are used to tune to the tunable circuit elements to the desired frequency<br>
bands.<br>
Since the depicted receiver front end elements 210, 220, 230 and 240 are preferably<br>
implemented in a single chip, the circuit components that comprise these individual<br>
circuit elements are subject to the same process variations, including the multiple reactive<br>
circuit elements used to tune the LNA 220 and the VCO 245. This fact has the desirable<br>
effect that the calibration signal developed to calibrate the VCO 245 can likewise be used<br>
to calibrate the LNA 220. The availability of a tuning signal for tuning the LNA 220 load<br>
and input impedance matching eliminates the need for a separate calibration circuit for<br>
the LNA 220. Further, this circuit implementation increases the selectivity of the LNA<br>
220 to such a degree that a separate image signal rejection filter, filters 151-155 depicted<br>
in FIG. 1, are rendered unnecessary.<br>
A particular implementation of the receiver front end topology illustrated in FIG. '2 is<br>
depicted in FIG. 3. The LNA 220 and VCO 245 are inductively coupled to mixer 230.<br>
The LNA 220 and VCO 245 each have associated discrete switched capacitor arrays 250<br>
and 260 that are switched by switches 270 and 280 (capacitors C1-C6 and switches SW1,<br>
SW2 and SW3).<br>
A single-chip circuit design that does not rely on external components can require process<br>
variation compensation. At frequencies up to several GHz the approximately +10%<br>
variation of capacitance values can cause 300 MHz to 500 MHz variations in the<br>
resonance frequency of the VCO 245. To compensate for this variation in operating<br>
frequency, a process variation calibration is preferably performed using the capacitors<br>
C1-C6 and switches SW1, SW2 andSWS. If the selectivity in the LNA 220 is increased<br>
the same type of problem can arise, also requiring calibration to be performed.<br>
Furthermore, multi-band operation requires band selection capability for the VCO 245<br>
and the LNA 220 for which the switchable capacitors can also be used.<br>
A desirable feature of this invention is the similarity in the circuit construction and<br>
resonance circuit topology of the LNA 220 and the VCO 245, and their implementation<br>
in a single 1C. A significant distinction between the construction of the LNA 220 and the<br>
VCO 245 is that in the VCO 245 the gates of transistors Ql and Q2 are cross-connected<br>
to provide positive feedback to establish an oscillatory condition, whereas the gates of Ql<br>
and Q2 in the LNA 220 form the (differential) signal input nodes of the LNA 220. In<br>
other respects, the circuit construction of the LNA 220 and the VCO 245 are substantially<br>
identical, including the connections for the current bias (Ibias), voltage reference (Vref)<br>
and voltage control (Vcont) signals, and the voltage-tuned varactor diodes VR1, VR2 and<br>
various related transistors Q3-Q8. The component values are also preferably substantially<br>
identical (within the limits of the 1C process variation and differences in small signal<br>
gain).<br>
Note further that the output of the LNA 220, and the output of the VCO 245, are both<br>
inductively coupled (inductive coupling factor k) via their respective coils Tl to the<br>
mixer- 230 diode bridge (Dl -D4) via-mixer coils T2S T3.- A simplified diagram of this<br>
coupling is shown in Fig. 4. In general, ihe mixer connections and operational frequency<br>
mode selection can be as described in commonly assigned US 6,621,365 Bl, "Method<br>
and Apparatus Providing a Dual Mode VCO for an Adaptive Receiver", Juha Hallivuori<br>
and Pauli Seppinen (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).<br>
Due to the fact the LNA 220 and the VCO 245 have a substantially identical resonant<br>
circuit topology, and are subject to the same process variations by being fabricated in the<br>
same 1C, it has advantageously been found that the process variation calibration signal<br>
determined for the VCO 245 can be used as well to calibrate the LNA 220. This<br>
calibration signal can be determined in various ways. One suitable and preferred<br>
technique is described by Kalle Asikainen and Paul! Seppinen in commonly assigned<br>
U.S. Patent No.: 6,639,474, entitled "Adjustable Oscillator", incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety. For example, in this approach an adjustable oscillator has at least<br>
one resonant circuit and the frequency of the oscillator is adjusted by changing the<br>
resonant frequency of the at least one resonant circuit by means of a control signal. With<br>
regard to the control signal, a minimum value and a maximum value are selected, as is at<br>
least one target value. The frequency of the adjustable oscillator is set to substantially<br>
correspond to the target value. The value of the control signal and the target value are<br>
compared, and when the value of the control signal is substantially different from the<br>
target value, a tuning signal is produced to change the resonant frequency of the at least<br>
one resonance circuit.<br>
As should be apparent, the VCO 245 can be calibrated when the LNA 220 is still<br>
uncalibrated, as the preferred (but non-limiting) approach does not require an RF input<br>
signal.<br>
hi general, the calibration signal can control SW1-SW3 for selecting C1-C6 for both<br>
calibration and band selection. Suitable component values for the capacitors and<br>
inductors are a function of the actual application. However, it can be noted in this regard<br>
that integrated circuit 10 coil values, assuming a good Q value, are approximately in the<br>
range of about O.SnH to about 6nH, and the resonant frequency (f0) is defined as the<br>
reciprocal of two pi times the square root of the inductance (L) multiplied by the<br>
capacitance (C).<br>
If the value of L is fixed, then the variation in frequency arises from the achievable<br>
variation of the value of C. Thus, component values for L and C can be quite restricted. If<br>
the value of L is variable or tunable, as in the above-referenced commonly assigned US<br>
6,621,365 Bl, "Method and Apparatus Providing a Dual Mode VCO for an Adaptive<br>
Receiver", Juha Hallivuori and Pauli Seppinen, it becomes possible to provide more<br>
frequency bands over a wider frequency range with one receiver front end.<br>
In order to place this invention into a suitable technological context, reference is made to<br>
Fig. 5 where there is illustrated a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a<br>
wireless communications system that includes at least one mobile terminal or mobile<br>
station (MS) 100 that is suitable for practicing this invention. An exemplary network<br>
operator is also shown having, for example, a network node 30 for connecting to a data<br>
communications network, such as a Packet Data Network or PDN, at least one base<br>
station controller (BSC) 40, and a plurality of base receiver stations (BTS) 50 that<br>
transmit in a forward or downlink direction both physical and logical channels to the<br>
mobile station 100 in accordance with a predetermined air interface standard. Each BTS<br>
50 is assumed to support a cell. A reverse or uplink communication path also exi sts from<br>
the mobile station 100 to the network operator, which conveys mobile originated access<br>
'••j'<br>
requests and traffic. The air interface standard can conform to any suitable standard or<br>
protocol, and may enable both voice and data traffic, such as data traffic enabling Internet<br>
70 access and web page downloads. One suitable type of air interface is based on TDMA<br>
and may support a GSM or an advanced GSM protocol, although these teachings are not<br>
intended to be limited to TDMA or to GSM or GSM-related wireless systems. In fact,<br>
another wireless system and air interface, such as a WCDMA system, may serve at least a<br>
part of the geographical area served by the wireless communication system shown in Fig.<br>
5, and the MS 100 is then in a preferred embodiment a multi-band terminal that is<br>
capable of operating with either the GSM or the WCDMA network. Alternatively, it may<br>
a single-band terminal that operates only with the WCDMA system. The mobile station<br>
100 typically includes a microcontrol unit (MCU) 120 having an output coupled to an<br>
input of a display 140 and an input coupled to an output of a keyboard or keypad 160.<br>
The mobile station 100 may be a handheld radiotelephone, such as a'ceilular telephone or<br>
a personal communicator. The mobile station 100 could also be contained within a card<br>
or module that is connected during use to another device. For example, the mobile station<br>
10 could be contained within a PCMCIA or similar type of card or module that is<br>
installed during use within a portable data processor, such as a laptop or notebook<br>
computer, or even a computer that is wearable by the user. The MS 100 could also<br>
embody, as non-limiting examples, a PDA, or a gaming device, or an Internet appliance<br>
having wireless communications capabilities.The MCU 120 is assumed to include or be<br>
coupled to some type of a memory 130, including a read-only memory (ROM) for storing<br>
an operating program, as well as a random access memory (RAM) for temporarily storing<br>
required data, scratchpad memory, received data, data to be transmitted, and the like. A<br>
separate, removable SIM (not shown) can be provided as well, the SIM storing, for<br>
example, a preferred Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) list and other subscriberrelated<br>
information. The ROM is assumed, for the purposes of this invention, to store a<br>
program enabling the MCU 120 to execute the software routines, layers and protocols<br>
required to operate in the wireless communications system, as well as to provide a<br>
suitable user interface (UI), via display 140 and keypad 160, with a user. The stored<br>
program also is operable for executing a suitable joint calibration procedure for the LNA<br>
220 and the VCO 245. Although not shown, a microphone and speaker can be provided<br>
for enabling the user to conduct voice calls in a conventional manner. The mobile station<br>
100 also contains a wireless section that includes a digital signal processor (DSP) 180, or<br>
equivalent high speed processor or logic or control unit, as well as a wireless transceiver<br>
that includes a transmitter (Tx) 190 and a receiver (Rx) 195 (that contains the LNA 220),<br>
both of which are coupled to the.antenna 105 for communication with the network<br>
operator via the BTS 50. At least one local oscillator (LO), that includes the PLL 240<br>
having the VCO 245, is provided for tuning the transceiver. Data, such as digitized voice<br>
and packet data, is transmitted and received through the antenna 105. While this<br>
invention may be used in the 1.9GHz and 2.1 GHZ WCDMA and the 900/1800 MHz<br>
GSM bands, the teachings of this invention are not restricted for use in any particular<br>
frequency band or bands. This invention is also not restricted to use in any specific type<br>
of wireless architecture, and could be used in, for example, architectures that feature<br>
direct conversion receivers as well as superheterodyne receivers.<br>
In the-presently preferred mobile station 100 embodiment of this invention the receiver<br>
195 is tunable and operates over a plurality of frequency bands of interest, where a<br>
frequency band of interest may include a CDMA frequency band or a TDMA frequency<br>
band. More generally, the frequency band of interest may include any preferred frequency<br>
band including, but not limited to, the GSM, WCDMA, UWB (e.g., 3.1 Ghz and 4.8GHz),<br>
WLAN (e.g., 2.4GHz and 5GHz),- Bluetooth (2.4GHz), DVB-H (e.g., UHF, 470-<br>
838MHz), GPS, FM and RF-ID (e.g., 868MHz) frequency bands.<br>
Based on the foregoing it can be appreciated that embodiments of this invention concern<br>
a receiver design implemented on a single chip and that can include a tunable, wideband<br>
filter coupled to a receiver antenna. The tunable wideband filter is in turn coupled to the<br>
LNA 220, and the output of the LNA 220 is coupled to the frequency selective mixer 230.<br>
Frequency selectivity is achieved by changing the LNA 220 and VCO 245 loads, thus<br>
changing the mixer 230 input resonances. A PLL 240 includes a multiband voltage<br>
controlled oscillator 245 that is coupled to the mixer 230. Since the VCO 245 and LNA<br>
220 have associated resonant circuits implemented in a single chip, they are subject to the<br>
same process variations, hi the preferred embodiments of the invention the components<br>
of the LNA 220 and the VCO 245 are arranged to exhibit a substantially identical<br>
resonant circuit topology, and as a result the same integrated circuit calibration signal<br>
used to calibrate the VCO 245 can likewise be coupled to the LNA 220 for calibration<br>
purposes. One advantageous consequence of this preferred design is that the'selectivity of<br>
the LNA 220 can be substantially increased, eliminating the need for the separate,<br>
off-chip image rejection filter 151 of the prior art.<br>
The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by providing a one-chip<br>
receiver design that eliminates the need for multiple off-chip filters and, in particular, an<br>
off-chip image rejection filter for rejecting unwanted image signals. In the preferred<br>
embodiments the LNA 220 and VCO 245 are fabricated in a single chip over a common<br>
semiconductor substrate, and the LNA 220 and VCO 245 have substantially identical<br>
resonant circuits that are subject to the same chip fabrication process variations. Since the<br>
LNA 220 can be coupled to the VCO 245 for calibration purposes the need for separate<br>
LNA calibration circuitry can be avoided.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of this invention the LNA 220 and the VCO 245 each<br>
comprise calibration/band selection circuitry that is coupled to a band selection signal for<br>
performing-band selection in the. multi-band receiver front end, and the same band<br>
selection signal is preferably used for the VCO 245 and for the LNA 220. In the preferred<br>
embodiments of this invention the calibration signal and band selection signal are the<br>
same signal, since the calibration is performed for a certain frequency which can be<br>
selected according to the band of interest. In this manner the calibration performed for the<br>
process variations, and the band selection, can be accomplished at the same time. The<br>
calibration/band selection circuitry may comprise a tunable inductor.<br>
The foregoing description has provided by way of exemplary and non-limiting examples<br>
a full and informative description of the best method and apparatus presently<br>
contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. However, various<br>
modifications and adaptations may become apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts in<br>
view of the foregoing description, when rread in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings and the appended claims. As but some examples, the use of other similar or<br>
equivalent one-chip front end receiver designs may be attempted by those skilled in the<br>
art, as may specific circuit architectures that deviate form the one shown in Fig. 3.<br>
However, all such and similar modifications of the teachings of this invention will still<br>
fall within the scope of this invention.'<br>
Furthermore, some of the features of the present invention could be used to advantage<br>
without the corresponding use of other features. As such, the foregoing description<br>
should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention, and<br>
