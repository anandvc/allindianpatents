				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An electronic caliper using a low power induced current position transducer includes a slider assembly mounted on an elongated beam with first and second measuring jaws projecting from the main beam and slider assembly. The position of the slider assembly on the beam is indicative of the distance between the first and second jaws. A depth bar is also attached to, and projects from, the slider assembly. Relative movement between the measuring jaws is determined by an inductive read head mounted on the slider assembly that couples to flux modulators on the beam. The read head includes a transmitter winding and a pair of receiver windings carried by a common printed circuit board. The flux modulators, which can include both flux disrupters and flux enhancers, are carried by the beam and modulate the magnetic fields produced by the transmitter. Thus, the receiver windings produce output voltages corresponding to the overlap between the modulators and the receiver windings. Signal processing electronics are connected to the read head and determine the relative positions of the jaws by monitoring the output of the receiver windings. A digital display displays the determined position. In one embodiment, either flux enhancers or flux disrupters are used. In another embodiment, both flux disrupters and flux enhancers are used. The relatively insensitive nature of the low power induced current position transducer to industrial contaminants allows the caliper to function with improved reliability when operating in traditional shop environments.</td>

ELECTRONIC CALIPER USING A LOW POWER INDUCTIVE POSITION TRANSDUCER<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to electronic calipers and more particularly, to electronic calipers employing inductively coupled transducer elements.<br>
2,	Description of Related Art<br>
Electronic calipers are common in manufacturing industries for measuring the thickness or other physical dimensions of an object. The principal component of these electronic calipers is almost universally a capacitive position transducer.<br>
Capacitive transducers draw very little current. Therefore, capacitive transducers are well suited for use in battery-powered measurement tools, such as electronic calipers. Capacitive transducers operate under a parallel plate capacitor model. Within the capacitive transducer, a transmitter electrode and a receiver electrode are mounted on or in a slide. The transmitter electrode is connected to appropriate signal generating circuitry. The receiver electrode is connected to appropriate read circuitry.<br>
The slide moves along a stationary scale. The scale includes a plurality of spaced-apart signal electrodes, which extend along the length of the scale. As the slide moves relative to the scale, the transmitter and receiver electrodes on the slide capacitively couple to the signal electrodes on the scale- The read circuitry determines the movement or position of the slide relative to the scale by comparing the phase of at least one signal coupled to a receiver electrode with the phase of at least one signal coupled to a transmitter electrode.<br>
The capacitive position transducer may be an incremental type transducer or may be an absolute position<br><br>
type transducer. In the incremental type capacitive position transducer, the read circuitry provides only an indication of relative movement from a known point. In the absolute position type capacitive position transducer, the read circuitry provides an indication of the absolute position between the slide and scale. Incremental and absolute position type position transducers are disclosed in U.S. Patents, 4,420,754 and 4,879,508.<br>
These capacitive position transducers are suitable when used in dry, relatively clean environments, such as in inspection rooms or engineering offices- However, these capacitive position transducers are desirably usable ; in calipers to measure dimensions in machine shops, construction sites and other relatively contamination-filled environments. In these environments, capacitive calipers can become contaminated by particulate matter and fluids, such as metal particles, grinding dust, and cooling or cutting fluids. The liquid or ^particulate contaminants find their way between the signal electrodes on the scale and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes on the slide. The contaminants alter the capacitance between the signal electrodes and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes in a manner unrelated to the position of the slide relative to the scale. In general, contaminants between the signal electrodes and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes of a capacitive position transducer cause measurement errors through three different mechanisms. Primarily, the particulate or liquid may have a dielectric constant different from the dielectric constant of air. In this case, the capacitance between the signal electrodes and the transmitter/receiver electrodes sandwiching the contaminant will be greater than the capacitance between other ones of the signal and transmitter/receiver electrodes having the same relative geometry which do not<br><br>
have contaminants between them. As a result^ the caliper will not provide an accurate indication of the position of the slide relative to the scale.<br>
Secondarily/ the contaminants may have a relatively high conductivity. Normally, the signal and transmitter/ receiver electrodes form an open circuit, such that no current flows between them. A conducive contaminant between the signal and transmitter or receiver electrodes closes this circuit. In particular, an RC circuit is formed, the contaminant forming the resistive element. The time constant of the RC circuit thus formed is a function of both the conductivity of the contaminant and the capacitance between the signal electrode and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes. When the time constant is relatively short, the amplitude of the signal may decay so rapidly that the conventional circuitry employed in capacitive position transducers cannot properly sense the signal.<br>
Thirdly, electrically conductive particles between the signal electrode and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes may alter the field extending between the signal electrode and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes which changes the capacitance between the signal electrode and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes. Distortions in the electric field may also cause the signals between the signal electrode and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes to be distorted such that the caliper circuitry does not provide an accurate indication of the position of the slide relative to the scale.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,172,485 to Gerhard et al • describes one approach to minimizing the adverse effects of contaminants in capacitive position transducers - This approach comprises coating the electrodes with a thin layer of dielectric material.  The slide is then mounted<br><br>
on the scale so that the dielectric coating on the slide (transmitter and receiver) electrodes is positioned adjacent to the dielectric coating on the scale (signal) electrodes. That is, placing the dielectric coatings between the signal electrodes and the transmitter and receiver electrodes minimizes these adverse effects. In addition, the dielectric coating on the slide slidingly contacts the dielectric coating on the scale. The sliding contact between the dielectric coatings reduces the gap between the slide and the scale into which the contaminants intrude.<br>
The sliding contact approach requires that the electrodes be resiliently biased toward each other. The resilient bias allows deviations from exact surface flatness and alignment to be accommodated by permitting the electrodes to move apart from each other. This allows the dielectric layers to be forced apart from each other. Thus, when such a capacitive position transducer is used in a highly contaminated environment, contaminants can force the slide away from the scale and collect between the slide and scale. Thus, this approach has not proven to be adequate under some circumstances.<br>
However, using thick dielectric coats, rather than the thin coats taught by Gerhard et al. has reduced, to some extent, the negative effects due to contaminants collecting between the slide and scale. The thick dielectric coats create a pair of capacitors that are connected in series with the capacitance created by the contaminants. Since the capacitance created by the dielectric coats does not vary as the slide moves along the scale, the change in capacitance between the signal electrodes and the transmitter and/or receiver electrodes resulting from changes in the thickness or composition of the contaminants is dominated by the fixed capacitances created by the thick dielectric coats.   Although using<br><br>
thick dielectric coats can reduce the problem caused by dielectric contaminants, this approach cannot completely eliminate the problem.<br>
Another approach isolates the electrodes from the liquid and particulate contaminants. For example, the capacitive position transducer caliper may be sealed. However, sealing the caliper increases the fabrication and assembly costs and is often unreliable• Also, such seals are difficult to practically apply to all sizes and applications of electronic calipers.<br>
Magnetic transducers are alternative types of position measuring transducers. Magnetic transducers are relatively insensitive to contamination caused by oil, water and other fluids, Magnetic transducers, such as the Sony Magnescale encoders, employ a read head that detects magnetic fields and a ferromagnetic scale that is selectively magnetized with one or more periodic magnetic patterns. The read head senses changes in the magnetic field as the read head moves relative to magnetic scale patterns on the scale. However, magnetic transducers themselves are affected by small particles, particularly ferromagnetic particles attracted to the magnetized scale. Consequently, magnetic transducers must also be sealed, encapsulated or otherwise protected to keep contaminants from affecting their accuracy. Magnetic transducers also do not offer the very low power consumption desired for electronic calipers. As a result, magnetic transducers are not used generally in calipers.<br>
Inductive transducers, in contrast to both capacitive and magnetic transducers, are highly insensitive to cutting oil, water or other fluids as well as to dust, ferromagnetic particles, and other contaminants. Inductive transducers, such as the INDUCTOSYNCD type transducers, employ multiple windings on one member to transmit a varying magnetic field received<br><br>
by similar windings on another member-   The multiple<br>
windings  can  be  a  series  of  parallel  hairpin  turns<br>
repeated on a printed circuit board.   An alternating<br>
current  flowing in  the windings  of  the  first member<br>
generates the varying magnetic field.  The signal received<br>
by the second member varies periodically based on the<br>
relative position between the two members.   A position<br>
determining circuit connected to the varying signal from<br>
the second member can determine the relative position<br>
between the first and second members.   However,  both<br>
members  are active.   Therefore,  each member must be<br>
electrically coupled to the appropriate driving circuitry,<br>
which  increases  manufacturing  and  installation  costs.<br>
Additionally, because inductive transducers require both<br>
members to be electrically coupled, inductive transducers<br>
are difficult to incorporate into hand-held devices, such<br>
as calipers.<br>
Other motion or position transducers^ that are<br>
+ insensitive  to  contaminants,  yet  which  can  be  more<br>
inexpensively manufactured than capacitive,  magnetic or<br>
inductive   transducers,   are   described   in   U.S.<br>
Patents. 4,697,144 to Howbrook, 5,233,294 to Dreoni, and<br>
4,743,786  to  Ichikawa  et  al.,  and  British  Patent<br>
Application  2,064,125  to  Thatcher.    These  references<br>
disclose position detection devices that sense position<br>
between an energized member and an inactive or unenergized<br>
member.    The  transducing  systems  described  in  these<br>
references eliminate electrical intercoupling between the<br>
two moving members, a drawback of inductive transducers.<br>
However, these systems generally fail to provide the high<br>
accuracy of inductive or capacitive transducers.<br>
Additionally,  in  some  of  these  transducing<br>
systems, the inactive member is preferably ferromagnetic,<br>
which produces a strong magnetic field.  Alternately, the<br>
inactive member is moved within a magnetic field defined<br><br>
and concentrated by a complex structure formed in or on the active member• Additionally, none of these systems provide the combination of low power operation and sufficient accuracy and measuring range which users demand of calipers. The transducing systems disclosed in these references also, produce output signals which are discontinuous or which are not a simply-prescribed function of position. Such signals contribute to inaccurately determined relative positions over extended distances - Furthermore, the transducing systems disclosed in these references are in other ways poorly suited when incorporated into a caliper.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention thus provides an electronic caliper usable in harsh industrial environments. The electronic caliper of this invention includes transducer elements which are substantially insensitive to particulate and fluid contaminants. The electronic caliper of this invention retains the conventional form, operation, feel, and low power consumption of conventional electronic calipers.<br>
The electronic caliper of this invention " is readily and inexpensively manufactured by using conventional fabrication techniques, such as printed circuit board technology. Furthermore, the transducer of this invention is insensitive to contamination by particles, including ferromagnetic particles, or oil, water, or other fluids. As a result, the transducer avoids using expensive environmental seals while remaining usable in most shop or field environments, A pulses-driven circuit of the electronic caliper of this invention allows the inductive transducer to consume little power. Thus, the caliper of this invention is a hand-held, battery-powered measurement tool deriving a long operating life from a small battery or a solar cell.<br><br>
The electronic caliper of this invention includes a slider mounted on an elongated main beam, as in a conventional configuration. Position measuring jaws pro j ect from each of the main beam and the slider. The position of the slider relative to the main beam is indicative of the distance between the position measuring jaws on the main beam and slider.<br>
The main beam is mechanically coupled to an elongated scale* The elongated scale includes a set of magnetic field or flux modulators extending in a pattern along its length. The slider assembly includes a pickoff assembly. The pickoff assembly includes a read head. Relative movement between the position measuring jaws corresponds to relative movement between the set of magnetic field or flux modulators and the read head. The electronic caliper includes a depth bar which is attached to, and projects from, the slider in the direction of the length of the main beam. The depth bar is used to measure the depth of a hole in a surface.<br>
Low power signal processing electronics are connected only to the read head and are not connected to the set of magnetic field or flux modulators. The ' low power electronics indicate the relative position between the read head and the set of magnetic field or flux modulators as a function of the disruptive effect of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators on the signals produced and received by the read head. Although the electronic caliper configuration of this invention preferably uses a low power inductive transducer with a read head which moves relative to the set of magnetic field or flux modulators, the electronic caliper may also use other types of inductive transducers which are sufficiently accurate, use sufficiently low power, and are similarly insensitive to contaminants.<br><br>
The inductive transducer of this invention includes a magnetic field source preferably having a first path of conductive material. The magnetic field source is able to produce a changing magnetic field or flux. At least one of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators is positioned within the changing magnetic field or flux to spatially vary the magnetic field or flux proximate to the at least one magnetic field or flux modulator. A sensing conductor, formed within a thin zone, forms a periodic pattern of flux-receiving areas. The periodic pattern extends along a measuring axis and is positioned within the changing magnetic field or flux. The changing magnetic field or flux thus passively generates an electro-motive force (EMF) across at least one output of the sensing conductor in response to the changing magnetic field or flux.<br>
The at least one magnetic field or flux modulator and the periodic pattern of the sensing conductor move relative to each other from a first position to a second position. In the first position, a first portion of the periodic pattern overlaps the at least one magnetic field or flux modulator. In the second position, a second portion of the periodic pattern overlaps the at least one magnetic field flux modulator. That is, the at least one magnetic field or flux modulator varies the EMF from the first position to the second position.<br>
The at least one magnetic field or flux modulator cooperates with the periodic pattern of the sensing conductor to produce a continuously varying periodic EMF across the output of the sensing conductor based on continuous relative motion between the at least one magnetic field or flux modulator and the periodic pattern of the sensing conductor. In one embodiment, each one of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators is a flux disrupter formed by an electrically conductive plate.  In<br><br>
another embodiment, each one of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators is a flux enhancer formed from a material having a high magnetic permeability. In another embodiment, the set of magnetic field or flux modulators includes at least one flux disrupter and at least one flux enhancer.<br>
The sensing conductor is preferably formed by a plurality of first loops alternating with a plurality of second loops. The loops are formed of a conductive material. The first and second loops are positioned within the changing magnetic field. Each of the first loops produce a changing first signal component in response to the changing magnetic field. Likewise, each of the second loops produces a changing second signal component in response to the changing magnetic field.<br>
The plurality of first and second loops and the set of magnetic field or flux modulators are movable relative to each other. In a first position, one or more of the first loops may be proximate to corresponding ones of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators, thus altering the first signal components generated by those first loops. In a second position, one or more of " the second loops may be proximate to corresponding ones of the set of magnetic field or flux modulators, thus altering the second signal components produced by those second loops. The first and second signal components indicate the position of each of the first and second loops relative to the set of magnetic field or flux modulators.<br>
Thus, this invention incorporates an inductive sensor with acceptable physical characteristics, accuracy, and power consumption into a practical hand-held, battery-operated caliper. The caliper is insensitive to contaminants such as oil and particles, is suitable for a wide variety of applications, is accurate, and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture, compared to prior<br><br>
v<br>
calipers. These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Fig, 1, an inductive caliper 100 includes an elongated beam 102. The elongated beam 102 is a rigid or semi-rigid bar having a generally rectangular cross section. A groove 106 is formed in an upper surface of the elongated beam 102. An elongated measuring scale 104 is rigidly bonded to the elongated beam 102 in the groove 106, The groove 106 is formed in the beam 102 at a depth about equal to the thickness of the scale 104. Thus, the top surface of the scale 104 is very nearly coplanar with the top edges of beam 102.<br>
A pair of laterally projecting, fixed jaws 108 and 110 are integrally formed near a first end 112 of the beam 102- A corresponding pair of laterally projecting movable jaws 116 and 118 are formed on a slider assembly 120, "The V outside dimensions of an object are measured by placing the object between a pair of engagement surfaces 114 on the jaws 108 and 116. Similarly, the inside dimensions of an object are measured by placing the jaws 110 and 118 within an object. The engagement surfaces 122 of the jaws 110 and 118 are positioned to contact the surfaces on the object to be measured.<br>
The engagement surfaces 122 and 114 are positioned so that when the engagement surfaces 114 of the jaws 108 and 116 are contacting each other, the engagement surfaces 122 of the jaws 110 and 118 are aligned with each other. In this position, the zero position (not shown), both the<br><br>
outside and inside dimensions measured by the caliper 100 should be zero.<br>
The caliper 100 also includes a depth bar 126 which is attached to the slider assembly 120, The depth bar 126 projects longitudinally from the beam 102 and terminates at an engagement end 128, The length of the depth bar 126 is such that the engagement end 128 is flush with a second end 132 of the beam 102 when the caliper 100 is at the zero position. By resting the second end 132 of the beam 102 on a surface in which a hole is formed and extending the depth bar 12 6 into the hole until the end 128 touches the bottom of the hole, the caliper 100 is able to measure the depth of the hole.<br>
Whether a measurement is made using the outside measuring jaws 108 and 116, the inside measuring jaws 110 and 118, or the depth bar 126, the measured dimension is displayed on a conventional digital display 138, which is mounted in a cover 139 of the caliper 100. A pair of push button switches 134 and 136 are also mounted in the cover 139. The switch 134 turns on and off a signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 of the slider assembly 120. The switch 136 is used to reset "the display 138 to zero.<br>
As shown in Fig* 1, the slider assembly 120 includes a base 14 0 with a guiding edge 142. The guiding edge 142 contacts a side edge 14 6 of the elongated beam 102 when the slider assembly 120 straddles the elongated beam 102. This ensures accurate operation of the caliper 100. A pair of screws 147 bias a resilient pressure bar 148 against a mating edge of the beam 102 to eliminate free play between the slider assembly 120 and the elongated beam 102.<br>
The depth bar 126 is inserted into a depth bar groove 152 formed on an underside of the elongated beam 102.  The depth bar groove 152 extends along the underside<br><br>
of the elongated beam 102 to provide clearance for the depth bar 126, The depth bar 126 is held in the depth bar groove 152 by an end stop 154. The end stop 154 is attached to the underside of the beam 102 at the second end 132. The end stop 154 also prevents the slider assembly 120 from inadvertently disengaging from the elongated beam 102 at the second end 132 during operation.<br>
The slider assembly 120 also includes a pickoff assembly 160 mounted on the base 140 above the elongated beam 102. Thus^ the base 140 and pickof f assembly 160 move as a unit. The pickoff assembly 160 includes a substrate 162^ such as a conventional printed circuit board. The substrate 162 bears an inductive read head 164 on its lower surface. A signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 is mounted on an upper surface of the substrate 162. A resilient seal 163 is compressed between the cover 139 and the substrate 152 to prevent contamination of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166.<br>
As shown in Fig, 2, the read head 164 is covered by a thin, durable, insulative coating 167, which is preferably approximately 50mm thick.<br>
The scale 104 includes an elongated printed circuit board 168 as its primary transducing element. As shown in Fig. 1, a set of disrupters 170 are spaced apart along the printed circuit board 168 in a periodic pattern. The disrupters 170 are preferably formed of copper. The disrupters 170 are preferably formed according to conventional printed circuit board manufacturing techniques, although many other methods of fabrication may be used. As shown in Fig. 2, a protective insulating layer 172 (preferably being at most 100mm thick)  covers the disrupters 170. The protective layer 172 can include printed markings, as shown in Fig. 1.<br><br>
The slider assembly 120 carries the read head 164 so that it is slightly separated from the beam 102 by an air gap 174 formed between the insulative coatings 167 and 172. The air gap 174 is preferably on the order of 0*5mm. Together, the read head 164 and the disrupters 170 form an inductive transducer. The inductive transducer is preferably of any suitable type disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 08/441,769, which is incorporated herein by reference, and more particularly of the types described herein. However, the caliper 100 can also use other types of inductive transducers which offer the necessary mechanical packaging attributes, are sufficiently accurate, are low power, and are similarly insensitive to contaminants. Similarly, the caliper 100 can use power conservation methods, such as those disclosed in U*S* Provisional Patent Application 60/015,707, filed April 17, 1996.<br>
The inductive transducer formed by the read head 164 and the disrupters 170 operates, in the first preferred embodiment shown in Figs, 1-3, by generating changing magnetic fields. The changing magnetic fields induce circulating currents, known as eddy currents," in the disrupters 170 placed within the changing magnetic field.<br>
For example, one of the disrupters 170 is placed between the pole faces of an electromagnet. The magnetic field between the pole faces changes with time, such as when the electromagnet is driven by an alternating current. Then, the flux through any closed loop in the disrupter 170 will change. As a result, an electromotive force ("EMF") is induced around the closed loop. Since the disrupter 170 is a conductor, an eddy current is generated whose value equals the EMF divided by the resistance along the loop of the material from which the disrupter 170 is formed.<br><br>
Such eddy currents are dften produced in the magnetic cores of transformers. In transformers, such eddy currents are unwanted because they result in power loss and create heat which must be dissipated. In this invention, however, the existence of eddy currents has been applied to provide a beneficial result.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a section of the read head 164 in greater detail. The read head 164 preferably consists of five substantially coplanar conductors 180-184. Two of the conductors 181 and 182 form a first receiver winding 178. Another two of the conductors 183 and 184 form a second receiver winding 179. The first and second receiver windings 178 and 179 are centrally located on and extend along the substrate 162 in an overlapped manner.<br>
The first and second receiver windings 178 and 179 are each arranged in a sinusoidal pattern and have the same wavelength. The conductor 181 extends from a terminal 185 to an interconnection terminal 189a, where it connects to the conductor 182. The conductor 182 then extends back to a terminal 187. The conductors 181 and 182 forming the first receiver winding 178 define a plurality of sinusoidally shaped loops 191.<br>
In a similar manner, the conductor 183 extends from a terminal 188 to an interconnection terminal 189b, where it connects to the conductor 184. The conductor 184 then extends back to a terminal 186, The conductors 183 and 184 forming the second receiver winding 179 also define a plurality of sinusoidally shaped loops 192. The loops 192 are offset by one-quarter wavelength or one-half of a loop from the loops 191 formed by the first receiver<br>
winding 178.<br>
In Fig. 3, the conductors 181-184 are shown on the same surface of the substrate 162. However, alternate half wavelength sections of each of the conductors 181-184 are actually on separate layers of the substrate 162.<br><br>
Thus, the windings 178 and 179 do not physically contact each other. Similarly, each of the windings 178 and 179 do not physically contact themselves at the "crossover" points in the middle of the pattern. The half wavelength sections of each of the conductors 181-184 are then joined to other half wavelength sections of the same conductor by feedthroughs 190 extending through the substrate 162. While the conductors 181-184 are not on the same surface " of the substrate 162, the conductors 181-184 lie within a thin zone. That is, the distance between the top most layer of the windings 178 and 17 9 on the substrate 162 and the bottom most layer of the substrate 162 is minimal. Therefore, the conductors 181-184 are approximately coplanar.<br>
The second receiver winding 179 is substantially identical to the first receiver winding 178, except for the spatial phase offset. Accordingly, the following discussion will focus primarily on the first receiver winding 178. It should be appreciated that the following discussion applies equally to the second receiver winding<br>
179,<br>
The fifth winding 180 is a transmitter winding that also lies within the thin zone and substantially encircles the first and second receiver windings 178 and 17 9. The transmitter winding 180 is also formed by a conductor on a layer or surface of the substrate 162. The transmitter winding 180 is also formed according to conventional printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The transmitter winding 180 has a length 194 and width 195 sufficient to encircle the first and second receiver windings 178 and 179-<br>
Except as otherwise specified, measurements in Figs. 3 and 4 are defined relative to a measuring axis 300. "Length" generally refers to dimensions extending parallel to the measuring axis 300 and "width" generally<br><br>
refers to dimensions extending perpendicular to the measuring axis 300 in the plane of the substrate 162. The distance spanned by two adjacent loops 191 formed by the first receiver winding 178 or two adjacent loops 192 formed by the second receiver winding 179 is defined as the pitch or wavelength 193 of the read head 164. The distance spanned by a single loop 191 or 192 is equal to one-half of the wavelength 193. The distance 302 spanned by each disrupter 170 is preferably also equal to one-half of the wavelength 193* The one-quarter wavelength offset between the first receiver winding 178 and the second receiver winding 17 9 produces signals in quadrature. Thus, the direction of motion of the read head 164 relative to the scale 104 is observable. Furthermore, the distance 304 spanned from one edge of a disrupter 170 to the corresponding edge of an adjacent disrupter 170 is preferably equal to the wavelength 193. It should be appreciated that if the disrupters all are identical, the edge-to-edge distance 304 can be any integer multiple "K" of the wavelength 193. In the later case, it is preferable that each receiver winding have a length of 'N*K" times wavelength 193, where N is also an integer.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the first receiver winding 178 has a sinusoidal pattern of loops 191. The first receiver winding 178 is formed by the conductors 181 and 182 laid out in one direction in a sinusoidal or zigzag pattern, and then in a reverse direction. Thus, the conductors 181 and 182 physically (but not electrically) cross over each other to form the loops 191. Alternately, the loops 191 can be created by twisting a loop of insulated wire clockwise or counterclockwise 180 degrees at regular increments along the loop. The construction of the second receiver winding 17 9 is identical to the first receiver winding 178.<br><br>
As a result of the cross-over structure of the loops 191, adjacent ones of the loops 191 have different effective winding directions. An alternating current flowing through the transmitter winding 180 produces a uniform, time-varying magnetic field extending through the first receiver windings 178. The time-varying magnetic field generates an EMF in, or time-varying current through, the first receiver winding 178• Thus, the receiver winding 178 functions as a specialized magnetic flux sensor. Since adjacent ones of the loops 191 are wound in alternating directions, the EMF and current ^ generated in adjacent loops 191 have alternating polarities, as indicated by the " + " and "-" symbols in Fig. 4.<br>
Each of the loops 191 encloses substantially the same area. Therefore, if the number of " + " loops 191a equals the number of "-" loops 191b and the loops 191 receive a uniform magnetic flux, the magnetic field induces a net zero EMF across the terminals 185 and 187 of the first receiver winding 178. This is also true for the second receiver winding 179.<br>
If a disrupter 170 on the scale 104, or any other conductive object, is moved close to the read head 164, the magnetic field generated by the transmitter winding 180 will induce eddy currents in the disrupter 170 or the other conductive object. Consequently, a magnetic field is created in the vicinity of the disrupter counteracting the magnetic field generated by the transmitter winding 180. The eddy currents thus generate reverse magnetic fields that attenuate the transmitter magnetic field proximate to the disrupter 170.<br>
As a result, the magnetic flux that the first receiver winding 178 receives is spatially altered or disrupted- So long as the disruption does not equally affect the " + " loops 191a and the "-" loops 191b, the<br><br>
receiver winding 178 outputs a non-zero EMF signal-Consequently, the EMF between the output terminals 185 and 187 will change polarity as the conductive disrupter 170 moves from adjacent to a "+" loop 191a to adjacent to a "-" loop 191b.<br>
The size of the disrupter 170 preferably does not equal the wavelength 193. For example, if the length 302 of the disrupter 170 is equal to the wavelength 193 and the width of the disrupter 170 is equal to the width 195, then, regardless of where the disrupter 170 is positioned along the measuring axis 300 relative to the loops 191, it will disrupt the transmitter magnetic field over equal areas of adjacent "+" loops 191a and "-" loops 191b. As a result, the amplitude of the EMF signal output from the receiver winding 178 will be nominally zero.<br>
Furthermore, the output from the receiver winding 178 will be insensitive to position of the object relative to the loops 191. That is, the output will be zero regardless of the disrupter 170's position along the measuring axis. Since no useful signal results from this geometry, the size of the disrupter 170 preferably does not equal the wavelength 193. The length of " the disrupter 170 could be greater than one wavelength 193. However, because the portion of the disrupter equal to a full wavelength 193 will not contribute to the useful signal strength, the length of the disrupter 170 is preferably less than one wavelength 193.<br>
If the length of the disrupter 170 is not equal to one wavelength 193 or integer multiples of the wavelength 193, then in most positions, unequal "+" and "-" areas of the loops 191 will be disrupted. The signal output will thus be sensitive to the position of the disrupter 170 relative to the loops 191. The signal output will have a largest amplitude change as a function of position when the length of the disrupter 170 is equal to one-half of<br><br>
the wavelength 193 * When the length of the disrupter 170 is one-half of a wavelength 193, the disrupter 170 will periodically cover either an entire " + " loop 191a or an entire "-" loop 191b, but will not cover any portion of an adjacent "-" loop 191b or "+" loop 191a, Thus, a one-half wavelength-long disruptor 170 will produce the strongest possible signal.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the disrupters 170 are arranged on the scale 104 with a pitch (a distance of one edge to the adjacent corresponding edge) of one wavelength 193. Thus, successive disrupters are separated by one-half of a wavelength 193. The disrupters 170 are preferably highly electrically conductive, but not ferromagnetic. Thus, the disrupters 170 do not become magnetized and attract ferromagnetic particles. As shown in Fig. 1, in the first preferred embodiment, the length of the scale 104 exceeds the length of the read head 164. Thus, the length of the scale 104 establishes the measurement range for the caliper 100.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a second preferred embodiment of the caliper 100. In this second preferred embodiment, the caliper 100 is identical to the caliper 100 of the first preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 1, except as outlined below. In the second preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 shown in Fig. 6, the receiver windings 178 and 179 and the transmitter winding 180 are carried by the scale 104 positioned on the main beam 102. The disrupters 170 are positioned within the slider assembly 120, which travels along the scale 104. In this second preferred embodiment of the caliper 100, the read head 164 extends substantially the entire length of the main beam 102. The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 and a power supply are also positioned on the main beam 102, and are electrically connected to the read head 164 by conventional means.<br><br>
In either the first or second preferred embodiments of the caliper 100, the loops 191 of the first receiver winding 178 are preferably placed within a prescribed region in the interior of the transmitter winding 180 - The inventors have experimentally determined that the transmitter winding 180 produces a magnetic field having an intensity that rapidly diminishes as a function of the distance from conductor of the transmitter winding 180, However, the inventors have also experimentally determined that in the interior region of transmitter winding 180, the magnetic field tends to approach a uniform value beyond a certain distance from the conductor of the transmitter winding 180,<br>
The certain distance thus defines the perimeter of a region of relatively uniform magnetic field. The distance at which the magnetic field becomes uniform is a function of the geometry of the winding. Consequently, to improve the accuracy of the inductive transducer of this invention, the loops 191 and 192 are preferably spaced the certain distance away from the transmitter winding 180. The loops 191 and 192 of the first and second receiver windings 178 and 179 are more preferably located entirely within the region of relatively uniform magnetic field.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, the disrupters 170, the receiver windings 178 and 179, and the transmitter winding 180 are dimensioned as follows:<br>
Receiver winding wavelength = 0.200 inch;<br>
Disrupter length = 0.100 inch;<br>
Disrupter width = 0.4 90 inch;<br>
Transmitter winding width = 0.400 inch;<br>
Receiver winding width = 0.340 inch;<br>
One-quarter receiver wavelength = 0.050 inch; and<br>
Transmitter winding length = 1.950 inches.<br>
By   accurately   balancing   and   alternately interleaving the " + " loops 191a and the "-" loops 191b,<br><br>
the first receiver winding 178 has a nominally zero output in the absence of the disrupters 170. At the same time, locating the alternating "+" loops 191a and "-" loops 191b immediately adjacent to each other provides for a continuous signal at each receiver winding output as the disrupter 170 is moved along the measuring axis 300. These design factors provide a high signal-to-noise ratio in the caliper 100. Thus, these features enable high accuracy measurement.<br>
The above^outlined geometry of the first preferred embodiment of the read head 164 and scale 104 ensure that the caliper 100 is highly accurate. Additionally, the above-outlined geometry of the first preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 largely eliminates effects from non-" uniform transmitter fields along the width of the read head 164 perpendicular to the measuring axis 300- The above-outlined geometry also rejects externally applied magnetic fields as "common-mode error" due to the balanced "differential detection" of the inductive transducer of this invention. The degree of accuracy in the first preferred embodiment of the inductive transducer caliper 100 depends largely on the care in the design "and construction of the read head 164 and the scale 104-<br>
Figs. 5A-5C show an example of the operation of the inductive caliper 100. As the scale 104 and its disrupters 17 0 (shown in dashed lines) move relative to the transmitter 180 and the first receiver winding 178, the disrupters 170 cover either all of the " + " loops 191a and none of the "-" loops 191b, varying proportions of the " + " loops 191a and the "-" loops 191b, or all of the "-" loops 191b and none of the ^'+" loops 191a.<br>
Fig. 5A shows the disrupters 170 covering all of the "-" loops 191b and none of the "+" loops 191a of the first receiver winding 178. The transmitter winding 180 inductively couples to and induces eddy currents in the<br><br>
disrupters 170. As a result, the disrupters 170 produce magnetic fields that counteract the transmitter magnetic field passing through the "-" loops 191b. Thus, the net magnetic flux passing through the "-** loops 191b is less than the net magnetic flux passing through the *' + •' loops 191a- The "-" loops 191b therefore generate less induced EMF than the " + " loops 191a* Consequently, the first receiver winding 178 produces a net "positive" polarity current and voltage across its output terminals 185 and 187.<br>
The output signal varies with time because the transmitter winding 180 generates a time-varying magnetic field. The amplitude and polarity of - the time varying output signal relative to the input signal indicates the relative position between the read head 164 and the scale 104. Fig. 5C illustrates how the output signal amplitude and polarity varies as the position of the scale 104 varies relative to the read head 164,<br>
The initial peak in the waveform shown in Fig, 5C is an example of a positive polarity amplitude output across the terminals 185 and 187 of the first receiver winding 178, Polarity indicates the time phase of 'the time-varying output signal relative to the input signal. The polarity of the output signal will be either in phase or inverted (180° out of phase) relative to the input signal.<br>
Fig- 5B shows the scale 104 moved so that the disrupters 170 overlap all of the "+" loops 191a, but none of the "-" loops 191b. In this relative position, the induced current generated in the disrupters 170 counteracts the flux of the transmitter magnetic field passing through the "+" loops 191a. The "-" loops 191b thus generate more induced EMF than the " + " loops 191a-Consequently, the first receiver winding 178 generates a net negative polarity current and voltage at its output<br><br>
terminals 185 and 187. The initial valley in the waveform shown in Fig. 5C is an example of a negative polarity amplitude output across the terminals 185 and 187 of the first receiver winding 178.<br>
When the disrupters 170 completely overlap the '-" loops 191b, as shown in Fig. 5A, the resulting output signal has a maximum positive amplitude, as shown in the peaks in the waveform of Fig. 5C. Conversely, when the disrupters completely overlap the "+" loops 191a, as shown in Fig. 5B, the resulting output signal has a maximum negative amplitude, as shown in the valleys in the waveform of Fig, 5C.<br>
As the disrupters 170 move along the measuring axis 300 between the position shown in Fig, 5A and the position shown in Fig. 5B, the amplitude of the waveform of Fig. 5C varies continuously. In particular, the amplitude of the waveform of Fig. 5C is zero when the disrupters 170 overlap exactly one-half of each of the "+" loops 191a and the "-" loops 191b. From this position, as the disrupters 170 move more closely to the position shown  in Figs. 5A or 5B, the amplitude of the receiver output signal is increasingly positive or negative, respectively.<br>
The first preferred embodiment of the read head 164, as shown in Fig. 3, has two receiver windings 178 and 17 9 spaced one^quarter of the scale wavelength 193 apart from each other. That is, the second receiver winding 179 overlaps the first receiver winding 178 and is offset by one-quarter of the scale wavelength 193. Thus, each " + " loop 192a of the second receiving winding 179 overlaps a portion of a "+" loop 191a and a portion of a "-" loop 191b of the first receiver winding 178. Similarly, each "-" loop 192b of the second receiver winding 17 9 overlaps a portion of a " + *' loop 191a and a portion of a "--" loop 191b of the first receiver winding 178.<br><br>
Insulation or crossover vias are suitably placed on or in the substrate 162, respectively, to electrically isolate the first receiver winding 178 from the second receiver winding 179. By spacing the first and second receiver windings 178 and 179 one-quarter of a scale wavelength 193 apart, the signals from the first and second receiver windings 17 8 and 179 are spatially in quadrature. That is, the signal amplitudes output from the receiver windings 178 and 17 9 define sinusoidal patterns as functions of position. In particular, the sinusoidal pattern of the second receiver winding 17 9 is spatially shifted 90° with respect to the sinusoidal pattern of the first receiver winding 178. As a result, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 detects the relationship between the signals from each of the receiver windings 178 and 179. By analyzing this relationship, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 determines the direction the read head 164 is moving relative to the scale 104. As outlined above, the amplitudes of the signals output by the windings 178 and 179 vary sinusoidally based on the position of the read head 164 relative to the scale 104. Thus, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 determines the position of the read head 164 with respect to the scale 104 by the following equation:<br>
(1)<br><br><br>
SI and S2 indicate the amplitudes and signs of the output signals received from the receiver windings 178 and 17 9, respectively; and<br>
"tan-1" is the inverse tangent function defining an angle between zero and 2n    as a function of the ratio<br>
between Si and S2.  The signs of 31 and 32 define which quadrant the angle lies in according to Table 1.<br><br>
To improve the accuracy of the caliper 100, and/or reduce the demands on the analog signal processing circuitry for the receiver output signal, the read head 164 can include three or more overlapping receiver windings. While a read head 164 having three or more overlapping receiver windings is more difficult to manufacture, it provides, in combination with certain signal processing techniques, more accurate position readings than a read head 164 having only two overlapping receiver windings. Such multiple winding read heads are preferably equally phase-shifted. For example, for a number of windings m, the phase shift will be 180°/m.<br>
The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 7. The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 solves Eq. 1 and controls the electronic operation of the caliper 100. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 is mounted on the substrate 162 as a part of the pickoff assembly 160.  The signal processing and display electronic circuit<br><br>
166 is connected to the read head 164, the switches 134 and 136 and the display 138 in a conventional manner which includes an elastomeric connector 165 for the display connections.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1, 6, 7 and 16, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 uses a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements. However, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 can also be implemented on an ASIC or other integrated circuit, a hardwired electronic or logic circuit such as a discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a PLD, PLA or PAL, or the like. In general, any device which supports a finite state machine capable of implementing the signal processing and display functions described herein can be used to implement the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166.<br>
The signal processing and display circuit 166 preferably comprises a microprocessor 226, which inputs a signal from an A/D converter 224 and generates and outputs control signals to the display 138, the A/D converter 224, a switch 225, a signal generator 200, and a delay circuit 219. The output of the delay circuit 219 is input to the control inputs of a first sample and hold circuit 217 and a second sample and hold circuit 218.<br>
Each of the outputs of first and second sample and hold circuits 217 and 218 are connected to one of the input terminals of the switch 225. The output of the switch 225 is connected to the input of the A/D converter 224. The inputs to the first and second sample and hold circuits 217 and 218 are connected, respectively, to the output terminals 185 and 188 of the first and second receiver windings 178 and 179.<br>
The other output terminals 187 and 186, respectively, of the first and second receiver windings<br><br>
v.,<br>
178 and 17 9 are connected to ground. The output of the signal generator 200 is connected to the terminal 197 of the transmitter winding 180. The other terminal 198 of the transmitter winding 180 is also connected to ground-To perform a position measurement, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 supplies an electrical excitation signal to the transmitter winding 180 of the read head 164.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the first sample and hold circuit 217 has a buffer amplifier 216 which is connected as the output to one. of the terminals of the switch 225. The output terminal 185 of the first receiver winding 178 is connected through a switch 221 to the input of the buffer amplifier 216. The control terminal of the switch 221 is connected to the delay circuit 219 and inputs the ^ sample and hold control signal. A capacitor 230 is connected between ground and the input terminal of the buffer amplifier 216*<br>
The buffer amplifier 222, switch 223, and capacitor 232 of the second sample and hold circuit 218 are connected between the delay circuit 219, the other terminal of the switch 225, the output terminal 188 of "the second receiver winding 17 9 and ground in a corresponding manner.<br>
As shown in Fig• 7, and in greater detail in Fig. 8, the microprocessor 226 is connected to the gate of a transistor 210 of the signal generator 200, A supply voltage V+ is connected through a bias resistor 212 to the drain of the transistor 210. The source of the transistor 210 is connected to ground.<br>
An LC series circuit is formed by a capacitor 214 and the transmitter winding 180. The LC series circuit is connected between the drain of the transistor 210 and ground. When the transistor 210 is off, the capacitor 214 is connected through the  resistor  212  to the  supply<br><br>
voltage V+ and is charged to the supply voltage V+, The supply voltage is preferably supplied by an appropriate power source (not shown) , such as a battery. Together, the power supply V+, the transistor 210, the resistor 212 and the capacitor 214 form the first preferred embodiment of the signal generator circuit 200 of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166•<br>
To turn on the transistor 210, the microprocessor 226 supplies a short pulse to the gate of transistor 210. When the transistor 210 is on, the capacitor 214 is connected to ground through the transistor 210, Because the capacitor voltage cannot change instantly, the voltage at the node A between the capacitor 214 and the transmitter winding 180 is driven to a negative value, ; Then, the capacitor 214 and the transmitter winding 180 resonate with each other at a frequency determined by the capacitance of the capacitor 214 and the inductance of the transmitter winding 180.<br>
During each sampling period of the receiver output signal, the capacitor 214 is discharged and then recharged. To provide sufficient accuracy and motion-tracking capability for the low power induced current transducer used in the first and second preferred embodiments of the caliper 100, a sampling frequency of about IkHz is preferred. The capacitor 214 preferably has a value of InF and the power supply voltage V+ is preferably 3V.<br>
The charge (in coulombs) provided by the power supply voltage V+ is equal to the capacitance of the capacitor times the change in voltage across the capacitor (coulomb = farad-volt), Accordingly, the charge stored by the capacitor 214 is equal to the capacitance of the capacitor 214, InF, times the voltage across the capacitor, 3V, or 3nC.<br><br>
The capacitor will discharge and recharge every sampling period, which is 1ms for a sampling rate of IkHz-Additionally, current is charge divided by time (amp = charge/second). Accordingly, the average current drawn from the power supply during one sampling interval is 3nC/lms=3(aA. Three microamps is a very small current, even for a battery-powered transducer.<br>
Because of the chosen circuit configuration, the signal generator 200 enables the transducer to intermittently provide a strong output signal (about 60mV maximum) across the terminals 185-188 of the receiver windings 17 8 and 17 9* However, because of the circuit and transducer configuration of this invention, and because the driving signal is a short pulse and can operate with a low duty cycle, the inductive caliper of this invention draws a very small average current, even at the desired rapid sampling rate of IkHz, A small average current is required, for a commercially practical electronic caliper.<br>
To minimize power consumption, the input pulse applied to the transistor 210 should be as short as possible, so that the charge lost through the bias resistor 212 is minimized. In the example outlined above, if the pulse length is 1ms and resistor 212 has a value of lOkQ, the average current through the resistor 212 is only 0.3|aA- In general in this invention, the average current used to charge the capacitor 214 is preferrably less than 75µA, and more preferrably less than 10µA-<br>
As shown in Fig, 7, the capacitors 230 and 232 are electrically connected in parallel to the receiver windings 17 8 and 17 9, respectively. The capacitances of the capacitors 230 and 232 form resonant circuits with the inductances of the receiver windings 178 and 179. If the resonant frequency of these resonant circuits is the same as the resonant frequency of the transmitter resonant<br><br>
circuit, the strength of the signal output from the receiver windings is increased and unwanted noise is filtered from the signals.<br>
Since the transmitter winding 180, as an inductor, and the capacitor 214 form a resonant LC circuit, a voltage transient measured at node A will have a decaying resonant behavior, as shown in Fig. 9. The transient voltage signal causes a corresponding current flow in the transmitter winding 180. This, in turn, produces a changing magnetic flux normal to the loops 191 and 192 of the receiver windings 178 and 179, respectively-<br>
The receiver windings 178 and 17 9 each have two conductor portions. As shown in Fig/ 7, these portions are placed at spatial phase positions corresponding to 0° and 180° for the first receiver winding 178, and at 90° and 270° for the second winding 179. As previously described, with the scale 104 and the disrupters 170 in place, a current is induced in the disrupters 170* The field from this induced current results in a net EMF in the receiver windings 178 and 179,<br>
The degree notation in Fig. 7 (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) corresponds to the location of the different p^rts of the windings 178 and 179 relative to a nominal position. The serial connection of the two halves of the first receiver winding 178, for example, causes the voltage at the output of the first receiver winding 178 to have one polarity when the disrupters 170 are in the 0° position. The voltage at the output of the first receiver winding 178 has the opposite polarity when the disrupters 170 are in the 180° position.<br>
The signals from the receiver windings 178 and 179 are transmitted to the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166, The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 analyzes the signals to determine the distance between the jaws 108 and 116, which is also<br><br>
the distance between the jaws 110 and 118, The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 then is connected to, and provides a drive signal to, the display 138 through a conventional elastomeric conductor 165 to provide a digital readout of the measured distance-<br>
Figs, lOA-lOC show the voltage induced across the output of the first receiver winding 178 in response to the transmitter winding's transient voltage excitation, as shown in Fig. 9. In particular. Figs. lOA-lOC show the induced voltage for three different positions of the disrupters 17 0 relative to the loops 191 of the first receiver winding 178. The amplitude and phase of the receiver signal depends on the position of the scale 104 relative to the receiver winding 178 or 179.<br>
The receiver signal shown in Fig- lOA has a peak amplitude at point B. The peak amplitude indicates that the relative position between the scale and the receiver winding 178 or 179 is such that a maximum amplitude signal results - The inventors have experimentally determined that if the inductance of the transmitter winding 180 is 0.5)iH, the capacitance of the capacitor 214 is InF, the gap 174 is approximately 0,5mm, and the power supply voltage V+ is 3V, then the maximum receiver output signal at point B will be approximately 60mV. The LC series circuit formed by the capacitor 214 and the transmitter winding has a resonant frequency of approximately 7MHz.<br>
Fig. lOB shows the receiver signal when the scale 104 is moved 1/4 of the wavelength 193 from the relative position generating the receiver signal shown in Fig. lOA-As shown in Fig, lOB, this relative position between the first receiver winding 178 and the disrupters 170 generates a receiver output signal having an amplitude of zero at point B. This signal corresponds to a position where each disrupter 170 overlaps equal areas of adjacent<br><br>
"+" loops 191a and "-" loops 191b for the receiver winding 178.<br>
In Fig. 10C, the scale has been moved another 1/4 of the wavelength 193 in the same direction, for a total displacement of 1/2 of a wavelength 193 from the relative position generating the receiver signal shown in Fig. lOA. In this relative position, the disrupter 170 overlaps a loop 191 of opposite polarity from the loop 191 corresponding to Fig. lOA. Accordingly the first receiver ■ winding 178 produces a maximum negative amplitude receiver signal at point B.<br>
Figs, llA-G show the signals present at various points of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166. As shown in Figs. IID and HE, the disrupters 170 are positioned relative to the loops 191 and 192 such that the receiver signals output by the receiver windings 178 and 179 are equal and opposite. The equal and opposite receiver signals output by the receiver windings 178 and 17 9 are input to the sample and hold circuits 217 and 218, respectively, of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166.<br>
Fig. HA shows the transmission control signal output by the microprocessor 226 to the gate of the transistor 210. As shown in Fig, HA, the transmission control signal has a duration of t. Fig. IIB shows the resulting oscillating transmitter signal applied to the transmitter winding 180.<br>
Fig. lie shows the sample and hold control signal output from the delay circuit 219. The delay circuit 219 inputs the transmission control signal shown in Fig, HA from the microprocessor 226 to simultaneously initiate the sample and hold control signal. The duration of the sample and hold signal is chosen according to circuit and transducer design parameters, either by analysis or experiment.   In particular, the duration is chosen such<br><br>
that the trailing edge of the sample and hold control signal coincides as closely as possible in time with the amplitudes of the receiver signals reaching point B, as shown in Figs- lOA and IOC. In response to the sample and hold control signal output from the delay circuit 219, the first and second sample and hold circuits 217 and 218 sample the signals from the first and second receiver windings 178 and 179, respectively.<br>
The sample and hold control signal closes the switches 221 and 223 generally simultaneously with the start of the transmission signal being applied to the transmission winding 180. The signals output by the first and second receiver windings 178 and 17 9 appear on the capacitors 230 and 232, respectively, as shown in Figs. IIF and IIG.<br>
At a time nominally chosen to coincide with time B, the sample and hold control signal returns to zero and the switches 221 and 223 open. The voltages across the capacitors 230 and 232 at that instant are then held. In general, the sampled voltage may be held at any time during the receiver signals shown in Figs. IID and HE, except at the zero crossings- The time B is the preferred hold time and occurs when the maximum receiver signal strength is obtained.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. IIB and IIC, this corresponds to a peak of the resonant response. The time B is established by the delay circuit 219, which is, for example, a monostable flip-flop triggered by the transmission control signal.<br>
The sampled voltages are input to the high input impedance buffer amplifiers 216 and 222. The buffer amplifiers 216 and 222 provide gain and isolate the capacitors 221 and 223 to prevent the capacitors 221 and 223 from losing their charge. The buffer amplifiers 216 and 222, respectively, output a signal Si, corresponding to<br><br>
the receiver signal output by the receiver winding 178, and a signal S2, corresponding to the receiver signal output by the receiver winding 17 9. The selector switch 225 alternately couples the outputs of the buffer amplifier 216 or 222 to the A/D converter 224. The A/D converter 224 converts the analog signals Si and S2 to digital signals-<br>
The microprocessor 226 inputs the digital signal from the A/D converter 224, computes a measurement position, and outputs appropriate signals to the display 138. The microprocessor 226 can evaluate the position of the scale 104 in any one of a variety of methods, including the method defined by Equation (1).<br>
The display button logic, the system control logic, analysis of displacements exceeding one wavelength, and other typical electronic caliper functions are preferably provided as in the prior art capacitive electronic calipers, such as those produced by Mitutoyo, Brown &amp; Sharp, Sylvac, Starret, etc. The preferred embodiment displays the measured distance on the display 138, The computed measurement position can also be output to other systems through suitable connections (not shown) similar to those in commercially available capacitive calipers. For example, the computed measurement data may be output to a statistical process control system or to a remote measurement display.<br>
The signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 can be readily incorporated into the hand-held caliper 100 by mounting the elements of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 on the substrate 162. In some cases, a conventional multi-layer printed circuit substrate can be used, so that the internal layers of the substrate can be used to provide conventional ground-plane shielding (not shown) between the read head 164 and the signal processing and display<br><br>
electronic circuit 166- This eliminates unwanted interaction between the electronic signals in these elements-<br>
As shown in Figs. IIA-G, the transmission control signal remains high for several peaks of the resonant response, However, as shown in Figs. 12A-G, the transistor 210 may be turned off after a sufficient period to allow sampling of the capacitor voltages. The transistor 210 does not need to remain on beyond the sampling time.<br>
Thus, to conserve power, the transistor 210 can be turned off before the resonant circuit has dissipated its stored energy. Preferably, as shown in Fig. 12A, the transistor 210 is turned off at time C when the voltage across the capacitor 214 has returned as close as possible to its original value. In the preferred embodiment described above, this original value is the battery voltage V+, as shown in Fig, 12B,<br>
It should also be appreciated that sufficient time must be provided between successive transmission control pulses, in order to allow the capacitor 214 to fully recharge. Generally, if the circuit comprising "the capacitor 214 and the resistor 212 has a time constant Tc, the time allowed between successive transmission control pulses, i.e., the pulse interval of the drive signal, should be at least 4 times the time constant Tc-<br>
A second preferred, and low-power, embodiment of the signal generator 200 is shown in Fig. 13- In the first preferred embodiment of the signal generator 200, energy is lost through the bias resistor 212 when the transistor 210 is turned on. The second preferred embodiment of the signal generator 200 eliminates a substantial part of this energy loss by using an active pull up switch 240 to bias the transistor 210 in place of the bias resistor 212.   This energy loss is minimized<br><br>
because the resistance of the pull up switch 240, when it is open, is much greater than the resistance of the bias resistor 212.<br>
The active pull-up switch 240 also allows the capacitor 214 to be charged much faster. Thus, the low on-resistance of the switch 240 allows a much higher sampling rate compared to the first preferred embodiment of the signal generator shown in Figs • 7 and 8. In the second preferred embodiment of the signal generator 200, the switch 240 and the transistor 210 are controlled by a pair of synchronous control signals-<br>
The microprocessor 226 generates the switch control signal input to the control switch 240 and the transistor 210. The switch control signal to the switch 240 is high when the transmission control signal to the transistor 210 is low. In this condition, the switch 240 is closed and the capacitor 214 is charged to V+ through the transmission winding 180, The transmission control signal to the transistor 210 is low, turning off the transistor 210.<br>
This arrangement prevents the switch 240 and the transistor 210 from conducting at the same time. This prevents a large current draw from the battery and preserves battery life.<br>
When the capacitor 214 is charged, the control switch signal opens the switch 240. Thereafter, the transmission control signal to the transistor 210 turns on V the transistor 210. It should be appreciated that the transistor 210 remains off until after the switch 240 is off so the switch 240 and the transistor 210 do not conduct at the same time.<br>
When the transistor 210 is turned on, the capacitor 214 is connected to ground. The charged capacitor 214 and the transmitting winding 180 form a resonant circuit.  Because the capacitor 214 is charged.<br><br>
the voltage across the transmitter winding 180 resonates as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
The corresponding current through the transmitter winding also generates the changing magnetic field through the receiver windings 178 and 179, The disrupters 170 then induce a net signal in the receiver windings 178 and 179. The delay circuit 219 controls the sample and hold circuit in relation to the transmission signal to transistor 210, as previously described- The amplitude and sign of the net signal will depend upon the position of the disrupters 170 relative to receiver windings 178 and 179.<br>
A high Q-value corresponds to low energy loss in the resonant circuit, A high Q-value is desirable because the voltage across the capacitor 214 swings back closer to the battery voltage V+, Thus, if the transmission control signal is turned off at time C, as shown in Figs. 12A and 14, the voltage across the capacitor 214, Vpeak, will be only slightly below the battery voltage V+. Thus, the battery needs to provide only a small amount of charge to replenish or recharge the capacitor 214 in preparation for the next transmission/reception cycle.<br>
As shown in Figs. 12F and 12G, turning the transmission control signal off at time C does not affect the sampled signals on the capacitors 230 and 232 because the transistor 210 remains on until after the sampling time B.<br>
It is also possible to operate the transducer of this invention in reverse, i.e., to transmit through the windings 178 and 179 and receive, or sense the magnetic flux, through the winding 180, The encoder electronics for this mode of operation are shown in Fig. 30. Fig. 31 is a signal timing diagram showing the timing of the control signals.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 30, the microprocessor 226 controls three selector switches 324, 326, and 328 with the selector control signal. When the selector control signal goes high, the switches 326 and 328 are moved to the positions shown in Fig - 30. In particular, the winding 178 is connected to the signal generator and the winding 180 is connected to the sample-and-hold circuit 217, The S/H control signal is also routed to sample-and-hold circuit 217, Next, the microprocessor 226 outputs a transmission control pulse to the signal generator 200 and to the delay circuit 219. Signal S1 is thus sampled and held by the switch 221 and the capacitor 230.<br>
The microprocessor 226 then changes the selector control signal to low, which moves the switches 326 and 328 to their alternate positions* Thus, the winding 17 9 is connected to the signal generator 200 and the winding 180 is connected to the sample-and-hold circuit 218. The S/H control signal is also routed to sample-and-hold circuit 218, The microprocessor 226 outputs a new transmission control signal to the signal generator 200 and to the delay circuit 219, Signal S2 is thus sampled and held by the switch 223 and the capacitor 232, 'The rest of the signal processing is the same as described in conjunction with Fig. 7.<br>
In the encoder electronics shown in Fig. 30, a single signal generator is used, and is alternately connected to the transmitter windings 178 and 179. It is also possible to use two signal generators, each connected to one of the transmitter windings 178 and 179.<br>
The microprocessor 226 is able to determine an absolute position measurement within one-half of the wavelength 193, using known interpolation routines and only one receiver winding. For example, as shown in Fig. 15, the microprocessor 226 can distinguish between a first position dl and a second position d2 within one-half<br><br>
of the wavelength 193 by comparing the amplitude and polarity of the receiver signal at points 387 and 388, respectively.<br>
The point 387 has a voltage value of VI, while point 388 has a voltage value of V2. The position d3 corresponds to the point 38 9 in the receiver signal shown in Fig. 15, The point 38 9 has the same voltage value VI as the point 387, Therefore, the microprocessor 226 cannot determine the difference in relative position between the first position dl and the third position d3 using the interpolation approach.<br>
In the preferred embodiments described above, the microprocessor 226 resolves such ambiguities by using the signal from the second receiver winding 179 according to well-known quadrature signal analysis techniques, as shown in Eq. (1), For motion beyond one wavelength, the microprocessor 226 detects and accumulates the number of wavelengths traversed from a known starting position, according to well-known techniques, to determine the relative positions of the read head 164 and the scale 104.<br>
The microprocessor 226 supplies pulses at a sampling frequency of about IkHz to provide sufficient accuracy and motion tracking capability. To reduce power consumption, the microprocessor 226 also keeps the duty cycle low by making the pulses relatively short. For example, for the IkHz sampling frequency described above, typical pulse width is about 0,l-l,0µs, That is, the duty cycle of the pulses having sampling period of 1ms is 0.01%-0,1%,<br>
The resonant frequency of the capacitor 214 and the winding 180 is then preferably selected such that the peak of the voltage across the capacitor 214 occurs before the end of the 1, 0|as or less pulse. Thus, the resonant frequency is on the order of several megahertz. The corresponding magnetic flux will therefore be modulated at<br><br>
a frequency above IMHz, and typically of several megahertz. This is considerably higher than the frequencies of conventional inductive transducers.<br>
The inventors have determined that, at these frequencies, the eddy currents generated in the disrupters 170 produce a strong disruptive effect on the magnetic flux. The output EMFs of the receiver windings 178 and 17 9 therefore respond strongly to variations in disrupter position. This occurs despite the low duty cycle and low power used by the pulse signal. The strength of the response, combined with the low duty cycle and low power consumption, allows the caliper 100 to make measurements while the signal generator 200 and the remainder of the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 draw an average current preferably below 200µA, and more preferably below 75µA-   It  should be understood that<br>
"average current" as used herein means the total charge consumed over one or more measurement cycles, divided by the duration of the one or more measurement cycles, while the caliper is in normal use.<br>
The caliper 100 can therefore be operated with an adequate battery lifetime using three or fewer commercially available miniature batteries or with a solar cell.<br>
For an incremental-type transducer, the rate at which the transducer signals are sampled is about 1000 samples per second. The high sampling rate is required for keeping track of the number of wavelengths traveled when the slider assembly 120 is moving quickly. However, the microprocessor 22 6 only needs to update the display 138 with a new measurement value about 10 times per second. Therefore, the power consumption of the caliper can be reduced further if the microprocessor 226 and A/D converter 224 can be relieved of the task of performing high resolution position measurements for a majority of<br><br>
the 1000 samples per second. This can be accomplished by keeping track of the number of scale wavelengths traveled without performing high resolution position measurements-<br>
Fig. 27 shows an example of encoder electronics where a wavelength tracker 320 keeps track of the wavelength number. The wavelength tracker consumes very little power. With a wavelength tracker, the microprocessor 226 can go into a sleep mode when it is not performing a high resolution position measurement and thus not updating the display 138, thereby saving power. A transmit/receive sequencer 322 generates the control signals for the signal generator 200 and the sample-and-hold circuits 217 and 218 by conventional circuit means. The transmit/receive sequencer 322 also generates a strobe pulse for the wavelength tracker 320 and outputs a display update control signal to the microprocessor 226,<br>
The wavelength tracker 320 includes two analog comparators 310 and 312, a quadrature counter 318 and a control logic unit 314. The comparators 310 and 312 detect the zero crossings of the signals Si and S2- A reference voltage Vref is input to each of the comparators 310 and 312. The states of the outputs of the comparators are read into a quadrature counter 318 on command from the wavelength tracker strobe when the outputs of the comparators have stabilized. The quadrature counter 318 counts the number of full wavelengths traveled. The quadrature counter 318 is an up/down counter that is able to detect the direction of movement of the slider assembly 120 due to the fact that the signals Si and S2 are in quadrature, i.e., phase shifted 90°relative to each other. The quadrature counter 318 is a circuit well known in the art. Quadrature counters are, for instance, commonly used to detect the position of optical rotary encoders and linear scales.<br><br>
In operation, the wavelength count held by the quadrature counter 318 has priority over the wavelength count held by the microprocessor 226, However, the microprocessor still determines the relative position within a wavelength. The control logic unit 314 outputs control signals to the microprocessor 226 to switch the microprocessor 226 between a sleep mode and an active mode- In particular, the microprocessor will be put into the sleep mode when the caliper either has not been used for a set period of time or has had the relative position changed very quickly. In this latter case, the quadrature counter 318 can keep up with the rapid movement, but the microprocessor 226 cannot, Because the microprocessor cannot keep up, there is no reason to use it until the movement slows down sufficiently. This operation of the control logic unit, and the structure for implementing it, is well known in the art and thus will not be discussed in greater detail.<br>
Debounce logic (not shown) is also included in the wavelength tracker 320 to prevent erroneous measurements due to edge jitter. Because such debounce logic is well known in the art, it will not be discussed in greclter detail.<br>
Fig. 28 shows a signal timing diagram for the signals output from the transmit/receive sequencer 322, and associated signals. Fig. 29 shows the transmission control signal and the display update control signal.<br>
When the microprocessor 226 updates the display 138 (for example, 10 times per second) it calculates the number of wavelengths traveled from the "zero" position. It reads the number of full wavelengths traveled from the quadrature counter 318. The microprocessor 226 then calculates the fractional wavelength traveled based on the signals Si and S2 output from the A/D converter 224. The fractional wavelength is added to the number of full<br><br>
wavelengths and the result is multiplied by the wavelength to obtain the position value fed to the display.<br>
The transmit/receive sequencer 322 controls sampling of the transducer signals and the wavelength tracker counts the number of wavelengths traveled, without any help from the A/D converter 224 or microprocessor 226. In this embodiment, the caliper is made "quasi-absolute" by only turning off the microprocessor 226, the A/D converter 224, and the display 138 when the caliper is turned off, so that the sampling circuits and the wavelength tracker 318 are still active. When the caliper is turned on again, the wavelength tracker 318 has remained active and provides information regarding the wavelength within which the caliper is positioned, even if the position was moved during the time the caliper was turned off- Thus, the position of the caliper can be computed and displayed with reference to the original "zero" position, despite the fact that the high resolution measurement and display functions of the caliper were turned off.<br>
Figs. 16-18 show a third preferred embodiment of the electronic caliper 100 of this invention, where " the read head 164 and signal processing and display electronics 166 are separated. By separating the read head 164 from the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166, more space may be allowed between the electronic components and the read head elements, which can reduce unwanted electrical crosstalk. This modification may also make manufacturing the unit less costly. Also, fabricating the disrupters 170 integrally with the beam 102 may be desirable.<br>
In this third preferred embodiment, the disrupters 170 are integrally formed in a conductive beam 102' , as shown in Figs. 16 and 18. The upper surface of the conductive beam 102' is etched or machined to form evenly<br><br>
spaced grooves 220, leaving raised portions of the conductive beam 102', The upwardly projecting raised portions of the conductive beam 102' thus form the disrupters 170. An insulative layer 172 is formed over the upper surface of the conductive beam 102' and covers the disrupters 170 and the grooves 220, An air gap 174 is provided between the insulative coating 157 of the read head 164 and the insulative layer 172 - The size of the air gap 17 4 is preferably the same as in the first preferred embodiment, i.e., on the order of O.5mm.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17, the read head 164 is carried by the substrate 162, as described above. However, the signal processing and control electronic circuit 166 is mounted on a separate substrate 262 within the slider assembly 120. Both of the substrates 162 and 262 are enclosed by the cover 139. The resilient seal 163 engages the separate substrate 262. A conventional high-density connector 165_;_ connects the read head 164 and signal processing and display electronic circuit 166.<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, power for operating the caliper 100 is drawn from a conventional solar cell 227 mounted on the upper surface of the cover 139. 'The conventional solar cell 227 is a commercially available component and supplies adequate power to operate the low power inductive transducer caliper 100.<br>
The first, second and third preferred embodiments of the caliper 100, as described above, include flux disrupters 170 to interact with the read head 164 to provide the measurement signal. In a fourth preferred embodiment, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20, a flux enhancer 170', which "enhances" or increases the magnetic flux through the adjacent portions of the receiver windings 178 and 179, is used in place of the flux disrupters 170.<br>
Except as noted below, the fourth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 shown in Figs. 19 and 20 can<br><br>
use any of the read head geometries, circuits and mechanical configurations disclosed in the first, second or third preferred embodiments. In all cases, it should understood that when a flux enhancer 170* is used in place of a flux disrupter 170, the magnetic field will be enhanced rather than disrupted.<br>
That is, the flux density is increased and the polarity of the resulting signals will be inverted when the flux enhancers 170' are used, relative to the effects generated when the flux disrupters 170 are used. In either case, the flux enhancer 170' or flux disrupter 170 spatially modulates the magnetic flux.<br>
The enhancement-type caliper 100 shown in Figs. 19 and 20 enhances the magnetic flux by moving an object of high magnetic permeability, such as ferrite, close to the read head 164. The flux enhancers 170' provide a lower reluctance path for the varying magnetic field generated by the transmitter winding 180, As a result, the magnetic flux that the receiver windings 17 8 and 17 9 receive is altered or enhanced in the vicinity of the flux enhancers 170' . This causes the receiver windings 178 and 179 to output non-zero EMF signals-<br>
Consequently, if the flux enhancers 170' each have a length equal to 1/2 of the wavelength 193, the signal measured at the output terminals 185-188 of the receiver windings 178 and 179 will change polarity and amplitude as the flux enhancers 170* move between the "+" and "-" loops 191a and 191b of receiver winding 178 and 192a and 192b of receiver winding 17 9. Thus, the enhancement-type caliper 100 of the fourth preferred embodiment operates in a manner completely analogous to the above described signal behavior resulting from disrupters 170 used in the first, second and third preferred embodiments of the caliper 100.<br>
If high permeability objects such as the enhancers 170' are moved relative to the read head 164, the regions<br><br>
of higher flux density through the receiver windings 178 and 179 interact with successive ones of the loops 191 and 192. The AC amplitude of the signal output from the receiver windings 178 and 179 will depend upon the difference between the area of the "+" loops 191a and 192a overlapped by the flux enhancers 170' and the area of the "-" loops 191b and 192b overlapped by the flux enhancers 170' .<br>
As the flux enhancers 170' travel along the ; measuring axis 300, the AC amplitudes of the signals output from the receiver windings 178 and 179 vary continuously due to the continuous relationship between the overlapped areas of the " + " loops 191a and 192a and the overlapped areas of the "-" loops 191b and 192b, The signals will also vary periodically with the wavelength 193 due to the periodically alternating "+" and "-" loops 191a and 191b of the receiver winding 178 and 192a and 192b of receiver winding 179, as shown in Fig. 3, and the dimension and placement of the flux enhancers 170' •<br>
The signals output from the receiver windings 178 and 179 have smooth, continuous, sinusoidal shapes based on the movement of the flux enhancers 170' relative to the receiver windings 178 and 17 9. Continuous signals enable the caliper 100 to make accurate position readings over extended distances.<br>
In the fourth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 shown in Figs. 19 and 20, the scale 104 includes multiple flux enhancers 170' positioned on and spaced apart along the substrate 168', The flux enhancers 170' are rectangular members having high magnetic permeability. The flux enhancers 170' are preferably formed from a non-conductive, e.g,, highly resistive material, such as ferrite.  The flux enhancers 170' are<br><br>
also  non-magnetized,  so  that  they  do  not  attract ferromagnetic particles.<br>
The substrate 168' is preferably formed from a material having a substantially lower magnetic permeability than the material of the flux enhancers 170'. Similarly to the flux disrupters 170, the flux enhancers 170' preferably have a length equal to one-half of the wavelength 193 and are arranged at a pitch equal to one wavelength 193, The thickness of the flux enhancers 270' is preferably on the order of 1.5mm- The resulting signal strength is comparable to that of a disrupter-type caliper 100.<br>
Although the flux enhancers 170' can be thicker or thinner than 1.5mm, thicker flux enhancers 170' will provide a greater signal strength. The actual thickness  of the flux enhancers 170' will be determined by the tradeoff between the desired signal strength and the material and manufacturing costs.<br>
The substrate 168' is preferably non-conductive, as in the first and second preferred embodiments. However, the substrate 168' may be more or less conductive depending on manufacturing considerations. The flux enhancers 170' are shown in Figs. 19 and 20 as formed from a material separate from the beam 102 and the substrate 168' - However, as in the third preferred embodiment of the caliper 100, the flux enhancers 170' can be integrally formed with the beam 102'. In this case, the flux enhancers 170' will be formed by processes which alter the permeability of the portions of the material of the beam 102' which form the flux enhancers 170'.<br>
As shown in Fig. 21, in a fifth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100, the flux enhancers 170' are formed as raised or protruding portions of the beam 102' . Preferably a surface contouring process is used to form the protruding portions -  Thus, as in the third preferred<br><br>
embodiment of the caliper 100 shown in Fig. 18, the enhancers 170' are integrally formed from the same material as the beam 102*,<br>
The close proximity of the flux enhancers 17 0' to the read head 164 decreases the magnetic path reluctance for the magnetic flux in the vicinity of the flux enhancers 170' - This effect is comparable to the permeability variation between the substrate 168', the flux enhancers 170' and the empty spaces in the fourth preferred embodiment shown in Figs, 19 and 20. This allows the fifth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 to operate substantially similarly to the fourth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100 of Figs. 19 and 20.<br>
In a sixth preferred embodiment of the caliper 100, as shown in Fig. 22, the beam 102' (or the substrate 168') includes a plurality of less magnetically permeable segments 233, such as alumina, alternating with a plurality of high-permeability, highly resistive segments 234, such as ferrite. The beam 102' or the substrate 168' is thus formed by the series of alternating segments 233 and 234 bonded to form an alternating stack of material. The relatively more magnetically permeable, non-conductive segments 234 define the flux enhancers 170' and provide a lower reluctance path than the less magnetically permeable segments 233-<br>
It should be appreciated that the less magnetically permeable segments 233 can be formed from a conductive material, for example, copper or brass. In this case, the less magnetically permeable segments are also disrupters 170. Therefore, the beam 102' or the substrate 168' includes two types of flux modulators: the flux disrupters 233 and the flux enhancers 234.<br>
Similarly, the flux enhancers 170' (234) and the flux disrupters 170 (233) can be alternately placed along the surface of the beam 102' or the substrate 168' as<br><br>
shown in Fig. 23. In this seventh preferred embodiment of the caliper 100, the effects on the receiver signals caused by the disrupters 17 0 (233) and the enhancers 170' (234) will be roughly additive, producing a stronger signal than when either type of flux modulator is used alone.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 24, the flux disrupters 170 (233) and the flux enhancers 170' (234) can be provided on a base 102 or on the substrate 168* . Additionally, as in the third or fifth embodiments, the flux disrupters 170 (233) or the flux enhancers 170' (234) can be provided integrally with the base 102' or the substrate 168' , as shown in Figs. 25 and 26. In this case, the other of the flux disrupters 170 (233) and the flux enhancers 170' (234) are inserted into the grooves 220.<br>
All of the geometric design principles and circuits disclosed above for the flux-disrupter type calipers of the first, second and third preferred embodiments can of course be used with the flux-enhancement type calipers 100 of the fourth-seventh preferred embodiments to produce the high accuracy and other benefits the first-third preferred embodiments of the caliper 100 provide. The various read head geometries , described above, as well as the circuits and mechanical configurations disclosed above, can all be employed to provide substantial accuracy improvements to prior art "enhancer-type encoders" when the flux enhancers 17 0' are substituted for the flux disrupters 170. The low-power circuit techniques described above can also be used with the flux enhancers 170' while retaining their low^power benefits.<br>
Although specific embodiments of, and examples for, this invention have been illustratively described, various  equivalent  modifications  can  be  made  without<br><br>
departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. For example, while sinusoidal loops 191 and 192 are shown and described with respect to the receiver windings 178 and 179, various other geometries can be effectively used, including different geometries for different phases in a given read head.<br>
Similarly, while generally rectangular conductive bars and rectangular high permeability bars are shown and described herein as two types of spatial flux modulators, other geometries can be used. When these geometries lead to non-sinusoidal output signals as a function of displacement, then the actual function can be modeled in a look-up table, or by other means known to those skilled in the art. The position calculating equations described herein can be similarly modified or replaced according to well-known signal processing techniques.<br>
Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the sampling frequency can be chosen to be higher or lower that that described above^ depending upon the desired accuracy and a maximum expected rate of movement of the slide relative to the scale.<br>
Also, the signal processing and display electronic circuit 166 described herein includes only exemplary analyzing circuits. One skilled in the art will recognize that other circuits may be devised to drive the transmitter winding 180 and to detect signals from the receiver windings 178 and 17 9. Also, one skilled in the art will recognize that, due to the symmetry of the electromagnetic principles disclosed above, the operating role of transmitter winding 180 and receiver windings 178 and 179 can be reversed, as outlined above.<br>
Those skilled in the art will further recognize that the electronic components handling the high frequency signals are preferably located as close as possible to the transducer while  the  electronics  handling  the  low<br><br>
frequency signals can be more remotely located from the transducer. The high frequency electronics include, for example, the circuits used to drive the transmitter windings and to detect the signals from the receiver winding. The low frequency electronics include, for example, those circuits downstream of the sample and hold circuit. In particular, when the transducer excitation frequency is IMHz or greater, at least the signal generating circuits and the demodulating circuits should be positioned on the read head 164.<br>
