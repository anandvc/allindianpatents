INTAGLIO PRINTING PRESS<br><br><br>
KOMORI CORPORATION of 11-1, AZUMABASHI TOKYO, JAPAN JAPANESE Company<br><br>
3-CHOME,  SUMIDA-KU,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
12 JUL 2004<br><br>
23-9-2005<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an intaglio printing press. Description of the Related Art<br>
An intaglio printing press is configured as shown in FIG. 12 and functions as- follows. A sheet feeder 10 feeds a sheet 1 onto a sheet feeder table 21. A swing arm shaft pregripper 22 transfers the sheet 1 to a transfer cylinder 23. The sheet 1 is then transferred to an impression cylinder 31 via a transfer cylinder 24.  Ink fountain units 34a to 34d feed ink to an intaglio cylinder 32 via ink form rollers 33a to 33d, respectively. A wiping roller 37 removes excess ink from the intaglio cylinder 32, and then ink is transferred to the sheet 1 held on the impression cylinder 31 to thereby perform multicolor printing (4-color printing) on the sheet 1. Subsequently, the sheet 1 is transferred from the impression cylinder 31 to a delivery cylinder 41.  The sheet 1 undergoes gripping change from the delivery cylinder 41 to a gripper<br><br><br>
bar of a chain 44. The sheet 1 is transported on the chain 44 as the chain 44 is run by means of rotation of sprockets 42 and 43.  The thus-printed sheets 1 are delivered onto delivery units 45.  (Refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open {kokai)   No. 2001-096722).<br>
In such an intaglio printing press, as many ink fountain units and ink form rollers as possible; specifically, four ink fountain units 34a to 34d and four ink form rollers 33a to 33d, are disposed around the intaglio cylinder 32 to perform printing in as many colors as possible; specifically, in four colors. Notably, multicolor printing (4-color printing) making use of all of the ink fountain units 34a to 34d\and the ink form rollers 33a to 33d is not performed very frequently.  In most cases, ordinary printing (3-color printing) is performed by use of, for example, the ink fountain units 34a to 34c among the ink fountain units 34a to 34d, and the ink form rollers 33a to 33c among the ink form rollers 33a to 33d.<br>
In the above-mentioned intaglio printing press, excess ink to be removed from the intaglio cylinder 32 by means of the wiping roller 37 is of a relatively large amount.  Thus, a wiping liquid, contained in a wiping tank 38, used to clean the wiping roller 37 becomes unclean in a relatively short period of time, thereby increasing the frequency of replacing the wiping liquid, the frequency of regenerating the wiping liquid, or the frequency of a like operation. A conceivable measure to cope with the problem is to provide a pre-wiping<br><br>
unit upstream of the wiping roller 37 with respect to the rotational direction of the intaglio cylinder 32 to scrape most of excess ink from the intaglio cylinder 32, thereby slowing down contamination of the wiping liquid and thus reducing the frequency of replacing the wiping liquid, the frequency of regenerating the wiping liquid, or the frequency of a like operation.<br>
However, since as many ink fountain units and ink form rollers as possible; specifically, the ink fountain units 34a to 34d and the ink form rollers 33a to 33d, are disposed around the intaglio cylinder 32, a space for disposing the pre-wiping unit is not available around the intaglio cylinder 32. In  order to dispone the pre-wiping unit, the ink fountain unit 34d and the ink form roller 33d, which are the ink fountain unit and the ink form roller located furthest downstream with respect to the rotational direction of the intaglio cylinder 32, must be removed.<br>
Thus, when a user is to purchase an intaglio printing press, the user has no other choice but to select either an intaglio printing press that performs ordinary printing (3-color printing) with pre-wiping, or an intaglio printing press that performs multicolor printing (4-color printing) without pre-wiping.<br>

In the present embodiment, the wiping roller 37, the wiping tank 38, and other members constitute wiping means according to the present invention.<br>
An ink unit 110, which serves as ink means according to the present invention, is disposed downstream of the ink fountain unit 34c, which is the ink fountain unit located furthest downstream with respect to the rotational direction of the intaglio cylinder 32, and upstream of the wiping roller 37 with respect to the rotational direction of the<br><br>
intaglio cylinder 32. The ink unit 110 indirectly abuts the<br>
intaglio cylinder 32 via the ink form roller 33d. A position<br>
where the ink form roller 33d and the intaglio cylinder 32<br>
contact serves as an ink supply/collection point. The ink<br>
unit 110 is located in the vicinity of the wiping roller 37<br>
(no other member is present on the circumferential surface of<br>
the intaglio cylinder 32 in a region between the ink unit 110<br>
and the wiping roller 37) and is configured as shown in FIGS.<br>
2 to 9.	<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 to 5, an ink fountain roller 111, which serves as a roller according to the present invention, is in contact with the ink form roller 33d, which is the ink form roller located furthest downstream with respect to the rotational direction of the intaglio cylinder 32. The ink fountain roller 111 is rotatably supported by movable frames 112. The movable frames 112 can slide along corresponding guide members 112a, which are bolted to corresponding stationary frames 110a of a printing press body, such that the ink fountain roller 111 moves in a radial direction of the ink form roller 33d (in the A-B direction in FIG. 2).<br>
A support bed 113, which serves as a support member according to the present invention, is located in the vicinity of the ink fountain roller 111 and is supported by the movable frames 112 in a pivotally movable condition via a support shaft 114.  Wall plates 115 are disposed on the support bed 113 at corresponding widthwise opposite ends. The wall plates 115 are removably attached to the support bed<br><br>
113 by means of fixing bolts 116, which extend through the wall plates 115 and are screw-engaged with the support bed 113. A bottom plate 117 is disposed on the support bed 113 between the wall plates 115.<br>
Flange plates 118 are fixed to the proximal end of the bottom plate 117.  Each of the flange plates 118 has a U-shaped groove 118a. The bottom plate 117 is removably attached onto the support bed 113 as follows: lock screws 119, which are screw-engaged with the support bed 113, are engaged with the corresponding U-shaped grooves 118a; and lock bolts 120, which extend through the support bed 113 from underneath, are engaged with the bottom surface of the bottom plate 117. Adjustment screws 121 are provided on the support bed 113 and used to adjust the clearance between the distal end of the bottom plate 117 and the ink fountain roller 111.<br>
A rotative shaft 122 is located in the vicinity of the support bed 113 and is rotatably supported by the movable frames 112 via corresponding bearings. Eccentric sleeves 123 are unitarily fitted to the rotative shaft 122.  Each of the eccentric sleeves 123 is formed such that the end of an operation rod 124 can be removably fitted into the outer surface of the eccentric sleeve 123. The operation rod 124 can also be removably fitted into a hole 113a formed in the support bed 113.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 6 to 9, an ink collection pan 131 is disposed on the support bed 113 from which the wall plates 115 and the bottom plate 117 have been removed-.<br><br>
Flanges 132 having bolt holes formed therein are fixed to corresponding widthwise opposite ends of the ink collection pan 131. Flange plates 133 each having a U-shaped groove 133a formed therein are fixed to the proximal end of the ink collection pan 131.<br>
The ink collection pan 131 is removably attached onto the support bed 113 as follows: the fixing bolts 116, which are also used to fix the wall plates 115 onto the support bed 113, extend through the flanges 132 and are screw-engaged with the support bed 113; the lock screws 119, which are screw-engaged with the support bed 113, are engaged with the corresponding U-shaped grooves 133a; and the lock bolts 120, which extend through the support bed 113 from underneath, are engaged with the bottom surface of the ink collection pan 131.<br>
A doctor blade 134, which serves as a blade according to the present invention, is attached to the distal end of the ink collection pan 131.  The doctor blade 134 abuts the outer circumferential surface of the ink fountain roller 111 so as to scrape adhering excess ink from the ink fountain roller 111.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, position-fixing screws 126 extend through corresponding widthwise opposite end portions of the support bed 113.  The position-fixing screws 126 are screw-engaged with corresponding female-threaded members 127, whieh are rotatably provided on the corresponding movable frames 112 at corresponding predetermined positions.  In this marines-, the support bed 113 can be fixed such that the upper surface"<br><br>
of the support bed 113 is set at a predetermined angular position (at a predetermined angle of inclination).<br>
In the case where the wall plates 115 and the bottom plate 117 are attached onto the support bed 113, the operation rod 124 is fitted into the hole 113a\of the support bed 113. Then, by use of the fitted operation rod 124, the support bed 113 is pivotally moved about the support shaft 114 to incline its upper surface to a predetermined major angular position (a position for supplying ink to the ink fountain roller 111). The position-fixing screws 126 are screw-engaged with the corresponding female-threaded members<br>
127, thereby fixedly retaining the support bed 113 at the<br>
inclined position and thus facilitating supply of ink to the<br>
ink fountain roller 111.<br>
In the case where the ink collection pan 131 is attached onto the support bed 113, the operation rod 124 is fitted into the hole 113a of the support bed 113.  Then, by use of the fitted operation rod 124, the support bed 113 is pivotally moved about the support shaft 114 to incline its upper surface to a predetermined minor angular position (a position for collecting ink from the ink fountain roller 111) , whereby the support bed 113 is caused to rest on the oute? surfaces of the sleeves 123 via bolts 125.  Such positioning of the ink collection pan 131 facilitates collection of Ink from the ink fountain roller 111.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, distal ends of hydraulic cylinders 128 are connected to the corresponding movable<br><br>
frames 112. Adjustment screws 129, which are rotatably supported by the corresponding stationary frames 110a, are screw-engaged with corresponding proximal ends of the hydraulic cylinders 128.<br>
In the case where the wall plates 115 and, the bottom plate 117 are attached onto the support bed 113, the rods of the hydraulic cylinders 128 are expanded or retracted to thereby slide the movable frames 112 (in the A-B direction ir FIGS. 2 and 6) in relation to the corresponding stationary frames 110a via the corresponding guide members 112a, whereby the ink fountain roller 111 can be moved toward or away from the ink form roller 33d.<br>
In the case where the ink collection pan 131 is attached onto the support bed 113, the operation rods 124 are fitted into the corresponding eccentric sleeves 123. Then, by use of the fitted operation rods 124, the rotative shaft 122 is rotated. As a result, the eccentric sleeves 123 are rotated eccentrically in relation to the axis of the rotative shaft 122, thereby pivotally moving the support bed 113 about the support shaft 114. The pivotal movement of the support bed 113 changes the angular position (the angle of inclination) of the upper surface of the support bed 113, whereby the distal end of the doctor blade 134 can be moved toward or away from the ink fountain roller 111-. By use of the adjustment screws 121, the condition of contact of the distal end"of the doctor blade 134 with the ink fountain roller 111 can be adjusted.<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, an oscillating roller 39d is disposed in the vicinity of the ink fountain roller 111. The oscillating roller 39d is rotatably supported via unillustrated eccentric bearings. The oscillating roller 39d can be positioned as follows: in the case where the wall plates 115 and the bottom plate 117 are attached onto the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110, the oscillating roller 39d is positioned in contact with the ink fountain roller 111 (see FIG. 2); and in the case where the ink collection pan 131 is attached onto the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110, the oscillating roller 39d is positioned away from the ink<br>
fountain roller 111 (see FIG. 6) .<br><br>
In the present embodiment, the wall plates 115, the<br>
bottom plate 117, and other members constitute an ink fountain according to the present invention; the rotative shaft 122, the eccentric sleeves 123, the operation rods 124, the bolts 125, and other members constitute second support-bed-retaining means according to the present invention; the position-fixing screws 126, the female-threaded members 127, and other members constitute first support-bed-retaining means according to the present invention; the ink collection pan 131, the doctor blade 134, and other members constitute pre-wiping means according to the present invention.  However, no particular limitation is imposed on members used to constitute the ink fountain and these means. Any members m§y be used so long as they yield actions and effects similar to those of the above-described members of the present<br><br>
embodiment.<br>
Next will be described operation of the thus-configured intaglio printing press of the present embodiment.<br>
In the case of performing 4-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping, first, the wall plates 115 and the bottom, plate 117 are attached onto the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110 as described above.  The support bed 113 is pivotally moved such that its upper surface is inclined at a predetermined major angular position (a position for supplying ink to the ink fountain roller 111) . The support bed 113 is fixedly retained at the position.  By means of the adjustment screws 121, the condition of contact of the distal end of the bottom plate 117 with the ink fountain roller 111 is adjusted.  The oscillating roller 39d is positioned to come into contact with the ink fountain roller 111.<br>
The sheet feeder 10 feeds the sheet 1 onto the sheet feeder table 21. The swing arm shaft pregripper 22 transfers the sheet 1 to the transfer cylinder 23. The sheet 1 is then transferred to the impression cylinder 31 via a transfer cylinder 24.  The ink fountain units 34a to 34c and the ink unit 110 feed ink to the intaglio cylinder 32 via the ink form rollers 33a to 33d, respectively.  The wiping roller 31 removes excess ink from the intaglio cylinder 32, and then ink is transferred to the sheet 1 held on the impression cylinder 31 to thereby perform 4-color printing on the sheet 1. Subsequently, the sheet 1 is transferred from the impression cylinder 31 to the delivery cylinder 41.  The<br><br>
sheet 1 undergoes gripping change from the delivery cylinder 41 to a gripper bar of the chain 44. The sheet 1 is transported on the chain 44 as the chain 44 is run by means of rotation of the sprockets 42 and 43. The thus-printed sheets 1 are delivered onto delivery units 45. When three-color printing (ordinary printing) with pre-wiping is to be performed, the position-fixing screws 126 engaged with the corresponding female-threaded members 127 are loosened to be disengaged from the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110.  The distal end of the bottom plate 117 is moved away from the ink fountain roller 111. The wall plates<br>
115 and the bottom plate 117 are removed from the support bed<br>
V 113. The ink collection pan 131 is attached onto the support<br>
bed 113 as mentioned previously.  The support bed 113 is<br>
pivotally moved such that its upper surface is inclined at a<br>
predetermined minor angular position (a position for<br>
collecting ink from the ink fountain roller 111), and is<br>
retained at the position in the previously mentioned<br>
condition. The operation rods 124 are fitted into the<br>
corresponding eccentric sleeves 123 and operated to bring the<br>
distal end of the doctor blade 134 into contact with the ink<br>
fountain roller 111.  By means of the adjustment screws 12l,<br>
the condition of contact of the distal end of the doctor<br>
blade 134 with the ink fountain roller 111 is adjusted.  The<br>
oscillating roller 39d is positioned so as to separate from<br>
the ink fountain roller 111.<br>
The sheet feeder 10 feeds the sheet 1 onto the sheet<br><br>
feeder table 21. The swing arm shaft pregripper 22 transfers the sheet 1 to the transfer cylinder 23. The sheet 1 is then transferred to the impression cylinder 31 via the transfer cylinder 24.  The ink fountain units 34a to 34c feed ink to the intaglio cylinder 32 via the ink form rollers 33a to 33c, respectively. The doctor blade 134 provided on the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110 scrapes most of excess ink from the intaglio cylinder 32 to thereby collect ink in the ink collection pan 131.  Subsequently, the wiping roller 37 removes slightly remaining excess ink from the intaglio cylinder 32, and then ink is transferred to the sheet 1 held on the impression cylinder 31 to thereby perform 3-color printing on the sheet 1.  Subsequently, the sheet 1 is transferred from the impression cylinder 31 to the delivery cylinder 41. The sheet 1 undergoes gripping change from the delivery cylinder 41 to a gripper bar of the chain 44. The sheet 1 is transported on  the chain 44 as the chain 44 is run by means of rotation of the sprockets 42 and 43. The thus-printed sheets 1 are delivered onto delivery units 45.<br>
The intaglio printing press of the present embodiment includes the ink unit 110 that allows selective provision of a set of the wall plates 115, the bottom plate 117, and other members or a set of the ink collection plate 131 and other members.  Specifically, when the wall plates 115, the bottom plate 117, and other members are provided on the support bed 113, the ink fountain roller 111 can supply ink to the intaglio cylinder 32, thereby enabling 4-color printing<br><br>
(multicolor printing) without pre-wiping. When the ink collection plate 131 and other members are provided on the support bed 113, the ink fountain roller 111 can collect ink from the intaglio cylinder 32, thereby enabling 3-color printing (ordinary printing) with pre-wiping. Thus, the intaglio printing press of the present embodiment can perform both 3-color printing (ordinary printing) with pre-wiping and 4-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping, so that, when a user is to purchase an intaglio printing press, the user does not need to select either a function of 3-color printing (ordinary printing) with pre-wiping or a function of 4-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping.<br>
Also, the same members 116, 119, and 120 can be used to attach the wall plates 115 and the bottom plate 117 to the support bed 113 of the ink unit 110 and to attach the ink collection pan 131 to the support bed 110.  In other words, the same attachment structure is employed for attaching the ink fountain to the support bed 113 and for attaching the pre-wiping means to the support bed 113, thereby suppressing production cost and facilitating the work of changing the ink fountain to and from the pre-wiping means.<br>
Also, since the intaglio cylinder 32 is a triple-diameter cylinder, application of sufficient printing pressure is facilitated in contrast to the case of employment of a double-diameter cylinder where application of sufficient printing pressure is difficult; and the size of a printing<br><br>
press can be reduced in contrast to the case of employment of a quadruple-diameter cylinder where the size of a printing press increases.<br>
In the present embodiment, the ink collection pan 131 integrally provided with the doctor blade 134 i,s attached to the support bed 113.  However, the present invention is not limited thereto.  For example, as shown in FIG. 10, an ink collection pan 231 and an attachment bed 235 may be provided. The attachment bed 235 has a front-end engagement portion 235a and a rear-end engagement portion 235b; is unitarily provided with a doctor blade 234; and is removably attached onto the support bed 113. The front-end engagement portion 235a is removably engaged with a front end portion of the ink collection pan 231, and the rear-end engagement portion 235b is removably engaged with a rear end portion of the ink collection pan 231. In other words, the ink collection pan 231 is removably supported in relation to the doctor blade 234, so that the ink collection pan 231 can be readily attached or detached without use of a tool or the like.  Thus, ink collected in the ink collection pan 231 can be efficiently disposed of.<br>
In the present embodiment, a set of the wall plates .115 and the bottom plate 117 or a set of the ink collection pan 131 and the doctor blade 134 is selectively attached ontd the support bed 113.  However, the present invention is not limited thereto.  For example, a support bed to which wall plates and a bottom plate are attached, and a support bed to<br><br>
which an ink collection pan and a doctor blade are attached may be interchangeably mounted on the support shaft 114.<br>
In the present embodiment, the ink form rollers 33a to 33c abut the outer circumferential surface of the intaglio cylinder 32. However, the present invention is not limited thereto.  For example, as shown in FIG. 11, the ink form rollers 33a to 33c may indirectly abut the outer circumferential surface of the. intaglio cylinder 32 via a collective ink cylinder 36.  In other words, the ink unit 110 may be disposed downstream of the collective ink roller 36 and upstream of the wiping roller 37 with respect to the rotational direction of the intaglio cylinder 32.  In FIG. 11, reference numerals 35a to 35c denote Intermediate rollers.<br>
The above embodiment is described while mentioning an intaglio printing press that performs 4-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping and 3-color printing (ordinary printing) with pre-wiping.  However, the present invention is not limited thereto. The present invention can be applied to an intaglio printing press that performs multicolor printing (printing in n colors (n: 2 or greater integer"s) without pre-wiping and fewer-color printing (printing in n - 1 colors) with pre-wiping; for example, an intaglio printing press that performs 3-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping and"2-color pointing (fewer-color printing) with pre-wiping, and an intaglio printing press that performs 2-color printing (multicolor printing) without pre-wiping and 1-color printing (fewer-<br><br>
