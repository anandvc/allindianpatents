ELECTRICALLY HEATED DPF/SCR 2-WAY SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to particulate filters and more<br>
particularly to regeneration techniques of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not othen/vise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0003] A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are<br>
typically filtered from a diesel exhaust gas by a particulate filter (PF). The PF is<br>
disposed in an exhaust system of a corresponding diesel engine. The PF<br>
reduces emissions of particulate matter (soot) that is generated during a<br>
heterogeneous combustion process. Over time, the PF becomes full and<br>
trapped diesel particulates must be removed. During a regeneration process, the<br>
diesel particulates are burned within the PF.<br>
[0004] An engine control system can estimate the particulate<br>
accumulation and determine when the filter needs regeneration. Once it is<br>
determined that the filter is full or filled to a predetermined level of particulate, the<br>
1<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
control system enables regeneration by modifying tine combustion process and/or<br>
injecting fuel into the exhaust system. The fuel is injected into the exhaust<br>
stream after a main combustion event. The post-injected fuel is combusted over<br>
one or more catalysts of the PF. The heat released during combustion of the<br>
injected fuel on the catalysts increases the exhaust temperature, which bums the<br>
trapped soot particles in the PF. The elevated exhaust temperatures initiate<br>
oxidation of the stored soot within the PF. This approach can result in higher<br>
temperature excursions than desired, which can be detrimental to exhaust<br>
system components including the PF.<br>
[0005] To minimize nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, portions of the PF<br>
may have selective catalyst reduction (SCR) elements. This type of PF is<br>
sometimes referred to as a 2-way diesel particulate filter (DPF)/SCR element.<br>
Although the 2-way DPF/SCR element reduces costs of an exhaust system, the<br>
performance of the SCR elements during regeneration is significantly reduced. A<br>
regeneration process can require 20-30 minutes of time to complete. During this<br>
period a majority of the PF is heated to temperatures of approximately 600-<br>
650°C. At these temperatures, the efficiency of the SCR elements to remove<br>
NOx is substantially reduced and thus the SCR elements are considered<br>
inactive.<br>
SUiVlMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an exhaust system may include a canister that is<br>
disposed downstream from an engine. A particulate filter (PF) is disposed within<br>
2<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
the canister and filters particulates within an exhaust from the engine. A<br>
reducing catalyst is disposed within the canister, is on the PF, and promotes<br>
reaction of a liquid reductant in the exhaust after reception by the PF. A heating<br>
element is disposed within the canister and heats particulate matter in the PF.<br>
[0007] In other features, a particulate filter (PF) is disposed<br>
downstream from an engine and filters particulates within an exhaust from the<br>
engine. A reducing catalyst coats at least a portion of the PF and promotes<br>
reaction of a liquid reductant in the exhaust. A heating element heats particulate<br>
matter in the PF.<br>
[0008] In yet other features, a method of performing a regeneration<br>
process within an exhaust system includes passing an exhaust from an engine<br>
through a heating element. Particulate matter in a particulate filter (PF) is heated<br>
via the heating element. Particulates from the exhaust are filtered with the PF. A<br>
liquid reductant is reacted with the exhaust via a reducing catalyst on the PF.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
[0024] Referring to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an exemplary<br>
diesel engine system 10 including an exhaust particulate filter (PF) system 12 is<br>
shown. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration system described<br>
herein can be implemented in various engine systems that have a particulate<br>
filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct<br>
injection engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine<br>
systems.<br>
[0025] The engine system 10 includes a diesel engine 13, an intake<br>
manifold 14, a common rail fuel injection system 16 and an exhaust system 18.<br>
The engine 13 combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. The<br>
engine 13 includes eight cylinders 22 configured in adjacent cylinder banks 24,<br>
26 in V-type layout. Although FIG. 1 depicts eight cylinders (N = 8), it can be<br>
appreciated that the engine 13 may include additional or fewer cylinders. For<br>
example, engines having 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated.<br>
It is also anticipated that the particulate filter regeneration control of the present<br>
invention can be implemented in an inline-type or another type of cylinder<br>
configuration.<br>
[0026] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 14 through a throttle. Air is<br>
drawn into the cylinders 22 from the intake manifold 14 and is compressed<br>
therein. Fuel is injected into cylinders 22 by the common rail injection system 16<br>
and the heat of the compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture. The exhaust<br>
gases are exhausted from the cylinders 22 into the exhaust system 18. In some<br>
6<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
instances, the engine system 10 can Include a turbocharger that uses an exhaust<br>
driven turbine 30 to drive a compressor 32 that compresses the air entering the<br>
intake manifold 14. The compressed air typically passes through an air cooler<br>
(not shown) before entering into the intake manifold 14.<br>
[0027] The exhaust system 18 includes exhaust manifolds 34, 36,<br>
exhaust conduits 38, 40, and 42, and the PF system 12, which for the<br>
embodiment shown may be referred to as a diesel PF system. The exhaust<br>
manifolds 34, 36 direct the exhaust exiting corresponding cylinder banks 24, 26<br>
into the exhaust conduits 38, 40. Optionally, an EGR valve re-circulates a<br>
portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold 24. The remainder of the<br>
exhaust is directed into the turbocharger to drive the turbine 30. The turbine 30<br>
facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the intake manifold 14.<br>
A combined exhaust stream flows from the turbocharger through the exhaust<br>
conduit 42 and the PF system 12. When included, the exhaust may flow through<br>
the conduit 42, through a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 43, receives a liquid<br>
reductant via a liquid reductant injector 44, and through a mixer 45 prior to<br>
entering the PF system 12. The liquid reductant may include urea, ammonia, or<br>
some other liquid reductant. Liquid reductant is injected into the exhaust stream<br>
to react with NOx to generate water vapor (H2O) and N2 (nitrogen gas).<br>
[0028] The PF system 12 includes a heating element 52 and a<br>
PF/selective catalyst reduction (SCR) element 54, which are within a housing 55.<br>
The PF/SCR 54 may be referred to as a 2-way element or a 2-way PF and is<br>
shown as a diesel particulate filter (DPF)/SCR for the stated embodiment. The<br>
7<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
PF/SCR element 54 may include a catalyst substrate/flow converter, which is<br>
best seen in FIG. 7. The PF system 12 filters particulates from the combined<br>
exhaust stream from the exhaust conduits 38, 40 prior to entering the<br>
atmosphere. The PF system 12 promotes reaction between a liquid reductant<br>
and NOx. The PF system 12 may also oxidize the exhaust based on the post<br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of<br>
the exhaust.<br>
[0029] The heating element 52 increases the temperature of the front<br>
surface of the PF/SCR element 54, which initiates burning of collected soot<br>
therein. The PF/SCR element 54 receives exhaust from the engine 13 and filters<br>
soot particulates present in the exhaust. The PF portion of the PF/SCR element<br>
54 may be formed of ceramic material, a silicon carbide material, a metallic<br>
material, or other suitable materials.<br>
[0030] A control module 60 regulates operation of the system 10<br>
according to the oxygen based particulate filter regeneration method of the<br>
present disclosure. The system 10 may include various sensors 62, such as<br>
exhaust temperature sensors 64, exhaust flow sensors 66, Make air flow<br>
sensors 68, oxygen level sensors 70, fuel pressure sensors 72, air-fuel sensors<br>
74, and other sensors 76 for status determination and control of the system 10.<br>
The control module 60 determines when regeneration is needed and controls<br>
engine operation to allow regeneration to occur. Based on status signals<br>
received from the sensors 62, the control module 60 controls engine operation at<br>
regeneration levels throughout the regeneration process.<br>
8<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
[0031] A control module 60 controls the engine 13 and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed information. More specifically, tlie control module 60<br>
estimates loading of the PF/SCR element 54. When the estimated loading<br>
achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter) and the<br>
exhaust flow rate is within a desired range. Current is controlled to the heating<br>
element 52 and provided via the control module 60 and a power source 80 to<br>
initiate the regeneration process. The current from the power source may be<br>
supplied directly to the heating element 52, as shown, or supplied to the control<br>
module 60 prior to being received by the heating element 52. The duration of the<br>
regeneration process varies based upon the amount of particulate matter within<br>
the PF/SCR 54. It is anticipated, that the regeneration process can last between<br>
2-6 minutes.<br>
[0032] Current is applied to the heating element 52 during an initial<br>
portion of the regeneration process. More specifically, the electric energy heats<br>
a front surface 82 of the PF/SCR element 54 for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2<br>
minutes). Exhaust passing through the front surface 82 is heated. The<br>
remainder of the regeneration process is achieved using the heat generated by<br>
combustion of particulate matter present near the front surface 82 or by the<br>
heated exhaust passing through the PF/SCR element 54. For a further<br>
explanation or examples of zoning and heating element control see U.S. patent<br>
serial application No.11/233450 filed on March 22, 2006 and entitled, "Zoned<br>
Heated Inlet Ignited Diesel Particulate Filter Regeneration", which is incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
9<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
[0033] Referring to FIG. 2, a perspective view of an example<br>
grid/heating element 100, as applied to a front surface 102 of a PF/SCR element<br>
104 is shown. The heating element 120 may be of various shapes and sizes and<br>
arranged in various configurations and patterns. For example, the width W of the<br>
heating element or conductive path thereof may vary per application. Although<br>
the heating element 120, as shown, has a single positive connector 106 and a<br>
single negative connector 108, it may have any number of connectors. Also, any<br>
number of heating elements may be incorporated. As another example, each<br>
connector pair and heating element and/or segmented portion thereof may be<br>
associated with a particular coverage zone on the front surface 102. Heating of<br>
the front surface 102 via multiple zones reduces the electrical impact on a PF<br>
system during regeneration. Each zone can be heated separately by supplying<br>
power to a pathway of resistive material located within each zone. In one<br>
embodiment, the heating element 100 is formed from a sheet of electrically<br>
resistive material, such as a metallic material, an example of which is stainless<br>
steel. The heating element may be stamped, milled, cut using a waterjet cutting<br>
machine, or formed using some other suitable technique.<br>
[0034] By dividing the front surface 102 into multiple heated zones, the<br>
material of the heating element 100 can be dispersed more uniformly to evenly<br>
heat the front surface 102. This minimizes the cross-sectional area of a<br>
particular heated area and broadens soot combustion to adjacent channels. As a<br>
result, the total particulate matter consumed is maximized, while the amount of<br>
initially heated area and the amount of electrical power used for such heating is<br>
10<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
minimized. Within each zone, it is also appreciated that the heating element 100<br>
may form resistive pathways or bands of material. The resistive pathways may<br>
be porous or have holes for exhaust flow therethrough. It is further appreciated<br>
that each of the zones may be heated sequentially, simultaneously, or selectively<br>
on an as needed basis.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIGs. 1 and 2, the control module 60 controls<br>
the heating of each zone individually. Switches 120, when incorporated, may be<br>
selectively activated and deactivated to allow current to flow to each zone. For<br>
example, voltage is supplied via the power source 80 to the switches 120.<br>
[0036] Referring to FIG. 3, a cross-sectional side view of a PF system<br>
150 is shown. The PF system 150, as shown includes a grid 154 and a PF/SCR<br>
element 156, which are coupled in series. The grid 154 and the PF/SCR element<br>
156 are butted to each other and are held in place via a mat 158, which in turn is<br>
held by a housing 160. The mat 158, which is a semi-soft flexible sleeve, is<br>
wrapped around and tightly holds the grid 154 and the PF/SCR element 156.<br>
The mat 158 is then enclosed within the housing 160, which may be a welded<br>
can or canister, as shown. The mat 158 may be formed of an insulating material,<br>
such as vermiculite or other insulating material.<br>
[0037] The PF system 150 also includes electrical contact terminals<br>
170, which are coupled to the grid 154. A connector 172 connects insulated<br>
wires 174 via pins 175 to the terminals 170. Electrical energy is supplied via the<br>
wires 174 to each of the terminals 170. The connector 172 is coupled to the<br>
11<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
housing 160. The terminals 170 are sealed to the mat 158 via a high<br>
temperature conductive seal 176.<br>
[0038] Note that the grid 154 may also be attached to the PF/SCR<br>
element 156 using various fasteners and/or fastening techniques. The attaching<br>
of the grid 154 to the PF/SCR element 156 controls movement of the heating<br>
element 154 when current is applied thereto. When temperature of the heating<br>
element 154 increases, the material of the heating element 154 expands. Since<br>
the heating element 154 may have a maximum operating temperature of<br>
approximately between 700-1000°C, the heating element 154 or portions thereof<br>
may exhibit a significant amount of shape change or lateral movement. The<br>
expansion movement is within the laterally planar section of the PF system 150<br>
in which it is positioned. The use of fasteners aids in preventing or limiting such<br>
movement. The fasteners also prevent short circuits between adjacent portions<br>
of the heating element. In one embodiment, the fasteners are placed along the<br>
heating element or resistive/conductive path thereof at predetermined intervals,<br>
such as 2-5 centimeter intervals. Examples of such attachment are described<br>
with respect to the embodiments of FIGs. 8 and 9. The fasteners may be in the<br>
form of pins, barbed pins, plugs, tabs, clips, etc. The fasteners may be formed of<br>
metal or other suitable materials.<br>
[0039] The PF/SCR element 156 may be a monolith particulate trap<br>
and includes alternating inlet cells/channels 184 and outlet cells/channels 186.<br>
The cells/channels 184, 186 extend axially along the PF/SCR element 156.<br>
Walls 188 of the PF/SCR element 156 may include a porous ceramic honeycomb<br>
12<br><br>
GM Reference No, P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
wall of cordierite material. It is appreciated that any ceramic comb material is<br>
considered within the scope of the present invention. Adjacent channels are<br>
alternatively plugged at each end as shown at 190. This forces the diesel<br>
aerosol through the porous substrate walls which act as a mechanical filter.<br>
Particulate matter is deposited within the inlet channels 184 and exhaust exits<br>
through the outlet channels 186. Soot particles 192 flow into the PF/SCR<br>
element 156 and are trapped therein.<br>
[0040] The outlet channels 186 or other portions of the PF/SCR<br>
element 156 may include SCR materials and/or elements. For example, the<br>
inner walls 194 of the outlet channels may be coated with SCR materials. This is<br>
best seen in FIG. 4. The SCR materials may include vanadium, zeolites, or other<br>
suitable SCR materials.<br>
[0041] Referring to FIG. 4, a cross-sectional view of a portion 200 of a<br>
PF/SCR element, such as the PF/SCR element 156, is shown. The portion 200<br>
includes multiple inlet cells/channels 202 and outlet cells/channels 204, which<br>
have associated channel walls 206. The inlet channels 202 have inlets 208 and<br>
the outlet channels 204 have outlets 210. The inlet channels 202 are In an<br>
alternating arrangement relative to the outlet channels 204. The inlet channels<br>
202 have outlet plugs 212 and the outlet channels 204 have inlet plugs 214. The<br>
outlet plugs 212 and the inlet plugs 214 may be integrally formed as part of the<br>
walls 206.<br>
[0042] The walls 206 may include and/or be coated with SCR<br>
materials. As shown, the walls 206 include SCR layers 215 coated thereon. The<br>
13<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
walls 206 perform as filters and as a catalyst for an entering engine exhaust,<br>
designated by arrow 216. The exhaust 216 enters the inlets 208 and passes<br>
fronn the inlet channels 202 to the outlet channels 204 through the walls 206.<br>
The walls 206 prevent particle matter 220 from entering the outlet channels 204.<br>
Thus, the matter collects in the inlet channels 202 against the walls 206. The<br>
SCR catalyst in the walls 206 promotes the reaction of liquid reductant with NOx<br>
in the exhaust gas to form H2O (water vapor) and N2 (nitrogen gas). A gaseous<br>
or liquid reductant, such as ammonia or urea, may be added to the exhaust. The<br>
liquid is then absorbed onto the walls 206.<br>
[0043] To remove the collected particle matter or soot 220, inlet<br>
regions 230 proximate to the inlets 208 are heated via a heating element(s) 231,<br>
When the exhaust 216 is heated in the inlet region 230, the collected particle<br>
matter in that region ignites to create a flame. An example of the flame is shown<br>
and designated 232. The flame is generated from the burning of the particle<br>
matter travels along and within the associated inlet channels of the PF/SCR<br>
element. This heating may be generated via an electrical interface, such as one<br>
or more heating elements, as described in more detail herein. The heating is<br>
accomplished with minimal electrical power. The heating provides uniform heat<br>
distribution and limited peak temperatures within the PF/SCR element, thereby<br>
preventing damage to the PF/SCR element. The heating may be performed<br>
during a low fuel consumption regeneration cycle. In other words, a minimal<br>
amount of fuel may be injected in the exhaust system and/or PF system during<br>
regeneration of the PF/SCR element.<br>

[0044] Referring to FIGs. 5A-C, front view and side views illustrating<br>
zone heating of and thermal energy propagation in a PF/SCR element 250 are<br>
shown. In FIG. 5A, a centrally located zone 252 is shown, which may be<br>
selected and heated in a regeneration process. Note that the front surface of the<br>
PF/SCR element 250 may be divided into any number of zones. The front<br>
surface of a selected zone is heated to ignite particulate matter near that front<br>
surface. The ignition/thermal energy generated propagates longitudinally along<br>
the PF/SCR element 250.<br>
[0045] FIGs. 5A and 5B, illustrate ignition/thermal energy of particulate<br>
matter in the PF/SCR element 250 during different moments in time of the<br>
regeneration process. FIG. 5A, provides an example of ignition of a first portion<br>
254 of the PF/SCR element 250 at approximately 15s from initial ignition of the<br>
front surface. FIG. 5B, provides an example of ignition of a second portion 256<br>
of the PF/SCR element 250 at approximately 30s from initial ignition of the front<br>
surface. Time to perform the regeneration process may vary per application.<br>
[0046] Note that a small percentage of the PF/SCR element 250 is<br>
ignited at any instance in time. Thus, a significant portion of the PF/SCR element<br>
250 may perform as a catalyst and remove NOx. In one embodiment, 20% of the<br>
front surface is heated and thus 3-5% of the PF/SCR element 250 is being<br>
ignited and is thus in a SCR deactive state. The remaining 95-97% is in a SCR<br>
active state. When in a SCR active state, that associated portion of the PF/SCR<br>
element 250 is operating in a temperature range suitable for NOx removal. For<br>
example, portions of the PF/SCR element 250, which are not ignited, may be<br>
15<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
operating in a temperature range of approximately 200-300°C. This allows SCR<br>
materials to be active in removing NOx. As another example, when the active<br>
volume of the PF/SCR element 250 is active and when the SCR materials of the<br>
PF/SCR element 250 are 97% efficient in removing NOx, the NOx removal<br>
efficiency of the PF/SCR element 250 during regeneration may be approximately<br>
equal to or greater than 90%.<br>
[0047] Referring to FIG. 6, a graph illustrating a temperature profile<br>
within the length of a catalyst substrate or PF during a cold start emission test is<br>
shown. The catalyst substrate has multiple catalyst bricks, which are coupled in<br>
series. A contact point between a front catalyst brick and a rear catalyst brick is<br>
represented by a spike in temperature differences at 0.05m. The spike is caused<br>
by a misalignment between channels of the catalyst bricks. Multiple curves 50<br>
are shown and represent time in seconds, as provided by the key 52. The<br>
curves 50 provide a relationship between the difference in Tgas and Tsow for the<br>
PF versus channel length or position along the longitudinal length of the channel.<br>
Tgas is the temperature of the exhaust and Tsoiid is the temperature of the<br>
substrate.<br>
[0048] As can be seen from the graph, a large temperature loss occurs<br>
at a front surface of the PF, due to turbulent heat transfer at the inlets of the PF<br>
or cell entrance locations. The front surface corresponds with channel length 0.<br>
The hot exhaust gas heats up the front surface of the PF where the flow is highly<br>
turbulent. The hot exhaust gas heats the front surface until a thermal equilibrium<br>
is met over time. Since the flow of the exhaust becomes laminar a short distance<br>
16<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
down the channels of the PF, the heat transfer loss decreases. Thus, the rear<br>
surface of the PF, where the exhaust flow is laminar, experiences a gradual<br>
change in temperature with time. The Tgas/Tsoiid temperature difference<br>
approaches 0 near the rear surface. For this reason, the rear surface<br>
experiences smaller thermal losses than the front surface.<br>
[0049] Thus, a heating element is used to raise the temperature of the<br>
substrate to oxidize the soot on the front surface. This prevents heating element<br>
energy loss due to convective heating of the exhaust gas, which then flows thru<br>
the substrate walls and out "clean" cold outlet channels thereof.<br>
[0050] When a PF heating element is used to heat the front surface of<br>
the PF, the temperature of the heating element is increased to exceed an ignition<br>
point of the soot. Heating a front surface of a PF to a hot enough temperature<br>
that allows particulate matter to burn creates a flame front that propagates down<br>
or longitudinally along the channel of the PF cleaning the soot from the filter. The<br>
PF may be formed of electrically resistive material, which provides an efficient<br>
technique to generate heat. However, thermal losses to a cooler exhaust gas, as<br>
well as radiant heat loss to metal exhaust pipes increases the electrical power<br>
used to meet desired ignition temperatures. When the heating element receives<br>
turbulent exhaust flow, a significant amount of heat loss is exhibited, which<br>
reduces the temperature of the heating element. A large portion of this heat loss<br>
is radiant heat loss.<br>
[0051] Radiant heat loss is energy emitted from a high temperature<br>
object and is usually infrared light. Since particulate matter requires high<br>
17<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
temperatures for combustion, the radiant heat losses are a significant source of<br>
lost energy. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power loss due to radiant<br>
energy is proportional to the fourth power of a temperature difference between<br>
emitting and absorbing surfaces, ie: QRAD ~ A ( TH'*~T L'* ). QRAD is radiant heat<br>
loss, A is the Stefan-Boltzmann law constant, TH is the temperature of the<br>
heating element, and T L is the temperature of the exhaust gases and/or other<br>
components near the heating element. Because the heating element<br>
temperature needed to initiate soot burn is high, the heating surface radiant heat<br>
loss associated with the heating element is high.<br>
[0052] To contain or reflect this radiant energy and utilize this energy to<br>
facilitate the burning of the soot, catalyst substrate/flow converter<br>
implementations are used, as described below. To achieve high heating element<br>
temperatures needed for soot ignition, with minimum electrical power, convective<br>
losses to exhaust gas flow are minimized. This is done by converting turbulent<br>
exhaust flow to laminar exhaust flow. A flow converter converts turbulent flow<br>
into laminar flow prior to reception by a heating element. In the below described<br>
embodiments, radiant energy losses are reduced by allowing the radiant energy<br>
to reflect and/or be contained on a surface of a shielding substrate near a heating<br>
element. Hence conductive heat losses to an exhaust piping are reduced, and<br>
the radiant energy is contained near the heating element itself. The stated<br>
energy reflection and containment significantly improves the electrical efficiency<br>
of regenerating a PF.<br>

[0053] Referring to FIG. 7, a cross-sectional side view of a PF system<br>
150' is shown. Ttie PF system 150', as shown includes a flow converter 152, the<br>
grid 154 and the PF/SCR element 156, which are coupled in series. The flow<br>
converter 152, the grid 154 and the PF/SCR element 156 are butted to each<br>
other and are held in place via a mat 158', which in turn is held by a housing<br>
160'. During the manufacturing of the PF system 150' the flow converter 152, the<br>
grid 154 and the PF/SCR element 156 are butted together and held in place.<br>
This assures that the grid 154 is held between the flow converter 152 and the<br>
PF/SCR element 156. The mat 158' is wrapped around and tightly holds the flow<br>
converter 152, the grid 154 and the PF/SCR element 156.<br>
[0054] Note that the grid 154 may also be attached to the flow<br>
converter 152 or the PF/SCR element 156. The heating element 154 may be<br>
attached to the flow converter 152 or the PF/SCR element 156 using various<br>
fasteners and/or fastening techniques some of which are described herein. The<br>
attaching of the grid 154 to the flow converter 152 or the PF/SCR element 156<br>
controls movement of the heating element 154 when current is applied thereto.<br>
[0055] The flow converter 152 may include a catalyst substrate, such<br>
as a diesel oxidizing catalyst (DOC). As such, the flow converter 152 may<br>
perform as a heat shield and oxidize exhaust based on a post combustion air/fuel<br>
ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of the exhaust. In one<br>
embodiment, the flow converter 152 includes and/or is an open cell/channel<br>
substrate and the PF/SCR element 156 includes and/or is a closed cell/channel<br>
19<br><br>

substrate. The flow converter 152 has an internal flow through configuration<br>
whereas the PF/SCR element 156 performs as a filter.<br>
[0056] Use of the flow converter 152, alleviates the above-described<br>
radiant thermal losses and maintains laminar exhaust flow on the heating<br>
element 154. The flow converter 152 converts turbulent exhaust flow into<br>
laminar exhaust flow prior to reception by the heating element 154. This<br>
improves the heating element efficiency by allowing laminar exhaust flow over<br>
the surfaces of the heating element 154.<br>
[0057] The flow converter 152 is configured similar to the PF 156.<br>
However, the flow converter does not have endplugs and is thus in a flow<br>
through configuration. The flow converter 152 may undergo one or more various<br>
processes to improve the radiant reflective properties thereof. For example, the<br>
flow converter 152 may be metallically coated. The flow converter 152 may<br>
perform as or be replaced with a radiant energy reflector blocl<. a radiant energy></.>
reflector block may be sized and located the same as the flow converter 152.<br>
The radiant energy reflector block reflects radiant energy. The radiant energy<br>
reflector block may provide a turbulent flow exchange as opposed to a turbulent<br>
to laminar flow exchange. The flow converter/radiant energy reflector block may<br>
be of various sizes, shapes and conflgurations. Although not shown, the flow<br>
converter has channels similar to the channels 184, 186, in which the beiow<br>
described fasteners may attach. The grid 154 attaches to the rear surface 194 of<br>
the flow converter 152.<br>

[0058] Although the following FIGs. 8 and 9 are described prinnarily<br>
with respect to the attachment of a heating element to a PF/SCR element, the<br>
heating element may be attached to other catalyst substrates or to a flow<br>
converter using similar techniques.<br>
[0059] Referring to FIG. 8, a close-up cross-sectional side view of a<br>
portion 300 of a PF/SCR element 302 illustrating an example heating element<br>
fastener 304 is shown. A pathway section 306 of a heating element 307 is<br>
shown over a front surface 308 of the PF/SCR element 302. The heating<br>
element 307 is held onto the front surface 208 via one or more fasteners, such as<br>
the fastener 304. The fastener 304 may be integrally formed as part of the<br>
pathway section 306 and be inserted into an inlet 310 of a channel 312. The<br>
fastener 304 may be shaped or formed to allow easy assembly, but difficult<br>
disassembly. For example, the fastener 304 may be a barbed tab as shown or<br>
take on some other form. The fastener 304 may not completely plug the inlet<br>
310 and thus may allow for exhaust flow therethrough. An opening 314 is shown<br>
through which exhaust may flow. As such, the fastener 304 may wick heat into<br>
the channel 312, which further facilitates the burning of the soot therein.<br>
[0060] Referring to FIG. 9, a close-up cross-sectional side view of a<br>
portion 320 of a PF/SCR element 322 illustrating example heating element<br>
fasteners 324 is shown. A pathway section 326 of a heating element pathway of<br>
a heating element 327 is shown over a front surface 328 of the PF/SCR element<br>
322. The heating element pathway is held onto the front surface 328 via the<br>
fasteners 324, which are shown as pins. The fasteners 324 may be inserted into<br>
21<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
or attached to endpiugs 330 of outlet channels 332 of the PF/SCR element 322.<br>
The fasteners 324 may also be created and/or formed as part of the endpiugs<br>
330. The fasteners 324 may be embedded into the PF/SCR element 322, as<br>
shown, and allow for the attachment of the heating element pathway. The<br>
heating element pathway may be snapped under ends 334 of the fasteners 324.<br>
Note that the heating element pathway may be porous and allow for exhaust flow<br>
therethrough, as shown. As an alternative, the heating element pathway may be<br>
arranged on the PF, such that the inlet channel openings are positioned between<br>
pathway sections.<br>
[0061] Referring to FIG. 10, a logic flow diagram illustrating a method<br>
of performing a PF regeneration process within an exhaust system is shown.<br>
[0062] In step 400, an exhaust from an engine is passed through a flow<br>
converter, such as the flow converter 152. The flow converter converts turbulent<br>
flow of the exhaust to laminar flow prior to reception by a heating element (grid).<br>
[0063] In step 402, the exhaust after passing through the flow<br>
converter passes through or across a heating element, such as one of the<br>
heating elements (grids) 82, 154 and 231. The heating elements increase<br>
temperature of the exhaust to ignite particles within selected portions of a<br>
PF/SCR element, such as one of the PF/SCR elements 54 and 156. A selected<br>
zone or zones of the heating elements are selected and activated. The heating<br>
of a front surface of the PF/SCR element initiates regeneration without injection<br>
of fuel in the exhaust. Although fuel may be injected in the exhaust to further<br>
22<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
heat and ignite tiie particulate matter in tine PF. In one embodiment, fuel is not<br>
injected into the exhaust when performing the regeneration process.<br>
[0064] In step 404, the PF/SCR element filters particulates from the<br>
exhaust, as described above. In step 406, the PF/SCR element promotes<br>
reaction of a liquid reductant with the exhaust via a reducing catalyst included on<br>
the PF, such as by the SCR layers 215.<br>
[0065] In step 408, temperatures of the heating elements, of the<br>
exhaust, of the PF/SCR element, and/or other temperatures are determined.<br>
The temperatures may be directly or indirectly determined. When directly<br>
determined, the temperature signals may be received from sensors, such as the<br>
sensors 62. When indirectly determined, exhaust flow rate, air intake flow rate,<br>
oxygen levels, fuel injection into engine cylinders, and other parameters may be<br>
determined via a control module, such as the control module 60. These<br>
parameters may also be directly and/or indirectly determined via the sensors 62<br>
or through use of other known techniques. An algorithm may be used to<br>
determine the temperatures. Tables may be stored in memory to determine the<br>
temperatures from the stated parameters, known operating conditions, and<br>
known operating characteristics of the engine system.<br>
[0066] In step 410, the control module determines when one or more<br>
conditions exist, such as whether one or more of the temperatures has exceeded<br>
associated predetermined thresholds. When one or more of the thresholds have<br>
been exceeded, the control module may proceed to steps 412-416, otherwise the<br>
control module may continue with the regeneration process and return to step<br>
23<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No, 8540P-000554<br>
408 or proceed to step 418. When it is determined that the regeneration process<br>
is complete for a particular zone the control module proceeds to step 418. In one<br>
embodiment, when the temperature of the heating elements is equal to or greater<br>
than approximately 800-850°C, the control module proceeds to steps 412-416.<br>
[0067] In steps 412-416, the control module may adjust air intake flow<br>
rate, exhaust flow rate, fuel injector operation, heating element current, exhaust<br>
oxygen (O2) levels, and/or other operating aspects based on the determined<br>
conditions. Fuel injection operation to the engine and/or the exhaust may be<br>
adjusted. For example, the control module may perform such adjustment to<br>
reduce one or more temperatures of concern. As a more specific example, the<br>
control module may reduce temperatures of the heating elements and/or the<br>
PF/SCR element. For example, the control module may reduce current supplied<br>
to the heating elements to reduce temperature of the heating elements and thus<br>
temperature of the PF/SCR element.<br>
[0068] As an example of oxygen control, fuel and/or air injection into an<br>
engine may be adjusted to provide a richer or leaner air/fuel mixture. Post<br>
injection may also be used to adjust oxygen levels. A post injection valve or<br>
other device may be used for post injection of fuel into an engine cylinder and/or<br>
downstream therefrom. The fuel is injected after a combustion stroke in the<br>
engine cylinder and may be during an exhaust stroke thereby allowing fuel to<br>
enter the exhaust.<br>
24<br><br>
GM Reference No. P001328-PTE-CD<br>
HDP. No. 8540P-000554<br>
[0069] In step 418, the control module may select a subsequent zone<br>
to perform regeneration or end the regeneration process. Upon completion of<br>
step 418, the control module may return to step 402.<br>
[0070] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, continuously, or in a different order depending upon the<br>
application.<br>

from an engine. A particulate filter (PF) is disposed within the canister and filters<br>
particulates within an exhaust from the engine. A reducing catalyst is disposed<br>
within the canister, is on the PF, and promotes reaction of a liquid reductant in<br>
the exhaust after reception by the PF. A heating element is disposed within the<br>
canister and heats particulate matter in the PF.<br></td>
