Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a magnetic stimulation apparatus for central<br>
nervous system, a circuit thereof, use of the apparatus and method of using the apparatus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Central nervous system disease or psychiatric disease is considered as the capital<br>
killer in the 21st century since more and more people are suffering from such psychiatric<br>
disease as depression due to their growing life pace and stress. Epidemiologic survey has<br>
found that the prevalence, particularly lifetime prevalence, of schizophrenia and depression, is<br>
so high that the most heavily-suffered patients even commit suicide from time to time. After<br>
1990s, survey on the special depression-hindered group indicates a usual per thousand<br>
prevalence of 10-20, whereas statistics published by the WHO in 2001 suggests that<br>
psychiatric disease in our country be responsible for 20% of the total burden levied by<br>
handicap plus illness, which is a percentage that crests the world and is still rising, and that<br>
produces such heavy social and economic burden that it is titled the greatest disabling disease<br>
(which deprives the patients of their ability to work and to live on their own all through their<br>
life). Psychiatric disease, which includes schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive<br>
disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress<br>
disorder (PTSD), etc., belongs to a large family of chronic encephalopathy. Recently scientists<br>
include addictions to drugs, cyber-network and gambling, too, into psychiatric diseases.<br>
Among the above mentioned psychiatric diseases, the most devastating and one that levies the<br>
heaviest social and economic burden is depression, with a prevalence being 7-8% with respect<br>
to our country's total population and 20-50% to the aged population older than 60. Current<br>
treatment, apart from medical and psychological treatment, is primarily accomplished by<br>
electric stimulation or magnetic stimulation both belonging to physiotherapy, wherein the<br>
technology of magnetic stimulation, with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or<br>
repetitive TMS (rTMS) as its major development field, is now having its application scope<br>
expanded thanks to its characteristic of being analgesic, non-invasive and non-contacting<br>
compared with such side effects as pain, jerk, memory deficit(MD), etc., of the electric<br>
stimulation, as well as its other curative effects ever discovered during clinical treatment.<br>
However, it is difficult either for the current equipment to generate effective stimulation deep<br>
into the brain, or for cerebral cortex to receive ultra intensive stimulation which is converted<br>
into an effective stimulation deep into the brain due to the exponential attenuation of the<br>
magnetic induction with respect to distance. Although technology such as disclosed in CN<br>
Application No. 96180330.4 filed on April 26, 1996, etc. is expected to meet the requirement<br>
of focusing the magnetic stimulation in the deep, it is difficult to generate a magnetic field<br>
with high energy while achieving a high frequency simultaneously as rTMS at present works<br><br><br>
at a frequency of 25Hz at the most. Moreover, current magnetic stimulation apparatus<br>
frequently applied in biomedical field usually adopts one or more round shaped coils which<br>
are disposed in a plain and which, when used, is placed on the position to be stimulated and is<br>
used one-sidedly, thereby limiting the research orientation to the focusing of the magnetic<br>
stimulation and its electrophysiological sense thus introduced.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is to overcome the deficiency of the focusing magnetic<br>
stimulation by providing a magnetic stimulation apparatus for central nervous system for<br>
performing magnetic stimulation on the entire brain, as well as its use in treating nervous and<br>
psychiatric diseases and improving brain function and a methpd of controlling the magnetic<br>
stimulation apparatus.<br>
In order to achieve the above purpose, the present invention provides the following<br>
technical solution: a magnetic stimulation circuit for central nervous system, including: a<br>
control circuit, a drive power supply circuit and coils that are sequentially connected, wherein<br>
the drive power supply circuit includes a drive circuit, a detection circuit and a main circuit,<br>
both the drive circuit and the detection circuit are connected to the control circuit and the<br>
main circuit respectively, and the coils are connected to the main circuit.<br>
The main circuit may include a converting circuit for controlling currents in the<br>
coils to flow in the same or opposite direction.<br>
The main circuit may include at least one insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)<br>
and the control circuit generates a PWM signal which is used by the drive circuit to drive the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistor in the main circuit to output a time-variant current to the coils<br>
which then generate a desired time-variant magnetic field.<br>
The insulated gate bipolar transistor may be replaced by other full-controlled power<br>
semiconductor devices, and the drive circuit is subject to corresponding modifications<br>
according to technical features of the replacement devices.<br>
The control circuit may include a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip functioning<br>
as a main control chip, the drive circuit includes an optical coupler which is adapted to<br>
transfer a control signal sent from the control circuit to the main circuit, and the control<br>
circuit controls the drive circuit and the main circuit for the coils to generate a desired<br>
magnetic field, and the converting circuit may include at least one relay.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a magnetic stimulation apparatus for<br>
central nervous system, including a magnetic stimulation circuit, wherein the magnetic<br>
stimulation circuit includes a control circuit, a drive power supply circuit and coils that are<br>
sequentially connected, the drive power supply circuit includes a drive circuit, a detection<br><br><br>
circuit and a main circuit, both the drive circuit and the detection circuit are connected to the<br>

circuit.<br>
The coils include at least a coaxial, parallel, and symmetrically disposed<br>
identical coil pair, with currents in the coil pair being synchronous in time and identical in<br>
intensity and the main circuit includes a converting circuit for controlling the currents in the<br>
coil pair to flow in the same or opposite direction.<br>
The main circuit may include at least one insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)<br>
and the control circuit generates a PWM signal which is used by the drive circuit to drive the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistor in the main circuit to output a time-variant current to the coils<br>
which then generate a desired time-variant magnetic field.<br>
The insulated gate bipolar transistor may be replaced by other full-controlled power<br>
semiconductor devices, and the drive circuit is subject to corresponding modifications<br>
according to technical features of the replacement devices.<br>
The control circuit may include a DSP chip functioning as a main control chip, the<br>
drive circuit includes an optical coupler which is adapted to transfer a control signal sent from<br>
the control circuit to the main circuit, and the control circuit controls the drive circuit and the<br>
main circuit for the coils to generate a desired magnetic field, and the converting circuit may<br>
include at least one relay.<br>
Still further, the present invention provides use of a magnetic stimulation apparatus<br>
for central nervous system, which involves treating central nervous system disease or<br>
psychiatric disease or improving brain function through selecting a time-variant magnetic field<br>
having appropriate parameters to stimulate entire brain of an animal or a human being.<br>
The appropriate parameters include at least parameters of wave form, frequency and<br>
peak value intensity of current relating to the coil in the apparatus, and wave form, frequency<br>
and peak value intensity of corresponding induced magnetic field.<br>
The appropriate parameters further include intra-train frequency and inter-train<br>
frequency in the case of pulse train magnetic stimulation.<br>
Curative effect of the treatment of central nervous system disease or psychiatric<br>
disease is improved by introducing behavior guidance, thought guidance, or psychological<br>
guidance prior to, in the middle of, or after the magnetic stimulation, the specific procedure of<br>
which includes the following processes: magnetic stimulation having appropriate parameters<br>
is applied to the entire brain for an appropriate period, and in the middle of or after the<br>
magnetic stimulation, behavior guidance or thought guidance or psychological guidance is<br>
performed on those who are receiving or those who have received the magnetic stimulation.<br><br><br>
Optionally, those who are to receive magnetic stimulation are subject to behavior<br>
guidance, thought guidance, or psychological guidance prior to the magnetic stimulation,<br>
magnetic stimulation having appropriate parameters is then applied to the entire brain for an<br>
appropriate period, and after the magnetic stimulation, those who have received the magnetic<br>

Even further, the present invention provides a method of controlling a magnetic<br>

method involves electrifying coils through controlling magnetic stimulation circuit to apply a<br>
time-variant magnetic field to an objective region, wherein magnetic induction of the magnetic<br>
field has a gradient smaller than 100Gs/cm, and the objective region has a scope matching<br>
head size of an animal or a human being.<br>

controlling circuit design and outputting wave form signal to a drive power supply circuit,<br>
enables the drive power supply circuit to output current of corresponding wave form to coils,<br>
and by means of the design of the shape, number of turns, size, interval of the coils, generates<br>
within a certain region inside the coils a desired time-variant magnetic field which is then<br>
applied to the brain of an animal or a human being so that the central nervous system can<br>
receive a wide area synergy magnetic stimulation with a precise wave form, high frequency or<br>
a combination of a plurality of frequency components, thus achieving the treatment of nervous<br>
and psychiatric diseases or brain function improvement in combination with behavior<br>
guidance, thought guidance, or psychological guidance.<br><br><br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
A brief introduction of the related art is now given below for a better understanding<br>
of the technical content of the present invention:<br>
Seen from the perspective of molecular biology, neurobiology and psychiatry, a<br>
wide area synergy magnetic stimulation having a precise wave form, modulated frequency<br>
(including high frequency) and a combination of a plurality of wave form/frequency<br>
components may possess such new senses as being capable of modulating the release of<br>
neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator, modulating the receptor number and activity,<br>
activating the silent synapse, facilitating the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic<br>
transmission, potentiating the synaptic plasticity, modulating the neuroendocrine. Moreover,<br>
the synergy or causal relations of the above effects, in combination with behavior guidance,<br>
thought guidance, or psychological guidance after the magnetic stimulation, results in a<br>
progress of the cognitive ability and the learning and memory ability, improvement of mental<br>
condition, treatment of nervous and psychiatric diseases. The reason is as follows:<br>
The substance PCP that may cause schizophrenia-like symptom is found to be the<br>
excitatory amino acid receptor (NMDA receptor) antagonist, the relation of NMDAR with<br>
schizophrenia is attracting more and more attention. Kim (1980) was the first one to suggest<br>
that the dopamine (DA) release increase of schizophrenia is not primary, but may be the<br>
syndrome secondary to dysfunction of glutamatergic system. In the past 10 years, great<br>
progress has been made in the research on the NMDA receptor and transmitter function related<br><br><br>
with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, particularly the research on the relation with such<br>
deficit symptom as negative symptom, cognitive symptom, which leads to the NMDA receptor<br>
dysfunction hypothesis on schizophrenia.<br>
NMDA receptor, which is Magnesium-ion-blocked voltage-dependent excitatory<br>
amino acid transmitter gate-controlled calcium ion channel receptor, is activated under the<br>
partial depolarization condition of neuron membrane by means of cooperative effect of<br>
glutamate and glycin (usually functioning as inhibitory neurotransmitter) to result in the<br>
Calcium influx, thereby completing the entire process of depolarization of neuron and<br>
initiating successive cascade reaction. NMDA holds an important seat in the research of<br>
learning and memory cell related with molecular mechanism. In particular, LTP and the<br>
long-term depression (LTD) are considered as the inherent mechanism of synapse modification<br>
with the participation of NMDA receptor as its pre-requisite.<br>
Research by Xulin et al (see Xulin, et al. Behavioural stress facilitates the induction<br>
of long-term depression in the hippocampus. Nature(1997) 387: 497-500) indicates that stress<br>
facilitates the hippocampus' LTD, while research by Michael T. Rogan et al (see Michael T.<br>
Rogan, et al. Fear conditioning induces associative long-term potentiation in the amygdala.<br>
Nature(1997) 390: 604-607) indicates that stress leads to the facilitation of amygdala's LTP.<br>
In the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis that is the main path controlling the<br>
emotional display, hippocampus and amygdala form a negative feedback. Research by LI<br>
Shuan-de et al (see LI Shuan-de; et al. Effect of amygdala lesion on the monoamine<br>
transmitters in rat brain. Medical Journal of National Defending Forces In Northwest<br>
China(2004), 25(4):257-259) indicates that the direction of neurotransmitter change is<br>
opposite to the psychotic change after the removal of amygdala, which gives us a hint that will<br>
the amygdala's LTP and/or hippocampus' LTD lead to the psychotic change of the<br>
neurotransmitter release?<br>
Many psychiatric diseases are related more or less to such life events as stress,<br>
particularly the stressful experience during childhood or early ages, hence came out the<br>
quality-stress hypothesis. But why is the stressful experience during early or childhood ages?<br>
Suggested herein is a hypothesis that stressful experience of early ages forms an associative<br>
memory (conditioned) which is widely related with the environment, and the onset of diseases<br>
is the recall and intensification of the aversive memory. NR2A gradually replaces NR2B since<br>
the beginning of adolescence, a period associated with the general onset age of psychiatric<br>
diseases, which is not merely a coincidence. NR2B can produce stronger LTP than NR2A does<br>
and the replacement of NR2B by NR2A weakens hippocampus' LTD. If this replacement<br>
process in hippocampus and amygdala loses synchronicity or balance so that the replacement<br>
in hippocampus anticipates that in amygdala, the negative feedback inhibitory system will also<br>
lose balance, which leads to the onset of psychiatric diseases.<br><br><br>
Research by Joe Z. Tsien et al (see Tang, Y. P., et al. Genetic enhancement of<br>
learning and memory in mice. Nature(1999) 401: 63-69) indicates that NR2B may be called<br>
"smart gene" in that mice of NR2B over-expression in their research not only possess superior<br>
learning and memory ability, but also are faster in adapting to changes and exhibit better<br>
extinction of aversive memory (also referred to as re-learning ability). Recently, Giovianni<br>
Marsicano et al (see Marsicano G, et al. The endogenous cannabinoid system controls<br>
extinction of adversive memories. Nature (2002) 418 : 530-534) has found that<br>
endocannabinoid system is of key importance to the acceleration of the extinction of aversive<br>
memory, while gene mutant mice of insufficient receptor CB have much slower extinction of<br>
aversive memory than those of CB over-expression, and gene mutant mice of insufficient<br>
receptor CB with CB agonists added have their amygdala's LTP facilitated, LTD weakened or<br>
not generated. CB1 receptors, the natural ligand of which is still unknown, are of the greatest<br>
amount among the G protein-coupled receptor in brain.<br>
Neuropeptide, particularly endogenous opioid peptide (EOP), has close relationship<br>
with emotion. Jisheng HAN et al studied the relationship between the electric stimulation with<br>
different frequencies and the release of neuropeptide (see Han JS. Acupuncture and<br>
endorphins. Neurosci Lett(2004). 361 (1-3):258-61) and found out that the electric<br>
acupuncture increases the release of endogenous opioid peptide, and different frequency<br>
causes the release of different kinds of opioid peptide to increase, which means the release of<br>
neuropeptide is frequency dependent. They also found out (see Ji D, Sui., et al. NMDA<br>
receptor in nucleus accumbens is implicated in morphine withdrawal in rats. Neurochem<br>
Res(2004). 29(11):2113-20) that NMDAR agonist ketamine, if injected in nucleus accumbens,<br>
medicates the morphine withdrawal symptom. Jisheng HAN provided in 2002 (see Han<br>
Ji-Sheng. Induction of the release of central neuropeptides by peripheral electrical stimulation.<br>
J Peking Univ [ Health Sci ] (2002). 34 :408-413) a systematic description about the influence<br>
of electric stimulation to the release of neuropeptide.<br>
Earlier research carried out by many people on the influence of magnetic stimulation<br>
to the nerve regeneration indicates that the effect of magnetic stimulation on the nerve<br>
regeneration is frequency dependent (see Rusovan A, et al. The stimulatory effect of magnetic<br>
field on regeneration of the rat sciatic nerve is frequency dependent. Exp Neurol(1992).117:<br>
81-4), while static magnetic stimulation, despite its high induction, has no effect (see Cordeiro<br>
PG, et al.. Effect of a high-intensity static magnetic field on sciatic nerve regeneration in the<br>
rat. Plast Reconstr Surg(1989).83(2):301-8); that magnetic field stimulation on nerve helps to<br>
improve the activity and level of nerve growth factor (NGF) (see Longo FM, et al.<br>
Electromagnetic fields influence NGF activity and levels following sciatic nerve transection.<br>
J Neurosci Res(1999). 55(2):230-7) whereas Calcium ion antagonist, D600, prevents<br>
stimulation of nerve regeneration by magnetic fields (see Rusovan A, Kanje M. D600, a Ca2+<br><br><br>
antagonist, prevents stimulation of nerve regeneration by magnetic fields. Neuroreport(1992).<br>
Sep.3(9):813-4); and that the electrical nerve stimulation helps to release brain derived<br>
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is associated with the stimulation frequency/wave form<br>
combination and NMDA receptor, and it is the pulse wave form with high frequency and small<br>
interval (rectangular wave with a platform of 0.5ms and the frequency of 100Hz, and with 4<br>
waves in a train each separated by an interval of 200ms, adding up to 75 trains or 300 pulses),<br>
rather than the continuous lower frequency (1 Hz, 480 pulses) or higher frequency, fewer trains<br>
with wider intervals (100Hz, and with 100 waves in a train each separated by an interval of 10s,<br>
adding up to 3 or 6 trains), that helps to release BDNF, which is inhibited by NMDA agonist<br>
D-AP-5 however (see Isobel J. Lever, et ah Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Is Released in<br>
the Dorsal Horn by Distinctive Patterns of Afferent Fiber Stimulation. The Journal of<br>
Neuroscience(2001). 21(12):4469-4477). All these seem to suggest that there is a certain<br>
association among factors such as Calcium ion, NGF, BDNF, LTP (LTD), NMDA receptor,<br>
frequency of electric field and magnetic field, etc.<br>
Rohan M et al (see Rohan M, et ah Low-field magnetic stimulation in bipolar<br>
depression using an MRI-based stimulator. Am J Psychiatry(2004). 161(l):93-8) occasionally<br>
found in the clinical research of psychiatric disease that a certain sequence in MRSI enhances<br>
the mood of bipolar-depression patients with considerable statistical sense, base on which the<br>
animal experiment also confirmed the effect as an antidepressant like by this magnetic<br>
stimulation (see Carlezon WA,. et al.Antidepressant-like effects of cranial stimulation within<br>
a low-energy magnetic field in rats. Biol Psychiatry(2005). 57:571-6).<br>
We found that, in the experiment of forced swimming (a learned helpless animal<br>
model usually used for screening or verifying the effects of anti-depressant), magnetic<br>
stimulation, in combination with behavior guidance thereafter (15 minutes for the open field),<br>
significantly improves the depressive-like behavior of model animals, while only behavior<br>
guidance or pure magnetic stimulation exhibits no perceptible effect.<br>
We also found that, in fear-conditioning memory extinction experiment (after the<br>
foot shocks with acousto-optic (AO) prompt, conditioned reflex in response to the simple<br>
acousto-optic (AO) stimulation is recorded), different parameters may lead to different results,<br>
so as to strengthen or weaken the established fear conditioned reflex. Notice that certain<br>
stimulation may help to intervene the memory of negative events.<br>
The above summary and analysis give us the following two points of teaching. First,<br>
the magnetic stimulation with a precise wave form and high frequency or a combination of a<br>
plurality of frequency components may function as a safe stimulation means for the NMDA<br>
receptor, and the magnetic stimulation with high frequency may, by means of NMDAR related<br>
LTP, bring profound changes to central nervous system in multiple aspects, and affect such<br><br><br>
process as the acquisition, extraction, modification, reinforcement of the memory to improve<br>
relearning ability, so as to treat some nervous and psychiatric diseases under certain conditions<br>
(such as behavior guidance after the magnetic stimulation); this inspires us to develop a wide<br>
area synergy magnetic stimulation apparatus suitable for clinical application which can<br>
generate a precise wave form, high frequency or a combination of a plurality of<br>
frequency/waveform components and which can overcome the deficiency of rTMS and<br>
electric stimulation, thus providing a new method for the treatment and prevention of nervous<br>
and psychiatric diseases. Second, the overall research carried out on the influence of magnetic<br>
stimulation having high frequency and a combination of a plurality of wave form/frequency<br>
components to many aspects such as LTP, learning and memory, neurotransmitter, extinction<br>
of memory, neuropeptide release, synaptic plasticity, etc., may bring fundamental impact to<br>
humankind in raising intelligence, preventing psychiatric diseases and even giving up drug<br>
addiction.<br>
A detailed description of the present invention will be given with reference to the<br>
specific embodiments as follows.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the apparatus of the present invention includes a control<br>
circuit, a drive power supply circuit and coils, with the drive power supply circuit including a<br>
drive circuit, a detection circuit and a main circuit, the control circuit including an upper<br>
computer and a lower computer wherein the upper computer is a general PC or an industrial<br>
PC so as to operate in practical applications, and connects and communicates with the lower<br>
computer via RS232 interface to transmit command and parameters, and wherein the lower<br>
computer adopts a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip as the main control chip to receive the<br>
command and parameters from the upper computer, generate corresponding PWM signal<br>
which is then transferred to the drive circuit, while the drive circuit and the detection circuit<br>
are respectively connected to the lower computer and the main circuit, and the coils are<br>
connected to the main circuit, so that the control circuit generates a PWM signal, and the drive<br>
circuit drives the main circuit in which the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) outputs a<br>
time variant current to stimulate the coil pair and to stimulate and generate a time variant<br>
magnetic field. Meanwhile, the detection circuit samples the voltage and current values in the<br>
main circuit, monitors the work status of the main circuit in real time, and adjusts the output<br>
PWM signal if necessary, or cuts the coil circuit immediately in case of over current to prevent<br>
the damage of coil.<br>
The drive circuit including an optical coupler is connected between the lower<br>
computer and the main circuit and primarily functions to shield the interference signal and<br>
drive the main circuit. (The above described part of circuit is not shown in the drawings.)<br>
The main circuit, as shown in Figure 3, includes a rectifier bridge BR1, five IGBTs<br><br><br>
Q1-Q5, and two electrolytic capacitors C2 and C3 with the electrolytic capacitors C2 and C3<br>
being connected in parallel to the output terminals of the rectifier bridge BR1. The IGBT Q1,<br>
with its trigger terminal being connected to one pulse width modulation (PWM) terminal<br>
PWM1 of the drive circuit, is connected between the negative terminal of electrolytic<br>
capacitor C2 and the rectifier bridge BR1. The IGBTs Q4 and Q5, with their two trigger<br>
terminals connected to the other two PWM1 terminals of the drive circuit (the 3 PWM1<br>
terminals are independent), are connected in series between the negative terminal of<br>
electrolytic capacitor C3 and the rectifier bridge BR1. The capacitors C2 and C3 are also<br>
connected in parallel to the terminals of the other two IGBTs Q2 and Q3, with the IGBTs Q2<br>
and Q3 having their trigger terminals respectively connected to the other two PWM terminals<br>
PWM2 and PWM3 of the drive circuit. The coil L2 is connected between the emitter of the<br>
IGBT Q2 and the collector of the IGBT Q3. The converting circuit includes a relay DPDT K1<br>
with the relay Kl having its two common (input) terminals connected in parallel with both<br>
terminals of the coil L2, and its normally open terminal on one path connected to its normally<br>
closed terminal on the other path and its normally open terminal on the other path connected to<br>
its normally closed terminal on the former one path. Thus, four output terminals become two<br>
output terminals. The coil L3 is connected to the two output terminals and the coil of the relay<br>
Kl is connected to the two controlling terminals of the lower computer. The IGBTs may be<br>
discrete IGBT elements or an integrated IGBT module. The function of the optical coupler in<br>
the drive circuit may also be achieved by the IGBT module integrated with driving function.<br>
The detection circuit adopts an LEM voltage sensor and a current sensor to detect<br>
the voltage between both terminals of capacitors C2 and C3 and the currents flowing through<br>
two coils L2 and L3, and applies filtering, amplification and A/D conversion to the detected<br>
signals, which are then transferred to the lower computer. (The above described part of circuit<br>
is not shown in the drawings.)<br>
The coils are a coaxial, parallel, and symmetrically disposed identical coil pair, the<br>
structure of which is shown in Figure 2 with the radius supposed as R and the distance being<br>
2a=√3R to constitute a Maxwell coil pair and to generate a linear gradient magnetic field<br>
within the objective region between the two coils when the currents supplied flow in opposite<br>
direction but an approximately uniform magnetic field within the objective region when the<br>
currents supplied flow in the same direction. The objective region has a scope matching the<br>
head size of a human being. When the coils are supplied with the currents flowing in opposite<br>
direction, a linear gradient magnetic field is generated within a spherical region with its origin<br>
located at point O and its radius being 0.5a, into which the human head is located as much as<br>
possible. Additionally, the radius and the number of turns of the coil should be minimized as<br>
much as possible, so that the hardware of the drive power supply circuit can be less<br>
complicated and less power consumptive, which is easier to implement and makes the coil<br><br><br>
produce less heat to adapt to the high frequency current that generates high frequency<br>
magnetic field. An approximately uniform magnetic field can be obtained and the ergonomics<br>
requirement can be met by giving up a little linearity of the magnetic field gradient when<br>
setting R=180mm, which is therefore applied in a preferred embodiment. In this case, if the<br>
coil is made to have 40 turns and the peak value of current in each turn is set to 5A, then a<br>
magnetic field gradient of 0.5Gs/cm can be obtained in the central region. In practical<br>
application that sets the coil to have 40 turns and the peak value of current in each turn to be<br>
40A, a magnetic field gradient may be up to 4Gs/cm so as to achieve a satisfying curative<br>
effect. Besides, the lower computer may control the relay K1 to convert the coil L3 from its<br>
original connecting direction into a reverse direction so as to alter the direction of the coil<br>
current and switch the coil currents into a flowing in the same direction, thus generating even<br>
greater magnetic induction in the central region and improving the uniformity of magnetic<br>
field while reducing its gradient, which, in practical application, can lead to an effect which is<br>
different from that of the currents flowing in opposite direction.<br>
While in operation, the user configures each parameter for system running by means<br>
of the upper computer and the parameter is transmitted to the lower computer via serial port.<br>
The lower computer, when receiving operating command, sends the PWM signal in the first<br>
place to control the Q1 and Q4 of the main circuit so that voltages on capacitors C2 and C3<br>
reach the calculated desired values, and the voltages on capacitors C2 and C3 are acquired by<br>
the A/D converter of the lower computer via the detection circuit. When the voltages on<br>
capacitors C2 and C3 reach the desired values, the lower computer controls the on/off of Q2,<br>
Q3 by sending different PWM signals to them so as to generate various current wave forms,<br>
thus generating various corresponding time-variant magnetic fields. The main circuit control<br>
is divided into three phases, which are the rising phase, maintaining phase and dropping phase<br>
of the current. The rising phase of the current comes first, during which Q2, Q3 are both turned<br>
on and L2, L3 are subject to constant voltage (which is equal to the voltage on C2) so that their<br>
currents rise linearly with the slope that may be varied by changing the voltage on C2, and the<br>
maximum current in the coil may be varied by changing the time of this phase. Next comes the<br>
maintaining phase, during which Q3 is still on but Q2 switches on and off intermittently so as<br>
to maintain the current in L2, L3 in a substantially stable level. The final phase is the dropping<br>
phase, during which Q2, Q3 are both turned off, and the currents in L2, L3 have no choice but<br>
recharge the capacitor C3 via D2 and D3, which means that the coils L2, L3 have both of their<br>
terminals applied a reverse voltage equal to the voltage on C3, and the currents in the coils L2,<br>
L3 drop linearly until the values reduce to zero, with the slope that may be varied by changing<br>
the voltage on C3. After this dropping phase followed by a zero current interval, a new rising<br>
phase starts again, thus generating a cyclic time-variant current with a fixed period and precise<br>
wave form, and generating a periodical time-variant magnetic field with precise wave form.<br><br><br>
When engaged in working, the control circuit is configured and controlled to<br>
generate the isosceles trapezium wave as shown in Figure 4, which is then applied to the coil<br>
pair to generate the corresponding time-variant magnetic field and to induce, along the rising<br>
edge and falling edge of the isosceles trapezium wave, an electric field with positive and<br>
negative rectangular pulse waves within the objective region, thus meeting the medical<br>
requirement. In an example where a rising edge of 128µs is succeeded by a platform of 768µs,<br>
a falling edge of 128µs and a zero-current platform of 768µs which adds up to 1792µs as the<br>
period (high frequency), the currents flow in opposite direction in the coil pair, and the peak<br>
value of current per turn is 20A (corresponding to a magnetic field gradient of 2Gs/cm). It is<br>
also possible to implement a combination of a plurality of wave forms and frequency<br>
components and, by designing the number of periods for outputting and terminating the wave<br>
form, to constitute a train of magnetic stimulation which includes such parameters as the<br>
intra-train frequency and the inter-train frequency. For example, the above wave form is output<br>
for 10 periods then terminated for 27 periods, which constitute a train period, so that the pulses<br>
of the induced electric field have an intra-train frequency of 558Hz approximately (or 1116Hz<br>
approximately if ignoring the direction of the electric field) and an inter-train frequency of<br>
15Hz approximately (β rhythm); or. the same wave form may be terminated for 90 periods<br>
after being stimulated for 20 consecutive periods and have an inter-train frequency of 5Hz (θ<br>
rhythm). By means of the upper computer, users may set different magnetic stimulation<br>
parameters in accordance with medical requirements. As the application for treating nervous<br>
or psychiatric diseases or improving brain function, the above magnetic stimulation may be<br>
applied to the whole brain of anyone in need of it (such as patients with depression) and kept<br>
continuously for a suitable period. As to continuous magnetic stimulation, an uninterrupted<br>
stimulation should not last too long each time to avoid the over activation of NMDA receptor<br>
and the possible side effect thus introduced, whereas trains of magnetic stimulation may last<br>
longer, such as 20 minutes. Trains of magnetic stimulation may be outputted intermittently<br>
such as for 2 seconds, for example, in every 10 seconds and be terminated in the other 8<br>
seconds, thus being applied periodically. For those who are receiving or have received the<br>
magnetic stimulation, a behavior guidance, thought guidance, or psychological guidance is<br>
carried out to complete the entire process of the treatment or brain function improvement. For<br>
example, those who received the magnetic stimulation may experience or enter a novel<br>
environment, or they may be inspired to think through intelligence games or problem solving,<br>
wherein the problems may be embodied as a standard library and belong to the category of<br>
social science or natural science or knowledge of daily life. Combinations of the problems<br>
may be chosen in accordance with the educational background and intelligence quotient of<br>
patients, and be solved by those who received the magnetic stimulation. Alternatively, they<br>
may experience benign stimulation by means of specific music or image, or may keep their<br>
brains in a benign excitement by means of psychological assistance. The behavior guidance,<br><br><br>
thought guidance, and psychological guidance have such important feature as to give the<br>
patients more or less puzzle while enabling them to solve successfully.<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram of the distribution of magnetic lines of force in the magnetic<br>
field (only half is shown) which is generated through electrifying the coils with the currents<br>
flowing in opposite direction. As can be seen from the diagram, the magnetic lines of force<br>
within the objective region have linear gradient distribution, with 501 being the coils, 502<br>
magnetic lines of force, and the region within 503 the objective region into which the human<br>
head is put during the process of treatment.<br>
Figure 6 is a diagram of the distribution of magnetic lines of force in the magnetic<br>
field that is generated through electrifying the coils with the currents flowing in the same<br>
direction. As can be seen from the diagram, the magnetic lines of force within the objective<br>
region have approximately uniform distribution, with 601 being the coils, 602 magnetic lines<br>
of ferce and 603 the objective region into which the human head is put during the process of<br>
treatment.<br>
In another embodiment 2 of the present invention which has a configuration<br>
identical to that of embodiment I, combination of another two wave forms is generated<br>
through setting and controlling the control circuit, so that the coil pair generates corresponding<br>
magnetic field, as shown in Figure 7 where wave A is a continuous sawtooth wave which has a<br>
frequency of 1000Hz and lasts 3 minutes while wave B is an intermittent triangular wave<br>
which has a frequency of 2Hz and lasts 3 minutes. These two waves occur by alternation for 3<br>
cycles and last 18 minutes altogether to constitute a magnetic stimulation session, after which<br>
the above behavior guidance, thought guidance, or psychological guidance is carried out to<br>
complete the treatment of nervous and psychiatric diseases or brain function improvement.<br>
As the use for treating nervous or psychiatric diseases or improving brain function,<br>
the method of using the apparatus may also include carrying out behavior guidance, thought<br>
guidance, or psychological guidance before the magnetic stimulation, wherein such guidance<br>
before the magnetic stimulation, which may differ from that after the magnetic stimulation, is<br>
aimed at extracting by means of the guidance the negative memory stored in the brain and<br>
exhibiting the same, whereas guidance after the magnetic stimulation is to modify, by means<br>
of "successful stress resistance", the negative memory and to reconstruct the negative<br>
feedback path of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, or improve the<br>
antistress ability.<br>
Apart from the above two preferred embodiments, the present invention may also<br>
adopt a coil with oval, rectangular shape or coil with other appropriate shapes including cubic<br>
shape, or the present invention may vary such coil parameters as the interval, number of turns,<br>
etc., or may alternatively adopt the combination of two or more coil pairs, or a coil with larger<br><br><br>
size, or a solenoid. The present invention may also, through controlling the control circuit and<br>
the drive circuit, achieve the combination of more wave forms, frequencies and amplitudes to<br>
complete a magnetic stimulation session. More wave forms of current including, for example,<br>
isosceles trapezium, may induce a magnetic field wave form including scalene trapezium,<br>
isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, etc. The output current may have a frequency lower than<br>
1000Hz. A magnetic stimulation session may be completed by the combination of a plurality<br>
of wave forms and a plurality of frequency components, or it is also possible to apply the<br>
currents flowing in opposite direction in case of high frequency, and currents flowing in the<br>
same direction in case of low frequency. Furthermore, the IGBTs in the main circuit may be<br>
replaced by other full-controlled power semiconductor devices, such as the GRT, or power<br>
MOSFET or GTO, etc., and the main circuit is modified accordingly to adapt to the technical<br>
features of these devices, thus achieving the function of the main circuit. It is also possible to<br>
add into the main circuit two more IGBTs or other power semiconductor devices, as well as<br>
corresponding drive circuit and control circuit, so as to enable the currents in the coils to flow<br>
in both directions.<br>
