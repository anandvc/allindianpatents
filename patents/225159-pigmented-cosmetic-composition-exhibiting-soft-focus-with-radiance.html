HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>

-	PIGMENTED COSMETIC COMPOSITION EXHIBITING RADIANCE WITH SOFT FOCUS<br>
The invention relates to compositions for improving the appearance of skin, particularly to provide good coverage over imperfections <br>
5   such as pores and uneven skin tone, while retaining a natural skin, appearance.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
   A matte effect is desired for users of color cosmetics.  The matte finish overcomes the shiny effect engendered by greasy skin, <br>
10   particularly under hot and humid conditions. Absorbent fillers such as talc, silica, kaolin and other inorganic particulates have been used to achieve the effect by their optical properties.<br>
  Imperfect skin can be hidden in two ways through manipulation off light transmission. In the first, components of the color cosmetic: <br>
15  may simply reflect light back toward the source. An alternative approach is referred to as achieving a soft focus effect. Here the incoming light is distorted by scattering (lensing). Components of the color cosmetic in this mechanism operate as lenses to bend and twist light into a variety of directions.<br>
20   While it is desirable to hide imperfect skin through a matte effect, there is also a desire to achieve a healthy skin radiance-  A cosmetic covering that is too opaque hides the skin under a paint-like coating.  Imperfections are hidden but there is no radiance -Where light transmission is insufficiently hindered, the opposite<br>
25  occurs.  Here the glow may be healthy but aesthetically displeasing skin topography and color may now be apparent.<br><br>

US Patent 5,997,890 (Sine et al.), US Patent 5,972,359 (Sine et al.), and US Patent 6,174,533 Bl (SaNogueira, Jr.) are all directed to topical compositions to provide good coverage of skin imperfections. The solution proposed by these documents is the use <br>
5   of a metal oxide with a refractive index of at least about 2 and a neat primary particle size of from about 100 to about 300 nm. Preferred particulates are titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
Silicone gelling agents such as crosslinked organopolysiloxane <br>
10 elastomers because of their excellent skinfeel properties have been found useful in make-up compositions. For instance, US Patent 5,266,321 (Shukuzaki et al.) discloses an oily make-up composition comprised of a silicone gel crosslinked elastomer, titanium dioxide, mica and iron oxides. Japanese patent application 61-194009 <br>
15 (Harashima) describes a make-up composition comprising a cured organopolysiloxane elastomer powder and pigments which may be selected from talc, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and iron oxides.<br>
A challenge which has not been fully met by the known art is delivery of a composition with appropriate optics to achieve both <br>
20   soft focus and radiance properties in a system that still provides excellent skinfeel.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
A cosmetic composition is provided which includes: <br>
  (i)   a crosslinked silicone elastomer; .<br>
  (ii)  a zinc oxide of average particle size less than 300 nm; <br>
5    (iii) a light reflecting inorganic material of platelet shaped particles having an average particle size of about 10,000 to about 30,000 nm; and <br>
     (iv)  a cosmetically acceptable carrier system.<br>
10    Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
     Now it has been observed that a soft focus effect with radiance can be obtained by a combination of fine particle sized zinc oxide or zirconium oxide suspended with a crosslinked silicone elastomer. The zinc or zirconium oxide must have an average <br>
15  particle size less than 300 nm. Absent the elastomer or the zinc or zirconium oxide, there would be insufficient soft focus effect. The oxide alone is inefficient because of excessive loss of reflectance/radiance.<br>
Crosslinked Silicone Elastomer<br>
20  A component of the present invention is a crosslinked silicone<br>
(organopolysiloxane) elastomer.  No specific restriction exists<br>
   as to the type of curable organopolysiloxane composition that<br>
can serve as starting material for the crosslinked silicone<br>
elastomer.  Examples in this respect are addition reaction-<br>
25 curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure under platinum metal catalysis by the addition reaction between SiH-containing<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/011363<br><br>

diorganopolysiloxane and organopolysiloxane having silicon-bonded vinyl groups; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound by a dehydrogenation reaction between hydroxyl terminated <br>
 5 diorganopolysiloxane and SiH-containing ' diorganopolysiloxane; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound or a titanate ester, by a condensation reaction between an hydroxyl terminated diorganopolysiloxane  and  a  hydrolyzable  organosilane  (this<br>
10 condensation reaction is exemplified by dehydration, alcohol-liberating, oxime-liberating, amine-liberating, amide-liberating, carboxyl-liberating, and ketone-liberating reactions); peroxide-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which thermally cure in the presence of an organoperoxide<br>
15  catalyst; and organopolysiloxane compositions which are cured by high-energy radiation, such as by gamma-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or electron beams.<br>
    Addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane  compositions  are preferred for their rapid curing rates and excellent uniformity <br>
20  of curing.  A particularly preferred addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane composition is prepared from:<br>
(A)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 lower alkenyl<br>
groups in each molecule;<br>
(B)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded <br>
(C)	25       hydrogen atoms in each molecule; and<br>
(D)	a platinum-type catalyst.<br>
The crosslinked siloxane elastomer of the present invention may either  be  an  emulsifying  or  non-emulsifying  crosslinked<br><br>
WO 2005/070382<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011363<br><br>

organopolysiloxane elastomer or combinations thereof. The term "non-emulsifying," as used herein, defines crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer from which polyoxyalkylene units are absent. The term "emulsifying," as used herein, means <br>
5 crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer having at least one polyoxyalkylene (e.g., polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene) unit.<br>
Particularly useful emulsifying elastomers are polyoxyalkylene-modified elastomers formed from divinyl compounds, particularly <br>
10 siloxane polymers with at least two free vinyl groups, reacting with Si-H linkages on a polysiloxane backbone. Preferably, the elastomers are dimethyl polysiloxanes crosslinked by Si-H sites on a molecularly spherical MQ resin.<br>
Preferred silicone elastomers are organopolysiloxane <br>
15 compositions available under the INCI names of dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer and Polysilicone-ll. Ordinarily these materials are provided as a 1-30% crosslinked silicone elastomer dissolved or suspended in a dimethicone fluid (usually cyclomethicone) . For purposes of <br>
20 definition "crosslinked silicone elastomer" refers to the elastomer alone rather than the total commercial compositions which also include a solvent (e.g. dimethicone) carrier.<br>
Dimethicone/vinyl  dimethicone  crosspolymers  and  dimethicone<br>
crosspolymers  are  available  from  a  variety  of  suppliers<br><br>
25  including Dow Corning (9040, 9041, 9045, 9506 and 9509), General<br>
Electric    (SFE   839),   Shin   Etsu   (KSG-15,    16,    18<br>
[dimethicone/phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer] ), and Grant<br><br>
WO 2005/070382<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011363<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Industries (Gransil™ line of materials) , and lauryl dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers supplied by Shin Etsu (e.g., KSG-31, KSG-32, KSG-41, KSG-42, KSG-43, and KSG-44).<br>
   Other suitable commercially available silicone elastomer powders <br>
5  include vinyl dimethicone/methicone silesquioxane crosspolymers from Shin-Etsu sold as KSP-100, KSP-101, KSP-102, KSP-103, KSP-104, KSP-105, and hybrid silicone powders that contain a fluoroalkyl group or a phenyl group sold by Shin-Etsu as respectively KSP-200 and KSP-300.<br>
10  The crosslinked silicone elastomers of the present invention may range in concentration from about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10%, optimally from about 0.5 to about 2% by weight of the cosmetic composition. These weight values exclude any solvent such as cyclomethicone found in commercial<br>
15  "elastomer" silicones such as the Dow Corning products 9040 and 9045. For instance, the amount of crosslinked silicone elastomer in 9040 and 9045 is between 12 and 13% by weight.<br>
    Most preferred as the silicone elastomer is 9045 which has a D5 cyclomethicone swelled elastomer particle size (based on volume <br>
20  and calculated as spherical particles) which averages about 38 micron, and may range from about 25 to about 55 micron.<br>
Micronized Zinc or Zirconium Oxide<br>
A second important component of the present invention is that of<br>
	a micronized zinc oxide or zirconium oxide having average<br>
25  (number) particle sizes less than 300 nm, preferably less than<br>
200 nm, more preferably less than 100 nm and optimally less than<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/011363<br><br>

85 nm. Generally the particle sizes can range from about 0.01 to about 280 nm, more preferably from about 1 to about 200 nm, even more preferably from 10 to 95 nm, and optimally from 25 to 75 nm.<br>
5  Average particle size of the oxide assumes a spherical shape and is defined as the diameter of the particle averaged over many particles. The average value is a number average. For spherical particles such as the zinc oxide, laser light scattering is utilized to determine the individual sizes of the<br>
10  particles and generate a particle size distribution plot. Based upon the distribution plot, the average particle size can be determined. In more mathematical terms, the average particle size is a diameter converted from the meso-pore specific surface area determined by the t-plot method (particle size converted<br>
15  excluding the specific surface area of micro pores of less than 20 Angstrom). In detail, the average particle size D, assuming the particle as spherical form, can be obtained by the following equation.- D=6/pS, where S (m2/g) represents a meso-pore specific surface area and p(g/cm3) is the density.<br>
20  The amount of zinc oxide or zirconium oxide may range from about 0.1 to about 20%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10%, optimally from about 1 to about 5% by weight of the cosmetic composition.<br>
Since zinc or zirconium oxide particles are applied to skin, it<br>
25  is  desirable  that  they  be  free  of  toxic  trace  metal<br>
contaminants.  A particularly preferred zinc oxide has trace<br>
concentrations of lead (less than 20 ppm) , arsenic (less than 3<br><br>

ppm), cadmium (less than 15 ppm) and mercury (less than 1 ppm). This material is commercially available from BASF Corporation under the trademark of Z-Cote HP1. These particles are best delivered to the formula as a pre-mix of 5-80% weight by weight <br>
5   suspended in an organic ester base.<br>
Zinc oxide or zirconium oxide particles of the present invention advantageously but not necessarily are substantially spherical in shape. The refractive index of these particles may preferably range from about 1.8 to about 2.3. Measurement of <br>
10  refractive index can be performed according to a method described in J.A. Dean, Ed., Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 14th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York 1992, Section 9, Refractometry, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Light Reflecting Platelet Particles<br>
15 A third important component of compositions according to the present invention is that of light reflecting platelet shaped particles. These particles will have an average particle size D5o ranging from about 10,000 to about 30,000 nm. For platelike materials the average particle size is a number average<br>
20  value. The platelets are assumed to have a circular shape with the diameter of the circular surface averaged over many particles. The thickness of the plate-like particles is considered to be a separate parameter. For instance, the platelets can have an average particle size of 35,000 nm and an<br>
25  average thickness of 400 nm. For purposes herein, thickness is considered to range from about 100 to about 600 nm. Laser light scattering can be utilized for measurement except that light<br><br>

PCT7EP2004/011363<br><br>

scattered data has to be mathematically corrected from the spherical to the non-spherical shape. Optical and electron microscopy may be used to determine average particle size. Thickness is normally only determined via optical or electron <br>
5  microscopy.<br>
The refractive index of these particles is preferred to be at least about 1.8, generally from about 1.9 to about 4, more preferably from about 2 to about 3, optimally between about 2.5 and 2.8.<br>
10  Illustrative but not limiting examples of light reflecting particles are bismuth oxychloride (single crystal platelets) and titanium dioxide coated mica.

a draggy feel which many consumers dislike. Normal force is measured in the following manner. A rheometer that has a shear rate mode capability and a normal force transducer is utilized to measure the high shear normal force. These devices are available from <br>
5  Rheometric Scientific ARES, TA Instruments AR2000, and Paar Physica MCR. Samples are compressed between concentric parallel plates of diameter 25 mm and gap (vertical distance between the two plates) of 100 microns. The measurements are made in a continuous logarithmic shear sweep mode with a shear rate range of 1 to 10,000 s"1.  Each<br>
10 sweep takes 5 minutes and is conducted at ambient condition (20-25°C). The normal force is calculated by subtracting the baseline (defined as the normal force value at or near 100 s"1) from the highest normal force value measured between 1000 and 10,000 s'1. A positive normal force of 5 grams and especially 10 grams or greater<br>
15  is correlated to products/materials with silky sensations during rubbing in application.<br>
The higher the positive value of the normal force the better is the soft focus effect. .Ordinarily, soft focus is enhanced when the normal force ranges from about +5 to about +100 grams. Particularly <br>
20  desirable is a positive normal force in the range from about +10 to about +60, optimally from about +25 to about +40 grams.<br>

- 28 -Optical Measurements<br>
Opacity is the measure of intensity attenuation of a transmitted light beam shone perpendicular to a medium or film. The higher the direct beam attenuation, the greater will be the opacity. <br>
5   The source of the light beam attenuation is two fold: A) Some of the original light is reflected back from the film/medium. This gives the film/medium a true white/opaque appearance with great hiding power. Using pigment-grade Ti02 in a formulation will give the effect. B) Some of the light is deflected from the <br>
10  straight beam path but still transmitted through the film/medium. In effect, the film/medium goes from being transparent to translucent, creating a "blurred" image. Another term for this is soft focus.<br>
Procedure: Apply (or draw down) a 3 mil (76.2 um) film of a <br>
15 formulation using a draw down bar on to a plastic overhead transparency sheet. Let the film dry for 2 hours at room temperature. Take the coated overhead transparency and place it in an Instrument Systems goniospectrophotometer. Set the light source and detector arrayed in a straight line perpendicular to <br>
20   the coated transparency. The light source (set at 209 million Watt-nm/cm2, which serves as a reference for all Transmission Intensity values reported herein) is turned on and the measurement of the transmitted light intensity is made. Further measurements are made by moving the detector 10, 30, 40, 50 <br>
25 degrees away from the direct transmission normal. These values indicate the extent of soft focus light scattering. The Reflectance or "radiance" of a product is determined in the same way as opacity/soft focus light scattering,  except for the<br><br>
WO 2005/070382<br><br>

positions of the light source and detector. The detector is 30 degrees on one side of the normal/perpendicular, while the light source is 20 degrees on the other side. To determine the extent of the intensity attenuation, compare the intensity value to <br>
5   that of an uncoated overhead transparency. The difference between these two values is the extent of the attenuation or opacity.<br>
Results:   The effect of certain components on	the optical<br>
properties  of  the  compositions  was  evaluated	by  testing<br>
10  formulations with those components removed.	Results are<br>
reported in Table II.<br><br>

Sample 1 is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Transmission Intensity (Opacity) at all angles and Reflection Intensity for this formula fell within the parameters necessary to achieve both soft focus and radiance. Replacement of the <br>
5   silicone elastomer (Dow Corning 9045) with cyclopentasiloxane (Dow Coming 245) in Sample 2 resulted in a Transmission Intensity at four angles outside the acceptability ranges. In Sample 3 the zinc oxide was omitted. Here the Transmission Intensity was also outside four of the acceptable ranges<br>
10  indicating the necessity of zinc oxide to achieve soft focus. Removal of Ganzpearl® GMP-0820, which consists of polymethylmethacrylate beads, in Sample 4 had only a small affect on the opacity. Sample 5 wherein Satin Mica was removed as expected demonstrated greater light transmission, but the<br>
15  Reflection Intensity and the 0° angle Transmission Intensity were outside the acceptable range. Removal of Timiron® MP 111 (titanium dioxide coated mica) in Sample 6 demonstrated that this component was a very significant contributor to the soft focus/radiance effect.   In Samples 7 and 8 the amount of<br>
20  Aristoflex AVC® (taurate copolymer) was reduced. The 0° angle and 30° angle Transmission Intensity values were the only ones outside the acceptable range indicating that this copolymer had an influence and contributed to the soft focus effect.<br>
Example 2<br>
25  In this Example we investigated the effect of zinc oxide in contrast to titanium dioxide of essentially similar average particle sizes. The Formulas investigated are given in Table III . Results are reported in Table IV.<br><br>
