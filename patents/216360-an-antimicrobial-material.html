				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to non-leaching antimicrobial materials, specifically, the<br>
provision of antimicrobial materials capable of killing microorganisms on contact, as well as<br>
methods of manufacture and use of such materials.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The constant threat of bacterial contamination and the associated repercussions on health<br>
have made preservatives a ubiquitous part of drugs and packaged food. However, preservatives<br>
oftentimes have undesirable side effects, especially in pharmaceutical products. Growing<br>
consumer awareness about the deleterious effect of preservatives in recent years has necessitated<br>
their reduction or preferably, total elimination, without risking bacterial contamination, thus<br>
prompting the need for the development of new, cost effective packaging and storing methods<br>
that prevent bacterial contamination. The problem is acute in the pharmaceutical area, especially<br>
in the ophthalmic industry, which is presently driven by the need to address the issue of patient<br>
sensitivity toward preservatives in ocular solutions. Burnstein, N.L. et al., Trans. Ophthalmol.<br>
Soc., 104: H02 (1985); Collins. H.B. et at. Am. J. Optom. &amp; Physiolog. Optics. 51: 215 (A89).<br>
Similar problem, exist in the food, medical device, healthcare and water purification areas.<br>
The modality of action of all infection resistant surfaces presently known is via one of the<br>
following mechanisms: (i) dissolution of an antimicrobial component into the contacting solution,<br>
or (ii) chemically bound antimicrobials. The former is accomplished by blending an antimicrobial<br>
compound with a plastic material. The composite material is then either molded into a device or<br>
applied as a coating. The bactericidal action of such coatings depend on diffusion of the biotoxic<br>
agent into solution. Numerous examples of this type have been reported in the literature.<br>
Another variant of this type involves hydrolysis or dissolution of the matrix containing an<br>
antimicrobial compound, thereby effecting it"s release into solution. High levels of preservatives<br>
are, however, released into contacting solutions in long term applications. In the latter<br>
mechanism, a bioactive compound is covalently bound either directly to the substrate surface or a<br>
polymeric material that forms a nondissolving surface coating; The antimicrobial compounds in<br>
such coatings exhibit greatly diminished activity, unless assisted by hydrolytic breakdown of either<br>
the bound antimicrobial or the coating itself. In either case, relatively high levels of preservative<br>
has to be released into solution in order to elicit antimicrobial action.<br>
Various products for use externally or internally with humans or animals can serve to<br>
introduce bacterial, viral, fungal or other undesirable infections. Such products include medical<br>
devices, surgical gloves and implements, catheters, implants and other medical implements. To<br>
prevent such contamination, such devices can be treated with an antimicrobial agent. Known<br>
methods of preparing an infection-resistant medical devices have been proposed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
3,566,874; 3,674,901; 3,695,921; 3,705,938; 3,987,797; 4,024,871; 4,318,947; 4,381,380;<br>
4,539,234; 4,612,337; 3,699,956; 4,054,139; 4,592,920; 4,603,152; 4,667,143 and 5,019,096.<br>
However, such methods are complicated and unsatisfactory. Prior known antimicrobial coatings<br>
often leach material into the surrounding environment Many are specifically designed for<br>
releasing antimicrobial agents (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,096). There is a need for medical devices<br>
and other products which are able to resist microbial infection when used in the area of the body<br>
to which they are applied, which provide this resistance over the period of time, and which do not<br>
leach antimicrobial materials into the environment<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide contact killing non-leaching antimicrobial<br>
materials which are capable of killing microorganisms on contact, but which do not leach<br>
significant amounts of antimicrobial materials into the surrounding environment. The<br>
antimicrobial materials may be deposited on the surface of a substrate to form a contact-killing<br>
antimicrobial coating on the surface, may be compounded with a polymer and cast into a<br>
freestanding antimicrobial object or film, or may be incorporated into a carrier to provide a bulk<br>
antimicrobial which can be applied as desired to form a contact-killing antimicrobial layer.<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention are molecularly designed to enable a<br>
completed or matrix bound biocide to retain high activity without elution of any biocide into<br>
contacting solutions, carriers or other materials. The antimicrobial"s activity stems from the<br>
sustained, cooperative biocidal action of its components. Selective transfer of one component<br>
from within the matrix directly to the microorganism upon contact is achieved via a "hand off"<br>
mechanism upon engagement and penetration of the microorganism"s cell membrane. The<br>
antimicrobial material, therefore, maintains long term efficacy without releasing toxic elutables<br>
into the surrounding environment.<br>
The antimicrobial material of the present invention comprises a combination of an organic<br>
material which is capable of forming a matrix, and a broad spectrum biocide omplexed with or<br>
associated with the organic material. The biocide interacts sufficiently strongly with the organic<br>
material that the biocide does not leach or readily dissociate from the organic material The<br>
organic material must possess two important properties: it must be capable of reversibly binding<br>
or complexing with the biocide, and must be capable of insinuating the biocide into the cell<br>
membrane of a microorganism which contacts it. The organic material preferably is substantially<br>
water-insoluble, and capable of dissolving into or adhering to the cell membrane surrounding the<br>
microorganism. Preferred organic materials are those which can be immobilized on a surface or<br>
incorporated into a carrier and which bind the biocide in such a manner as to preferentially release<br>
the biocide into a microorganism which contacts the material, but not into the surrounding<br>
environment. The biocide preferably is a tow molecular weight metallic material that is toxic to<br>
microorganisms and is capable of complexing with or reversibly binding to the organic matrix<br>
material, but which binds preferentially to cellular proteins of microorganisms. When a<br>
microorganism contacts the antimicrobial material, the organic material engages or penetrates at<br>
least the outer portion of the lipid bilayer of the microorganism"s cell membrane sufficiently to<br>
permit insinuation of the biocide into the microorganism, where cell proteins or proteins in the<br>
lipid bilayer compete effectively for the biocide due to favorable binding constants. The result is a<br>
contact-killing delivery system that selectively transfers the biocide through or into the<br>
microorganism"s cell membrane upon contact without elution of the biocide into solution, thereby<br>
maintaining long term efficacy. The unique mode of action of the presently described<br>
antimicrobial material offers high activity coupled with substantially low leachables.<br>
Organic materials useful in the present invention comprise materials which are capable of:<br>
1.) reversibly binding or complexing with a biocide, and 2.) insinuating the biocide into the cell<br>
membrane of the microorganism upon contact. A preferred class of materials are those having<br>
the aforementioned properties, and which are capable of complexing and/or binding an<br>
antimicrobial metallic material. Most preferred is the class of organic materials which can dissolve<br>
into, or adhere to, and penetrate at least the outer portion of the lipid bilayer membrane of a<br>
microorganism. For this purpose, surface active agents, such as cationic compounds, polycationic<br>
compounds, anionic compounds, polyanionic compounds, non-ionic compounds, polynonionic<br>
compounds or zwitterionic compounds are useful. Organic materials which currently are most<br>
preferred for use in the invention include cationic or polycationic materials such as biguanide<br>
compounds. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the organic material is a<br>
polymer capable of forming a matrix. It is understood that the term "polymer" as used herein<br>
includes any organic material comprising three or more repeating units, and includes oligomers,<br>
polymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc.<br>
In one aspect, the organic material can be an adduct formed by reaction of the organic<br>
material with a crosslinking agent or a chain-extending agent. Crosslinking agents which can be<br>
used in the present invention are those multifunctional organic compounds which react with the<br>
organic material to form an adduct which can be crosslinked to form a crosslinked network or<br>
matrix. Suitable crosslinking agents include, for example, multifunctional compounds containing<br>
organic groups such as isocyanates, epoxides, carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, acid anhydrides,<br>
succimidyl ether aldehydes or ketones, and further may include multifunctional compounds such<br>
as alkyl methane sulfones, alkyl trifluoromethane sulfonates, alkyl paratoluene methane sulfones,<br>
alkyl halides and multifunctional epoxides. As used herein, the term "multifunctional" refers to<br>
compounds having at least three functional groups. Chain-extending agents which can be used in<br>
the present invention are mono-functional or difunctional organic compounds which react with the<br>
organic material to form an adduct but which are not necessarily capable of being crosslinked, and<br>
which are hydrophobic, that is, substantially water-insoluble. Suitable chain-extending agents<br>
include, for example, mono-functional or difunctional aliphatic hydrocarbons, heteroaliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons, organosilanes and perfluoro<br>
compounds. Examples of chain-extending agents include bisglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A,<br>
bisepoxides such as a,w-bisglycidyl polyethylene glycol, poly[bisphenol A-coepichlorohydrin]<br>
glycidyl end capped and N,Ndiglycidyl-4-glycidyloxyaniline. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
organic material comprises a biguanide compound. The biguanide compound may be a polymer<br>
comprising repeating biguanide units, such as poryhexamethylene biguanide, or be a co-polymer<br>
containing biguanide units and one or more additional organic materials. For example, the<br>
biguanide polymer may be a copolymer formed by reacting a polyepoxy compound and a<br>
biguanide compound. In a currently preferred embodiment, the organic material comprises an<br>
adduct formed by reacting polyhexamethylene biguanide with an epoxide, such as N,N-<br>
bismethylene diglycidylaniline. The resulting adduct can then be applied to a substrate and<br>
allowed to dry to form a noncrosslinked matrix or may be cured to form a crosslinked network or<br>
matrix.<br>
The biocide can be any antimicrobial material which is capable of non-leachably binding or<br>
complexing with the organic material, but which, when placed in contact with a microorganism,<br>
preferentially transfers to proteins in the microorganism. For this purpose, metallic materials<br>
which bind to cellular proteins of microorganisms and are toxic to the microorganisms are<br>
preferred. The metallic material can be a metal, metal oxide, metal salt, metal complex, metal<br>
alloy or mixture thereof. Examples of such metals include, e.g., silver, zinc, cadmium, lead,<br>
mercury, antimony, gold, aluminum, copper, platinum and palladium, their salts, oxides,<br>
complexes, and alloys, and mixtures thereof. The appropriate metallic material is chosen based<br>
upon the use to which the device is to be put. The currently preferred metallic materials are silver<br>
salts. In a currently preferred embodiment, a silver halide is used, most preferably, silver iodide.<br>
In one aspect, the antimicrobial material comprises a complex of a polycationic ligand<br>
compound and a metallic material. The polycationic compound and the metallic material form a<br>
stable, isolatable coordination complex having antimicrobial properties. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the polycationic compound is a polymer. In another preferred aspect, the<br>
polycationic compound itself has antimicrobial activity. In a currently preferred embodiment, the<br>
polycationic compound is polyhexamethylene biguanide and the metal is silver, most preferably,<br>
silver iodide. The complex preferably is in dry form, such as a powder, comprising fine particles<br>
of the complex.<br>
The invention further comprises liquid compositions for forming a contact killing, non-<br>
leaching antimicrobial layer or coating on a surface. In one embodiment, the composition is a<br>
two-part composition comprising a first solution, dispersion or suspension of an organic material,<br>
and a second solution, dispersion or suspension of a biocide. If a crosslinked coating or film is<br>
desired, the first solution, dispersion or suspension also will contain the crosslinking agent. As a<br>
first step, the crosslinking agent and the organic material may be reacted to form a non-<br>
crosslinked adduct. To form a contact-killing nonleaching coating or layer on a substrate, the first<br>
composition is applied to the substrate under conditions sufficient to immobilize the organic<br>
material on the substrate, forming a matrix. If a crosslinking agent is present, the matrix can be<br>
cured to induce crosslinking. The matrix then is exposed to the solution of the biocidal material<br>
under conditions sufficient induce the biocide to become non-leachably attached to, complexed<br>
with or associated with the matrix.<br>
In another embodiment, the liquid composition is a one part composition comprising a<br>
solution, dispersion or suspension of the organic material, the biocide, and optionally, the<br>
crosslinker. To form the contact-killing coating on a substrate, this composition is applied to the<br>
substrate under conditions sufficient to immobilize the organic material on the substrate, forming<br>
a matrix in which the biocide is non-leachably attached to or associated with the matrix.<br>
The dry powder, and the two part or one part liquid compositions also may be used to<br>
make freestanding antimicrobial films, microbeads or other solid shapes as described in more<br>
detail below. As used herein, the term "freestanding" means not attached to a substrate.<br>
The invention further provides methods for making the compositions of the present<br>
invention, and applying them to various substrates to form antimicrobial coatings or layers on the<br>
substrates, or compounding them with a carrier.<br>
Generally, the compositions are made by combining the organic polycationic material with<br>
the metallic biocide under conditions appropriate to form the complex. The conditions may vary<br>
depending upon the polycationic materials and metallic biocide selected. In one embodiment, the<br>
complex is formed by contacting a liquid solution of the polycationic material with a liquid<br>
solution of the biocidal metallic material, resulting in formation of the complex as a precipitate<br>
from the solution. The precipitate then can be dried and ground to form a powder.<br>
To make the dry or powder compositions of the invention, the organic polycationic<br>
material and the metallic biocide first may be combined in a liquid carrier to form a solution,<br>
dispersion or suspension of the complex, which then may be dried to evaporate the liquid. The<br>
drying step may be performed in any suitable manner to obtain the desired product, including<br>
spray drying, air drying, heating, etc. In one embodiment, a powder form of the complex can be<br>
prepared by combining a liquid solution of the organic material and the biocide to form a solution,<br>
dispersion or suspension of the organic material:biocide complex. The solution, dispersion or<br>
suspension then is cast as a film onto a non-adherent substrate and dried to form a film. The film<br>
then is detached from the non-adherent substrate and ground to a powder. The term "non-<br>
adherent substrate" means a substrate to which the coating or film formed from the complex will<br>
not bond, and from which it can be removed intact. In another embodiment, a complex is formed<br>
between a crosslinked form of the organic material and the biocidal metallic material. In this<br>
embodiment, the organic material is reacted with a crosslinking agent to form an adduct. The<br>
adduct then is cured to induce crosslinking. The resulting crosslinked material then is contacted<br>
with the biocidal metallic material under conditions sufficient to form the complex.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic material is polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)<br>
or an adduct formed by the reaction of PHMB with an epoxy functional compound, preferably<br>
N,N-methylenebisdiglycidylaniline (MBDGA). The adduct is formed by reacting PHMB and<br>
BMDGA by heating a mixture of the two components at a temperature of from about 90 to about<br>
95°C for about 15 minutes. The PHMB or PHMB adduct then is combined with the metallic<br>
biocide, preferably a silver salt, thereby forming a precipitate containing a complex of<br>
PHMB.MBGDA:Agl. The currently preferred silver salt is silver iodide. The resulting<br>
precipitate then is dried and can be ground to form a fine powder of the complex. Techniques for<br>
making dry powders of complexes based on organic materials and/or biocides other than PHMB<br>
and silver can be accomplished using reaction conditions and drying protocols known and<br>
available to those skilled in the art.<br>
To make the liquid compositions of the invention, a solution, dispersion or suspension of<br>
an organic material can be made or, if appropriate, as it available from the manufacturer. For<br>
example, polycationic polymers may be available in resin form (i.e., in a liquid carrier) which may<br>
be suitable for use as is, or with a slight adjustment, e.g., in the solid content. Polymer resins also<br>
may be blended with other resins or compounds; or the polymers may be reacted with or<br>
derivatized with other polymers or compounds to form copolymers, functionalized polymers or<br>
adducts. The binding and/or reaction conditions will depend upon the materials selected.<br>
In one embodiment, a liquid solution of a polycationic organic material, such as PHMB,<br>
can be used as the organic material. PHMB can be used as is, or can be reacted with another<br>
organic polymer or compound to form a copolymer, adduct or functionalized derivative.<br>
Protocols for formation of copolymers, adducts and derivatives are well known in the chemical<br>
art. In a currently preferred embodiment, described above in connection with the procedure for<br>
forming the dry composition, PHMB first is reacted with an epoxy functional compound to form<br>
an adduct. The resulting liquid solution containing the adduct can be applied as is and<br>
subsequently impregnated with the biocide as described below, or can be combined with the<br>
biocide to form a solution, dispersion or suspension of a PHMB adduct: biocide complex. In the<br>
currently preferred embodiment, PHMB is reacted with BMDGA to form the adduct, and the<br>
adduct is combined with a silver salt, preferably silver iodide, to form a PHMB.MBDGA.AgI<br>
complex. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, these techniques can be used to<br>
make complexes of organic materials and bioddes based on materials other than PHMB,<br>
MBGDA and AgI provided that the materials have the required functional characteristics, that is,<br>
the ability to form a complex which has antimicrobial properties and will not leach or release the<br>
biocide into a liquid or other substance in contact with the complex, but which will preferentially<br>
transfer the biocide to a microorganism in contact with the complex.<br>
The method for applying the liquid compositions to form an antimicrobial coating<br>
generally comprises providing a solution, dispersion or suspension the organic material, and, if a<br>
non-crosslinked material is desired, coating the solution, dispersion or suspension of the organic<br>
material onto the substrate, and drying the coating, thereby forming a matrix.<br>
If a crosslinked coating is desired, the organic material first is combined with a<br>
crosslinking agent Typically, both the organic material and the crosslinker will be in liquid form<br>
(e.g., in a solution, dispersion or suspension), and the two solutions are combined, forming a<br>
liquid mixture. The liquid may be an organic solvent, an aqueous liquid or a mixture of an organic<br>
solvent and an aqueous liquid. The organic material and the crosslinking agent then are reacted to<br>
form an adduct. The resulting adduct can be stored for later use, if desired, or can be immediately<br>
applied to a substrate.<br>
Liquid compositions containing the organic material (with or without the added<br>
crosslinker) can be applied to the substrate of choice by any suitable means for applying a liquid<br>
coating, including, for example, spraying, brushing, dipping, calendering, rod or curtain coating.<br>
The method selected to apply the composition to the substrate will depend on several factors,<br>
including the coating thickness desired and the nature and configuration of the substrate. If<br>
necessary, the surface to be coated can be cleaned or treated before the polymer solution is<br>
applied. The resulting coating is dried to form the matrix, and, if crosslinking is desired, subjected<br>
to crosslinking conditions, forming a crosslinked network. Crosslinking conditions may include<br>
thermal curing, ultraviolet curing, chemical curing or other curing methods. The matrix then is<br>
contacted with a solution of the biocide under conditions sufficient to deposit the biocidal material<br>
into the matrix such that the biocidal material becomes non-leachably associated with or attached<br>
to the matrix.<br>
Another embodiment of the method of making the coatings of the present invention<br>
comprises first combining the organic material and the biocide, then applying the mixture to the<br>
substrate to form the matrix as described above. If a crosslinked coating is desired, the organic<br>
material and crosslinking agent are reacted to form an adduct as described above, then the adduct<br>
is combined with the biocide. The resulting adduct/biocide mixture can be stored for later use, or<br>
can be immediately applied to a substrate and cured as described above to induce crosslinking,<br>
thereby forming the polymeric network having the biocide non-leachably associated therewith or<br>
attached thereto.<br>
In the methods of the invention described above, the amounts and/or concentrations of the<br>
materials used will depend upon the nature and stoichiometry of the materials used, and the end<br>
product desired. In the currently preferred embodiments, the concentration of the solution,<br>
dispersion or suspension of the organic material, or the organic adduct resin formed by the<br>
reaction of the polymer and crosslinker, typically is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20%<br>
by weight. Typically, a polymer:crosslinker ratio in the range of from about 1:1 to about 3:1<br>
(weight percent) will form crosslinked networks which will non-leachably retain the biocide and<br>
preferentially transfer the biocide to the microorganism upon contact as described herein.<br>
Solutions of the biocidal material typically comprising from about 0.005 to about 0.5 % by weight<br>
can be used to impregnate the matrix with biocide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present method, a freestanding antimicrobial material may<br>
be formed using the present antimicrobial material. In this embodiment, using the two-part<br>
compositions described above, a solution, suspension or dispersion of the organic material is cast<br>
on a non-adherent substrate and dried to form a film. If a crosslinked material is desired, the<br>
organic material and crosslinker first are combined and reacted to form an adduct as described<br>
above, and a solution, suspension or dispersion of the adduct is cast to form the film. The film is<br>
cured to induce crosslinking, as described above. The film then is contacted with a solution,<br>
dispersion or suspension of the biocidal material to deposit the biocidal material within the matrix<br>
of organic material. The film then is detached from the substrate and used as desired.<br>
Alternatively, freestanding crosslinked or non-crosslinked films can be cast using the one part<br>
liquid compositions described above. Freestanding antimicrobial materials also may be prepared<br>
using the antimicrobial materials of the present invention in other physical forms besides films,<br>
including as microbeads or solid shapes, for example, which can be prepared by compounding the<br>
antimicrobial powder with a suitable carrier, then casting or molding the object using well known<br>
techniques.<br>
In another embodiment, an antimicrobial powder may be formed by casting a freestanding<br>
film, as described above, then grinding the film to a powder. The powder also may be formed by<br>
precipitating from solution the complex between the organic material and the biocidal metallic<br>
material, drying the precipitate and grinding it to form the powder. The powder has similar<br>
contact-killing antimicrobial properties to the films and coatings described above. The<br>
antimicrobial powder can be incorporated into a carrier, such as a gel, cream or liquid, and applied<br>
to a surface to form an antimicrobial layer. For example, a formulation comprising the<br>
antimicrobial powder dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be used as a topical<br>
antiseptic and be applied to a wound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antimicrobial materials of the present invention are used to<br>
form a contact-killing surface on a substrate. To provide the contact-killing surface on the<br>
substrate, the organic compound may be attached to and/or immobilized on the substrate by any<br>
appropriate method, including covalent bonding, ionic interaction, coulombic interaction,<br>
hydrogen bonding, crosslinking (e.g., as crosslinked (cured) networks) or as interpenetrating<br>
networks, for example.<br>
In a currently preferred embodiment, the organic matrix is formed by first reacting<br>
polyhexamethylenebiguanide with N,N-bismethylene diglycidylaniline to form an adduct. Stable<br>
coating solutions of the resulting adduct have been obtained in both absolute ethanol and in<br>
aqueous ethanol. The adduct can be applied on a substrate surface either by dip-coating, brushing<br>
or spraying. Once applied to the substrate, the coating is dried to thereby form a matrix. The<br>
coating can be cured (e.g., by heating) to induce crosslinking, thereby forming a crosslinked<br>
polymeric network on the substrate. The resulting coating is optically clear, resistant to most<br>
solvents and to temperature changes, and does not delaminate, flake or crack. The coating<br>
typically is about ten microns or less in thickness, although the thickness of the coating may be<br>
varied by well- known techniques, such as increasing the solids content of the resin. A broad<br>
spectrum metallic antimicrobial, preferably a silver compound, then is introduced into the<br>
polymeric network such that it is entrapped as submicron particles, and complexes with the<br>
functional groups on the polymer. Alternatively, the metallic material is combined with the liquid<br>
containing the polymer prior to applying it to the substrate. In the currently preferred<br>
embodiment, the broad spectrum antimicrobial is a silver halide, preferably silver iodide.<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention are unique in the following respects:<br>
i) The unique nature of the antimicrobial material utilizes a cooperative effect of it"s components.<br>
This results in high biocidal activity, while maintaining almost no significant leachables into<br>
solutions it is in contact with.<br>
ii) The mechanism of action is essentially a surface mediated one, whereby organisms succumb<br>
only upon contact with the material due to the non-leaching property associated with it.<br>
in) The ability of such surfaces to remain completely inert in solution in the absence of<br>
microorganism contamination.<br>
iv) The ability of such surfaces to remain viable over multiple organism challenges with no<br>
decrease in their bioactivity.<br>
v) The utilization of such biocidal materials on an interior or exterior surface of a device, thereby<br>
eliminating the possibility of microbial colonization on the surface.<br>
vi) User friendliness and cost effectiveness of the coating for all types of applications.<br>
vii) Adaptability to existing manufacturing technology, thereby enabling large scale manufacture<br>
with minimal cost.<br>

better understood from the following specification when read in conjunction with the<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention can be combined with a variety of<br>
carriers to form bulk antimicrobial compositions, or can be coated onto a variety of substrates to<br>
form an antimicrobial coating. Both the bulk antimicrobials and the coatings are non-leaching and<br>
contact-killing. That is, they do not leach significant amounts of antimicrobial components into<br>
the surrounding environment, and will kill most microorganisms which come into contact with<br>
them.<br>
The term "microorganism" as used herein includes bacteria, blue-green algae, fungi yeast,<br>
mycoplasmids, protozoa and algae.<br>
The term "biocidal" as used herein means the killing of microorganisms, or inhibiting the<br>
growth of microorganisms, which can be reversible under certain conditions.<br>
As used herein, the terms "non-leachable" or "substantially non-leachable" means that<br>
none or very minute amounts (e.g., below a certain threshold) of the organic and/or biocidal<br>
material dissolves into a liquid environment. Preferably, this threshold is no higher than 1 part per<br>
million (ppm), and more preferably is lower than 100 parts per billion (ppb).<br>
Organic materials useful in the present invention comprise materials which are capable of:<br>
1.) reversibly binding or completing with the biocide, and 2.) insinuating the biocide into the cell<br>
membrane of the microorganism. A preferred class of materials are those having the<br>
aforementioned properties, which are capable of being immobilized on a surface and which<br>
preferentially bind a biocidal metallic material in such a manner so as to permit release of the<br>
metallic biocide to the microorganism but not to the contacting environment. Most preferred is<br>
the class of organic materials which can dissolve into, adhere to, disrupt or penetrate the lipid<br>
bilayer membrane of a microorganism. For this purpose, surface active agents, such as cationic<br>
compounds, polycationic compounds, anionic compounds, polyanionic compounds, non-ionic<br>
compounds, polyanionic compounds or zwitterionic compounds may be used. Organic materials<br>
which currently are most preferred for use in the invention include cationic or polycationic<br>
compounds such as biguanide compounds.<br>
Preferred cationic materials include benzalkoniumchloride derivatives, a-4-[l-tris(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl) ammonium-2-butenyl]poly[1-dimethylammonium-2-butenyl]-w -tris(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl) ammonium chloride, and biguanides of the general formula:<br>
or their water soluble salts, where X is any aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, substituted<br>
aliphatic, substituted aromatic, heteroaliphatic, heterocyclic, or heteroaromatic compound, or a<br>
mixture of any of these, and Y1 and Y2 are any aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, substituted<br>
aliphatic, substituted aromatic, heteroaliphatic, heterocyclic, or heteroaromatic compound, or a<br>
mixture of any of these, and where n is an integer equal to or greater than 1. Preferred<br>
compounds include, e.g., chlorhexidine (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) or<br>
polyhexamethylene biguanide (available from Zeneca Biocides, Inc. of Wilmington, DE). The<br>
above-mentioned organic materials may be modified to include a thiol group in their structure so<br>
as to allow for the bonding of the compound to a metallic substrate, or may be derivatized with<br>
other functional groups to permit direct immobilization on a non-metallic substrate. For example,<br>
the above-mentioned organic materials may be suitably functionalized to incorporate groups such<br>
as hydroxy, amine, halogen, epoxy, alkyl or alkoxy silyl functionalities to enable direct<br>
immobilization to a surface.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the organic material comprises a<br>
polycationic material which is crosslinked to form the matrix. Crosslinking agents which can be<br>
used in the present invention are those which react with the polycationic material to form an<br>
adduct which then can be reacted to form a crosslinked network or matrix. Suitable crosslinking<br>
agents include, for example, compounds containing organic multifunctional groups such as<br>
isocyanates, epoxides, carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, acid anhydrides, succimidyl ether<br>
aldehydes and ketones, and organic compounds such as alkyl methane sulfones, alkyl<br>
trifluoromethane sulfonates, alkyl paratoluene methane sulfones, alkyl halides and organic<br>
multifunctional epoxides. In a currently preferred embodiment, a polyhexamethylene biguanide<br>
polymer is reacted with an epoxide, such as N,N-methylene bisdiglycidylaniline, which then is<br>
cured to form a crosslinked network.<br>
The biocidal material can be any antimicrobial material which is capable of non-leachably<br>
binding to or complexing with the organic matrix, but which, when placed in contact with the<br>
microorganism, preferentially transfers to the microorganism. For this purpose, metallic materials<br>
which are toxic to microorganisms are preferred. The metallic material can be a metal, metal<br>
oxide, metal salt, metal complex, metal alloy or mixture thereof. Examples of such metals<br>
include, e.g., silver, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, antimony, gold, aluminum, copper, platinum<br>
and palladium, their oxides, salts, complexes and alloys, and mixtures of these. The appropriate<br>
metallic material is chosen based upon the use to which the device is to be put. The currently<br>
preferred metallic materials are silver compounds.<br>
The biocidal material can be introduced into the matrix either contemporaneously with or<br>
after application of the organic material to a surface.<br>
The invention also provides a substrate in which the surface is at least partially coated with<br>
additional organic materials, and/or biocidal materials, or both. Examples of organic and biocidal<br>
materials that can be used are discussed above. The use of a combination of at least two different<br>
organic and biocidal materials can enhance the antimicrobial properties of the coating. Different<br>
types of microorganisms can exhibit different degrees of sensitivity to different organic and<br>
biocidal materials. In addition, the use of two or more different organic and biocidal materials can<br>
significantly reduce the problem of selection for microorganisms having resistance to the organic<br>
and biocidal materials in the coating that can occur when only one is used.<br>
The amount and/or type of the antimicrobial coating which is used in a particular<br>
application will vary depending on several factors, including the type and amount of<br>
contamination which is likely to occur, and the size of the antimicrobial surface. The amount of<br>
antimicrobial used will be a minimum amount necessary to maintain the sterility of the liquid. As<br>
stated above, this amount will vary depending upon various considerations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic material, whether crosslinked or non-crosslinked,<br>
forms an insoluble, non-leachable matrix having a unique configuration: some of the organic<br>
material protrudes into the surrounding environment, that is, "arms" or "tentacles" of the organic<br>
material project away from the matrix and into the surrounding environment. This phenomenon<br>
can be understood by referring to Figures 1 and 2, which are schematic graphic illustrations of a<br>
preferred coating of the present invention in which the organic material is a crosslinked biguanide<br>
polymer and the biocidal material is a silver halide salt, preferably silver iodide. Figures 1A and<br>
1B and Figures 2A-D show the polymer matrix having tentacles projecting into the ambient<br>
environment, and the silver salt deposited in reservoirs and on the tentacles. Without wishing to<br>
be bound by theory, it is believed that when a microorganism contacts the coating, the biguanide<br>
polymer tentacles dissolve into the lipid bilayer surrounding the microorganism, thereby<br>
introducing silver molecules into the interior of the microorganism or to proteins within the cell<br>
membrane. The silver salt has a greater affinity for certain proteins in the microorganism than for<br>
the polymer, and therefore complexes with the cellular proteins and is transferred into the<br>
microorganism, thereby killing it. Specifically, it is thought that the silver forms complexes with<br>
the sulfhydryl and amino groups of the cellular proteins.<br>
In this embodiment, the silver salt is attached to or impregnated into the matrix and on the<br>
tentacles of the polymer such that the silver is substantially non-leachable. Again, not wishing to<br>
be bound by theory, it is believed that the silver salt forms complexes with functional groups in<br>
the polymer, and that the complexed silver resists leaching into ambient liquids or other materials<br>
(e.g., creams or gels) in contact with the coated surface. However, when the coating becomes<br>
exposed to cellular proteins, the silver preferentially complexes with the proteins.<br>
In a currently preferred embodiment, the polymeric material is polyhexamethylene<br>
biguanide (PHMB), the crosslinking agent is N,N-methylenebisdiglycidylaniline (MBDGA), and<br>
the silver salt is a silver halide, most preferably, silver iodide. In this embodiment, the liquid<br>
composition is made by combining a solution of polyhexamethylene biguanide with a solution of<br>
the crosslinking agent, and reacting the mixture under conditions sufficient to form a non-<br>
crosslinked PHMB-MBDGA adduct. The ratio of PHMB to MBDGA preferably is in the range<br>
of from about 1:1 to 3:1 by weight. The PHMB-MBDGA mixture is heated to about 95°C for<br>
about 2 hours in a closed reactor to form the adduct. The concentration of the resulting adduct<br>
resin preferably is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20% by weight. To form a contact-<br>
killing antimicrobial coating, the adduct resin solution is coated onto the desired substrate, and<br>
heated to a temperature sufficient to induce crosslinking between the adducts, thereby forming a<br>
crosslinked network or matrix. Temperatures sufficient for crosslinking typically are in the range<br>
of from about 70°C to about 200°C. The resulting carosslinked network is then saturated with<br>
silver by immersing the coating for about two minutes in a silver iodide/potassium iodide solution.<br>
Silver solutions having a concentration of from about 0.005 to about 0.5% can be used for this<br>
step. The silver iodide forms reservoirs in the matrix, and becomes attached to the tentacles.<br>
Silver iodide has sufficient affinity for the PHMB polymer that it forms an insoluble complex that<br>
will not leach into ambient solutions or other materials in contact with the material, even at<br>
elevated temperatures. However, when a microorganism contacts the coating, the tentacles<br>
disrupt the microorganism"s lipid bilayer membrane, thereby introducing the silver iodide into the<br>
microorganism. Silver iodide has greater affinity for certain proteins within the microorganism<br>
than for the PHMB-MBDGA matrix, and forms complexes with these proteins, that is, the silver<br>
is preferentially transferred from the coating to the microorganism. The silver accumulates to<br>
toxic levels in the microorganism and kills it. The silver iodide reservoirs within the matrix<br>
replenish the silver iodide on the tentacles lost to the microorganism by reestablishing the<br>
equilibrium for formation of the complex (AgI + PHMB = [PHMBAgI]).<br>
This invention also includes the coated substrates, freestanding films, powders and articles<br>
made in accordance with the above methods.<br>
The present invention provides stable, adherent coatings or layers using the present<br>
coating formulations on a wide range of materials, including those commonly used in membranes<br>
and in medical device manufacture. Antimicrobial coatings according to the present invention can<br>
be applied, for example, to woods, metals, paper, synthetic polymers (plastics), natural and<br>
synthetic fibers, natural and synthetic rubbers, cloth, glasses, and ceramics. Examples of synthetic<br>
polymers include elastically deformable polymers which may be thermosetting or thermoplastic<br>
such as, for example, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polyurethane, polyesters, rubbers such as polyisoprene or polybutadiene, polytetrafluoroethylene,<br>
polysulfone and polyethersulfone polymers or copolymers. The substrate can be a deformable<br>
metallic or plastic medicament container, such as a toothpaste tube, where the container may<br>
remain deformed after each dose is dispensed. Other polymeric materials, including polymeric<br>
materials which are used for the preparation of membranes or filter papers, also can serve as<br>
substrates. Examples of organic polymeric materials include polyamide (e.g., nylon),<br>
polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polyvinylidene fluoride, cellulosics (e.g., cellulose), and Teflonwwâ.<br>
The substrate can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobia With the exception of silicone and<br>
Teflonâ, which may require prior surface activation with techniques such as plasma, chemical<br>
oxidation or metallic sensitization, e.g., a primer, no surface activation is necessary. Inorganic<br>
materials to which the present coatings can be applied include glass fiber materials, ceramics such<br>
as alumina or silica, and metals, Sintered glass and sintered ceramic substrates also can be used.<br>
The coating or layer may be applied directly to most surfaces without prior surface<br>
modification. Studies simulating a year of contact between the coating and aqueous solutions at<br>
ambient temperature resulted in less than 100 ppb of any active ingredient in the solution. The<br>
extract solutions themselves (solutions which have been in contact with the coating) show no<br>
antimicrobial or mammalian cell toxicity. The coated surface remains fully inert and bio-active<br>
after exposure to various physical and chemical stresses including: low temperature, ethanol,<br>
boiling water, prolonged exposure to varying pH solutions and solutions of high ionic strength, as<br>
well as sterilization by conventional methods (e.g., wet autoclave, ethylene oxide, g-irradiation,<br>
ethanol).<br>
Surface coatings, freestanding films and formulations containing the antimicrobial powder<br>
according to the present invention exhibit antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and<br>
gram negative bacteria and yeast, and are resistant to fungal growth. Treated surfaces completely<br>
kill organisms at challenge levels of 106 - 108 CFU/mL within 8 to 20 hours at 30°C, depending<br>
on organism type. Tables 1 and 2 (in Example 4) list the bioactivity of coated surfaces towards<br>
different challenge organisms. The coating renders surfaces biofilm resistant, which coupled with<br>
its chemical inertness, makes it particularly suited for many device applications.<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention have been successfully applied on the<br>
surface of microporous membranes, including within the pores as evidenced by SEM-EDX.<br>
Stable, uniform coatings have been obtained on a variety of membrane materials with almost no<br>
reduction in their flow property. Coated microporous membranes kill micro organisms upon<br>
contact and are resistant to the phenomenon of "bacterial grow-through" which occurs even in<br>
sterilizing 0.2 uM pore size membranes in long term contact applications. Such membranes are,<br>
therefore, well suited for incorporation in devices used in long term filtration applications such as<br>
multi-dose dispensers for preservative free formulations, water purification systems and in any<br>
application where it is desirable to use barrier properties of a membrane for more than a day.<br>
The mechanism of action is one wherein the antimicrobial materials are activated only<br>
upon contact with the microorganism. Once the microorganism accumulates a toxic amount of<br>
silver, it succumbs and detaches from the surface. The coating or other treated surface, therefore,<br>
remains active only as long as viable organisms contact it, and reverts to being inert in then-<br>
absence. This unique property whereby the biological activity is triggered by bacterial cell contact<br>
enables the coating to function "intelligently." For such a contact mechanism to be effective, the<br>
rate of kill is expected to vary as a function of the ratio of total surface area of coated substrate to<br>
the volume of the bacterial suspension in contact with it (S/V ratio) at constant temperature. As<br>
shown in the Examples, time to kill experiments were performed on coated polyethylene tubes of<br>
varying inner diameter that were inoculated with predetermined volumes of a suspension<br>
containing 106 CFU/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The<br>
decrease in organism concentration was measured as a function of time at constant temperature<br>
over 20 hours. Experimental results are summarized in Figure 3. There is no substantial<br>
difference in kill rate for S/V ratios ranging from 2.5 to 5 cm-1; similar results were obtained for a<br>
ratio of 1.5. For the largest diameter tubes tested (S/V = 0.5), however, viable organisms were<br>
detected at low levels, which can be attributed to a decrease in probability of organisms<br>
contacting the surface with increasing volumes. No toxic components were found in organism-<br>
free solutions in contact with coated tubes under identical conditions when tested both chemically<br>
and biologically, which supports the proposed contact mechanism for cell death. Such a<br>
distinction would not be evident if sterilization were to occur via either controlled dissolution or<br>
diffusive elution of the coating components into solution; in either case, high levels of active<br>
components would be present in solution.<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention can be used to form contact-killing<br>
coatings or layers on a variety of substrates. As shown in the Examples, the material forms a non-<br>
leaching contact-killing surface on materials which are used in medical devices which are<br>
implanted, inserted or in intimate contact with a patient, such as catheters, urological devices,<br>
blood collection and transfer devices, tracheotomy devices, valves, stents, intraocular lenses, and<br>
on personal or health care products which topically contact the patient or other user such as<br>
toothbrushes, contact less cases and dental equipment. The antimicrobial materials of the present<br>
invention in powder form can be dispersed or dissolved in a carrier and used as a topical<br>
antiseptic, wound dressing or topical disinfectant. Such carriers may include creams, gels, lotions,<br>
soaps or other topically applicable materials. The materials can be used on medical devices and<br>
healthcare devices and products, consumer products, baby care products, personal hygiene<br>
products, household products, bathroom accessories including shower enclosures, toilet seats,<br>
sinks and countertops, kitchen surfaces, food preparation surfaces and packaging, water storage,<br>
treatment and delivery systems, biosensitive systems and laboratory and scientific equipment.<br>
For example, contact lens cases are a proven contributor to the spread of ocular pathogens<br>
and disease. A lens case coated with a coating of the present invention has been shown in vitro to<br>
kill all clinically relevant pathological strains of micro-organism without leaching toxic chemicals<br>
into the contact lens solution (see Examples 2 and 4). Once a bio-film has formed on an untreated<br>
contact lens case, it is resists virtually all types of disinfection products currently available for<br>
contact lens care. Thus, the bio-film serves as a reservoir for bacteria that re-contaminate the lens<br>
each time it is stored in the case. The treated lens case is compatible with all disinfecting solutions<br>
tested to date. Use of the coating permits sterilization of the lenses using ordinary saline as the<br>
soaking solution.<br>
The present antimicrobial materials can be used to coat ordinary nylon bristle toothbrushes<br>
(see Example 2). The treated toothbrush kills the pathogens commonly found in the human<br>
mouth and on bathroom surfaces, while untreated toothbrushes foster their growth. It is believed<br>
that toothbrushes are partly responsible for the spread of oral and dental disease. In vitro and in<br>
vivo test programs examined the types, number and kill-rates for the organisms commonly found<br>
in the mouth. The tests indicated that the treated toothbrush eliminated virtually all of these<br>
pathogens over a 12 hour period. The inert coating does not elute from the brush and therefore<br>
has no taste and poses no risk to the consumer. The present materials also can be used to provide<br>
an antimicrobial layer or to kill microbes on dental instruments, dental floss, and other devices for<br>
use in the mouth.<br>
Bio-film formation is a major problem in many water container, water filtration, and water<br>
delivery applications. Once a bio-film is formed, it typically resists further treatment and acts as a<br>
constant source of microbial contamination. Prevention of bio-film formation is key to the<br>
maintenance of high quality water systems. The present materials can be used to prevent bio-film<br>
formation on many water treatment products. For example, water containers and water<br>
purification systems used in camping, residential, commercial and military applications, which<br>
need to be periodically emptied, disinfected and rinsed. Treatment with the present antimicrobial<br>
materials would eliminate the costs and hazards associated with this process, as well as the risks<br>
associated with improper maintenance of these water storage systems.<br>
The present antimicrobial materials also are useful in point-of-use water purification filters,<br>
which trap bacteria and nutrients commonly found in all water systems. The bio-films formed in<br>
these filters often shed bacteria into the water stream in quantities exceeding the standard safety<br>
limits. Treated filters would offer longer service life and significantly reduce the potential for<br>
bio-hazard.<br>
Surfaces in medical offices, such as treatment tables, or consoles in a typical dental office<br>
have proven to be a major source of bacterial contamination, posing potential health risks to the<br>
patient and staff. .Although water supplies are routinely treated to reduce bio-contamination,<br>
water standing in the lines in the dental console can promote the formation of bio-films. Coating<br>
or treating these surfaces with the antimicrobial materials of the present invention can prevent<br>
bio-film formation on these substrates.<br>
The present antimicrobial materials have been tested against the bacteria most commonly<br>
found in water. Treated tubing withstood repeated attempts to induce bio-film formation at very<br>
high challenge levels, while untreated control tubing developed extensive bio-film (see Examples S<br>
and 11). The treated tubing showed no traces of chemical elution into the water.<br>
The present materials also can be applied to woven and non-woven fabrics used in<br>
hospitals and on healthcare supplies ranging from face masks to bed sheets. The materials can be<br>
applied in a spray or wipe form which can be applied to surfaces in order to make them<br>
antimicrobial.<br>
Long term indwelling catheters pose a risk of infections (2%-9%) which increases patient<br>
discomfort, the risk of systemic infections and the length of the patient"s hospital stay. Catheters<br>
treated with the present antimicrobial materials can reduce the presence of infection causing<br>
bacteria. The materials also can be used on urinary catheters, implants and inserts designed to<br>
deal with incontinence suffer from increased risk of infection. Coatings made with the present<br>
materials have been demonstrated to kill microorganism in human urine.<br>
The antimicrobial materials of the present invention can be used to treat standard<br>
biological plastic laboratoryware for applications which require low microbiological<br>
contamination, e.g. cell culture lab ware.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of PHMB-BMDGA Solutions<br>
Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) (available as a 20% aqueous solution from Zeneca<br>
Biocides, Wilmington, DE) was distilled to remove the water, and the PHMB was redissolved in<br>
absolute ethanol to give a 20% by weight solution. This solution was used to prepare the resins<br>
outlined below.<br>
(a) 312 mL of the 20% PHMB solution in ethanol was further diluted with 600 ml of ethanol.<br>
This solution was added to a solution of N,N-methylene bisdiglycidylaniline) (MBDGA) (Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company, Milwaukee, WI) containing 37.60 grams of MBDGA dissolved in 119.9 ml<br>
of acetonitrile and 280.1 ml of ethanol. The resulting mixture was heated at 95°C in a closed<br>
reactor for two hours, forming a PHMB-MBDGA adduct. The adduct solution was cooled and<br>
filtered (Scientific Grade 417 filter). The resulting adduct solution contained 10% by weight of<br>
PHMB:BMDGA adduct having a PHMB:MBDGA ratio of 1.5:1.<br>
(b) 330 mL of the 20% PHMB. This solution was combined with 100 ml of a sodium<br>
hydroxide (NaOH) solution containing 66 grams of NaOH, 66 ml of water and 34 ml of ethanol.<br>
This mixture was added to a solution containing 40 grains of MBGDA, 120 ml of acetonitrile and<br>
280 ml of ethanol. The resulting solution was heated at 95°C for 2 hours forming the PHMB-<br>
MBDGA adduct. The solution was cooled and filtered as described above. The resulting adduct<br>
solution contained 10% by weight of PHMB:MBDGA adduct having a PHMB:MBDGA ratio of<br>
1.5:1.<br>
The resins were characterized according to the following procedures:<br>
1. Film formation was tested by a dip test with PE/PP (polyethylene/polypropylene) in<br>
which PE/PP samples were dipped in the resin solutions made in (a) and (b) above<br>
and dried by hot air blowing, and film formation was observed;<br>
2. The ratio of polymer to crosslinker (PHMB-MBDGA) in the resin solution was<br>
tested by UV/visible spectroscopy;<br>
3. Gelation time of the resin mixture was tested.<br>
The resins were diluted with ethanol to a concentration of 1%. Film formation<br>
of the diluted resins were tested by the dip test with PE/PP as described above. Both<br>
resins formed a coherent film. The resins were stored in closed containers at ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Example 2<br>

Various plastic articles were coated using the coating solutions described in<br>
Example 1.<br>
1. contact lens cases: polyethylene and polypropylene contact lens cases were coated<br>
according to the following procedure:<br>
The contact lens cases were cleaned by immersing them in absolute ethanol for<br>
S minutes and dried. The cleaned cases were immersed in the antimicrobial coating<br>
solution (Example la or lb) for 1 to 2 minutes. The sample cases were dried by<br>
hot air blowing. Crosslinking was induced by heating the cases at 120°C for the<br>
polyethylene cases and at 200°C for the polypropylene cases for 2 hours. The cases<br>
were allowed to cool, rinsed with 60°C water to remove any unbound polymer,<br>
then dried at 60°C for 1-3 hours.<br>
The coated cases were immersed in a 0.05% solution of silver iodide/potassium<br>
iodide in alcohol for 2 minutes. The cases were rinsed with aqueous alcohol to<br>
remove any unbound silver. The cases then were rinsed with water and dried.<br>

procedure described for contact lens cases, except that the cross-linking reaction<br>
was carried out at 120-140°C.<br>
3. Polyurethane and Polyvinylchloride Catheters: polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride<br>
catheters were coated according to the procedure described for contact lens cases,<br>

polyethersulfone membrane and housing were coated according to the procedure<br>
described for contact lens cases, except that the crosslinking reaction was carried<br>
out at 80-120°C for polyurethane and 120-140°C for polyethersulfone.<br>
5. Coating Process for Silicone Parts: The parts were pre-cleaned in 100% ethyl<br>
alcohol (reagent grade) to remove dirt, grease and other contaminants. They are<br>
then subjected to an alkaline etch by immersing them in a 0.1M NaOH in 90%<br>
ethanol solution (10% water) at room temperature and ultrasonicated for 2<br>
minutes. They were then coated in an identical manner as the contact lens cases.<br>
6. Coating Process for Teflon Parts: The parts were subjected to surface pretreatment<br>
by oxygen plasma for 5 minutes in a plasma reactor. They were then coated in an<br>
identical manner as the contact lens cases.<br>
7. Coating Process for Nylon Sheets: Nylon sheets were pre-cleaned with 100% ethyl<br>
alcohol (reagent grade) to remove dirt, grease and other contaminants. The one<br>
part formulation of coating resin has been diluted with 100% ethyl alcohol to the<br>
desired concentration of 1 wt.%. The cleaned nylon sheet was immersed in the<br>
coating resin for a period of 1-2 mins. Then, the sheet was carefully removed from<br>
the coating resin bath and the excess adhering resin was allowed to drain off. The<br>
coating on the nylon sheets was dried by placing them in an oven at 70°C for 3-4<br>
mins. Then, dried resin coating was then crosslinked by thermal curing at 120°C<br>
for a period of 2 hours. The cured samples were removed from the oven and<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
This procedure was used to coat nylon toothbrush bristles, non-woven<br>
nylon and cellulose fibers.<br>
Example 3<br>
Membrane Coating Procedure<br>
Polyethersulfone and nylon membranes were cleaned as described in Example 2<br>
above. The membranes were coated with the antimicrobial resin solution described in<br>
Example 1 (1a of 1b) and dried. The coatings then were crosslinked by heating at<br>
120°C for approximately 2 hours. The resulting crosslinked coatings were rinsed with<br>
water to remove any unbound polymer, were rinsed with acidified water or buffer [pH<br>
2-2.5], followed by another water rinse, then dried. Silver was deposited into the<br>
crosslinked polymer matrix by immersing the coated membrane in a 0.05% solution of<br>
a silver iodide/potassium iodide complex in aqueous alcohol.<br>
Unbound silver iodide was removed by an ethanol wash. The membrane was<br>
rinsed with water, then dried at 70°C for 30 minutes.<br>
Example 4<br>
Contact Killing Ability<br>
The coated articles described in Example 2 and the membranes described in<br>
Example 3 were exposed to a variety of bacteria from the following genera:<br>
Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Serratia, Klebsiella, Bacillus, Enterococcus and<br>
Aspergillus, and a fungus from the genus Candida. The species of microorganisms<br>
used are listed in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
The articles and membranes were incubated with the microorganisms at 35-<br>
30°C for at least 20 hours, and for as long as 504 hours (21 days). The results are<br>
shown in Tables 1 and 2:<br>
Example 5<br>
Kinetics of antimicrobial action<br>
The coating acts upon contact with the micro-organism, first intercalating into the cell<br>
membrane and second transferring the bio-toxic agent directly to the contacting organism. The<br>
following time to kill experiment was performed on polyethylene tubes with various diameters<br>
coated with the PHMB-MBDGA-silver coating described in Example 1. Coatings were applied<br>
as described in Example 2 for the contact lens cases. The tubes were inoculated with<br>
predetermined volumes of initial concentrations of up to 109 cfu/mL of Pseiidomonas aeruginosa<br>
(ATCC#9027) in PBS and incubated at 30°C for 20 hours. At various time points tubes were<br>
sampled and the micro-organism was plated and counted. The treated tubes demonstrated<br>
significant antibacterial activity even when volume to surface ratios (S/V) exceeded 4:1. The<br>
results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
Additional evidence for the contact killing mechanism was provided by the following<br>
experiment. Polypropylene tubes were coated as described in Example 2 for contact lens cases.<br>
The coated tubes and untreated controls were challenged with 106 cfu/ml of Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa in PBS at 30°C for 20 hours. An organism count by standard plating techniques<br>
showed no viable organisms, i.e., a complete elimination (6 log decrease) compared to the<br>
untreated tubes.<br>
The solution containing the dead bacteria from the coated tubes was digested in 0.1M<br>
nitric acid and analyzed for the presence of silver. Silver concentration was found to be about<br>
600 ppb. A coated tube containing blank PBS (no bacteria) incubated for the same time showed<br>
no detectable silver in the solution (less than 10 ppb).<br>
Example 6<br>
Non-leachability of the Coatings<br>
To simulate an aging of approximately 1 year at ambient temperature; membranes with<br>
very large surface area were coated as described in Example 3. The coated membranes were<br>
immersed in water, isotonic saline and phosphate buffered saline solutions at 70°C for 5 days.<br>
The test solutions were analyzed for elutables by spectroscopic methods with sensitivities less<br>
than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of active ingredients, i.e., PHMB, BMDGA, silver and iodide. The<br>
following levels were found:<br>
Silver: less than 10 ppb (below detection limit)<br>
PHMB: less than 100 ppb (below detection limit)<br>
MBGDA: less than 300 ppb (below quantitation limit)<br>
Iodide: less than 50 ppb (below quantitation limit)<br>
These analytical results were further confirmed by testing the contact solutions to<br>
demonstrate that they show no antimicrobial activity by challenging them with silver sensitive<br>
Escherichia coli (ATCC #8739) at a concentration of 106 cfu/mL. No decrease in numbers of<br>
the microorganism was detected after 20 hours.<br>
Example 7<br>
Tonacity<br>
For assessing mammalian cell toxicity, polypropylene tubes coated as described in<br>
Example 2 for contact lens cases, were aged in phosphate buffered saline at 50°C for 48 hours.<br>
Test solutions were evaluated for toxicity with mouse fibroblast cells and showed no toxicity to<br>
the cells.<br>
Example 8<br>
Mechanical Strength<br>
Treated surfaces coated as described in Example 2 were subjected to Sutherland rub test<br>
with 4 PSI for 50 strokes and remained viable while the rubbing surface did not show<br>
antimicrobial activity.<br>
Example 9<br>
Inertness<br>
The coating remains fully inert and bio-active after exposure to a variety of physical and<br>
chemical stresses:<br>
• Low temperature (-15°C), 24 hours<br>
• Ethanol and boiling water, 1 hour<br>
• Prolonged exposure to acidic and basic solutions of varying pH (4-10), 12 hours<br>
• High ionic strength solution (2% sodium chloride), 24 hours<br>
• Autoclaving (121°C for 15 minutes)<br>
• Long term exposure to urine (35°C for 7 days)<br>
• Challenged with 0.7% human serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline in<br>
accelerated aging tests (noted a small increase in non-bioavailable silver elutables due<br>
to protein complexation) at 80°C for 72 hours<br>
• Exposure to blood products<br>
• Worn by human volunteers for a 3 day period. No skin reaction was noted<br>
Example 10<br>
Surface Bio-Activity<br>
The coating kills micro-organisms on contact - but is non-toxic to mammalian cells. In<br>
laboratory testing, treated surfaces (polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon and polyethersulfone)<br>
effectively eliminated all human pathogens tested - including bacteria, yeasts and fungi.<br>
• Bacillus cereus (ATCC#11778)-106 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>
• Escherichia coli (ATCC#8739)-106 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC#9027)- 106 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>
• Pseudomonas cepacia (ATCC#25416)-105 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>
• Pseudomonas diminuta (ATCC#19146)- 106 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>
• Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC#13883)-106 cfu/mL in 20 hours<br>

• Staphyllococus epidermidis (ATCC#12228)-105 cfu/mL in 72 hours<br>
• Candida albicans (ATCC#10231)-105 cfu/mL in 168 hours<br>
Surfaces coated as described in Example 2 were challenged with these microorganisms in<br>
the initial concentrations indicated. The microorganisms were suspended in phosphate buffered<br>
saline and were allowed to remain in contact with the treated surfaces for extended periods at<br>
30°C. The solutions were then analyzed using standard plating methods. While organism growth<br>
was documented on untreated surfaces, the microorganisms were completely eliminated on the<br>
treated samples in the specified time period. These results were confirmed in thousands of tests<br>
conducted over three years.<br>
In addition, the treated surfaces were tested against Aspergillus niger. No fungal growth<br>
was detected over the 28 day test period.<br>
Fxample 11<br>
Prevention of bio-film formation<br>
To determine efficacy against bio-film formation, polyurethane tubes coated as described<br>
in Example 2 and untreated tubes were challenged with a mixture of the following micro-<br>
organisms, incubated in a 1% synthetic growth medium at room temperature.: Pseudomonas<br>
Diminuta (ATCC#19146), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (ATCC#9027), Klebsiella Pneumoniae<br>
(ATCC#13883), Bacillus cereus (ATCC#11778), Escherichia Coli (ATCC#8739),<br>
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC#6538). Within 24 hours, the micro-organisms in untreated tubes<br>
had grown from an initial concentration of 104 cfu/mL to an average of 3x105 cfu/mL. The<br>
treated tubes had no viable micro-organisms.<br>
The tubes were then washed and refilled with water. Eight days later, the untreated tubes<br>
still yielded 105 cfu/mL (resulting from the bio-film established during the first day of incubation)<br>
while the treated tubes yielded no micro-organisms.<br>
Example 12<br>
Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria<br>
Untreated and treated (as described in Example 2) surfaces were challenged with 106<br>
cfu/mL of methicillin and neomycin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC#33592).<br>
The micro-organism was suspended in phosphate buffered saline and were allowed to remain in<br>
contact with the surfaces. Within 20 hours, treated surfaces had no viable organisms whereas the<br>
number of viable organisms on untreated surfaces remained unchanged.<br>
Example 13<br>
Preparation of the Complex of Silver Iodide with Poly(hexamethylenebiguanide)<br>
10 g of Cosmosil CQ (Zeneca, Biocides, Wilmington, DE), 10 ml of ethanol (EtOH) and<br>
1.2 g of potassium iodide (KI) were mixed together. The resulting solution was added dropwise<br>
to 400 ml of an aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) solution containing 0.5% (w/v) of silver iodide and 6%<br>
(w/v) of potassium iodide. Precipitated white rubbery product was separated from the solution,<br>
rinsed with 50 ml of 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven for 18 hours at<br>
50°C. Silver containing product obtained after drying was a transparent light yellow color<br>
semisolid resin with a silver content of 10.7%.<br>
Example 14<br>
Preparation of Potyhexamethylenebiguanide base (PHMB) from<br>
Polyhexamethylenehydrochloride Solution<br>
200 ml of Cosmocil CQ solution (Zeneca Biocides, Wilmington, DE) was neutralized by<br>
addition of 200 ml of aqueous NaOH (40 wt%) slowly with stirring, forming a precipitate. After<br>
filtering the supernatant liquid, the precipitate was suspended in 400 ml of alcohol. The PHMB<br>
suspension was diluted to 500 ml with additional alcohol and filtered. 10 ml of aliquot (filtered)<br>
gave 0.7 g of dried (100°C, 15 min) product. Calculated yield of PHMB solid in total solution<br>
was 35 g.<br>
Example 15<br>
Preparation of PHMB-Epoxide Resin (PHMB-MBDGA)<br>
17.5 g of 4,4"-methylenebisdiglycidylaniline (MBDGA) (Aldrich Chemical Company,<br>
Milwaukee) was dissolved in 70 ml of acetonitrile. The resulting MBDGA solution was added in<br>
dropwise to the PHMB solution described in Example 14 that had been preheated in a water bath<br>
to 80-90°C with stirring. The reaction mixture turned turbid during the addition. The reaction<br>
was allowed to proceed for about 30 minutes at which time the solution became clear. The<br>
reaction vessel was removed from the bath and cooled. The pH of the cooled solution was<br>
adjusted to 3.65 by slow addition of 2N alcoholic HC1 in alcohol.<br>
Example 16<br>
Preparation of the Complex of Silver Iodide with PHMB-MBDGA Resin<br>
30 ml of 10% (w/v) ethanol solution of PHMB-MBDGA (2:1 w/w) resin (prepared as<br>
described in Example 15 above) was mixed with 30 ml of anhydrous ethanol and 3.6 g of<br>
potassium iodide. The resulting solution was added dropwise to 400 ml of an aqueous ethanol<br>
(1:1 v/v) solution containing 0.5% (w/v) of silver iodide and 6% (w/v) of potassium iodide.<br>
Precipitated white rubbery product was separated from the solution, rinsed with 50 ml of 50%<br>
(v/v) aqueous ethanol, and dried in vacuum oven for 18 hours at ambient temperature. The silver<br>
containing productobtained was a transparent light yellow color solid resin with a softening point<br>
40-45°C and a silver content of 3.8%.<br>
Example 17<br>
Preparation of the Complex of Silver Iodide with Crosslinked PHMB-MBDGA Resin<br>
500 ml of 10% (w/v) ethanol solution of PHMB-MBDGA (2:1 w/w) resin was prepared<br>
as in Examples 15-17 above. The volume of obtained solution was reduced to approximately 100<br>
ml by solvent evaporation under vacuum in a rotovapor at a water bath temperature of 70°C. To<br>
accomplish solvent removal, the resulting viscous resin solution was transferred into glass beaker<br>
and placed in vacuum oven at ambient temperature. After 30 minutes of drying, the oven<br>
temperature was increased to 75°C and the sample was left in vacuum for another 16 hours. The<br>
solid product obtained was cured at 130°C for 2 hours in a regular oven. The cured resin -was<br>
ground to make resin powder with a particle size about 50 microns. A quantitative yield of<br>
crosslinked PHMB-MBDGA resin (&gt;90%) was obtained at the end of the powder preparation<br>
process.<br>
10 g of silver iodide and 55 g of potassium iodide were dissolved in a mixture of 50 ml of<br>
water and 150 ml of ethanoL Crosslinked resin powder (15 g) prepared as described above was<br>
immersed in the silver solution and left under agitation for 30 minutes. Then solid matter was<br>
separated from the supernatant and resuspended in 100 ml of anhydrous ethahol. After 10<br>
minutes of washing, the resin powder was recovered from the mixture, rinsed with a fresh portion<br>
of alcohol (50 ml) and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 16 hours. 22 g of silver<br>
loaded crosslinked PHMB-MBDGA resin powder with a 5.9% silver content was obtained after<br>
complete solvent evacuation. Before use, the resin powder was ground and sieved through a<br>
standard testing sieve to get the particle size below 53 microns.<br>
Example 18<br>
The broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the resin powder made as described in<br>
Examples 13-17 was evaluated as follows. The powder was suspended in phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS) at resin concentrations ranging from 0.05 mg/mL to 100 mg/mL.<br>
The suspensions were inoculated with the following challenge microorganisms:<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027<br>
Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 <br>
Staphylococcus aureus A TCC 6538<br>
Serratia marcescens ATCC 8100<br>
Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228<br>
Candida albicans ATCC 10231<br>
All microorganisms were inoculated as a suspension in PBS to the resin suspensions in PBS. PBS<br>
solutions without resin powder were used as controls. A bacterial challenge level of<br>
approximately 106 cfu/mL was maintained for all resin concentrations. After inoculation, the<br>
solutions were incubated at 30°C for 20 hours, following which the number of viable organisms<br>
was determined by the standard spread plate method. A pass criteria was set for the antimicrobial<br>
efficacy of the resin suspensions which required the complete elimination of each type of<br>
microorganism over the 20 hour time period.<br>
The resin powder completely eliminated alt microorganisms used in the study over the<br>
range of varying concentrations within a 20 hour time period over the entire range of resin<br>
concentrations.<br>
