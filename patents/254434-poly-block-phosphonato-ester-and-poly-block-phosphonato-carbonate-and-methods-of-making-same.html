CROSS REFERENCES AND RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The application claims priority for U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/707,304 entitled  Polymers Comprising Polyphosphonates and Polyesters and Methods of Making" filed on August 11, 2005 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/707,323 entitled Polymers Comprising Polyphosphonates and Polyesters and Methods of Making" filed August 11,2005.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Random polyesterrphosphonates and random polycarbonatophosphonates can be prepared by melt condensation from bisphenol, phosphonic acid ester monomers and carboxylic acid ester monomers or from bisphenol, phosphonic acid ester monomers and diphenyl carbonate monomers (See for example, DE-OS (German Published Specification) Nos. 2,925,206 and 2,925,20'8j. The polymers made using these methods are random (or statistical) mixtures of the monomers and these materials do not have good toughness compared to polycarbonate alone.<br>
      In U.S. Pat No. 4,782,123 coplyphosphonates are prepared by extrusion of solutions of aromatic polyesters and aromatic polyphosphonates at elevated temperatures to give copolyphosphonates. This process requires the use and then subsequent removal of organic solvent from the product mixture. This extra process and the attendant disposal of the organic solvent make this process undesirable and costly.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No 4,762,905 thermoplastic polyphosphonatocarbonates are prepared by polycondensation of at least one aromatic dihydroxy compound with a diaryl carbonate and a phosphonic acid diaryl ester in the presence of a basic polycondensation catalyst with heating under reduced pressure. These methods, again, provide statistical mixing of carbonate and phosphonate monomers in the polymer. Where blocks of phosphonate or carbonate occur in the polymer, it is difficult to control their length. The block polymer prepared from the monomers does not have good toughness compared to the polycarbonate or a good limiting oxygen index compared to the polyphosphonate.<br>
In U. S. Pat. No. 4,508,890 thermoplastic polyphosphonatocarbonates are prepared by polycondensation of at least one aromatic dihydroxy compound with a diaryl<br><br>
carbonate and a phosphonic acid diaryl ester in the presence of a neutral catalyst. Neutral catalysts are expensive and do not provide control over polyphosphonate block size in the block polymer. Also, where the neutral catalysts remains in the final polymer product, it may cause problems such as increased haze, reduced hydrolytic stability, reduced optical transparency, increased color and can catalyze the thermal degradation of the polymer during use at elevated temperature. The block polymer prepared from the monomers and neutral catalyst does not have good toughness compared to the polycarbonate or a good limiting oxygen index compared to polyphosphonate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Before the present compositions and methods are described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to the particular compositions, methodologies or protocols described, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular versions or embodiments<br><br>
only, and is not intended to limit their scope which will be limited only by the appended claims.<br>
It must also be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a "polycarbonate" is a reference to one or more polycarbonates and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. Unless defined otherwise', all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments disclosed, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present disclosure is not entitled to antedate these references.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may generally be directed to poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and poly(block-phosphonato-carbonate) prepared by the transesterification or polycondensation of oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates with polyesters and/or polycarbonates.<br>
As used herein the terms "poly(block-phosphonato-ester)" and "poly(block-phosphonato-carbonate)" refer to polymers made up of olgomeric phosphonate or polyphosphonate and polyester or polycarbonate blocks.<br>
Embodiments of the invention may also include methods used to prepare<br>
poly(block-phosphonato-ester)    and    poly(block-phosphonato-carbonate).	In     such<br>
embodiments, at least one oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate and one or more polyester and/or polycarbonate may be combined to form a mixture. A transesterification catalyst may be provided to the mixture. In some embodiments, the transesterification catalyst may be provided as residual transesterification catalyst from the reaction mixture used to prepare the oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate, and in others, the transesterification catalyst may be provided in a separate step of adding a transesterification catalyst. The reaction mixture which may include a transestereification catalyst may then be heated and generated volatile reaction by-products may be removed. The reaction may produce the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and poly(block-phosphonato-carbonate).<br><br>
The poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of<br>
embodiments of invention may exhibit superior properties, such as, but not limited to,<br>
improved impact strength, thermal stability, flame.retardance, and combinations of these<br>
compared to those of blends including polyphosphonate and polyester and/or polycarbonate<br>
prepared by conventional methods such as, for example, melt mixing. Without wishing to be<br>
bound by theory, these improved properties may arise from the chemical linkage formed<br>
between the blocks of the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and poly(block-phosphonato-<br>
cabonate) of the invention. For comparative example, blends prepared using conventional<br>
methods are not chemically linked, as evidenced by the distinct Tgs normally exhibited in<br>
blends     of    these     polymers.	Random    poly(phosphonatoester)     and    random<br>
poly(phosphonatocarbonate) prepared by reacting bisphenol, a phosphoric acid diphenylester, and a carboxylic acid diphenylester monomer and/or diphenylcarbonate monomer together at the same time, results in a statistical mixtures of the monomers having no blocks or no blocks of sufficient length to provide the characteristics of the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of the invention.<br>
In contrast, the methods and compositions of the present invention allow control over the block size of both the oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate and polyester and/or polycarbonate in the resulting poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate). In some embodiments, the block size is controlled by the choice of the polymer and/or oligomeric starting material. Therefore without wishing to be bound by theory, the number (weight percent) and block length (block size) of oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate units used to prepare the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) as well as the number and block length of the polyester and/or polycarbonate units may be responsible for the improved properties of the block polymer. The presence and type of other components, such as, for example, the type of bisphenol or the presence and type of branching agent may also contribute to the improved properties. For example, the degree of branching in the resulting poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) may be controlled by choice of linear or branched oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates, by the choice of linear or branched polyester, linear or branched polycarbonate or combinations of these, and the Mw choice of bisphenol in the oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate may control the phosphorous content of the final block polymer. The choice of components may control the flame retardancy, toughness, and heat stability (Tg).<br><br>
The mixing ratio of the polyphosphonate with the polyester may also control the properties of the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of the invention. In some embodiments, the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) may be made up of at least about 20 % to about 99.5 % phosphonate oligomer and/or polyphosphonate. The polyester and/or polycarbonate may then make up the remainder of the polymer or from about 0.5 % to about 80 % of the final poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate).<br>
Advantageously, embodiments of the present invention may provide poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) with a higher limiting oxygen index and flame retardancy polyester or polycarbonate alone and better toughness, higher glass transition temperature (Tg) than oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate alone. Moreover, the use of halogens which may be found in other flame retardant polymeric materials may be reduced or eliminates halogens. Therefore, the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate)of embodiments of the invention may be. useful for a variety of applications. For example, the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate), may provide flame retardant materials for purposes of providing housing for a variety of electronic equipment such as, but not limited to, televisions, computers, computer monitors, telephones, and cellular telephones. In other embodiments, these block polymers may provide an optically transparent and flame retardant coating for an underlying substrate such as, for example, fibrous material, cloth, metal, wire, other plastic materials, and the like.<br>
-, The oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates that may be used to make the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of embodiments of the invention may have an hrel of greater than about 1.03 as measured in 0.5 % CH2CI2, and, in certain embodiments, from about 1.03 to about 1.35. In some embodiments, the hrel may be from about 1.04 to about 1.18, and in other embodiments, from about 1.18 to about 1.35. The Tg of the oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates for use in embodiments of the invention may be from about 28 °C to about 107 °C, in some embodiments from about 28 °C to about 105 °C, and in still other embodiments from about 28 °C to about 100 °C. The oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates used in embodiments may be linear, branched, or combinations of these. Molecular weights (Mn) for oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates used in embodiments of the invention can range from about 2,000 to about 35,000 g/mol in some embodiments, from about 4,000 to<br><br>
about 18,000 g/mol in other embodiments, and from about 18,000 to about 35,000 g/mol in still others. Blocks or groups of branched or linear oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates in the final poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) may have an M„ greater man 2,000 g/mol in some embodiments and greater than 8,000 g/mol in other embodiments.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates may be prepared using the method described in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/143,230 filed June 2, 2005 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, the method for preparing oligomeric phosphonates and polyphosphonates may include combining one or more phosphonate, such as phosphonic acid diaryl ester, with one or more bisphenol to form a mixture and, optionally, a tranesterificatiori catalyst and/or branching catalyst The mixture may then be heated and volatiles generated as by-products of the polymerization reaction may be removed. Heating of the mixture may continue until the desired oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate has been produced. In some embodiments, the reaction time may be varied to obtain the desired molecular weight of product oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates, and in other embodiments, heating is stopped when the evolution of phenol has essentially stopped or has stopped.<br>

- Li embodiments of the invention directed to preparing the one or more oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate, one or more bisphenol may be present in a stoichiometric excess which may be up to about 50 mol % relative to the phosphoric acid diarylester. In some embodiments, the stoichiometric excess may be from about 2 or 3 mol<br><br>
% to up to about 15 or 1.6 mol %, and in other embodiments, the stoichiometric excess may be from about 5 mol % to about 15 mol %, from about 5 mol % to about 25 mol %, or from about 5 to about 50 mol %.<br>
In other embodiments directed to preparing the one or more oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate, the mixture of phosphoric acid diarylester and bisphenol may include a molar excess of phosphoric acid diarylester of from about 1 mol % to up to about 30 mol % relative to the bisphenol.<br>
, The temperature to which reaction mixtures used to prepare oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates may be heated may range from about 150 °C to about 310 °C in embodiments of the invention, and about 250 °C to about 300 °C in other embodiments. In some embodiments, heating may continue for about a day (24 hours), and heating may include heating to several different temperatures in this range during this or another amount of time. In some embodiments, heating may occur as a step-wise process wherein each temperature (step) occurs for a specific duration of time during the course of the polycondensation reaction, and in others, heating may be repeated on a second series of similar stages with an optional additional catalyst. For example in embodiments, the reaction may be run for about 6 to about 12 hours followed by a followed by a second period of time<br>
. Volatile reaction by-products may be removed as part of methods for preparing oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates of embodiments of the invention by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, using reduced pressure, a flow of an inert gas, or combination of these or other methods. In embodiments using reduced pressure, the pressure may be reduced using for example, a vacuum, and the reaction may take place at a pressure of from about 280 to about 0.1 millibar. In other embodiments, a flow of inert gas may be used to remove volatile by-products. In certain embodiments, inert gas may be used in combination with a continuous vacuum. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the amount of hydroxy aromatic compounds and/or other generated by-products removed from the reaction mixture may provide an oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate with the hrel, Tg, phosphorous content, LOI, impact strength, or any combination of these necessary to meet the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) anticipated application and/or processing requirements. In some embodiments removal of a sufficient amount of generated by-product in the reaction of an oligomeric polyphosphonate and/or polyphosphonate with a polyester and/or   polycarbonate   provides   a   poly(block-phosphonato-ester)    and/or   poly (block-<br><br>
phosphonato-cabonate) with a limiting oxygen index greater that of the polyester and/or polycarbonate and a Tg greater than that of the oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonates used in. its production.:<br>
Oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonates prepared in embodiments of the invention may be prepared by a batch, semibatch, or a continuous process. The material and the structure of the reactor used in embodiments of the present invention may not be particularly limited as long as the reactor has the capability of stirring, heating, and reducing pressure and has ports for addition and removal of reagents, solvents, catalyst, and/or reaction by- products. In certain embodiments of the invention, the reactor may be equipped, for example with a temperature controlled condenser or cold finger, for the selective removal of by-product like hydroxy aromatic compounds or phenol derived compounds, or phosphodiester or diphenyl carbonate.<br>
Advantageously lower purity monomers can be used to make the oligomeric pnospnonates and/or polyphosphonates. This is a major advantage because it mitigates the need for additional purification steps, which contributes to cost reduction. By following the method of the present invention, branched oligomeric phosphonates and or polyphosphonates can be combined with polyesters like a polycarbonate to form polymers that have advantageous flame resistance, heat stability, toughness, and are melt processable. In addition, a second heating step after the reaction with optionally added catalyst can be used to impart improved hydrolytic stability and extremely clear, haze-free oligomeric phosphonates and/or polyphosphonates.<br>
Embodiments of the invention provide for methods for using the oligomeric phosphonates'  and/or polyphosphonates described hereinabove to make poly(blcck-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) with a controlled amount and size (also referred to as block length) of oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonates. The ability to control the amount and size distribution of oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate and to chemically link the oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate to a polyester and/or polycarbonate may be advantageous over those prepared by conventional methods because a, uniform product having a single Tg can be prepared. Furthermore, conventional meuiods for preparing poly(phosphonatoester) and/or poly(phosphonatocabonate) may result in statistical mixtures of phosphonate and carbonate groups. Moreover, conventional methods, including blending of low molecular weight or oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate with polyester and/or polycarbonate under conditions where transesterification does not occur, result in a product having low toughness,<br><br>
low heat stability (two distinct Tgs) and a low limiting oxygen index. In summary, the block polymers of embodiments of the invention may allow for advantageous properties with respect to the application of the polymer due to the ability to more tightly control the amount and size of the components of the polymer and the chemical linkage between these components.<br>
The poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of embodiments of the invention may be characterized by being formed from at least one oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate and one or more polyester and/or polycarbonate where the at least one oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonate and one or more polyester or polycarbonate may be covalently linked to one another which, in general, may lead to one Tg. The poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) of embodiments of the invention may also be characterized as having a higher phosphorous content than the starting polyester, and an improved limiting oxygen index over the starting polyester.<br>
Oligomeric phosphonate and/or polyphosphonates of embodiments of the invention produced as described above may be used to make poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) by combining them with one or more polyester or polycarbonate, such as but not limited to, polyester and polycarbonate polyesters, providing a transeterification catalyst to make a reaction mixture, heating the reaction mixture and removing volatiles.<br>
