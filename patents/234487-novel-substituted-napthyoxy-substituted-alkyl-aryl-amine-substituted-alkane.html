				<td>NOVEL α-SUBSTITUTED NAPHTHYLOXY ϖ-SUBSTITUTED ALKYL/ARYL AMINO-SUBSTITUTED ALKANE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel α-substituted-naphthyloxy ϖ- substituted alkyl/aryl-amino substituted alkane, their preparation and use as antihyperglycemic agents and for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders (CVS) such as lipid lowering effects.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An analysis of the molecular structure of active PPAR-agonists mentioned above would suggest the presence of three distinct substructures. (I) the thiazolidine 2,4-dione unit 'A', (ii) the intermediate alkyl chain 'B' and (iii) the aryl substituent 'C. Since the thiazolidine 2,4-dione derivatives are associated with side effects such as liver toxicity etc, a molecular modification to eliminate such a unit was considered desirable. In the present invention the thiazolidine 2,4-dione unit has been replaced by substituted amino residues which has resulted in novel compounds showing the desired anti-hyperglycemic activity along with lipid lowering activity which is an added desirable activity.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Prior Art<br>
PPAR-agonists which act as insulin sensitizers are showing promise in the treatment of NIDDM (Type II diabetes) which is a disease prevalent in developed as well as developing<br><br><br>
countries. A number of agents show PPARy agonist activity. Most of these compounds are thiazolidine 2, 4-dione derivatives. Some of the compounds belonging to this class which have entered in clinic are Pioglitazone (Momose, Y.; Takeda, H.; Hatanaka, C.; Oi, S.; Sohda, T. Chem.Pharm.Bull.1991, 39, 1440-1445), Rosiglitazone (Cantello, B.C.C.; Cawthome, M.A.; Haigh, D.; Hindley, R.M.; Smith, S.A.; Thurlby, P.L. Bio-org. Med.Chem.Lett. 1994,4,1181-1184), Netoglitazone (Viton, R.; Widdowson, P.S.; Ishii, S.; Tanaka, H.; Wikllain, G. British J. Pharmacolgy 1998, 125, 1708-14), Troglitazone( Yoshida, T.; Fujita, T.; Kanai, T.; et al J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32,421-428).<br>

Biological Activity<br>
A	ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY<br>
ANIMALS:<br>
Adult male and female albino rats (Sprague Dawley) of body weight 160±20g, bred in CDRI animal house were used during the course of experiment; 6 animals were kept in one cage. All the animals were fed ad-lib standard pellet diet (Lipton, Bombay) and allowed unrestricted access to water. The following norms were followed for animal room environment. Temperature: 22 ± 1°C; Humidity: 50-50%; Light 300 Lux at floor level with regular 12 hours light cycle; noise level 50 decibels; ventilation 10-50 air changes per hour. 38<br>
The blood-glucose lowering effects of the test samples/standard drugs were examined in the following two experimental models. Sucrose-loaded rat model:<br>
Overnight fasted male Sprague Dawley rats were used for the sucrose-loaded experiment. Blood was collected at 'O'min from the tail vein of the animals. After the '0' min blood collection, samples/drugs were given to the test group consisting of 5 rats by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Half an hour post test sample treatment, a sucrose-load of 10.0 gm/kg body weight was given to each rat. The blood was collected at 30, 60, 90 &amp; 120 min post sucrose-load. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model:<br>
Single-dose effect; Sprague Dawley strain male albino rats of average body weight 160±20 g were selected for this study. A calculated amount of the fresh solution of STZ dissolved in 100 mM citrate buffer (ph 4.5) was injected to overnight fasted rats (60 mg/Kg) intraperitoneally. Blood was checked for glucose content 48 h later by glucometer &amp; animals showing blood glucose profile above 250 mg/dl were selected and were divided into different groups. Blood-glucose levels were again tested at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 24 h<br><br>
post test sample/drug administration. Food but not water was withdrawn from the cages<br>
during the experiment.<br>
Sucrose challenged Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model:<br>
Single-dose effect; Sprague Dawley strain male albino rats of average body weight 160±20 g were selected for this study. A calculated amount of the fresh solution of STZ dissolved in 100 mM citrate buffer (ph 4.5) was injected to overnight fasted rats (60 rag/Kg) intraperitoneally. Blood was checked for glucose content 48 h later by glucometer &amp; animals showing blood glucose profile between 150-250 mg/dl were selected and were divided into different groups. Half an hour post test sample treatment, a sucrose-load of 2.5 g/kg body weight was given to each rat. Blood-glucose levels were again tested at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 min and 24 h post test sample/drug administration. Food but not water was withdrawn from the cages during the experiment. 39<br>
(1)   Hypoglycaemic   activity   of  Test   Compounds   (compound   no.   1   and   4), Glybenclamide and Gliclazide in normal rats:<br>
The antidiabetic effect of test compounds (compound no.l and 4) and standard drug Glybenclamide, Gliclazide on OGTT of normal rats was determined. At 100-mg/kg doses level, test compounds 1, 4, Glybenclamide and Gliclazide showed significant lowering 33.6%, 37.6%, 33.9% and 44.8% respectively, at 120 min post glucose load. 2) Hypoglycaemic activity of example 1, Glybenclamide and Gliclazide in STZ-induced diabetic rats:<br>
The effect of Test compound 1 and standard antidiabetic drug Glybenclamide and gliclazide on blood glucose lowering in STZ-induced diabetic rats were determined. At 100 mg/kg dose level compound 1, Glybenclamide and gliclazide showed significant lowering on blood glucose. The lowering started from 1-hour that persisted up to 7-hours post drug administration. The lowering was of the order 28.0%, 32.8% and 27.7% respectively in case of test compound 1, Glybenclamide and gliclazide.<br>
B.       LIPID LOWERING ACTIVITY<br>
Lipid lowering activity of compound-1 was evaluated in two different models in vivo. (a)Triton Model: Male Charles foster rats weighing 200-225 g were divided into control, hyperlipedemic and hyperlipedemic plus drug treated groups containing six animals each. Hyperlipedemia was induced by administration of triton WR-1339(400mg/kg,IP). All animals were maintained on standard pellet diet and water ad lib.Test compound no. 1 and Gugulipid (standard drug) were macerated with 2% aqueous gum acacia and this suspension was fed orally at the dose of lOOmg/kg simultaneously with triton. The animals of control group received same amount of gum acacia. At the end of experiment, after 18 hrs , blood was withdrawn from retro orbital plexus and plasma was used for the assay of total cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride by standard spectrophotometric method. Results: Administration of triton in rats produced marked hyperlipedemia as observed by the increased levels of plasma cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride by 2.92,3.32,<br>
3.64 folds respectively (Table-1).<br>
Treatment with compound -1 and gugulipid significantly lowered the plasma levels of cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride by 26,33 and 28% as well as 35,31,and 35% respectively in triton plus drug treated groups.<br>

(b) Dyslipemic Hamster Model: Male golden Syrian hamster weighing 120-130 gm were<br>
divided into control, dyslipemic and dyslipemic plus drug treated group of 8 animals in<br>
each.<br>
Dyslipemia was produced by feeding with fructose rich high fat diet(HFD).Dyslipemic<br>
hamsters had free acccess to HFD and water ad. Lib for 10 days(daylto daylO).<br>
Compound 1 was macerated in vehicle containing 0.2%CMC + 0.4% tween-80 in distilled<br>
water and fed orally at the dose of 300 D mole/kg from day 4 to day 10 simultaneously<br>
with HFD feeding to hamster. Control animals received same amount of vehicle. At the<br>
end of the experiment on 10th day, blood was withdrawn and plasma was used for assay of<br>
triglyceride(Tg), cholesterol(chol), high density lipoprotein (HDL), glucose, glycerol and<br>
free fatty acids(FFA) by standard spectrophotometric methods on auto analyser. In another<br>
set of experiment antidyslipemic activity of fenofibrate at the dose of 1 GOOD mole/kg was<br>
evaluated.<br>
Results: Feeding with HFD produced marked dyslipemia in hamsters. Plasma level of Tg,<br>
chol, glycerol and FFA were shown to increase by 800,214, 167 and 215%<br>
respectively followed by a significant increase in the levels of glucose and HDL by 116 and 19% respectively. Feeding with test compound reduced levels of plasma Tg, chol, glycerol, HDL and glucose by 48,8,14,15 and 31% respectively. No significant change in<br>
FFA levels was observed. Similarly in another experiment with finofibrate (standard drug), the lowering in plasma, Tg, chol, glucose, glycerol and FFA was 77,30,33,52 and 53% respectively followed by 33% increase in plasma HDL in HFD fed dyslipemic hamsters.<br>
