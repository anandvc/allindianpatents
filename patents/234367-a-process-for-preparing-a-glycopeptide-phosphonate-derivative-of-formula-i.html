PROCESS FOR PREPARING GLYCOPEPTIDE PHOSPHONATE DERIVATIVES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to novel processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics. More specifically, this invention is directed to multi-step processes for preparing phosphonate derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics having an amino-containing side chain, the first two steps being conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the intermediate reaction products.<br>
Background<br>
Glycopeptides (e.g. dalbaheptides) are a well-known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms (see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)). Many synthetic derivatives of such glycopeptides are also known in the art and these derivatives are typically reported to have improved properties relative to the naturally-occurring glycopeptides, including enhanced antibacterial activity. For example, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/847,042, filed May 1, 2001, describes various glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives, some of which contain an amino-containing side chain. Such phosphate derivatives are particularly useful as antibiotics for treating gram-positive infections.<br>

Process Conditions<br>
The process of the present invention is conducted in three steps beginning with vancomycin or a salt thereof The first step of the process is a reductive alkylation step which involves first combining one equivalent of vancomycin or a salt thereof, with one or more equivalents of ah aldehyde of formula II::<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined herein to form a imine and/or hemiaminal intermediate in situ.<br>
The aldehydes of formula II employed in the process of the present invention are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents. For example, see WO 00/39156, published on July 6, 2000, which describes various methods for preparing such aldehydes.<br>
Typically, the vancomycin or a salt thereof and the aldehyde are combined in an inert diluent in the presence of an excess amount of a suitable base to form a reaction mixture. Preferably, the inert diluent is A^dimethylformamide, Af,iV-dimethylacetamide, 7^-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile/water, and the like or<br><br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably, from about 1 to about 2 equivalents of the aldehyde are employed; more preferably, about 1.1 to about 1.2 equivalents. In this reaction mixture, a mixture of imines and/or hemiaminals is believed to be formed between the aldehyde and the basic nitrogen atoms of vancomycin, i.e., the vancosamine nitrogen atom and the JV-terminal (leucinyl) nitrogen atom.<br>
Formation of the imine and/or bemiaminal intermediate is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 75°C, preferably at ambient temperature (i.e., about 20-25°C) for about 1 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 6 to 12 hours, or until formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal is substantially complete.<br>
Any suitable base may be employed to neutralize the vancomycin salt and to facilitate formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal, including organic bases, such as amines, alkali metal carboxylate salt (i.e., sodium acetate and the like) and inorganic bases, such as alkali metal carbonates (i.e., lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the like). Preferably, the base is a tertiary amine including, by way of illustration, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, A^-methylmorpholine, and the like. A preferred base is diisopropylethylamine. The base is typically employed in a molar excess relative to vancomycin. Preferably, the base is used in an amount ranging from about 1.5 to about 3 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 1.8 to 2.2 equivalents.<br>
When formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal mixture is substantially complete, the reaction mixture is acidified with an excess of acid. Any suitable acid may be employed including, by way of illustration, carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid and the like), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. Preferably, the acid is trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid. The acid is typically added in a molar excess relative to vancomycin (and the base). Preferably, the acid is used in an amount ranging from about 3 to about 6 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 3.5 to 5.5 equivalents.<br><br>
While not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the acid selectively hydrolyzes the koine and/or hemiaminal formed at the ^-terminal amine of vancomycin in preference to the imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the vancosamine nitrogen atom. Acidification of the reaction mixture is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C, preferably at about 25°C, for about 0.25 to about 2.0 hours, preferably for about 0.5 to about 1.5 hours. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is added during this step including, by way of example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, and the like. Alternatively, a mixed polar protic/non-protic solvent may be used, such as methanoVtetrahydrofuran, methanol/1,2-dimethoxyethane and the like<br>
After acidification, the reaction mixture is contacted with a reducing agent to reduce the imine and/or hemiaminal. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed , which is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, zinc borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, tert-butylamine/borane, iV-methylmorpholine/borane, ammonia/borane, dimethylamine/borane, triethylamine/borane, trimethylamine/borane, and the like. Preferred reducing agents are amine/borane complexes such as pyridine/borane and fert-butylamine/borane.<br>
The reduction phase of the reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C, preferably at about 25°C, for about 0.5 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 1 to about 6 hours, or until the reduction is substantially complete. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is present during this reduction step. The polar, protic solvent is preferably added during the acidification described above.<br>
In contrast to prior procedures, the product of the reductive alkylation process is not isolated but the reaction mixture is contacted with an amine to remove the protecting group (i.e., R3) from the intermediate product. Any suitable amine may be used in this step of the process. Representative amines suitable for use include, byway of example, methylamine, ethylamine, /gr/-butylamine,<br><br>
triethylamine, piperidine, morpholine, ammonium hydroxide, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and the like. Preferred amines are methylamine, te/?-butylamine, ammonium hydroxide and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.<br>
This deprotection step is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 60°C? preferably at about 40°C to about 45°C, for about 2 to about 60 hours, preferably for about 3 to about 10 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. This step is typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as N,N-dunethylformaniide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, and the like. The resulting compound of formula IV is readily isolated and purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation, filtration and the like.<br>
In the next step of the process, the compound of formula IV is contacted with formaldehyde and a compound of formula V:<br><br>
wherein R4 is as defined herein; in the presence of a base to provide a compound of formula I, or a salt thereof.<br>
This step of the process is typically conducted by contacting one equivalent of compound IV or a salt thereof with one or more equivalents, preferably with about 2 to about 10 equivalents of a compound of formula V, and with an excess, preferably with about 4 to about 5 equivalents, formaldehyde in the presence of a base.<br>
Phosphonate compounds of formula V are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and reagents. See for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Jerry March, 4th ed., 1992, John Wiley and Sons, New York, page 959; and Frank R. Hartley (ed.) The Chemistry of Organophosphorous Compounds, vol. 1-4, John<br><br>
Wiley and Sons, New York (1996) . Aminomethylphosphonic acid is commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br>
The formaldehyde employed in this step of the process is typically added in an aqueous solution, for example, as a 37 wt. % solution in water optionally containing about 5 to about 15 wt. % methanol (i.e., Formalin).<br>
Any suitable base may be used in this reaction including, for example, organic bases such as tertiary amines, and inorganic bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides (i.e., sodium hydroxide). Preferably, the base is a tertiary amine including, by way of example, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, and the like. A preferred tertiary amine is diisopropylethylamine. Preferably, the molar ratio of tertiary amine to compound V is about 3:1 to about 5:1; more preferably, about 3.5:1 to about 4.5:1; and still more preferably, about 4:1. Preferably, the pH of the reaction mixture is preferably about 10 to about 11.<br>
Preferably, this reaction is conducted in an inert diluent, such as water, acetonitrile/water and the like. In a preferred embodiment, this step of the process is conducted in acetonitrile/water or water having v/v ratio ranging from about 3:2 to completely water.<br>
This step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about -20°C to about 20°C, preferably at about -10°C to about -5°C, for about 6 to about 48 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
The resulting compound of formula I or a salt thereof is isolated by conventional procedures including, precipitation, filtration and the like. In a preferred isolation procedure, the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to about 2 to about 3 by addition of a suitable acid, such as aqueous hydrochloride acid. Preferably, the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained below about 5°C during acidification. Acetonitrile is then added to promote precipitation of the reaction product (i.e., a compound of formula I) and the resulting precipitate is collected by filtration and optionally washed with additional acetonitrile.<br>
If desired, the reaction product can be further purified using reverse-phase HPLC or other chromatographic methods. In a preferred embodiment, the product is<br><br>
purified using a resin as described in co-pending U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
	(Attorney Docket No. P-135-PR1), filed on even date herewith; which<br>
application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/314,712, filed on August 24,2001; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Among other advantages, the process of the present invention provides for improved yield, purity and selectivity, i.e., reductive alkylation at the vancosamine amino group is favored over reductive alkylation at the //-terminus (e.g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1. Additionally, because the reductive alkylation and deprotection steps are conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the reaction intermediates, the process of the present invention is more efficient, provides a higher yield and generates less waste then previous processes.<br>
The glycopeptide derivatives produced by the process of this invention are useful as antibiotics. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/847,042, filed May 1, 2001; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
