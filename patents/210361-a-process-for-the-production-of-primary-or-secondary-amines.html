				<td>A catalytic transfer hydrogenation process is provided. The process can be employed to transfer hydrogenate N-substituted imines and iminium salts, which are preferably prochiral. The catalyst employed in the process is preferably a metal complex with one hydrocarbyl or cyclopentadienyl ligand and which is also coordinated to defined bidentate ligands. Preferred metals include rhodium, ruthenium and iridium. Preferred bidentate ligands are diamines and aminoalcohols, particularly those comprising chiral centres. The hydrogen donor is advantageously a mixture of triethylamine and formic acid. A process for the production of primary and secondary amines using the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the N-substituted imines and iminium salts is also provided.</td>

It will be recognised that the precise nature of A and B will be determined by whether A and/or B are formally bonded to the metal or are coordinated to the metal via a lone pair of electrons.<br>
The groups A and B are connected by a linking group E. The linking group E achieves a suitable conformation of A and B so as to allow both A and B to bond or coordinate to the metal, M. A and B are commonly linked through 2, 3 or 4 atoms. The atoms in E linking A and B may carry one or more substituents. The atoms in E, especially the atoms alpha to A or B, may be linked to A and B, in such a way as to form a heterocyclic ring, preferably a saturated ring, and particularly a 5, 6 or 7-membered ring. Such a ring may be fused to one or more other rings. Often the atoms linking A and B will be carbon atoms. Preferably, one or more of the carbon atoms linking A and B will carry substituents in addition to A or B. -Substituent groups include those which may substitute R1, as defined above. Advantageously, any such substituent groups are selected to be groups which do not coordinate with the metal, M. Preferred substituents include halogen, cyano, nitro, sulphonyl, hydrocarbyl, perhalogenated hydrocarbyl and heterocyclyl groups as defined above. Most preferred substituents are C^ alkyl groups, and phenyl groups. Most preferably, A and B are linked by two carbon atoms, and especially an optionally substituted ethyl moiety. When A and B are linked by two carbon atoms, the two carbon atoms linking A and B may comprise part of an aromatic or aliphatic cyclic group, particularly a 5, 6 or 7-membered ring. Such a ring may be fused to one or more other such rings. Particularly preferred are embodiments in which E represents a 2 carbon atom separation and one or both of the carbon atoms carries an optionally substituted aryl group as defined above or E represents a 2 carbon atom separation which comprises a cyclopentane or cyclohexane ring, optionally fused to a phenyl ring.<br>
E preferably comprises part of a compound having at least one stereospecific centre. Where any or all of the 2, 3 or 4 atoms linking A and B are substituted so as to define at least one stereospecific centre on one or more of these atoms, it is preferred that at least one of the stereospecific centres be located at the atom adjacent to either group A or B. When at least one such stereospecific centre is present, it is advantageously present in an enantiomerically purified state.<br>
When B represents -O- or -OH, and the adjacent atom in E is carbon, it is preferred that B does not form part of a carboxylic group.<br>

Further diamines that may be represented by A-E-B are 1,2-diaminocyclopentanes and 1,2-diaminocyclohexanes, preferably fused to a phenyl ring.   The amino groups may advantageously be N-tosylated.  When a diamine is represented by A-E-B, preferably at least one amino group is N-tosylated. The aminoalcohols or diamines are advantageously substituted, especially on the linking group, E, by at least one alkyl group, such as a C^-alkyl, and particularly a methyl, group or at least one aryl group, particularly a phenyl group.<br>
Specific examples of compounds which can be represented by A-E-B and the protonated equivalents from which they may be derived are:<br><br><br><br><br>
OH	NH2	HO<br>
Preferably, the enantiomerically and/or diastereomerically purified forms of these are used. Examples include (1S,2R)-(+)-norephedrine, (1R,2S)-(+)-cis-1-amino-2-indanol, (1 S,2R)-2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol, (1 S,2R)-(-)-cis-1 -amino-2-indanol, (1 R,2S)-(-)-norephedrine, (S)-(+)-2-amino-1-phenylethanol, (1R,2S)-2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanoi, N-tosyl-(1 R,2R)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine, N-tosyl-(1 S,2S)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine, (1 R,2S)-cis-1,2-indandiamine, (1 S,2R)-cis-1,2-indandiamine, (R)-(-)-2-pyrrolidinemethanol and (S)-(+)-2-pyrrolidinemethanol.<br>

Basic ligands which may be represented by Y include water, CM alcohols, C^ primary or secondary amines, or the hydrogen donor which is present in the reaction system. A preferred basic ligand represented by Y is water.<br>
Most preferably, the nature of A-E-B, R27 and Y are chosen such that the catalyst is chirai. When such is the case, an enantiomerically and/or diastereomerically purified form is preferably employed. Such catalysts are most advantageously employed in asymmetric transfer hydrogenation processes. In many embodiments, the chirality of the catalyst is derived from the nature of A-E-B.<br>
Examples of catalysts which may be employed in the process of the present invention include<br><br><br>
The process is carried out preferably in the presence of a base, especially when Y is not a vacant site. The pKa of the base is preferably at least 8.0, especially at least 10.0. Convenient bases are the hydroxides, alkoxides and carbonates of alkali metals; tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium compounds. Preferred bases are sodium 2-propoxide and triethyiamine. When the hydrogen donor is not an acid, the quantity of base used can be up to 10.0, commonly up to 5.0, often up to 3.0, frequently up to 2.5 and especially in the range 1.0 to 3.5, by moles of the catalyst. When the hydrogen donor is an acid, the catalyst may be contacted with a base prior to the introduction of the hydrogen donor.  In<br>
15<br><br>
such a case, the mole ratio of base to catalyst prior to the introduction of the hydrogen donor is often from 1:1 to 3:1, and preferably about 1:1.<br>
Although gaseous hydrogen may be present, the process is normally operated in the absence of gaseous hydrogen since it appears to be unnecessary.<br>
Advantageously, the process is carried substantial absence of carbon dioxide. Preferably, the process is carried out under a substantially inert atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon.<br>
When the product(s) from dehydrogenation of the hydrogen donor is volatile, for example boils at under 100°C, the removal of this volatile product is preferred. The removal can be accomplished by distillation preferably at less than atmospheric pressure or by use of inert gas sparging. When reduced pressure distillation is employed, the pressure is often no more than 500 mmHg, commonly no more than 200 mmHg, preferably in the range of from 5 to 100 mmHg, and most preferably from 10 to 80 mmHg. When the product(s) from dehydrogenation of the hydrogen donor is a gaseous material, for example when formic acid is present as a hydrogen donor, the removal is most preferably accomplished by the use of inert gas sparging, with for example nitrogen.<br>
Suitably the process is carried out at temperatures in the range of from minus 78 to plus 150°C, preferably from minus 20 to plus 110°C and more preferably from minus 5 to plus 60°C. The initial concentration of the substrate, a compound of formula (1), is suitably in the range 0.05 to 1.0 and, for convenient larger scale operation, can be for example up to 6.0 more especially 0.25 to 2.0, on a molar basis. The molar ratio of the substrate to catalyst is suitably no less than 50:1 and can be up to 50000:1, preferably between 100:1 and 5000:1 and more preferably between 200:1 and 2000:1. The hydrogen donor is preferably employed in a molar excess over the substrate, especially from 5 to 50 fold or, if convenience permits, greater, for example up to 500 fold. After reaction, the mixture is worked up by standard procedures.<br>
During the reaction a solvent may be present, preferably a polar solvent, for example methanol, ethanol or i-propanol, more preferably a polar aprotic solvent, for example acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or dichloromethane. Conveniently, the hydrogen donor may be the solvent when the hydrogen donor is a liquid at the reaction temperature, or it may be used in combination with other solvents. In certain embodiments it is preferable to use a diluent. Diluents include non-polar solvents such as toluene. Usually it is preferred to operate in substantial absence of water, but water may be present in the reaction. If the hydrogen donor or the reaction solvent is not miscible with water and the desired product is water soluble, it may be desirable to have water present as a second phase extracting the product, pushing the equilibrium and preventing loss of product optical purity as the reaction proceeds. The concentration of substrate may be chosen to optimise reaction time, yield and enantiomeric excess.<br><br><br>
                                                                   16<br><br>
The catalytic species is believed to be substantially as represented in the above formula. It may be employed as an oligomer or metathesis product, on a solid support or may be generated in situ.<br>
In certain embodiments it has been found that certain catalysts are preferred for the transfer hydrogenation of imines and iminium salts. Catalysts in which A-E-B is derived from N-tosyldiamines, preferably mono-N-tosyldiamines, particularly mono-N-tosylated ethylenediamines, are preferred. Especially, M is also ruthenium (II) and R27 is an aryl group or cyclopentadienyl group, or M is iridium (I) or rhodium (I) and R27 is cyclo-octadiene, or M is iridium (III) or rhodium (III) and R27 is a cyclopentadienyl group. Further, triethylamine is preferably employed as a base, a mixture of formic acid and triethylamine in the preferred ratio of 5:2 (formic acid:triethylamine) is preferably employed as hydrogen donor. When an iminium salt is present, it is preferably a protonated imine, or is a methylated or benzylated imine with an iodide, formate or trifluoroacetate counter ion. It is believed that when Y is not a vacant site, R27 is a neutral ligand and when M is rhodium or iridium and is in valence state (I), A-E-B attaches to M by means of two dative bonds (the lone pairs of the heteroatoms in both A and B coordinate to M). However, when Y is not a vacant site, R27 is a cyclopentadienyl ligand and when M is rhodium or iridium and is in valence state (III), A-E-B attaches to M by means of one dative and one formal bond. Whereas when Y is not a vacant site, R27 is a neutral ligand and when M is ruthenium and is in valence state (II), A-E-B attaches to M by means of one dative and one formal bond.<br>
The catalyst can be made by reacting a metal aryl, alkenyl or cyclopentadienyl halide complex with a compound of formula A-E-B as defined above or a protonated equivalent from which it may be derived, and, where Y represents a vacant site, reacting the product thereof with a base. The metal aryl or alkenyl halide complex preferably has the formula [MR27Z2]Z when M is ruthenium (II) and has the formula [MR27Z]2 when M is iridium (I) or rhodium (I), wherein R27 is an aryl or alkenyl ligand as defined above, and Z represents a halide, particularly chloride. The metal cyclopentadienyl halide complex preferably has the formula [MR27Z]2 or [MR27Z]4 when M is ruthenium (II) and has the formula [MR27Z]2 when M is iridium (III) or rhodium (III), wherein R27 is an optionally substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand as defined above, and Z represents a halide, particularly chloride.<br>
For the preparation of the catalysts according to the present invention, a solvent is preferably present. Suitable reaction temperatures are in the range 0-100, for example 20-70, °C, often giving reaction times of 0.5-24.0 h. After reaction is complete, the catalyst may if desired be isolated, but is more conveniently stored as the solution or used soon after preparation. The solution can contain the hydrogen donor and this, if a secondary alcohol, may be present in or used as the solvent for steps (a) and/or (b). The preparation<br><br><br><br>
                                                                 17<br><br><br><br>
and after-handling should preferably be under an inert atmosphere, and particularly in carbon dioxide and oxygen-free conditions.<br>
The catalyst or catalyst solution is generally treated with base either just prior to use in a transfer hydrogenation reaction, or during use. This can be accomplished by adding base to the catalyst in solution, or to the compound of formula (1) in solution, or by addition to the transfer hydrogenation reaction.<br>
Transfer hydrogenation can be accomplished by transferring the solution of catalyst to a solution of substrate, a compound of general formula I. Alternatively a solution of substrate can be added to a solution of catalyst. Base may be pre-added to the catalyst solution and/or the substrate solution, or can be added later. The hydrogen donor if not already present in the catalyst solution may be added to the substrate solution, or may be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The imine and iminium salt compounds of formula (1) can generally be obtained by known literature methods. Iminium salts, for example, can be prepared by the quaternisation of imines, such as by treatment of imines with alkylating agents.<br>
N-phosphinyl imines can be synthesised from N-hydroxy imines by treatment with a halophosphine. N-Hydroxy imines being readily available from the corresponding aldehyde or ketone by treatment with hydroxylamine. A similar approach can be used for the synthesis of certain N-sulphonylimines whereby N-hydroxy imines are treated with a halosulphoxyl compound in the presence of a base<br>
Alternatively, N-phosphinyl imines can be synthesised from aldehydes or ketones by treatment with phosphinic amides in the presence of a condensation reagent, such as titanium tetrachloride, and a base.<br>
Many of the N-phosphinyl, N-sulphonyl, N-sulphoxy! and N-carboxy imines can be synthesised from aldehydes or ketones by treatment with the corresponding phosphinamide, sulphonamide, sulphoxamide or carboxamides under dehydrating conditions, such azeotropic water removal, often carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as p-toluene sulphonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or a Lewis acid catalyst, treatments with molar equivalents or excesses of drying agents, for example molecular sieves or magnesium sulphate, or treatments with combined lewis acid and dehydrating agents such as titanium tetrachloride or titanium tetraisopropoxide.<br>
N-Carboxy and N-sulphoxyl imines may also be prepared by reaction of ketones with aza Wittig reagents.<br>
N-Sulphoxyl imines may also be prepared by the reaction of a organometallic derivatives of imines, such as an N-lithiated imine, with chiral sulphoxides such as menthyi p-toluene sulphinate.<br>
18<br><br>
N-Silylimines can be prepared form organometallic derivative of sitazanes such as lithium di(trimethyl)silazamide, and ketones, or by the reaction of organometallic derivatives of imines, such as an N-lithiated imine, with a halosilane.<br>
Furthermore, either by in situ cleavage of the R3 or R4 groups of the amines produced by the process of first aspect of present invention under the process conditions, or by further treatment by for example acid or base hydrolysis, a ready route to primary and secondary amines can be accessed.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the production of primary or secondary amines<br>

To a stirred solution of acetonapthone oxime and triethyiamine in diethyl ether/dichloromethane (1/1:10ml) was added dropwise a solution of chlorodiethylphosphine in dichloromethane (2 ml) at -45°C. After addition, the temperature (-45°C) was maintained for 1 hour and then was allowed to slowly rise to reach room temperature without removing the ice bath (dry ice-acetone). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solution was then filtered to remove the triethyiamine   hydrochloride   precipitate   and   washed   with   a    mixture   of   diethyl<br><br>
ether/dichloromethane (1/1). The product was obtained as a brown oil in 85% yield after concentration. No further purification was made.<br>

Notes: ** purchased from The Aldrich Chemical Co.<br>
Prior to the reaction, all solvents were degassed, for example: 10ml of anhydrous methanol was added by syringe to a sealed clean dry round bottomed flask and degassed; either by reducing the pressure until the solvent began to boil and backfilling with nitrogen 3 times, or by bubbling nitrogen through the solution for at least 20 mins.<br>
To a Schlenk flask was added the (R,R)-N-tosyl-1,2-diamino-1,2-diphenylethane, rhodium pentamethylcyclopentadienyl dichloride dimer, N-diphenylphosphinyl-1,1-methylnaphthyl imine and methanol. The flask was stoppered with a "Suba-seal" (RTM). Its contents were evacuated, then purged at room temperature by 3 changes of nitrogen. To the yellow/orange solution was added the formic acid/triethylamine mixture dropwise. After 30 mins, the solution had changed colour to red/brown. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours while being purged with nitrogen, the reaction was then quenched by the addition of saturated sodium carbonate solution (1 ml). The aqueous solution was then shaken with dichloromethane (5 ml), the organic phase separated and collected. The organic phase was then dried by contacting with solid anhydrous magnesium sulphate and then filtering<br><br><br>
