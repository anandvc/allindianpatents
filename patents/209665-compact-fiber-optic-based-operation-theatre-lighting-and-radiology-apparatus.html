COMPACT HBER-OPnC BASED<br>
OPERATION THEATRE LIGHTING WITH RADIOLOGY<br>
APPARATUS DESCRIPTION<br>
The     invention   relates   to  the   compact  fiber-optic  based<br>
operation theatre lighting   with    radiology apparatus ,      For the<br>
purposes of promoting an tinderstanding of the principles of the<br>
inventioiv reference has been made to the favOT^ed epittiet illustrated<br>
in the drawings, and specific language has been used to portray<br>
these embodiments.      However, no restraint on the scope of the<br>
invention is intended by ttiis specific language, and the invention<br>
shotdd be construed to encompass all by^vords that would normally<br>
occur to one of ordinary skill in the art..    Up until now, it has been<br>
common practice to use operating lamps that are suspended from<br>
the ceiling or are designed as projecting wall fittings or a form of<br>
standard lamp, and w^hich, through manued or remote control, can be<br>
directed at a desired working area and to use the C-arm reidiology<br>
apparatus separately as another apparatus which is placed on the<br>
floor of the operation theatre movable by rotatable wheels and<br>
occupies a considerable floor space.     A major short-coming of this<br>
is    that    they    constitute    an    impediment    to the work of the<br>
operating personnel ^vith restriction of the floor space.       The<br>
endeavor of the present invention is to avoid the inadeqixacy of<br>
previously known lighting systems and the C-surm radiok&gt;gic device*<br><br>
The personification of this invention is the txniqueness of the lighting principle utilizing fiber-optic principles. Further, the invention aims to provide a lighting system that automatically focuses the light on the site of the operation devoid of manual operation of the lig^t sources, and which tnay readily be adjusted with regard to light intensity.<br>
The invention compact fiber-optic based operation theatre lighting and radiology apparatus [FIG 8] relates to and consists of roof-mounted dual C-arms, rotatable in all orthogonal XV &amp; Z axes X FIG 1 and with one C-arm accommodating a fiber-optic cable based operation light emitting source the arms of which, are retractable and protractible, in order to facilitate automatic focus of light at the desired point of interest for optimum quantum and extent of illumination FIG 4 - (16,17,18, 19) dtiring any operative procedure. The other C-eirm is fitted with a radiologic device vnth one arm of the C-arm emitting X-radiation in a fan-shaped manner and the other arm of the s£ime C-arm acting as an image receiver with the output signals of the receiver of the radiation being connected to a video unit via a transmission network FIG 3 (7, 8), the w^hole apparahis being able to be brought down up to groiind level intended to interact with an object placed on the operation table to facilitate acquiring static and mobile X-radiation images during an<br><br>
operative procedtires and to perform therapeutic maneuvers like operations needing X-ray control FIG 8 (3, 4)<br>
The apparatus has an elite contrivance consisting of a roof mountable verticsd metallic rod suspender 4 placed on railings on the roof [2, 3] so £LS to move it in eill the orthogonal X,Y and ttie Z axes along the horizontal plane[12]. This maneuver helps the movement of the whole apparatus in any desired direction depending on the position of the patient and the prerequisite of the light or the x-ray screening from the radiology apparatus. This roof mountable vertical xnetaUic rod suspender is also rotatable by 360degrees in the vertical axis [13] and can £ilso be protracted and retracted [14]. A circular knob with grooved pointed projections [5] is fastened to the distal end of the vertical metallic rod suspender, premeditated to provide movements in any preferred direction specially ciciunductory motions and also in all the orthogonal planes which is an ixnconditional inevitability for mechanisms utilizing the C-arm type of gadgetry [15]. All the movements and ttie maneuvers are controlled by the use of an automated remote controlled device.<br>
This exemplary embodiment apparatus comprises of two principle component C-shaped meteiUic structures called C-arms [6,9]. The arrangement of the two C-arms are such that they are fixed at the<br><br>
center point of the "Of' of each C-arm and arranged one on the outer circumference sind the oth^r on the inner circumference and motuited on the roof of the operation theater [1] through the circidar knob with grooved extensions [5] over the operation table [2] for purposes of convenience eind proper space utilization. This dual C-arm helps in illumination [23] for any operative procedure and concurrCTit intra-operative use of X-radiation investigation [20]. The apparatus is compact with tuiique dual role of providing optimum liglht source and illumination in operation theater for the purpose of any surgical operation or procediu^ and for the procurement of static x-radiation images and/or live screening of body images using x-radiation in investigative^ diagnostic methodology and also for therapeutic operative procedures requiring use of intra-operative x-radiation [FIG 3]<br>
The outer C-arm carrying X-ray source/ deiUDted as C-arm-R [6] and the inner C-arm holding light sotu-ce denoted as C-arm-L [9] can be angularly revolved without restraint in the vertical and horizontal axes exclusive of any impediment or obstruction with the other by the use of an adjustment device that adjusts the C-arm in the horizontal axis and the vertical axis w^ithin the plane of the C-arm [13, 15, 16]. The use of the C-arms independentiy in aU the orthogonal planes gmd in-between each other of the C-arms freely<br><br>
without any hindr£mce to each other is necessary to so as to be able to be utilizable simultaneously [HGS 3, 8]<br>
The X-ray device is mounted on one of the arms of outer C-arm-R which is positioned in such a manner that the emitting rays have a focal point iso-centre producing a central x-ray beaxn and the other arm of the C-arm being a radiological image receiver and the object being placed in the centre of the two arms of the C-arm [7, 8, 21, 22 and FIG 3]. The movement of the C-arm is governed l^ a horizontal adjustment device that horizontally adjusts the C-arm which enables an adjustment of the C-arm within a plane of the C-arm and a verticed adjiistment device that vertically adjusts the C-arm witii the devices being configured such that they can automatically move the central x-ray beam of the x-ray source back into a common isocenter, given an orbital rotation of the C-arm with an electronic control fashioned as a computer with characteristic storage comprising values related to horizontal and a vertical compensation movement/ compensation being made dependent on a cheinge of a rotation angle of the C-arm,<br>
Usage of the C-arm begins with positioning the x-ray soiuxre for producing ti\e x-ray beam at an isocenter within the C-arm; and orbitally rotating title C-arm dtiring an examination of the x-ray<br><br>
source and simultaneously adjusting at least one of a horizontal adjustment device and a vertical adjustment device of the C-arm; storing characteristics in a characteristic storage comprising values related to a horizontal £ind a vertical compensation movement; accessing the values related to the horizontal and vertical compensation movement with an electronic control and automatically making the adjustments with the electronic control dependent on a change of a rotation angle [FIG 3]<br>
The central part of this C-arm is attached to another C-arm lying on the internal circumference which is custom-made to carry the light soiu-ce pFIG 4]. The tw^o arms of the C-arm-L carrying the light source is totally retractable and protractible in order to facilitate proper lighting adjustment and to av^rt obstruction [9,10, 18,19]<br>
The lighting system has a complicated construction [FIG 5] as it contains tiie entire objective optical eissembly £ind comprise a dome shaped, sealed, encapsulated optical assembly unit [11] comprised of maiterials, w^hich withstand a temperature of at least about 650 degree C having internal moveable parts combined with a focusing assembly unit designed to perform as an integral element to overcome ergonomic deficiencies found in any of the previous operation theatre Ug^hting systems with or with-out any fiber-optic<br><br>
beise by allowing the shift of the \^rhole lig^t source with the covering dome transportable with the help of railed paling on the inner aspect of the C-arai-R [FIG 8]. The typical focusing mechanism is disclosed with whole conical shaped dome of the lighting S3rstem encompassing several unique structures including a single rotatable, flexible large bundle of 33 fiber-optic cables 25 in tinison emanating from the apex of the cone powered by an external halogen light soiu:ce[24] in connection to a pow^er soiurce. The distal end of the light guiding fiber optic cable element group disperses into its individual components [26] and is affixed On to a plate called the light plate with 33 holes designed specifically to hold on to the optic fiber cable groups [27 and FIG 6]. This tight plate houses a focus control mechanism and by adjusting the distance between objective lens assembly is rotatable in the axial plane in the dome itself through the help of redled ball-bearings and also in the vertical axis of the dome to facilitate adjustment of the light focus and intensity. The objective lens assembly unit [29] is the integrsil part of the light apparatus and has a pltiraUty of movement and can be manipulated to move automatically by remote controlled device in the vertical axis of the dome to aid in the key movements of the focus control mechanism in response to rotation of light plate placed strategically in the annular space and aligned in iso-planar or co-pkmar relationship suremged behind the objective aperture [28] capable of<br><br>
varying the diameters to regulate the intensity of the light and envisage accurate focusing of the light along with a crystsd filter associated w^ith the lens apparatus* The outer circiunference of the lighting equipment is covered by a gjiass case. The whole dome can be moved along the railed paling on ttxe inner aspect of the C-arm-L, and also extendible on to the projection that can be protruded from either end of the C of the C-arm vmtil the tip.<br>
METHOD OF EMPLOYING THE INVENTION (FIG 8)<br>
The invention compact fiber-optic based operation theatre lighting and radiology apparatus relates to and consists of roof-mounted dual C-arms 1 and Z, rotatable in all orthogonal X,Y &amp; Z £ixes and with one C-arm accommodating a fiber-optic cable beised operation light emitting sotirce [9]. Both the anns of the C-arm with the light source, are retractable and protractible [10], in order to facilitate automatic focus of light at the desired point of interest for optimiim quantum and extent of illununation during any operative procedure. The other C-arm is fitted with a radiologic device with one arm of the C-arm 6 emitting X-radiation [6, 7] in a fan-shaped manner [20] and the other arm of the same C-arm acting as an image receiver [8] with the output signals of the receiver of the radiatic^i being connected to a video iinit via a transmission network, the whole apparatus being able to be brought dowi\ up to ground level<br><br>
[4] intended to intereu:t with an object [22] placed on the operation table [21] to facilitate acquiring static and mobile X-radiation images during an operative procedures and to perform therapeutic maneuvers like operations needing X-ray control*<br>
The patient [22] is reclined on the operation theatre table in the supine, prone, later£d, semi-lateral, trendelenberg^ anti-trendelenberg^ sitting, renal, lithotomy, knee-chest, jack-knife, Concorde position or any desired position depending on the stargical procedture to be performed. The mains of the apparatus is switched on. Thereafter, the complete operation maneuvers of the apparatus is carried out ixsing remote control facility. Depending on the surgical procedure plaiuied, the light is focused at tiie desired point of interest in the preferred angulation with the ideal intensity either on the head, neck, chest, back, abdomen, pelvis, legs or upper limbs in an ideal way preventing any hindrance to the unobtrusive viewing of the operative field. In order to get an acciirate focus on the region of interest the remote is used to either bring down the whole light apparatus up to the operation field by elongating the vertical metallic rod [10,19]. To get the rigiht angulation the arms of either of the C-arm*L is protruded eind the whole cone shaped light system brought down along the arms of the C-arm-L. Further accurate focusing is performed by adjusting the light intensity  [25,  27],<br><br>
aperture diameter [28, 31, 32], and axially moving the lens system [29] in the orthogonal planes in which it is desired to move. Very small or inaccessible p€u*ts of the body viz., oral cavity, maxilla, back of the neck, ear and nose, pelvic region for g3aiecologLcal operations and ecnal regions, for general surgic2il operations etc., the light may be adjusted automatically and focused with pin point focus without any dispersion problems akin to the laser beam with parallel rays at specific pcrint of interest with any desired maximiun iUiimination intensity. The lig|ht being of the halogen variety precludes the use of the white baUmcing that is required for pin-point focusing and iUvimination.<br>
For procedures requiring diagnostic or therapeutic X-ray screening or procedures, the C-arm-Rmaybe brought over the patient lying on tiie or table and can be placed an3rvN^here using the maneuverability in any orthogonal plane extending from head to toe [FIG 8], to screen the patient or obtain X-ray images for diagnosis or therapeutic procedures. The C-Arm-R znay be placed either in the transverse axis of the patient's body or vertical axis of tiie patient's body so that images are obtained from any part preferred. Fxirther operationally the mechanism that determines, before £in automatic execution of a compensation movement, a limit of an adjxistment range of the C-arm, dependent on a change of a<br><br>
rotation angle, a vertical position and a horizontal position of the C-£irm providing an isocentric central x-ray beam of an x-ray source passing while rotating and simultaneously adjusting at least one of a horizontal adjustment device eind a vertical adjustment device of ttve C-arm so that the x-ray beam is moved to or stays at the isocenter and later stoiing values related to a horizontal and a vertical compensation movement. Circuitry for 2icquiring image data and for transforming the data into a useable form is done with the aid of the computer/ which is then processed to create a reconstructed image of features of interest within the patient*<br>
The novelty of the invention is due to the dual feature of a light source and €in X-ray apparatus/ combined in as a single apparatus with roof-mountable features and no floor space occupancy. The apparatvis has concurrent utilization of the C-arms for light and X-rays with novel utilization of fiber-optic based principles in m^or OT lig^tS/ hitherto exploited only in endoscopes. Fiirther/ the lens-systenv co-planar aperture system./ single light source witii multiple fiber-optic cables attaching to a light plate to enhance the iUiuxiinating capacity utilizing minimal electric power with the option of using single or mxiltiple entry points for the light plate, depending on requirement with accurate focusing is the key feature. Completely automated/ without requiring the surgeon or<br><br>
other faculty for assisting surgeries to personally handle the apparatus thereby niaintaining strict asepsis since it can be operated by using a reniote is anotitier supplementary appealing feature*<br><br>

movement, compensation being made dependent on a chsmge of a rotation angle of the C-arm and with the object being placed in the centre of the two arms of the C-arm.<br>
6. The apparatus as claimed in Oaim-4&amp;5 with the centr£d p£irt of this C-arm-R attached to another C-arm-L lying along the intemgd drctimference whose arms are retractable and protractible which is custon\*made to carry the light source.<br>
7. The apparatus as claimed in Claim-4,5&amp;6 comprising of the lighting system comprising of a dome shaped, sealed, encapsiilated opticsd assembly unit comprised of materials, able to w^ithstand ten\perature upto 650degreeC assembled with a focxising xinit allowing the shift of the whole light source with the covering dome transportable with the help of railed paling on the inner eispect of the Oarm-R.<br>
8. The apparatus as claimed in Claim-7, encompassing a power source in connection to an external halogen light supply with the typical light focusing mechanism in arrangement with several tinique structures like a single, rotatable, flexible, large bundle of a union of 33 fiber-optic cables emanating from the apex of the cone whose distal end disperses into its individual<br><br>
components and gets affixed on to a plate called the lig^t plate with 33 holes made specifically to hold on to the optic fiber cable groups.<br>
9. The apparatus as claimed in Cl2dm-7&amp;8, housing the Ught plate controls a focus mechanisxn by adjusting the distance between an objective lens eissembly rotatable in the axial plane in the dome itself making use of the railed ballbearings and also in the verticsd axis of the dome to facilitate adjustment of the light focus and intensity,<br>
10. The apparatus as claimed in Claim-7,8&amp;9, with the objective lens assembly unit being the integral part of the Ught apparatus having plurality of movement manipulatable automatically by remote contcplled device in the vertical axis of the dome to aid in the key movements of the focus control mechanism in response to rotation of light plate placed strategically in the annular space and aligned in iso-planar or co-planar relationship behind the objective aperture.<br>
11.    The apparatus   as   claimed   in   Claim-7,8,9&amp;10, with an objective aperture covered on the outer surface by a g^lass case<br><br>
wfiose circumference and diameter can be varied automatically by remote control to regulate the intensity of the light and envisage accurate focusing of the light along with a crystal filter associated with the lens apparatus.<br>
12.	The apparatus as claimed in Claim-6,7,8,9,10 &amp;11, with<br>
the whole dome moveable along the railed paling on the inner<br>
aspect of the C-arm-L £ind also extendible on to the projection<br>
that can be protruded from either end of the C of the C-arm<br>
until the tip.<br>
13.	The apparatus/ substantially consists as herein<br>
described as claimed in Claim 1-12 with respect to the<br>
