				<td>MEDICAL DEVICE PACKAGE, KIT AND ASSOCIATED METHODS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] 1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates, in general, to medical device packages and. in<br>
particular, to medical device packages for receiving, and securely and removably<br>
retaining, a medical device.<br>
[0003] 2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0004] A variety of medical devices require packaging to. for example, protect the<br>
medical device from damage prior to use and to maintain sterility of the medical device.<br>
For integrated medical devices that combine a dermal tissue penetration member (e.g., a<br>
lancet or micro-needle) with a test strip, the associated package should provide for an<br>
uncomplicated deployment of the dermal tissue penetration member during use. while<br>
also providing for protection of a user from inadvertent contact with the dermal tissue<br>
penetration member prior and subsequent to use. Furthermore, the packaging should<br>
provide humidity resistance for the test strip during storage.<br>
[0005] Single-use (i.e., disposable) integrated medical devices are illustrative of the<br>
above requirements in that they require a medical device package that maintains<br>
sterility and protects the single-use integrated medical device contained therein from<br>
damage prior to use. Such medical device packages should also provide humidity<br>
resistance and UV protection for a test strip of such single-use integrated medical<br>
devices prior to use. Furthermore, the medical device package should provide for<br>
deployment of a dermal tissue penetration member of such a single-use integrated<br>
medical device during use. as well as for disabling (i.e.. preventing subsequent use) and<br>
safely discarding the single-use integrated medical device following use.<br>
[0006] Conventional medical device packages do not fulfill all or even most of the<br>
requirements described above in a cost effective manner. Still needed in the field.<br>
therefore, is a medical device package that provides a sterility barrier and/or for<br>
protection of a medical device enclosed therein, while also providing for an<br>
uncomplicated deployment of the medical device during use. Furthermore, for<br>
integrated medical devices that include a dermal tissue penetration member (e.g.. a<br>
lancet or micro-needle), a need exists for a medical device package that protects the<br>
dermal tissue penetration member from damage, humidity, and/or contamination prior<br>
to use, that protects a user from accidental contact therewith and that also disables the<br>
medical device following use, thereby preventing its repeated use. In addition, the<br>
materials and methods used to manufacture the medical device package should be cost<br>
effective.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Medical device packages according to the present invention provide a sterility<br>
barrier and/or protection for a medical device (e.g., an integrated medical device)<br>
enclosed therein. Embodiments of medical device packages according to the present<br>
invention also provide for an uncomplicated deployment of the medical device during<br>
use. Furthermore, with respect to integrated medical devices that include a dermal<br>
tissue penetration member (e.g., a lancet or micro-needle), medical device packages<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention protect the dermal tissue penetration<br>
member from damage, humidity, and/or contamination prior to use, and protect a user<br>
from accidental contact therewith. Embodiments of the medical device packages<br>
according to the present invention are also adapted to disable the medical device<br>
following use, thereby preventing its repeated use. In addition, due to relative<br>
simplicity of configuration, medical device packages according to the present invention<br>
are cost effective.<br>
[0008] A medical device package according to embodiments of the present invention<br>
includes a main cap member and a minor cap member. The main cap member has a<br>
proximal end, a distal end and a cavity with a cavity opening at the proximal end. The<br>
cavity is configured to receive, and to securely and removably retain, a medical device<br>
(e.g.. an integrated medical device that includes a dermal tissue penetration member<br>
and a test strip) at least partially therein. The minor cap member is configured to seal<br>
the cavity opening once the medical device has been received in the cavity.<br>
[0009] Medical device package kits according to embodiments of the present invention<br>
include a main cap member, a minor cap member and a connector. The main cap<br>
member has a proximal end, a distal end and a cavity. The cavity has a cavity opening<br>
at the proximal end of the main cap member. The cavity is configured to receive, and<br>
to securely and removably retain, a medical device at least partially therein. The minor<br>
cap member is configured to seal the cavity opening once the medical device has been<br>
received in the cavity. The connector is configured to engage the medical device<br>
during removal of the medical device from the cavity.<br>
[0010] Methods according to the present invention enable the uncomplicated<br>
deployment (i.e., extraction) of a medical device from a medical device package.<br>
Methods for extracting a medical device from a medical device package according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention first include providing a medical device package,<br>
with a medical device (e.g., an integrated medical device) therein, and a connector.<br>
The provided medical device package includes a main cap member having a cavity and<br>
proximal and distal ends, and a minor cap member. The cavity of the main cap<br>
member has a cavity opening at the proximal end of the main cap member and is<br>
configured to receive, and to securely and removably retain, the medical device at least<br>
partially therein. The minor cap member is configured to seal the cavity opening.<br>
[0011] The methods also include breaching the minor cap member with the connector<br>
such that at least a portion of the connector enters the cavity. Next, the medical device<br>
is engaged by the connector and extracted from the medical device package.<br>
[0012] Other methods according to the present invention include disabling a medical<br>
device that has been extracted from a medical device package by inserting the medical<br>
device back into a cavity of the medical device package to a position that results in a<br>
disabling of repeated use of the medical device. Such disablement can be obtained by,<br>
for example, a wedging of the medical device into a fixed position within the cavity of<br>
the medical device package.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0042] FIGs. 1. 2A-2D, 3A and 3B are various simplified views of a medical device<br>
package 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Medical<br>
device package 100 includes a main cap member 110 and a minor cap member 150.<br>
[0043] Main cap member 110 includes a cavity 116 therein, a proximal end 112 and a<br>
distal end 114. Cavity 116 has a cavity opening 118 at the proximal end 112 of the<br>
main cap member 110 and is configured to receive, and to securely and removably<br>
retain, a medical device (e.g., integrated medical device 300, illustrated in FIGs. 4A<br>
and 4B), at least partially therein.<br>
[0044] FIGs. 4A and 4B are simplified perspective and side views, respectively, of an<br>
exemplary integrated medical device 300 that can be securely and removably contained<br>
within medical device package 100. Integrated medical device 300 includes a test strip<br>
304 and a dermal tissue penetration member 302, as illustrated in FIGs. 4A-4B. Test<br>
strip 304 has a reaction area (not shown) and electrical contacts 306 that terminate on a<br>
distal end 310 of medical device 300. Electrical contacts 306 are made of any suitable<br>
conductive material, such as carbon. Dermal tissue penetration member 302 includes a<br>
lancet 320 adapted to pierce a user's skin and draw blood into the reaction area of test<br>
strip 304. Further descriptions of integrated medical devices that can be contained<br>
within embodiments of medical device packages according to the present invention are<br>
in International Application No. PCT/GBO 1/05634 (published as WO 02/49507 on June<br>
27, 2002) and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/143,399, both of which are fully<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In addition, dermal tissue penetration member 302<br>
can be fabricated, for example, by a progressive die-stamping technique, as disclosed in<br>
the aforementioned International Application No. PCT/GBO 1/05634 (published as WO<br>
02/49507 on June 27, 2002) and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/143.399.<br>
[0045] Referring again to FIGs. 1, 2A-2D, 3A and 3B, in the embodiment of medical<br>
device package 100, cavity opening 118 is bounded by a rim 120 of sufficient surface<br>
area to enable minor cap member 150 to be adhered to rim 120 by processes known to<br>
those skilled in the art. including, but not limited to, heat sealing processes. In this<br>
manner, minor cap member 150 and main cap member 110 of medical device package<br>
100 provide a sterility barrier and humidity protection for a medical device contained<br>
therein.<br>
[0046] External features of main cap member 110 include a first peripheral edge 122, a<br>
second peripheral edge 124, a main cap upper surface 126 and a main cap lower surface<br>
128. As shown in FIG. 2A, first peripheral edge 122 and second peripheral edge 124<br>
are truncated to end at the distal edge 121 of rim 120. If desired, the first and second<br>
peripheral edges 122, 124 can be asymmetrically disposed about a longitudinal axis of<br>
the main cap member. Such an asymmetric configuration can serve to properly orient<br>
the medical device package during its insertion into a receiving slot of associated<br>
hardware (for example, an analytical meter receiving slot configured to direct the<br>
medical device package to a connector described below with respect to FIGs. 6A-6D).<br>
[0047] As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2A, main cap upper surface 126 optionally includes a<br>
directional marker 130 that is discontinuous with (e.g., raised above or, alternatively,<br>
recessed below) the remainder of main cap upper surface 126. Directional marker 130<br>
may include, but is not limited to, an ellipse 132 and an arrow 134. as depicted in FIGs.<br>
1 and 2A. Directional marker 130 provides a user with both tactile and visual cues for<br>
proper orientation of medical device package 100 during use.<br>
[0048] Cavity 116 is defined (at least in part) by a first smooth inner surface 127 and a<br>
second smooth inner surface 129 and includes first and second lateral channels 140 and<br>
142, respectively, as shown in FIGs. 2C-2D and 3B. In addition, cavity 116 is also<br>
defined by first lateral surface 170 located internally to first peripheral edge 122 and a<br>
second lateral surface 172 located internally to second peripheral edge 124. In the<br>
vicinity of proximal end 112, first lateral surface 170 has a first sloped land 160. and<br>
second lateral surface 172 has a second sloped land 162. First sloped land 160<br>
terminates at the beginning of first lateral channel 140, while second sloped land 162<br>
terminates at the beginning of second lateral channel 142. First lateral channel 140 and<br>
second lateral channel 142 extend about half way along first and second laterals<br>
surfaces 170 and 172, respectively. First and second sloped lands 160, 162 begin at<br>
cavity opening 118, and slope inwardly and distally towards distal end 114 of main cap<br>
member 110.<br>
[0049] First and second lateral channels 140 and 142 "begin at the end of first and<br>
second sloped lands 160 and 162. respectively, and extend approximately half way into<br>
cavity 116. First and second lateral channels 140 and 142 are divided into a post-use<br>
portion 202, a transition point 204, and a pre-use portion 206 (see FIGs. 3A and 3B).<br>
As is evident from FIG. 3B, first lateral channel 140 is the mirror image of second<br>
lateral channel 142. One skilled in the art will recognize from the entirety of the<br>
present disclosure that first and second sloped lands 160, 162, first and second lateral<br>
channels 140, 142, transition point 204, and pre-use portion 206 are configured to<br>
receive, and securely and removably retain, a medical device within cavity 116. In<br>
addition, post-use portion 202 is configured to disable a used medical device (as<br>
explained in detail below with respect to, for example, FIGs. 16A and 16B).<br>
[0050] Main cap member 110 can be formed of any suitable material known to those of<br>
skill in the art including, for example, rigid plastic materials such as polystyrene,<br>
polycarbonate and polyester. Such rigid plastic materials are impervious to puncturing<br>
and to air and/or air-borne bacteria and, therefore, provide a sterility barrier and a<br>
puncture-resistant protective barrier. It can be particularly beneficial in terms of<br>
humidity protection for main cap member 110 to be formed of a desiccant-loaded high-<br>
density polyethylene (e.g., 2AP desiccant-loaded high-density polyethylene,<br>
commercially available from Airsec in France).<br>
[0051] Minor cap member 150 is configured to seal cavity opening 118 once a medical<br>
device has been received in cavity 116. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, minor cap<br>
member 150 is a breachable film such as breachable metallic foil. Other suitable<br>
materials for minor cap member 150 include paper, polymer and Tyvek. However, as<br>
described with respect to other embodiments below, minor cap member 150 can take a<br>
variety of forms, all of which are capable of sealing the cavity opening of an associated<br>
main cap member once a medical device has been at least partially received within the<br>
cavity of the main cap member.<br>
[0052] FIG. 2D is a proximal end perspective view of main cap member 110.<br>
Transition point 204 includes a vertical shoulder 204A and a horizontal shoulder 204B,<br>
as shown in FIG. 2D. Upon insertion of an unused medical device (e.g.. integrated<br>
medical device 300 of FIGs. 4A and 4B prior to use) into cavity 116 of main cap<br>
member 110, vertical shoulder 204A prevents the medical device (not shown) from<br>
being inserting past transition point 204 (see FIGS. 2A and 2B). In other words, the<br>
unused medical device is inserted only to a first position, which is defined by contact of<br>
the unused medical device with transition point 204. However, once a medical device<br>
is used, such a used medical device can be inserted back into cavity 116 of main cap<br>
member 110 for disablement and disposal purposes. In doing so, the used medical<br>
device (e.g., integrated medical device 300 of FIGs. 4A and 4B subsequent to use) is<br>
inserted beyond the first position to a second position, wherein the used medical device<br>
extends past transition point 204 toward distal end 114 and is irreparably damaged (i.e.,<br>
disabled) by horizontal shoulder 204B. Such damage prevents a subsequent removal,<br>
and thus repeated use, of the once used medical device.<br>
[0053] FIGs. 5A-5D are various views of main cap member 100 of FIG. 1 with<br>
integrated medical device 300 of FIGs. 4A and 4B inserted therein prior to use of<br>
integrated medical device 300 (i.e., integrated medical device 300 is "unused"). In<br>
FIGs. 5A-5D, integrated medical device 300 extends between first lateral channel 140<br>
and second lateral channel 142 and lies parallel to first smooth inner surface 127 and<br>
second smooth inner surface 129. Unused integrated medical device 300 is securely<br>
retained within cavity 116 via a friction fit with first lateral channel 140 and second<br>
lateral channel 142. Distal end 310 of integrated medical device 300 remains within<br>
proximal end 112 of medical device package 100 and is not in contact with first lateral<br>
channel 140 and second lateral channel 142. Furthermore, it should be noted that<br>
lancet 320 is within cavity 116 and thus protected from inadvertent damage. Unused<br>
integrated medical device 300 is positioned within first and second lateral channels 140<br>
and 142 such that proximal end 312 of integrated medical device 300 touches, but goes<br>
no further than, transition point 204, and distal end 310 of integrated medical device<br>
300 remains free from contact with first and second lateral channels 140 and 142 in<br>
cavity 116 (see FIGs. 5C and 5D) of main cap member 110.<br>
[0054] FTGs. 6A through 6D depict an exemplary embodiment of a connector 500<br>
adapted to extract integrated medical device 300 from medical device package 100. In<br>
addition, connector 500 can advantageously be used to mechanically and/or manually<br>
manipulate such a medical device once the medical device has been extracted from the<br>
medical device package. For example, connector 500 can be used to transfer a medical<br>
device from a medical device package to a metering system. As will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art, connector 500 may be a component (either a removable<br>
component or a permanently integrated component) of a metering system (e.g., an<br>
analytical meter configured to determine analyte concentrations in biological fluid<br>
samples). Alternatively, connector 500 can be combined with medical device packages<br>
to form a kit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0055] Connector 500 includes a strip extracting member 502 and a connector body<br>
504. In addition, connector 500 includes a proximal end 510, a distal end 512, an upper<br>
surface 514 and a lower surface 516. Connector body 504 includes a connector<br>
directional marker 518 on upper surface 514. Connector directional marker 518<br>
(optional) is discontinuous with (e.g., raised above or recessed below) upper surface<br>
514 of connector 500. Connector directional marker 5 J 8 may include, but is not<br>
limited to, an ellipse 530 and an arrow 532. Connector directional marker 518 provides<br>
a user with both tactile and visual cues for proper orientation of connector 500 when<br>
inserted into medical device package 100.<br>
[0056] Strip extracting member 502 includes a lower strip engaging arm 540, an upper<br>
strip engaging arm 542 and a plurality of strip engaging elements 544, as illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 6C-6D. Connector 500 also includes electrical leads (not shown) for providing<br>
an electrical connection^) between strip engaging elements 544 and an analytical<br>
meter. In addition, strip extracting member 502 includes a vertical barrier 550 that<br>
contacts distal end 310 of integrated medical device 300 when integrated medical<br>
device 300 is engaged by connector 500. Although three strip engaging elements 544<br>
are depicted in FIG. 6D for the purpose of illustration and explanation, strip extracting<br>
member 502 can include any suitable number of strip-engaging elements. Strip<br>
engaging elements 544 are located on inner surface 543 of upper strip engaging arm<br>
542. Strip engaging elements 544 are spring-loaded connections formed, for example,<br>
by being molded into connector 500 by any suitable process known to those skilled in<br>
the art. Strip engaging elements 544 are used to contact test strip 304 of integrated<br>
medical device 300 through electrical contacts 306. One skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that connector 500 can provide electrical communication between test strip<br><br>
304 and an analytical meter via strip engaging elements 544 and the connector's<br>
electrical leads.<br>
[0057] FIG. 7 is a top view of connector 500 and a proximal end view of main cap<br>
member 110. with dashed vertical lines showing proper alignment of connector 500<br>
during extraction of a medical device. Solids horizontal line 5F-5F indicates width of<br>
the medical device (for example, approximately 5.5 mm), while solid horizontal line<br>
5G-5G indicates the width of strip extracting element 502 (for example, approximately<br>
4.5 mm).<br>
[0058] FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a sequence of steps in a process 800 for<br>
extracting a medical device from a medical device package according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Process 800 is described below utilizing FIGs.<br>
9A-D (schematic, cross-sectional views depicting various stages of process 800). FIGs.<br>
10A-E (schematic, perspective views depicting various stages of process 800). FIGs.<br>
11A-C (schematic, top cross-sectional views of various stages of process 800) and<br>
FIGs. 12A-C (schematic enlargements of portions of FIGs. 11 A-C, respectively).<br>
[0059] Process 800 includes first providing (i) a medical device package with a minor<br>
cap member and a medical device contained therein and (ii) a connector, as set forth in<br>
step 810 of FIG. 8. One skilled in the art will recognize that the provided medical<br>
device package and connector can be any suitable medical device package according to<br>
the present invention that includes a breachable minor cap member (e.g., the medical<br>
device package of FIG. 1 and any suitable connector according to the present<br>
invention. The provision of an exemplary medical device package and connector are<br>
depicted in FIG. 9A and FIG. 10A, wherein like elements of the medical device<br>
package and connector of earlier figures are identified with like numerals.<br>
[0060] Next, as set forth in step 820. the minor cap member is breached (e.g.. ruptured)<br>
with the connector such that at least a portion of the connector has entered into the<br>
cavity of the main cap member (see FIG. 9B, 10B. 11A and 12A). Subsequently, the<br>
medical device is engaged by the connector (see FIGs. 9C, IOC, 1 IB and 12B), as set<br>
forth in step 830. The force required for the connector to engage with the medical<br>
device is, for example, approximately 2N. The connector and engaged medical device<br>
are then extracted from the cavity of the medical device package, as set forth in step<br>
840 (see FIGs. 9D, 10D-10E, 11C and 12C). Each of the steps of process 800 can be<br>
performed, for example, either manually by a user or with the aid of a mechanical<br>
and/or electrical device.<br>
[0061] It should be noted, that beaching the minor cap member (such as a breachable<br>
film) and engaging the medical device with the connector do not result in the medical<br>
device moving past the transition points 204 of the first and second lateral channels<br>
140, 142 (as depicted in FIGs. 12A and 12B, which correspond to the breaching and<br>
engaging steps of process 800) since the force required to move the medical device past<br>
transition points 204 (e.g., 7N) is significantly greater than the force required to engage<br>
the connector with the medical device (e.g.. 2N). In the embodiment of FIGs. 9A-9D,<br>
10A-10E, 11A-11C and 12A-12C, during the engaging step, strip engaging elements of<br>
the connector engage a test strip 304 of integrated medical device 300 and a vertical<br>
barrier of the connector contacts the distal end of the integrated medical device 300.<br>
The force required for the breaching the minor cap member and engagement of the<br>
medical device can be, for example, in the range of about 1.5 N to 2.5 N.<br>
[0062] Solid line 5F-5F of FIG. 10E represents a dimension that is identical to the<br>
dimension of solid horizontal line 5F-5F of FIG. 7 (i.e.. the width of integrated medical<br>
device 300). Solid line 10H-10H in FIG. 10E represents the width of the medical<br>
device's lancet. Solid line 101-101 of FIG. 10E represents the width of cavity opening<br>
of medical device package, which is larger than the dimension represented by solid line<br>
5F-5F to assure a medical device's smooth insertion into, and removal from the cavity.<br>
[0063] Process 800 can be performed manually or automatically. Furthermore, process<br>
800 can be, for example, performed by an integrated device that combines an analytical<br>
meter and a connector in a configuration that provides for (i) a medical device to be<br>
extracted from a medical device package; (ii) a sample (e.g., a whole blood sample) to<br>
be obtained from a user and (iii) an analytical result (e.g., blood glucose concentration<br>
of the whole blood sample) to determined, all by a single operation of the integrated<br>
device. Mechanical motions may be incorporated into a lancet cocking action, new test<br>
strip deployment and/or ejection.<br>
[0064] FIG. 13 is a flow chart illustrating a sequence of steps in a process 1300 for<br>
extracting a medical device from a medical device package for use and subsequently<br>
disabling the medical device after use according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Process 1300 is described below utilizing FIGs. 14A-14D<br>
(schematic, cross-sectional views depicting various stages of process 1300), FIGs. 15A-<br>
15D (schematic, perspective views depicting various stages of process 1300) and FIGs.<br>
16A-16B (schematic, top cross-sectional views of a stage of process 1300).<br>
[0065] Process 1300 includes first providing (i) a medical device package with a minor<br>
cap member and a medical device contained therein at a first position and (ii) a<br>
connector, as set forth in step 1310 of FIG. 13. One skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that the provided medical device package and connector can be any medical device<br>
package according to the present invention that includes a breachable minor cap<br>
member (e.g., the medical device package of FIG. 1).<br>
[0066] Next, at step 1320. the minor cap member is breached (e.g., ruptured) with the<br>
connector such that at least a portion of the connector has entered the cavity of the main<br>
cap member. The medical device is then engaged by the connector, as set forth in step<br>
1330. The connector and engaged medical device are then extracted from the cavity of<br>
the medical device package for use. as set forth in step 1340.<br>
[0067] Subsequently, at step 1350, the connector and engaged medical device are<br>
inserted back into a cavity of the medical device package to a second position, whereby<br>
the medical device is disabled from reuse (see FIGs. 14A-14C, 15A-15C and 16A-<br>
16B). The connector is then disengaged from the medical device and withdrawn from<br><br>
the medical device package, as set forth in step 1360. It is envisioned that during step<br>
1350, the medical device is disabled by virtue of the medical device being wedged into<br>
the cavity such that the force required to remove the medical device from the cavity is<br>
greater than the force required to disengage the connector from the medical device.<br>
Therefore, an attempt to re-extract the medical device with the connector would be<br>
unsuccessful since the connector would become disengaged from the medical device<br>
before sufficient force could be applied to extract the wedged medical device.<br>
[0068] It should be noted that during insertion of the connector and engaged medical<br>
device into the cavity at step 1350, the medical device is inserted to a second position<br>
within post-use portion 202 that is beyond transition points 204 of the first and second<br>
lateral channels (see, in particular, FIG. 16B), i.e., beyond the first position. The force<br>
required to insert the medical device into the medical device package and disable the<br>
medical device is, for example, approximately 7N. As noted above, disablement of the<br>
medical device is a result of the medical device being wedged into the cavity such that<br>
it cannot be re-extracted using the connector.<br>
[0069] FIG. 17 depicts a medical device package 1900 according to another exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 17, dashed lines indicate certain features<br>
that are hidden due to the perspective nature of FIG. 17. In addition, FIG. 17 depicts<br>
the circumstance where a medical device (i.e., integrated medical device 300 of FIGs.<br>
4A and 4B) is retained partially within medical device package 1900. In the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 17, electrical contacts 306 project from the cavity opening and<br>
minor cap member. Since electrical contacts 306 project from both the cavity opening<br>
and the minor cap member, engagement of the electrical contacts with a connector can<br>
be simplified. For example, there is no need to breach or otherwise remove any<br>
component of the medical device package to obtain access to the electrical contacts and<br>
the electrical contacts are free to deflect upon engagement with a connector.<br>
[0070] Medical device package 1900 includes a main cap member 1910 with a<br>
proximal end 1912, a distal end 1914, a cavity 1918 and a cavity opening 1916. Distal<br><br>
end 1914 is configured to function as a handle during manually removal of medical<br>
device package 1900 from secondary packaging (not illustrated).<br>
[0071] Medical device package 1900 can be constructed, for example, of molded<br>
plastic or other material that is impervious to air and/or air-borne bacteria, to provide a<br>
sterile-protective and puncture-resistant barrier. Suitable materials include, but are not<br>
limited to. polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyester.<br>
[0072] Cavity 1918 of medical device package 1900 is defined by surfaces depicted<br>
with dashed lines in FIG. 17. Cavity opening 1916 is configured to provide for the<br>
placement of dermal tissue penetration member 302 of medical device 300 wholly<br>
within cavity 1918, as shown in FIG. 17. Medical device package 1900 includes<br>
internally disposed ribs I960, located distally to cavity opening 1916. Ribs 1960 serve<br>
to seal cavity 1918 once a medical device has been inserted partially therein, and<br>
provide a sterile and protective barrier for dermal tissue penetration member 302 by<br>
creating a tortuous path between the external environment and the cavity of the medical<br>
device package. Ribs 1960, together with an at least partially inserted medical device,<br>
serve as a minor cap member for medical device package 1900. As an alternative to<br>
ribs 1960, elastomeric o-rings could be employed to seal cavity 1918 once a medical<br>
device has been inserted partially therein, and to provide a sterile and protective barrier<br>
for dermal tissue penetration member 302.<br>
[0073] FIG. 18 is an exploded perspective view of a medical device package 2000<br>
according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention containing a<br>
medical device 300 (as depicted in FIGs. 4A and 4B). Medical device package 2000<br>
includes a main cap member 2010 and a minor cap member 2020. Main cap member<br>
2010 has a proximal end 2012, a distal end 2014, a cavity opening (not shown), and a<br>
cavity (also not shown). The cavity and cavity opening of main cap member 2010 are<br>
configured for placement of a dermal tissue penetration member of an integrated<br>
medical device wholly therein, thus providing a protective barrier for such a dermal<br>
tissue penetration member.<br><br>
[0074] Minor cap member 2020 has a proximal end 2022. a distal end 2024, a minor<br>
cap opening 2026, and a minor cap cavity (not shown in FIG. 18). Minor cap opening<br>
2026 and the minor cap cavity are configured for the placement of a test strip 304 of an<br>
integrated medical device wholly or partially therein. Furthermore, proximal end 2012<br>
of main cap member 2010 is adapted to fit wholly within minor cap opening 2026 and<br>
the minor cap cavity. Once main cap member 2010 is fit within minor cap opening<br>
2026 and the minor cap cavity, integrated medical device 300 is completely enclosed<br>
and provided with a sterile-protective and moisture-free barrier.<br>
[0075] Both main cap member 2010 and minor cap member 2020 are beneficially<br>
constructed of molded plastic or other rigid material that is impervious to air and/or air-<br>
borne bacteria, to provide a sterile-protective and puncture-resistant barrier. Suitable<br>
materials for main cap member 2010 and minor cap member 2020 include, but are not<br>
limited to. polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyester.<br>
[0076] FIG. 19 is an exploded perspective view of a medical device package 2100<br>
according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Medical<br>
device package 2100 includes a main cap member 2110 and a minor cap member 2120.<br>
Main cap member 2110 has a proximal end 2112. a distal end 2114, a cavity opening<br>
2116 and a cavity (not shown). Cavity opening 2116 and the cavity of medical device<br>
package 2100 are configured for placement of a dermal tissue penetration member 302<br>
of an integrated medical device and a minor cap member proximal end 2122 (described<br>
below) wholly therein, thus providing a protective barrier for dermal tissue penetration<br>
member 302.<br>
[0077] Minor cap member 2120 of medical device package 2100 has a proximal end<br>
2122 and a distal end 2124. Moreover, integrated medical device 300 is permanently<br>
attached to minor cap member 2120 at proximal end 2122. The permanent attachment<br>
of such an integrated medical device to minor cap member 2120 is envisioned to<br>
provide handling benefits during use of the integrated medical device. For example,<br><br>
minor cap member 2120 could be gripped by a meter, with the main cap member then<br>
being easily removed by a user (e.g., by pulling, twisting or snapping) to deploy the<br>
integrated medical device.<br>
[0078] FIGs. 20, 21 and 22 depict the main cap member 2450 of a medical package<br>
device according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention (for<br>
purposes of clarity, the minor cap member of this medical device package is not<br>
illustrated). FIG. 21 depicts an integrated medical device 300 retained within main cap<br>
member 2450 and FIG. 22 depicts an integrated medical device 300 disabled within<br>
main cap member 2450. Main cap member 2450 is identical to main cap member 110<br>
of FIG. 3B, with the exception that main cap member 2450 has a distal end cavity 2452<br>
configured for disablement and disposal of an integrated medical device.<br>
[0079] Those skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of medical device<br>
packages according to the present invention can be secondarily packaged for single use<br>
in, for example, a vial or cartridge configured for dispensing the medical device<br>
packages. The secondary package may be constructed of material containing desiccant<br>
or may contain separately packaged desiccant for maintaining contents moisture free.<br>
[0080] Once apprised of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will also<br>
recognize that a variety of medical devices can be beneficially employed with<br>
embodiments of medical device packages according to the present invention. Such<br>
medical devices include, but are not limited to. integrated medical devices that include<br>
a combination of a test strip and a lancet, examples of which are described in the<br>
aforementioned International Application No. PCT/GB01/05634 (published as WO<br>
02/49507 on June 27, 2002) and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/143,399, both of which<br>
are fully incorporated herein by reference. One skilled in the art will also recognize<br>
that such test strips may have, but are not limited to, an electrochemical or photometric<br>
configuration. For illustrative purposes only, medical devices in various figures of the<br>
present disclosure were depicted as having an electrochemical configuration.<br><br>
[0081] Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that medical device packages<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention can be employed with medical<br>
device adapted for the measurement of, for example, glucose, ketones. glycated<br>
albumin, coagulation parameters and cholesterol of a sample.<br>
[0082] In addition, one skilled in the art will also recognize that medical device<br>
packages according to the present invention may be contained within a combined<br>
sample collection and metering system designed for in-situ testing. Examples of such<br>
systems designed for in-situ testing are disclosed in International Patent Application<br>
No. PCT/USO1/07169 (published as WO 01/64105 Al on September 7, 2001) and<br>
International Patent Application No. PCT/GB02/03772 (published as WO 03/015627<br>
A1 on February 27. 2003), each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0083] It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the<br>
invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended<br>
that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and<br>
