Mixed herbicidal compositions Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to mixed herbicide compositions for controlling weeds, preferably for controlling weeds in crops of useful plants, for example cereal crops such as rice, wheat, barley, rye, oat, maize, millet and plantation crops, preferably paddy field crops, such as in fields for paddy rice. More particularly, the present invention relates to mixed herbicide compositions for paddy field comprising herbicidal difluoromethane sulfonanilide and known herbicidal compounds as active ingredients.<br>
Background Art<br>
Certain difluoromethane sulfonanilides are known to exhibit a good weed controlling effect on lowland weeds (WO 2005/096818, Japanese Patent Application Laying-open No. 2006-56870).   However, contrary to our expectation, when using them actually, they may sometimes exhibit an insufficient herbicidal effect and pytotoxicity is also observed for paddy rice.   For the actual application, it is actually difficult to provide a single active compound having the property to respond to different uses due to existence of many undertones affecting their hertiicidal effects.   Particularly, the effects of active compounds are different depending on the type of the weeds to be controlled, the conditions of areas of weed emerging and the like.  Further, the development of agents exhibiting useful effects in lower dose is strongly required in consideration of cost saving in agriculture production and environmental consequences.<br>
To satisfy such requirements, herbicides are often used with other active compounds mixed to improve the properties of the herbicides.<br>
However, even use of such mixed agents may often fail to exert favorable effects because of.<br>
 <br>
for example, degradation of the active compounds, antagonism of their effects and the lil<e.></e.>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Now, the inventors have found that the compositions below exhibit very good and desirable effects in terms of weed control and, particularly, phytotoxicity of crops of useful plants such as of rice in paddy field.<br>
The present invention provides mixed herbicide compositions, preferably for paddy field, characterized by comprising, as active ingredients,<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
R^ represents a fluorine atom or a chlorine atom, R^ represents hydrogen, a fluorine atom or<br>
a chlorine atom, R^ represents hydrogen or a fluorine atom, R'* represents hydrogen or<br>
methyl, R^ represents hydrogen, R^ represents hydroxyl, a fluorine atom or a chlorine atom,<br>
or R^ and RÂ® may be taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached to form<br>
C=0, and X represents CH or N,<br>
provided that the following cases are excluded:<br>
(i)	when R^, R^, R" and R^ represent hydrogen and R^ represents hydroxyl,<br>
and<br>
(ii)	R^ R^ and R' represent hydrogen and R^ and R^ are taken together with<br>
the carbon atom to which they are attached to form C=0; and<br>
 <br>
(b)	one or more herbicidal compounds selected from the group consisting of pretilachlor, butachlor, alachlor, metolachlor, acetochlor, clomeprop, bromobutide, benfuresate, indanofan, pyrazolate, benzofenap, pyrazoxyfen, pyraclonil, oxazidomefone, bensulfuron-methyl, azimsulfuron, imazosulfuron, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, cyclosulfamuron, ethoxysulfuron, halosulfuron-methyl, orthosulfamuron, cinosulfuron, metosulfuron-methyl, flucetosulfuron, TH547 (Code No.), NC620 (Code No.), penoxsulam, thiobencarb, pyributicarb, molinate, dimethametryn, simetryn, cafenstrole, quinclorac, anilofos, mefenacet, fentrazamide, pentoxazone, oxadiargyl, oxadiazon, benzobicyclon, mesotrione, AVH301{Code No.), cyhalofop-butyl, metamifop, bispyribac-sodium salt, pyriftalid, pyrimisulfan, pyriminobac-methyl, chlomethoxynil, oxyfluorfen, dithiopyr, MCPA, MCPB, 2,4-D, daimuron, cumyluron, quinoclamine and clomazone; and, optionally,<br>
(c)	one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of dymron (daimuron), isoxadifen(-ethyl), flurazole, fenchlorazole-ethyl, fenclorim, doquintocet-mexyl, oxabetrinil, fluxofenim, mefenpyr-diethyl, furilazole, R-29148 (Code No.), benoxacor, dichlormid and dicyclonon as a safener.<br>
According to the above composition of the invention, surprisingly, the compositions exhibit substantially higher weed controlling effect (synergetic effect) than the sum of the effects derived from the single uses of each compound contained in the composition, resulting in allowing the used concentration of each drug to be substantially reduced. Also, the optimum time of weed controlling treatment may be extended for a long time, and, for example, in wet rice culture, good weed controlling effect may be obtained in any stages at onset of weed emergence shortly after implantation and over the growing period and thus their potency may be prolonged for a long time, resulting in the effident compositions having good residual efficacy and no damages against paddy rice obtained.<br>
In the composition of the invention, preferred spedfic examples of tine compound (a) of the formula (I) include those shown in Table A below.<br>

However, use of the composition of the invention is not intended to be limited to uses against theses weeds, and can be used against other weeds as well.<br>
The composition of the invention may be formulated into general preparation forms in uses for control of lowland weeds. The examples of the formulations may include, for example,<br>
 <br>
solution, emulsion, wettable powder, suspension, powder, soluble powder, granule, suspended dense emulsion, solid Gumbo), floating granule, microcapsule in polymeric materials and the like.<br>
These formulations may be prepared according to methods known per se. For example, the formulation according to the invention may be prepared by mixing the compound (a) of the formula (I) and the herbicidal compounds (b) and/or compounds (c) together with spreading agents such as liquid diluents and/or solid diluents, and, if desired, surfactants such as emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam forming agents.<br>
When water is used as a spreading agent, organic solvents, for example, may be used as an auxiliary solvent. Liquid diluents may include, for example, organic solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. xylene, toluene, alkylnaphthalene etc.), chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocariDons (e.g. chlorobenzens, ethylene chlorides, methylene chlorides etc.), aliphatic hydrocariDons (e.g. cyclohexanes or paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils)), alcohols (e.g. butanol, glycol and ethers or esters thereof etc.), ketones (e.g. acetone, methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, cyclohexanone etc.), strong polar solvents (e.g. dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide etc.) and water.<br>
Solid diluents may include, for example, ammonium salts, crushed natural minerals (e.g. kaolin, clay, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, diatomaceous earth etc.), crushed synthetic minerals (e.g. highly-dispersive silic acid, alumina, silicate etc.). Solid camers which can be used for powders may include, for example, crushed and fractionated rocks (e.g. calcite, martDJe, pumice stone, sepiolite, dolomite etc.), synthetic granules of inorganic or organic powders, fine particles of organic materials (e.g. sawdust, coconut shells, corncob, stalk of Indian weed etc.).<br>
Emulsifiers and/or foams may include nonionic or anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty add esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers (e.g. alkylarylpolyglycol ethers, alkyl<br>
 <br>
sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, aryl sulfonates etc.)), albumin hydrolyzed products and the like.<br>
Suitable dispersants include, for example, lignin sulfite waste liquor, methylcellulose and the<br>
like.<br>
Adhesive agents may be used for the formulations (powder, granule, emulsion), such as<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, natural or synthetic polymers (e.g. acacia, polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyvinyl acetates etc.), natural phosphatides (e.g. cephalins or lecithins), synthetic<br>
phosphatides and the like. Further, mineral oils or vegetable oils may be also used as<br>
additives.<br>
Colorants may be used, such as inorganic pigments (e.g. ferric oxide, titanic oxide, Prussian<br>
blue etc.), organic pigments (e.g. alizarin dyes, azo dyes or metallophthalocyanine dyes etc.)<br>
as well as trace elements (e.g. salts of iron, manganese, boron, cupper, cobalt, molybdenum<br>
or zinc etc.).<br>
The formulation may contain the compound (a) of the formula (I) and the herbicidal compound (b) and, optionally, the compound (c) in the range of concentration from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight in total.<br>
The composition of the invention may be used as it is or in the form of a dmg formulation to control weeds, or alternatively the compounds of the composition can be tank-mixed at the point of use, and it may contain other known active compounds, particularly active compounds to be generally used, particularly used for paddy field, such as bactericides, insecticides, plant regulators, plant nutritional agents, soil conditioners and the like. Additionally, the use the compositions together with external adjuvants is also possible and may improve the performance of the compositions. The extemal adjuvants can be added to the tank-mix or applied separately to the plants or the area where they are growing.<br>
The composition of the invention may be used as it is or in the form of a drug formulation, or altematively in the application form prepared by further dilution of said drug formulation, such as ready-to-use solution, emulsion, suspension, powder, wettable powder or granule.   The<br>
 <br>
formulafons in these fonns may be applied to the weed plants or the area were they are growing, preferably to the paddy field, according to general methods such as watering, spraying or atomizing, dusting, granule application and the like.<br>
The composition of the invention may be applied to the weed plants or the area where they are growing before, during or after emergence of the weed plants or the crop plants. The compositions preferably may be applied to the paddy rice field before, during or after rice planting. The amount of the composition to be applied may vary within the substantial range. The application amount may be, for example, within the range of 0.01 to 5 kg/ha, preferably 0.06 to 4.5 kg/ha, in total of the compound (a) of the formula (I), the herbicidal compound (b) and, optionally, the compound (c).<br>

In a greenhouse, seeds or tubers of Echinochloa, Cyperus diiformis L, Scirpusjuncoides Roxburgh, l\/lonochoria vaginalis PresI, annual broad-leaved weeds {Lindemia procumbens Philcox, Lindernia dubia L Penn.,-Rotala indica Koehne, Elatine triandra Schk, Ammannia multiflora Roxb), Cyperus serotinus Rottboel and Sagittaria pygmaea Miq. were inoculated in a 500cm^ pot filled with paddy field soil. After 2 leaf-stage of rice were transplanted, water was poured to a depth of about 3 cm. At 3.0 leaf-stage of Echinochloa, a prescribed, diluted solution of the formulation of each active compound and each herbicidal compound in the table was separately or simultaneously applied to the surface of water.  After the treatment, the water depth of 3cm was maintained, and herbicidal effect was examined after 4 weeks. In the assessment of the herbicidal effect and the phytotoxicity, 100% refers to complete death and 0% refers to no effect or no phytotoxicity.<br>
