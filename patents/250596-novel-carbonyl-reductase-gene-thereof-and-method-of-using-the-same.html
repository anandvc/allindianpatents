[0016]<br>
       Fig. 1 shows a production method and a structure of a recombinant vector pNTOM4Gl. Best Mode for Embodying the Invention<br>
[0017]<br>
       The present invention is explained in detail in the following.<br>
(3S)-l-Chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-<br>
4<br><br>
2-butanone described in the present specification can be prepared, for example, by the method disclosed in JP-A-62-126158 or JP-A-2-42048. In addition, unless otherwise specified, isolation of DNA, preparation of vector, gene manipulation such as transformation described in the present specification can be performed by methods described in books such as Molecular Cloning 2nd Edition (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) and the like. Moreover, "%" used in the description of the present specification means "%(w/v)" unless otherwise specified. [0018]<br>
      The polypeptide of the present invention is a polypeptide having an activity to asymmetrically reduce (3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanone to produce (2R,3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol. Such polypeptide can be isolated from a microorganism having the activity. [0019]<br>
      While the microorganism to be the origin of the polypeptide of the present invention is not particularly limited, for example, a yeast belonging to the genus Ogataea can be used. Particularly preferred is Ogataea minuta var. minuta, NBRC0975 strain. The microorganism can be obtained from the Incorporated Administrative Agency, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Biological Resource Center (NBRC: 2-5-8 Kazusakamatari, Kisarazu-shi 292-0818 Chiba, Japan). [0020]<br>
       As a medium for cultivating a microorganism to be the origin of the polypeptide of the present invention, general liquid nutritional media including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, organic nutrients and the like can be used as long as the<br>
5<br><br>
microorganism grows.<br>
[0021]<br>
       The polypeptide of the present invention can be isolated from the microorganism to be the origin of the polypeptide by appropriately combining generally known protein purification methods. For example, the isolation can be performed as follows.<br>
[0022]<br>
       First, the microorganism is cultured in a suitable medium, and the cells are collected from the cultured medium by centrifugation or filtration. The obtained cells were disrupted by a physical means using an ultrasonic disintegrator, glass beads and the like, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation to give a cell-free extract. Then, the polypeptide of the present invention is isolated from the cell-free extract by a method such as salting-out (ammonium sulfate precipitation, sodium phosphate precipitation and the like), solvent precipitation (protein fractionation precipitation by acetone, ethanol and the like), dialysis, gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, ultrafiltration and the like, alone or in combination.<br>
[0023]<br>
       The activity to reduce (3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanone can be determined, for example, by adding a 0.2 mM substrate, (3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanone, a 0.25 mM coenzyme, NADPH and a crude enzyme to a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.33% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, reacting the mixture at 30°C for 1 min and calculating the activity from the decreasing rate of absorbance at a wavelength of 340 nm after the reaction.<br>
[0024]<br>
6<br><br>
      In addition, the determination of absolute configuration and measurement of diastereomeric excess of (3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol produced by the above-mentioned reaction can be performed by high performance liquid chromatography (column: COSMOSIL 5C8-MS (cp4.6 mmx250 mm; manufactured by Nacalai Tesque), eluent: 10 mM aqueous phosphoric acid solution/acetonitrile=l/l (v/v), flow rate: 1 ml/min, detection: 210 nm). [0025]<br>
       The DNA of the present invention is a DNA encoding the aforementioned polypeptide of the present invention, and may be any as long as it can express the polypeptide in a host cell transformed according to the below-mentioned method, and may contain any untranslated region. Once the polypeptide can be acquired, those of ordinary skill in the art can obtain such DNA by a known method from a microorganism to be the origin of the polypeptide. For example, it can be obtained by the following method.<br>
[0026]<br>
       First, an isolated polypeptide of the present invention is digested with a suitable endopeptidase, and the resulting peptide fragments are fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Then, for example, using an ABI492 protein sequencer (manufactured by Applied Biosystems), a part or the whole amino acid sequence of the peptide fragments are determined.<br>
[0027]<br>
       Based on the information of the amino acid sequence obtained in this way, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) primers for amplifying a part of a DNA encoding the polypeptide are synthesized. Then, a chromosomal DNA of a microorganism to be the origin of the polypeptide is prepared by a general DNA isolation method, for example,<br>
7<br><br>
the method of Visser and the like (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 53, 415 (2000)). Using the chromosomal DNA as a template and the aforementioned PCR primers, PCR is performed to amplify a part of the DNA encoding the polypeptide and determine the base sequence thereof. The base sequence can be determined, for example, using ABI373A DNA Sequencer (manufactured by Applied Biosystems) and the like.<br>
[0028]<br>
       Once a part of the base sequence of the DNA encoding the polypeptide is clarified, the full-length sequence can be determined, for example, by i-PCR (Nucl. Acids Res., 16, 8186 (1988)).<br>
[0029]<br>
       Examples of the DNA of the present invention obtained in this way include a DNA containing the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a DNA containing the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. In addition, a DNA that hybridizes to a DNA consisting of a base sequence complementary to the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 under stringent conditions, which encodes a polypeptide having an activity to asymmetrically reduce ( 3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanone to produce<br>
(2R,3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol, is also encompassed in the DNA of the present invention.<br>
[0030]<br>
       The DNA that hybridizes to a DNA consisting of a base sequence complementary to the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 under stringent conditions refers to a DNA that specifically forms a hybrid with a DNA having a base sequence complementary to the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2, when colony hybridization method, plaque<br>
8<br><br>
hybridization method, Southern hybridization method and the like are performed.<br>
[0031]<br>
       As used herein the stringent conditions refer to, for example, the conditions under which hybridization in an aqueous solution of a composition of 75 mM trisodium citrate, 750 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0.1% Ficoll 400 (manufactured<br>
by Amersham Biosciences) is performed at 65°C, followed by washing with an aqueous solution of a composition of 15 mM trisodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, and<br>
0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate at 60°C. Preferably, they refer to the conditions under which washing with an aqueous solution of a composition of 15 mM trisodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, and 0.1% sodium<br>
dodecylsulfate is performed at 65°C after hybridization under the above-mentioned conditions. More preferably, they refer to the conditions under which washing with an aqueous solution of a composition of 1.5 mM trisodium citrate, 15 mM sodium chloride, and 0.1% sodium<br>
dodecylsulfate is performed at 65°C after the hybridization in the same manner as above.<br>
[0032]<br>
       Examples of the polypeptide of the present invention include a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 encoded by the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 encoded by the base sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
[0033]<br>
       In addition, a polypeptide showing at least a certain level of homology to either of these two kinds of polypeptides and having an activity to asymmetrically reduce (3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-<br>
9<br><br>
phenyl-2-butanone to produce (2R,3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol is functionally equivalent to these two kinds of polypeptides and encompassed in the present invention.<br>
[0034]<br>
       As used herein, the homology of the sequence is expressed, for example, by the value of Identity relative to the whole sequence when two amino acid sequences are comparatively analyzed using a homology search program FASTA (W.R. Pearson &amp; D.J. Lipman; Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 2444-2448 (1988)). Examples of the polypeptide equivalent to the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4 include a polypeptide showing not less than 78% (a homology between the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 is 78%), preferably not less than 80%, more preferably not less than 85%, still more preferably not less than 90%, of homology to either of these two kinds of polypeptides.<br>
[0035]<br>
       Such polypeptide can be obtained, for example, by ligating a DNA that can be hybridized to a DNA consisting of a base sequence complementary to the base sequence shown by the aforementioned SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 under stringent conditions, into a suitable vector and introducing the vector into a suitable host cell to allow expression. Moreover, such polypeptide can be obtained, for example, by causing substitution, insertion, deletion or addition of amino acid in a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4, according to a known method described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology<br>
(John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1989) and the like.<br>
[0036]<br>
Examples of the polypeptide obtained by the latter<br>
10<br><br>
method include a polypeptide obtained by substituting the 42nd alanine with glycine, the 43rd glutamic acid with alanine, the 46th lysine with glutamic acid and/or the 49th asparagine with lysine in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4. A polypeptide having all these four mutations (mutant polypeptide 1) is shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, and a DNA encoding the polypeptide (mutant DNA 1) is shown in SEQ ID NO: 15. [0037]<br>
       The vector to be used for introducing the DNA of the present invention into a host microorganism to allow expression of the DNA in the host microorganism is not particularly limited as long as the DNA can express the encoded gene in a suitable host microorganism. Examples of the vectors include plasmid vector, phage vector, cosmid vector and the like. In addition, a shuttle vector capable of gene exchange with other host cells can also be used.<br>
[0038]<br>
       Such vector generally contains a regulator such as lacUVS promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter, tac promoter, lpp promoter, tufB promoter, recA promoter, pL promoter and the like, and can be preferably used as an expression vector containing an expression unit operably linked to the DNA of the present invention. For example, pUCNT (WO94/03613) can be preferably used.<br>
[0039]<br>
       The term "regulator" used in the present specification refers to a base sequence having a functional promoter and any related transcriptional element (e.g., enhancer, CCAAT box, TATA box, SPI moiety and the like).<br>
[0040]<br>
       The term "operably linked" used in the present specification means that various regulatory elements<br>
11<br><br>
such as a promoter, an enhancer and the like, that control the gene expression, and a gene are connected in an operable state in a host cell. It is a well known matter to those of ordinary skill in the art that the type and kind of regulator can vary depending on the host. [0041]<br>
      Examples of the expression vector of the present invention include pNTOM3 wherein the DNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 has been introduced into pUCNT, pNTOM4 wherein the DNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 has been introduced into pUCNT, pNTOM5 wherein the DNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 15 has been introduced into pUCNT, which are mentioned below, and the like.<br>
[0042]<br>
      As the host cell, into which a vector containing the DNA of the present invention is introduced, bacterium, yeast, filamentous bacterium, plant cell, animal cell and the like can be used. Since introduction and/or culture are/is easy, bacterium is preferable, and Escherichia coli is particularly preferable. The vector containing the DNA of the present invention can be introduced into a host cell by a known method. When Escherichia coli is used as a host cell, for example, a commercially available E. coli HB101 competent cell<br>
(manufactured by TAKARA BIO) can be used to introduce the vector into the host cell.<br>
[0043]<br>
      Examples of the transformant of the present invention include E. coli HB101 (pNTMO3) FERM BP-10368 wherein the aforementioned pNTMO3 has been introduced into E. coli HB101, E. coli HB101 (pNTOM4) FERM BP-10369 wherein the aforementioned pNTMO4 has been introduced into E. coli HB101, E. coli HB101 (pNTOM5) FERM BP-10370 wherein the aforementioned pNTMO5 has been introduced<br>
12<br><br>
into E. coli HB101, which are mentioned below, and the like. These transformants have been respectively-deposited under the aforementioned accession numbers in the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, International Patent Organism Depositary (IPOD: Central 6, 1-1-1, Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8566 Japan) (date of original deposit in Japan on June 3, 2004, the national deposit strains were transferred to the international deposit based on Budapest Treaty on July 6, 2005) .<br>
[0044]<br>
      When a compound having a carbonyl group is asymmetrically reduced to produce an optically active alcohol using the polypeptide of the present invention, a coenzyme such as NADH, NADPH and the like becomes necessary. However, the amount of an expensive coenzyme to be used can be drastically reduced by carrying out the reaction in the co-presence of a polypeptide capable of converting the oxidized coenzyme to a reduced form (hereinafter to be referred to as a coenzyme regenerating capability) a compound to be a substrate of the polypeptide, and the polypeptide of the present invention.<br>
[0045]<br>
      As the polypeptide having the coenzyme regenerating capability, for example, hydrogenase, formic acid dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase and the like can be used. Preferably, glucose dehydrogenase is used.<br>
[0046]<br>
      The optically active alcohol can be produced using the polypeptide of the present invention as follows. First, a compound having a carbonyl group to be the substrate, a coenzyme such as NADPH and the like, and<br>
13<br><br>
the polypeptide are added to a suitable solvent, and the mixture is stirred under an adjusted pH to carry out the reaction. When the reaction is carried out using the polypeptide of the present invention and a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability in combination, a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability (e.g., glucose dehydrogenase) and a compound (e.g., glucose) to be its substrate are further added to the above-mentioned reaction composition. [0047]<br>
       An aqueous solvent may be used for the reaction or a mixture of an aqueous solvent and an organic solvent may be used for the reaction. Examples of the organic solvent include toluene, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, hexane, isopropanol, diisopropyl ether, methanol, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of 10°C - 70°C, and the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained at 4 - 10. The reaction can be carried out by a batch process or a continuous process. For a batch process, the reaction substrate is added at a charge concentration of from 0.1% to 70% (w/v). Examples of the compound having a carbonyl group to be a substrate include (3S)-1-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanone. However, the compound is not particularly limited as long as it can be reduced under the aforementioned reaction conditions and converted to an optically active alcohol.<br>

       The reaction can be carried out similarly even when a transformant containing a DNA encoding the polypeptide, or a treated product thereof is used instead of the polypeptide of the present invention. Moreover, the reaction can be carried out similarly even when a transformant containing both a DNA encoding the<br>
14<br><br>
polypeptide of the present invention and a DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability, or a treated product thereof is used. The "treated product of transformant" means, for example, a cell treated with a surfactant or an organic solvent, a dried cell, a disrupted cell, crude extract of a cell and the like, as well as those fixed by a known means.<br>
[0049]<br>
      Particularly, when a transformant containing both a DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention and a DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability or a treated product thereof is used, an enzyme for regenerating a coenzyme does not need to be separately prepared and added, and an optically active alcohol can be produced efficiently.<br>
[0050]<br>
      A transformant containing both a DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention and a DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability can be obtained by incorporating both the DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention and the DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability into a single vector, and introducing the vector into a host cell, or respectively incorporating these two kinds of DNAs into two kinds of vectors belonging to different incompatible groups, and introducing the two kinds of vectors into a single host cell.<br>
[0051]<br>
      Examples of the vector incorporating both a DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention and a DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability include pNTOM3Gl, pNTOM4Gl and pNTOM5Gl, wherein a glucose dehydrogenase gene derived from Bacillus megaterium has been introduced into each<br>
15<br><br>
of the aforementioned expression vectors pNTOM3, pNTOM4 and pNTOM5, and the like. Examples of the transformant containing both the DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention and the DNA encoding a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability include E. coli HB101 (pNTOM3Gl), E. coli HB101 (pNTOM4Gl) and E. coli HB101 (pNTOM5Gl), wherein E. coli HB101 has been transformed with these vectors, and the like. [0052]<br>
      The activity of a polypeptide having a coenzyme regenerating capability in a transformant can be determined by a conventional method. For example, the activity of glucose dehydrogenase can be calculated from the rate of increase in the absorbance at a wavelength of 340 nm, when 100 mM glucose, 2 mM coenzyme NADP or NAD, and the enzyme are added to 1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and the mixture is reacted at 25°C for 1 min. [0053]<br>
      A transformant containing a DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention can be cultured in a conventional liquid nutritional medium containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, organic nutrients and the like, as long as it grows. [0054]<br>
      An optically active alcohol resulting from a reaction can be purified by a conventional method. For example, when the optically active alcohol resulting from a reaction is (2R,3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol, the reaction mixture is extracted with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, toluene and the like, and the organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. Moreover, it can be purified by a treatment such as crystal precipitation, chromatography and the like. [0055]<br>

[0056]<br>
       As mentioned above, according to the present invention, the polypeptide of the present invention can be efficiently produced and, utilizing the polypeptide, a superior production method of various useful optically active alcohols including (2R,3S)-l-chloro-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-phenyl-2-butanol can be provided.<br>
