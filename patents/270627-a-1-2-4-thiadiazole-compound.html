				<td>THIADIAZOLE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEURO DEGENERATIVE DISEASES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel thiadiazole derivatives useful for treating certain neurological disorders characterised by cytotoxic α-synuclein amyloidogenesis. The invention further relates to methods of treatment or prevention of such neurological disorders by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition, comprising one or more thiadiazole derivatives in an amount which alleviates or prevents the cytotoxic properties of α-synuclein. The invention further relates to methods of preparing novel thiadiazole derivatives, as well as certain classes of intermediates useful in such preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
a-Synuclein is a neuronal protein which originally has been associated with neuronal plasticity during Zebra finch song learning. Although its role at the molecular level is at present largely elusive it appears to have lipid bi-layer (or membrane) with binding properties important for preserving proper transport of neurotransmitter vesicles to the axonal ends of neurons presumably to ensure proper signalling at the synapse. Apart from its physiological role in brain cells, human α-synuclein also possesses pathological features that underlies a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Niemann-Pick disease, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Down syndrome, neuroaxonal dystrophy, multiple system atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. These neurological disorders are characterised by the presence of insoluble α-synuclein polymers or aggregates usually residing within neuronal cells, although in the case of Alzheimer's disease α-synuclein (or proteolytic fragments thereof) constitutes the non-amyloid component of extracellular" amyloid-(3 plaques ". It is widely believed that the amyloidogenic properties α-synuclein disrupt cellular integrity leading to dysfunctioning or death of affected neurons resulting in cognitive and/or motoric decline as it is found in patients suffering from such diseases. The aggregation of α-synuclein is at present very poorly defined, but constitutes most likely a multi-step process wherein self-polymerization of α-synuclein into insoluble aggregates is preceded by the formation of soluble protofibrils of a-synuclein monomers. Self-association may be triggered by the formation of alternative   conformations   of   α-synuclein   monomers   with   high   propensity   to<br>
polymerize. Several studies using neuronal cell lines or whole animals have shown that formation of reactive oxygen species (hereinafter abbreviated as ROS) appear to stimulate noxious α-synuclein amyloidogenesis. For instance paraquat (an agent stimulating ROS formation within the cell) has been recognized as a stimulator of a-synuclein aggregation. Like in animals, exposure to paraquat is believed to induce the formation of synuclein inclusions, and consequently neurodegeneration, especially of dopaminergic neurons in humans. Dopaminergic neurons appear to be particularly sensitive because the concurrent dopamine metabolism may on the one hand contribute significantly to the oxidative stress load but may on the other hand result in kinetic stabilisation of highly toxic protofibrillar α-synuclein species by dopamine (or its metabolic derivatives). Parkinson's disease is characterised by a selective loss of dopaminergic substantia nigra cells and therefore treatment of animals (or neuronal cells) with paraquat is a common well-accepted experimental set-up for studying synucleopathies, in particular Parkinson's disease.<br>
Apart from ROS, mutations in the coding region of the α-synuclein gene have also been identified as stimulators of self-polymerization resulting in early disease onset as it is observed in families afflicted by such mutations. Finally, increased expression of α-synuclein also promotes early disease onset as evidenced by a duplication or triplication of the α-synuclein gene in the genome of some individuals. The molecular mechanism by which α-synuclein self-association triggers cellular degeneration is at present largely unknown. Although it has been speculated that insoluble aggregates affect cellular integrity, it has recently been suggested that soluble protofibrillar intermediates of the aggregation process are particularly toxic for the cell as opposed to mature insoluble fibrils which may be inert end-products or may even serve as cytoprotective reservoirs of otherwise harmful soluble species. Therapeutic attempts to inhibit formation of insoluble aggregates may therefore be conceptually wrong, possibly even promoting disease progress.<br>
While the identification of pathological α-synuclein mutations unequivocally revealed a causative factor of a plethora of neurodegenerative disorders, treatments ensuring suppression of toxic α-synuclein amyloidogenesis are presently not available. Only symptomatic treatments of Parkinson's disease exist, which aim e.g. at increasing dopamine levels in order to replenish its lowered level due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, for instance by administrating L-DOPA or inhibitors of dopamine breakdown. Although such treatments suppress disease symptoms to some extent, they are only temporarily effective and certainly do not slow down ongoing neuronal degeneration.<br>
Thus there is a need in the art for designing new drugs for therapeutic treatments that target the underlying molecular mechanism of a-synuc lein related pathologies in order to reduce neuronal cell death and/or degeneration.<br>
WO 99/51584 discloses 5-piperazinyl-1,2,4-thiadiazoles as inhibitors of proton pump H+/K+-ATPase and therefor useful in the treatment of peptic ulcer. However these compounds are not suggested for use in the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a class of 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives that have been shown to effectively counteract or inhibit the toxic properties of α-synuclein . Administration of these compounds to patients suffering from a neurodegenerative disease characterised by noxious α-synuclein amyloidogenesis therefore constitutes an effective therapeutic and/or prophylactic method of treatment.<br>

According to this aspect, the invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of one or more such 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives, said compositions being useful for the prevention and/or treatment of an a-synucleopathy such as, but not limited to, Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, multiple system atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to the use of the 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of a-synucleopathies, such as, but not limited to Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, multiple system atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing such novel 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives in a limited number of steps and starting from commercially available materials or easily obtainable analogues thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, in a first aspect, to a group novel 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives which have desirable biological properties such as an inhibitory effect on α-synuclein mediated toxicity. Based on this inhibitory activity, and the fact that these compounds are not toxic to neural cells, these compounds are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of α-synucleopathies. In the broadest expression, the class of novel 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives of this invention may be represented by the structural formula (A) of claim 1, including stereoisomers, solvates and salts thereof. This broad class may be sub-divided into several sub-classes<br>
wherein each substituent R1 to R13, the divalent group (A'), and the linking moiety X may be defined in a more restricted manner, at will and independently from each other. Exemplary but non-limiting embodiments of such sub-classes are defined in claims 2 to 27.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit α-synuclein mediated toxicity is based on their activity in the α-synuclein cytotoxicity test described in the examples section herein. Treatment of mice with mitochondrial complex I inhibitors such as paraquat or MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is a well-accepted and commonly used experimental set-up to study neuronal degeneration. Paraquat triggers synuclein-aggregation, which allegedly triggers a specific loss of dopaminergic neurons and ultimately a decline in the locomotion function. Briefly, one or more compounds are administered to paraquat-receiving mice and the onset of motoric dysfunction is assessed using a rotary rod device. A delay or absence in the occurrence of motoric problems in compound treated mice (compared to control mice treated with only vehicle) indicates that the compound(s) inhibit(s) synuclein-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic cells.<br>
In the assays used herein, compounds were considered to be active when inhibiting α-synuclein cytotoxicity by more than 25% relative to controls at a concentration of 20 µg/mL or lower. Dose responses were carried out on all compounds found to be active (10 point curves in duplicate). Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds disclosed in this invention vary with structural change, active compounds particularly possess EC50's in a cell-based assay of synuclein cytotoxicity in a range from about 0.0001 to 10 uM. Based on these findings, methods for treating and preventing disorders or diseases provoked by cytotoxic intracellular α-synuclein are provided herein. These methods comprise administering to a subject suffering from or susceptible to such a disease or disorder, an effective amount of one or more inhibitors of α-synuclein cytotoxicity as defined by the broad structural formula (A) of the invention, or sub-classes thereof. As used herein, the term " effective amount " designates an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired clinical or biochemical results. An effective amount can be administered one or more times. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of an inhibitor of α-synuclein cytotoxicity is an amount that is sufficient to palliate, ameliorate, stabilize, reverse, slow down or delay the progression of a disease state or condition. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the " effective amount " is defined as an amount of compound capable of preventing deposition of insoluble a-synuclein polymers or aggregates and/or capable of preventing the cytotoxic effects<br><br>
triggered by aggregation or polymerization of α-synuclein, and is an amount that substantially reduces the symptoms of an a-synucleopathy, such as Parkinson's disease. Other forms of effective amount may be for the treatment or prevention of the learning or memory impairment related to Alzheimer's disease. As used herein, the terms " mammal ", " subject" or" patient" for the purposes of a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, such as but not limited to dogs, cats, pigs, horses, sheep, and the like. Most particularly, the mammal is a human being.<br>

Alternatively, intermediates having the structural formula (IV-A) or (IV-B) may be derivatised with a carbonylation agent such as, but not limited to, trisphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole (hereinafter abbreviated as CDI) or carbonyl ditriazole. The resulting imidazo-carbonyl compound may then be further reacted with an amino compound, particularly an aniline derivative wherein R7, R8, R9, R10, R11 are as defined above, thereby providing further compounds of the invention. The carbonylation and further urea formation with an amine may be most particularly carried out in a one-pot procedure. Amino compounds suitable for the latter reaction include arylamines, arylalkylamines, arylalkenylamines, arylalkynylamines wherein said one or more of the carbon atoms in the alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl moiety is optionally replaced by a heteroatom selected from the group comprising O, N and S, and wherein each of said amino compounds is optionally substituted.<br>

When step (c) comprises two sub-steps as described herein-above, the order of performing the different reactions is not critical for the invention and therefore can<br><br>
be changed. For example, the optionally substituted heterocyclic ring with at least two nitrogen atoms in the said heterocyclic ring and with a total of 5 to 7 atoms may first be reacted with either one of the reagents having the structural formula (V-A), (V-B), or (V-C), or CDI followed by reaction with a compound having the structural formula (V-D). The resulting compound may then be used for reaction with the 3-substituted-5-chloro-thiadiazole having the structural formula (III) to yield a final compound according to the invention.<br>
The above description provides a general synthesis scheme for making the 1,2,4-thiadiazole compounds of the present invention. A list of exemplary, but non-limiting, compounds which have been synthesised according to the described methods is provided in Table 1 herein.<br>
The 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives having the above structural formula (A) may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The latter include any therapeutically active non-toxic addition salt which 1,2,4-thiadiazole compounds having the general formula (A) are able to form with a salt-forming agent. Such addition salts may conveniently be obtained by treating the said derivative of the invention with an appropriate salt-forming acid or base. For instance, derivatives having basic properties may be converted into the corresponding therapeutically active, non-toxic acid addition salt form by treating the free base form with a suitable amount of an appropriate acid following conventional procedures. Examples of such appropriate salt-forming acids include, for instance, inorganic acids resulting in forming salts such as but not limited to hydrohalides (e.g. hydrochloride and hydrobromide), sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, diphosphate, carbonate, bicarbonate, and the like; and organic monocarboxylic or dicarboxylic acids resulting in forming salts such as, for example, acetate, propanoate, hydroxyacetate, 2-hydroxypropanoate, 2-oxopropanoate, lactate, pyruvate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, malate, tartrate, citrate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzoate, 2-hydroxy-benzoate, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, salicylate, p-aminosalicylate, pamoate, bitartrate, camphorsulfonate, edetate, 1,2-ethanedisulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, gluconate, glutamate, hexylresorcinate, hydroxynaphtoate, hydroxyethanesulfonate, mandelate, methylsulfate, pantothenate, stearate, as well as salts derived from ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic, (Z)-2-butenedioic, (E)2-butenedioic, 2-hydroxybutanedioic, 2,3-dihydroxybutane-dioic, 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic and cyclohexanesulfamic acids and the like.<br>
The 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives of the general formula (A) having acidic properties   may   be   converted   in   a   similar   manner   into   the   corresponding<br><br>
therapeutically active, non-toxic base addition salt form. Examples of appropriate salt-forming bases include, for instance, inorganic bases like metallic hydroxides such as but not limited to those of alkali and alkaline-earth metals like calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, or zinc, resulting in the corresponding metal salt; organic bases such as but not limited to ammonia, alkylamines, benzathine, hydrabamine, arginine, lysine, N.N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylene-diamine, N-methylglucamine, procaine and the like. Reaction conditions for treating the 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives having the structural formula (A) of this invention with an appropriate salt-forming acid or base are similar to standard conditions involving the same acid or base but different organic compounds with basic or acidic properties, respectively. Preferably, in view of its use in a pharmaceutical composition or in the manufacture of a medicament for treating specific diseases, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt will be designed, i.e. the salt-forming acid or base will be selected so as to impart greater water-solubility, lower toxicity, greater stability and/or slower dissolution rate to the derivative of this invention.<br>
In order to suitably use a 1,2,4-thiadiazole compound disclosed in this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pro-drug or solvate thereof, for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is usually formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition including one or more appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In another embodiment, this invention provides combinations, preferably synergistic combinations, of one or more derivatives represented by the general formula (A) with one or more biologically-active drugs being preferably selected from the group consisting of neuro-protective agents andn αsynuclein deposition inhibitors. As is conventional in the art, the evaluation of a synergistic effect in a drug combination may be made by analysing the quantification of the interactions between individual drugs, using the median effect principle described by Chou et al. in Adv. Enzyme Reg. (1984) 22:27. Briefly, this principle states that interactions (synergism, additivity, antagonism) between two drugs can be quantified using the combination index (hereinafter referred as CI) defined by the following equation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein EDX is the dose of the first or respectively second drug used alone (1a, 2a), or in combination with the second or respectively first drug (1c, 2c), which is needed<br><br>
to produce a given effect. The said first and second drug have synergistic or additive or antagonistic effects depending upon CI  1, respectively. As will be explained in more detail herein below, this principle may be applied to a number of desirable effects such as, but not limited to, an activity against neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The term " pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient" as used herein in relation to pharmaceutical compositions and combined preparations means any material or substance with which the active principle, i.e. the 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivative of the general formula (A), and optionally the neuro-protective agent or α-synuclein deposition inhibitor, may be formulated in order to facilitate its application or dissemination to the locus to be treated, for instance by dissolving, dispersing or diffusing the said composition, and / or to facilitate its storage, transport or handling without impairing its effectiveness. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be a solid or a liquid or a gas which has been compressed to form a liquid, i.e. the compositions of this invention can suitably be used as concentrates, emulsions, solutions, granulates, dusts, sprays, aerosols, pellets or powders.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for use in the said pharmaceutical compositions and their formulation are well known to those skilled in the art. There is no particular restriction to their selection within the present invention although, due to the usually low or very low water-solubility of the derivatives of this invention, special attention will be paid to the selection of suitable carrier combinations that can assist in properly formulating them in view of the expected time release profile. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include additives such as wetting agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, emulsifying or surface-active agents, thickening agents, complexing agents, gelling agents, solvents, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents (for example phenol, sorbic acid, chlorobutanol), isotonic agents (such as sugars or sodium chloride) and the like, provided the same are consistent with pharmaceutical practice, i.e. carriers and additives which do not create permanent damage to mammals.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be prepared in any known manner, for instance by homogeneously mixing, dissolving, spray-drying, coating and/or grinding the active ingredients, in a one-step or a multi-steps procedure, with the selected carrier material and, where appropriate, the other additives such as surface-active agents, may also be prepared by micronisation, for instance in view to obtain them in the form of microspheres usually having a diameter<br><br>
of about 1 to 10 urn, namely for the manufacture of microcapsules for controlled or sustained release of the biologically active ingredient(s).<br>
Suitable surface-active agents to be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and/or wetting properties. Suitable anionic surfactants include both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active agents. Suitable soaps are alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures obtainable form coconut oil or tallow oil. Synthetic surfactants include sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids; fatty sulphonates and sulphates; sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives and alkylarylsulphonates. Fatty sulphonates or sulphates are usually in the form of alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubstituted ammonium salts or ammonium salts substituted with an alkyl or acyl radical having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulphonic acid or dodecylsulphonic acid or a mixture of fatty alcohol sulphates obtained from natural fatty acids, alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters (such as sodium lauryl sulphate) and sulphonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. Suitable sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulphonates are the sodium, calcium or alcanolamine salts of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid or dibutyl-naphtalenesulphonic acid or a naphtalene-sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are the corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of phosphoric acid ester and an adduct of p-nonylphenol with ethylene and / or propylene oxide, or phospholipids. Suitable phospholipids for this purpose are the natural (originating from animal or plant cells) or synthetic phospholipids of the cephalin or lecithin type such as e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerine, lysolecithin, cardiolipin, dioctanyl-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphoshatidylcholine and their mixtures.<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants include polyethoxylated and polypropoxylated derivatives of alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule, alkylarenesulphonates and dialkylsulphosuccinates, such as polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives preferably containing 3 to 10 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenol. Further suitable non-ionic surfactants are water-soluble<br><br>
adducts of polyethylene oxide with poylypropylene glycol, ethylenediamino-polypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethyleneglycol ether groups and / or 10 to 100 propyleneglycol ether groups. Such compounds usually contain from 1 to 5 ethyleneglycol units per propyleneglycol unit. Representative examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenol-polyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycolic ethers, polypropylene/ polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethyleneglycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyethylene sorbitan (such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate), glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose and pentaerythritol are also suitable non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts, preferably halides, having four hydrocarbon radicals optionally substituted with halo, phenyl, substituted phenyl or hydroxy; for instance quaternary ammonium salts containing as N-substituent at least one C8-C22 alkyl radical (e.g. cetyl, lauryl, palmityl, myristyl, oleyl and the like) and, as further substituents, unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl and / or hydroxy-Ci^ alkyl radicals.<br>
A more detailed description of surface-active agents suitable for this purpose may be found for instance in " McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual " (MC Publishing Crop., Ridgewood, New Jersey, 1981), " Tensid-Taschenbuch ", 2nd ed. (Hanser Verlag, Vienna, 1981) and " Encyclopaedia of Surfactants (Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1981).<br>
Structure-forming, thickening or gel-forming agents may be included into the pharmaceutical compositions and combined preparations of the invention. Suitable such agents are in particular highly dispersed silicic acid, such as the product commercially available under the trade name Aerosil; bentonites; tetraalkyl ammonium salts of montmorillonites (e.g., products commercially available under the trade name Bentone), wherein each of the alkyl groups may contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; cetostearyl alcohol and modified castor oil products (e.g. the product commercially available under the trade name Antisettle).<br>

Gelatin and modified celluloses represent a preferred class of gelling agents.<br><br>
Other optional excipients which may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions and combined preparations of the present invention include additives such as magnesium oxide; azo dyes; organic and inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide; UV-absorbers; stabilisers; odor masking agents; viscosity enhancers; antioxidants such as, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite and the like, and mixtures thereof; preservatives such as, for example, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid, propyl gallate, benzylalcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and the like; sequestering agents such as ethylene-diamine tetraacetic acid; flavoring agents such as natural vanillin; buffers such as citric acid and acetic acid; extenders or bulking agents such as silicates, diatomaceous earth, magnesium oxide or aluminum oxide; densification agents such as magnesium salts; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Additional ingredients may be included in order to control the duration of action of the biologically-active ingredient in the compositions and combined preparations of the invention. Control release compositions may thus be achieved by selecting appropriate polymer carriers such as for example polyesters, polyamino-acids, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxy-methylcellulose, protamine sulfate and the like. The rate of drug release and duration of action may also be controlled by incorporating the active ingredient into particles, e.g. microcapsules, of a polymeric substance such as hydrogels, polylactic acid, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polymethyl methacrylate and the other above-described polymers. Such methods include colloid drug delivery systems like liposomes, microspheres, microemulsions, nanoparticles, nanocapsules and so on. Depending on the route of administration, the pharmaceutical composition or combined preparation of the invention may also require protective coatings.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation thereof. Typical carriers for this purpose therefore include biocompatible aqueous buffers, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, complexing agents such as cyclodextrins and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In order to suitably use compounds disclosed in this invention for therapeutic or prophylactic purpose, such compounds are preferably administered so that a daily dose in the range of, for example, 0.1 mg to 75 mg per kg body weight is received, said daily dose being given if required in divided sub-doses. In general, lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range of, for example, 0.5 mg to 30 mg per<br><br>
kg body weight will preferably be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range of, for example, 0.5 mg to 25 mg per kg body weight will preferably be used. According to a particular embodiment, the envisaged administration route for the compounds of the invention is oral administration, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 1 mg to 500 mg of a compound of this invention.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention includes the various precursor or " prodrug " forms of the compounds of the present invention. It may be desirable to formulate the compounds of the present invention in the form of a chemical species which itself is not significantly biologically-active, but which when delivered to the body of a human being or higher mammal will undergo a chemical reaction catalysed by the normal function of the body, inter alia, enzymes present in the stomach or in blood serum, said chemical reaction having the effect of releasing a compound as defined herein. The term " pro-drug " thus relates to these species which are converted in vivo into the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The pro-drugs of the present invention can have any form suitable to the formulator, e.g. esters. In the present case, however, the pro-drug may necessarily exist in a form wherein a covalent bond is cleaved by the action of an enzyme present at the target locus. For example, a C-C covalent bond may be selectively cleaved by one or more enzymes at said target locus and, therefore, a pro-drug in a form other than an easily hydrolysable precursor, inter alia an ester, an amide, and the like, may be used.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term " therapeutically suitable pro-drug " is defined herein as a compound modified in such a way as to be transformed in vivo to the therapeutically active form, whether by way of a single or by multiple biological transformations, when in contact with the tissues of humans or mammals to which the pro-drug has been administered, and without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response, and achieving the intended therapeutic outcome.<br>

Example 2 - synthesis of intermediate 3-benzvl-5-chloro-1.2.4-thiadiazole derivatives<br>
The intermediate 3-benzyl-5-chloro-1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives in step (b) of scheme 1 have been obtained according to the following procedure. In a three-necked 500mL flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a thermometer, dichloromethane (DCM) (130 ml) was charged and the appropriate amidine hydrochloride (0.1 mol) was suspended in it upon efficient stirring. Then perchloromethyl mercaptane (16.73 g) was added to the suspension. The stirred solution was cooled to -14°C by using ammonium chloride-ice cooling bath. Then aqueous NaOH solution (0.5 mole dissolved in 30 ml distilled water) was added dropwise to the solution upon efficient stirring while keeping the inner temperature accurately below -8°C. When the addition was finished the reaction mixture was stirred for another hour while the temperature was let to rise to room temperature. The precipitated NaCI was filtered off and washed with DCM. The organic phase of the filtrate was separated and saved. The aqueous phase was washed with 3x20 ml DCM. The collected organic phases including the previously saved solution were washed with water (4x20 ml). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium<br><br>
sulphate and evaporated to dryness. The residue was distilled in high motor vacuum using a vacuum-jacketed Vigreaux-column.<br>

A piperazine derivative (50 mmole) was dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) (10-20 ml) and a chlorothiadiazole derivative (10 mmole) from example 2 was added in portions. The reaction mixture was refluxed until the reaction was complete. The course of the reaction was monitored by thin layered chromatography (TLC) in an eluent mixture of DCM-EtOH 5:1.

The ionization mode used Electrospray in a positive mode, with centroid data analysis and mass in the range of 120-700 µ.<br>
Example 9 - Construction of an α-synuclein over-expressing cell line<br>
An α-synuclein expression plasmid was constructed by sub-cloning the Ncol/Xhol fragment from 212T-SYN(WT) (Griffioen et al., Biochem Biophys Acta (2006) 1762(3):312-318) containing the cDNA of human wild type α-synuclein correspondingly into a standard mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 resulting in plasmid pcDNA3.1-SYNwt. Plasmid pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-SYNwt were transfected to human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC No. CRL-2267) and independent clonal lines with the plasmids stably integrated into the genome were selected. These resulted in cell lines named M17 (transfected with pcDNA3.1) and M17-SYNwt (transfected with pcDNA3.1-SYNwt). Over-expression of α-synuclein in M17-SYNwt cell lines was confirmed by Western analysis.<br>
Example 10: Use of α-synuclein expressing cells as a model for neuronal degradation<br>
Due to the high levels of α-synuclein M17-SYNwt cells are exquisitely sensitivity to paraquat, a well-known risk factor of synuclein-dependent neuronal degeneration. In degenerated or dead cells lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is leaked out of the cells into the extracellular environment due to a loss of plasma-membrane integrity. This principle was used to determine cytotoxicity by quantifying the level of leaked LDH into the growth medium.<br>
The detailed method for determining α-synuclein cytotoxicity was as follows: From appropriate precultures of M17 and M17-SYN cells were seeded at 50000 cells/cm2 in Optimem Reduced Serum without phenol red (InVitrogen, Cat. 31985-047) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 x nonessential amino acids, 500 µg/ml G418 0,5 x antibiotic/antimycotic. After 3 hours of incubation at 37°C/5% CO2 paraquat was added to the cells (final concentration of 32 mM), together with the test compound and the cells were further incubated for 40 hours. Subsequently, LDH activity was determined using Promega Cytotox 96 Non-Radioactive cytotoxicity assay, (Cat. G1780) according the supplier's instructions.<br>
Figure 1 shows that treatment of M17-SYNwt cells, but not of M17 cells with paraquat led to a relatively high level of LDH leaked into the medium demonstrating that α-synuclein mediates cellular degeneration or cell death in response to paraquat.<br>

This α-synuclein expressing neuroblastoma cells made it possible to assess the ability of novel compounds to counteract α-synuclein cytotoxicity. Active inhibitors of α-synuclein cytotoxicity were found to provoke a decrease of LDH leakage in paraquat-treated M17-SYNwt cells. Since this method monitors leaked LDH from degenerated or dead cells only non-toxic compounds will be identified as active inhibitors of α-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity. Lack of toxicity is an important characteristic for compounds to be used as a medicament to patients in need. A compound was considered to be active in this test when it inhibits α-synuclein cytotoxicity by more than 25% relative to untreated M17-SYNwt cells at a concentration of 20 µg/mL or lower. In the experiments, the control group consisted of M17-SYNwt cells treated with DMSO, the untreated paraquat group consisted of M17-SYNwt cells treated with paraquat and DMSO, and the treated paraquat group consisted of M17-SYNwt cells treated with paraquat and the test compound dissolved in DMSO.<br>
In order to determine EC50 compounds were tested at different concentrations ranging from non-effective (thus at a relatively low concentration) to an effective (relatively high) concentration of test compound. These data were also used for calculation of percent inhibition (% I). Percent inhibition was calculated as the synu-clein toxicity inhibition by the compound in treated paraquat cells, relative to the synuclein cytotoxicity in untreated paraquat cells. This corresponds to the following equation:<br>
(LDH release of treated paraquat cells at non-effective concentration of test cmpd) -(LDH release of treated paraquat cells at most effective concentration of test cmpd) / (LDH release of untreated paraquat cells) - (LDH release control cells) *100%<br>
Compounds 19 (N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-4-[3-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl]-2-methylpiperazine-1-carboxamide) and 111 (2-phenyl-N-{2-[4-[3-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl]piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}butanamide) were tested using the α-synuclein cytotoxicity assay as described above. Figure 2 shows that these compounds (compound 19 = squares; compound 111 = triangles) were able, in a dose-dependent manner, to reduce LDH activity in the medium demonstrating that the respective compounds alleviate α-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity.<br>
Example 12 - inhibition of svnuclein-mediated toxicity<br>
1,2,4-thiadazole compounds made according to the methods described herein were screened for activity using the α-synuclein cytotoxicity assay as described above. Dose responses were carried out on all compounds found to be active (10 point curves in duplicate). Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds disclosed in this invention vary with structural change as expected, active compounds most particularly possess EC50 in a cell-based assay of synuclein cytotoxicity in a range from about 0.0001 to 10 uM. Data obtained for the compounds of Table 1 are presented in Table 2. Based on these results the novel class of inhibitors of a-synuclein cytotoxicity as claimed herein was identified.<br>
Example 13 : in vivo inhibition of svnuclein-mediated instigated loss of substantia nigra neurons<br>
In order to model neuronal loss in the substantia nigra region of the brain, mice were treated with paraquat (intraperitoneal) at a dose not higher than 8 mg/kg/day for a continuous period of 15-100 days. These mice were also chronically co-treated during that period with:<br>
-	compound   60   (1-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]-4-[3-(4-methylbenzyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl]-2-methylpiperazine), or<br>
-	compound    32    (1-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]-4-[3-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl]piperazine), or<br>
compound 53 (1-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]-4-[3-(3-methoxy-benzyl)-1,2,4-<br>
thiadiazol-5-yl]piperazine), each being administered at a dose not higher than 20 mg/kg body weight/day), or by vehicle only (no active compound).  Mice treatment by means of vehicle or a compound of the invention started 2 days before administration of paraquat.<br>
At the end of the treatment period, mice were sacrificed and the corresponding brains were used for immunohistochemical analysis. The substantia nigra brain region has a relatively high percentage of cells with high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase. Using antibodies raised against tyrosin hydroxylase (anti-tyrosin hydroxylase), tyrosine hydroxylase containing neurons in the brains were detected. Quantitative and comparative analysis of the tyrosin hydroxylase-positive stained substantia nigra areas revealed a significantly larger TH-positive area in mice treated with compound (group 3) versus vehicle treated mice (group 2). The TH-positive area of group 3 is similar of that observed in mouse group 1 (not treated with paraquat), suggesting a strong and possibly complete inhibition of degeneration. These results<br><br>
indicate that the corresponding compound is able to inhibit paraquat-triggered degeneration of substantia nigra cells in vivo.<br>
Figure 3 shows that compound 53 protects dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons against paraquat-triggered degeneration. Three groups of mice were treated with either paraquat and compound 53 (group 3; n=6), or paraquat and vehicle of compound 53 (group 2; n=4), or vehicle paraquat and vehicle of compound 53 (group 1; n=3). After 8 weeks treatment, brains were collected and used for immunohistochemistry (6 sections per brain per staining). Mouse brain were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stored in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide. Free-floating vibratome-sections of 40 µm were prepared and stored in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. 6 midbrain sections of each brain were selected for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. After quenching the endogenous peroxidase by using 1.5% H2O2 in 1/1 PBS/methanol, sections were blocked in 10% fetal calf serum (30 minutes) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-TH (1:10.000; MAB318; Chemicon International). After washing and incubation with a HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500; P 0447; DakoCytomation) for 60 minutes, immunostaining was visualized with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin. Per mouse, the median %TH-positive areas (of the substantia nigra regions) was determined. Results shown (Figure 3) are the mean ±SEM of the median %TH-positive areas of the different mouse brains of each group.<br>
Example 14 - in vivo inhibition of 6-hvdroxvdopamine (6-OHDA) instigated loss of substantia nigra neurons<br>
Unilateral substantia nigra lesions are obtained by stereotactic striatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in brains of living rats as described by Vercammen et al. in Molecular Therapy, 14(5) 716-723 (2006). These rats are also chronically co-treated with the same exemplary compounds and at the same dose as mentioned in example 13, or by vehicle only (no active compound). Daily treatment of compound or vehicle is started preferably 1 or 2 days before administration of 6-OHDA and lasts between 7 to 30 days after the 6-OHDA injection.<br>
At the end of the treatment period, rats are sacrificed and the corresponding brains are used for immunohistochemical analysis. The substantia nigra brain region has a relatively high percentage of cells with high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase. Using antibodies raised against tyrosin hydroxylase (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase) tyrosine hydroxylase containing neurons in the brains are detected. The nigral lesion<br>
volumes and/or the tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell numbers are quantified as described in Vercammen et al. (cited supra). This analysis reveals that:<br>
-	the nigral lesion volumes are significantly reduced in rats treated with a compound according to this invention, as compared to vehicle treated rats, thus indicating that the compound is able to inhibit 6-OHDA triggered degeneration of substantia nigra cells in vivo; and<br>
-	tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell numbers are higher in rats treated with a compound according to this invention as compared to vehicle treated rats, thus providing confirmation that the compound is able to inhibit 6-OHDA triggered degeneration of substantia nigra cells in vivo.<br>
Example 15 - in vitro inhibition of a-svnuclein aggregation<br>
α-synucleinopathies are characterised by aggregation of α-synuclein in neurons. Aggregation of purified α-synuclein is performed essentially as described by Gerard et al. FASEB. 20(3):524-6 (2006). 20-100 ug purified α-synuclein (Sigma; S7820) at a concentration of about 2.5 µg/mL is incubated in the presence of spermin (250 uM) or paraquat (32 mM) or 6-hydroxydopamine (400 uM) or vehicle in a 384 well plate. Spermin, paraquat and 6-hydroxydopamine promote the α-synuclein aggregation process. Aggregation kinetics is determined by measuring turbidity at  340 nm, every 1-15 minutes for at least one hour. The same exemplary compounds as mentioned in example 13, or vehicle only, is added to the different α-synuclein mixtures described above. This analysis reveals that, when a compound is present, the measured turbidity is lower compared to reactions containing vehicle only. This finding shows that the compound is able to inhibit aggregation of α-synuclein.<br>
