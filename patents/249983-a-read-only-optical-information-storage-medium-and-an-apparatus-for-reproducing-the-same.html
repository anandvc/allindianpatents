Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to embodknents of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
An optical information storage medkim according to an embodiment of the present invention is a read-only optical information storage medium. The optical information storage medium is divided into a plurality of areas according to function or use purpose. A recording modulation method or a recording pattern used in a portion of the plurality of<br><br>
areas is different from a recording modulation method or a recording pattern used in the "emaining portion of the plurality of areas.<br>
As described above, the optical information storage medium is divided into a alurality of areas according to function or use. For example, as shown in FIG. 1 , the optical information storage medium includes a BCA 10, a lead-in area 20, a user data area 30, and a lead-out area 40. Also, data is recorded as pits everywhere on the optical information storage medium. In other words, data is recorded as pits in the BCA 10, the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40. Thus, the read-only optical information storage medium is consistent with a recordable optical information storage medium in that data is recorded as groove wobbles everywhere on the recordable optical information storage medium.<br>
Information on a serial number of the optical information storage medium or information indicating the BCA 10 is recorded as pits in the BCA 10. Disc-related (or optical information storage medium-related) information, copy protection information, and so forth are recorded in the lead-in area 20. For example, the disc-related information includes information on the type of a storage medkvn such as a recordable cisc, write-one dfec, or a read-only disc, infomation on the nurnber of recording layers, information on tie recording speed, and information on the size of the disc.<br>
On an optical information storage medium to an embodiment of the present invention, patterns of pits formed in or recording modulation methods used in the BCA 10, the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40 are different.<br>
The different patterns of the pits formed in the BCA 10, the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40 wM be described. For example, the pattern of pits formed in the BCA 10 may be different from the patterns of pits formed hi the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40. Here, the pattern of the pits formed in the BCA 10 may be a straight ptt row or a ptt wobble. A straight pit row has pits arranged in a straight row and a pit wobble has pte arranged In a waveform.<br>
The pattern of the straight ptt row and the ptt wobble may be a single pattern, a specific pattern, or a random pattern. The single pattern refers to a pattern in which pits of length nT are arranged at regular intervals. Here, n denotes a natural number and T denotes the minimum pit length. For example, as shown in FIG 2A, the single pattern of the straight pit row refers to pits of the same length arranged in a straight row. As shown in FIG. 2B, the single pattern of the pit wobble refers to pits of the same length arranged in a waveform.<br>
The specific pattern indicates that a sequence of pits of different lengths is repeated For example, a sequence of pits of lengths 3T and 6T may be repeated.  Here, a sync pattern may have pits of length 9T. As shown in FIG. 2C, the specific pattern of the straight pit row refers to specific pits arranged in a straight row. As shown in FIG. 2D, the specific pattern of the pit wobble refers to specific pits arranged in a waveform.<br>
The random pattern refers to pits of different lengths arranged at irregular intervals. For example, as shown in FIG. 2E, the random pattern of the straight pit row refers to pits of different lengths arranged in a straight row at random. As shown in FIG. 2F, the random pattern of the pit wobble refers to pits of different lengths arranged in a waveform at random.<br>
Pits are formed in one of the single, specific, and random patterns of the straight pit row, and the single, specific, and random patterns of the pit wobble in the BCA10. Pits are formed in a different pattern from that used in the BCA 10 in the lead-in area 20 and the user data area 30.<br>
In detail, as shown in FIG. 3A, pits are formable in the single pattern of the straight pit rows in the BCA 10, and in ttie random pattern of tie straight pit rows in the lead-in area 20 and the user data area 30. As shown in FK3L 3B, pits may be formed in the specific pattern of the straight pit rows in the BCA 10, and in the random pattern of the straight pit rows in thetead-in area 20 and the user data area 30. As another example, as shown in FIG. 3C, pits may be formed in the signal pattern of the straight pH rows in the BCA 10, and in the random pattern of the pit wobble in the lead-in area 20 and the user data area 30. In particular, in the case of the random pattern of the pit wobble, as shown in FIG. 3D, an amplitude of pit wobbles may gradually decrease or increase.<br>
Here, a tracking servo for read-only data is generally performed according to a differential phase detect (DPD) method. The DPD method is known, and thus a detailed description thereof is omitted. If read-only data is recorded in the single pattern, a DPD signal is not detected. Thus, in this case, the DPD method cannot be used. However, in the present embodiment, information recorded in the BCA is read using only a focusing servo. Therefore, the DPD method does not affect the BCA 10. In other words, as shown in FIGS. 3A, 3C, and 3D, although pits are formed in the single pattern in the BCA 10, It is not necessary to use the tracking servo. As a result date is readable from the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40, but not the BCA 10, using the DPD method.<br>
As another example, pits are formable in the random pattern of the straight pit row in the BCA 10, and in the random pattern of the straight pit row or the random pattern of the pit wobble in the lead-in area 20 and the user data area 30. Alternatively, pits may be formed in the random pattern of the straight pit row in the BCA 10, and in the random pattern of the pit wobble in the lead-in area 20 or the user data area 30. Here, if pits are formed in the random pattern in the BCA 10, the pattern of the pits may be a "OOh" pattern or a pattern containing information for representing the BCA 10.<br>
Also, pits are formable in different pit patterns in the BCA 10, the lead-in area 20, and the user data area 30. For example, as shown in FIG. 4A, pits are formable in the single pattern of the straight pit row in the BCA 10, in the random pattern of the straight pit row in the lead-in area 20, and in the random pattern of the pit wobble in the user data area 30. Alternatively, as shown in FIG 4B, pits are formable in the specific pattern of the straight pit row in the BCA 10, in the random pattern of the pit wobble in the lead-in area 20, and in the random pattern of the straight pit row in the user data area 30.<br>
Different recording modulation methods used in the BCA 10, the lead-in area 20, and the user data area 30 will now be explained.<br>
A recording modulation method used in the BCA 10 is a RLL (d, k) modulation method or a bi-phase modulation method and a different recording modulation method is<br>
used in the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-in area 40.<br>
Bi-phase modulation refers to a method of displaying data depending on whether a signal varies within a predetermined period P. For example, as shown in FIG. 5A, when the phase of a groove wobble, does not change within a predetermined period P, a bit value "0" is read. When the phase of the groove wobble changes within the predetermined period P, a bit value "1" is read. In other words, the bi-phase modulation method is a method of recording data depending on whether a signal varies within a given period, e.g., depending on whether the phase of a signal changes within a given period. Here, modulation of the phase of a groove wobble has been described, but various patterns may be modulated.<br>
As shown in FIG 5B, If a pit does not change within a given period P, a bit of value "0"(or "1") is read, and if the pit changes within the given period P, a bit of value "1" (or "0") Is read. In other words, if a pit is formed everywhere within the given period P, a bit of value "0" (or "1") is read, and if a pit and a space are formed within the given period P, a bit of value "1" (or "0") is read.<br>
The RLL modulation method indicates how many bits of value "0" exist between two bits of value "1". Here, RLL (d, k) indicates that the minimum number and the maximum number of bits of value "0" between two bits of value "1" are d and k, respectively. For example, in a RLL (1, 7) modulation method, the minimum number and the maximum number of bits of value "0" between two bits of value "1" are 1 and 7, respectively. According to the RLL (1, 7) modulation method, when d=1, data of "1010101" is recorded and thus a mark of length 2T is formed between two bits of value "1". Also, when d=7, data of "10000000100000001" is recorded and thus a mark of length 8T is formed between two bits of value "1". Here, T denotes the minimum mark length, i.e., the minimum pit length. Thus, in the RLL (1, 7) modulation method, data is recorded as marks and spaces of length 2T to 8T.<br>
As described in the above example, the recording modulation method used in the BCA10 is different from the recording modulation methods used in the lead-in area 20, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40. Alternatively, the recording modulation method used in the lead-in area 20 may be different from the recording modulation methods used in the BCA tO, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40. For example, the recording modulation method used in the lead-in area 20 may be the RLL (d, k) modulation method or the bi-phase method, and the recording modulation method used in the BCA 10, the user data area 30, and the lead-out area 40 may be different from the recording modulation method used in the lead-in area 20.<br>
A track pitch of the pits formed in the BCA 10 may be equal to or different from a track pitch of the pits formed in the lead-in area 20 and/or the user data area 30.<br>
An optical information storage medium according to another embodiment of the present invention is divided into a plurality of areas according to function or use. A pit pattern or a recording modulates method used hi a portion of the plurality of areas is different from pit patterns or recording modulation methods used in the remaining portion of the plurality of areas.<br>
For example, the lead-in area 20 may be divided into a plurality of sub-areas. In other words, as shown in FIG6, when the lead-in area 20 is divided into a first area 20a and a second area 20b, pits may be formed in different pit patterns or according to different modulation methods in the first area 20a and the second area 20b. Pits are formed in the single, specific, or random pattern of the straight pit rows, or the single, specific, or random pattern of the pit wobbles in the first area 20a. Pits are formed in a pattern different from that in the first area 20a, in the second area 205.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. /A, pits are formable in the random pattern of the straight pit rows in the first area 20a, and in the random pattern of the pit wobbles in the second area 20b. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 7B, pits are formable in the specific sattem of the straight pit rows in the first area 20a, and in the random pattern of the straight pit rows in the second area 20b.<br>
Furthermore, the pit pattern used in the first area 20a or the second area 20b may be different from the pit patterns used in the BCA 10 and the user data area 30. For example, as shown in FIG 8A, pits are formed in the single pattern of the straight pit rows in the BCA 10, in the specific pattern of the straight pit rows in the first area 20a, and in the random pattern of the straight pit rows in the second area 20b and the user data area 30. As shown in FIG. 8B, pits are formable in the single pattern of the straight pit rows in the BCA 10, in the random pattern of the straight pit rows in the first area 20a, in the specific pattern of the straight pit rows in the second area 20b, and in the random pattern of the pit wobbles in the user data area 30.<br>
As another example, the user data area 30 is dividabte into two or more sub-areas. Pits may be formed in different pit patterns in the sub-areas, or the pit patterns used in the sub-areas may be different from a pit pattern used in the BCA 10 or the lead-in area 20. Also, different recording modulation methods are usable in the sub-areas, or the recording modulation methods used in toe sub-areas may be different from a recording modulation method used in the BCA 10 or the lead-in area 20.<br>
Meanwhile, when data is recorded in the user data area 30 (shown in FIG6), as shown in FIG. 9, the data is recorded in each of basic recording units 33. Run-ins 31 and run-outs 35 are located before and after the basic recording units 33. Here, the basic recording units 33 may be physical dusters, sectors, ECC blocks, frames, or the like. The run-ins 31 and the run-outs 35 are for accurately reproducing data in the basic recording units 33. In other words, if data is recorded in the run-ins 31 or the runouts 35 in slightly the wrong position, the run-ins 31 and the run-outs 35 corrects the error so that data is effectively recorded and/or reproduced.<br>
Pits are formable in the run-ins 31 and the run-outs 35 in the same pit pattern as that used in the user data area 30. For example, when pits are formed in the random pattern of the straight pit row or the random pattern of the pit wobble in the user data area 30, pits are also formed in the random pattern of the straight pit row or the random pattern of the pit wobble in the run-ins 31 and the run-outs 35. As an example of the random<br>
pattern, "00h" is recordable, As shown in FIG. 9, pits may be recorded as "00h" in the run-ins 31, the basic recording units 33, and the run-outs 35,<br>
In the meantime, pits may be formed in the run-ins 31 and the run-outs 35 in a different pit pattern from the user data area 30.<br>
Data is recordable in a portion of at least one of a plurality of areas of an optical information storage medium using a different recording modulation method from the remaining areas of the optical storage medium.<br>
For example, data is recordable in the first area 20a according to the RLL (d, k) modulation method and in the second area 20b according to the bi-phase modulation method. Alternatively, data is recordable in the first area 20a according to the bi-phase modulation method, and in the second area 20b, the BCA10, and the user data area 30 according to the RLL (d, k) modulation method. In contrast, data is recordable in the first area 20a according to the RLL (d, k) modulation method, and in the second area 20b, the BCA 10, and the user data area 30 according to the bi-phase modulation method.<br>
Referring to FIG 10, there is shown a schematic view of recording/reading unit 100 which records to and reads from an optical storage medium such as, by way of non-limiting examples, a CD or a DVD.<br>
The recording/reading unit 100 includes a light source 101 for recording and reproducing information onto and from optical storage medium 300. The recording/reading unit 100 also includes a beam splitter 102 ts arranged on a path of the beam emitted from the light source 101 and then reflected from the beam splitter 102 toward the optical storage medium 300, and a objective lens 104 for spotting the beams reflected from the beam splitter 102.<br>
The recording/reading unit 10 further includes a photodiode 105 for detecting recorded information and an error from the beams reflected from the optical storage medium.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown a block diagram of a recording/reproducing system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus includes a recording/reading unit 10 and a controller 20. The recording/reading unit 10 writes data to and/or reproduces data from a write once recording medium 30 that is an information storage medium.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention is applicable to an optical information storage medium having wo or more recording layers as well as to an optical information storage medium having a single recording layer. In other words, the present invention is applicable to each ecording layer of a multi-layer optical information storage medium.<br>
As described above, an optical information storage medium, recording/reproducing nethod, and a recording/reproducing apparatus according to the described embodiments ensures compatibility with a drive by prescribing a pit pattern or a recording modulation nethod used in a BCA, not in a data area. As a result, data reproduction efficiency can be improved and the optical information storage medium can be used conveniently. In addition, the optical information storage medium can maintain consistency with the format of a recordable optical information storage medium.<br>
