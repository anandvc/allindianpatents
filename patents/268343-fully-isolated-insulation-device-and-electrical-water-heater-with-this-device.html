				<td>FULLY ISOLATED INSULATION DEVICE AND ELECTRICAL WATER HEATER<br>
WITH THIS DEVICE<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the improvement of an insulation device, and also relates to an electrical water heater with this device. It belongs to the technical field of household electrical appliances.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
The insulation performance of household electrical appliances has for a long time been a question concerned and studied by people. The national standard GB 4706.1 "Safety for electrical appliances for household and similar use" has set forth detailed stipulations on the safety requirements for household electrical appliances. In our retrieval, it was found that the China Patent of Invention with the application No. 031062628 has made public an insulation assembly and the electrical water heater fitted with this insulation assembly, and the insulation assembly consists of the support for insulated object I, the support for insulated object II, insulation mat, connector and insulation sleeve. The insulation mat is provided between the support for insulated object I and object II, the said insulation sleeve is put on the connector, and the support for insulated object I, insulation mat, object II and the support for insulated object II are connected in sequence by this connector.<br>
An electrical water heater with this insulation structure can prevent current from conducting to the housing of the water heater (or wall) in the event of internal current leakage (or when a part becomes live), therefore avoiding a danger to the user. However, it has been shown by theoretical analysis and instrument testing that, although the connectors (usually screws) in this insulation assembly on the external surface of the electrical water heater are isolated from the housing of the electrical water heater by means of the insulation sleeve, their internal ends are in direct connection and contact with the container and its supports of the electrical water heater. Therefore, in the event of internal current leakage (or when a part becomes live), there is still the possibility of electric shock to the user when the exposed end of a connector is contacted by accident, hence it is not possible to ensure safety theoretically.<br>
Content of Invention<br>
The objective of the present invention is, with respect to the defects of the prior art, to purpose a fully isolated insulation device that not only allows insulation of the two connected<br><br>
niWnbers, but also ensures insulation of the connectors from the connected members. The present invention has also presented an electrical water heater with this device, to realize insulation of all exposed parts from internal members, thus ensuring safety in use.<br>
It has become aware to the inventors of the present invention in the experiments and researches that, the key to the above-mentioned objective is to find a way to avoid any conducting connection in the connection structure of the two connected members, in addition to realizing the insulation isolation between the two connected members.<br>
On the basis of this recognition, the present invention proposes a fully isolated insulation device as follows: this device consists of a first connected member adjacent to a live part, a external second connected member, a isolation insulator between the two connected members and connectors, with the improvement that the said isolation insulator at least insulates and isolates the first connected member from the connector, the said connector passes through the first connected member, isolation insulator and second connected member to fix and connect them together.<br>
The further embodiment of the invention is: the said isolation insulator consists of the upper and lower parts, the upper part is an isolation mat with a hole in the center, and a nut enveloping the connector is located at the central hole of the lower part. When assembled, the upper part is located between the first and second connected members, the lower.part isolates the first connected member from the connector, the bolt of the connector is inserted from the second connected member for tightening by the nut, to fix and connect the first and second connected member together.<br>
In this way, even if the first connected member becomes live accidentally due to current leakage, no external parts fixed and connected with it, including the second connected member and the connector, will become live thanks to the isolating function of the isolation insulator, therefore ensuring full safety. Compared with the prior art, the present invention has eliminated any possibility of current leakage to the outside theoretically, and can be used to fully meet the requirements of safety standards for household electrical appliances; therefore it has outstanding substantial characteristics and represents obvious progress.<br>
An electrical water heater of fully isolated insulation with this invention device consists of a container adjacent to an electrical heating element, a housing on the container, a isolation insulator between the container and housing and fastening connectors, the said isolation insulator at least insulates and isolates the container from the fastening connector, and the said<br><br>
fastening connector passes through the container, isolation insulator and housing to fix and connect them together.<br>
With the action of the isolation insulator, the container and all exposed parts and elements including the housing and fastening connectors are mutually insulated, therefore even in case of current leakage from the heating element, no exposed part or element of the electrical water heater will become live, thus ensuring safety in use. Furthermore, as the insulation materials are usually poor conductors of heat, in an electrical water heater with the structure of the present invention, the heat conducting bridges between the container and the exposed parts and elements are also isolated, thus greatly reducing the heat conducting and dissipating from the container, and favorable to increasing the heating speed and heat efficiency of the electrical water heater. The present invention thus has the beneficial effect of killing two birds with one stone.<br>
Description of drawings<br>
These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be further described in the following with preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is the structure schematic of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged structure schematic of the isolation insulator in the embodiment in Fig. 1.<br>
Preferred embodiment<br>
Embodiment<br>
This embodiment is an electrical water heater with a fully isolated insulation device, as shown in Fig. 1, electrical heating bars (not shown) are fitted in the enamel container 6 of the water heater, a M-shaped support is welded on the external surface of container 6, forming the first connected member adjacent to the live element. On the external surface of housing cylinder 3 outside the container is fitted the housing bracket 2 for mounting the electrical water heater, forming the second connected member in the exterior. The isolation insulator 5 made of nylon is located between the two connected members, and insulates and isolates the container from bolt 1 and nut as fastening connector by its own isolating function from container support 4, while isolating the container from the housing. The bolt 1 of the fastening connector passes through the housing (2 and 3), isolation insulator 5 and container support 4 of the container , to lock with the nut to fix and connect the above-mentioned parts and components. The remaining gaps between container 6 and housing cylinder 3 are filled with foam thermal<br><br>
insulation materials, to further improve the effect of thermal insulation and also to enhance the electrical insulation.<br>
To facilitate assembling, isolation insulator 5 is made as a structure of upper and lower parts linked together as shown in Fig. 2. The upper part is an isolation mat with turned edges and a hole in the center, the nut 1' of the connector is enveloped at the central hole in the lower part, a locating and isolating boss is provided at the upper mouth of the central hole, and the extension on one side of the lower part is connected as a whole with one side of the upper part. This not only facilitates assembling, but also simplifies the forming process. When assembled, the gap between the upper and lower parts of isolation insulator 5 is clipped on container support 4, with the locating and isolating boss in the lower part inlaid and located in the hole of container support 4 and the upper part located between the housing 3 and container support 4. When bolt 1 is inserted into the parts, it can be easily screwed and fastened with the nut, to fix and connect the housing with the container. It can be easily seen that isolation insulator 5 has realized in a reliable manner the insulation and isolation between the housing and container and between fastening and connecting bolt and nut and the container, therefore it can be ensured that, in the event of current leakage from the electrical heating element during the use of the electrical water heater, no exposed part or component, including the housing and fastening connectors, will become live.<br>
It should be noted that, the above-mentioned embodiment is not limiting to the invention. The present invention can have other forms of embodiments in addition to the above embodiment. For example, this fully isolated insulation device can also be used in other household electrical appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines; the isolation insulator can also be in split form, and further insulation structure with the second connected member can be provided; various insulation materials can be selected for the isolation insulator; the connector can be in other forms such as rivet, in addition to bolts and nuts. Any modification in the form of identical substitution or equivalent conversion shall fall within the scope of protection required by the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
