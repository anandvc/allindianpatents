MULTI-COMPARTMENT CONTAINER<br>
	ASSEMBLY SYSTEM	<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a multi-compartment container assembly system for storing each of two or more components of a formulation separately in individual containers  until ready for mixing prior to use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The container assembly system of the present invention provides a container Isystem that allows the user to store multiple components of a formulation in separate individual containers that can be assembled easily into a single multi-compartment container which can store the multiple components separated until they are ready for use at jwhich time the components may then be mixed lo form the formulation just prior to use iThe container assembly system may consist of two basic types of assembly units; a dispensing unit, and a cartridge unit. Each of these units are separate containers that may be assembled together readily to form a single multi-compartment container with each of the assembly units forming a separate compartment.<br>
For example, a dispensing-unit and a cartridge unit may be assembled,<br><br>
together to form a two-compartment container system. And by piggy-backing;o'ne-'or:m6re<br>
cartridge units to the first cartridge unit in;series, additional compartoents may be auided.'<br>
, Each additional cartridge unit may contain a different component of a formulation in any <br>
predetermined quantity. Furthermore, a multi-compartment container may be assembled by<br>
connecting multiple cartridge units only without using any dispensing unit. In such<br>
embodiment a suitable dispensing device may be attached to the top opening of the first.<br>
cartridge unit if necessary.<br>
It is to be appreciated that because ihe number and size of the dispensing unit and the cartridge units may be varied in unlimited combinations, this assembly system provides the flexibility of allowing the user to prepare varying quanti ties of a given formulation as well as to prepare a complex-formulation, with multiple components of varying quantities. Each of the assembly units may be provided in various sizes to accommodate different quantities of each component of a formulation where appropriate.-<br>
Another advantage of using jthe multi-compartment container system of this invention over the prior art multicompartment containers is that the system provides longer storage-life for the components of a formulation and in most applications there is no need foj special storage conditions of ihe system-.'and/or components such as refrigeration. Because each component of a multi-component formulation may be stored in separately<br><br>
.sealed.containers, the components of aljpnnulation maybe stored for a lohgerperibds<br>
1 without concerns of accidental mixing.<br><br>
A dispensing unit may bea container for storing a component of a <br>
 formulation with an opening at each end of the container body. The bottom end of the J dispensing unit may be adapted and configured to engage a cartridge unit in order to | assemble a multi-compartment container. The top end of the dispensing unit may be<br>
. j adapted :and configured to engage a dispensing device such as a nozzle or a nipple of a . suitable material for a baby feeding bottle, or a dosage device, etc. As will be later I disclosed herein, the cartridge unit maybe adapted and configured to engage the top'or bottom ends of the dispensing unit.<br>
y	Both ends of the dispensing unit may typically be sealed so that-the.  ■<br>
jdispensing unit's content can be protected from any contamination during storage. And<br>
■	: ■ •	'<br>
Ibecause these seals must be removed iniorder to assemble the multi-compartment assembly<br>
land dispense the contents, the seals are preferably configured to be readily removed or<br>
fcroken, e.g., a breakable or peelable seal;"The breakable or peelable seal may comprise a<br>
jmembrane where the membrane may be ;a foil or a non-metallic membrane, such:as a ptestic<br>
'or other polymer membrane, and may have a single-layer or a multi-layered laminate-1 <br>
 structure; Sucrrmembrane seal-may be heat sealed along the rims of the dispensing unit's. <br>
open end's so that it may be peeled .off to!"engage a cartridge unit or to attach an appropriate..<br>
dispensing system. The seal may further comprise a screw-on or pressure closing cap;<br>
A cartridge unit is another container for storing another component of the:<br>
formulation with an opening at each of its top and bottom ends of the container. The top.<br>
open end of the cartridge unit may be adapted and configured to sealingly engage, the :<br>
bottom opening of the dispensing unit in order to assemble a two-compartment container.<br><br>
To form a two-compartment container, the top end of the cartridge unit is inserted into the<br>
flange portion of the dispensing unit thereby each assembly units form a separate cpmpartment of the resulting container. To form the seal between the assembly units, the outer surfaces near the top open end of the cartridge unit may be provided with one or more sealing ridges. The sealing ridges form fluid-tight seals with the inside wall surfaces of the ■ bottom opening of the dispensing unit when* the cartridge unit is inserted into the bottom opening :of the dispensing unit.<br>
I	The top open end of the cartridge unit also may be provided with a joining -<br>
sleeve that is provided with one or more additional sealing ridges that engages the bottom opening of the dispensing unit.<br>
.1	Within the cartridge unit is provided a sealing wall that forms a fluid-tight<br><br>
seal at or near the top open end of the cartridge unit, sealing the top open end. The sealing<br><br>
wall is movable between a sealed position,1 whereby the seal is formed, and an unsealed<br><br>
1<br>
 position, whereby the inside of the cartridge unit is in flow-communication vrith the, - ; dispensing unit through the top open end<br>
The cartridge unit further.may be provided with a displaceablemember to<br>
	move the sealing wall from its sealed position to its unsealed position. In addition., or<br>
 alternatively, the displaceable member may move the sealing wall to its sealed position.<br>
The sealing wall may be provided at one; end of the displaceable member and amanipulable<br>
■	portion may be provided at the other end;'<br>
The bottom open end of the cartridge unit may be adapted and configured to securely hold the displaceable member in the sealed position until the sealing:wall has to be moved to the unsealed position in order to mix the contents of the cartridge urdt thus &gt;  functioning as a security mechanism for preventing unintentional unsealing of the sealing wall.<br>
Displaceable member has the sealing wall at top end and a scalable filling .opening near the bottom open end. Additional cartridge units may be piggy-backed to the bottom end of the displaceable member iii series to form a multi-compartment container. In ; :this. configuration, the bottom end of thedisplaceable member of the first cartridge unit and ■■ the top end of the second cartridge unit engage each other to form a fluid-tight, seal so that<br>
■	each cartridge unit may form a compartment of a multi-compartment container.<br>
.In one embodiment of the'invention, a multi-compartment container<br>
.  assembly system has a dispensing unit having- a housing and an opening at each of its top '<br>
*<br>
,   and bottom ends. The bottom end of the dispensing unit may have a flange portion for<br>
engaging a cartridge unit. In this embodiment, a cartridge unit having a cartridge housing<br>
and openings at each of its top and bottom ends is also provided. A sealing wall is disposed<br>
within the cartridge housing capable of forming a fluid-tight seal at or near the top opening<br>
of the cartridge housing, the sealing wall being movable between two positions. In its first<br>
position the sealing wall forms a fluid-tigfrt seal with the cartridge housing, and in its<br>
second unsealed position, a flow-communication is established with the inside of the<br>
cartridge unit through the top opening of the cartridge housing. A displaceable member<br>
provided within the cartridge housing to move the sealing wall between the sealed position<br>
ajid the unsealed position. The displaceable member has a side wall that sealingty engages<br>
the inside wall of the cartridge housing in "a; fluid-right manner, and has a manipulate<br>
portion at its bottom end for manipulating'the displaceable member between the two<br>
positions. It is to be appreciated that the dispensing unit may be adapted and configured to<br>
se.alingly engage a cartridge unit on either or both ends thereof, as will be further .described<br>
herein&gt;e!ow.	;'<br>

:":'/.	(h) sealing the sealable filling openings.<br>
Once the dispensing units and the cartridge units are prepared arid;sealed;   : .'; they can be stored for extended periods of.time until they are ready to be assembled into a ■• single multi-compartment containers to mix the contents of each units into a formulation.<br>
In. another embodiment of the present invention, only one or more cartridge units, without any dispensing units, maybe filled and then sealed to be stored and:. assembled into a multi-compartment container just prior to use.<br>
After the user has assembled'the filled assembly units into a multi-' compartment container and mixed and dispensed Ihe contents of the container, the assembly units can be reused. The assembly units may be disassembled and then refilled. The refilling process would be same as the processes described above.<br>
The empty assembled multi-compartment container may also be filled and   ■ sealed in its assembled state. An example of a such refilling process where the assembled multi-compartment container comprises a. dispensing unit and two cartridge units will now be described. With all the assembly units inilow-communication with each other,'the interior of the multi-compartment container is first rinsed and cleaned using suitable cleaning agents. After .the interior of the multi-compartment container is sufficiently dried, each of the Assembly units forming the multircompaament container may be refilled by first mtroducmg:a first component of a formulation into the bottom-most cartridge unit: through<br>
j	;	'   I	;<br>
i<br><br>
: the dispensing unit's top opening. The first component of the formulation will travel ,-: \ through each of the compartments corresponding to each of the assembly units, until it ; ; reaches the bottom cartridge unit. The bottom cartridge unit is then sealed by moving its ;. displaceable member into its sealed position. With, the bottom-most cartridge unit filled and ' ! sealed, the remaining interior of .the multi-companment is rinsed, cleaned, and.dried again : so that any remnants of the first component of the formulation is removed.<br>
Next, a second component of the formulation is introduced into-ithe multicompartment container assembly through the dispensing unit's top opening. The second ; component will travel down through the assembly until it reaches the second cartridge unit  [ ;that is above the bottom-most cartridge unit. This second cartridge unit is then sealed by -j ;moving its displaceable member into its sealed position. With the second cartridge unit ^filled and sealed, the interior of the dispensing unit is rinsed, cleaned, and dried again to ;remove any remnants of the second component of the formulation.<br>
Next, a third component of the formulation is introduced into the'dispensing<br>
unit through the dispensing unit's top opening. The top opening may then be sealed with a<br>
-  suitable sealing member. The multi-compartment container is now ready to be used again<br>
• br stored until ready, for use.<br>
■ !   .	■ i   It would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the-art that the process of   ■<br>
tefilling.a:multi-compartment assembly that'comprises two or more of cartridgeainits; :\ ..without any dispensing units would follow the same process steps as described above until   .;   ■ I  the top-most assembly unit is reached,. :in this example, since the top-most assembly unit is   ; . a cartridge unit, it would be sealed by moving its displaceable member to its sealed position<br>
after a component of the formulation is introduced into its interior.<br>
i	■<br>
:	' Furthermore, the assembly-units, according to the present invention, maybe<br>
pre-assembled into a multi-compartment container and then stored as an assembly until the . contents of each units are ready to be mixed into a formulation. It is to be appreciated; that in the assembled state, each dispensing unit and one or more cartridge units forrri separate compartments of the multi-compartment container preventing the contents of each units from mixing prematurely.<br>
|	i The invention will now be illustrated in some specific embodiments directed<br>
to a two and three-compartment container assemblies fitted with a baby feeding nipple as the dispensing device. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the same principle is also applicable to form containers with additional separate components, and containers for other applications and areas where it is desired to store components of ; multiple-component formulations separately in individual containers and then assemble the individual assembly units into a single multi-compartment container which wall store the<br><br>
.: components separately in such multi-compartment containers which may latex-be mixedto |. form and'dispense the formulation.      I iBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT<br>
;  .	Some ^examples of the multi-compartment containers are provided to<br>
illustrate various specific configurations and examples of the invention. The invention should not be regarded as being limited to these embodiments. The containers may also be used for different uses, e.g., two or more compartment containers for medicinal formulations, dietary powders to be reconstituted with a liquid, alcoholic beverages to form cocktails with other ingredients or variousnon-alcoholic beverages that are prepared from powders wherein one compartment contains one component and the other compartment contains, another component to be mixed.fo form a formulation.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a dispensing unit 10 with a body 12 and a top opening 16 ai?da bottom opening 18, Body 12 may be provided with a flange portion 14 at:the bottom end.of body 12 for receiving and engagingwith a cartridge unit 30 shown in Fig. 2. Near thp top opening of dispensing unit-10, a suitable mechanism for attaching an appropriate<br>
&gt;<br><br>
'dispensing device or a cartridge unit may be provided. For illustrative purposed, in this.. : embodiment dispensing unit 10 is:provided with a screw thread 19 for threadabty attaching' a dispensing device or a cartridge unit.<br>
Dispensing unit 10 may fee.filled with a component of a formulation which I may typically be a liquid, a powdered substance, a gel. etc. During the storage;of the • dispensing unit 10, the top and bottom openings 16,18 may be sealed to prevent ; contamination or spoilage of the contents of the dispensing unit. Openings 16 and 18 may : be sealed, with-membranes 20 and 22 (see Fig. 3) respectively or with other suitable sealing ^methods (e.g., screw caps). The seals axe preferably readily removable or peelable so that a multicompartment container maybe assembled to mix and dispense a formulation.<br>
Sealing membranes 20 and 22 may be a foil or a non-metallic membrane,. and may have a single or a multi-layered structure. The membranes are preferably heat sealed to the dispensing unit in such a manner that they may be peeled off. Fig; la illustrates an example of a membrane 20.sealing the top opening of dispensing unit 10.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a cartridge unit 30 which may be engaged with; a dispensing unit 10 to form a two-compartment container Cartridge unit 30 has a housing 50 with a top  ' opening 32 formed by a joining sleeve 34. When cartridge unit 30 and dispensing unit 10 axe assembled, joining sleeve 34 is inserted into flange portion 14 of dispensing'unit 10. The outer surface of joining sleeve 34 may be provided with one or more sealing ridges 36 that produces a friction-fitting joint-with the inside wall of flange portion 14 to form a fluid-\  tight seal.<br>
1	Near top opening 32 of cartridge unit 30 is a scalable opening 35 'that can be<br>
sealed with a displaceable sealing wall 64; Displaceable sealing wall 64 can be displaced between a sealed position, sealing sealable opening 35 and an unsealed position,; in which sealable opening 35 is open. Near the bottom end 50b of the cartridge housing, a security ring 42 is connected to the rest of the housing structure by a seal tamper prevention ribbon 38. Seal tamper prevention ribbon 38 is provided with a pull-tab 40 for removing: the ribbon in order to detach security ring 42 from the rest of the cartridge housing. As described in more detail below, security ring 42 mechanically prevents accidental or unwanted displacement of sealing wall 64 from sealed position to an unsealed position. Other suitable mechanical means for preventing accidental displacement of the cartridge : unit and preventing tampering therewith may be used, for example, external shrink sleeves (fiot shown).<br>
I	Fig- 3 illustrates cartridge unit 30 and dispensing unit 10 in their sealed<br>
cojifiguratibn,.each holding a component of a formulation. Dispensing unit 10 of Kg. 1 is<br>

The housing has a joining sleeve 34 at the top end for ; engaging a dispensing unit, such as dispensing unit 10 illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, or another. ' • cartridge unit when used to piggy-back onto another cartridge unit to assemble a multi-; compartment container. Provided on the outer surface of joining sleeve 34 are one or more sealing ridges 36 that will form a fluid-tight seal with the inside wall of flange 14 of ;dispensing unit 10 when the wo units are assembled together to form a two-compartment j container.<br>
Although Fig. 4 illustrates an embodiment of the cartridge unit haying a neck<br>
portion 51, it would be appreciated that a cartridge unit may not have a neck portion<br>
delineating joining sleeve 34 and the rest of the cartridge housing. The joining sleeve may<br>
have the same diameter as the rest of the cartridge housing without any neck portion.<br>
|	Inwardly projecting frommeck portion 51 is an annular engagemenfimember<br>
' '60 formed with a downwardly-facing groove 61 (see Fig. 5) which cooperates with an annular projection 62, projecting from a sealing wall 64 of a displaceable member 44, to   • form a fluid-tight seal that closes opening 35. Annular projection 62 may be fabricated of. elastomeric materials to enhance sealing.- In Fig. 4, displaceable member 44 is'in the; sealed ' position.<br>
Displaceable member 44 is provided within container housing 50.-and has a user manipulable portion 41 for axially displacing the displaceable member between a sealed position, where sealing wall 64 engages annular engagement member 60 closing opening 35 in a fluid-tight manner, and an unsealed position, where sealing wall 64 is disengaged from annular engagement member 60 allowing a flow-communication between inside chamber. 80 of the cartridge unit and the outside environment through opening 35. Displaceable member 44 is connected to sealing wall 64 via one or more connecting<br>
member 48.<br>

;	In a typical intended use, a dispensing unit 10 would be engaged to top end ..<br>
of a cartridge unit 30 whereby the dispensing unit and the cartridge unit form the upper and :<br>
: lower, compartments of a two-compartment container assembly respectively. The" two-<br>
compartment container maybe assembled without breaking the seal formed by sealing wall •<br>
6^ and may be used to store the components in assembled fashion and later controllably<br>
remove the seal to mix the components to form the formulation. Thus, disengaging sealing<br>
wall 64 from annular engagement member 60 would allow a flow-communication between<br>
the upper and lower compartments,	i<br>
i	'•'-..■<br><br>
Displaceable member 44;fuxther has an annular rim 66 defining^ajsealable .filling opening 67, at the bottom end of cartridge unit 30, that provides access tainside chamber 80 of the cartridge unit. Sealable filling opening 67 may be sealed with a closure :memb.er 68. In a typical use, after displaceable member 44 is positioned inside-the cartridge ■housing in the sealed position sealing the opening 35, the cartridge unit's inside, chamber 80 may be filled with a component of a formulation through sealable filling opening 67 on the bottom side of the displaceable member./ Sealable filling opening 67 may then: be sealed with closure member 68. Closure member 68 may be a membrane sealed to annular rim 66 ■ by a suitable sealing method such as heat-sealing or threaded or pressure fitted cap (not shown)., As discussed above in reference to sealing membrane 20 of dispensing unit 10, closure member 68 also may be a foil or'a non-metallic membrane having a single or multi-layered structure. Alternatively, the displaceable member may be configured so that'the bottom sealable filling opening is seale&amp;'and displaceable member 44 is positioned inside the cartridge housing in the unsealed position so that the cartridge unit may be filled through . unsealed opening 35 and then moving the displaceable member to seal opening 35.<br>
Displaceable member 44 'further has a side wall portion 46 which threadably engages-cartridge housing 50 to enable manipulation of displaceable member 44 between a ■ sealed position and an unsealed positiomby turning manipulate portion 41. A thread structure 56 is provided on the inside surface of housing 50 and the displaceable member's   ■ mating thread structure 58 (see Fig. 5) is-provided on the outside surface of side wall portion 46. To move the displaceable member into its unsealed position, displaceable member 44 is rotated (typically in a counter-clockwise direction) using manipulable portion 41 so that the two thread structures 56 and 58 unscrew. This motion displaces the displaceable member 44 downwardly along the longitudinal axis of the cartridge: unit so that the annular projection 62 disengages from annular engagement member 60 to establish a flow-communication between the cartridge unit's inside chamber 80 and the outside environment through opening 35.<br>
As illustrated, displaceable?: member 44 preferably may be provided-with additional sealing ridges 52 and 54 that sealably contact the inside surface of cartridge housing 50. These sealing ridges preferably form liquid-tight seals so that the mixed liquid formulation does not leak when displaceable member 44 is in the unsealed position as illustrated in Fig. 5. These seals, however, can be fabricated of elastomeric materials to enhance sealing and preferably are air-peipneable so that, in a fully assembled multi-compartment container assembly, as the displaceable member is being unsealed the temporary vacuum condition created at the seal between annular engagement member- 60 and annular projection 62 can draw in air from outside the container. The temporary-<br>
i	'.<br><br>
■ " vacuum condition may make it difficult for the end user to unseal the displace;4£le member<br>
:'■ (iii extreme cases the vacuum may prevent the displaceable member from being;lowered altogether) or can distort and warp the container. But, the air-permeable seal provided by sealing ridges 52 and 54 allow air to be introduced into the container during thej unsealing step equalizing the air pressure between the inside and outside of the container.,'This allows dispJaceable member 44 to be displaced into its unsealed position without encountering opposing suction forces created by the temporary vacuum condition described above and. alleviates distortion of the container. The sealing ridges 52 and 54 also stabilize the': movement of displaceable member 44 during the unsealing step preventing the; displaceable -member from wobbling with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cartridge.<br>
).	The bottom end 50b of the cartridge housing 50 and the manipulable portion   '<br>
41 of displaceable member 44 may be adapted and configured to have a security/mechanism whereby any undesirable displacement of the displaceable member is prevented^- Such security measure will prevent unwanted'unsealing of the fluid-tight seal between; sealing wall 64 of the displaceable member and annular engagement member 60 of thq: partridge<br>
;  housing. In the particular embodiment of the cartridge unit illustrated here, cartridge : housing 50 has:a security ring 42 that interlocks with manipulable portion 41 of1..'<br>
.: displaceable member 44 preventing the displaceable. member from rotating which in turn prevents any axial displacement of the displaceable member. The interlocking between manipulable portion 41 and security ring 42 may be achieved by providing a set of<br>
► interlocking teeth structure 43a (see Fig, 5) on the inside surface of security ring:'42 and a mating set of interlocking teeth structure 43b (see Fig, 8) on the outer surface of:': manipulable portion 41.<br>
Cartridge housing 50 may be provided with a seal tamper prevention ribbon<br>
38 that connects security ring 42 to the rest of the housing 50. Removing seal tamper<br>
prevention ribbon 38 by pulling on the pull-tab 40 (see Fig. 2), detaches security ring:42        - *.:<br>
from the housing 50 so that manipulable portion 41 is accessible to the user for axially<br>
displacing the displaceable member into an unsealed position.	: \   .<br>

■ ibpeniiig ro preparation for receiving a cartridge member to assembler two-compartment . .: ^container. In order to assemble the multi-compartment container, this is the preferred' :!assembly orientation for the dispensing:iinit because the sealing membrane 22.must be. 'removed to insert the joining sleeve 34 of cartridge unit 30 into flange portion 14 during assembly. The bottom-side up orientation prevents the contents of the dispensing unit from . spilling, As discussed in reference to Fig-1, top-side opening 16 maybe sealed Avith a membrane 20. As illustrated, sealing iriembranes 20 and 22 may be provided Vith tabs 201 and 22' respectively.to enable the user to grab and pull the membranes.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the assembled two-compartment container according to the . present invention, in a bottom-side up orientation shortly after assembly, where;a cartridge unit 30 has been inserted into flange portion 14 of dispensing unit 10 forming :-a; two-compartment container. In this assembled state, the two assembly units, the dispensing unit and the cartridge unit form the upper and lower compartments of the assembledxontainer respectively. And as illustrated, seal tamper prevention ribbon 38 and security ring 42 are in place thus ensuring that displaceable member 44 of the cartridge unit remains; in the sealed position so that the contents of the two compartments are kept separate until ready to be mixed.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the assembled two-compartment container of Fig. 7. This as", assembled two-compartment containerhas two sealed Compartments SO and 82. As illustrated, top opening 16 of dispensing unit 10 is sealed with a membrane 20 and scalable filling opening 67 of cartridge unit 30 is sealed with a closure member 68&gt; And because displaceable member 44 of cartridge unit 30 is in the sealed position, the fluid-tight seal formed by sealing wall 64 and annular engagement member 60 separates inside chamber 80 of the cartridge unit from inside chamber 82 of dispensing unit 10, Thus, in the assembled state, the chambers 80 and 82 form-the upper and lower compartments of the two-compartment container assembly.<br>
Fig. 9 is a detailed cross-sectional view of the region A in Fig. 8. Fig, 9 illustrates that the fluid-tight seal between cartridge unit 30 and flange portion 14-of the dispensing unit is formed by one or more sealing ridges 36 provided on the outer surface of joining sleeve 34, and a pair of sealing ridges 37a and 37b that are provided on the outer surfacepf upper portion 50c of cartridge housing 50, The diameters of joining sleeve 34 and upper portion 50c of the cartridge unit and the corresponding mating surfaces of flange portion 14 are defined so that the two structures fit snugly when fully assembled;: This allows sealing ridges 36, 37a, and 37b to form friction-fit seals with the inside surfaces of flange portion 14 that is fluid-tight and prevent the contents of the assembled container from leaking.<br><br>
The detailed illustration, of Fig- 9 shows that flange portion 1.4/i$. two-tiered   ■ : having an upper portion 14a and a lower'portion 14b. Upper portion 14a provides the sealing surface for sealing ridge 36 while }ower portion 14b provides the sealing surface for \ sealing ridges 37a and 37b. Each portions 14a and 14b has a thick-walled section 14c, 14e . and a thin-walled section 14d, 14f respectively. The flange portion 14 is configured this way to prevent the sealing ridges 36 and 37a from sealing]/ engaging the flange portion 14 prematurely as cartridge unit 30 is inserted into flange portion 14 during assembly.  ■<br>
As the cartridge unit is inserted into flange portion 14, sealing ridges 36 and '37a first pass through thin-walled sections 14d and I4f respectively. During this stage of the assembly, because the diameter of the'openings provided by thin-walled sections 14d :and 14f are sufficiently large, sealing ridges 36 and37a do not make contact with sections 14d and 14f. This allows the air from inside chamber 82 of dispensing unit 10; to escape as the air is being compressed by cartridge unit 30 which is being inserted into flange portion 14. If air were not allowed to escape, the air pressure inside chamber 82 would prevent the cartridge unit from fully Inserted into flange portion 14. As cartridge unit 30 is inserted ■ further, sealing ridges 36 and 37a will sealably engage thick-walled sections 14c and 14e.<br>
Flange portion 14 and the mating surfaces of cartridge unit 30 further may be provided with structures that lock the dispensing una to the cartridge unit after, they axe ■ assembled. An example of such locking structures may be a set of a groove and "a mating projection that will lock the dispensing unit and the cartridge unit by a snap-fit connection.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the assembled two-compartment container of Fig. 7 in a top-side up orientation where the contents of the two compartments have been mixed into a formulation and a baby feeding nipple assembly 70 has been attached to the top opening of the container. Before attaching feeding nipple assembly 70, sealing membrane 20 would have been removed from top opening 16. Fig. 10 also shows that sealing tamper prevention ribbon 38 and security ring 42 have been removed in order to access the manipulable portion 41 of dispbceable member 44. The displaceable member 44 has been axially displaced downward to the unsealed position so that the contents of the two compartments can be mixed.<br>

Fig. 12 illustrates a perspective view of the basic assembly units TOT : assembling an embodiment of a multi-compartment container having more thajrtwo rcompartments. In this example, a dispensing unit 10 and two cartridge units 30 'and 30r are utilized. Dispensing unit 10 has been placed in bottom-side up orientation showing that the ' bottom opening is sealed with sealing membrane 22. The cartridge units are configured so : that the joining sleeve and the upper portion of one cartridge unit may fit into the bottom-' side opening (i.e., the sealable filling opening) of another cartridge unit's displaceable<br>
member. When two cartridge units are connected to one another serially in this manner, the , two units engage to form fluid-tight seals in the same manner as the fluid-tight seal formed • between a cartridge unit and a dispensing unit as described above in reference to;Fig« 9.   -<br>
Fig. 13 illustrates a perspective view of the assembly units of Fig*'12 where : sealing membrane 22 has been removed firom dispensing unit 10 exposing bottom opening 18 in preparation for assembling cartridge; unit 30 and dispensing unit 10.<br>
Fig. 14 illustrates an interim stage in, the assembly Of a three-compartment : container where cartridge unit 30 has been assembled with dispensing unit 10 by;inserting the top open end of cartridge unit 30 into flange portion 14 of dispensing unit 10. Before the next assembly step of inserting a secondary cartridge unit 30' into the bottom! of cartridge unit 30, closure member 68 must be removed from annular rim 66 of displaceable 1: member 44 to unseal sealable filling opening 67, This temporarily exposes inside chamber -. 80 of cartridge unit 30 until second cartridge unit 30' is inserted into the bottom end of displaceable member 44. This allows the inside chambers of the two cartridge units to;be in flow-communication with each other when displaceable member 44' of secondary cartridge unit 3D1 is in an unse.aled position. (See Fig. 17 and accompanying text below).'. '   .<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates 3 fully assembled three-compartment container, where two ■ cartridge units are sealingly engaged to dispensing unit 10 in a serial manner. Cartridge unit 30' has been inserted into the bottom of displaceable member 44 of cartridge unit; 30.   The seal tamper prevention ribbons 38, 38f and security rings 42., 42r have not been removed from the cartridge units and therefore the'three compartments formed by the twd cartridge units 30 and 30' and dispensing unit 10 are sealed from one another to keep their contents separate until ready to be mixed.<br>
Fig, 16 illustrates a perspective view of the three-compartment container : ^assembly of Fig. 15 where displaceable member 44 of cartridge unit 30 has been axially : . displaced into the unsealed position establishing a flow-communication between:the inside<br>

On the outer'surface of :manipulableportiori 41, locking teeth structure 43b may now be seen since security ring 42 has been removed. In this illustration, sealing membrane 20 has been removed from dispensing unit 10 exposing top opening 16 for attaching an appropriate dispensing device.<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates a longitudinal cutaway view of the three-compartment container assembly of Fig. 16 where the displaceable members of both cartridge units have been axially displaced to their respective unsealed positions establishing flow-' communication among all three compartments 82, SO, and 80' to allow the contents of the compartments to mix and form a formulation. As illustrated, displaceable member 44 of 'first cartridge unit 30 has been axially displaced into its unsealed position by turning the displaceable member via the manipulable portion 41. As discussed in reference to Fig. 4, displaceable member's side wall 46 threadably engages the inside surface of cartridge housing 50 and by turning the displaceable member, the user may manipulate it in an axial direction from a sealed position to an unsealed position. Thus, sealing wall 64 and its annular projection 62 have been disengaged from annular engagement member 60 thus allowing-a flow-communication between'upper chamber 82 and middle chamber 80 through opening 35.<br>
In this illustration, displaceable member 44? of second cartridge unit 30' also has been axially displaced into its unsealed position. This maybe achieved in; a-similar manner as "described.above in reference to. displacealple member 44 of first cartridge unit 30/<br>
. Sealing wall 64' and its annular projection; 62? have been disengaged from annular engagement member 60' thus allowing a flow-communication between middle chamber 80 : ind lower chamber 80* through openings.35 and 67. It should be noted that, as discussed in ' reference to Fig. 14, closure member 68 has been removed from annular rim 66 of<br>
, displaceable member 44 before secondary cartridge unit 30* was inserted into the bottom end of displaceable member 44 thereby unsealing opening 67. In contrast, closure member .<br>
: 68T of second cartridge unit 30T remains in place functioning as the bottom wall of the"<br>
'. assembled three-compartment container..<br>
It would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that<br>
' additional cartridge units may be attached to second cartridge unit 30' in order to introduce additional compartment holding another component of a formulation. Before another<br>
■cartridge unit can be attached to second cartridge unit 30\ closure member 68T must be<br>
.removed thereby unsealing sealable filling opening 67'.<br><br>
It would be also appreciated that the cartridge units and the dispensing units of the assembly system of the present invention may be adapted and configured; so that the assembly units can be screwed to one another. The appropriate openings of each assembly units can be provided with screw-threads so that they can be assembled together like a bottle and a screw cap.<br>
Returning to illustration of Fig. 17, with the three compartments; of the container assembly, 82, 80, and 80\ in flow-communication with one another, the contents of each compartment may be mixed to form a formulation. For illustrative purposes, a dispensing device in the form of a feeding nipple assembly 70 also has been threadably attached to top opening 16 of dispensing unit 10 by engaging threads 19.<br>
In another embodiment, the displaccable member and its associated sealing wall of a cartridge unit are configured in such a manner that the sealing wall may be moved ■ between a sealed position and an unsealed position without involving any axialmovement of the displaceable member or the sealing walh<br>
Fig* 18 is an illustration showing a partial cutaway view of a such container  ; assembly that has been assembled into a:two-compartment configuration. This'embodiment . has a dispensing unit 110 assembled together with a cartridge unit 130, Dispensing unit 110' has a housing 112 and a flange portion 114 and a top.opening 116 that may be fitted with a cap 105, or sealed with other appropriate,sealing methods. Top opening 116 also maybe fitted with an appropriate dispensing device to assist in dispensing of the contents of the container. Cartridge:unit 130 has a housing 150 with a top-end wall 155 provided with one or more flow-through openings 157. Cartridge unit 130 further may be provided with a joining sleeve 134 in the form of an annular projection projecting above top-end: wall 155r Joining sleeve may be provided with sealing ridges 137a and 137b that sealingly engage inside wall portion of flange portion 114 to form one or more fluid-tight seals between joining sleeve 134 and flange portion 114. Cartridge unit 130 also may be provided with a security ring 142.<br>
A displaceable member 144 is provided within cartridge housing 150 and has : a user manipulable portion 141 forrotationally moving the displaceable member-between a sealed position and an unsealed position. User manipulable portion 141 of the displaceable member is connected to a sealing wall 164 via a side wall 148, Side wall 148 is provided with a retaining guide 145 on its outer surface that cooperates with projection .154 along the inside surface of cartridge housing 150 toretain the displaceable member in place as the displaceable member is rotated about longitudinal axis L of the cartridge unit between the sealed position and the unsealed position. :<br><br>
Sealing wall 164 of cartridge unit 130 is situatedjust below topfend wall 155 '   of the cartridge unit and has one or more'flow-through openings 170 corcesporidrng to;the flow-through-opening 157 of the top-end wall 155. When sealing waU 164 is rb Its sealed position, flow-through openings 170 and 157 are mis-aligned and the combination of - :_ sealing wall 164 and top-end wall 155 foim a partitioning seal between dispensing unit 110 and cartridge unit 130. When sealing wall 164 is in its unsealed position, fiow-through openings 170. and 157 are aligned with each other and the openings establish a flow-communication between dispensing unit 110 and cartridge unit 130.<br>
Security ring 142 provided-at the bottom end of cartridge unit 130 may be :  provided with a set of locking teeth structure on its inside surface (not shown in. the<br>
■	drawing) that cooperate with a set of locking teeth 190 provided on the user manipulate portion 141 of displaceable member 144to prevent the displaceable member from.turning unnecessarily. This locking mechanism provides the security protection that prevents unsealing of the cartridge unit during storage and also prevents any premature unintended ■unsealing of the partitioning seal between dispensing unit 110 and cartridge unit 130. Security ring 142 is connected to cartridge housing 150 by a breakable joint 143which;may be broken by forcibly turning the security ring. Once breakable joint 143 is broken, the user '<br>
■	may rotate the displaceable member into, the unsealed position by turning the user ' manipulable portion; 141 and mix the contents of the container into a formulation ;for use.<br>
Fig. 19 is a partial cutaway view7 of the container assembly of Fig.=18 with another cartridge unit 130* attached to first cartridge unit 130 thus forming a three-compartment container assembly similar-to the assembly shown in Fig. 17. The container assembly is shown with displaceable member 144 of cartridge unit 130 in an unsealed position while displaceable member 144' of cartridge unit 130' is in a sealed position. The bottom opening of cartridge unit 130* maybe sealed with a closure member 168' in the manner described in reference to Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 20 is a detailed view." of the container assembly of Fig. 19 showing detailed structure of the cartridge units of this embodiment. As shown here and also discussed in reference to Fig. 18, the fluid-tight seal between flange portion 114:of dispensing unit 110 and cartridge unit 130 is formed by sealing ridges 137a and 137b that sealingly engage the inside surface of flange portion 114. It is also to be appreciated that flange portion 114 is provided with a thick-walled section 114a and a thin-walled section 114b so that the manner in which sealing ridges 137a and 137b engage to form the fluid-tight seal is same as described in reference to the seal between flange portion'1.4 and sealing ridges 37a and 37b in Fig. 9. It is to be noted that at the bottom end of displaceable<br><br>
member 144 is provided a sealing flange-141a that cooperates with sealing ridges 137a' and-<br>
■'   137br of second cartridge unit 130'.	U<br>
■ As mentioned in reference to Fig. 20, displaceable member 144! of cartridge • unit 130 is in an unsealed position so that flow-openings 157 and 170 are in alignment and allow flow-communication between inside chamber 180 of cartridge unit 130 and the<br>
;     dispensing unit 110. Displaceable member 144' of cartridge member 130' is in a sealed position so that flow-openings 157T and;170T are not in alignment. Thus, top-end wall 155T and sealing wall 164f form a partition seal between inside chamber 180 of cartridge, unit 130 and inside chamber 180r of cartridge unit 130Based on the above descriptions of the basic assembly units including a<br>
0  dispensing unit and-'a cartridge unit, it is to be appreciated that one may assemble not only two or,three-compartment containers but multi-compartment containers having several- or more compartments by employing as many cartridge units as necessary and connecting them in.series. It also is to be appreciated that amulti-cojripartment container may be assembled -<br>
■	by connecting two or more cartridge units in series without any dispensing unit*! Once the<br>
5  contents of the cartridges are mixed into a formulation, the formulation, whether it be a<br>
■	liquid or powder, may be dispensed through the end opening of one of the two terminally<br>
located cartridges. In other words, the mixed content may be dispensed througfrthe top<br>
opening of the top cartridge or the bottom opening of the bottom cartridge. If a; separate<br>
dispensing device were required by a particular application, an appropriate dispensing<br>
0  device maybe attached to the opening of the dispensing cartridge.<br>
Furthermore, another configuration of a multi-compartment container<br>
assembly includes one or more cartridge units attached to both open ends of a dispensing<br>
unit.	}Fig. 21 illustrates an example of such an assembly configuration.; Two<br>
5   cartridge units 230 and 230? are attached to each end of a dispensing unit 210. The<br>
cartridge units maybe the type illustrated by cartridge unit 30 in Figs. 8-11 or the type<br>
illustrated by cartridge unit 130 in Figs. 18-20. However, it will be appreciated;by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the specific structures of the cartridge units used in tile assembly<br>
system of the present invention are not limited to these two types of cartridgeunits.<br>
)	Cartridge unit 230 has structures similar to cartridge unit 30 illustrated in<br>
Figs. 8-11. But unlike cartridge unit 30,"cartridge unit 230 3nd dispensing unit 210 are adapted arid configured to threadably engage each other. Joining sleeve 234 at .top end 250a of cartridge unit 230 and the top end opening of dispensing unit 210 are provided with, screw threads 235 and 219, respectively so that cartridge unit 230 and dispensing unit 210 '   can be screwed together.<br><br>
Cartridge unit 230 is provided with on axially displaceable member244 having a sealing wall 264 at its top end, Adapted and configured to sealingly engage■ ' cartridge housing 250, a user manipulate portion 241 at its bottom end, and at; least one  • connecting member 248 connecting sealing wall 264 and user manipulable portion 241.<br>
When'displaceable member 244 is in its sealed position, sealing wall 264 sealinglyengages<br>

cartridge housing 250 near its top end 250a closing the cartridge unit's top opening. When displaceable member 244 is in its unsealed position, sealing wall 264 is disengaged; from cartridge housing 250 allowing a flow-communication between inside chamber 280.of cartridge .unit 230 and the exterior of ths:- container.<br>
At the bottom end 250b df.displaceable member 244 is flllable opening 267 )  that may be sealed with a sealing membrane 268 by sealing the membrane to annular rim : 266 by a suitable sealing method such as:;heat sealing.<br>
Cartridge unit 230' sealingly engages the bottom opening of dispensing unit 210 and has structures similar to cartridge unit 130 illustrated in Figs, 18-20. Cartridge unit 230' and dispensing unit 210 are also configured and adapted to threadably engage each'1 &gt;  other. Joining sleeve 234* and the bottom end opening of dispensing unit 210 aire provided with screw threads 235' and 219\ respectively so that cartridge unit 230' and dispensing unit 210 can be screwed together.<br>
Cartridge unit 230* has a housing 250' with a top-end wall 255Vjprovi'ded with one or more flow-through openings/257'. A displaceable member 244' is provided within cartridge housing 250' and has a user manipulable portion 241' for rotatitonally ' moving displaceable member 244' between a sealed-position and an unsealed position. User manipulable portion 241' of displaceable member 244' is connected to a sealing wall 264' by a side wall 248'. Sealing wall 264.' of cartridge unit 230' is situated just below top-end wall 255' of the cartridge housing and has one or more Dow-through openings. When' sealing wall 264' is in its sealed position,:flow-through openings 257' and the flow-through ' openings on sealing wall 264' do not align with each other so that the combination of sealing wall 264' and top-end wall 255' form a partitioning sea] between dispensingunit 210 and cartridge unit 230\ When sealing wall 264' is in its unsealed position,.flow-through openings 257' and the flow-through openings on the sealing wall 264' are aligned with each other and the openings establish a flow-communication between dispensing unit 210 and cartridge unit 230'. Bottom fillaBle opening 267' may be sealed with a sealing membrane 268'. As discussed above in reference to scaling membrane 268 of cartridge unit 230, sealing membrane 268' may be sealed to annular rim 266 by a suitable sealing method such as heat sealing.<br><br>
Accidental displacement jofdisplaceable members 244 and 2j44£bf cartridge" units. 23.0 and 230\ respectively, can be prevented by utilizing the security ring; structure similar to the one illustrated in conjunction with cartridge units 30, 30T, 130, and 130' or other suitable mechanical means.<br>
It would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that a plurality of the cartridge units described in this embodiment of the present invention can also be assembled in series at each end of dispensing unit 210 similar to the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 15-17.<br>
In another embodiment, the dispensing unit may be a bottle likexontainer having only one opening. Again, one or more cartridge units may be attached in series to such a dispensing unit to assemble a multicompartment container assembly according to ■.the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, according toithe present invention, two or more cartridge units .maybe assembled serially to assemble a multi-compartment container. Each of the cartridge units in the assembly constitutes a sealed compartment holding a component of a formulation to be mixed. Once the contents of the container assembly have been mixed and are ready to be dispensed, the displaceable member of the upper-most cartridge-unit in this assembly.is moved to its unsealed position so that the mixed formulation can be dispensed through the top opening of the upper-most cartridge unit. If necessary, an appropriate' dispensing device, such as a baby feeding nipple, can be attached to the top opening of the ' upper-most cartridge unit.<br>
Another advantage of the ■multi-compartment assembly of the present 'invention is that each of the assembly units, whether it be a dispensing unit or a cartridge unit, can be filled with a component material and stored separately. And, an appropriate number of assembly units containing the appropriate component materials can be assembled into a multi-compartment assembly so that the contents of the assembly units can be mixed into a formulation and then dispensed directly from the assembly.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as examples, and that many other embodiments are possible and encompassed within the spirit and the scope of the present invention. The assembly units, cartridge units: and the dispensing units, described herein.and illustrated in the figures are examples only.
