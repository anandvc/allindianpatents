				<td>MULTIMEDIA PRESENTATION EDITOR FOR A SMALL-DISPLAY<br>
COMMUNICATION TERMINAL OR COMPUTING<br>
DEVICE* ******** *****TITLE******************<br>
(LEAVE ABOVE LINE AS Is UNTIL FINAL DRAFT) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.   TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains to the field of creating/editing presentations on a device with a small display. More particularly, the present invention pertains to creating presentations having content displayed/ played (providing possibly text and images and sound all at the same time) based on instructions encoded using the SMIL language oa a comparable XML-based language, and is especially useful for creating MMS messages using a handheld communication device, such as a cell phone.<br>
2 .   DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART<br>
The invention is related to editing/ creating (as opposed to viewing) multimedia presentations on a portable device. Multimedia presentations are e.g. shown by the device itself or using an external display or communicated between mobile/ cell phones or other communication terminals as a part of MMS -(multimedia oyotem)(Multmedia Messaging Service) messages, as prescribed by 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Program) technical specifications. (MMS, like Short Message Service (SMS), provides automatic and immediate delivery of personal messages, but allows incorporating sound, images, and other rich content, transforming it into a personalized visual and audio message.) The presentation part in MMS messages can use different formats, but Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced "smile") 2.0 is the mandatory format specified by the current 3GPP Release 5 specification. The presentation part includes all media objects (content of<br><br>
the multimedia presentation) as one data object/ assembly, describing their layout, timing and other aspects of displaying/ playing the media objects on the receiving communication terminal. For example, if an MMS message contains two slides and each contains a text object and an image, the MMS message consists of MMS headers, two image objects, two text objects, and one SMIL object with information to the effect that the message consists of a sequence of two time containers and that the first time container contains parallel media objects (image and text). See Fig. 1 for an example of the structure of a presentation object in MMS.<br>
SMIL is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based language. It contains building blocks called modules. The modules which are important from the point of view of the present invention are the so-called structure module, the timing and synchronization module, and the media object module. Each module includes one or more so-called elements and so-called attributes.<br>
The most important elements of SMIL are the so-called "par" and wseq" elements. A par element groups object that should appear in parallel, temporally, in a presentation. For example, if text and an image are shown on one slide at the same time, they will be put within a single <par> ... </par> pair in a block of SMIL code. A seq element may contain objects that are supposed to be presented to the user sequentially, one after the other, i.e. the second one will not become visible until the first has been displayed/ played and is not longer being displayed/ played. So the two slides from the previous example would typically be put within a <seq> ... </seq> pair to indicate that they must be played in sequence. Also the main body element is treated as a seq element when timing is considered. These and some other<br><br><br><smil><br><par><br><!--this is slide l--><br><img src="../index.html"><text src="../index.html"></text></par><par><!--this is slide 2--><br><img src="../index.html"><text src="../index.html"></text></par></smil><br><br>
more than two levels, a slide may itself be an entire presentation/ set of slides, each of which may itself be a new, further presentation/ set of slides, and so on.)<br>
MMS terminals available currently on the market are capable of editing or viewing only limited SMIL structures (in terms of time container nesting). The first (top) level of nesting represents the presentation and the second level represents slides. Media items are placed on the second level. Although some handheld terminals (such as cell/ mobile phones) can play more complicated content than a two-level presentation, it is impractical today for typical cell phones or other handheld terminals to create more complicated presentations because editing a three-level timing and a two-dimensional space presentations on the typically small screen of a mobile phone or other handheld and making it usable by an average user is difficult. All handheld-hosted editors today are not intuitive or simple and are too time-consuming when used to create complex presentations.<br>
Prior art MMS editors for handheld terminals (such as mobile phones) do not typically allow the content of a slide in a presentation to change with time. In other words, the slides created must be static (except that the media items contained in a slide may change, e.g. video clips, animated .GIF images, etc.). Other, more sophisticated MMS editors e.g. for desktop computers as opposed to handheld devices use an approach in which the entire presentation or animation (if the software is for video editing) is divided into "frames" displayed side-by-side in columns and rows, Fig. 3 showing one row, and a user can navigate between frames (in other words, move to a different point in the presentation) using some sort of a slider widget. An approach using frames displayed side-by-side is useful for computers with big screens, so that the software can reasonably display frames side-by-side all on the<br><br>
same screen. But doing so is not practical on a handheld device because of the small size of the screen.<br>
	Yet another approach is used in- desktop presentations<br>
editors ouch as e.g.—Microsoft PowerPoint-—In such editors it io-possible-to chow tho true layout of several different images that are to appear on a single slide of a presentation and show them in sequence on the slide using an animations menu/ toolbar.—However,—doing so requires that in the editor (view)—the images be displayed one on top of the other—(i.e. overlapping,—so that the topmost at least partially obscures the others).<br>
		What is therefore needed is a way of providing<br>
instructions for creating a complex multimedia message such as an MMS message on a handheld device, i.e. e.g. a multimedia message that is more than two levels.<br>

slide for a presentation.<br><br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a hybrid solution for how to create complex multimedia presentations on a handheld device, taking what is appropriate from the various existing solutions so as to provide increased editing capability on a handheld, editing that is intuitive and relatively fast.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, in editing a presentation 20 using an editor according to the invention, the parts of a slide 21 that change (i.e. typically the images, in that the images in a set of images 23a-c are to be shown when played one at a time and one after the other, but on the same slide 21) are shown like "frames" are shown by editors for desktop computers, i.e. next to each other (more specifically, one on top of the other, as shown in Fig. 2). But the parts of the slide 21 that are static--usually the text 22 for a slide--are shown only once, i.e. are not repeated for each part (usually an image) that changes. Such a hybrid solution saves space on the screen.<br>
The proposed solution assumes that the layout rules--i.e. e.g. the SMIL for the presentation--are fixed and that the part of a slide that does not change (typically the text) is fixed for the duration of a slide. For example, it is reasonable to suppose that a user might take three pictures with a built-in camera and might want to show the pictures in sequence in a presentation. At the same time the user might want a block of text to appear with all of the picture, such as e.g., "These are the pictures I took in front of my house." This is a likely use case because typing long text on a small device like a mobile phone (especially if it does not have a full "qwerty" keyboard) is time-consuming and so a user would likely not want to input a lot of different text blocks, whereas taking pictures is easy to do and fast. Also, it is unlikely that a user would want to manipulate the layout of a<br><br>
slide for a presentation on a handheld device because on a small screen there is not enough space for any (significant) manipulation.<br>
Using these assumptions, as explained above, the solution provided by the invention is to display images one under another (not overlapping, but arranged in a column) in the presentation editor--i.e. in edit mode--with instructions for play mode (provided e.g. using SMIL) that the images be displayed in a temporal sequence, one after the other. At the same time the horizontal layout remains true, i.e. corresponds to the layout seen when the presentation is played. Thus, the vertical layout in the editor does not correspond to the actual layout seen when the presentation is played: the vertical dimension in the editor represents time.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4A, a display device 10a of a communications or computing terminal 10 for an exemplary slide 21 is shown when the slide 21 is displayed by an editor according to the invention. The slide 21 includes two pictures 23a-b and accompanying text block 22, and so in edit mode the screen is as shown in Fig. 4A, with the two pictures 23a-b arranged in a vertical column (of two rows) and appearing on the screen at the same time, and the text block 22 appearing as the one and only row of another vertical column. The corresponding screen in play mode for the slide would show the two pictures 23a-b one after the other in time (i.e. not at the same time), with the (same) text block 22 displayed for each. The instructions for so playing the slide (i.e. for displaying it in play mode) are included e.g. in an SMIL object (not shown) included with the image objects 23a-b and text object 22 in e.g. an MMS message. Note that if the text were longer, or if there were more images in the first column, the display device 10a would provide scroll controls typically on the right hand side so as to allow viewing all the text.<br><br>
	The SMIL, in simplified form, corresponding to the _editor<br>
screen of Fig. 4A--i.e. indicated by the editor screen of FigL 4A as how the presentation is to be played, can be (more or less) as follows:<br><br>
(The "more or less" is because, as in the earlier exemplary SMIL code fragment, the SMIL code fragment here is also simplified encoding; an actual encoding in SMIL would include several more elements and attributes, none of which are relevant to the invention and so are omitted here for clarity.) To specify a presentation including both the slide(s) corresponding to the editor view of Fig. 4A and also another slide (or slides, depending on how you count) in whicl the same text is repeated for three different images, the SMI1 code fragment would be something like:<br><br><br><br>
_  As can be seen from the above SMIL code fragments, the invention allows creating a slide that is described by more than two (and in fact here three) levels of time containers in SMIL (as opposed to three levels of SMIL).<br>
	Referring now to Fig. 4B, the two screens in play mode<br>
corresponding to the single editor screen (which, depending on the display device 10a, may not be visible all at once, and so may require scrolling) displayed in Fig. 4A are shown on a display device that may be the display device 10a of the communications or computing terminal 10 on which the exemplary slide 21_was created using an editor according to the invention (as is indicated in Fig. 4B), or that may be any other display device (not necessarily communicatively coupled to the communications or computing terminal 10). As indicated by the above code fragment for slide 1, in play mode, while slide 1 is being displayed, first imagel is shown and then, after about 10 seconds, image 2 is shown, i.e. on the same slide.<br>
	Note that in some embodiments, to generate the SMIL (or<br>
comparable) code, the user using the editor would click on or otherwise signal the editor that the user would like to prescribe properties for an image being displayed in edit mode, and the user would then be presented with a dialog box in which the user is able to indicate e.g. the duration the image is to be displayed. The SMIL code can then be generated automatically based on the properties ascribed to each image and the arrangement of objects on the editor screen. Also, if a duration is not provided for the images, the editor can be configured to generate the SMIL code assuming a default duration for a slide and dividing the default duration for the slide into time segments of the same duration for each image. Alternatively, in some embodiments, a user can be presented<br><br>
with text editor by which the user can provide the SMIL__code for_a_ slide, referring to images either based on names associated with each and included in the respective properties of the images, or based on the order in which the images appear on the screen in edit mode.<br>
An advantage of the solution provided by the invention--at least in comparison to the frame-based approach of the prior art--is that it saves screen space and, in addition, has a more familiar look-and-feel for users already used to slide-based editors provided for use on desktop computers. To save screen space though, an editor according to the invention does not show the actual vertical alignment of the text versus image (i.e. as it is seen in playing the presentation); the user of the editor must preview the presentation in player mode to see the actual vertical alignment.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5 (and also to Figs. 2 and 4), the invention is shown as a method by which a multimedia presentation editor hosted by the communication or computing terminal 10 having the display device (screen) 10a, interfaces with a user so as to allow the user to create or edit the presentation 20 including a slide 21 that in turn includes a plurality of objects such as the text object 22 and the image objects 23a-c for display (and also objects 24 for providing audible components of the presentation), the method including: a step 51 in which the displayable objects 22 23a-c in each set of (typically image) objects of the slide 21 that are to be displayed sequentially (one after the other in time) in play mode are instead assembled by the editor in multi-object columns 25b, i.e. one under another, and the objects that are to be displayed continuously are assembled into one-object-long columns 25a; and a step 52 in which each column 25a-b is displayed side-by-side with each other column 25a-b. Thus, if a column includes only a single object, that object is a fixed element of the slide, i.e. it appears for the entire time the<br><br>
slide is displayed in play mode. On the other hand, in case of a column including more than one object, each object is displayed for only some of the time the slide is displayed in play mode. In other words, the displayable objects 22 23a-c of the slide 21 form on the display device 10a in edit mode one or more side-by-side vertical columns 25a-b some of which may include only a single object 22 and some of which may include more than one object 23a-c, thus providing that some parts of the slide 20 may remain fixed (the part with the text object 22 in the illustration of Fig. 2) while the slide is displayed in play mode and some parts may change (the part with the image objects 23a-b in the illustration of Fig. 2).<br>
	Although the invention has been shown and described in<br>
the case of unchanging text 22 and changing images 23a-c of a slide 21, so that in edit mode there are two side-by-side columns, it is also within the scope of the invention that there be more than two columns, and even that none of the columns include a single object. For example, a first column might include two objects, a second column three, and a third column four. In such a case, the timing relationships between the objects in the three columns can be specified by e.g. SMIL, or can even be automatically figure by a play device, based on the smallest number evenly divisible by the numbers of objects in each of the columns, in this case 12. An automatic determination of the timing relationship in this case would provide that each object in a column be displayed for a time proportional to the ratio of the smallest number evenly divisible by the numbers of objects in each of the columns to (divided by) the number of objects in the subject column.<br>
The invention has been described in terms (primarily) of the steps of a method. The invention also comprehends an apparatus for performing the above described steps. Thus, for each step described above, there can be a corresponding module<br><br>
of an apparatus, although it is also possible for the functionality for performing more than one  of the above-described steps to be incorporated into a single module. Such modules may be implemented as hardware, or may be implemented as software or firmware for execution by a processor. In particular, in the case of firmware or software, the invention is provided as a computer program product including a computer readable storage structure embodying computer program code--i.e. the software or firmware--thereon for execution by a computer processor provided with the communication or computing terminal 10.<br>
	It is important to understand that the invention is<br>
especially of use in creating presentations in any situation in which a small screen/ display is used, such as in handheld communication or computing terminals including e.g. digital cameras, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and so on, i.e. in any device hosting a microprocessor enabling a user of the device to manipulate images on a display.  Thus, the invention is not restricted to creating presentations that are communicated, as e.g. an MMS message; the invention pertains only to the creating of a presentation. The presentation may be played by the same device or by another device, one not even necessarily having a small screen. Moreover the presentation need not be telecommunicated to the other device, i.e. communicated over a wireline or wireless<br>
telecommunication network(s); the presentation can be created using e.g. a cell phone and then shown e.g. via an external display such as a TV or other video display device. Further, the invention can be used to create different kinds of presentations, including presentations compatible with Microsoft Powerpoint.<br>
It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention.  Numerous modifications<br><br>
and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention, and the appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements.<br><br><br>
