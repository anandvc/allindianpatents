				<td>DATA STORAGE MEDIUM IN WHICH MULTIPLE BITSTREAMS ARE<br>
RECORDED, APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REPRODUCING THE MULTIPLE<br>
BITSTREAMS, AND APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REPRODUCING<br>
THE MULTIPLE BITSTREAMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of recording and reproducing multiple bitstreams, and more particularly, to a data storage medium in which multiple bitstreams are recorded for multimedia data services, an apparatus and method for recording the multiple bitstreams, and an apparatus and method for reproducing the multiple bitstreams.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In conventional multi-media data storage media, different kinds of data such as video data, audio data, and/or extra data including text data are recorded in a multiplexed single bitstream.    Recording apparatuses for recording multimedia data record various kinds of data that constitute multimedia data in a single bitstream by multiplexing.   Accordingly, apparatuses for reproducing multimedia data have only a function of reading and reproducing a single bitstream.<br>
Therefore, when there is a need to replace a part of a bitstream recorded by multiplexing, first the multiplexed bitstream is read.   Then, the part of the bitstream is replaced with new data, and the entire bitstream is recorded again.    For example, when a user intends to replace an English caption recorded in a multimedia movie with a Japanese one, the bitstream of the movie is read and recorded again after replacing English caption data included in the bitstream with Japanese caption data. Furthermore, when the user wishes to restore the Japanese caption to the English caption, the English caption data, which was reserved for backup previously, is restored in the same process as for the Japanese caption replacement.<br>
In addition, when there is a need to insert a caption into a recorded movie, the bitstream of the movie is read, multiplexed together with caption data to insert the caption, and recorded again.    These processes are relatively burdensome.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An example of data recorded in an optical disc according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.    Referring to FIG. 1, main data, sub data, and extra data are recorded in the optical disc in separate bitstreams. Here, the main data have corresponding sub data and extra data.    However, not all the main data have corresponding sub data and/or corresponding extra data.<br>
Main data refer to data that can be independently reproduced.    For example, a movie including both video data and audio data may be a kind of main data.   Sub data refers to additional data to main data, which contains components to be reproduced in synchronization with the main data.   For example, sub-picture data to be reproduced as caption data along with video data recorded in a digital versatile disc may be a kind of sub data.    Extra data refers to additional data associated with main data, including an Internet link with respect to a particular scene of a movie, a movie script, an actor's profile, and a bonus clip.    Extra data are, but not necessarily, reproduced in synchronization with main data.<br>
Sub data and/or extra data corresponding to main data can be recorded along with the main data at the same time or sequentially with a time gap.    When the sub data and/or extra data and main data are recorded at the same time, a recording unit of an optical pickup alternately records the main data and corresponding sub data and/or extra data.<br>
Although sub data and/or extra data are generally reproduced in synchronization with main data, the sub data and/or extra data may be recorded separately from corresponding main data.    For example, only a sound track recorded as sub data of a movie, or only a movie script recorded as extra data of the movie may be output.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the structure of navigation information showing the relation between the main data, sub data, and extra data of FIG. 1.    Navigation information refers to control information required for easy searching and controlling multimedia contents stored in storage media including digital versatile discs (DVDs),<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, main data are associated with at least one sub data and/or extra data.    The main data on the top of the structural diagram of FIG. 2<br>
have one sub data and one extra data as additional data, next main data have only sub data as additional data, and next main data have only extra data as additional data.<br>
In particular, navigation information includes identifiers for particular bitstreams and playback time information on additional data corresponding to main data.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a recording apparatus according to the present invention.   The recording apparatus according to the present invention may be an apparatus used by a manufacturer in the production of an optical disc such as DVDs, or an apparatus used by general users to record desired multimedia contents.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the recording apparatus includes a control unit 31, a recording unit 32, a digital interface 34, and an encoder 35.    Here, the digital interface 34 is for receiving external digital signals, for example, for receiving multimedia data including main data (and additional data), through a network.   The encoder 35 receives and encodes main data or additional data, and transmits the coded main data or additional data to the recording unit 32.   The recording apparatus may include only the digital interface 34 or the encoder 35 if necessary.<br>
The recording unit 32 records the main data input from the digital interface 34 or the encoder 35 and additional data including sub data and/or extra data in separate bitstreams in an optical disc 300.<br>
The control unit 31 generates navigation information defining the relation between the main data, the sub data and/or extra data and transmits the navigation information to the recording unit 32.   The recording unit 32 also records the navigation information in a predetermined area of the optical disc 300.    In a recording operation, the recording unit 32 radiates a laser beam onto the optical disc 300 through an optical pickup (not shown) based upon the control signal from the control unit 32.<br>
In particular, all data are recorded to form a contiguous data area (CDA) to ensure normal reading and reproduction by a reproducing apparatus.    In other words, data are recorded to ensure that a decoder can continuously supply data even when data reading is temporarily interrupted by movement of an optical head of an optical pickup in the reproducing apparatus.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a reproducing apparatus according to the present invention.   The reproducing apparatus may be an apparatus used by general users to reproduce desired multimedia contents. Referring to FIG. 4, the reproducing apparatus includes a control unit 41, a reading unit 42, a multiplexer 43, a digital interface 44, and a decoder 46.    Here, the digital interface 44 is for externally transferring a digital signal, for example, transferring multimedia data including main data (and additional data) through a network.   The decoder 46 decodes main data and/or additional data, which have been encoded and written, and read by the reading unit 42, and outputs the decoded main data or additional data to an output device, such as speakers or monitors (not shown).   The reproducing apparatus may include only the digital interface 44 or the decoder 46 if necessary.<br>
The reading unit 42 reads data recorded in an optical disc 400 by radiating a laser beam onto the optical disc 400 through an optical pickup based upon the control signal from the controller 42 and by converting the laser beam reflected from the optical disc 300 to an electrical signal.   The reading unit 42 simultaneously reads the main data and the additional data including the sub data and/or extra data and transmits the read data to the multiplexer 43.   The read bitstreams may be a combination of main data, sub data, and extra data, a combination of main data and sub data, and a combination of main data and extra data, a combination of sub data and extra data, etc.   When at least two bitstreams are simultaneously read, an optical pickup of the reading unit 42 alternately reads the multiple bitstreams.   The reading unit 42 has a buffering function so that it can continuously supply data to the decoder 46 even when data reading is temporarily interrupted in a reproducing operation by movement of an optical head of the optical pick.<br>
The multiplexer 43 multiplexes the main data, the sub data, and/or the extra data, which have been separately received, based upon the navigation information. The multiplexer 43 can replace one component of main data with separate sub data and/or extra data.    For example, if main data is a video title in which video data, audio data and/or extra data are multiplexed, the audio data and/or caption data can be replaced with corresponding sub data.    A multiplexed bitstream output from the multiplexer 43 is externally transferred through the digital interface 44 or is decoded by the decoder 46.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a recording and reproducing apparatus according to the present invention.   The recording and reproducing apparatus may be an apparatus used by general users to record or reproduce desired multimedia contents.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the recording and reproducing apparatus includes a controller 51, a recording/reading unit 52, a multiplexer 53, a digital interface 54, an encoder 55, and a decoder 56.    Here, the digital interface 54 is for externally receiving or transferring a digital signal, for example, receiving or transferring multimedia data including main data (and additional data) through a network.   The encoder 55 receives and encodes main data or additional data, and transmits the coded main data or additional data to the recording/reading unit 52.   The recording and reproducing apparatus may include only the digital interface 54 or only the encoder 55 and the decoder 56 if necessary.<br>
Here, the multiplexer 53, the encoder 55, and the decoder 56 have the same functions as those of the recording apparatuses and the reproducing apparatuses described above with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.   The recording/reading unit 52 has the functions of both the recording unit 32 of the recording apparatus described with reference to FIG. 3 and the reading unit 42 of the reproducing apparatus described with reference to FIG. 4.   Also, the control unit 51 has the functions of both the control unit 31 of the recording apparatus and the control unit 41 of the reproducing apparatus.   Therefore, explanations of the functions described above will not be repeated here.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the recording and reproducing methods according to the present invention used by the recording and reproducing apparatuses which have the structures described above, will now be described.<br>

Next, sub data are read from an area separated from the area where the main data are recorded (step 802).   The multiplexer 43 or 53 multiplexes the read main data and sub data (step 803).    Here, necessary navigation information is read by the reading unit 42 or the recording/reading unit 52, and transmitted to the control unit 41 or 51, and then to the multiplexers 42 or 53 after being analyzed by the control unit 41 or 51.   Alternatively, the navigation information read by the reading unit 42 or the recording/reading unit 52 can be transmitted directly to the multiplexer 43 or 53.<br>
The multiplexed main data and sub data are output through the digital interface 44 or 54 (step 804), or are transmitted to and decoded by the decoder 46 or 56 (step 805).    The decoded main data and sub data are transmitted to and reproduced through an output device such as a speaker, a monitor, or a printer.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating another embodiment of the reproducing method according to the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 9, the reading unit 42 of the reproducing apparatus or the recording/reading unit 52 of the recording and reproducing apparatus reads main data from the optical disc 400 or 500 (step 901). Next, sub data are read from an area separated from the area where the main data are recorded (step 902).    Extra data are read from an area separated from the<br>
areas where the main data and the sub data are recorded (step 903).   The multiplexer 43 or 53 multiplexes the read main data, sub data, and extra data (step 904).

Next, extra data are read from an area separated from the area where the sub data are recorded (step 1002).   The multiplexer 43 or 53 multiplexes the read sub data and extra data (step 1003).    Here, necessary navigation information is read by the reading unit 42 or the recording/reading unit 52, and transmitted to the control unit 41 or 51, and then to the multiplexers 42 or 53 after being analyzed by the control unit 41 or 51.   Alternatively, the navigation information read by the reading unit 42 or the recording/reading unit 52 can be transmitted directly to the multiplexer 43 or 53.<br>
The multiplexed sub data and extra data are output through the digital interface 44 or 54 (step 1004), or are transmitted to and decoded by the decoder 46 or 56 (step 1005).    The decoded sub data and extra data are transmitted to and reproduced through an output device such as a speaker, a monitor, or a printer.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a data storage medium in which different kinds of data constituting multimedia contents are recorded in discrete bitstreams for easy data editing or replacement, and a recording apparatus and method for the same.    The present invention also provides an apparatus and method for simultaneously reading and reproducing multiple bitstreams.<br>
It is expected that there will be more types of multimedia data services in the future to satisfy a variety of needs of users.    A variety of multimedia contents will be<br>
provided by multimedia service providers through networks.   The present invention enables users to receive a variety of multimedia contents from multimedia service providers and to create a new multimedia content by data replacement or editing if necessary.<br>
