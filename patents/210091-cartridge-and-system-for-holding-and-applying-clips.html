				<td>CARTRIDGE AND SYSTEM FOR HOLDING AND APPLYING CLIPS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a cartridge for holding clips, particularly for holding hemostatic clips for use in surgical procedures.<br>
A great number of disclosures have been made in connection with cartridges for holding hemostatic clips.  Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,076,120, 4,961,499, 5,201,416, 5,908,430 and others.  One long standing problem in the industry is a cartridge with structure sufficient to securely hold clips, against loss during shipping and the like, which nevertheless allows the clips to be reliably removed without the need for excessive force and the like.  Typically, such clips are removed for use by a surgeon during a surgical procedure.  It is quite frequent that this maneuver must be accomplished with one hand.<br>
Many of the prior art efforts involve use of extending protrusions and the like which interfere with removal of clips by extending into the path of removal of the clip.  This tends to hold clips in place but makes removal of the clip too difficult.  Despite the efforts as indicated in the above-mentioned and other patents, the need clearly remains for a cartridge for reliably yet readily removably holding clips.<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide a cartridge which securely holds clips in releasable fashion.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will appear hereinbelow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing<br>
objects and advantages have been readily attained.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a cartridge for holding<br>
clips is provided which cartridge comprises a base; a plurality<br>
1<br><br>
of   walls   extending  from  said  base  and  having  wall   faces,    opposed wall   faces   of 'adjacent  walls   defining   a  space   for   receiving   a clip;   wherein  at  least  one  wall  of  said wall   faces  has   a roughened   surface  positioned  to  contact  a  clip   in   said   space whereby   said  clip  is   frictionally  held   in  said   space.<br>
Still   further  in  accordance  with   the  present   invention,    a clip   applying   system  is  provided  which   comprises   a   clip cartridge   having  a  base,   a  plurality  of  walls   extending   from said  base  and  having wall  faces,   opposed wall   faces  of  adjacent walls  defining  a  space  for  receiving  a  clip,   wherein at   least one   wall   of   said  wall   faces   has  a   roughened  surface  positioned to   contact, a   clip  in  said  space  whereby  said  clip   is frictionally  held  in  said  space;   and  an  applier  having   jaws   for removing   clips   from  said  cartridge  and  applying   said  clips   to  an environment   of  use;   wherein  a   first   holding   force   is  defined between   said  jaws  and  said  clip  and  a   second  holding  force   is defined  between  said  clip  and  said  roughened   surface,   and wherein   said   first  holding   force  is   greater  than   said   second holding   force.<br>

Figure   7   illustrates  a  section  of   a   cartridge   according   to the   invention  to  provide  additional  details   of  wall   structure thereof.<br>
DETAILED   DESCRIPTION<br>
The   invention   relates  to  a  cartridge   for  holding  clips, particularly  hemostatic  clips   for  use   in   surgery   and  the   like. Referring  to   the  drawings,   Figures   1-3   illustrate   generally   a cartridge   10   in  accordance  with  the present   invention.<br>
Cartridge   10   preferably   includes   a  base  portion  12   and   a plurality  of  walls   14   extending  from base   12   and   defining spaces 16   for  holding   clips   18.<br>
As  will  be  explained below,   the  cartridge   of  the  present invention  advantageously provides   for  holding  clips   18   securely in  place   in  cartridge   10  during  shipping   and positioning   for   use without  the  use  of  protruding members   extending   into   the   path   of the   clip  which  tend  to make  clip  removal   difficult.      Rather,    it has   been   found  that  a   lateral   squeezing   force   applied  to   clip   18 by   a   roughened  surface  or  surfaces  frictionally  holds   clips   18 in  place  while   allowing  removal  when  intended.      The   cartridge   of the  present   invention  thereby  securely  holds   clips   while nevertheless   allowing  for  convenient   removal  of   the   clips   when needed  by  a   surgeon.<br>
Base   12   is   preferably  a   substantially  elongate   structure having  ends   20   and   sides  22.     Walls   14   are   preferably  positioned transverse  to   the   long  dimension  of  base   12   so   as   to  define spaces   16  in  a   substantially  parallel   and   side-by-side<br>
3<br><br>
arrangement as   illustrated in Figures 1-3.  As shown, sides 22 of base 12 are the long dimension of base 12, and a longitudinal axis 24 of base 12 corresponding to this long dimension is also shown in the drawings.  Preferably, walls 12 and spaces 16 defined therebetween are substantially perpendicular or transverse to longitudinal axis 24.<br>
Walls 14 preferably include a series of alternating substantially rigid walls 26 and substantially flexible walls 28.  Each space 16 is preferably defined between one rigid wall 26 and one flexible wall 28, and flexible walls 28 are preferably formed, manufactured or otherwise provided having a bias slightly toward an opposing rigid wall 2 6 such that flexible wall 28 applies a lateral holding force to a clip 18 positioned in space 16.  Thus, flexible wall 28 has a bias toward a spacing from the opposed wall 26 which is smaller than the width of the clip in space 18.  As best illustrated in Figure 2, walls 14 may advantageously be arranged such that two flexible walls 28 are positioned between each pair of rigid walls 26, with a space 30 defined between adjacent flexible walls 28 so as to allow a flexible wall to be flexed away from rigid wall 26 during loading of cartridge 10 with clips.  It should be appreciated, of course, that other arrangements of walls could readily be used well within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, a sectional view taken through cartridge 10 is provided so as to illustrate flexible wall 28 and clip contacting surface 32 thereof.  Wall 28 as shown is preferably a smooth wall extending upwardly from the base 12 toward an open or terminal end 40 of space 16.  If desired, an upper edge 29 of wall 28 can be tapered away from opposed wall 26 to widen space 16 at open end 40.  This facilitates insertion of clips during manufacture loading or assembly, and also facilitates insertion of an applier to remove a clip.<br>
4<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, surface 32 is provided with a roughened portion or surface 34 positioned to contact a clip 18 within a space 16 so as to securely hold clip 18 within space 16 as desired.  This roughened surface is advantageously selected in accordance with the present invention to provide a sufficient lateral or frictional hold on clip 18 while nevertheless allowing clip 18 to be removed without difficulty when needed.  As will foe discussed below, a particular range of roughness or texture for roughened surface 34 has been advantageously found in accordance with the present invention to provide an excellent holding force on clips 18 without interfering with removal of clip 18 when desired.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sectional view illustrating a rigid wall 26.  As shown, rigid wall 26 is preferably provided having a substantially flat surface 36 having a raised portion 38 positioned to contact a clip 18 in space 16 as desired in accordance with the invention.  Raised portion 38 is preferably a straight-walled portion which extends from base 12 upwardly and away from base 12 and toward open or terminal end 40 of cartridge 10.  Raised portion 38 may also be provided with a roughened surface 42 if desired.  Raised portion 38 may also have an upper edge 39 which tapers away from opposed flexible wall 28 so as to widen space 16 at open end 40.  Thus, walls 26, 28 have extending portions which extend from the clip contacting portion to open end 40.  It is preferred that the clip contacting portions corresponding to surfaces 34, 42, when a clip is positioned between them, be substantially straight and parallel, and that the extending portions extend to open end 40 in a direction which is either straight, or tapered away from each other as with edges 29, 39, whereby the clip can be removed from the space with only laterally applied friction and without interference from protruding structures on either wall.<br>
5<br><br>
As   shown   in   Figure   5,   rigid  wall  26   is  preferably  also provided  with   support  members   44   for  supporting  a   clip   18   within space   16   as   desired.      Support  members   44   are  preferably   spaced structures   extending   from  raised portion   38   for   spaced  point<br>
contact   with   an   inner   surface  of  clip  18.      In the  embodiment<br>
shown   in   Figure   5,    support  members   are  substantially  vertically<br>
arranged  ridges   which  terminate  at   an  upper  end  in   support surfaces   46-for   contacting   clip   18   as  desired.      Figure   6   shows   a similar  view   illustrating   support  members   44  which   in  this figure   are   sectioned  to  further  illustrate   the   structure   of same.      As   shown,   members   44   contact   two  points  on  the  inner surface  of   clip   18   so  as   to  advantageously  provide   stable, spaced-point   support   for  clip  18  within  space   16  as   desired.<br>
As   discussed   above,   roughened   surfaces   34,   42   are preferably  provided  having  a  particular  range  of  roughness  which has  been   found   to  be  advantageous   for  holding  clips   18   in  place without   interfering  with  removal  when  desired.      Roughness   of such  a   surface   can   advantageously  be  measured  using,   for example,   a   roughness   gauge  as  provided by  Charmilles Technologies,   and  it   is  preferred  in  accordance  with  the  present invention   that   roughened  surfaces   34,   42   have  a   roughness    (Ra)    of between  about   18µm  and  about   33   urn.     More  preferably,   the roughness   is   between  about   21   urn  and  about   33  µm.<br>
The   desired  roughness   can  be  provided  through   a  number   of different   techniques.      For  example,   cartridge  10   is   preferably injection  molded,   and  the  mold   from which  cartridge   10   is   to   be manufactured   can  be  treated  so  as  to provide  the  desired roughened  surface,   or resulting pieces can be  subsequently treated  to   roughen  the  surface.      It  is  preferred,   of  course, that  the   roughened   surfaces  be  provided through  the  mold   so   that an  additional   step   is   not   needed.<br>
In   order   to  provide  the  roughened  surface,   the<br>
corresponding  surface  of  the mold is preferably treated  so  as   to<br>
6<br><br>
roughen   that   portion  of  the  mold,   which will  thereby  roughen  the desired  portion  of  the   resulting molded part.      The   relevant  mold. surfaces   can be  treated  through  electroerosion   for   roughening, same,   or   can  be  ground  so   as  to provide  the  desired  roughness It   is   preferred  in  accordance  with  the  present   invention   that the  mold  be   roughened  using  electroerosion  since  this   type   of roughening  process   does   not   result   in   "directional   roughness". As   used  herein,   directional   roughness   refers   to   surface roughness   which  has  a   greater  resistance  to   sliding  motion   in one   direction  than  in  another.     This   type  of  directional roughness   frequently  results   from  grinding  processes.      Grinding processes   can  nevertheless  be  used  to   roughen  the  desired mold surfaces   in   accordance  with  the present  invention,   provided  that the   grinding   is  carried  out   so  as  to  provide  directional roughness   which  has   reduced  resistance  to  sliding   in  a   direction that   does   not   correspond  with  the  direction   of   removing   of   a clip   from   the   housing.<br>
Figure   6   shows  jaws   of  an  applier  device  positioned  within housing   for   removal of   clip   18.     The   structure   of   cartridge   10 defines   a   direction  for   removing  this   clip   in  a  generally  upward direction   as   illustrated  by  arrow  A.      Thus,   should  the  mold   for making  cartridge  10  of  the  present  invention be  ground  or otherwise   provided  with  roughness  on   surfaces   34,    42  which   is directional,    it   is  preferred  that  the  mold be   ground  so   as   to provide   a   direction  of  roughness  or  direction  of  reduced resistance  to  motion  which  is  oriented  at   an  angle  with   respect to   arrow  A  of   at   least   about   45°.     Thus,   in  accordance   with   the present   invention,   roughened  surfaces   34,   42   are  preferably provided   either  with  non-directional   roughness,   or  with directional   roughness  wherein  the  direction  of   reduced resistance   to  motion  is   offset  with   respect  to  a   removing direction   defined by   cartridge  10  by  at   least   about   45°<br>
7<br><br>
As best illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, cartridge 10 may preferably also be provided with jaw guiding members 48, most preferably laterally spaced to either side of flexible walls 28 substantially as shown.  Jaw guiding members 48 are preferably substantially rigid members which are spaced from rigid walls 26 so as to define side-spaces 52, to either side of a clip 18 within space 16, to properly guide jaws 50 of an applier into position for use in removing clip 18 as desired and as illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
As best shown in Figure 4, jaw guiding members 48 may be rounded on their outer edges 54, and may have inner edges 56 which are substantially parallel to side edges 58 of flexible walls 28.  As best shown in Figures 1 and 7, jaw guiding members 48 define jaw guiding space 52 with a width 60 (Fig. 7) that is greater than the width of clip 18 positioned within space 16. Also as shown in Figure 1, jaw guiding members 48 may preferably be positioned between pairs of rigid walls 26 and have opposing jaw guiding surfaces 62 each facing a different rigid wall 26.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, flexible walls 28 are positioned in adjacent pairs each having a clip-facing surface 64, and it is preferred that the spacing 65 {Fig. 7) between clip-facing surfaces 64 be greater than the spacing 63 between jaw guiding surfaces 62.<br>
A system for applying clips is also provided in accordance with the present invention, and includes cartridge 10 as described and illustrated above, along with an applier having jaws 50 for example as illustrated in Figure 6.  It has been found to be particularly advantageous to provide jaws 50 having clip-contacting portions which, when gripping a clip 18, have a greater relative holding force than does the cartridge holding the clip.  The holding force is of course a function of three parameters, namely, coefficient of friction between surfaces, surface area and transverse force.  Thus, a greater coefficient<br>
8<br><br>
of friction between jaws 50 and clip 18 than between clips 18 and roughened surfaces 34, 42 is desired such that clips 18 will be firmly held within cartridge 10 as desired, but can nevertheless be readily removed using jaws 50 as desired.<br>
In addition, the type of roughness of the jaws of the applier has also been found to be important.<br>
As with the mold for cartridges 10, it is preferred that clip grasping portion of jaws 50 be roughened using either electroerosion to obtain non-directional roughness, or that the grasping portions be ground to provide roughness which is directional in an acceptable direction.  Since jaws 50 are typically provided with a channel for holding clips, and roughness is most useful in the channel, it is difficult to grind in roughness which is not directional along the length of the channel.  Thus, it is best to provide the desired roughness on the jaws using electroerosion.<br>
In further accordance with the invention,- base 12 preferably has a flat bottom surface 66 which may advantageously be provided with a sheet or coating of exposable adhesive or the like such that cartridge 10 can be fixed in place on a desired position of use, for example, a surgeon's cart and the like. The particular types of adhesive and covering for such adhesive are materials well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  This is particularly advantageous since during use of cartridge 10, a surgeon must frequently be able to remove a clip 18 using a single hand.  Bottom 66 is advantageously positioned on base 12 so as to support cartridge 10 on a flat working surface with walls 14 extending upwardly and away from the flat working surface.<br>
Alternatively, cartridge 10 can be mounted for use in a heavy base, which is a weighted structure having an upwardly opening dove tail groove in which cartridge 10 can be securely disposed.  Still further, other structures could readily be used<br>
9<br><br>
for stably holding cartridge 10 in place for use by a surgeon to remove clips, well within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Cartridge 10 may preferably be provided as a single molded part, and may be manufactured of polycarbonate, polyamide, or other similar materials which have been found to be excellent materials for cartridge 10 in connection with mechanical elastic performance and stability over time after sterilization processes such as Gamma ray, Ethylene oxide, temperature and so on.  The rigid and flexible walls are provided with the desired rigid and flexible nature through the structural formation of same.  That is, the rigid walls are preferably a double-walled and enclosed structure which lends stability and rigidity as desired and which defines opposed surfaces each of which defines one rigid wall of a space.<br>
The flexible walls are preferably provided as single-walled structures connected to the base at a portion which serves as a hinge to allow the wall to pivot away from the adjacent rigid wall as desired.  This allows insertion of clips during assembly or loading of the cartridge.  Further, defining a hinge at the base of the flexible wall serves to define a stable and constant force on clips 18 by maximizing the length of the wall between the hinge and force application point.<br>
This application is related to commonly owned PCT Application No. PCT/FR97/01410, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
It should readily be appreciated that the cartridge in accordance with the present invention advantageously provides for holding of clips through laterally applied pressure, ideally between one or more roughened surfaces, in a manner which does not position any interfering structure within the outlet space of the cartridge such that a clip can be readily removed by merely overcoming the frictional force of the relative roughness between the clip and roughened surfaces.<br>
10<br><br>
It should also readily be appreciated that although each of rigid and flexible walls 26, 28 have been described as having roughened surfaces, it is well within the scope of the present invention for only one or the other of these walls to be provided with a roughened surface.<br>
It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the illustrations described and shown herein, which are deemed to be merely illustrative of the best modes of carrying out the invention, and which are susceptible of modification of form, size, arrangement of parts and details of operation.  The invention rather is intended to encompass all such modifications which are within its spirit and scope as defined by the claims.<br>
