6	Background of the Invention<br>
7<br>
8     Field of the Invention<br>
9<br>
10	This invention relates to a breathing mask with built in sensors for monitoring<br>
11	patients with sleep apnea, breathing disorders for use during anesthesia or ventilation<br>
12	support.<br>
13<br>
14     Description of the Related Art 15<br>
16	Masks such as shown in patent 5,243,971 for applying a positive pressure to<br>
17	patients with apnea and other breathing disorders have been developed. These masks<br>
18	provide seals for preventing air from escaping from the mask at the junction of the<br>
19	mask and face. Other types of masks for gas delivery to a patient are also in common<br>
20	use.<br>
21	Measuring air flows to a patient has been accomplished by metering sensors in<br>
22	the air supply connected to the mask as in patent 5,503,146 or bv belts around the<br>
23	patients chest to measure his breathing as in patent 5,131,399.<br>
24	Some devices such as in patent 5,507,716 provide sensors combined with<br>
/ 25      sleep masks for covering the eyes of a patient. However there is no known example of<br><br>
1	sensors built into breathing masks for monitoring or studying patients with breathing<br>
2	disorders.<br>
3	Currently if a patient is to be carefully monitored a plurality of electrodes or<br>
4	sensors would have to be individually applied to the patient and wired to recording<br>
5	equipment. The plurality of sensors and tangle of ensuing wires impede the usage of<br>
6	such monitoring equipment. Sensors providing useful information include Electro-<br>
7	encephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electro-oculogram (EOG), electro-<br>
8	cardiogram (ECG), Pulse Transit Time (PTT), gas flow sensors, temperature sensors,<br>
9	microphones, blood oxygen meters, blood pressure sensors, pulse sensors, patient<br><br>
10	movement, position, light, activity sensors, mask leakage, mask pressure, eye<br>
11	movement by polyvinylidene flouride-(PVD) or Piezo, and other means of gathering<br>
12	data about the patient or his environment.<br>
13	It is very inconvenient for the patient and the health care worker to attach a<br>
14	series of different devices to a patient to monitor a plurality of different parameters<br>
15	simultaneously. Therefore a single device for easily measuring a plurality of<br>
16	parameters is desired.<br>
17<br>
1 g	Summary of the Invention<br>
19<br>
20	The invention relates to providing sensors in breathing masks to make it easy<br>
21	to monitor a patient. The mask has a soft pliable seal material around its perimeter in<br>
22	contact with the patient's face to form a secure seal therewith. Sensors may be<br>
23	recessed into the soft pliable seal material at the surface for contact with the skin of<br>
24	the user when the mask is applied to the user's face. The wiring for the sensors may<br>
25	be inside the soft pliable seal material insulating the wires from damage during use of<br><br>
1	the mask. Many sensors can be incorporated into the mask. Sensors may be placed on<br>
2	the perimeter or on other portions of the mask not in contact with the skin. Sensors<br>
3	may also be placed on straps or caps used in conjunction with the masks or on other<br>
4	devices used with the mask.<br>
5	Monitoring of patients with sleep disorders, breathing disorders or for<br>
6	anesthesia is made easier and more convenient for the patient and for the health care<br>
7	provider since all the sensors needed are built into a mask which is easily and quickly<br>
8	placed on the patient with all the wiring to the sensors integral with the mask and<br>
9	accessed by a single plug.<br>
10	The types of sensors on or in the mask and straps or caps connected to the<br>
11	mask include but are not limited to oximetery sensors, patient position sensors, eye<br>
12	movement sensors, leak detection sensors, EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, PTT,<br>
13	microphones, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, movement<br>
14	sensors, position sensors, light sensors, leak detection sensors and gas delivery<br>
15	sensors.<br>
16	Connections to outside sources of gases delivered to the mask are by a gas<br>
17	nozzle hook up on the mask. A connection to electrical power and data output cables<br>
18	are by a plug in to a cable connecting to the mask. Alternatively batteries in the mask<br>
19	and telemetry equipment in the mask can provide power and transmission of the data<br>
20	to a microprocessor or computer. For portability the microprocessor can be attached<br>
21	to the mask or be carried by the patient. Similarly a bottle of gas may be connected to<br>
22	the mask and carried by the patient to allow mobility of the patient while wearing the<br>
23	mask.<br>
24	Unique applications for the bio-mask include the capability to apply<br>
25	anesthesia-depth monitoring while administering anesthesia gas to a subject. The<br><br>
1	ability to monitor the patient non-invasively with the bio-mask while at the same time<br>
2	administering the anesthesia gas to the patient provides a bio-feedback function for<br>
3	immediate and responsive anesthesia depth of the subject. The bio-mask can be used<br>
4	to determine the subject's sleep state by applying standard sleep staging criteria, such<br>
5	as that of R&amp;K rules and/or the application of diagnostic techniques which analyze a<br>
6	number of EEG signals, such as Bispectral Analysis. The invention is unique in its<br>
7	capability to apply such analysis with the minimal-invasive application of a subject<br>
8	breathing mask.<br>
9	R&amp;K rules refer to "A Manual of Standardized Terminology, Technicques and<br>
10	Scoring System for Sleep Stages of Human Subject" by Rechtschaffen and Anothony<br>
11	Kales, Editors 1968 which is hereby made a part hereof and incorporated herein by<br>
12	reference.<br>

22	Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
23<br>
24	Fig. 1 shows the inside of mask 10 including the perimeter surface 12 which<br>
25	contacts the patient's face. The perimeter surface 12 has a plurality of zones 20. Each<br><br>
1	zone 20 having a sensor 25 in a recess 29 for measuring a parameter of the patient to<br>
2	be monitored or other data such as gas leakage. Other sensors 26 are on the mask 10<br>
3	but not in contact with the patient's skin. These sensors 26 measure patient data or<br>
4	related data such as ambient light, gas pressure in the mask or ambient temperature.<br>
5	The mask 10 has a gas connector 14 for connecting a hose 32 to provide a gas to the<br>
6	mask 10 and a mask interface connector 16 for plugging in a cable 30 for a power<br>
7	supply and for data transmission.<br>
8	In some embodiments of the invention the sensors 25 do not require an outside<br>
9	source of power as the sensors such as heat sensors and light sensors generate current.<br>
10	The mask perimeter surface 12 is preferably made out of a soft pliable<br>
11	material such as silicone rubber for making a good sealing contact with the face of the<br>
12	patient to prevent gas leakage. The material should be soft and pliable enough to<br>
13	follow the contours of the face. The perimeter surface preferably has recesses 29 on<br>
14	the surface for the insertion of sensors 25 so that the sensors can make contact with<br>
15	the patient's skin when the mask is pressed against the patient's face.<br>
16	As seen in Fig. 3 a sensor or electrode 25 attachment to the mask 10 preferably<br>
17	utilizes a rubber compound 28 such as silicon or other food grade type rubber<br>
18	embedded with carbon or other conductive materials for electrical contact of skin to<br>
19	the mask. As shown in Fig. 2 the recesses 29 are large enough to have room to make<br>
20	electrical connections to leads 27, which are buried in the soft pliable material under<br>
21	the perimeter surface 12. The leads 27 are thus protected from damage and electrically<br>
22	insulated. Preferably the sensors 25 will plug into the leads 27 or printed circuits in<br>
23	the recesses 29. The leads 27 are preferably on printed circuits embedded in the mask<br>
24	or fine wires embedded in the mask and connect the sensors 25 to the mask interface<br>
25	connector 16.<br><br>
1	Fig. 5 shows conductive material 40 on the surface in zones 20, such as carbon<br>
2	embedded silicon, can be used on the surface of the perimeter 12 of mask 10 in<br>
3	separate zones 20 to conduct the electrical surface energy from the patient's face. The<br>
4	conductive material 40 is preferably moisture activated to improve the its electrical<br>
5	conductivity when in contact with the skin. The conductive material 40 may be<br>
6	applied for all electrode 25 contacts in all zones 20. Alternatively electrodes 25 may<br>
7	directly contact the patients face. The electrodes may also be inside of the soft pliable<br>
8	material on the perimeter 12 of the mask 10.<br>
9	Fig. 4 shows a side view of the mask 10 and straps 35 used to keep the mask<br>
10	in place on a patient. The straps 35 have sensors 25 connected to leads 27, which<br>
11	connect the sensors to the mask interface connector 16 and to cable 30 for<br>
12	transmitting data to a computer or other device. The sensors 25 in the straps 35 may<br>
13	be electro-encephalogram EEG sensors for measuring brain waves. The straps 35 may<br>
14	be replaced with a cap having sensors therein. Alternatively a chin strap 37 may be<br>
15	used having sensors 25.<br>
16	Fig. 5 shows an example of the types of sensors 25 used in zones 20 around<br>
17	the perimeter of the mask 10. Physiological signals from a patient's skin potential are<br>
18	detected by sensors in the zones 20 around perimeter 12 of mask 10. Conductive<br>
19	electrode paste 40 may be used to improve the electrical contact between the sensors<br>
20	25 and the surface of the skin. The conductive paste 40 can assist in reducing the<br>
21	impedance between the face and the electrical output from the sensors 25 in zones 20.<br>
22	The conductive paste 40 may also assist in preventing gas leaks.<br>
23	As an example of a mask sensor layout the following sensors and their<br>
24	functions are described. However many other types of sensors and arrangements of<br>
25	the sensors are possible.<br><br>
1	Zone 50 is an electro-oculogram (EOG) to obtain electrical eye movement<br>
2	reference signals from over the bridge of the nose.<br>
3	Zone 51 is an EOG to detect electrical eye movement signals for the inner left<br>
4	eye and zone 61 is designated for electrical eye movement signals for the inner right<br>
5	eye. Eye movement data is related to stages of sleep such as rapid eye movement<br>
6	REM, which indicates a deep sleep state and dreaming.<br>
7	Zone 52 is designated for an EOG to detect electrical eye movement signals<br>
8	for the outer left eye and zone 62 is designated for electrical eye movement signals for<br>
9	the outer right eye.<br>
10	Zone 53 is designated for electro-myography (EMG) to detect electrical<br>
l ]	signals from muscle contractions in the upper left chin. Zone 63 is correspondingly<br>
12	for the upper right chin. Zones 54 and 64 are for the lower left and lower right chin<br>
13	respectively. The amplitude of the chin signals is proportional to the relaxation state<br>
14	and subsequent sleep state of the patient.<br>
15	Zone 55 is the EMG for the upper left lip, giving information about sleep<br>
16	stages. It is proportional to the relaxation and sleep states of the patient. Zone 65 is the<br>
17	EMG for the upper right lip.<br>
l g	Zone 56 is the EMG for the left nasal inner mask it also provides signals for<br>
19	the lip movements and is proportional to the relaxation and sleep states of the patient.<br>
20	Similarly zone 66 is for the right nasal inner mask EMG.<br>
21	Zones 57 and 67 are for the oral left and oral right outer mask EMG signals<br>
22	which are also proportional to the relaxation and sleep states of the patient.<br>
23	Zone 70 is for pressure sensor ports for airflow determination.<br>
24	Microphone 80 on the mask detects the patients breathing or snoring sounds.<br><br>
1	Fig. 6 shows an alternate embodiment where two sensors 58 and 68 are used<br>
2	to find the patient's electrocardiogram ECG. This data is also useful for monitoring a<br>
3	patient. The patient's heart functions provide a lot of useful data about the patient's<br>
4	condition. Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is the time it takes ECG pulses to travel from the<br>
5	heart to a sensor such as a sensor placed on the head, on a finger tip, or on the ear.<br>
6	PTT sensors can be in the mask, on sensors connected to the mask, or sensors used in<br>
7	conjunction with the mask. PTT measurements are used to determine patient arousals<br>
8	and qualitative blood pressure variation.<br>
9	Thermal sensor 81 is used on the inside surface of the mask to detect nasal<br>
10	breathing. Thermal sensor 82 is used on the outside surface of the mask to detect oral<br>
11	breathing. The thermal sensitivity of the sensors 81 and 82 on the surface of the mask<br>
12	10 opposite the nose or mouth indicates if the patient is breathing through his nose or<br>
13	mouth. The thermal sensors 81, 82 may alternatively be placed on the inside of the<br>
14	mask 10, on the outside of the masklO, or inside of the material of mask 10 for<br>
15	detecting breathing. The thermal sensors 81, 82 may be a thermistor material, a<br>
16	thermocouple material or any other temperature sensitive material. The thermal<br>
l?	sensors 81, 82 may be coatings on the inside of the mask, the outside of the mask or in<br>
18	the mask. The thermal sensors 81, 82 detect heat, which is proportional to the amount<br>
19	of breathing.<br>
20	It is important to detect oral breathing for undetected or partially undetected<br>
21	oral breathing effects the integrity of the patient breathing gas breath monitoring and<br>
22	subsequently compromises the idea gas delivery to the patient. It is important to detect<br>
23	mouth breathing to assist in diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing. Further, control<br>
24	of a mask nasal ventilation is effected by mouth breathing.<br><br>
!	A pressure sensor 84 measures the pressure inside of the mask to indicate if<br>
2	there is positive pressure inside of the mask and how much. A pressure drop may<br>
3	indicate a leak.<br>
4	A surface reflective oximetry sensor 85 on the inside of the mask detects the<br>
5	patients pulse rate and oxygen saturation.<br>
6	A surface blood pressure sensor 90 on the perimeter 12 of the masklO in<br>
7	contact with the patient can be used to monitor the patients blood pressure.<br>
8	A thermistor 91 on the perimeter 12 of the mask 10 in contact with the patient<br>
9	can be used to monitor the patients temperature.<br>
10	A patient recycled air detection system having a sensor 95 on the inside<br>
11	surface of the mask detects the amount expired air from the patient remaining in the<br>
12	mask 10. High levels of expired gas in the mask indicates the mask is not being<br>
13	flushed out and may lead to problems if not enough fresh gas is introduced.<br>
14	A patient back gas occurrence detector 97 in the mask hose connector 14<br>
15	detects the amount of expired gas in the mask returning with newly delivered gas.<br>
16	Fig. 7 shows thermal sensors 83 such as thermistors or thermocouples on the<br>
17	inside or outside of the mask adjacent the perimeter 12. These sensors can be attached<br>
18	to a thermally conductive material 92 around the perimeter of the mask 10.<br>
19	Alternatively the thermally conductive material may be on portions of the perimeter.<br>
20	This thermally sensitive material can be on the inside surface of mask 10, the outside<br>
21	surface of mask 10 or embedded within the mask material. Detection of a temperature<br>
22	change by thermal sensors 83 or thermal sensors 83 on thermally conductive material<br>
23	92 correlates with mask leakage around the perimeter. The thermally sensitive<br>
24	material may be a thermally sensitive material in the mask on the inside of the mask,<br>
25	on the outside of the mask or on the perimeter of the mask. The thermally sensitive<br><br>
1	material may be a thermistor, a thermocouple, or any other thermally sensitive<br>
2	material.<br>
3	Gases leaking from the mask 10 will cause a temperature change associated<br>
4	with the thermally conductive material 92 and sensors 83 and allow a healthcare<br>
5	specialist real-time monitoring of leak status or post monitoring status of mask<br>
6	leakage. In some instances this can be life saving where a patient's gas delivery is<br>
7	critical and in other cases the leakage incidence can assist in the diagnosis of a patient.<br>
8	This assistance may be in the form of alerting a health care specialist that the gas<br>
9	delivery was subject to leakage and this may affect patient treatment and patient<br>
10	diagnostic conditions. In other instances the gas leakage detection can allow the gas<br>
] i	delivery system to automatically compensate for the gas leakage.<br>
12	A light sensitive resistor 86 on the outside surface of the mask 10 indicates the<br>
13	ambient lighting conditions of the patient.<br>
14	Position sensors 87 indicate position or activity of the patient. For example<br>
15	these sensors show if the patient is lying down and is motionless. Such a sensor may<br>
16	be a moving ball across switch contacts, or mercury sensor switches.<br>
17	Body movement sensor 88 can be a PVD or piezo material or micro<br>
18	mechanical to detect the patients body movements extent and rate to determine a<br>
19	wake versus rest state.<br><br>
20	All of the above sensors may send data by telemetry rather than by cable 30.<br>
21	All of the above collected data may be used to monitor a patient for a variety<br>
22	of uses including sleep studies, anesthesia and sleep apnea.<br>
23	The data collected can be converted to a serial data stream to allow a single<br>
24	wire to interface all the sensors. The sensors may provide data to adjust gas delivery<br>
25	to the patient.<br><br>
1	Gain and filtering adjustments to the signals may be used to condition the<br>
2	signals close to source for optimal noise and signal performance.<br>
3	An electrical bias to sensors such as a patient position sensors, thermal<br>
4	conductive zones, microphones, or light dependent resistor may be applied.<br>
5	A computer may process the data or simply store the data to from the<br>
6	monitoring sensors in the mask or straps attached thereto. The monitoring data may be<br>
7	used to diagnose a patient, provide feedback to machines attached to the patient,<br>
8	increase or decrease air supplies to a patient or perform other functions.<br>
9	An example of EEG data controlling in a bio-feedback application the delivery<br>
10	of gas to a patient may be when a patient has a nasal ventilation device such as a<br>
11	ventilator Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP), Bi-Positive Air Pressure<br>
12	(BIPAP), Variable Positive Air Pressure (VPAP), Sleep Linked Positive Air Pressure<br>
13	(SPAP) and the EEG electrodes provide one of the vital signs of if the patient is<br>
14	asleep. Gas is only applied to the mask when the patient is deemed to be asleep. This<br>
15	function is more sophisticated, sensitive to patient comfort and commercially viable<br>
16	than delay ramp systems used on some ventilation systems.<br>
17	hi ventilation devices that use delay ramps the user sets a time of the system<br>
18	allocates a time and ramps up the gas pressure delivery to the patient so that the<br>
19	application of gas does not have as much disturbing affect on the user and adversely<br>
20	effect his ability to sleep.<br>
21	The sensors in the mask 10 are better able to determine when the patient is<br>
22	actually asleep before applying assisted nasal ventilation. Premature application of<br>
23	pressure can prevent the patient from sleeping due to the added discomfort of positive<br>
24	pressure.<br><br>
1	The mask 10 may be made such that it is a sterile disposable unit for medical<br>
2	use thus lowering costs of treatment by not needing to sterilize masks for new patients<br>
3	and providing a more sterile treatment than reusable masks.<br>
4	Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are<br>
5	possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within<br>
6	the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as<br>
7	specifically described.<br>
