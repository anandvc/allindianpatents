COMPLETE SPECIFICATION	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br><br>
The invention relates to the production of xylitol. More particularly the invention relates to the production of xylitol by microbial conversion of xylose in water. <br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol with significant medical and commercial applications and has been widely used as an alternative low calorie sweetener. Xylitol occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables and also as a natural intermediate product in glucose metabolism of humans and other animals as well as in the metabolism of several plants and microorganisms.<br>
Xylitol has numerous advantages including the same sweetness as sucrose but with one-third fewer calories and no unpleasant aftertaste. In addition its negative heat of dissolution imparts a cool and refreshing sensation in the oral cavity, making it a popular sweetener for candies and sweets. Xylitol also finds favor with diabetic patients as it is metabolized independently from insulin in the human body. Xylitol has also been shown to have therapeutic properties and reportedly builds immunity, fights against chronic degenerative diseases, is anti-aging, and has no known toxic levels.<br>
In addition to its use in the food, pharmaceutical and oral health products, xylitol also finds commercial applications in plywood industries and can replace phenolic resins because of its adhesive properties.<br>
The importance of xylitol and its application in different industries requires methods for maximum production of this sugar alcohol in an efficient manner. As xylitol is present in low concentrations in vegetables or fruits its extraction is uneconomical from these sources. Commercially xylitol is produced by chemical reduction of xylose, which is a hydrolysate of hemicellulose present in woods, rice straw, millet, etc. An example of this process is described in the US Patent Number 4008285, in which the production of xylitol on a commercial scale is<br><br><br>
carried out by acid hydrolysis of pentosan-containing raw materials such as wood, corncobs, straw, bran, and cottonseed hulls. The hydrolysis of xylitol is usually carried out using Raney nickel catalyst (Ni/AbOs) at high temperature and pressure. One limitation of the chemical process is the difficulty of separation and purification of xylose or xylitol from hydrolysates of other polymer sugars derived from hemicellulose fractions. Multistep separation techniques, including mechanical filtration and chromatography are required to obtain pure xylitol. These processes adversely affect the cost of production for a yield in the range of 50-60%. Furthermore, such processes involve high temperature and high-pressure associated risks. Waste disposal due to use of acid or alkali is another major concern that is associated with chemical production of xylitol. These factors make the chemical methods for the routine production of xylitol difficult, expensive and inefficient.<br>
On the other hand biotechnological processes have the advantages of selective conversion with high yield and less toxic/nontoxic byproducts where xylose is converted into xylitol by microorganisms using NAD(P)H- dependent xylose reductase (XR).<br>
Several biological processes using microorganisms for the production of xylitol from xylose are known. A number of yeast including those of the species Pichia, Candida, Hansenula and Kluyveromyces, are capable of reducing xylose to xylitol as an initial step in their xylose metabolism/bioconversion. The production of xylitol using microorganisms has been carried out by batch, fed batch and cell recycling methods.<br>
The cost of microbial production of xylitol depends on a number of factors including the cost of fermentation medium, maintenance of fermentation conditions and cost of recovery of xylitol from the fermentation medium. Microbial methods currently available for the production of xylitol use medium containing xylose along with nutrients that facilitate cell growth. Nutrients<br><br><br>
that are added are either complex organic compounds like peptone, yeast extract etc. or chemical compounds.<br>
Since these nutrients are expensive they increase the cost of production. Moreover, by using such a medium it is difficult to efficiently and selectively remove byproducts, medium ingredients and substances derived from microorganism, from the fermentation medium and recover xylitol. This further increases the cost of xylitol production.<br>
In view of these difficulties faced in the production of xylitol, there is a need to develop an easy, cost effective and ecologically friendly method for production of xylitol.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing xylitol from xylose by a yeast strain capable of converting the xylose to xylitol comprising independently growing the yeast strain in a medium; transferring the yeast strain from the medium to a feed solution, the feed solution comprising of xylose in water, and separating the xylitol from said feed solution.<br>

Xylitol is recovered from the feed solution by common purification process.<br>
The following examples are provided to explain and illustrate certain preferred embodiments of the process of the invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
C. tropicalis ATCC 13803 was inoculated on YPX agar plate containing 50g/L xylose, lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L Bacto-peptone and 15g/L agar. Yeast strain was then inoculated into an inoculation medium containing 25g/L xylose, lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L Bacto-peptone and 25g/L glucose pH 6.0. 5% inoculum was added to the growth medium. Growth of yeast strain was carried out in a medium containing lOOg/L xylose, lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L bacto-peptone and 30g/L glucose, with pH adjusted to 6.0, at 30°C and 250rpm. Glucose and xylose were autoclaved separately and added to the media. Substrate and products were determined by HPLC equipped with Phenomenex RNM Carbohydrate Column (50 x 7.80 mm; 8 micron) and RID detector. Cell concentration was monitored turbidometrically at 600nm. Xylitol production was 47.3 g/1 (with xylitol yield of 0.5 g xylitol per gram xylose) at the end of 72 h (Figure 1 &amp; 2).<br>
Example 2<br>
C. tropicalis ATCC 13803 was inoculated on YPX agar plate containing 50g/L xylose,<br>
lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L Bacto-peptone and 15g/L agar. Cells of the yeast were then inoculated<br>
into an inoculation medium containing 25g/L xylose, lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L bacto-peptone<br>
and 25g/L glucose at pH 6.0. 5% inoculum was added to the growth medium. Xylose and<br><br><br>
glucose were supplied at the rate of 100g/l at 0 h, 72 h and 144 h and 30g/l at 0 h, 10g/l at 24 h and 5 g/1 at 72 h and 144 h respectively in the growth medium. In addition to xylose and glucose the growth medium also contained lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L bacto-peptone and its pH was adjusted to 6.0. The fermentation was carried out at a 30°C and 250rpm. Substrate and products were determined by HPLC equipped with Phenomenex RNM Carbohydrate Column (50 x 7.80 mm; 8 micron) and RID detector. Cell concentration was monitored turbidometrically at 600nm. There was 50% conversion to xylitol in 196h.<br>
Example 3<br>
The growth medium containing yeast strain from batch or fed batch culture were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. After centrifugation strain was separated from medium by decanting the supernatant. The strain was recycled back to the flask containing xylose (100-200 g/L) in water and incubated at desired temperature (26-30 °C) and rpm (150-250) on the shaker. This procedure was repeated for 4 cycles and supernatant collected on each cycle were used for analysis purpose and purification of xylitol. Results with Xylose (150 g/L ) to xylitol conversion were consistent (50 - 60%). (Fig 3 and 4 and Table 2).<br><br><br>
