The present invention relates to the field of Instant Messaging, and particularly relates to a method and system for intercommunicating chal information between an Instant Messaging (IM) group and a chat room, and the present invention further relates to an intercommunication system.<br>
 <br>
With the development of network technology, Instant Messaging (IM) has become the most popular way of network communications for network users. Besides one-to-one communications, IM can further provide a discussion among multiple users in an IM group or a chat room at present.<br>
The existing IM group system provides an effective communication platform for users in a group and is responsible for organizing and managing the users thereof. However, IM groups claim strict identity authentication for users, so that a users not belonging to an IM group can neither send/receive chat information in the IM group nor join a discussion of a topic in the IM group. In contrast, in a chat room system, a user can communicate with more than one user without identity authentication fe.g., anonymous logon), where, it is inconvenient for managing a chat room since users thereof is variable. So far, the above-mentioned two instant messaging systems are totally independent, so manual transferring operations have to be implemented if a user of an IM group desires to communicate within a larger user-group or if a user not belonging to an IM group, e.g., a chat room user, desires to paiticipate in a discussion of a topic in the IM group. However, the implementation of the manual transferring operations will consequentially lead to high costs, and the manual transferring operations, being without enough practical application, are unable to satisfy the above-mentioned desires of instant messaging users effectively.<br>
Therefore, a solution is needed to effectively implement intercommunicating chat<br>
 <br>
information between an IM group and a chat room with low costs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

The present invention is further to provide a method for intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room so as to better solve the above-mentioned problems existing in the prior art.<br>
Besides, the present invention is to provide an intercommunication system, so as to implement intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room.<br>
To realize an object of the present invention, the system for intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room, includes an IM group system and a chat room system, and further includes an intercommunication system adapted to establish a connection channel between the IM group system and the chat room system and forwarding chat information between the IM group system and the chat room system through the connection channel.<br>
To realize an object of the present invention, the medhod for intercommunicating chal information between an IM group and a chat room includes the following steps: when any party of an IM group system and a chat room system initiates a connection request for intercommunicating with the other party, establishing a connection channel between the IM group system and the chat room system according to the connection request; and, forwarding chat information between the IM group system and the chat room system through the connection channel.<br>

The said intercommunication system includes a connection managing module and an information forwarding module, wherein, the connection managing module is adapted to establish a connection channel between the IM group system and the chat room system<br>
 <br>
according to a connection request initiated by any party of the IM group system and die chat room system; and, the information forwarding module is adapted to forward chat information between the IM group system and the chat room system through the connection channel.<br>
By adding an intercommunication system between the IM group system and the chat room system to manage connections and forward information between the two systems, the embodiments of the present invention are able to implement effective and low-cost intercommunication between the IM group system and the chat room, and thus improve the variety of the instant messaging communications.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a system for intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; and.<br>
Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating a flow chart of a method for intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room in accordance with art embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Embodiments of the Invention<br>
In order to make objects, technical schemes and advantages of the present invention clearer, the present invention will be further described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings and embodiments. It should be understood that, the described embodiments hereinafter are used only to describe the present invention, while not to limit the present invention.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, an intercommunication system is added between an IM group system and a chat room system, which is for managing connections (including establishing or disconnecting a connection channel) and forwarding information between the two systems, so that the chat information can be intercommunicated between an IM group and a chat room.<br>
Figure I shows a structure of a system for intercommunicating chat information<br>
 <br>
between an IM group and a chal room in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system involves IM group system 100, chat room system 300 and intercommunication system 200 configured between IM group system 100 and chat room system 300.<br>
Wherein, IM group system 100 includes connection processing module !01 and information transmitting/receiving module 102. Connection processing module 101 is adapted for initiating a connection request for intercommunicating with chat room system 300, and/or, is adapted for authenticating a connection request initiated by chat room system 300. Information transmitting/receiving module 102 is adapted for automatically packing chal information of an IM group and transmitting the packed chat information to chat room system 300 in real time during an instant messaging procedure, and/or, is adapted for receiving chat information from chat room system 300 and displaying the received chat information. Information transmitting/receiving module 102 may be an information transmitting/receiving interface or information transceiver.<br>
In accordance with IM group system 100, chat room system 300 includes connection processing module 301 and information transmitting/receiving module 302. Wherein, connection processing module 301 is adapted for initiating a connection request for intercommunicating with IM group system 100, and/or, is adapted for authenticating the connection request initiated by IM group system 100. It should be noted that, in practical application, the present invention does not restrict the initiator of the connection request, and any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 may initiate the connection request, where the connection request may be authenticated by the other party, and the connection request may alternatively be accepted by the other party directly without authentication if security is not highly required. In addition, there may be multiple ways for initiating the connection request. For example, a user in an IM group or a chat room may be authorized to initiate the connection request. And, information transmitting/receiving module 302 is adapted for automatically packing chat information of chat room system 300 and transmitting the packed chat information to IM group system 100 in real time during an instant mes.saging procedure, and/or, is adapted for receiving chat information from IM group system 100 and displaying the received chat information. Information transmitting/receiving module 302 may be an information transmitting/receiving interface or information transceiver.<br>
 <br>
Intercommunication system 200 includes connection managing module 201 and information forwarding module 202.<br>
Wherein, connection managing module 201 is mainly adapted for establishing a connection channel between IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 as well as disconnecting the connection channel. For instance, after receiving a connection request initiated by any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300, connection managing module 201 initializes the received connection request at first, and then sends the connection request to the other party. After the other party has authenticated the connection request and returned a message indicating the two parties having been connected successfully, connection managing module 201 establishes a forwarding service according to the message indicating the two parlies having been connected successfully, and then establishes a connection channel between IM group system 100 and chat room system 300. When any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 initiates a request of disconnecdng the connecdon between the two parties, connection managing module 201 disconnects the previously-established connection channel based on a mechanism the same as the above-mentioned processes.<br>
Information forwarding module 202 is mainly adapted for forwarding chat information of one party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 to the other party during an instant messaging procedure. For example, after receiving a data packet of chat information sent automatically by any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 in real time, information forwarding module 202 first adjusts attributes of the data packet to make them in accord with those of the data packet acceptable by the other party, where the attributes adjusted may include the size, fragment, analyzing privilege and identifier of the data packet and so on, so as to implement conversion between message protocols of the two instant messaging systems, and only when the attributes of the data packet have met requirements of the receiver, can the data packet be received by the receiver with its contents being identified by the receiver. A data packet is sent to the receiver when the attributes of the data packet are adjusted to be in accord with those of the data packet acceptable by the receiver, namely, the other party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300. Of course, when IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 adopt the same message protocol, information forwarding module 202 may forward the received data packet directly without adjusting its attributes.<br>
 <br>
Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating a flow chart of a method for intercommunicating chat information between an IM group and a chat room in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, which includes the following steps.<br>
In step S201, any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 initiates a connection request for intercommunicating with the other party, and there may be multiple ways for initiating such a request. For instance, an authorized user (like an administrator) in IM group system 100 or chat room system 300 initiates a connection request through connection processing module l0l or 301. And the connection request is firstly sent to connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200.<br>
In step S202, connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200 initializes a connection according to the connection request first, and then sends [he connection request to the other party of IM group system 100 or chat room system 300. The initialization herein includes authenticating the authority of the party initiating the connection request as well as the other party to be connected, e.g., authenticating whether the IM user initiating the connection request has the authority and whether the chat room to be connected is available for connection. In some cases such as .security not highly required, connection managing module 201 may directly send the connection request to the other party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 without the above initialization.<br>
In step S203, after receiving the connection request, connection processing module of the other party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 authenticates the connection request, including authenticating validity of the connection request and etc., and then returns a message indicating the two parties having been connected successfully to connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200 after the request is successfully authenticated.<br>
In step S204, connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200 establishes a forwarding service after receiving the message indicating the two parties having been connected successfully, and forwards the message indicating the two parties having been connected successfully to the initiator of the connection request so as to establish a connection channel between IM group system 100 and chat room system 300<br>
 <br>
which may be denoted as "IM group system 100 - intercommunication system 200 - chat room system 300". The connection is successfully established so far, and chat information can be intercommunicated, where, users of an IM group and users of a chat room can conveniently transmit or receive information at their own system's interfaces, and thus information forwarding is performed by intercommunication system 200 without manually transferring between the two parties' systems.<br>
In step S205, through information transmitting/receiving module (like information transmitting/receiving module 102 in IM group system 100 or information transmitting/receiving module 302 in chat room system 300), any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300 automatically packs the chat information in local system during an instant messaging procedure and sends the packed chat information to information forwarding module 202 in intercommunication system 200 in real time. For example, typically, while chat information sent by a user of an IM group is presented in the IM group, the chat information can be automatically received by information transmitting/receiving module 102 in IM group system 100 in real time and can be transmitted to information forwarding module 202 in intercommunication system 200 for subsequent forwarding.<br>
In step S206, after receiving a data packet containing the chat information, information forwarding module 202 in intercommunicaliorv system 200 adjusts attributes of the data packet to make them in accord with those of the data packet acceptable by the other party, where the attributes adjusted may include the size, fragment, analyzing privilege and identifier of the data packet and so on, so as to implement conversion between message protocols of the two instant messaging systems, and only when the attributes of the data packet have met requirements of the receiver, can the data packet be received by the receiver with its contents being identified by the receiver. A data packet is sent to the receiver when the attributes of the data packet are adjusted to be in accord with those of the data packet acceptable by the receiver, namely, the other party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300.<br>
In step S207, after receiving the data packet containing the chat information with adjusted attributes, the receiver (i.e., IM group system 100 or chat room system 300) analyzes the data packet to get its contents (i.e., the chat information contained in the data<br>
 <br>
packet) and display the contents on the local system's chat interface. So fat, a complete procedure of chat information intercommunication is finished successfully.<br>
In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, after all the steps mentioned above, if any party of IM group system 100 and chat room system 3(X) initiates a disconnection request, the disconnection request is then forwarded to the other party to cut the connection channel, and the forwarding service is stopped. Such disconnection procedure will be illustrated hereinafter with reference to a case of a user of an IM group initialing a disconnection request. When the user of the IM group initiates a disconnecdon request, connection processing module 101 in IM group system 100 sends the disconnection request to connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200. After receiving the disconnection request from IM group system !00, connecdon managing module 201 further sends the disconnection request to connection managing module 301 in chat room system 300. After receiving the disconnection request, connection managing module 301 cuts the corresponding connection, i.e., releases the port adapted for the connection in chat room system 300, and returns a message indicating the connection between the two parties having been disconnected successfully to connection managing module 201 in intercommunication system 200. And then, connection managing module 201 stops the forwarding service of informadon forwarding module 202, and returns a feedback to connection processing module 101 in IM group system lOO, Finally, connection processing module 101 cuts the corresponding connection, namely, releases the port adapted for the connection in IM group system 100, And otherwise, if a disconnection request is initiated by a user of a chat room, the disconnection procedure is implemented in a reverse way of the above-mentioned procedure regarding a user of an IM group initiating a disconnection request, which is not to be illustrated hereby.<br>
It is remarkable that intercommunicadon system 200 is easy to implement and does not need much costs and thus makes the implementation of the intercommunication between the two types of instant messaging both effective and economical.<br>
In addition, intercommunication system 200 may exist independently of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300, or may be integrated in any one of IM group system 100 and chat room system 300, the location of which may change according to<br>
 <br>
specific situations in practical application.<br>
The above illustration is just preferable embodiments of the present invention and not used to confine the present invention. Any modification, equivalent substitute and improvement within principle of the present invention shall be in the protection scope of the present invention.<br>
