				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of evaluation of liberation<br>
characteristics of metallic/non metallic ore feeds for gravity<br>
separation.<br>
More specifically the present invention relates to recovery of mineral<br>
values form ores by gravity separation on determination of efficiency<br>
values indicative of liberation characteristics of each feed at different<br>
size fractions and comparing liberation characteristics of two graded<br>
feeds on the basis of chemical analysis of the sized fraction collected<br>
form the feed and product streams and maintaining size fractions and<br>
specific gravity cut and condition accordingly to recover maximum<br>
metal values from ore feeds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Selection of technology in mineral beneficiation largely depends on<br>
the efficiency of the unit operation and the feed characteristics.<br>
These two parameters are inter-related. A unit operation is selected<br>
based on the size distribution of the feed and the physical property<br>
which is exploited to separate the values from the gangue mineral.<br>
In spite of the these measures, process efficiency is often controlled<br><br>
by the liberation characteristics of the feed. Therefore, the<br>
evaluation of the liberation characteristics of the feed is important to<br>
mineral engineers. To emphasize this point further; the liberation<br>
characteristics of the feed provides us invaluable information like: (i)<br>
yield of the desired quality concentrate, (ii) probable effect of size<br>
reduction on yield and finally (iii) feasibility of the entire process<br>
technology.<br>
Liberation characteristic of feed that is treated in a gravity separator<br>
is studied through (a) float - sink method and (b) microscopical<br>
analysis. In a coal washery, the float - sink analysis is known as<br>
washability test. Washability test of coal indicates the theoretical<br>
yield of the clean coal corresponding to the specific gravity cut for<br>
the desired clean coal ash level. In relative scale, higher theoretical<br>
yield indicates better liberation. Theoretical yield for different size<br>
fraction provides far more insight to liberation characteristics of the<br>
feed. Microscopical analysis is a part of very detail liberation study.<br>
It shows the prospect of mineral liberation with gradual size<br>
reduction. The said analysis is demerited that the process is very<br>
lengthy and time consuming. Therefore this exercise is usually done<br>
only when a new coal seam is made exposed for mining.<br><br>
However analysis of liberation characteristics of most of the metallic<br>
or non-metallic ore poses serious challenge as the availability of<br>
heavy liquids required for carrying out the float-sink tests of these<br>
heavy minerals are rare. Among metallic minerals iron ore mining is<br>
most common. In iron ore beneficiation, sink-float tests for the feed<br>
and the products are not always feasible due to very high specific<br>
gravity of gangue particles. Clerici solution is used in few cases to<br>
carry out the sink-float tests of iron ores. The same solution cannot<br>
be used either repetitively or for bigger volume of sample, as the<br>
above solution is costly and unsafe for use. Sink-float test using<br>
ferro-silicon based heavy media is also not feasible as specific gravity<br>
cut for most of the iron ore is higher. As mentioned earlier the<br>
microscopical analysis can not be conducted on daily basis.<br>
Therefore, in an alternative approach the recovery of iron is<br>
considered as the yardstick for evaluation of liberation characteristics.<br>
This is an indirect method for evaluation of the liberation<br>
characteristics and the method is described in detail with iron ore as<br>
a case study. This method is universally applicable for all<br>
metallic/non-metallic ore types.<br>
This method was used to evaluate the liberation characteristics of<br>
three different iron ore feeds. These feeds are high-, medium- and<br>
low-grade iron ore feed with alumina content in the range of 2.2-2.8,<br>
2.8-3.4 and 3.4-5.4% respectively. All these three feeds are in the<br><br>
size range of - 10 + 0.5mm and were treated in a 300 t/hr capacity<br>
jig. This jig was optimised based on the fundamental understanding<br>
of iron ore jigging. To evaluate liberation characteristics of the three<br>
different types of feed, samples were collected from the feed,<br>
concentrate and the reject streams of the jig. Samples were drawn<br>
at an interval of two hours for two shifts in a day. All samples<br>
collected in a day were then mixed together to form a composite<br>
sample for the day. These composite samples were chemically<br>
analysed for total iron, alumina, silica, phosphorus and LOI (Loss on<br>
Ignition). Plant trial was carried out for long duration with each fed<br>
so as to generate sufficient data for subsequent statistical analysis.<br>
Average alumina content in the feed and jig products for each of the<br>
three feeds are plotted. Based on the alumina content in feed and<br>
products, iron recovery values were calculated for each day. Average<br>
iron recovery values in the concentrate were calculated for all the<br>
three feeds. However, these values can not be used for any<br>
comparison as the corresponding alumina content in the concentrate<br>
varies widely. An improved statistical method is used to normalize<br>
the recovery values with respect to the alumina content in the<br>
concentrates for all three feeds and then they were compared. In<br>
this method the alumina content of the concentrate and the<br>
corresponding recovery values were used to develop the basic linear<br>
regression model for all three feeds. In this type of model it is<br><br>
assumed that the expected response value (recovery) is a linear<br>
function of the independent value (alumina content in the<br>
concentrate). In the present invention correlation coefficient values<br>
were statistically tested for the correctness of the linearization model<br>
of recovery - grade relation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One objective of the invention is to instead of studying liberation<br>
characteristic of ore feed for mineral beneficiation by gravity<br>
separation through the route of sink-float tests of the entire feed as<br>
well as different size fraction of the feed, the said liberation<br>
characteristics of ore minerals are studied through an indirect<br>
method.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to employ a statistical method to<br>
normalize the recovery values of iron in the concentrates with respect<br>
to the impurity content in the concentrates for three graded and<br>
comparing is possible only after developing a basic linear regression<br>
curves for the three feeds through functional linear relationship<br>
between response value (recovery) and independent value impurity<br>
level in the concentrate and statistically testing for the correctness of<br>
the linearizaion curve (model) for the recovery grade through<br>
correlation coefficient values.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to prepare the regression<br>
lines on the basis of intercept and the slope values, which are<br>
statistically tested for their correctness being a function of liberation<br>
characteristics and the effect of liberation characteristics are<br>
estimated based on the difference between the intercepts after<br>
normalizing the slopes of the two linear regression models.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to regress the liberation<br>
characteristics of feeds by adjusting the slopes and then comparing<br>
the recovery difference during process of normalizing of regression<br>
lines for recovery.<br>
A still further objective of the invention is to determine impurity<br>
rejection values of reject such as alumina from chemical assay values<br>
of the feed and jig products for all the three types of feed namely<br>
high-, medium-and low-grade of iron ores when firstly the<br>
concentrate yield of the process of recovery is calculated as<br><br>
where f, c, t are the percentage of alumina in the feed, concentrate<br>
and reject respectively, the recovery of non-alumina fraction (Rc2)<br>
being determined by<br><br><br>
indicates the iron recovery and alumina rejection (Rt1) is determined<br>
by<br><br>
plotting iron recovery value against the impurity rejection value of all<br>
three feed types to generate trend lines for all types of feed which<br>
are indicative of their liberation characteristics.<br>
A still yet another objective of the invention is to evaluate the<br>
liberation characteristic of feed by employing an indicator called as<br>
separation efficiency being a function of mineral value recovery and<br>
impurity rejection in the concentrate, the separation efficiency being<br>
determined based on alumina content in the feed and in the products<br>
by estimating impurity recovery (Rc1) from Rc1 = 100 - Rt1 and finally<br>
separation efficiency (x) from x = Rc2 - Rc1, thus providing a reliable<br>
method to calculate the maximum recovery of mineral values such as<br>
iron and maximum rejection of impurity bearing mineral such as<br>
alumina bearing gangue minerals by keeping high separation<br>
efficiency through appropriate maintenance of specific gravity cut &gt;<br>
2.9 gm/cc of the media in the separation of mineral values by gravity<br>
separation fed with mineral feeds.<br><br>
A still further yet another objective of the invention is to recover<br>
mineral values form ores by gravity separation on determination of<br>
separation efficiency values indicative of liberation characteristics of<br>
each feed at different size fraction and comparing liberation<br>
characteristics of two feeds on the basis of chemical analysis of the<br>
size fraction collected from the feed and product streams thus not<br>
requiring sink-float tests and maintaining the size fraction and<br>
specific gravity cut accordingly to recover maximum metal values<br>
from ore feeds.<br>
Similar to the other mineral processing unit operations, in this case of<br>
developing regression model also the recovery - grade relations are<br>
linear. In linear models, the intercept and the slope values are the<br>
unknown parameters that determine the line. Therefore, in each<br>
case the intercept and the slope values were statistically tested for<br>
their correctness and also for their compatibility for comparison. The<br>
slope and the intercept value in each case is a function of the<br>
liberation characteristics as same jig operating condition was<br>
maintained in all three cases. In the present method at first slope of<br>
the two linear models are normalized and then the effect of the<br>
liberation characteristics were estimated based on the difference<br>
between the intercepts. In this study, the high - and the low - grade<br>
feeds are compared separately with the medium - grade feed as<br>
medium feed is considered as standard feed. Three major steps<br><br>
followed in the calculation procedures are: (a) establishing a linear<br>
relationship between the recovery and the concentrate grade, (b)<br>
fitting of regression lines through a pooled gradient value, and (c)<br>
finding out the separation between the lines which indicates the<br>
recovery difference between the two feed types under comparison.<br>
The present invention will be better understood from the following<br>
description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 represents average alumina content in feed and jig products<br>
for three different type of feeds according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 (a) represents difference in Fe (total) recovery between high<br>
and medium grade feed as shown in recovery concentrate Vs alumina<br>
concentrate linear curve according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 (b) represent difference in Fe (total) recovery between<br>
medium and low-grade feed as shown in concentrate recovery Vs<br>
concentrate alumina liner curve according to the existing art.<br>
Figure 3 represents in plot of Fe recovery Vs alumina rejection for<br>
three different types of feed according to the invention.<br><br>
Figure 4 represent alumina content in different size fraction of<br>
medium-and low-grade feeds.<br>
Figure 5 represents sizewise separation efficiency values for three<br>
different types of feed tested in the jigging plant according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The manner of fittment of regression lines with pooled gradients is<br>
schematically explained for the high- and medium-grade feeds in<br>
Figures 2(a) and 2(b). Figure 2(b) explains the recovery difference<br>
between the medium- and the low-grade feed. In both these figures,<br>
the regression lines are shown as line joining points. The dotted<br>
lines are derived from the main regression lines after they are fitted<br>
with pooled gradient.<br>
In case of Figure 2(a), first regression lines were drawn for the high-<br>
and the medium-grade feed relating iron recovery and alumina<br>
content in the concentrate. These regressin lines are marked by<br>
points in the figure. These regression lines in the present form<br>
cannot be used to compare in iron recovery at certain alumina level.<br>
It is possible only when the slope of these two lines is same. This is<br>
made possible through pooled gradient method. In this method, at<br>
first gradients of these two lines were statistically tested for their<br>
compatibility for finding out the pooled (common) gradients. In the<br><br>
next step, regression lines are modified with new slope with each line<br>
passing through the corresponding average iron recovery and<br>
alumina content in the concentrate.<br>
The fitted regression lines are used for comparison. Estimation of<br>
liberation characteristics through basic regression line method is far<br>
superior to the mean recovery method.<br>
Evaluation of liberation characteristics of ore feeds are carried<br>
through three different types of ore feeds that constitutes Raw Of<br>
Mine (ROM) which are shown in Table 1.<br>
Compositionally, the high grade ROM consisted of 60 - 80% hard ore<br>
and the rest is lateritic hard ore. Medium-grade ROM contains 20 -<br>
30% hard ore, 60 - 70% lateritic hard ore and 0 - 10% soft ore.<br>
The low - grade ROM contains 50 - 60% lateritic hard ore and 50 -<br>
40% soft ore. In the present study - 10 + 0.5 mm size fraction from<br>
three different types of ROM were treated in jig. These feeds ore<br>
termed as high -, medium - and low - grade jig feed as they are<br>
derived from the high -, medium - and low - grade ROM<br>
respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Remarks	14.12% more	8.52% less iron<br>
iron recovery in	recovery in the<br>
the concentrate	concentrate for<br>
for the high-	low-grade feed<br>
grade feed as	as compared to<br>
compared to	the medium-<br>
the medium-	grade feed,<br>
grade feed.<br>
The result show iron recovery is 14.12% more for the high-grade<br>
feed as compared to the medium-grade feed. Conversely, iron<br>
recovery for the low-grade feed is 8.52% less than the medium-<br>
grade feed.<br>
In both cases the recovery difference remains same across different<br>
levels of alumina content in the concentrate. Thus, recovery<br>
difference as measure for evaluation of liberation characteristics of<br>
feed is often misleading. The linear relationship between the<br>
recovery and the concentrate grade is feed specific and it indicates<br>
liberation characteristics of feed. A gentle positive slope of the line<br>
indicates poor liberation in the feed. Conversely, a high positive<br>
slope of the line indicates that a part of the feed is liberated. In this<br>
study, regression lines showing linear relationship between recovery<br>
and grade for three different feeds are different (see Figure 2a &amp; b).<br><br>
The high-grade feed shows the least liberation and the liberation<br>
characteristics are most favourable for the medium-grade feed.<br>
However, during the process of normalization the slopes are adjusted<br>
and then compared the recovery difference; there by suppressed the<br>
vital liberation characteristics of feeds. Furthermore this method<br>
compares only the iron recovery difference instead of both, iron<br>
recovery and alumina rejection; this may as well mislead the<br>
inference on liberation characteristics of feed.<br>
Process of normalisation of regression curves are described as<br>
follows:-<br>
At first correlation coefficients for both feed types were found out.<br>
Secondly, significance of the correlation coefficients was tested for<br>
each case. Thirdly, significance of the error values for both cases<br>
was tested. Fourthly, intercept value were calculated. In the fifth<br>
step, the gradient values were calculated for each case and the<br>
significance of their difference was tested. In the sixth step, a<br>
pooled gradient was calculated and the regression lines were<br>
modified with the pooled gradient value. With this step, the feed<br>
under comparison was normalized and was made ready for<br>
comparison. Finally, the separation between the lines was calculated<br>
and it indicates the concentrate yield difference at same level of<br>
alumina content in the concentrate.<br><br><br><br>
[Note: In the present invention recovery values were used for<br>
comparison as against yield value as shown in Table 3 for obvious<br>
reason].<br>
PROPOSED METHOD<br>
Therefore, in the next step alumina rejection values were calculated<br>
from chemical assay values of the feed and the jig products for all<br>
three types of feed.<br>
In the first step the concentrate yield for the process is calculated as<br><br>
Where, f, c and t are the percentage of alunima in the feed,<br>
concentrate and reject respectively.<br>
The recovery of non-alumina fraction (Rc2) is<br><br>
In this case, (Rc-2) value indicates the iron recovery<br>
Then alumina rejection (Rt1) is,<br><br><br>
Iron recovery is plotted against the alumina rejection for all three<br>
feed types in Figure 3. Trend line in each case is indicative of their<br>
liberation characteristics. The slope of the trend line for the high-<br>
grade feed is the maximum and it suggests poor liberation for the<br>
high-grade feed as compared to other two feeds.<br>
Therefore, for better evaluation method used the liberation<br>
characteristics, which is a function of iron recovery and alumina<br>
rejection in the concentrate. Precisely, in the formula alumina<br>
recovery is used in place of alumina rejection to measure the<br>
efficiency. The method does not involve complexities of statistical<br>
analysis and also does not introduce error in the final result through<br>
normalisation step. The said indicator is called as separation<br>
efficiency and it was calculated based on alumina content in the feed<br>
and in the products.<br>
To calculate separation efficiency, alumina recovery (Rc1) is calculated<br>
as<br><br>
As per equation 5, the essential conditions for high separation<br>
efficiency are maximum recovery of iron minerals and maximum<br><br>
rejection of alumina bearing material which is gangue minerals. This<br>
is possible for feed with favourable liberation characteristics.<br>
Separation efficiency values for each day were calculated. It was<br>
found that the average separation efficiency value for the high-,<br>
medium-and low-grade feeds are 15.74, 25.44 and 28.38<br>
respectively.<br>
Plant result show recovery for the high-grade feed is 14.12% higher<br>
than the medium grade feed. However the separation efficiency<br>
value for the high-grade feed is less than the medium-grade feed.<br>
This is due to the difference in the method of calculation; the<br>
separation efficiency based calculation takes into account the<br>
recovery of iron and alumina and depicts better representation of the<br>
liberation characteristics than just iron recovery based analysis. Low<br>
separation efficiency of the high-grade feed is due to less rejection of<br>
alumina bearing minerals from the concentrate.<br>
Similarly, concentrate recovery of the medium-grade feed is 8.52%<br>
higher than the low-grade feed. Low yield for the low-grade feed is<br>
due to its high alumina content in the feed. Figure 4 shows alumina<br>
content is high in all size fractions for low-grade feed as compared to<br>
the medium-grade feed. However, overall separation efficiency value<br>
for the low-grade feed is higher than the medium-grade feed and it<br>
indicates liberation characteristic of the low-grade feed is better than<br><br>
the medium-grade feed. This is also reflected in the size wise<br>
separation efficiency values as plotted in Figure 5.<br>
The invention as herein narrated with an exemplary embodiment<br>
should not be read and constructed in a restrictive manner as various<br>
modifications, alterations and adaptations are possible within the<br>
ambit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A METHOD TO EVALUATE BENEFICATION PLANT<br>
PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT FEEbS FOR A DEFINITE<br>
PERIOD AND A COMPARISON OF FEED LIBERATION<br>
CHARACTERISTICS<br>
This invention relates to a method to evaluate benefication plant performance of<br>
different feeds for a definite period and a comparison of feed liberation<br>
characteristics comprising the steps of preparing a linear regression curve for<br>
three grade feeds of difference size fractions, determining impurity rejection<br>
values of reject, determining recovery of impurity fraction in the concentrate<br>
mathematically dependent on iron recovery, subsequently evaluating liberation<br>
characteristics of feed by employing an indicator (separation efficiency) being a<br>
function of mineral value recovery and impurity rejection in the concentrate, the<br>
said separation efficiency being determined by estimating impurity recovery<br>
mathematically and thus ensuring recovery of mineral values such as iron and<br>
maximum rejection of mineral as gangue on maintaining appropriate size<br>
fractions of feed and product streams, specific gravity cut and condition in the<br>
separation media.</td>
