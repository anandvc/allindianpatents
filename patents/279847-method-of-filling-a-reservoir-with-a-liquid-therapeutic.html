				<td>ADHESIVE AND PERIPHERAL SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This application relates generally to adhesive and peripheral systems and methods for medical devices.<br>
 <br>
Background<br>
Many potentially valuable medicines or compounds, including biologicals, are not orally active due to poor absorption, hepatic metabolism or other pharmacokinetic factors. Additionally, some therapeutic compounds, although they can be orally absorbed, are sometimes required to be administered so often it is difficult for a patient to maintain the desired schedule. In these cases, parenteral delivery is often employed or could be employed.<br>
Effective parenteral routes of drug delivery, as well as other fluids and compounds, such as subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection, and intravenous (IV) administration include puncture of the skin with a needle or stylet. Insulin is an example of a therapeutic fluid that is self-injected by millions of diabetic patients. Users of parenterally delivered drugs would benefit from a wearable device that would automatically deliver needed drugs/compounds over a period of time.<br>
To this end, there have been efforts to design portable devices for the controlled release of therapeutics. Such devices are known to have a reservoir such as a cartridge, syringe, or bag, and to be electronically controlled. These devices suffer from a number of drawbacks including the malfunction rate. Reducing the size, weight and cost of these devices is also an ongoing challenge.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a repeater system is provided for controlling a medical device. Such a system may include a repeater and a user interface. The repeater may include circuitry (i) for, over a given range, receiving signals from at least one wearable medical device, (ii) for, over the given range, transmitting signals to the wearable medical device, (iii) for, over a longer range exceeding the given range, transmitting the received signals to a user interface located remotely from the patient, and (iv) for, over the longer range, receiving signals from the user interface. The user interface may include circuitry (i) for receiving signals from the repeater, and (ii) for transmitting signals to the repeater. The medical devices may be wearable or implanted devices.<br>
In some embodiments, the user interface's circuitry may also provide for the reception of signals directly from the wearable device and the transmission of signals<br>
 <br>
directly to the wearable device. Also, the repeater's circuitry may be adapted to receive signals from multiple medical devices.<br>
In some embodiments, the repeater may include one or more of the following: memory for logging received data, a processor for analyzing received data for the presence of a fault condition, and an alarm for notifying a user of the presence of a fault condition. The fault condition may include an occurrence of an event wherein the repeater is separated from the wearable medical device by more than the given range.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a repeater is adapted to control a patch-sized pump worn on a subject for delivering fluid to the subject. In this embodiment, the repeater may have circuitry (i) for, over a given range, receiving signals from the pump, the received signals containing data relating to a volume of fluid delivered by the pump and relating to an alarm condition, and (ii) for, over a longer range exceeding the given range, transmitting the received signals to an interface for monitoring the volume of fluid delivered and the alarm condition. Such a repeater's circuitry may also provide for, over the longer range, receiving control signals from the interface, the control signals containing control information for controlling the pump, and for, over the given range, transmitting the control signals to the pump.<br>
Such a repeater may have the characteristics of the repeater described above in connection with the repeater system. In addition to or in instead of having an alarm for an occurrence of an event wherein the repeater is separated from the wearable medical device by more than the given range, the repeater may also include an alarm for a flow occlusion or an air bubble detected in the pump.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an adhesive patch system is provided for affixation of an object to a human body. Such an adhesive patch system may include two sets of adhesive members. In a first set of three or more members, each member includes an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of pressure, the members disposed around a central region. Similarly, in the second set of three or more members, each member includes an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of<br>
 <br>
pressure, the members disposed around the central region. The members of the first set are spaced to allow the members of the second set to attach to the body in spaces provided between the members of the first set, and the members of the second set are spaced to allow members of the first set to detach from the body without detaching the members of the second set.<br>
In one embodiment of the adhesive patch system at least one member is perforated so as to allow facile tearing off of the member. Tearing off of the member may relieve irritation of the underlying skin. Also, the central region is adapted to secure a wearable medical device. The adhesive patch may be semicircular. The adhesive patch may include a peelable backing strip. The members of the adhesive patch system may be attached to the central region by a fiber. The members of the first set may be a first color while the members of the second set may be a second color different from the first color.<br>
Such an adhesive patch system may be used to attach an object to a human body by a method that includes the steps of: providing the first set of three or more members (each member of which, as noted above, includes an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of pressure, the members being disposed around a central region); attaching the first set of members to the body so that spaces are left between each of the members, so as to hold the object against the body; providing a second set of three or more members (each member of which includes an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of pressure, the members being disposed around the central region); attaching the second set of members to the body in the spaces between the members of the first set, so as to hold the object against the body with the second set of members; and after attaching the second set of members to the body, removing the first set of members from the body.<br>
The object being attached may be a pump for therapeutic of fluid to the body through the skin. A cannula of such a pump may be passed through the skin to permit delivery of the fluid from the pump through the skin. In a preferred embodiment of the method, the cannula is not moved and is left passing through the skin while the<br>
 <br>
second set of members is attached to the body and while the first set of members is removed from the body.<br>
Similarly, the object being attached may be a probe for measuring a parameter in the body through the skin. Such a probe may be passed through the skin. In a preferred embodiment of the method, the probe is not moved and is left passing through the skin while the second set of members is attached to the body and while the first set of members is removed from the body.<br>
The object being attached in such an adhesive patch system may be provided with air passages to permit airflow to the body under the object when the object is attached to the body.<br>
An alternative adhesion system for affixing an object to a human body includes a central member adapted to secure a wearable object and having an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of pressure, and includes a plurality of peripheral members, each member including an adhesive material on at least one side so as to attach to the body upon application of pressure, wherein fibrous connectors are provided for connecting each of the peripheral members to the central member. In a preferred embodiment, the fibrous connectors are elastic.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for filling a reservoir with a liquid therapeutic. Such a method may include providing a fill station having a substantially rigid fill-station base for holding the reservoir at a tilt, and a substantially rigid fill-station cover attached to the fill-station base. The fill-station cover has a filling aperture for receiving fluid from a syringe. The fill-station cover and the fill-station base define a volume so as to prevent over-filling of the reservoir. Such a method also includes placing a reservoir in the fill station, closing the fill-station cover over the reservoir, applying a syringe containing the liquid therapeutic to the filling aperture, and ejecting the liquid therapeutic from the syringe through the filling aperture into the reservoir. In a preferred embodiment, any air in the reservoir after the ejection step is removed. A window may be provided in the fill station cover<br>
 <br>
to view the amount of liquid in the reservoir. The amount of liquid may be estimated by comparing the liquid level viewed through the window to a fluid-level indicia.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a base station is provided for a patch-sized infusion device, wherein the infusion device includes a disposable portion and a reusable portion, and the disposable portion and the reusable portion are connectable to each other via an attachment mechanism associated with the reusable portion. The base station includes a receptacle for holding the reusable portion of the infusion device, the receptacle including a member for cooperating with the reusable portion's attachment mechanism. The base station may also include a recharger for recharging a battery in the reusable portion. The base station may also include a communication interface between a separate computer and the reusable portion, in order to upload information to or download information from the reusable portion.<br>

Embodiments of the device, pumping mechanism, system and methods described herein relate to fluid delivery including pumping and volume measurement of fluid as well as the actuation and control of same. Embodiments of the device include a portable or non-portable device for fluid delivery. Some embodiments of the device include a base portion that is disposable and a top portion that is non-disposable. The device includes embodiments where an infusion device is inserted through the base portion and directly into a patient. These device embodiments are patch pump devices. The patch pump may be adhered to the patient using an adhesive, a strap, or other suitable arrangement.   The adhesive may have a protective peelable strip which may be removed to expose the adhesive prior to use.<br>
 <br>
However, in other embodiments, the fluid delivery device is a portable device where tubing is connected to a fluid line. The tubing is typically connected to a patient through a cannula.<br>
In some embodiments where a disposable base and non-disposable top are implemented, the base portion includes parts that are wetted, while the parts included in the non-disposable top portion are typically non-wetted parts.<br>
Various embodiments of the pumping mechanism include an upstream inlet valve, a pumping actuation member, a downstream exit valve and a moveable member. In some embodiments, the pumping actuation member and downstream valve functions are implemented using the same device. The pumping mechanism pumps fluid from a reservoir through a fluid line to an exit. The pumping mechanism is typically employed with a non-pressurized reservoir, however, the scope of the present invention is not limited accordingly.<br>
In one embodiment of the fluid delivery system, the device includes an analyte sensor housing. An analyte sensor is introduced into the patient through the analyte sensor housing of the base portion of the device. In these embodiments, an infusion device is also introduced through a cannula housing on the base portion of the device. In these embodiments, the device is worn by the user as a patch pump.<br>
The system typically includes a controller, which may include a wireless transceiver. Thus, the device may be controlled exclusively or in part through a wireless controller device. The controller device may receive information through wireless communication from the analyte sensor and/or the fluid delivery device. The patient or a third party can control the function of the fluid delivery device using the controller device.<br>
In one embodiment of the fluid delivery device, the device is an insulin pump and the analyte sensor is a blood glucose sensor. The controller, receiving information relating both to the volume of insulin delivered (or the number of pump strokes<br>
 <br>
over time) and blood glucose data, assists the user in programming the actuation schedule for the pump mechanism.<br>
An exemplary dispensing assembly and volume sensing device is described herein. The dispensing assembly includes at least one microphone and a loudspeaker. The assembly determines the volume change in a dispensing chamber to determine the volume of fluid pumped. The volume sensing data is used to determine the status of the fluid delivery device. Thus, various controls may rely on the volume sensing data.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a user configures the fluid-delivery device via a user interface in order to cause the fluid-delivery device to deliver a fluid in an appropriate manner. In one embodiment, the user interface resides on a separate hand-held user-interface assembly that may communicate wirelessly with the patch. The patch may be disposable, or partially disposable.<br>
An exemplary use of embodiments of the device is for the delivery of insulin to diabetic patients, but other uses include delivery of any fluid, as described above. Fluids include analgesics to those in pain, chemotherapy to cancer patients and enzymes to patients with metabolic disorders. Various therapeutic fluids may include small molecules, natural products, peptide, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, nanoparticulate suspensions, and associated pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier molecules. Therapeutically active molecules may be modified to improve stability in the delivery device (e.g., by pegylation of peptides or proteins). Although illustrative embodiments herein describe drug-delivery applications, embodiments may be used for other applications including liquid dispensing of reagents for high throughput analytical measurements such as lab-on-chip applications and capillary chromatography. For purposes of description below, terms "therapeutic" or "fluid" are used interchangeably, however, in other embodiments, any fluid, as described above, can be used. Thus, the device and description included herein are not limited to use with therapeutics.<br>
Typical embodiments include a reservoir for holding a supply of fluid. In the case of insulin, the reservoir may be conveniently sized to hold an insulin supply<br>
 <br>
sufficient for delivery over one or more days. For example, a reservoir may hold about 1 to 2 ml of insulin. A 2 ml insulin reservoir may correspond to about 3 days supply for about 90% of potential users. In other embodiments, the reservoir can be any size or shape and can be adapted to hold any amount of insulin or other fluid. In some embodiments, the size and shape of the reservoir is related to the type of fluid the reservoir is adapted to hold. The fluid reservoir may be eccentrically or irregularly shaped and/or may be keyed in order to deter incorrect installation or usage.<br>
Some embodiments of the fluid delivery device are adapted for use by diabetics, thus, in these embodiments, the device delivers insulin which supplements or replaces the action of the patient's pancreatic islet beta cells. Embodiments adapted for insulin delivery seek to mimic the action of the pancreas by providing both a basal level of fluid delivery as well as bolus levels of delivery. Basal levels, bolus levels and timing can be set by the patient or another party by using a wireless handheld user interface. Additionally, basal and/or bolus levels can be triggered or adjusted in response to the output of an integral or external analyte sensor, such as a glucose monitoring device or blood glucose sensor. In some embodiments, a bolus can be triggered by a patient or third party using a designated button or other input means located on the fluid-delivery device. In still other embodiments, the bolus or basal can be programmed or administered through a user interface located on the fluid delivery device.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a patient 12 wearing a fluid-delivery device 10 and holding a wireless user interface assembly 14 for monitoring and adjusting operation of the fluid-delivery device 10, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The user interface assembly 14 typically includes apparatus for entering information (such as touch-screen or keypad) and for transmitting information to the user (such as an LCD display, a speaker or a vibrating alarm). The fluid delivery device is typically small and lightweight enough to remain comfortably adhered to the patient for several days.<br>
The fluid delivery device 10 is shown worn on the arm of a patient 12 in FIG. 1. In other embodiments, the fluid-delivery device 10 may be worn at other positions<br>
 <br>
on the patient where the particular fluid being delivered can be utilized advantageously by the patient's body. For example, fluid may be delivered advantageously to the patient's abdominal area, kidney area, leg or otherwise.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2 A, a schematic representation of a fluid delivery device 10 having a feedback loop 360 from a dispensing assembly 120 to a pumping assembly 16 is shown.   The pumping assembly 16 pumps fluid to the dispensing assembly 120; the fluid then exits through an exit assembly 17, which includes a flow restrictor 340 and an output. The output typically includes a cannula and leads to a patient. The dispensing assembly 120 may include a resilient, variable-volume dispensing chamber and at least one microphone and a loudspeaker for measuring parameters related to flow through the output over time. The feedback loop 360 allows adjustment of the operation of the pumping assembly 16 based on repeated measurements made by the sensor. The flow restrictor 340 creates high impedance between the dispensing assembly 120 and the output of the flow line 5010. The flow restrictor 340 could be, for example, a section of narrow-bore tubing or microtubing. Referring now to FIG. 2B, in one embodiment, the pumping assembly 16 pumps fluid from a reservoir 20 to a dispensing assembly 120.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram of a further embodiment employing fluidic principles is shown. A flow line 310 couples a reservoir 20, a pumping assembly 16, a dispensing assembly 120, and an exit assembly 17. The exit assembly 17 may include a high impedance flow restrictor 340 and an infusion device 5010 - for example, a cannula. The output of the flow restrictor 340 is sent to the infusion device 5010 for delivery to a patient. The flow restrictor 340 has a higher flow impedance than that of the portion of the flow line 310 upstream of the dispensing assembly 120. Therefore, the pumping assembly 16 is capable of pumping fluid into the dispensing assembly 120 faster than the fluid can exit the exit assembly 17. The dispensing assembly 120 may include a variable volume dispensing chamber 122 having a resilient wall. In embodiments presented below, the resilient wall is a membrane. Examples of membrane materials include silicone, NITRILE, and any other material having desired resilience and properties for functioning as described here:n. Additionally, other structures could serve the<br>
 <br>
same purpose. Upon receiving a charge of fluid as a result of the action of the pumping assembly 16, the resilience of the membrane will allow the chamber 122 to first expand and then to provide the delivery pressure required to drive the fluid contents of the dispensing assembly 120 past the flow restrictor 340 to a patient. When equipped with an appropriate sensor (examples of which are described below), the dispensing assembly 120 may measure fluid flow through the variable volume dispensing chamber 122 and may provide feedback through the feedback loop 360 to control the timing and/or rate at which the pumping assembly 16 pumps'or partially fills the dispensing chamber 122, thereby delivering a desired dose at a desired rate to a patient.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 3, additionally, the flow restrictor 340 prevents fluid flow above a specified flow rate. Furthermore, since pressurized fluid delivery is accomplished through the interaction of the pumping assembly 16, the dispensing assembly 120, and the flow restrictor 340, a non pressurized reservoir 20 can be employed.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 3, the feedback loop 360 may include a controller 501. The controller 501 may include a processor and control circuitry for actuating a pumping assembly 16 to pump fluid to the dispensing assembly 120. The controller 501 repeatedly receives a parameter related to fluid flow from a sensor, which may be integral to the dispensing assembly 120, and uses this parameter to control the pumping assembly 16 to achieve a desired flow through the output. For example, the controller 501 can adjust the timing or extent of actuation of the pumping assembly 16 to achieve a desired basal or bolus flow rate and/or to deliver a desired basal or bolus cumulative dose. In determining the timing or extent of pumping, the controller 501 may use the output of the sensor (not shown) to estimate (amongst other things) the rate of fluid flow, cumulative fluid flow, or both, and then, based on the estimation, determine an appropriate compensatory action. In the various embodiments, pumping may occur in pulses which can deliver anywhere between 10 "9 liters per pulse to microliters per pulse.<br>
 <br>
A basal or bolus dose may be achieved by delivering multiple pulses. (Examples of basal and bolus dosing are shown and described below).<br>
The use of a partially collapsible non pressurized reservoir 20 may advantageously prevent the buildup of air in the reservoir as the fluid in the reservoir is depleted. The reservoir 20 may be connected to the fluid line 310 through a septum (not shown). Air buildup in a vented reservoir could prevent fluid egress from the reservoir 20, especially if the system is tilted so that an air pocket intervenes between the fluid contained in the reservoir and the septum of the reservoir 20. Tilting of the system is expected during normal operation as a wearable device.   FIGS. 104-106C depict various embodiments and views of one embodiment of the reservoir. Additionally, further description of the reservoir is included below.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 4A-4C, various embodiments of the flow restrictor 340 are shown. Referring now to FIG. 4A, the flow restrictor is a molded flow channel 340, which may be a molded groove in a base (not shown). In one embodiment, the cross section of the molded flow channel 340 is approximately 0.009 inches. In this embodiment, the flow restrictor 340 is molded into an apparatus. Referring now to FIG. 4B, microtubing 340 is shown as an alternate embodiment flow restrictor. In one embodiment, the microtubing has an internal diameter of approximately 0.009 inches. Both the molded flow channel and the microtubing use a long path having a small internal diameter or cross section to impart flow impendence. Referring now to FIG. 4C, a precision orifice is shown as a flow restrictor 340. In one embodiment, the precision orifice is a plate with a laser drilled hole.   In alternate embodiments, any flow impendence device or method known in the art can be used.<br>
In contrast to prior-art fluid delivery systems that have an active downstream valve, which may be generally considered to create, in a functional sense, an infinite fluid impedance, the flow restrictor 340 creates a finite fluid impedance. The impedance is also normally present; in contrast to prior-art systems than may occasionally be impeded due to an occlusion. As a result of the finite nature of<br>
 <br>
the fluid impedance, in embodiments that include a dispensing chamber 122, fluid may leak through the exit even while the dispensing chamber 122 is expanding.<br>
FIGS. 5-8 schematically show sectional views of illustrative embodiments of the dispensing assembly 120. It is to be understood that the delivery of fluid for other purposes, such as industrial processes, is within the scope of the present invention, and that the description in particular terms is by way of example only. As shown in FIG. 5, the dispensing assembly 120 may include the variable volume dispensing chamber 122 and a sensor 550. The variable volume dispensing chamber 122 includes a resilient dispensing diaphragm 125, which allows the chamber 122 to expand and contract depending on the flow of fluid into and out of the dispensing assembly 120. In certain embodiments of the invention, the variable-volume dispensing chamber 122 may be detachable from other elements of the dispensing assembly 120, as further discussed herein. The concept of the resilient dispensing diaphragm 125 allowing the chamber 122 to expand and contract is illustrated by the double headed arrow. Metering chamber 122 is considered to comprise a portion of a line 110 characterized by a fluid flow, which is designated, in FIG. 5, by arrow 112. Neither the position nor the nature of the termination of fluid flow 112 or line 110 need limit the scope of the present invention as claimed in certain of the claims appended hereto. The flow restrictor 340 causes fluid to leave the dispensing chamber 122 more slowly than fluid enters the chamber 122 when pumped into the chamber 122 by the pumping assembly 16. As a consequence, the dispensing chamber 122 expands and is pressurized as a fluid charge enters. Dispensing diaphragm 125, deformed by virtue of the expansion of dispensing chamber 122, provides the force needed to deliver the metered volume past the flow restrictor 340 to the exit assembly 17. As discussed above, the sensor 550 repeatedly measures a parameter, such as a displacement, or a thermodynamic variable or capacitance, that can be related to the volume of the resilient dispensing chamber 122. The volume measurements produced by the sensor 550 may be used to control, through a feedback loop, the timing and rate at which the pumping assembly pumps fluid to the dispensing chamber 122 so that the proper flow of fluid is delivered to exit assembly 17 and to a subsequent line, and thence, for example, to the patient.  The sensor 550 may employ, for example, acoustic volume sensing (described in more detail below),<br>
 <br>
or other methods (optical, or capacitive, for other examples) for determining a volume, or a volume-related parameter. Acoustic volume measurement technology is the subject of U.S. Patents Nos. 5,575,310 and 5,755,683 assigned to DEKA Products Limited Partnership, as well as the co-pending provisional U.S. patent application entitled "METHOD OF VOLUME MEASUREMENT FOR FLOW CONTROL", Serial No. 60/789,243, filed April 5,2006, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.   Fluid volume sensing in the nanoliter range is possible with this embodiment, thus contributing to highly accurate and precise monitoring and delivery. Other alternate techniques for measuring fluid flow may also be used; for example, Doppler-based methods; the use of Hall-effect sensors in combination with a vane or flapper valve; the use of a strain beam (for example, related to a flexible member over a fluid chamber to sense deflection of the flexible member); the use of capacitive sensing with plates; or thermal time of flight methods.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6 through 9, embodiments are shown in which a sensor utilizes acoustic volume sensing (AVS) technology. A first discussion refers to embodiments depicted in FIGS. 6 and 7. The dispensing assembly 120 has a sensor that includes a reference chamber 127, and a variable volume measurement chamber 121 that is coupled by a port 128 to a fixed-volume chamber 129. While the invention may be practiced with a reference chamber 127, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, in certain other embodiments of the invention, no reference volume is provided. It is to be understood that volume 129 is referred to, herein, as "fixed" as a matter of terminology, but that the actual volume may vary slightly, on the time scale of acoustic excitation, as when the region referred to as fixed volume 129 is driven by a speaker diaphragm. Fluid flows from the pumping assembly 16 to an input 123, through the resilient dispensing chamber 122, and out of an exit channel 124. Due to the high downstream impedance, as fluid enters the dispensing chamber 122, the dispensing diaphragm 125 expands into the variable volume chamber 121. An electronics assembly, which may be arranged on a printed circuit board 126, has a loudspeaker 1202, a sensing microphone 1203, and a reference microphone 1201 for measuring acoustic parameters associated with a gas (typically air) in the variable volume chamber 121, the volume of which is defined by the position of the dispending diaphragm 125. Sound waves<br>
 <br>
induced by the loudspeaker 134 travel through the fixed volume chamber 129 to the variable volume chamber 121 via the port 128; sound waves also travel to the reference chamber 127. As the dispensing diaphragm 125 moves with the flow of fluid through the flow line, the volume of air in the variable volume chamber 121 varies, causing related changes in its acoustic characteristics, which may be detected by the loudspeaker and microphone 1203. For the same acoustic stimulations, the reference microphone 1201 may detect acoustic characteristics of the fixed reference volume 127. These reference measurements may, for example, be used to factor out imprecision and to reject common-mode inaccuracies in acoustic stimulation, and other errors. The volume of fluid displaced may be determined by comparing the measured volume of the variable volume chamber 121 to an initial volume of the variable volume chamber 121. Since the total combined volume of the dispensing chamber 122 and variable volume chamber 121 stays constant, the absolute volume of the dispensing chamber 122 can also be estimated.<br>
The embodiment shown in FIG. 6 utilizes an inherently resilient dispensing diaphragm 125, while the embodiment shown in FIG. 7 utilizes a resilient dispensing spring 130, which when combined with a dispensing diaphragm 125, increases the resiliency of the dispensing chamber 122 and may allow the use of a more compliant (i.e., less resilient) dispensing diaphragm 125 than would be required in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5. The dispensing spring 130 is typically positioned adjacent to the dispensing diaphragm 125 on a side of the diaphragm 125 opposite to the dispensing chamber 122.<br>
Alternately, to reduce background noise from the microphone, the loudspeaker 1202 and the sensing microphone 1203 may be coupled to the variable volume chamber 121 via separate ports.    As schematically shown in FIG. 8, a loudspeaker 1202 generates pressure waves in a fixed loudspeaker volume 6000 which is acoustically coupled with the variable volume chamber 121 via a loudspeaker port 6020. Pressure waves travel from the loudspeaker 1202, through the loudspeaker port 6020 to the variable volume chamber 121 and then through a microphone port 6010 before being recorded by the sensing microphone 1203. The loudspeaker port 6020 may include a tube portion 6040 with a flared aperture<br>
 <br>
6030. The flared aperture 6030 serves to create a uniform length along which sound waves travel for all axial paths of the tube portion 6040. For example, the tube portion 6040 can have the geometry of a cylinder, such as a right cylinder or right circular cylinder. A similarly flared aperture may also adjoin a tube portion to define the microphone port 6010. In contrast to the AVS sensor of FIGS. 6 and 7, in the embodiment of FIG. 8, pressure waves traveling from the loudspeaker 1202 do not have a direct path to the sensing microphone 1203. Thus, pressure waves from the loudspeaker 1202 are prevented from directly impacting the sensing microphone 1203 without first passing through the variable volume 121. A lower background signal is therefore received by the microphone and a better signal/noise ratio is achieved. Additionally, an upper shelf 6050 may be included in any of the embodiments of FIGS. 6-8 advantageously reducing the volume of the reference chamber 127.<br>
In embodiments to be further described, it may be convenient to separate the sensor and metering chamber portions of the dispensing assembly such that the dispensing chamber is detachable and disposable. In this case, the dispensing chamber resides in a disposable section of the patch, while the sensor resides in the reusable section. The dispensing chamber may be bounded by a resilient fluid dispensing diaphragm (as shown in FIG. 6 as 122 and 124). Alternately, as in FIG. 7, the dispensing chamber 122 may be bounded by a compliant diaphragm 125. In this case, a dispensing spring 130 can be used to impart resiliency on the dispensing chamber 122. When the sensor 550 and dispensing chamber 122 are brought together, the dispensing spring 130 covers the compliant dispensing diaphragm 125. The dispensing spring 130 and dispensing diaphragm 125 may alternately be employed as a single part defining the dispensing chamber 122.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, an alternate embodiment of the dispensing assembly is shown. In an embodiment of dispensing assembly 120 depicted in FIG. 9, variable-volume measurement chamber 121 shares a compliant wall (here shown as compliant diaphragm 125) with dispensing chamber 122. Port 128 acoustically couples measurement chamber 121 to fixed volume chamber 129, so as to form an acoustically contiguous region designated generally by numeral 1290. A compressible fluid (typically, air, or another gas) fills the acoustically contiguous<br>
 <br>
region 1290 and is excited by a driving member 1214, itself driven by an actuator 1216. Driving member 1214 may be a diaphragm of a speaker, such as a hearing aid speaker, where actuator 1216 is a voice coil solenoid or piezoelectric element, for example. Within the scope of the invention, driving member 1214 may also be coextensive with actuator 1216, such as where driving member 1214 may, itself, be a piezoelectric element. Driving member 1214 may be contained within a driver module 1212 that may contain, on a side of driving member 1214 distal to fixed volume 129, a reference volume 1220. However, reference volume 1220 is typically not employed in practice of the invention.<br>
A reference microphone 1208 is shown in acoustic communication with fixed volume 129, while a signal microphone 1209 is acoustically coupled to measurement chamber 121. The volume of measurement region 121 may be determined from electronic signals provided by one or more microphones 1208, 1209 on the basis of pressure variations (or, equivalently, acoustic signal) measured at their respective positions within the acoustically contiguous region 1290. Phase measurements may be performed by comparing the phase of response at one or more microphones relative to the phase of acoustic excitation or relative to the phase of response at a position of another microphone. The volume of measurement region 121, and, by implication, of dispensing chamber 122, is determined, on the basis of phase and/or amplitude measurements, as discussed below, by a processor 1210, which derives power from power source 1211, shown, representatively, as a battery.<br>
For the purposes of precise delivery of minute amounts of therapeutic agents, the delivery of small, but very accurately metered, quantities per pump stroke is desirable. However, if minute volumes of fluid are to be pumped through line 110 during the course of each pump stroke, extremely high resolution is required of the metering process. Consequently, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, changes in volume are measured by sensor 550 with a resolution of at least 10 nanoliters. Measurements of resolution 0.01% of the empty volume of measurement region 121 may be achieved in some embodiments of the invention.   In accordance with other embodiments of the invention, sensor 550 provides resolution of better than 13 nanoliters. In other embodiments yet,<br>
 <br>
sensor 550 provides resolution of better than 15 nanoliters, and in yet further embodiments, resolution of better than 20 nanoliters is provided. In such cases, the total volume of acoustically contiguous region 1290 may be less than 130 jil, and, in other embodiments, less than 10 p.1.<br>
In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, use may be made of a priori modeling of the response of the volume of dispensing chamber 122, and, consequently of variable-volume chamber 121 (which may also be referred to, herein, as a "metering volume"), based upon the filling of the dispensing chamber due to a pumped volume of fluid entering through input 123. While other models are within the scope of the present invention, one model that may be employed expresses the volume of fluid within dispensing chamber 122, in response to a pumped influx of fluid and a outlet of fixed flow impedance, as the sum of a baseline volume YB and an exponentially decaying volume characterized by a peak displacement VD, such that the metering chamber volume during a measurement is characterized as a function of time t, as:<br>
 <br>
In order to fit a parameterization of the modeled exponential decay (or other functional model) to a succession of acoustic measurements, the response of systems such as depicted in FIGS. 6 through 9 is developed as follows. For purposes of modeling the response, port 128 is characterized by a length 1 and a diameter d. The pressure and volume of an ideal adiabatic gas can be related by PV —K, where K is a constant defined by the initial conditions of the system.<br>
The ideal adiabatic gas law can be written in terms of a mean pressure, P, and volume, V, and a small time-dependent perturbation on top of those pressures,<br>

<br>
 <br>
The intervals over which each successive temporal sample is obtained, and the<br>
number of intervals sampled in order to fit the parameters of the temporal model<br>
are advantageously optimized for each specific application of the invention.<br>
Where fluid flows at a slow but relatively constant rate, as in basal insulin<br>
delivery, sampling over a period from T/3 to 3x has been found efficacious. On the<br>
other extreme, where a relatively large bolus of fluid is to be delivered, the fluid<br>
may reside in dispensing volume 122 for only a short period of time, on the time<br>
scale of the exponential decay time constant. In that case, sampling is performed<br>
over a shorter fraction of the characteristic decay time.	. .<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, volume of fluid dispensed through dispensing volume 122 is determined on the basis of a fit to a model of volume vs. time, based on cross-system phase measurements made at monotonic frequency of excitation. During the initial portion of a pump stroke, moreover, preliminary measurements are made in order to calibrate system operation, as now described, in conjunction with the measurement protocol, with<br>
 <br>
reierence to me tiowcnart snown in t'LG. 117. The metering process, denoted generally by numeral 1170, advantageously conserves computer resources and minimizes power consumption, thereby extending the useful time between charges or replacement of power source 1211 (shown in FIG. 9), while providing, through frequent calibration, the measurement accuracy required for delivery of fluid with the resolution per stroke described above.<br>
Either prior to, or at the beginning 1171 of, each pump stroke, or both, processor 1210 initiates a Self-Calibration Phase 1172 of the AVS system. Measurements are held-off until electronic transients due to activation of the pump have substantially decayed. Microphone and speaker gains are set, and driving member 1214 is actuated, in step 1173, at a succession of frequencies, where typically five frequencies are employed, in the general proximity of the resonance of contiguous acoustic region 1290 (otherwise referred to herein as the "acoustic chamber"). Frequencies in the range of 6-8 kHz are typically employed, though the use of any frequencies is within the scope of the present invention. At the onset of activation of each successive frequency, data collection is delayed, for a period of approximately 5 ms, until acoustic transients have substantially decayed.<br>
For a duration of approximately 64 acoustic cycles, data are collected as follows: the temperature reading provided by temperature sensor 132 (shown in FIG. 70B) is sampled in step 1174, and the real and imaginary portions of the ratio of output signals of signal microphone 1209 with respect to reference microphone 1208, denoted p and t, respectively, are sampled. The complex ratio of signals, or other functional combination of the microphone signals with respect to the reference, may be referred to herein as the "signal," for purposes of describing the AVS system.<br>
On the basis of measurements at each frequency, taken over the course of approximately 200 ms per frequency, a set of means and variances are derived for each of the real and imaginary parts of the signal at each frequency and for the temperature readings. Analysis, in step 1175, of these values, permits a determination of whether errors are within specified bounds. An anomalous<br>
 <br>
transfer function may advantageously indicate system faults that include, but are not limited to, faults in the microphones or other sensors, speaker, transducer, electronics, mechanical components, fluid ingress, poor acoustic seal, excessive ambient noise, and excessive shock and vibration. Additionally, the functional dependence of the phase angle of the signal as a function of frequency is determined in step 1176. The phase angle of the signal, namely the arctangent of the ratio of imaginary to real portions thereof, may be used as a measure of phase, however any measure of phase may be used within the scope of the invention. The functional dependence may be derived by polynomial fit of the phase to the frequency, or otherwise. On the basis of the polynomial fit, or otherwise, the slope of phase vs. frequency is determined at the volume measurement frequency, and volume measurement proceeds, in step 1177. Additionally, and significantly, an anomalous slope of phase vs. frequency is indicative of a gaseous bubble in the fluid contained within dispensing chamber 122.<br>
For a succeeding portion of each pump stroke, driving member 1214 is actuated at substantially a single frequency, thereby acoustically exciting the gas within acoustically contiguous region 1290 at that frequency. Signal data, based typically on the complex ratio of output signals of signal microphone 1209 with respect to reference microphone 1208 are collected and averaged over specified sampling intervals of approximately 64 cycles. Real and imaginary components of the signal, as well as temperature data, are recorded for each sampling interval. Based on the sampled and collected data, a fit is performed to a temporal model. In various embodiments of the invention, a gradient-descent method is employed, as described above, in order to minimize error in fitting the model parameters, namely the baseline volume VB, peak displacement VD, and decay time x, of the variable volume chamber 121 during the course of each pump stroke, thereby providing the volume of fluid delivered through dispensing chamber 122.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, the dispensing spring 130 may have a spiral or fan shape that is complementary to the diaphragm and may have multiple helical grooves 131. Embodiments of the spring as shown can apply an approximately even force over the d*   ' iragm. This approximately even force helps the<br>
 <br>
diaphragm to retain an approximately concave shape as it expands. The grooves 131 allow air to pass freely through the spring, thus most air is not trapped between the spring and the diaphragm.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 11A and 1 IB, examples of kinetic measurements of the volume of the dispensing chamber 122 (shown in FIG. 5) and of the calculated cumulative volume expelled from the dispensing chamber 122 are shown for a typical basal delivery pulse (FIG. 11 A) and for a typical bolus delivery (FIG. 1 IB). As can be seen in FIG. 11 A, actuation of the pumping assembly 16 causes an expansion of the dispensing chamber 122, as measured by the acoustic volume sensor 550, from about 0 to about 1.5 u.1 in about 2 seconds. The resilient dispensing chamber 122 is seen to contract and expel its fluid from the chamber 122 through the high impedance output over a course of about 30 seconds with an exponential decay kinetic characterized by a half-life (tj/2) of about 6 seconds. The cumulative volume of output from dispensing chamber 122 is calculated from the measurements made by the sensor 550 and seen also to rise exponentially to about 1.5 u.1. It can be seen that the high impedance output introduces a delay between actuation of the pump assembly and delivery of the majority of the displaced fluid. The ti/2 characteristic of the system can be chosen with attention to the resilient force exerted by the dispensing chamber 122 and the degree of impedance of the output. In various embodiments, the time constant may vary to save power and eliminate drift issues. The time constant may be, for example, tj/2= 2 seconds, or ti/e= 2 seconds.<br>
FIG. 1 IB shows a kinetic profile of a bolus delivery of fluid by the fluid delivery device 10. A rapid succession of about 29 pump actuations (i.e., pulses) each displace fluid from a fluid source into the resilient dispensing chamber 122, thus causing corresponding changes in the parameter measured by the acoustic volume measurement sensor 550. It can be seen that the volume of the dispensing chamber 122 expands on the first pump pulse to about 1.5 uJ, a value similar to that observed in FIG. 11A. The dispensing chamber 122 volume further expands upon additional pulsatile pumping at pulse intervals shorter than the time period required to achieve full discharge of the dispensing assembly 120; the expansion reaches a maximum of about 6 ui. Cessation of the pump pulsing occurs after<br>
 <br>
about 85 seconds and the volume of the chamber 122 is seen to decrease with an exponential decay kinetic resulting in complete discharge of its contents by about 30 seconds after cessation of pumping. The Ua for this final discharge is approximately the same as for the basal delivery shown in FIG. 11A. The calculated cumulative output volume is seen to rise during pumping with an approximately linear kinetic and plateau upon cessation of pumping.<br>
In the described system, fault conditions are detected by volume measurements rather than by pressure measurements, thus, faults may be determined in seconds. FIGS. 11C-1 IF illustrate the sensor 550 of FIGS. 5-7 detection various types of fault conditions.   All description with respect to FIGS. 11C-11F are described with reference to FIGS. 5-7.<br>
FIG. 11C shows a kinetic profile of sensor 550 output over time for a pumping pulse under normal operating conditions. In contrast, Fig 1 ID shows an expected result of an occlusion downstream of the dispensing assembly 120; the increasing (or not decreasing) volume of fluid in the dispensing chamber 122 is quickly detected by the sensor 550.<br>
Low volume conditions are shown in FIGS. 11E-1 IF. In FIG. 1 IE, an approximate maximum sensor signal is reached, followed by an overly fast decay; this condition may indicate an internal leak in the pump 16, line 310, or dispensing assembly 120. The kinetic profile of FIG. 11F has a low peak volume signal and may be representative of a pump failure, an empty reservoir 20, or an occlusion that is upstream of the dispensing chamber 122. Delayed expansion of the dispensing chamber 122 in response to pump actuation may also indicate a problem in the flow line 310. The sensor 550 may also be capable of detecting bubbles in the fluid. An alarm can be activated in response to detection of a fault condition.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a flow chart depicting a cycle of acoustic volume sensing and compensation (corresponding to control loop 360 of FIGS. 2A-3). The sensor may measure the amount of fluid dispensed from the device 10 based on measures<br>
 <br>
of the magnitude of the cyclical changes in the variable volume chamber 121 induced by the pumping cycles. For example, the sensor 550 may repeatedly acquire acoustic spectra of the resonant variable volume 121 and the reference volume chamber 127 (step 2611) and maintains a parameter, which, for each pumping pulse, is updated to incorporate the decrease in volume of gas in the variable volume chamber 121. Accordingly the updated parameter indicates the net quantity of fluid that has entered the dispensing chamber 122. The fluid entering the dispensing chamber 122 is approximately equal to the volume that has been dispensed by the device 10 if there is sufficient delay between pulses. Alternately, the sensor 550 can repeatedly measure the increase in the volume of gas in the variable volume chamber 121 to determine the amount dispensed by the device (if there is a sufficient delay between pulses). Acoustic spectra are compared to model spectra in a lookup table that may correspond to any or all of a dispensing chamber 122 with a bubble, without a bubble, or with bubbles of varying sizes (step 2621). The lookup table may hold data acquired experimentally, determined using a model, or determined to work empirically. The lookup table may contain data representing varying bubble containing and/or normal conditions for multiple degrees of expansion of dispensing chamber 122. If the spectrum and updated sum fit a model of normal flow (step 2631), another acoustic spectrum is acquired and the cycle is repeated at step 2611. If the spectrum and/or the updated sum do not fit a model of normal flow, the presence of a low or occluded flow will be determined (step 2641).   A low or occluded flow may be indicated by a persistently out-of-range volume of the variable volume chamber 121, by an updated sum that is lower than a predicted or set value, or both.   If a low or occluded flow condition is detected, an alarm will be triggered (step 2671). Alarms may include audible signals, vibrations, or both. If no condition of low or occluded flow is found, the device determines if the spectrum fits a model corresponding to a condition of a bubble in the dispensing chamber 122 (step 2661). If a bubble is determined to be present, a reaction is initiated that may include an alarm and/or compensatory action which may include temporarily increasing the rate of pumping (step 2651) and the cycle will begin again at step 2611. If it is determined that no bubble is present, an alarm is triggered to indicate an undetermined fault condition (step 2671). Embodiments of the present invention may also utilize bubble detection using AVS technology<br>

The pumping assembly 16 of FIGS. 2A -3 urges fluid from the reservoir 20 to the dispensing assembly 120. When a dispensing assembly according to FIGS. 6-7 is used, it is not necessary to use a high precision pump, because the feedback provided from the dispensing assembly 120 to the pumping assembly 16 allows adjustment of the pumping assembly 16 based on exact measurements of the volume being delivered. The individual pumping pulses may be of sufficiently low volume to allow precise compensation based on the feedback. Many different pumping assembly 16 implementations can therefore be employed. Various possible embodiments of the pumping assembly 16 are described below.<br>
FIGS. 13 and 14 schematically show alternate embodiments of some of the components in a fluid delivery device according to an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 13 shows a flow line 310 with a pumping assembly 16 having a pumping element 2100 located between an upstream one way valve 21 and a downstream one way valve 22. The pumping element 2100 may use an actuator to deform a portion of the flow line to generate pressure in the flow line 310. The upstream one way valve 21 inhibits retrograde flow from the pumping element 2100 toward a fluid source (not shown), while the downstream one way valve 22 inhibits retrograde flow from the volume-sensing chamber 120 to the pumping element 2100. As a result, fluid is driven in the direction of the exit assembly 17, which, in one embodiment, includes a high-impedance passage.<br>
In an alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 14, the functions of the pumping element, i.e., generating pressure in the flow line 310, and the upstream one way valve 21 are performed by a combined valving pump 2200. Thus, the pumping assembly 16 in the FIG. 14 embodiment is made up of two components—the combined valving pump 2200 and the downstream one way valve 22—instead of the three components used in the FIG. 13 embodiment. Other embodiments of the pumping assembly 16 may be used. The combination of valving and pumping functions in valving pump 2200 may be accomplished by a variety of<br>
 <br>
mechanisms, some of which are described below with reference to FIGS. 15A-16 and 22-56.<br>
In many of the embodiments described below, the poppet for the inlet valve 21, the poppet for the exit valve 22 and the pumping actuation member 54 are all either directly or indirectly (e.g., as in FIGS. 50-56) in communication with the fluid line 310 such that each of these elements are able to create or react to various fluid pressures. As noted above, the upstream and downstream valves—which may also be referred to herein as the inlet and exit valves—are one way valves. The valves can be volcano, flapper, check or duck-bill valves, amongst other types of one way valves, or other types of valves that bias the flow toward the device output. An example of volcano valves are disclosed in U.S. application No. 5,178,182 issued January 12, 1993 to Dean L. Kamen, and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 15A-15D, the pumping assembly includes both an inlet valve 21 and an exit valve 22, each of which includes a fluid inlet, a fluid exit, and a moveable member (which is, for each valve, a portion of membrane 2356). The pumping assembly also includes a pumping element 2100. The pumping element is located downstream from the inlet valve 21 and upstream from the exit valve 22. In the following description, the exit valve will be starting from the closed position, i.e., fluid is not flowing through the exit valve. However, at a time when the fluid presents enough pressure, the fluid pressure opens the exit valve by placing pressure on the membrane and the exit valve's poppet 9221 to open the valve, and the fluid can then flow through the exit valve 22. The embodiment of FIGS. 15 A through 15D may be considered to be a combined valving-pump (like item 2200 in Fig. 14), in the sense that a single mechanical action both occludes a pump inlet and then urges flow through a pump outlet. <br>
This pumping arrangement has the advantage of partitioning the moving parts and wetted line components to opposite sides of a flexible barrier membrane 2356. As<br>
 <br>
a result, the moving parts may be located in a reusable component and the wetted parts (fluidic line 310) may be located in a disposable component.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the pumping mechanism, the fluid source is a non-pressurized reservoir. When the moveable member of the inlet valve is in the open position, and a negative pressure exists in the pumping chamber, a pressure differential exists that pulls the fluid from the reservoir towards the inlet valve. This negative pressure may be created by the resiliency of the membrane in the pumping chamber. In one alternative embodiment, a spring—which may be built into the membrane—may be used to assist in the recoil of the membrane in the pumping chamber. The non-pressurized reservoir may be collapsible, so that when fluid is drawn from it, a corresponding collapse in the reservoir reduces its volume. As a result, build-up of negative pressure, or air in the reservoir is prevented.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the pumping mechanism, after the inlet valve is closed, pressure is applied to the pumping chamber forcing fluid from the pumping chamber towards the exit valve. Pressure created by the pumping motion opens the exit valve and allows fluid to flow through the exit valve's fluid exit.<br>
The moveable member can be anything capable of functioning as described above. In some embodiments, the moveable member is a flexible membrane or a resilient pumping diaphragm. In other embodiments, the moveable member is a ball-shaped rigid structure or another object capable of preventing fluid from flowing out of an opening in the fluid path.<br>
In practice, the pumping mechanism may be primed prior to use. Thus, the pumping mechanism cycles through a number of strokes, purging air from the fluid line, until most or all of the air in the fluid line is purged. Many of the pumping mechanisms disclosed herein have the ability to "self-prime" because the fluid volume contained outside the pumping chamber, but between the valves, is small. When the pump squeezes air in the pump chamber, it generally builds up enough pressure to blow past the exit valve. The subsequent return stroke can<br>
 <br>
therefore develop sufficient negative pressure for the pump to pull liquid from the reservoir. If the "dead" volume of the pump is too large, the air in the pumping chamber may not build up enough pressure to escape the exit valve. As a result, the pump may stall.<br>
FIGS. 15A-15D, 16 and 22-56 show several embodiments of the pumping mechanism. Referring now to FIGS. 15A-15D, one embodiment of the pumping mechanism is shown exemplifying several steps in the pumping process: 1. fluid passing through the inlet valve 21 (as shown in Fig. 15B); 2. the inlet valve closed (as shown in FIG. 15C); and 3. the pumping actuation member 54 forcing fluid downstream, with fluid pressure opening the exit valve 22 and flowing through the fluid exit (as shown in FIG. 15D).<br>
The pumping mechanism of FIGS. 15A-15D includes a moveable member, which, in this embodiment, is a portion of the flexible membrane 2356. The inlet and exit valves include poppets 9221, 9222 that function as valve occluders. Each of the poppets 9221, 9222 and the pump actuation member 54 include a spring 8002, 8004, 8006. The pump plate 8000 is attached to both the pump actuation member 54 and the inlet poppet 9221 and serves as a terminus to their respective springs 8004, 8002.<br>
The term "poppet" is used to denote a member that applies pressure against the moveable member (i.e., the membrane) to affect the position of the membrane. Although other designs may be used, some specific examples of spring-loaded poppet valves that utilize structures and principles of mechanical advantage are described below (in connection with FIGS. 50-56). . However, mechanisms other than poppets can be used to perform the same function. In FIGS. 15B-15D, the inlet valve 21 includes a fluid inlet and fluid exit, part of the membrane 2356, and a poppet 9221. The exit valve 22 includes a fluid inlet a fluid exit, part of the membrane and a poppet 9222.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 15A-15D, the fluid path 310 is defined by a structure (item 9310 in FIG. 15A), which may be rigid or have some flexibility (preferably less flexibility than membrane 2356. As shown in FIG. 15A, the<br>
 <br>
housing structure 9310 defines the valving chambers 9321,9322 and the pumping chamber 2350; all three of these chambers are in the fluid path 310.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 15B-15D, the inlet valve 21, exit valve 22 and pump element 2100 each have a fluid inlet and a fluid exit. The pumping actuation member 54 has a pumping chamber 2350 where the fluid flows after exiting the inlet valve. Pumping actuation member 54 applies pressure onto the membrane 2356, creating positive pressure in the fluid line.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 15B-15D (and similarly for the valve seat 4070 for the outlet valve shown in FIGS. 50-56), the valve seat 9121 in the inlet valve 21 is preferably spaced away from the membrane 2356, when the membrane is not being actuated by the poppet 9221 of the inlet valve.<br>
The fluid line 310 is partially defined by a membrane 2356. In this embodiment, the membrane 2356 separates parts of the pumping mechanism from the fluid. Thus, the fluid line 310 is wetted and the pumping actuator 54 and the valve poppets 9221, 9222 are not wetted. However, alternative embodiments of the pumping assembly do not need to include a membrane 2356 that is in contact with the fluid line 310. Instead, a different moveable member may be used for the valves and/or pump. In still other embodiments, only parts of the fluid line 310 are separated from the pumping mechanism, thus partially wetting the pumping assembly.<br>
The inlet poppet 9221 includes an end 8018 referring to the surface area of the inlet poppet that contacts the membrane portion of the fluid line 310. The pumping actuation member 54 includes an end 8012 that contacts the membrane portion of the fluid line 310. Likewise, the exit poppet 22 includes an end 8022 that contacts the membrane portion of the fluid line 310. The ends 8018,8022 of the valve poppets apply pressure onto their respective areas of the membrane 2356, blocking or unblocking the respective portions of the flow path 310. The end 8012 of the pressure actuation member also applies pressure onto its respective area of the membrane, so as to cause flow through the fluid line 310.<br>
 <br>
The pumping actuation member 54 is surrounded by a pliihger biasing spring 8004. The plunger biasing spring 8004 has both a terminus at the pump plate 8000 and at 8014, a support structure that also holds the pumping actuation member.<br>
The inlet poppet 21 is surrounded by an inlet poppet spring 8002, although in alternate embodiments, the inlet poppet itself is resilient and so serves the function of the spring. The inlet poppet spring 8002 has both a terminus at the pump plate 8000 and near the end 8018 of the inlet poppet 9221.<br>
The exit poppet 9222 is surrounded by a passive exit poppet spring 8006. The exit poppet spring 8006 has both a terminus at an exit poppet plate 8024 and the lip 8020 near the end of the exit poppet 9222.<br>
In each case, the springs 8002, 8004, 8006 terminate before the respective ends and do not interfere with the surface areas 8018, 8012, 8022 that contact the membrane 23S6.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the fluid pumping device also includes at least one shape memory actuator 278 (e.g., a conductive shape-memory alloy wire) that changes shape with temperature. The temperature of the shape-memory actuator(s) may be changed with a heater, or more conveniently, by application of an electric current. FIGS. 15B-15D show an embodiment with one shape memory actuator 278, however, in other embodiments (described below) there may be more than one shape memory actuator 278. In one embodiment, the shape memory actuator is a shape memory wire constructed of nickel/titanium alloy, such as NITINOL™ or FLEXINOL®. However, in other embodiments, any device capable of generating a force, such as a solenoid, could also be used. In certain embodiments, the shape memory actuator 278 has a diameter of about 0.003 inches and is about 1.5 inches in length. However, in other embodiments, the shape memory actuator 278 may be made from any alloy capable of contraction with heat (and expansion may be aided by a mechanism that imparts force on the alloy so as to stretch the alloy to the original length, i.e., a spring, although such a mechanism is not reauiredl so as to actuate the pumping<br>
 <br>
mechanism as described in the embodiments herein. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the shape memory actuator 278 can be from 0.001 inches to any diameter desired and the length can be any length desired. Generally speaking, the larger the diameter, the higher the available contraction force. However, the electrical current required to heat the wire generally increases with diameter. Thus, the diameter, length and composition of the shape memory alloy 278 may affect the current necessary to actuate the pumping mechanism. Irrespective of the length of the shape memory actuator 278, the actuation force is approximately constant. Increase in actuation force can be imparted by increasing the diameter of the shape memory actuator 278.<br>
The shape memory actuator 278 connects to the pump plate 8000 through connector 8008. Connector 8008 is described in more detail below. The shape memory actuator 278 connects to a fluid pumping device by way of terminus connector 8010. Depending on the device or system in which the pumping mechanism is used, the terminus connection location will vary. The terminus connector 8010 is described in more detail below.<br>
FIGS. 15B-15D show the pumping mechanism and fluid line 310 having already been primed as discussed above. Referring now to FIG. 15B, the inlet valve 21 is open, and the pumping actuation member 54 is not pressing against the membrane 2356. The exit valve 22 is in the closed position. The shape memory actuator 278 is in an expanded position. In this configuration, fluid is pulled from a reservoir (not shown) to the inlet valve 21 fluid inlet. (Although shown as a bulge in the membrane in the inlet valve region, the pulling of fluid in this step may cause a depression in the membrane, or no deformation of the membrane). When the inlet poppet is in the open position, the fluid can flow from the fluid inlet to the fluid exit and into the pumping chamber 2350. At this point, the exit poppet end 8022 is firmly pressed against the membrane 2356 and seals the exit valve 22.<br>
Referring next to FIG. 15C, electrical current has been applied to the shape memory actuator 278, and the shape memory actuator is contracting from a starting length towards the desired end length. The contracting of the shape memory actuator 278 pulls the pump plate 8000 towards the fluid line 310. The<br>
 <br>
inlet poppet 9221 and the pumping actuation member 54 are both connected to the pumping plate 8000. The motion of the plate 8000 pulls both the inlet poppet 9221 and pumping actuation member 54 towards the membrane 2356. As shown in FIG. 15C, the inlet poppet end 8018 is pressed firmly against the membrane 2356, sealing the membrane against the valve seat 9121 and, closing the inlet valve 21. (The motion of the inlet poppet can force a small amount of fluid in the inlet valving chamber, item 9321 in FIG. 15A, through either the fluid inlet or the fluid exit of the inlet valve 21.)<br>
Simultaneously, the pumping actuation member 54 begins its path towards the pumping chamber 2350. During this process, as the inlet poppet spring 8002 is compressed (at this point, the inlet poppet end 8018 is pressing firmly against the fluid line 310), the pump plate 8000 and pumping actuation member 54 continue traveling towards the fluid line 310. The inlet poppet spring 8002 allows the pump plate 8000 to continue moving toward the fluid line 310 with the pump actuation member 54 even when the inlet poppet 9221 can not travel any further.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 15D, the pumping actuation member 54 presses against the area of the membrane 2356 over the pumping chamber 2350 and the fluid is pumped so as to increase the pressure of the fluid in the pumping chamber 2350. Theexit poppet end 8022 remains pressing firmly (aided by the exit poppet spring 8006) on the membrane 2356 sealing the fluid inlet and fluid exit of the exit valve 22 until the pressure from the fluid flowing from the pumping chamber 2350 forces exit valve 22 open. Upon reaching a sufficient pressure, the fluid exits through the fluid exit of the exit valve 22, thus overcoming the pressure exerted against the membrane 2356 by the exit valve 22. Upon cessation of flow, the exit valve 22 is forced closed by the passive spring 8006.<br>
During the work stroke, the pump actuation member spring 8004 is loaded. Eventually, the pump actuation member spring 8004 will pull the pump actuation member 54 away from the membrane 2356. As a result, during the relaxation stroke, the spring 8004 returns the pump actuation member 54, and pumping plate 8000 to the relaxed position of FIG. 15C; the loaded inlet poppet spring 8002 may<br>
 <br>
also contribute energy to the return stroke. As the pumping plate 8000 nears its relaxed position, it engages a cap of the inlet poppet 9221 to lift and unseat the inlet poppet so as to open the inlet valve 21. The pump actuation member spring 8004 also unloads during the return stroke.'<br>
The pump plate 8000, reaching a threshold distance where the inlet poppet spring 8002 is at the same level as the pump plate 8000, will unload with the pump actuation member spring 8004. The membrane 2356 in the pumping chamber 2350, being resilient, will return to its starting position. This creates a negative pressure and as the inlet valve opens, fluid will flow through the inlet valve's fluid inlet to the fluid exit and towards the pumping chamber 2350. Thus, the pumping mechanism will now be in the state as shown in FIG. 15B.<br>
The entire pump sequence described with respect to FIGS. 15B-15D will repeat each time the pump is actuated through application of current onto the shape memory actuator 278.<br>
The membranes referred to herein, including membrane 2356, may be made from any resilient material capable of imparting the necessary characteristics to function as described herein. Additionally, the membrane material may include a biocompatible material so as not to impede operation of the pump or diminish the therapeutic value of the fluid. Multiple biocompatible resilient materials may be suitable, including nitrile and silicone. However, different therapeutic fluid compositions may require different choices of resilient material.<br>
The pumping mechanism described above and also various embodiments as described herein can be described in terms of stroke length. One way to determine stroke length is by the total change in the length of the shape memory actuator during one cycle of contraction and expansion of the shape memory actuator. This difference will determine the total distance the pump rod travels and thus, the total amount of fluid that flows out of the inlet chamber 2354 to the pumping chamber 2350, to the exit chamber 2352 and finally, out the exit chamber 2352. Another way to determine stroke length is the travel distance of the pump plate 8000. For a partial stroke, the pump plate 8000 will not reach its<br>
 <br>
maximum travel distance. In one embodiment, very small or micro-strokes are initiated continuously, pumping micro-liter volumes of fluid on a continuous or regular basis, from the reservoir to the exit. For example, a micro-stroke may displace less than 20%, 10% or 1% of the volume of the pumping chamber 2350.<br>
FIG. 16 shows a variation of the pumping mechanism embodiment shown in FIG. 15B. In FIG. 16, two different shape memory actuators—a longer one and a shorter one—are used. FIG. 16 shows an embodiment of the pumping mechanism shown in FIG. 15B in which the shape memory wire 278 is tensioned around a pulley 286 and splits into longer and shorter strands. A common juncture serving as a negative terminal may be located where the longer and shorter strands split off. Completion of a circuit with either or both of the alternate paths allows adjustment of the pumping force and/or stroke length. In an alternative embodiment, a piece of material, such as Kevlar material, extends from the common junction around the pulley to the force plate 8000, while two separate pieces of shape memory wire extend from the common junction to their respective supports. These embodiments provide both a pumping mode and an air purging mode, as described below, by using two wires with different lengths.<br>
With respect to varying stroke using the shape memory actuator variables, for a given length of shape memory actuator, the stroke is dependent on a number of variables: 1. total time electricity/heat is applied; 2. total voltage of the electricity; and 3. the diameter of the shape memory actuator. Some variable embodiments are shown in FIGS. 17-19. However, in some embodiments, the stroke can be varied while maintaining the length, electricity time and voltage. These embodiments include multiple shape memory actuators (see FIG. 19) and multiple switches on a single shape memory wire (see FIG. 17). As discussed above, the desired stroke length can also be attained by modifying any one or more of the variables.<br>
Additionally, the timing of the application of heat or electric current to the shape memory actuation can vary to control the stroke. Each time the shape memory actuator is heated can be termed a pulse. Factors such as the pulse frequency,<br>
 <br>
pulse duration, and stroke length may affect the amount of fluid delivered over time.<br>
FIGS. 17-19 additionally depict embodiments of pumping assemblies which have both a fluid pumping mode and an air purging mode. When activated, the air purging mode applies a compression stroke of increased displacement and/or increased application of force by a force application member. The air purging mode may be activated based on the likelihood or knowledge of air being present in the pumping assembly. For example, the air purging mode may be activated when the line is attached to a reservoir, when a bubble is detected by a sensor or sensing apparatus, or when insufficient flow is detected by a sensor or sensing apparatus.   Alternately, the two modes may be used to select between displacing a smaller and a larger volume of fluid for a given pumping pulse.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 17, a schematic shows a pumping assembly actuated by a shape memory actuator 278 and having multiple modes of operation. When a pumping chamber 2350 is filled with fluid, the pumping assembly operates in a fluid pumping mode. During fluid pumping mode, electrical current flows between a negative electrical lead 2960 and a positive electrical lead 2961, causing resistive heating of the alloy shape memory actuator 278 and a resultant phase change and power stroke. In one embodiment, during priming of the pumping mechanism or when a bubble 2950 is suspected to be in the pumping chamber 2350, the air purging mode is activated and electrical current flows along a path of extended length between a negative electrical lead 2960 and a positive electrical lead 2965; the result is a compression stroke of greater force on and displacement of force application member 2320 which should be sufficient to displace air 2950 from the pumping chamber 2350 to the pump outlet 2370. In alternate embodiments, the positive and negative leads may be reversed.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 18, a schematic shows an alternate pumping assembly having a plurality of shape memory actuators 278 having the same length. The additional actuators may be used to increase the actuating pressure on the pumping chamber 2350, for example, to remove an occlusion or air bubble in the fluid line, pumping chamber or other area of the pumping mechanism. The<br>
 <br>
additional actuators may also provide a redundancy to any pumping device.   A single shape memory actuator may be capable of imparting sufficient force to remove an air-bubble from the pumping chamber. Additionally, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 18, an additional return spring may be necessary depending on the length of the second shape memory actuator.<br>
When a reservoir is first attached to a flow line having a pumping assembly, the pumping mechanism (item 16 in FIGS. 13-14) is typically filled with air. Air can also enter the pumping mechanism during normal operation for various reasons. Since air is more compressible than fluid, application of a compression stroke of a length that is sufficient to displace a fluid may be insufficient to generate enough pressure to overcome the cracking pressure of a one way valve of the pumping mechanism if there is a substantial amount of air in the fluid line. Accordingly, the pumping mechanism may stall. However, it may be desired to force air through the line during priming or when an innocuously small amount of air is present in the pumping assembly. Thus, the embodiments shown in FIG. 18 can be used to impart additional force in this situation.<br>
FIG. 19 schematically shows an alternative pumping assembly 16 having a plurality of shape memory actuators. A first, shorter, shape memory actuator 2975 has a first electrical lead 2976 and a second electrical lead 2977. The shorter actuator 2975 is capable of generating compression strokes that are sufficient to displace fluid in the pumping chamber 2350; the shorter shape memory alloy actuator 2975 is used during normal fluid pumping mode operations. When an air purging mode is indicated, or a larger pumped fluid volume is required, a second longer shape memory alloy actuator 2970 may be used by sending a current along an actuator length disposed between a first electrical lead 2973 and a second electrical lead 2972. The longer shape memory alloy actuator 2970 may also be used as a backup actuator for fluid pumping mode operation by creating a shorter circuit which includes an electrical path between a first electrical lead 2972 and a second electrical lead 2971. The shorter shape memory actuator 2975 may also be used to vary the stroke volume to provide better control at lower fluid volume rates. The multiple mode actuators of FIGS. 17-19 are not limited to use with the pump components shown and may be employed with any of the various<br>
 <br>
embodiments of pumping mechanisms described herein including those using fluid pumping devices as described below and those employing valving pumps as described below. Thus, the desired stroke length can be initiated by applying electricity/heat to the length shape memory actuator that will provide the desired stroke length.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 20A and 20B, each shows one embodiment for attaching the shape memory actuator. These various embodiments can be used in any of the mechanisms or devices described herein which employ a shape memory actuator 278. Referring to both FIG. 20A and FIG. 20B, the shape memory actuator 278 is fed into a grommet 280. The grommet 280 is then attached to a part 284. Although only two embodiments of this mode of attachment are shown, various other modes are used in other embodiments. Other modes of attaching a grommet to a part or any fixed location can be used.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 21A and 2 IB, two exemplary embodiments of attaching the shape memory actuator 278 for use with a pumping mechanism 16 are shown. In each of these embodiments, the shape memory actuator 278 is designed to turn around a pulley 286. Referring to FIG. 21 A, the shape memory actuator 278 is attached to a piece 288, preferably made of KEVLAR material, by way of grommet 280. One end of the shape memory actuator 278 is shown attached to a part 284 by way of a set screw attachment 289. Referring now to FIG. 2 IB, one end of the shape memory actuator is shown attached to a part 284 by a grommet 280.<br>
Various embodiments of the pumping mechanism are shown in herein. The pumping mechanisms may include an inlet valve, a pumping actuation member and an exit valve. As discussed above, different types of one way valves may be used in alternative embodiments. Although the schematic shown in FIGS. 15A-15D shows one embodiment, the following figures show alternate embodiments.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 22 and FIG. 23, a side view and a cross section of a section of a pumping mechanism is shown. In this embodiment, the pumping actuation member is a pumping elongate finger 32. When force is exerted onto the finger<br>
 <br>
32, the finger 32 depresses the moveable member and reduces the internal volume of the fluid line. The section of the pumping mechanism in FIGS. 22 and 23 shows only the pumping chamber.   When combined with one way valves (items 21 and 22 of FIG. 13), application of a deforming force to moveable member 23 urges fluid to flow toward an exit assembly (not shown).   As shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, the finger 32 is pointed for focusing of force, but in other embodiments, the finger 32 may be flat, or of any other suitable shape. A spring 31 serves to bias the finger 32 toward a retracted position with respect to the resilient member 23 so that the finger 32 returns to the retracted, non depressing position in the absence of application of force. As shown in FIG. 23, a motor can be used to apply force onto the finger 23. However, in other embodiments, a shape memory actuator is used. Various types of motors will be suitable including electric motors and piezoelectric motors.<br>
Referring to both FIGS. 22 and 23, a backstop 33 limits the potential travel of the finger 32, supports the moveable member 23, and ensures a reduction of volume in the fluid line or pumping chamber by preventing the moveable member 23 from moving out of position in response to application of force by the finger 32. As seen in FIG. 22, the backstop 33 may advantageously have a shape complementary to the resilient member 23. In various embodiments, the pumping assembly 16 may include a lever or crank driven on one end by a motor, compressing the resilient member 23 at another end.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 24, another embodiment of the pumping actuation member is shown in relation to one section of the pumping assembly. A motor or shape memory actuator (not shown) applies a rotating force to a grouping of coupled projections 42. These projects 42 serve as the pumping actuation member and, in turn, apply force to the moveable member 23 in turn. Accordingly, intermittent pulses of force are applied to the moveable member 23. The backstop 33, as shown, can travel within a housing 44 and is upwardly biased toward the resilient member 23 by a spring 46.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 25, an embodiment of a force application assembly with a pumping actuation member (here, a plunger) 54 inside a barrel 52 is shown. A<br>
 <br>
motor causes the plunger 54 to be alternately withdrawn and inserted into the barrel. When the plunger 54 is withdrawn, a negative pressure draws fluid from the reservoir (not shown) into a channel 51 and a lumen 56. When the plunger 54 is inserted, the increased pressure in combination with the one way valves (not shown) drives fluid towards the dispensing assembly (not shown). The lumen 56 is connected to the channel 51 via a connecting channel 58 and the volume of the barrel lumen 56 decreases with the plunging action of the plunger 54 thereby urging fluid through the flow line 310.<br>
FIGS. 26 and 27 show another embodiment where the pumping actuation member is a plunger 54. A force application assembly and a linear actuator, that includes a shape memory actuation 278, drive the plunger 54.   In FIG. 26, a shape memory wire 278 is in a cool, expanded state and is attached to a first support 241 and a plunger attachment cap 244. The cap 244 is in turn attached to a biasing spring 243 which is in turn attached to a second support 242. When the wire 278 is in an expanded state, the biasing spring 243 is in a relaxed state. FIG. 27 shows the shape memory actuator 278 in a contracted state due to application of an electric current to the wire 278 and coincident heating. Upon contraction, a force is exerted on the cap 244 causing an inserting movement of a plunger 54 and a corresponding pumping action. In the contracted state, the biasing spring 243 is in a high potential energy state. Upon cessation of application of the electric field, the Nitinol wire 278 cools and expands again, allowing the biasing spring 243 to return the plunger 54 to its retracted state. As shown in FIG. 21A-21B, a shape memory actuator 278 may be wound around one or more pulleys.<br>
FIGS. 28-30 show a variety of embodiments in which pumping is accomplished by a pumping actuation member 54 using a shape memory actuator 278 to compress a moveable member forming a pumping chamber. The pumping chamber is bounded by one way valves 21, 22. FIG. 28 shows an embodiment including a pumping mechanism where the pumping actuation member is a plunger 54 in a barrel 52. The mechanism also includes a lever 273, a fulcrum 274, and a shape memory actuator 278. A shape memory actuator 278 is held within a housing 298 and is attached at one end to a conductive support 279 and at the other end to a positive terminal 275 of a lever 273. The lever 273 is in turn<br>
 <br>
attached at its center to a fulcrum 274 and at a second end to a plunger 54.   An electric current is applied to cause current to flow through the terminal 275, the shape memory actuator 278, and the conductive support 279, thereby causing the shape memory actuator 278 to contract, causing lever 273 to pivot about the fulcrum 274 and effect withdrawal of the plunger 54. Cessation of the current allows cooling of the shape memory actuator 278, allowing it to expand. The return spring 276 acts via the lever 273 to return the plunger 54 to an inserted position within the barrel 52. The return spring 276 is held in a housing 277. An o-ring 281 prevents leaking of fluid from the plunger 54-barrel 52 assembly.   The insertion and withdrawal of plunger 54 causes fluid to flow through the flow line in a direction determined by the orientation of two check valves: a first one way valve 21 and a second one way valve 22. Any suitable backflow prevention device may be used, which include one way valve, check valves, duck bill valves, flapper valves, and volcano valves.<br>
FIG. 29 shows another embodiment of a pumping mechanism having a plunger 54, a barrel 52, and a force application assembly that includes a shape memory actuator 278. However, this embodiment, unlike the embodiment shown in FIG. 28, does not include a lever. A shape memory actuator 278 is held within a housing 298 and is attached at one end to a conductive support 279 and at the other end to a plunger cap 244 by way of contact 275. The plunger cap 244 is attached to the plunger 54.   Once ample electric current is applied through a contact 275, the shape memory actuator 278 contracts. This contraction causes a pulling on the plunger cap 244 to effect insertion of the plunger 54 into the barrel 52. Cessation of the current allows cooling and of the shape memory actuator 278, thereby allowing it to expand. Upon expansion of the wire, the return spring 276 acts to return the plunger 54 to a withdrawn position within the barrel 52. The return spring 276 is held in a housing 277. O-rings 281 prevent fluid from leaking plunger 54-barrel 52 assembly.  The insertion and withdrawal of the plunger 54 causes fluid to flow through the flow line in a direction determined by the orientation of a first one way valve 21 and a second one way valve 22.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 30, an embodiment of a pumping device using a plunger 54 and a barrel 52 is shown. In this embodiment, a shape memory actuator 278 in the<br>
 <br>
form of a wire positioned in a shaft within the plunger 54 is used to impart force on the plunger. The shape memory actuator 278 extends from a plunger cap 272 through a shaft in a plunger 54 and through a channel 58 to a supporting base 299. O-rings 281 and 282 seal the plunger 54, barrel 52, and channel 58.    Application of electrical current to a first lead 258 and a second lead 257 causes heating of the shape memory actuator 278 which results in contraction of the shape memory actuator 278. Contraction of the shape memory actuator 278 causes a downward force sufficient to overcome the upward bias of a return spring 276 to be exerted on the plunger cap 272, thereby driving the plunger 54 into the lumen 290 of the barrel 52. Expansion of the shape memory actuator 278 allows the return spring 276 to return the plunger 54 to a withdrawn position. The insertion and withdrawal of plunger 54 causes fluid to flow through the flow line in a direction determined by the orientation of a first one way valve 21 and a second one way valve 22.<br>
An alternate embodiment of the pumping mechanism is shown in FIG. 31. The pumping actuation member is an assembly 101 that combines the functions of a reservoir and pumping mechanism. Under the command of a controller 501, a motor 25 drives a plunger 102 to create pressure in a reservoir 104, thereby forcing fluid through a first one way valve 106. Fluid then enters the resilient dispensing chamber 122 of a volume sensing assembly 120 with a sensor 550, and to an exit assembly 17. An optional second one way valve 107 may be included. Feedback control between the sensor 550 and the motor 25 via the controller 501 assures the desired flow of fluid to the patient. The first one way valve 106 serves to prevent reverse flow of fluid due to the resilient force of the dispensing chamber 122 of the volume sensing assembly 120 when the chamber is filled and extended. The second one way valve 107 serves to prevent reverse flow of fluid from the exit assembly 17 or patient 12 into the dispensing chamber 122. In this embodiment, the sensor 550 can immediately detect the volume in the dispensing chamber 122.<br>
FIGS. 32 - 34 schematically show sectional views of a combined valving pump 2200. FIG. 32 shows the valving pump 2200 with a collection chamber 2345 and a pumping chamber 2350 in a resting position, prior to actuation; FIG. 33 shows<br>
 <br>
the valving pump 2200 in an actuating state during a compression stoke; and FIG. 34 shows the pump in an actuated state at the end of a compression stroke. A pump inlet 2310 is in fluid communication with an upstream fluid source, such as a reservoir, and connects to a first end of a channel 2360. The channel 2360 connects at a second end to the collection chamber 2345, which is in fluid communication with a diaphragm aperture 2390 disposed in a resilient pumping diaphragm 2340. The collection chamber 2345 is bounded on a first side by the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 and on a second side by a resilient pumping membrane 2330. The pumping membrane 2330 may be made from, among other things, latex or silicone rubber. The downstream side of the diaphragm aperture 2390 opens into the pumping chamber 2350. During priming of the pump and between actuation cycles, fluid travels from a fluid source such as a reservoir, through the pump inlet 2310, the channel 2360, the collection chamber 2345, and the diaphragm aperture 2390, and then arrives in the pumping chamber 2350. A one way valve 22 prevents fluid from leaving the pumping chamber 2350 via a pump outlet 2370 until and unless ample fluid pressure is exerted against the one way valve 22 such that the one way valve 22 is open. In FIG. 32 a pumping actuation member 2320 is shown in a resting position, and the resilient pumping membrane 2330 is shown in a relaxed configuration of minimal surface area, thereby maximizing the volume of the collection chamber 2345. Although in this embodiment, the pumping actuation member is shown as a ball, in other embodiments, the pumping actuation member can be anything capable of actuation and applying ample force against the resilient pumping membrane 2330 in order to actuate the pumping mechanism.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 33, when the pumping actuation member 2320 is actuated during a compression stroke, the pumping actuation member 2320 begins to travel toward the diaphragm aperture 2390 of the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 and distends the resilient pumping membrane 2330, causing retrograde flow of fluid that has collected in the collection chamber 2345. Later in the force application stroke, as shown in FIG. 34, the pumping actuation member 2320 will sealingly lodge the resilient pumping membrane 2330 against the diaphragm aperture 2390. To aid in sealing, the pumping actuation member 2320 may have a shape that is complementary to the shape of the diaphragm aperture 2390. For<br>
 <br>
example, the pumping actuation member 2320 may be spherical or conical and the diaphragm aperture 2390 may be a cylindrical through-hole. At this stage of the force application stroke, retrograde flow from the pumping chamber 2350 will be inhibited. Continued travel of the pumping actuation member 2320 will deform the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 and increase the pressure in the pumping chamber 2350, while continuing to seal the diaphragm aperture 2390 against retrograde flow from the pumping chamber 2350. When the pressure within the pumping chamber 2350 provides ample fluid pressure against the one way valve one way valve 22, fluid will flow from the pumping chamber 23501hrough the pump outlet 2370. During the return stroke, the pumping actuation member 2320, resilient pumping membrane 2330 and resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 return to the relaxed positions shown in FIG. 32. During the return stroke, the internal pressure of pumping chamber 2350 and collection chamber 2345 will drop, which should encourage refilling of the valving pump 2200 by inducing flow of fluid from the fluid source through the pump inlet 2310 and channel 2360.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 35, a schematic sectional view of one embodiment of a resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 is shown. A diaphragm body 2515 may be constructed of a resilient material such as silicone rubber. A diaphragm spring 2510 may also be included to impart resiliency to a flexible, or already resilient, body 2515. The diaphragm spring 2510 may be embedded within the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 or disposed adjacent to the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340.  An example of one embodiment of a diaphragm spring 2510 can be seen in FIG. 36.   A combination of a diaphragm body 2515 that includes a compliant material, and a diaphragm spring 2510 that includes a resilient material may be used; the result is a pumping diaphragm 2340 that will exhibit a high degree of sealing when contacted with the resilient pumping membrane 2330 deformed by a pumping actuation member (not shown, see FIGS. 32 — 34) and also have a high degree of resiliency. A valve seat 2517 may be positioned around the diaphragm aperture 2390. The valve seat 2517 may function as a receptacle for the deformed portion of the resilient pumping membrane 2330 The force application member 2320 may deform the pumping membrane 2330, causing the membrane 2330 to deform and sealingly contact the valve seat 2517. If sufficient force is applied, the valve seat may be resiliently deformed to ensure a thorough seal against<br>
 <br>
retrograde flow of fluid. The ratio of the section height to the section width of the valve seat 2517 can generally be selected differently and matched to the circumstances of the flow.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 36, an example of a diaphragm spring 2510 for use in the pumping diaphragm 2340 of FIG. 35 is shown. An outer annulus 2520 and an inner annulus 2540 are connected by at least three resilient arms 2530. The center of the inner annulus 2540 has a spring aperture 2550, which may be aligned with the diaphragm aperture 2390 of the pumping diaphragm 2340 as shown in FIG. 35.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 37, a schematic is shown representing a sectional view of the valving pump 2200 previously shown in FIGS. 32-34 in combination with a force application assembly which includes a pumping actuation member 2320, an actuator, and a lever 273. When energized by an actuator, such as a shape memory actuator 278, the lever 273 pivots around a fulcrum 274 to initiate a compression stroke. A hammer 2630 protrudes from the lever 273. During the compression stroke, the hammer 2630 contacts a rounded pumping actuation member 2320, causing the pumping actuation member to travel within a void in a support structure 2660, and pushing the pumping actuation member 2320 against a resilient pumping membrane 2330 until the pumping actuation member 2320 is held sealingly against a diaphragm aperture 2390 located in the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340. As the lever 273 continues travel, the pumping actuation member 2320 causes deformation of a pumping diaphragm 2340.   When enough fluid pressure is exerted onto the one way valve 22, the one way valve 22 opens. This allows the fluid to flow from a pumping chamber 2350 through a pump outlet 2370. Upon cooling of the shape memory actuator 278, the resiliency of the pumping diaphragm 2340 and the resilient pumping membrane 2330 will cause return of the lever 273 to a starting position determined by a lever stop 2650 and lever catch 2640. Alternately, a return spring (not shown) may be used to return the lever 273 to the starting position. Although shown as a sphere, the force application member 2320 may alternately be a piston, a protrusion of the lever 273 or other suitable form.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 38 schematically shows a sectional view of an embodiment of a valving pump using a resilient cylindrical flexure 2670. In one embodiment, the resilient cylindrical flexure is made from rubber, but in other embodiments, it can be made from any resilient material. The cylindrical flexure 2670 has a central passageway 2675, and a plurality of resilient radial fins 2672 that are sealingly arranged against a housing 2673. Fluid entering through a pump inlet 2310 passes through a channel 2360 and collects in regions upstream of a one way valve 22: a collection chamber 2345, the central passageway 2675 of the cylindrical flexure 2670, and a pumping chamber 2350. The pumping chamber is coupled in fluid communication with the collection chamber 2345 through the central passageway 2675. During the pumping mechanism's compression stroke, a pumping actuation member 2320 applies force to, and deforms, a resilient pumping membrane 2330 until the resilient pumping membrane 2330 is sealingly held against a valve seat . 2680 of the cylindrical flexure 2670; retrograde flow to the pump inlet 2310 from the collection chamber 2345 is thereby blocked. Continued travel of the pumping actuation member 2320 causes deformation of the cylindrical flexure 2670; the pressure within the pumping chamber 2350 increases until such time that it is ample to open the one way valve 22. Fluid can then flows through a pump outlet 2370.<br>
The pumping actuation member 2320 is shown as a ball shape in FIG. 38. However in other embodiments, the pumping actuation member 2320 can be any shape that can function as described above.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 39, an alternate embodiment of the cylindrical flexure 2670 (shown in FIG. 38) employing a resilient portion 2680 and a rigid cylindrical support 2690 is shown.  Like the cylindrical flexure 2680 of FIG. 38, the resilient portion of the cylindrical flexure 2670 includes a valve seat 2680 which seals the central passageway 2675 upon application of force by a pumping actuation member 2320. Thus, the resilient portion 2680 of the cylindrical flexure 2670 deforms to transmit pressure to the pumping chamber 2350.<br>
FIGS. 40-44 schematically show sectional views of an alternate embodiment of a valving pump in various states of actuation. The valving pumps 2200 of FIGS.<br>
 <br>
n\)-w nave a resuienr aiapnragm spring eiuo and a resilient sealing membrane 6120 which together serve a function that is similar to that of the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 of the valving pump 2200 shown in FIGS. 32-34. FIG. 40 shows the valving pump 2200 in a resting state. In the resting state, fluid may flow from the inlet 2360, into an upper portion 2346 of the collection chamber 2345, through an aperture 6110 in the diaphragm spring 6100 and into a lower portion 2347 of the collection chamber 2345. Fluid then may proceed through one or more openings 6130 in a sealing membrane 6120 and into the pumping chamber 2350. Under low-pressure conditions, further fluid flow is hindered by a one way valve 22. The spring-diaphragm 6100 and sealing membrane 6120 may both be constructed from resilient, biocompatible materials. The spring diaphragm 6100 may have a greater resiliency than the sealing membrane 6120. For example, the spring diaphragm 6100 may be a circular piece of flexible bio-inert plastic and the sealing membrane 6120 may be a sheet of silicone or fluorosilicone elastomer.<br>
FIGS. 41 and 42 show the valving pump 2200 in two intermediate, partially actuated states. The pumping actuation member 2320 deforms the pumping membrane 2330 and forces it through the collection chamber 2345 and against the spring diaphragm 6100, which, in turn, is deformed and forced against the sealing membrane 6120. At this point in the compression stroke, retrograde flow through either the aperture 6110 of the spring diaphragm 6100, or through openings 6130 in the sealing membrane 6120, or both, are suppressed. Offset placement of the sealing membrane openings 6130 relative to the spring aperture 6100 allows a seal to be created between the spring diaphragm 6100 and the sealing membrane 6120. In some embodiments this seal may be supplemented with a redundant seal between the fill chamber resilient pumping membrane 2330 and the spring diaphragm 6100 (the embodiments of FIGS. 43-44, for example, lack this redundant seal). A circumferential ridge (not shown) around the spring diaphragm aperture 6110 may act as a valve seat to enhance the seal.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 42, continued travel of the pumping actuation member 2320 causes further deformation of the pumping membrane 2330, spring diaphragm 6100, and sealing membrane 6120. As a result, fluid in the pumping<br>
 <br>
chamber 2350 is compressed until the fluid pressure forces the one way valve 22 open; further compression causes fluid egress through the outlet 2370.<br>
An alternate embodiment of the valving pump 2200 of FIGS. 40-42 is shown schematically in FIG. 43. In this embodiment, a pumping actuation member 2320 traverses the resilient pumping membrane 2330. The pumping membrane 2330 is sealingly attached to the circumference of the pumping actuation member 2320 at a midpoint along the length of the pumping actuation member 2320. When actuated, the diaphragm spring aperture 6110 is sealed against backflow by the sealing membrane 6120 alone; the resilient pumping membrane 2330 will not contact the aperture 6110. An alternate embodiment of the device shown in FIG. 40 is shown in FIG. 44.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 45, a sectional view of an alternate embodiment of a combined valving pump 2200 is shown. A shape memory actuator 278 actuates a compression stroke which causes a resilient pump blade 2710 to lever about a fulcrum 274, causing the resilient pumping membrane 2330 to be deformed. The resilient pump blade 2710 and resilient pumping membrane 2330 apply pressure to fluid in a graded pumping chamber 2720 having a shallow region 2730 and a deeper region 2740. Early in the compression stroke, the pump blade 2710 induces the resilient pumping membrane 2330 to obstruct a channel 2360 that connects a pump inlet 2310 to the graded pumping chamber 2720. As the compression stroke continues, force is applied to the fluid in the graded pumping chamber 2720 until the fluid pressure in the graded pumping chamber 2720 is great enough to open a one way valve 22. Fluid then exits a pump outlet 2370. The pump blade 2710 may be constructed entirely or partly from a resilient material such as rubber. In some embodiments, the resilient material includes a non-resilient spline. Alternately, in some embodiments, the resiliency is imparted through a resilient region 2750, thus, the resilient region 2750 is the only resilient part of the pump blade 2710 in these embodiments. In these embodiments, the resilient region 2750 contacts the bottom of the graded pumping chamber 2720. The resiliency of pump blade 2710 allows the compression stroke to continue after the pumping blade 2710 contacts the base 2780 of the shallow region 2730. A<br>
 <br>
return spring (not shown) returns the pump blade 2710 to a starting position during the return stroke.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 46, a sectional view of an alternate embodiment of a pumping mechanism is shown. This embodiment includes a resilient pump blade 2710. The resilient pump blade 2710 includes a resilient region 2830 which provides resiliency to the pump blade 2710.  The resilient region 2830 joins a pumping actuation member 2820 to a pump blade 2810. When used with a valving pump (not shown) the resilient pump blade 2710 of FIG. 42 will occlude the inlet channel (not shown, shown in FIG. 45 as 2360) and then bend at the flexible region 2830 to allow the force application member 2820 to apply further pressure to the fluid in the graded pumping chamber (not shown, shown in FIG. 45 as 2720). The force application member 2820 may be constructed entirely of a resilient material such as rubber. However, in alternate embodiments, only a region that contacts the bottom of the pumping chamber (not shown) is made from resilient material. The resilient pump blade 2710 will return to its relaxed conformation during the return stroke.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 47, a sectional view of another embodiment of pumping mechanism is shown. The pumping mechanism is shown where the lever is at the intermediate stage of actuation with the inlet valve 2941 closed. The pumping mechanism includes a fluid line 2930, a moveable member 2330, which is a membrane in this embodiment, an inlet valve 2941 poppet 2940, a pumping actuation member 2942, a pumping chamber 2350, and an exit valve 22. The inlet valve 2941 and the pumping actuation member 2942 are each actuated by the shape memory actuator 278 which is surrounded by return spring 276 and connected to a lever 273. The lever 273 actuates both the inlet valve 2941 and the pumping actuation member 2942. The lever 273 includes an elongate and spring member 2910 that is attached to the lever 273 hinged to fulcrum 274 and terminated in a valve actuation hammer 2946. The spring member 2910 may be curyed. The spring member 2910 biases the position of the valve actuation hammer 2946 away from the lever 273 and toward the inlet valve 2941. The lever 273 has a pump actuation hammer 2948, which is not attached to the spring member 2910, and is positioned adjacent to the pumping actuation member 2942.<br>
 <br>
Electric current causes the shape memory actuator 278 to contract and the lever 273 pivots about the fulcrum 274. The pivoting places the valve actuated hammer 2946 in position to force the inlet valve 2941 closed.   As the shape memory actuator 278 continues to contract, the lever 273 continues pivoting and the pump actuation hammer 2948 forces the pump actuation member 2942 against the pumping chamber 2350, even while further compressing the elongate spring member 2910. Upon achieving sufficient pressure, the fluid pressure opens the exit valve 22, and fluid exits through the valve.<br>
During the relaxation stroke, the return spring 276 unloads and returns the lever 273 to the starting position, releasing the pumping actuation member 2942. The inlet valve 2941 opens. The resiliency of the pumping chamber 2350 causes the pumping chamber 2350 to refill.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 48 and 49 schematically show a cross section of an embodiment in which a pumping mechanism employs a bell crank 7200 and combines a valving pump 2200 with a flow biasing valve. The bell crack 7200 converts force produced by the linear shape memory actuator 278 into a transverse pumping force.   FIG. 48 shows the mechanism in a resting or refilling mode and FIG. 49 shows the mechanism in an actuated state. Contraction of the actuator 278 causes the bell crank 7200 to rotate around a shaft 7210 and press upon the force application member 2320, which drives a resilient membrane 7220 to seal against the resilient pumping diaphragm 2340 and urge fluid from the pumping chamber 2350 toward the dispensing chamber 122. The return spring 276 cooperates with a return spring support 7221 to release the pumping force, causing the pumping chamber 2350 to expand and draw fluid from the reservoir 20. Still referring to FIGS. 48 and 49, the flow biasing valve 4000 is also shown, having a valve spring 4010, a poppet or plunger 4020.<br>
In some of the embodiments of the pumping mechanism described above, one or more aspects of the following valving operation description is relevant. Referring now to FIG. 50, an example of a flow biasing valve 4000 is shown, closed. A valve spring 4010 exerts force on a poppet 4020 to sealingly press a valve<br>
 <br>
membrane 4060 against a valve seat 4070 surrounding a terminal aperture of a valve outlet 4040. The valve seat 4070 may include a circumferentially raised portion to improve sealing. As explained below with references to FIGS. 54-55, back pressure created by the action of a resilient dispensing assembly should be insufficient to cause retrograde flow through the flow biasing valve 4000. As shown in FIG. 51, when the pumping assembly is actuated, sufficient pressure should be generated to unseat the membrane 4060 and the poppet 4020 from the valve seat 4070 thereby allowing fluid to flow from the valve inlet 4030, through an inlet chamber 4050 and to the valve outlet 4040. FIGS. 52-53 shows an alternate valve that has a valve seat 4070 without a circumferentially raised portion.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 54 and 55, illustrations of how an exemplary flow biasing valve discriminates between forward and retrograde flow are shown. FIG. 54 schematically represents the valve in a closed position. Back pressure in the outlet 4040 applies force to a relatively small area of the flexible valve membrane 4060 adjacent to the valve seat 4070 and is thus unable to dislodge the poppet 4020. Referring now to FIG. 55, this FIG. schematically represents the valve during the actuation of a pumping <br>
 <br>
decompress the valve spring 4010 thereby altering the spring 4010 biasing force. The valve spring 4010 biases a plunger 4100 against the valve membrane 4060 to force it against the valve seat. The plunger 4100 serves a force application function similar to the fixed force poppet of the flow biasing valve (shown as 4020 and 4000 respectively, in FIGS. 50-53). Compressing the valve spring 4010 will increase its bias, thereby increasing the cracking pressure. Conversely, decompressing the spring 4010 will decrease its bias and the associated cracking pressure. The valve spring 4010 is positioned coaxially around the shaft of a plunger 4100 and exerts its biasing force on the plunger 4100. In some embodiments, the shaft of the plunger 4100 may be shorter than both the length of the valve spring 4010 and the recess 4080 to allow it to be freely displaced in response to increased fluid pressure in the fluid inlet 4030. The plunger 4100 may be any size necessary to function as desired.   As in the embodiment of FIGS. 50-53, the wetted parts may reside in a disposable portion 2610 and the force application components (e.g., the plunger and spring) may reside in the reusable portion 2620. The principal of operation is also similar; a larger mechanical advantage in the fluid inlet 4030 relative the outlet 4040 favors forward flow versus retrograde flow. Alternately, the plunger 4100 may be replaced by the poppet (shown as 4020 in FIGS. 50-55).   In some embodiments, it may be desirable to eliminate the raised valve seat; in these embodiments, the plunger may be ball shaped or another shape capable <br>
 <br>
the fluid is not pumped through a flow restrictor; rather, the fluid is pumped, having the same impedance, through the cannula 5010.<br>
In both FIGS. 59A and 59B, the volume of fluid pumped to the patient, in one embodiment, is calculated roughly by pump strokes. The length of the stroke will provide for a rough estimate of the volume pumped to the patient.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 59C, a fluid schematic of one embodiment of a fluid pumping device is shown. In this embodiment, fluid is located in a reservoir 20 connected to a fluid line 310 by a septum 6270. Fluid line 310 is in communication with pumping mechanism 16, separated by a membrane 2356. The fluid is pumped to a variable volume delivery chamber 122 and then through a flow restrictor 340 to a cannula 5010 for delivery to a patient.<br>
The volume of fluid delivered is determined using the dispensing assembly 120 which includes an acoustic volume sensing (AVS) assembly, as described above, a variable volume delivery chamber 122, and a dispensing spring 130. Similarly to the pumping mechanism, a membrane 2356 forms the variable volume dispensing chamber 122. The membrane is made of the same material (or, in some embodiments, different material) from the membrane 2356 in the pumping mechanism 16 (described in detail above). The AVS assembly is described in greater detail above.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 59D, an alternate embodiment to the embodiment shown in FIG. 59C, in this embodiment, there is no flow restrictor between the variable volume delivery chamber 122 and the cannula 5010. Referring now to FIG. 59E, an alternate embodiment to the embodiment shown in FIG. 59C is shown, with an alternate pumping mechanism 16.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 59A-59E, the reservoir 20 can be any source of a fluid, including but not limited to a syringe, a collapsible reservoir bag, a glass bottle, a glass vile or any other container capable of safely holding the fluid being delivered. The septum 6270 is the connection point between the fluid line 310<br>
 <br>
and the reservoir 20. Various embodiments of the septum 6270 and the reservoir 20 are described in more detail below.<br>
The fluid delivery device embodiment shown in FIGS. 59A-59E can be used for the delivery of any type of fluid. Additionally, the embodiments can be used as one, two or three separate mating parts. Referring now to FIGS. 60A-60D, the same embodiments described with respect to FIGS. 59A-59D are shown as separated into mating parts. Part X includes the movable parts while part Y includes the fluid line 310 and the membrane 2356. In some embodiments of this design, part Y is a disposable portion while part X is a non-disposable portion. Part X does not come into contact directly with the fluid, part Y is the only part having wetted areas. In the above embodiments, the reservoir 20 can any size and is either integrated into the disposable or a separate disposable part. In either embodiment, the reservoir 20 can be refillable. In embodiments where the reservoir 20 is integrated into the disposable part Y, the reservoir 20 can either be manufactured filled with fluid, or, a patient or user fills the reservoir 20 using a syringe through the septum 6270. In embodiments where the reservoir 20 is a separate mating part, the reservoir 20 can either be manufactured filled with fluid, or, a patient or user fills the reservoir 20 using a syringe (not shown) through the septum 6270 as part of a reservoir loading device (not shown, described in more detail below) or manually using a syringe through the septum 6270. Further detail regarding the process of filling a reservoir 20 is described below.<br>
Although various embodiments have been described with respect to FIGS. 59A-59E and FIGS. 60A-60D, the pumping mechanism can be any pumping mechanism described as embodiments herein or alternate embodiments having similar function and characteristics. For example, referring now to FIG. 61 A, a similar embodiment as that shown in FIG. 59A is shown having a representative block that includes pumping mechanism 16. This is to show that any pumping mechanism 16 described herein or functioning similarly can be used in the fluid pumping device. Likewise, FIG. 6 IB and FIG. 61C are representations of systems encompassing the embodiments FIG. 59B and FIG. 59C respectively.<br>
 <br>
The schematics of a fluid pumping device described above can be implemented in a device usable by a patient. There are a number of embodiments. The device can be a stand-alone device or be integrated into another device. The device can be any size or shape. The device can be either portable or non-portable. The term "portable" means a patient can, transport the device either in a pocket area, strapped to the body, or otherwise. The term "non-portable" means that the device is in a healthcare institution or in the home, but the patient does not carry the device almost everywhere they move. The remainder of this description will focus on portable devices as the exemplary embodiment.<br>
<br>
components that are described with respect to FIGS. 70-70D. Thus, these depictions are not meant to limit the components but rather to illustrate how various components could interrelate in a device.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 62 A, schematics of a stand alone device 10 are shown. The housing 10 can be any shape or size and accommodates the intended use. For example, where the device is used as a patch, the device will be compact enough to be worn as such. Where the device is used as a portable pump, the device will be compact enough to be used accordingly. In some embodiments, the housing is made from plastic, and in some embodiments, the plastic is any injection molded fluid-compatible plastic, for example, polycarbonate. In other embodiments, the housing is made from a combination of aluminum or titanium and plastic or any other material, in some embodiments the materials are light and durable. Additional materials may include, but are not limited to, rubber, steel, titanium, and alloys of the same. As shown in FIG. 62A, the device 10 can be any size or shape desired.<br>
FIGS. 62A - 69B are schematics showing representative embodiments. The exact design is dependant on many factors, including, but not limited to, size of the device, power restrictions and intended use. Thus, FIGS. 62A — 69B are intended to describe the various features of a device and the possible combinations, however, actual devices can be readily designed and implemented by one or ordinary skill in the art. As examples, embodiments of devices are described and shown below. However, these are not intended to be limiting, but rather, are intended to be examples.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 63B, a similar device 10 as shown in FIG. 63A is shown, except in this embodiment, a dispensing assembly is not included. In this embodiment, the volume of fluid delivered will depend on either the pump strokes (number and length), the reservoir 20 (volume and time), both, or any other method described previously with respect to monitoring the volume of fluid delivered.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 63C, a similar device 10 as shown in FIG. 63B is shown, except the device 10 includes a dispensing chamber 122 and sensor housing 5022.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 64 A, one embodiment of the patch pump device 10 is shown. This embodiment is based on the embodiment of the device 10 shown in FIG. 63A. In this embodiment, the patch pump device 10 is divided into two sections: a top X and a base Y. The top X contains the pumping mechanism 16, a dispensing assembly 120 (which is optional, but is shown as an exemplary embodiment), the power supply 15, and the microprocessor and printed circuit board 13. These are the non-wetted elements, i.e., they do not come into direct contact with the fluid. The base Y contains the fluid line 310 and the membrane 2356. Where the reservoir 20 is built into the device, the reservoir is also contained on the base Y. However, in embodiments where the reservoir 20 is a <br>
Referring now to FIG. 65A, in some embodiments, the cannula 5010 is inserted through the housing 5030 directly into the patient. The cannula 5010 is connected to a septum (not shown) connecting the cannula line 5031 to the cannula 5010. Referring now to FIG. 65B, in other embodiments, an insertion set, (including the cannula and tubing, not shown in FIG. 65B, but shown in FIG. 64B as items 5033 and 5010) is used; thus, the tubing 5033 of the insertion set will connect to the cannula line 5030 on one end and will connect to the cannula (not shown) on the opposite end of the tubing.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 64A, in use, the reservoir 20, having fluid contained inside (which, as described above, is either molded into the base Y or is separate and attached to the base Y) is connected to the fluid line 310. The microprocessor on the printed circuit board 13 sends a signal to activate the pumping mechanism 16 and a stroke is initiated through electrical current being applied to the shape memory actuators 278. The fluid flows from the reservoir 20, in the fluid line 310 to the dispensing assembly 120, or AVS assembly. There, the exact volume of fluid inside the AVS chamber is determined and the fluid is forced out of the AVS chamber, to the cannula line 5031 and the cannula housing 5030.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 64B, the device shown in FIG. 64A is shown connected to an insertion set, tubing 5033 and cannula 5010. In FIG. 64C, the base Y of the device is shown using an adhesive patch or pad 3100 to the body of a patient 12. It should be noted that in this embodiment, the element 3100 can be either a pad or patch. However, as described in more detail below, item 3100 is called a patch, and item 3220 is called a pad. For simplicity purposes only, item 3100 is used;<br>
As described below, the adhesive patch can have many embodiments and in some cases, the patch is placed on top of the device. Thus, the patch shown in these embodiments is only one embodiment. As described above, a pad, if used, would be placed in the same location as the patch in FIGS. 64A-64D.<br>
<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 69A-69B, both the sensor housing 5022 and the cannula housing 5030 include an exit to the underside of the base Y, shown in FIG. 69A as 5022 and 5030 respectively. FIG. 69B depicts the embodiment shown in FIG. 69A with the sharps protruding through the housings. The sensor housing accommodates a sensor. In some embodiments, the sensor is an analyte sensor. Analytes sensed include blood glucose, but in other embodiments, this analyte sensor can be any type of analyte sensor desired.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 67B, the base Y is shown on the body of a patient 12. The sensor 5020 is shown having been inserted through the base Y sensor housing 5022 and into the patient 12. Referring now to FIG. 67C, in some embodiments, the cannula 5010 and sensor 5020 are inserted though their respective housing (5030 and 5022) and into the patient 12 simultaneously. Referring next to FIG. 67D, the base Y is shown attached to the patient with both a cannula 5010 and sensor 5020 attached to the patient 12 through the base Y.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 67E, the base Y is shown attached to a patient 12 and the cannula 5010 inserted through the cannula housing 5030. In this embodiment, the sensor housing 5022 is shown without a sensor. However, a sensor 5020 is shown inserted into the patient 12 in another location. Thus, the sensor 5020 is not required to be inserted through the base Y, but embodiments described below relating to monitoring blood glucose and pumping insulin through a cannula can be implemented in this way. Additionally, other embodiments relating to administering a fluid in response or relation to an analyte level can be administered this way.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 67F, the device 10, having both a sensor 5020 and a cannula 5010 through the base Y is shown with the top X placed on. Again, in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 66A-66D, once the top X is placed onto the base Y, the reservoir 20 is fluidly connected to the fluid line 310.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 70-70D, both the patch pump and portable pump embodiments as described additionally contain various components of the dispensing assembly (in applicable embodiments) and for embodiments including the AVS assembly, the various components thereof, including, at least one microphone, a temperature sensor, at least one speaker, a variable volume dispensing chamber, a variable volume chamber, a port and a reference chamber. In some embodiments, the device contains one or more of the following: a vibrator motor (and, in those embodiments, a motor driver), an antenna, a radio, a skin temperature sensor, a bolus button, and in some embodiments, one or more additional buttons. In some embodiments, the antenna is a quarter-wavelength trace antenna. In other embodiments the antenna may be a half-wavelength or quarter wavelength trace, dipole, monopole, or loop antenna. The radio, in some embodiments, is a 2.4 GHz radio, but in other embodiments, the radio is a 400 MHz radio. In still other embodiments, the radio can be any frequency radio. Thus, in some embodiments, the device includes a radio strong enough to communicate to a receiver within a few feet in distance from the device.   In some embodiments, the device includes a second radio. In some embodiments, the second radio may be a specific long-range radio, for example, a 433 or 900 MHz radio or, in some embodiments, any frequency within the ISM band or other bands, Not shown in FIGS. 70-70D, the device, in some embodiments, contains a screen and/or a user interface.<br>
<br>
embodiments, are shown in a schematic representing the electrical connections of those components. FIGS. 70-70D therefore represent the various elements that could be included in the device. These can be mixed and matched depending on size requirements, power restrictions, usage and preferences, as well as other variables. FIG. 70 shows the relation of FIGS. 70A-70D.<br>
The device contains at least one microprocessor 271. This can be any speed microprocessor capable of processing, at a minimum, the various electrical connections necessary for the device to function. In some embodiments, the device contains more than one microprocessor, as seen in FIGS. 70A-70B, the device is shown having two microprocessors 271.<br>
The microprocessor 271 (or in some embodiments, microprocessors) is connected to the main printed circuit board (hereinafter, the "PCB" refers to the term "printed circuit board") 13. A power source, which in some embodiments is a battery 15, is connected to the main PCB 13. In one embodiment, the battery 15 is a lithium polymer battery capable of being recharged. In other embodiments, the battery can be a replaceable battery or a rechargeable battery of any type.<br>
In some embodiments, the device includes a radio 370 connected to the main PCB 13. The radio 370 communicates to a remote controller 3470 using the antenna 3580. The communication between the device 10 and the remote controller 3470 is therefore wireless. <br>
In some embodiments, the device contains a vibration motor 3210. The vibration motor 3210 is connected to a motor driver 3211 on the main PCB 13 motor driver 3211.<br>
The NITINOL circuit (referring to the shape memory actuator, which in some embodiments, is a NITINOL strand) 278 on the main PCB 13 provides electrical current to the NITINOL connectors. As shown in FIG. 67F and FIG. 70A, the device can include two NITINOL connectors 278 (and two NITINOL strands). However, as described above, in some embodiments, the device includes one NITINOL connector (and one NITINOL strand).<br>
In some embodiments, the device includes a temperature sensor 3216 shown on FIG. 70B The temperature sensor 3216 is located on the underside of the base Y and senses the temperature of the patient's skin. The skin temperature sensor 3216 is connected to a signal conditioner, represented by 3217. As shown in FIG. 70B, the signal conditioning 3217 is represented as one block, however the device includes multiple signal conditioners, as needed, each filtering different the signals. Following, the AVS temperature sensor 132, AVS microphones 133, and<br>
 <br>
analyte sensor 5020 are all connected to a signal conditioner, represented in one block as 3217.<br>
The AVS speaker 134 is connected to the speaker drive 135 on the main PCB 13. The AVS speaker 134, in one embodiment, is a hearing aid speaker. However, in other embodiments, the speaker 134 (a speaker containing a voice coil, a magnet with an electromagnetic coil) is a piezo speaker (shown in FIG. 50, representing one embodiment of the device).<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, the disposable portion 2610 may include the reservoir 20 and optionally, a battery. The reservoir 20 may be integral to the disposable portion or otherwise coupled to the disposable portion. The battery may be the primary or sole power source for the device or may be a backup power source, and may be used to provide electrical power to electronics on the reusable portion and/or the disposable portion. Both the reservoir 20 and the battery will typically require regular replacement, so including both of these components in the disposable portion 2610 may provide to the user the increased convenience of simultaneous replacement. Additionally, by replacing the battery every time the reservoir is changed, the user may be less likely to allow the battery to run down.<br>
The disposable portion 2610 could additionally or alternatively include a processor that may be used, for example, to continue certain device operations in<br>
More generally, the device may be configured to obtain status information from any of the disposables (including, for example, the disposable portion 2610 and any disposable component used therewith, such as the fluid reservoir, battery, or sharps cartridge or individual sharps component), for example, from a processor disposed in disposable portion, via bar code reader, or via RFID technology. If the device detects a problem with the disposables (e.g., invalid model number for use with the reusable portion or an expiration date of the fluid has passed), then the device may take remedial action, such as, for example, preventing or terminating operation of the device and generating an appropriate alarm.<br>
<br>
The alarms can also be used to indicate to a user that the device is working properly. For example, a user might program the device for a bolus delivery over a certain period of time. The user may desire to know that the programmed delivery is occurring properly.  The processor can use the vibrating motor or an audio sound to indicate successful programmed delivery. Thus, some mechanisms can be employed in some embodiments of the device to provide feedback, whether positive or negative, to the patient or user<br>
In many embodiments, the base Y and the reservoir 20 are disposable portions and the top X is a non-disposable portion. Both the infusion device 5010 and the analyte sensor are also disposable.<br>
As previously discussed, the patch pump device may be entirely or partially disposable. FIG. 72 shows an embodiment of a fluid delivery device 10 having disposable and non-disposable portions. In this embodiment, the disposable portion Y contains components that come into direct contact with the fluid,<br>
Referring now to FIG. 74, the device 10 shown in FIG. 49 is shown. The base disposable portion Y includes a reservoir cavity 2645. The top non-disposable portion X includes battery 15 and a dispensing assembly 120. A microphone 133 is shown as well as a diaphragm spring 130. In some embodiments, the dispensing assembly 120 includes more than one microphone. Although throughout this description, each microphone is referred to as 133, this does not infer that the microphones are always identical. In some embodiments, the microphones are the same, in other embodiments, the microphones are different.<br>
In the FIG. 74, the top non-disposable portion X also includes main PCB 13, a vibration motor 3210 and a pumping actuation member 54. The top, non-disposable portion X includes the AVS assembly or dispensing assembly 120. In FIG. 74, a microphone 133 is shown. The top, non-disposable portion X also includes a battery 15, which may be used to provide electrical power to electronics on the non-disposable portion and/or the disposable portion. In some embodiments, this battery 15 is rechargeable. Recharging can be done by methods described below. The disposable portion Y includes the wetted components including a fluid line (not shown) and the pumping assembly. In FIG. 74, only the pumping plunger 54 can be seen. This embodiment of the device 10 can also include many of the elements described above, including, but<br>
84<br>

Referring now to FIG. 78, an exploded view of another embodiment of the device 10 is shown. The top non-disposable portion X is mostly dome shaped, however, a protrusion XI is shown to accommodate the mechanisms inside the top X. Thus, the shape of the device can vary and can include polyps and protrusions, dimples and other texture-like features to accommodate various designs of the device.<br>
<br>
Referring now to FIG. 79, the base Y includes a variable volume dispensing chamber 122, an inlet valve 21, and exit valve 22 and a pumping chamber 2350. As shown in this figure, those elements are shown as the membrane covering the area that acts as either the chambers or the valves. Thus, the base Y includes the membrane that securely maintains the wetted areas, thus, maintaining the non wetted areas as such in the top (not shown). As shown in FIG. 79, the sensor 5020 and the infusion device 5010 have been inserted into their respective housings and through the base Y to the patient (not shown). The base Y is shown with the reservoir cavity 2645, but the reservoir (not shown) need to be connected so that the fluid lines from the reservoir to the chamber and to the infusion device are connected.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 8IA-81C, a sequence is shown to illustrate the process of sandwiching the reservoir 20 between the top X and base Y. As seen in FrG. 81 A, the top X as well as the reservoir 20 outside of the top X are shown. The reservoir includes a septum 6270.   The top X includes a reservoir relief 2640. Next, as shown in FIG. 8IB, the top is prepared to sandwich with the base Y. Referring now to FIG. 81C, the reservoir 20 is placed, septum side down, inside the base Y. The septum will connect with a cannulated septum needle (not shown) inside the base Y and connect the reservoir to the fluid line (not shown). In alternate embodiments, the reservoir may include a cannulated needle rather than a septum and the fluid path may include a reservoir interface with a septum rather than a cannulated needle.<br>
Referring next to FIG. 82, the top X is shown with one embodiment of the pumping mechanism 16 exploded. The pumping mechanism 16 fits into the pumping mechanism housing 18 in the top X. The base Y is also shown as well as one part of the latch 654 that will clamp the top X and base Y together.<br>

Referring now to FIGS. 85C-85D, the device 10 is the latching mechanism 654 is shown in an open position (FIG. 85C) and a clamped or closed position (FIG. 85D). The bolus button 3213, as described in further detail above, can also be seen.<br>
Cannula and Inserter<br>
FIG. 86A schematically shows a representative embodiment of the infusion and sensor assembly 5040 including both an infusion device, which can be a cannula or a needle 5010 and an analyte sensor, which includes a sensor probe 5025 and a sensor base 5023. A bridge 5070 rigidly joins an infusion cannula 5010 and the analyte sensor base 5023. The infusion device 5010 is bounded on an upper side by a septum 5060 which allows for fluid to flow from a source and be administered through an infusion device 5010 to a patient.   The sensor base 5023 is the section of the analyte sensor that is not inserted into the patient.   In one embodiment, the base 5023 contains electronic contacts for the electrochemical analysis of blood glucose. A probe 5025 protrudes from the base 5023 of the analyte sensor 5020.<br>
<br>
both the infusion device 5010 and sensor probe 5025 into the patient. Once in the patient, releases 5052 are actuated through holes, separating the infusion device 5010 and septum 5060, as well as the sensor base 5023, from the bridge 5070. Referring to FIG. 86B, where introduction needles 5240 and 5072 are used, they will typically remain attached to the bridge 5070 following insertion.<br>
The inserter 5011 could be operated manually, but could also be incorporated into another inserter device such that a mechanical advantage can be applied. Referring now to FIGS. 88A-88B, one embodiment of an inserter device 5013 is used with an apparatus similar to the inserter 5012 shown in FIGS. 87A-87E. The mechanism of the inserter device 5013 is shown in FIGS. 88C-88D. An actuation lever 5014 either releases a spring (as shown in FIGS. 88C-88D) or provides another mechanical advantage that allows for the inserter 5012 to be inserted<br>
 Features may be included for securing the infusion and sensor assembly 5040 to an automatic inserter. For example, the releases shown in FIGS. 86A-86B as 5052 may receive pins of an automatic insertion device. Referring to both FIGS. 89A and 89B a representative embodiment of an automatic inserter 5100 is shown. As shown in the front view of FIG. 89A, the inserter 5100 includes pins 5130 which travel in pin slots 5140 within an inserting cartridge recess 5120. In practice, the infusion and sensor assembly (not shown, shown in FIGS. 86A and 86B as 5040) is pressed into the cartridge recess 5120, causing pins 5130 to be inserted into the holes in the infusion and sensor assembly (shown as 5052 in FIGS. 86A and 86B). As shown in the rear view of FIG. 89B, a cocking lever 5145 is used to ready the inserter 5100 for firing. The inserter 5100 is then either held against the skin or aligned with a cannula housing and sensor housing on a base (not shown) and fired by pressing a trigger 5110. Upon firing, the pins 5130 travel in their slots 5140, thereby forcing the infusion device and sensor (both not shown) into a patient. Inserter <br>
Referring now to FIGS. 91A-91C, several views of an embodiment of an inserter mechanism for an inserter, such as the one shown in FIGS. 89A and 89B as 5100, are shown. FIG. 91A shows a perspective view, FIG. 91B shows a front view, and FIG. 91C shows a side view of one embodiment of an inserter mechanism. The inserter 5100 has a cocking lever 5145, which connects via cocking linkages 5350 to a hammer cocking slide 5330, and is used to move the cocking slide 5330 to a charged position. A power spring 5390 connects the hammer cocking slide 5330 to a trigger 5110 and, when compressed, provides the downward force necessary for insertion of an infusion device or an infusion and sensor assembly (not shown). A trigger hammer 5340 is disposed under the hammer cocking slide 5330 and between a pair of cocking linkages 5350; the trigger hammer 5340 transmits the kinetic energy that is released from the power spring 5390 upon pressing the trigger 5110. The energized trigger hammer 5340 impacts a cartridge bolt 5380, positioned below. The cartridge bolt 5380 is linked to a cartridge housing 5370, which holds the cartridge, for example, the one shown in FIG. 90. The cartridge bolt 5380 is also disposed atop a return spring 5360 for returning the cartridge housing 5350 to a retracted position.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 93A-93C, one embodiment of a temporal sequence for inserting and securing an infusion device (i.e., cannula or needle 5010) into a base Y is shown. FIG. 93A shows a base Y with a locking feature 5210 positioned above a cannula housing 5030. The base Y is typically positioned against the skin of a patient 5220 when inserting ah infusion device or cannula 5010.   FIG. 93B shows a cannula 5010 being forced through the cannula housing 5030 in the base Y. In this figure, an introduction needle 5240 is used that traverses a septum (not shown) and is positioned coaxially in the cannula 5010; a sharp point of the introduction needle 5240 emerges from the tip (not shown) of the cannula 5010 to help puncture a patient 5220. The resilient locking feature 5210 is pushed aside during insertion of the cannula 5010. FIG. 93C shows the cannula 5010 fully inserted through the cannula housing 5030 of the base Y, with the tip of the cannula fully inserted into the patient 5220. The introduction needle 5240 has been removed and the septum 5060 has self-sealed to a fluid source or fluid line (not shown). The resilient locking feature 5210 is engaged with the cannula 5010, thereby preventing the cannula 5010 from moving in relation to the base Y. Although FIGS. 93A-93C show a cannula 5010, the infusion and sensor assembly shown in FIGS. 86B can be inserted using the locking feature 5210 and method shown and described in FIGS. 93A-93C.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 92G-92H, an inserting cartridge bolt locking mechanism for use with an inserter, such as the one shown in FIGS. 91A-92F, as 5100 is shown. The cartridge bolt locking mechanism can function as an interlock to prevent accidental firing while the mechanism is being cocked. The locking mechanism includes a catch 5420, which when engaged in a catch recess 5410,<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 94A-94C, one embodiment of the process of mating a cannula 5010, where the cannula is a traditional cannula requiring an introduction needle (as shown in FIG. 86B) to the base Y and establishes fluid communication with a fluid line 310 is shown. FIG. 94A shows a sectional view of a cannula 5010 with two septa: an introduction needle septum 5062 and a fluid line septum 5270. The introduction needle septum 5062 seals a passageway 5280 leading to the hollow needle (not shown, shown in FIG. 94B as 5290) of the cannula 5010. A cannula introduction needle 5240 is shown positioned above the introduction needle septum 5062 and just prior to insertion of the introduction needle 5240.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 94B, the introduction needle 5240 is shown inserted through the introduction needle septum 5062. A user mates the cannula 5010 into the base Y, which has an upwardly-pointing rigid, hollow needle 5290. During insertion of the cannula 5010 into the base Y, the introduction needle 5240 punctures the fluid line septum 5270 to establish fluid communication between the fluid line 310 and the passageway 5280. If the base Y is held against a patient (not shown) during insertion of the cannula 5010 into the base Y, fluid communication between the fluid line 310 and the passageway 5280 will be established at about the same time that the patient's skin is pierced. Referring now to FIG. 94C,<br>
<br>
Adhesion<br>
Referring now to FIG. 95 a top perspective view of one embodiment of an adhesive patch 3100 for securing an object, such as a fluid delivery device 10, to the skin of a patient (not shown) is shown. Although the adhesive patch 3100 is shown in the present shape, other shapes can be used. Any adhesive patch 3100 that can securely hold a fluid delivery device can be used.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the backing for the central region 3130 may be removable without removing the backing to the adhesive members 3111.  To use the adhesive patch 3100, a user removes the backing of the central region 3130 and presses the device 10 against the newly exposed adhesive of the central region to attach the device 10 to the central region 3130. The user then places the device against the skin, removes the backing from an adhesive member 3111, affixes the adhesive member to the skin, and repeats the affixation process with additional members. A user may affix all of the adhesive members 3111 or only some of the members, and save additional adhesive members 3111 for application on another day. Since adhesives typically used for attachment to skin only remain securely <br>
FIG. 96 schematically shows a sectional view of a fluid delivery device 10, with an inserted cannula 5010, held securely under an adhesive patch 3100. A pad 3220 may be included between the device 10 and a patient's skin 3250 and allow air to flow to the skin. Air flow to skin may be increased by the inclusion of passageways 3230 in the pad 3220. Passageways 3230 may also be formed by using multiple pads that are spaced apart or by constructing pad 3220 from a highly porous material. Thus, the pad 3220 can be any shape and size and in some embodiments, the pad 3220 is made up of a number of separate pieces.    Pads 3220 may be either adhered to the underside of the device 10 during manufacture or may be adhered to the device 10 by a user. Alternately, the pad 3220 may be loosely placed onto the skin by a user prior to application of the adhesive patch<br>
 <br>
3100. The pad 3220 may include a compliant material, such as porous polymeric foam.<br>
FIG. 97 shows an embodiment of the invention that uses a first adhesive patch 3100 and an additional adhesive patch 3300 to secure a device (not shown) to a patient. First, a device (not shown) is positioned for use and secured to the skin (not shown) of a patient with an adhesive patch 3100 using tab-like adhesive members 3111. The central region 3130 may be positioned atop (as shown), or secured below, the device. After a period of time, either prolonged or short, a second adhesive patch 3300 is positioned so that its central region sits atop the first adhesive patch 3100 and the second adhesive patch's adhesive members 3320 are secured to the skin of the patient in the intervening regions between the first adhesive patch's adhesive members 3111. Frangible regions may be provided to aid in the removal of loose or unwanted adhesive members 3111 associated with the earlier placed patch 3100.<br>
Referring now to both FIGS. 98 and 99, embodiments in which an adhesive patch 3100 has been divided into at least two smaller adhesive patches are shown. In these embodiments, the adhesive patch 3100 is divided into two adhesive patches, 3410 and 3420, each having adhesive members 3111 radially arranged around a central void 3430. The two adhesive patches, 3410 and 3420, each span a semi¬circle of about 180°, but other configurations could be used such as: three patches, each spanning 120,° or four patches each spanning 90°. In some embodiments, the adhesive can include greater than four patches. The configurations described with respect to these embodiments follow the formula 3607n where n is the number of patches. But, in other embodiments, depending on the shape of the device, the formula shown and described here does not apply. In still other embodiments, the patches may also cover more than 360°, and thus overlap.<br>
As shown in the perspective view of FIG. 99, due to the presence of a central void (not shown, shown in FIG. 98), the central region 3130 is in the form of a thin strip for adherently positioning along the perimeter of the device 10. The two patches, 3410 and 3420, together securely attach the device 10 to the skin (not shown). As in the embodiment described with reference to FIG. 95, air may flow<br>
 <br>
between the adhesive members 3111 and under the device 10, especially if passageways 3230 are provided.<br>
FIG. 100 shows a perspective view of an embodiment that includes using the multiple adhesive patches to extend the time during which a device 10 remains adhered to a patient (not shown) before removal. One of the multiple partial adhesive pads 3420 is removed while the device 10 is held in place (either by a remaining adhesive patch 3410 and/or by a user). The removed adhesive patch 3420 is then replaced with a fresh replacement adhesive patch (not shown). The replacement adhesive patch may be identical to the removed pad 3420 or may have adhesive members 3111 that are positioned in an alternate configuration to allow adhesion to the fresh skin between the areas previously covered by adhesive patch 3420. The remaining adhesive patch 3410 may then be replaced in a similar manner. Indicia such as color coding may be used to indicate the age of the adhesive patches. The patches may also have a color change mechanism to indicate that their useful life has expired. Decorative patterns, such as images and designs, may be included on the patches.<br>
Clamping and Latching<br>
FIGS. 102A-102C schematically show one mechanism for clamping or latching together a top portion and a base portion of a fluid delivery device.   Referring first to FIG. 102A, an elevation view of a clamp 6410 is shown.   FIG. 102B<br>
 <br>
shows a base portion Y with keyholes 6440 for two clamps; corresponding keyholes may also be included in the top portion (not shown). Referring now to FIG. 102C, the top X and the base Y may be aligned and a clamp 6410 may be inserted through the keyholes (not shown, shown in FIG. 102B as 6440). Rotating the clamp 6410 by 90° causes a stud bar 6430 to move into a locking position. Depressing a cam lever 6400 engages a cam 6415, that is hingedly connected to a clamp pin 6420, to push against the top X. As a result, the top X and the base Y are held with a clamping force between the cam 6415 and the stud bar 6430. Raising the cam lever 6400 releases the clamping force and the clamp 6410 may be rotated by 90° and withdrawn to allow disassembly of the top X and base Y. In some embodiments, the lever may act as a protective cover for the top X.<br>
Reservoir<br>
Exemplary embodiments of collapsible reservoirs for holding fluids are shown in FIGS. 104-106C. The collapsible reservoir has at least one section or wall that collapses as fluid is withdrawn, thereby maintaining ambient pressure in its interior. In most embodiments, a sealable port (e.g., a septum) is included in the reservoir. The port allows the reservoir to be filled with fluid by a syringe and also, for a leak free connection to a fluid line. Alternately, an adaptor may be used to connect the reservoir with the fluid line. Alternately, as shown above withFIG. 105 shows a perspective view of the inside of the collapsible reservoir 20. A rim 6230 allows attachment of the flexible reservoir membrane, which may be attached by welding, clamping, adhering, or other suitable method to create a fluid tight seal. A guard structure 6290 may be included to allow fluid to flow to or from the cavity 2645, but prevents a needle from entering the cavity, thereby preventing it from possible puncture of the reservoir membrane.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 107 a reservoir filling station 7000 for filling a reservoir 20 with a fluid is shown. The fluid may be withdrawn from its original container with a syringe 7040 and introduced into the reservoir 20 by using the fill station 7000. The fill station 7000 may include a substantially rigid fill station base 7010 hinged to a substantially rigid fill station cover 7020 via a hinge 7030. Accordingly, the station 7000 may be opened and closed to accept and hold the reservoir 20. A needle 7050 attached to the syringe 7040 may then be inserted through a filling aperture 7060 in the cover 7020, and through the reservoir septum 6270. Since the fill station cover 7020 is rigid, it establishes a limit of travel upon <br>
A fluid delivery system typically includes a fluid delivery device and an external user interface, although in some embodiments a complete or partial internal user interface is included in the device. The device can be any device as described herein or a variation thereof.<br>
FIG. 109A shows a flow diagram of a data acquisition and control scheme for an exemplary embodiment of a fluid delivery system. A patient or caregiver utilizes an external user interface 14 which is typically a base station or hand held unit housed separately from the fluid delivery device 10. In some embodiments, the user interface 14 is integrated with a computer, cell phone, personal digital assistance, or other consumer device. The user interface assembly may be in continuous or intermittent <br>
FIG. 109B shows an alternate embodiment of the flow diagram in FIG. 102A. In this embodiment, the lack of dispensing assembly/sensor removes the feedback based on volume of fluid.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 110A, a flow chart of one embodiment of the overall operation of a fluid delivery device within the fluid delivery system is shown. A user starts 2800 the system using a switch or from an external user interface (step 2800). The system initializes by loading default values, running system tests (step 2810) and obtaining variable parameters such as desired basal and bolus doses. Variable parameters may be selected by the user using the user interface, either using an input device such as a touch screen on the user interface or by loading saved parameters from memory (step 2820). The <br>
Referring now to FIG. Ilia layout of an embodiment using coils for inductive charging and wireless communication in a fluid delivery system is shown.   As previously described, the user interface assembly 14 can be embodied as a hand held user interface assembly 14 that wirelessly communicates with the fluid delivery device 10. A secondary coil (i.e. a solenoid) 3560 may be employed in the fluid delivery device 10 as a wireless transceiver antenna in conjunction with wireless controller 3580. The secondary coil 3560 may also serve as a secondary transformer for recharging the device battery 3150, at least partially, in conjunction with a battery recharging circuit 3540.   In this embodiment, the user<br>
 <br>
interface assembly 14 contains a primary coil 3490 for inductively coupling energy to a secondary coil 3560. When the user interface assembly 14 is in close proximity to the fluid delivery device 10, the primary coil 3490 energizes the secondary coil 3560. The energized secondary coil 3560 powers a battery recharging circuit 3540 for recharging the battery 3150 in the fluid delivery device 10. In some embodiments, the primary coil 3490 also functions as an antenna to transmit and receive information from the fluid delivery device 10 in conjunction with a wireless controller 3470.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 112, some embodiments include long range wireless communication (e.g., 20-200 ft or more) hardware in the fluid delivery device 10. Thus, the fluid delivery device 10 could be monitored from a distance.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 112, an intermediate transceiver 6600, typically carried by the patient, can provide the benefits of long range communication without increasing the size, weight and power consumption of the fluid delivery device 10. As shown in the data flow diagram of FIG. 112, a wearable fluid delivery device 10 uses short range hardware and associated software to transmit data to, or receive data from, the intermediate transceiver 6600. For example, the device 10 may be equipped to transmit data over distances of approximately 3-10 ft. The intermediate transceiver 6600 may then receive this data and use long range hardware and software to relay this data to a user interface assembly 14. The intermediate transceiver 6600 may also accept control signals from the user interface assembly 14 and relay these signals to the device 10. Optionally, the user interface assembly 14 may also be capable of communicating directly with the fluid delivery device 10, when in range. This direct communication may be configured to occur only when the intermediate transceiver 6600 is not detected, or alternatively, <br>
Optionally, the microprocessor 6630 analyzes received data to detect the presence<br>
of malfunctions or maintenance needs associated with the device. Some examples<br>
of fault conditions include, but are not limited to:<br>
The power supply 6670 may be rechargeable, and may store sufficient energy to operate continuously for a period of time, for example, at least 10 hours. However, the operation time will vary based on use and device. The size of the fluid delivery device may be reduced so that it may easily be carried in a pocket, purse, briefcase, backpack or the like. One embodiment of the device includes a means to withstand routine shocks or spills. Additional features may be included in some embodiments, including, but not limited to, decorative features, or any of a wide range of consumer electronics capabilities such as the ability to play video games, send and receive instant messages, watch digital video, play music, etc. Third party controls may be included to remove or limit the use of such functions during some or all <br>
Referring now to FIGS. 115 and 116. One embodiment of an apparatus is shown for recharging the battery 7100. In FIG. 15, the top, non-disposable portion of a fluid delivery device 2620 is shown disconnected from the base, disposable portion of a fluid delivery device. The battery recharger 7100 is used to recharge the battery (not shown) in the top 2620. In FIG. 116, the top 2620 is shown on the battery recharger 7100. The latches 6530 are shown closed, connecting the top 2620 to the battery recharger 7100. Thus, the latch 6530 used to connect a top portion 2620 to a base portion (not shown) is also used to connect the top 2620 to the battery recharger 7100. Docking may establish a direct power connection, or power may be transferred by way of inductive coupling. Also, in some embodiments of the system, the patient employs multiple non-disposable portions 2620 in rotation; i.e., recharging one non-disposable portion 2620, while using a second non-disposable portion (not shown).<br>
Furthermore, while various embodiments are described herein with reference to a non-pressurized reservoir, it should be noted that a pressurized reservoir may be used in certain embodiments or under certain conditions (e.g., during priming and/or air purging). Among other things, a pressurized reservoir might facilitate filling of the pump chamber, for example, following retraction of the pump actuation member 54 shown and described with reference to FIGs. 15A-15D.<br>
Additionally, while various embodiments are described herein with reference to a pump motor disposed in a reusable portion of a housing, it should be noted that a pump and/or a pump motor may alternatively be situated in the disposable portion, for example, along with various components that come into contact with the fluid. As with some of the other motors described herein, a motor disposed in the disposable portion may include one or more shape-memory actuators.<br>
It should be noted that section headings are included for convenience and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
In various embodiments, the herein disclosed methods including those for controlling and measuring flow of a fluid and for establishing communication amongst linked components may be implemented as a computer program product for use with a suitable controller or other computer system (referred to generally herein as a "computer system")- Such implementations may include a series of computer instructions fixed either on a tangible medium, such as a computer readable medium (e.g., a diskette, CD-ROM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or fixed disk) or transmittable to a computer system, via a modem or other interface device, such as a communications adapter connected to a network over a medium. The medium may be either a tangible medium (e.g., optical or analog communications lines) or a medium implemented with wireless techniques (e.g., microwave, infrared or other transmission techniques). The series of computer<br>
 <br>
instructions may embody desired functionalities previously described herein with respect to the system. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that such computer instructions can be written in a number of programming languages for use with many computer architectures or operating systems.<br>
Furthermore, such instructions may be stored in any memory device, such as semiconductor, magnetic, optical or other memory devices, and may be transmitted using any communications technology, such as optical, infrared, acoustic, radio, microwave, or other transmission technologies. It is expected that such a computer program product may be distributed as a removable medium with accompanying printed or electronic documentation (e.g., shrink wrapped software), preloaded with a computer system (e.g., on system ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or fixed disk), or distributed from a server or electronic bulletin board over the network (e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web). Of course, some embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a combination of both software (e.g., a computer program product) and hardware.
