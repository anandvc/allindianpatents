POROUS CELLULOSE AGGREGATE AND MOLDING<br>
COMPOSITION THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a porous<br>
cellulose aggregate that is useful mainly as an<br>
excipient in the field of chemical engineering, in<br>
particular, of pharmaceuticals and of foods, and a<br>
compacting (molding) composition thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In the fields of pharmaceuticals, foods and<br>
other chemical engineering and the like, it has been a<br>
general practice conventionally to prepare a molded<br>
body containing an active ingredient using cellulose<br>
particles such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose<br>
powder and the like as an excipient, and for these<br>
cellulose particles, good compactibility, fluidity and<br>
disintegration property are required.<br>
[0003]<br>
Patent Document 1 describes a porous<br>
cellulose aggregate (corresponding to Comparative<br>
Example 15-17) having a secondary aggregate structure<br>
formed by aggregation of primary cellulose particles,<br><br>
the aggregate having a pore volume within a particle of<br>
0.265 cm3/g to 2.625 cm3/g, containing type I crystals,<br>
and having an average particle size of more than 30 µm<br>
and 250 µm or less, a specific surface area of 1.3-20<br>
m2/g, a repose angle of 25° or more and less than 44°<br>
and properties to disintegrate in water, and a method<br>
for producing the aforementioned porous cellulose<br>
aggregate comprising a step of drying a dispersion<br>
containing two or more groups of primary cellulose<br>
particles having a different average particle size and<br>
a liquid medium wherein the cellulose dispersion<br>
particles have an average particle size of 1 to 110 µm.<br>
Since the aforementioned porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the Patent Document requires two or more groups of<br>
primary cellulose particles having a different average<br>
particle size, different primary cellulose particles<br>
prepared by two processes such as grinding dried acid<br>
insoluble residue of commercially available pulp and<br>
the like have to be mixed as described in Example of<br>
the Patent Document. On the other hand the porous<br>
cellulose particles of the present invention can be<br>
obtained advantageously with a single process without<br>
going through a process of grinding or the like. The<br>
porous cellulose aggregates of the present invention<br>
can be obtained by a single process by making the<br>
primary cellulose particles to have a specified range<br>
of average width and average thickness and by making<br>
flexible, thereby promoting entanglement of primary<br><br>
cellulose particles without being limited by the major<br>
axis of the primary cellulose particles, in other words<br>
by giving self aggregation ability thereto, and are<br>
clearly different from that described in the Patent<br>
Document in terms of the production method. In<br>
addition, because the pore size of the secondary<br>
aggregate structure of the porous cellulose particles<br>
according to the Patent Document is smaller than that<br>
of the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention, and the swelling degree is lower in water,<br>
the disintegration property is sometimes not sufficient<br>
for making tablets for a formulation that severely<br>
requires disintegration property in the case of drugs<br>
which is insoluble in water, and even in the case of<br>
soluble drugs, when a water repellent additives such as<br>
magnesium stearate and the like has to be added to<br>
avoid problems in tablet pressing such as sticking and<br>
the like. We have investigated in detail the particle<br>
structure which controls disintegration property, and<br>
as a result confirmed again that the cellulose<br>
particles having a high swelling property have a high<br>
disintegration property, and we realized that for<br>
conventional cellulose powder, if the swelling property<br>
is high, the compactibility is not sufficient, and<br>
conversely if the compactibility is high, the swelling<br>
property is low. That is, no cellulose powder having<br>
both a high compactibility and high swelling property<br>
has been known. We searched for a method to make the<br><br>
particles porous while keeping the pore diameter of<br>
porous cellulose particles as large as possible and<br>
have managed to solve the aforementioned problem. That<br>
is, we found that excess aggregation can be controlled,<br>
and the inside of the particles can be made porous<br>
while keeping the pore diameter large by using primary<br>
cellulose particles having a specified range of average<br>
width and average thickness and giving self-aggregation<br>
ability thereto. For the porous cellulose aggregates<br>
of Patent Document 1, it is described that when two or<br>
more groups of cellulose particles having different<br>
particle size are mixed, and the cellulose dispersion<br>
is dried, the dispersed cellulose particles having a<br>
small average particles size enter between the<br>
dispersed cellulose particle components having a large<br>
average particle size, and for this reason an excess<br>
aggregation of the dispersed cellulose particles having<br>
the larger average particle size is inhibited, and a<br>
large pore volume is created in the secondary aggregate<br>
structure. However, since tight aggregation is formed<br>
among two or more groups of cellulose having different<br>
average particle size, the pore diameter of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates obtained by the method<br>
particularly disclosed in the Example was measured to<br>
be small, about 1.5 µm. Since the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention uses the single<br>
primary cellulose particles, they are not aggregated as<br>
tightly as the porous cellulose aggregate of the Patent<br><br>
Document and they are different in having a minimum 3<br>
µm pore diameter. For the size of pore diameter, the<br>
Patent Document describes that a clear peak can be<br>
recognized in the range of 0.1-10 µm and the median<br>
pore diameter, which is a peak top of the pore<br>
distribution and closely related to water permeability<br>
into the particles, is preferably 0.3 µm or larger, and<br>
that although a larger median pore diameter is better,<br>
it is at most 5 µm considering its distribution. It is<br>
described that with a larger median pore diameter,<br>
there is better disintegration property, but it is<br>
speculated that in practice it is difficult to obtain a<br>
large median pore diameter of 3 urn or larger by the<br>
production method according to the Patent Document.<br>
The porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention has an advantage that porous cellulose<br>
aggregates having a large median pore diameter of 3 µm<br>
or above, which can not be obtained by the production<br>
method of the Patent Document, can be prepared by a<br>
single step without requiring mixing of the different<br>
primary cellulose particles prepared through two steps.<br>
Patent Document 2 describes porous cellulose<br>
particles (corresponding to Comparative 6 of the<br>
present application) having a crystal structure type I,<br>
having pores of diameter of 0.1 µm or above and a<br>
porous rate of 20% or above and containing 90% by<br>
weight or above of a fraction with 350 mesh and above,<br>
which is obtained by mixing cellulose particles with<br><br>
the third component such as a crystalline compound or<br>
the like that is insoluble or hard to be soluble in<br>
water but soluble in an organic solvent, by granulating<br>
and drying the mixture using water or a water soluble<br>
organic solvent and then extracting/removing the third<br>
component with an organic solvent. The porous<br>
cellulose particles described in this document is<br>
entirely different from the porous cellulose aggregates<br>
of the present invention in the particle structure,<br>
because the primary cellulose particles form such a<br>
homogeneous continuous film-like tight strong cellulose<br>
wall structure that the boundaries of the particles<br>
become unclear. Although the cellulose particle in<br>
Patent Document 2 is superior in its fluidity, the<br>
tight continuous cellulose wall is impermeable to<br>
water, so that the cellulose particle was not<br>
disintegrated in water, and sometimes the rapid release<br>
of an active ingredient was impeded. Further, the<br>
cellulose particle of Patent Document 2 is poor in its<br>
plastic deformation and has insufficient compactibility<br>
while the cellulose is compressed, and furthermore<br>
since an organic solvent and a third component, which<br>
is a crystalline compound soluble in the organic<br>
solvent, are used during the production process, not<br>
only the production cost is high but also the active<br>
ingredient can be inactivated. Thus it is insufficient<br>
to be used stably as an excipient.<br>
[0004]<br><br>
Patent Document 3 describes porous micro-<br>
cellulose particles (corresponding to Comparative<br>
Example 7 of the present application) having a porous<br>
structure with crystal structure type I, a specific<br>
surface area of 20 m2/g of above and a pore volume of<br>
0.3 cm3 or above for pores with diameter 0.01 µm or<br>
larger, and having an average particle size of at most<br>
100 µm, obtained by granulating and drying fine<br>
particle natural cellulose dispersed in an organic<br>
solvent using spray-dry method. These micro-cellulose<br>
particles also have the aforementioned cellulose wall<br>
structure and are entirely different from the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention in the<br>
particle structure. Further, the pore volume itself of<br>
the cellulose particles of Patent Document 3 is large,<br>
but since the particle structure is different from that<br>
of the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention, water permeation into the particles is<br>
difficult, and there is a problem of the inferior<br>
disintegration property. In addition, since an organic<br>
solvent is used for these porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles during the production process, not only is<br>
the production cost high but also the active ingredient<br>
can be inactivated because the specific surface area is<br>
too large and the interaction between the active<br>
ingredient and water is promoted. Thus it is<br>
insufficient to be used stably as an excipient.<br>
[0005]<br><br>
Patent Document 4 describes cellulose powder<br>
(corresponding to Comparative Example 8 of the present<br>
application) having an average degree of polymerization<br>
of 150-375, apparent specific volume of 1.84-8.92 cm3/g,<br>
a particle size of 300 µm or less as cellulose powder<br>
having a good compactibility and disintegration<br>
property .<br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Document 5 describes micro-crystalline<br>
cellulose aggregates (corresponding to Comparative<br>
Example 9 of the present application) having an average<br>
degree of polymerization of 60-375, apparent specific<br>
volume of 1.6-3.1 cm3/g, apparent tapping specific<br>
volume of 1.4 cm3/g or above, a repose angle of 35-42°,<br>
and containing 2-80% by weight of component of 200 mesh<br>
or above. The cellulose powder obtained according to<br>
Examples of these Patent Documents has a small<br>
intraparticular pore volume according to the<br>
measurement result of pore distribution using mercury<br>
porosimetry and the pore structure is entirely<br>
different from that of the present invention which is<br>
formed intentionally. For that reason, these cellulose<br>
powders have a small specific surface area of 0.6-1.2<br>
cm3 and poor compactibility. These publications<br>
disclose the control of the compactibility, fluidity<br>
and disintegration property of cellulose particles by<br>
adjusting the apparent specific volume, but there were<br>
problems that in the range of relatively small apparent<br><br>
specific volume of 2-0-2.9 cm3/g, the fluidity and<br>
disintegration property were good but the<br>
compactibility was unsatisfactory, while with larger<br>
apparent specific volume of 3.0-3.2 cm3/g, the<br>
compactibility was good but the fluidity and<br>
disintegration property were poor.<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 6 describes β-1, 4-glucan<br>
powder (corresponding to Comparative Example 1 of the<br>
present application) as cellulose powder having good<br>
compactibility having an average particle size of at<br>
most 30 µm and a specific surface area of 1.3 m2/g. The<br>
(3-1, 4-glucan powder described in the document does not<br>
have the secondary aggregate structure, and individual<br>
primary particles exist singly. Although this glucan<br>
powder has good compactibility, it has problems that<br>
the disintegration property is poor and the fluidity is<br>
inferior due to the small average particle size.<br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Document 7 describes a cellulose<br>
powder (corresponding to Comparative Example 10 of the<br>
present application) having an average degree of<br>
polymerization of 100-375, an acetic acid retention<br>
rate of 280% or above, Kawakita formula (P*V0/(V0-<br>
V)=1/a*b + P/a) wherein a is 0.85-0.90, b is 0.05-0.10,<br>
an apparent specific volume of 4.0-6.0 cm3/g,<br>
substantially no particles of 355 µm or larger, and an<br>
average particle size of 30-120 µm as a cellulose<br><br>
powder having good compactibility and disintegration<br>
property obtained by hydrolyzing a cellulose-like<br>
substance. The cellulose powder obtained by the method<br>
of Example described in that document has also a small<br>
pore volume within a particle according to the<br>
measurement result of pore distribution using the<br>
mercury porosimetry and thus the pore structure is<br>
entirely different from the intentionally formed pore<br>
structure of the present invention. Although the<br>
cellulose powder of Patent Document 7 is described to<br>
have good compression compactibility and disintegration<br>
property, the best balanced Example that is disclosed<br>
specifically is measured to have a repose angle of over<br>
55° and the fluidity is not satisfactory enough. There<br>
was a problem that in formulations, in which an active<br>
ingredient having poor fluidity was used in large<br>
proportion, the variation coefficient of tablet weight<br>
was larger thereby influencing uniformity of the drug<br>
content. Further, when compacting (molding) was<br>
performed under high pressure using the cellulose<br>
powder according to the document, a high hardness can<br>
be obtained but there was a problem of delayed<br>
disintegration because there is no intentionally formed<br>
intraparticular pore, and water permeability to inside<br>
of the particle was low.<br>
[0009]<br>
Patent Document 8 describes a crystalline<br>
cellulose (corresponding to Comparative Example of 11<br><br>
of the present application) as the cellulose powder<br>
having good compactibility, disintegration property and<br>
fluidity, which has an average degree of polymerization<br>
of 100-375, and in which the particles that pass<br>
through a 75 µm sieve and are retained on a 38 µm sieve<br>
occupy 70% or more of the total weight, and an average<br>
major axis and minor axis ratio of the particles is 2.0<br>
or higher.<br>
[0010]<br>
Patent Document 9 describes a cellulose<br>
powder (corresponding to Comparative Example of 2-4 of<br>
the present application) as the cellulose having good<br>
compactibility, disintegration property and fluidity,<br>
having an average degree of polymerization of 150-450,<br>
an average L/D (ratio of major axis/minor axis) of 2.0-<br>
4.5 for particles of 75 µm or less, an average particle<br>
size of 20-250 µm, an apparent specific volume of 4.0-<br>
7.0 cm3/g, and a repose angle of 54° or less and a<br>
specific surface area of 0.5-4 m2/g. Since the pore<br>
volume within a particle of the cellulose powders<br>
described in these publications, similar to the cases<br>
described above, measured by the mercury porosimetry is<br>
small, the cellulose have entirely different pore<br>
structure from the intentionally formed pore structure<br>
of the present invention. The cellulose powders<br>
described in these publications give a high hardness to<br>
a molded body by elongating the shape of particles, but<br>
because they have an elongated shape, the apparent<br><br>
specific volume becomes larger, and the higher the<br>
compactibility, the fluidity decreases. Among the<br>
cellulose powders in Examples described in these<br>
publications, the one having the best fluidity was<br>
measured to have a repose angle of 44°. For example,<br>
when continuous compression was performed at high speed<br>
in a formulation in which an active ingredient having<br>
poor fluidity was mixed in a large proportion, the<br>
variation coefficient of tablet weight was getting<br>
larger, thereby influencing uniformity of the drug<br>
content, and thus satisfactory result was not obtained<br>
in terms of fluidity. Further, when compacting<br>
(molding) was performed under high pressure using the<br>
cellulose powder according to these publications, high<br>
hardness can be achieved but there was a problem of<br>
delayed disintegration because there was no<br>
intentionally formed intraparticular pore, and water<br>
permeability to the inside of particle was low.<br>
[0011]<br>
Patent Document 10 describes a cellulose<br>
powder (corresponding to Comparative Example 14 of the<br>
present application) having an average degree of<br>
polymerization of 150-450, an average particle size 30-<br>
250 µm, an apparent specific volume of over 7 cm3/g and<br>
a holding capacity of polyethylene glycol with a<br>
molecular weight of 400 of 190% or more. The cellulose<br>
powder of this document does not hold a secondary<br>
aggregate structure, and primary cellulose particles<br><br>
exist substantially as a singlet. Also, the<br>
intraparticular pore volume measured by the mercury<br>
porositometry is small and the cellulose powder has an<br>
entirely different pore structure from the<br>
intentionally formed pore structure of the present<br>
invention. Further, when the apparent specific volume<br>
is large, the fluidity is greatly impaired, and the<br>
repose angle of the best cellulose powder in terms of<br>
fluidity according to this document was measured to be<br>
50°. For example, when continuous compacting (molding)<br>
was performed at high speed in a formulation in which<br>
an active ingredient having poor fluidity was mixed in<br>
a large proportion, the variation coefficient of tablet<br>
weight was increased, thereby influencing uniformity of<br>
the drug content, and thus satisfactory result was not<br>
obtained in terms of fluidity. Further, when<br>
compacting (molding) was performed under high pressure<br>
using the cellulose powder according to the document,<br>
high hardness can be achieved but there was a problem<br>
of delayed disintegration because there was no<br>
intentionally formed intraparticular pores, and water<br>
permeability to the inside of particle was low.<br>
In addition, the average particle size of the<br>
dispersed cellulose particles in the cellulose<br>
dispersion must be 50 µm or larger to increase the<br>
apparent specific volume, but the average particle size<br>
of the dispersed cellulose particles of the present<br>
invention is obtained at 10 µm or larger and less than<br><br>
50 µm, which is, quite different in terms of the<br>
production method.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the range of 2.3-6.4 cm3/g of the apparent<br>
specific volume for the cellulose powders described in<br>
these Patent Documents 6-9, and in the range of over 7<br>
cm3/g of the apparent specific volume for the cellulose<br>
powders described in Patent Document 10, sufficient<br>
compactibility was obtained in each case but there was<br>
a problem that the fluidity and disintegration property<br>
were deteriorated.<br>
[0013]<br>
Patent Document 11 describes<br>
pharmacologically inert round shaped seed core<br>
containing 10-70% of a crystalline cellulose having an<br>
average degree of polymerization of 60-375 and 10-90%<br>
of a water soluble additive as cellulose particles<br>
having good fluidity. Further, Patent Document 12<br>
describes a pharmacologically inert round shaped seed<br>
core (corresponding to Comparative Example 12 of the<br>
present application) containing 50% or more of a<br>
crystalline cellulose having a water absorbing capacity<br>
of 0.5-1.5 ml/g, roundness of 0.7 or higher, an<br>
apparent tapping specific volume of 0.65 g/ml or<br>
higher, a friability of 1% or less and an average<br>
degree of polymerization of 60-375, wherein distilled<br>
water is added to powder containing crystalline<br>
cellulose at 50% or more while mixing using a mixer<br><br>
granulator and kneaded to prepare the round shaped seed<br>
core. Patent Document 13 describes microcrystalline<br>
cellulose particles having a loose bulk density of at<br>
least 0.4 g/cm3 (2.5 cm3/g in apparent specific volume),<br>
spherical shape, an average particle size of 2-35 µm<br>
and a smooth surface, wherein the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose particles is prepared by mechanically<br>
reducing the particle size of hydrolyzed cellulose<br>
particles and by spray-drying. Patent Document 14<br>
describes cellulose system particles (corresponding to<br>
Comparative Example 13 of the present application)<br>
containing 10% or more of the crystalline cellulose<br>
having an average degree of polymerization of 60-350,<br>
and having an apparent tapping specific volume of 0.60-<br>
0.95 g/ml, roundness of 0.7 or higher, a shape<br>
coefficient of 1.10-1.50, and an average particle size<br>
of 10-400 µm, wherein the crystalline cellulose is<br>
obtained by hydrolyzing a cellulose material to an<br>
average degree of polymerization of 60-350, then<br>
grinding the result mechanically to the average<br>
particle size of 15 urn, and then drying the dispersion<br>
containing thus obtained crystalline cellulose in a<br>
shape of liquid droplets.<br>
[0014]<br>
The cellulose particles described in these<br>
documents do not form a secondary aggregate structure,<br>
and the celluloses obtained by the method of Examples<br>
described in Patent Documents have an apparent specific<br><br>
volume of 2.5 cm3/g or lower, nearly spherical shape and<br>
good fluidity but are poor in compression<br>
compactibility, and under the commonly used compression<br>
pressure of 10-20 MPa, a molded body which has<br>
sufficient hardness for practical use can not be made.<br>
As described above, for cellulose particles<br>
of conventional arts, compactibility, fluidity and<br>
disintegration property have been mutually<br>
contradictory characteristics, and it has been hoped to<br>
obtain cellulose particles having these characteristics<br>
in good balance.<br>
[0015]<br>
On the other hand, since the cellulose<br>
particles described in Patent Documents 4-9, and 11-14<br>
do not have intraparticular pores that are<br>
intentionally formed, and pore volume within a particle<br>
is small, almost no active ingredient can be held in<br>
the particles and therefore there have been problems of<br>
liquid components bleeding out in compression<br>
compacting (molding) and problems in tablet press<br>
operation. Also, the cellulose particles described in<br>
Patent Document 2 and 3 have intraparticular pores, but<br>
the pore diameter is small, and therefore it is<br>
difficult for water to permeate into the dense and<br>
continuous cellulose wall, which imposes problems that<br>
the cellulose particle does not disintegrate in water<br>
and quick release of an active ingredient is hindered.<br>
The cellulose particles described in Patent Document 10<br><br>
has an apparent specific volume that is too big, and<br>
especially in high speed compression compacting<br>
(molding) they sometimes cannot be practically used<br>
because of the their fluidity and disintegration<br>
property.<br>
[0016]<br>
Furthermore, since these cellulose particles<br>
do not have intraparticular pores that are<br>
intentionally formed, and the pore volume within a<br>
particle is small, almost no active ingredient can be<br>
held in the particles, and thus they have a shortcoming<br>
that in solid formulation of an active ingredient that<br>
is hard to be soluble in water, the formulation can not<br>
be practically used due to slow elution of the active<br>
ingredient, unless complicated processes are performed<br>
such as temporary granulation with water or an organic<br>
solvent, drying and the like. They also have a<br>
shortcoming that in solid formulation of an active<br>
ingredient that tends to sublimate, the active<br>
ingredient re-crystallizes during storage, ruining<br>
their commercial value.<br>
[0017]<br>
The active ingredient in a solid formulation<br>
for oral administration is eluted from the formulation<br>
to the body fluid in the digestive tract, absorbed from<br>
the digestive tract, enters into the blood circulation<br>
and expresses the drug effect. Since the active<br>
ingredient that is hard to be soluble in water is<br><br>
poorly eluted, sometimes it is excreted out of the body<br>
before all the administered active ingredient is eluted<br>
and full effect is not expressed. The ratio of the<br>
total amount of active ingredient entering into the<br>
blood circulation to the administered amount of active<br>
ingredient is generally known as bioavailability, and<br>
to improve bioavailability and the rapid action of<br>
active ingredient, various methods have been<br>
investigated up until now for improving the elution of<br>
hardly-soluble active ingredients.<br>
[0018]<br>
Patent Document 15 describes a method for<br>
grinding an active ingredient that is hard to be<br>
soluble in water and β-1,4-glucan powder together.<br>
This method needs a long time for grinding treatment<br>
until crystalline characteristics of β-1,4-glucan<br>
powder are lost, and also powerful shear must be<br>
applied continuously for a long time using a roll<br>
mixer, thus creating a problem of poor efficiency in<br>
the actual production process. Further, β-1,4-glucan<br>
powder that has lost the crystalline characteristics<br>
has a problem of poor compression compactibility.<br>
[0019]<br>
For a solid formulation for oral<br>
administration prepared by the direct press method from<br>
a main drug that is hard to be soluble in water, Patent<br>
Document 16 describes a method for increasing the<br>
disintegration of the tablet and the rate of elution of<br><br>
the main drug by increasing the hardness of the tablet<br>
and decreasing the variation of the main drug content<br>
by adding β-1, 4-glucan, a disintegrator and a<br>
surfactant. This document describes no intraparticular<br>
pores, and it is not known at all to improve water<br>
solubility of a drug by mixing an active ingredient<br>
that is hard to be soluble in water and a porous<br>
cellulose aggregate. Furthermore, since a surfactant<br>
has to be added to facilitate the elution of the active<br>
ingredient that is hard to be soluble in water, there<br>
is a problem that when this solid formulation was<br>
administered, the surfactant caused inflammation of the<br>
mucus membrane of the digestive tract.<br>
[0020]<br>
Further, Patent Document 17 describes that<br>
when tablets are produced by the wet press method using<br>
a main drug that is hard to be soluble in water and β-<br>
1,4-glucan through the steps of powder mixing,<br>
kneading, granulation and drying, tablets having a high<br>
tablet hardness, a short disintegration time and a fast<br>
elution rate of the main drug can be produced by adding<br>
a water soluble polymer solution. Also, this document<br>
describes no porous cellulose particle having large<br>
intraparticular pores, and it is not known at all to<br>
improve water solubility of a drug by mixing an active<br>
ingredient that is hard to be soluble in water and a<br>
porous cellulose aggregate. Still further in such a<br>
method, many steps are essential for drying and there<br><br>
are problems of the cost related to the equipment, and<br>
that the energy cost for drying is high. Also, there<br>
are problems that this method cannot be applied to an<br>
active ingredient inactivated by heat and the like<br>
problems.<br>
[0021]<br>
Patent Document 18 describes a method for<br>
improving the elution of a drug by mixing a hardly-<br>
soluble drug with porous structured cellulose particles<br>
having a particular specific surface area and a pore<br>
volume, which is obtained by granulating and drying<br>
fine particle like natural cellulose dispersed in an<br>
organic solvent by the spray dry method, and absorbing<br>
thereto by sublimation. Since the porous cellulose<br>
particles described in that document have a high<br>
specific surface area and a large pore volume within a<br>
particle, the improvement of elution is sure to be<br>
observed when the hardly-soluble active ingredient is<br>
absorbed by sublimation. However, Example of this<br>
Patent Document uses cellulose particles having<br>
excessively high specific surface area and the active<br>
ingredient absorbed on the surface by sublimation is<br>
amorphous and therefore there is a problem of storage<br>
stability because during the storage a part of the<br>
active ingredient is crystallized and the elution rate<br>
is changed, and in a tightly bound compacting<br>
composition such as a tablet, there is a shortcoming<br>
that the elution of the active ingredient is slow<br><br>
because its disintegration is impeded due to the poor<br>
disintegration property.<br>
[0022]<br>
A sublimatable active ingredient has a<br>
problem of bleeding out of a solid formulation during<br>
storage, and to prevent this from happening, many of<br>
these solid formulations are film coated or sugar<br>
coated. However, even with such treatments, there are<br>
problems that the active ingredient bleeding out of the<br>
formulation through the film layer causes low<br>
uniformity of the active ingredient content in the<br>
formulation, the active ingredient attached to the<br>
surface of the formulation gives irritating smell when<br>
taking the formulation or re-crystallizing in a<br>
preserving container such as a vial greatly reduces the<br>
commercial value. When the coating treatment is not<br>
performed on the formulation, the sublimation-re-<br>
crystallization is more pronounced than when the<br>
coating treatment is performed.<br>
[0023]<br>
As already described above, in Patent<br>
Document 18 cellulose particles having excessively high<br>
specific surface area was used, and since the active<br>
ingredient absorbed by sublimation on the surface was<br>
amorphous, there was a problem of poor storage<br>
stability of the active ingredient, and in a tightly<br>
bound compacting composition such as a tablet, there<br>
was a shortcoming that the elution of the active<br><br>
ingredient was slow because its disintegration was<br>
impeded due to the poor disintegration property.<br>
[0024]<br>
Also, as a method for preventing the re-<br>
crystallization caused by sublimation of ibuprofen in<br>
solid formulation, Patent Document 19 describes a<br>
method for preserving ibuprofen containing solid<br>
formulation together with 1 or plurality of stabilizers<br>
selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, magnesium oxide and sodium bicarbonate in<br>
a closed container such as a vial. Using this method<br>
the deposition of crystals to the original closed<br>
container that has preserved the formulation and the<br>
irritating smell of the formulation are surely<br>
improved, but polyvinyl pyrrolidone, magnesium oxide,<br>
sodium carbonate and the like have to be placed in the<br>
container as separate formulations, making the process<br>
more complicated, and thus this is entirely different<br>
from a single formulation which is made sublimation-<br>
proof by adding to the formulation a porous cellulose<br>
such as the formulation of the present invention<br>
containing a sublimatable active ingredient.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the past, a composition containing an<br>
active ingredient that was oily, liquid or semi solid<br>
at normal temperature had problems compared to a solid<br>
active ingredient that it is especially prone to tablet<br>
pressing problems due to the liquid component bleeding<br><br>
out from the formulation, spots of the liquid component<br>
are produced on the surface of the formulation, and in<br>
the case of granular formulation, inferior fluidity<br>
occurred. These problems not only markedly lower the<br>
quality of the product but also cause the low<br>
uniformity of the concentration and effect of the<br>
active ingredient, and thus improving these problems is<br>
a very important task.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the production of tablets, Patent Document<br>
20-31 describe a method for retaining an active<br>
ingredient that is liquid/semi solid at normal<br>
temperature to an absorption carrier as it is, or<br>
holding an active ingredient dissolved, emulsified or<br>
suspended in water, organic solvent, oil, aqueous<br>
polymer or surfactant to an absorption carrier, and<br>
then compression compacting dried powder or granules<br>
obtained after a drying step. However, by the methods<br>
of these Patent Documents, the active ingredient that<br>
is liquid or semisolid at normal temperature effuses<br>
out at the time of compression, causing tablet pressing<br>
troubles, and sometimes satisfactory compression molded<br>
body may not be obtained. Also, for cellulose<br>
particles these Patent Documents do not describe a pore<br>
volume within a particle, and it is not known that when<br>
the active ingredient that is liquid or semisolid at<br>
room temperature is compressed, the addition of the<br>
porous cellulose particles of the present invention<br><br>
having a large pore volume within a particle prevents<br>
bleeding out by the porous cellulose aggregate holding<br>
the active ingredient that is liquid or semisolid<br>
inside of the particles and makes preparation of solid<br>
formulations such as powder, granules, tablets and the<br>
like easier. Still further, in the method described in<br>
Patent Document 20-31 many steps are essential for<br>
drying and there are problems that the cost related to<br>
the equipment, and the energy cost for drying is high.<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0031]<br>
Since the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention is superior in compactibility,<br>
fluidity and disintegration property, in using the<br>
porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention as<br>
an excipient in production of a molded body containing<br>
various active ingredients, a molded body having a good<br>
homogeneous miscibility with an active ingredient, no<br>
variation of weight, a good uniformity in active<br>
ingredient content, a sufficient hardness, no tablet<br>
press problems, low friability loss and a good<br>
disintegration property can be provided by a simple<br>
method.<br>
[0032]<br>
Since the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention greatly enhances elution tablet<br>
pressing and disintegration property of the active<br>
ingredient in a solid formulation containing an active<br>
ingredient which is hard to be soluble in water , it is<br>
especially useful as an excipient for the solid<br>
formulation. Further, since the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention prevents the<br><br>
effusion of a liquid or semi-solid active ingredient<br>
and improves disintegration property in a solid<br>
formulation containing the liquid or semi-solid active<br>
ingredient, it is especially useful as an excipient for<br>
the solid formulation. In addition, in mixing of the<br>
active ingredient and components other than the active<br>
ingredient or in a solid formulation using thereof,<br>
when an active ingredient exists in a minute amount,<br>
and in particular when the average particle size of the<br>
active ingredient is small and the attachment<br>
aggregation characteristic is high, the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention can<br>
contribute to a mixing rate of an active ingredient and<br>
to a reduction of the variation of concentration, and<br>
improves tablet pressing and disintegration property,<br>
and thus it is especially useful as an excipient for<br>
the solid formulation. Still further, the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention can<br>
prevent recrystallization by a sublimation of a<br>
sublimatable active ingredient in a solid formulation<br>
of the sublimatable active ingredient and prevent a<br>
reduction of the market value, and thus it is<br>
especially useful as an excipient for the solid<br>
formulation.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0033]<br>
The present invention will be described<br>
particularly centered around the preferred mode as<br>
follows.<br><br>
The porous cellulose aggregate of the present<br>
invention must have a secondary aggregate structure<br>
composed of aggregated primary particles. This is the<br>
secondary aggregate structure having clear boundaries<br>
of the primary particles when the surface of the<br>
particles is observed at a magnification of x250 or<br>
xl500 by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The<br>
secondary aggregate structure formed by the aggregation<br>
of the primary particles is closely related to<br>
disintegration property, and the structure without this<br>
particular structure is not preferable because the<br>
disintegration property is deteriorated. When the<br>
boundaries of the primary particles are not clear, for<br>
example having the dense and continuous cellulose<br>
septa, it is not preferable because the particles do<br>
not disintegrate in water and the disintegration<br>
property of a molded body becomes also poor due to the<br>
densely continued and tightly bound primary cellulose<br>
particles.<br>
[0034]<br>
Further, the secondary aggregate structure<br>
formed by the aggregation of the primary particles is<br>
also closely related to not only disintegration<br>
property but also elution of an active ingredient.<br>
Water permeability to the porous cellulose particles<br>
having the secondary aggregate structure formed by the<br>
aggregation of the primary particles is fast, and<br>
disintegration of the primary particles are<br><br>
accelerated, and when an active ingredient is retained,<br>
the elution of the active ingredient which is hard to<br>
be soluble in water is effectively improved because the<br>
contact area between the active ingredient and water is<br>
increased.<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition, this secondary aggregate<br>
structure is homogeneously distributed whether in the<br>
inside or on the surface of the particles, and is<br>
preferred because, when the secondary aggregate<br>
structure is mixed with an active ingredient, the<br>
active ingredient can be retained between gaps of the<br>
primary cellulose particles and in particular, effusion<br>
of the liquid component can be prevented.<br>
Still further, this secondary aggregate<br>
structure is preferred because it allows retention of<br>
the active ingredient not only on the surface but also<br>
inside of the particles, and therefore it contributes<br>
to the improvement of the mixing rate of the active<br>
ingredient and mixing uniformity, and can greatly<br>
reduce the variation of the concentration.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention the intraparticular pore volume must<br>
be 0.265 cm3/g-2.625 cm3/g. Porous particles having a<br>
large intraparticular pore volume are superior in<br>
plastic deformability, and since the particles tend to<br>
collapse on compression, they are superior in<br><br>
compactibility. The porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention is derived originally from cellulose<br>
in which the pore volume of the aggregated particles is<br>
intentionally enlarged, and thus the plastic<br>
deformability is increased by changing the structure of<br>
the particles themselves. For that reason the<br>
particles express high compression compactibility<br>
irrespective of the apparent specific volume of the<br>
particles. When the intraparticular pore volume is<br>
less than 0.265 cm3/g, the primary cellulose particles<br>
have only the intraparticular pores that the primary<br>
cellulose particles originally have or that are formed<br>
naturally on aggregating cellulose, not intentionally<br>
formed, and thus they are poor in plastic<br>
deformability. To improve the compactibility, the<br>
apparent specific volume of the particles must be<br>
larger, resulting in poor fluidity. The porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention can keep a<br>
good compactibility with a relatively small apparent<br>
specific volume, and as a result the aggregate having<br>
also a superior fluidity can be obtained.<br>
[0037]<br>
When the intraparticular pore volume is 0.265<br>
cm3 or larger, sufficient pore volume is present in the<br>
particles, and an active ingredient, which is once<br>
incorporated in the pores on the surface of the<br>
particles during the mixing process and compression<br>
process, is not released easily, and thus these<br><br>
particles are preferred because sufficient amount of<br>
the liquid component can be retained in the<br>
intraparticular pores, and the effusion can be<br>
prevented. When a solid active ingredient is used, the<br>
finely ground active ingredient can be retained<br>
homogeneously and in large amount to improve water<br>
dispersion and elution, and the recrystallization of<br>
sublimatable active ingredient is prevented, especially<br>
the recrystallization during storage is prevented, and<br>
thus these particles are preferred because they can<br>
contribute to the stabilization and prevention of<br>
degeneration of the commercial value, and further they<br>
are preferred because they can contribute to the<br>
improvement of a mixing rate and mixing uniformity of<br>
the active ingredient and can reduce the variation of<br>
the concentration greatly.<br>
[0038]<br>
When an active ingredient which is hard to be<br>
soluble in water is used by dissolving temporally,<br>
suspending or emulsifying, they are preferred because<br>
they are superior in retaining a liquid component. A<br>
drug concentration variation coefficient that is an<br>
index of the variation of the concentration of an<br>
active ingredient is preferably not over 3.0% during<br>
the mixing period, more preferably 2.0% or less, and<br>
especially preferably 1.5% or less. Especially when an<br>
active ingredient that has an average particle size of<br>
10 µm or less and has extremely high aggregatability is<br><br>
mixed with cellulose particles having the<br>
intraparticular pore volume of 0.265 cmVg or higher<br>
such as the porous cellulose aggregate of the present<br>
invention, it is preferred because the active<br>
ingredient is retained not only on the surface of the<br>
particles but also inside of the particles and thus the<br>
drug concentration variable coefficient can be 2.0% or<br>
less.<br>
[0039]<br>
When the intraparticular pore volume is less<br>
than 0.2 65 cm3/g, the effect described above can not be<br>
obtained because the dispersion uniformity and<br>
retention capacity of a solid or liquid active<br>
ingredient are impaired, causing variation of the<br>
concentration of the active ingredient, aggregation of<br>
solid formulation, poor compression compactibility,<br>
recrystallization of sublimative active ingredients<br>
during storage and lowering of the stability and<br>
commercial value, and therefore it is not preferred.<br>
The larger the intraparticular pore volume<br>
is, the better, but the pore volume that a particle can<br>
have is limited and is at most 2.625 cm3/g.<br>
Furthermore, if the pore volume exceeds 2.625<br>
cm3/g, it is not preferred because the apparent specific<br>
volume is increased and the fluidity is decreased.<br>
As described above, the larger the<br>
intraparticular pore volume, the more it is preferred<br>
because the compactibility is higher due to the<br><br>
particle having plastic deformability, the active<br>
ingredient is incorporated inside, improving the<br>
elution, the ground active ingredient is retained in a<br>
large quantity, recrystallization of the sublimative<br>
component can be prevented, the mixing rate of the<br>
active ingredient is increased, the mixing uniformity<br>
is improved, the liquid component can be retained and<br>
the like, but when the intraparticular pore volume is<br>
too large, the apparent specific volume tends to be<br>
increased and the fluidity is decreased and therefore<br>
the preferred range of the intraparticular pore volume<br>
where the compactibility and fluidity are in good<br>
balance is 0.265 cm3/g-1.500 cmVg, and especially<br>
preferred range is 0.265 cm3/g-l.000 cm3/g.<br>
[0040]<br>
The distribution of pore diameter of the<br>
porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention is<br>
measured, for example, by mercury porosimetry. It is<br>
preferred that a clear peak is identified especially in<br>
the range of 0.1-10 µm. Further, the median pore<br>
diameter that is a peak top of the pore distribution is<br>
closely related to water permeability into the<br>
particle, and is preferably 0.3 µm or larger. Water<br>
permeability becomes larger when the median pore<br>
diameter is 0.3 µm or larger, and the disintegration<br>
property is improved further. The larger the median<br>
pore diameter the more preferable, but it is at most in<br>
the range of 10-15 µm.<br><br>
In the production method according to Patent<br>
Document 1, two or more groups of primary cellulose<br>
particles having different average particle size were<br>
mixed and dried, and thus the packing among the<br>
particles was too good and it was difficult to obtain<br>
the pore diameter substantially of 3 µm or larger. The<br>
present invention is especially superior in the balance<br>
of the compactibility and disintegration property, and<br>
the preferred median pore diameter is 3-15 µm and more<br>
preferred is 3-10 µm.<br>
[0041]<br>
The crystalline structure of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention must be<br>
the type I. The crystalline structure of cellulose,<br>
type I, II, III, IV and the like are known, and among<br>
them type I and type II are called as "natural<br>
cellulose" and "regenerated cellulose", respectively<br>
and are used in general, but type III and IV are<br>
obtained in laboratory scale only and not generally<br>
used in industrial scale. Natural cellulose has been<br>
consumed as a plant fiber foodstuff from ancient times<br>
and is widely used at present as a dispersion<br>
stabilizer for liquid foodstuffs and an excipient for<br>
pharmaceutical products. On the other hand,<br>
regenerated cellulose is a product of the altered<br>
crystalline structure which is regenerated by removing<br>
solvents and the cellulose solution of a chemical such<br>
as carbon disulfide, sodium hydroxide or the like, and<br><br>
some of them are used as a compacting agent for<br>
foodstuffs in a wet processing. The regenerated<br>
cellulose of type II crystalline structure is not<br>
preferred, because with altered crystalline structure<br>
from natural cellulose of type I crystalline structure,<br>
the particles become stiff, have decreased plastic<br>
deformability on compression and cannot give a<br>
sufficient hardness to the molded bodies.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention, the average particle size must be<br>
over 30 µm and 250 µm or less. When the average<br>
particle size is 30 µm or less, cellulose particles<br>
aggregate each other, the active ingredient is not<br>
diffused homogeneously in mixing with the active<br>
ingredient, the variation of the active ingredient<br>
tends to be greater in the molded body obtained, and<br>
the variation of the weight of the molded body in the<br>
continuous production also tends to be greater.<br>
Further, when the average particle size is over 250 µm,<br>
separation and segregation tend to occur in continuous<br>
compression of a powder formulation mixed with an<br>
active ingredient having poor fluidity.<br>
[0043]<br>
The specific surface area of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention must be<br>
0.1 m2/g or larger and less than 20 m2/g. At the<br>
specific surface area less than 0.1 m2/g, the<br><br>
compression compactibility is lower, and it is<br>
difficult to give a molded body high hardness and low<br>
friability. Further, when the specific surface area is<br>
over 20 m2/g, it is not preferable to mix an active<br>
ingredient that tends to be inactivated by cellulose,<br>
because the contact area between cellulose and the<br>
active ingredient is excessively too large, and the<br>
active ingredient tends to lose activity.<br>
[0044]<br>
The repose angle of the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention must be 25° or larger<br>
and less than 44°. Normally, an active ingredient is<br>
prepared so that when administered, it diffuses in<br>
gastric juice and intestinal juice media and enhances<br>
drug effect rapidly, and for that reason it is often<br>
grounded or is fine powder from the beginning. Since<br>
it is fine powder, the fluidity is poor, and at the<br>
repose angle of 44° or larger, it is not preferred for<br>
the fluidity of the mixed powder when a large amount of<br>
an active ingredient having poor fluidity is mixed.<br>
Especially, there is tendency of the variation of the<br>
weight of the molded bodies at high speed tablet<br>
pressing at a speed of several ten thousands-several<br>
hundred thousands tablets/hour. The fluidity is better<br>
with the smaller repose angle and the repose angle of<br>
25°-42° is especially good. More preferable is a repose<br>
angle of 25°-40°. The repose angle of less than 25° is<br>
not preferable for separation and segregation of the<br><br>
active ingredient.<br>
The porous cellulose aggregate of the present<br>
invention must have a swelling rate of 5% or larger,<br>
preferably of 6-50%, especially preferably of 7-30%.<br>
The swelling degree can be measured as follows. From<br>
the volume (Vi) of about 10 g of a powder slowly poured<br>
into a cylindrical container having a volume of 100 cm3,<br>
and the volume (V2) after standing for 8 hours after<br>
adding about 50 cm3 of pure water to the powder layer<br>
and mixing so that the powder is completely wet, using<br>
following formula the swelling degree is obtained.<br>
Swelling degree (%) = (V2 - V1)/V1 x 100<br>
Swelling degree is a gap between the primary<br>
cellulose particles created when the primary cellulose<br>
particles are aggregated by drying, and the larger is<br>
the value, the easier to disintegrate due to elevated<br>
water permeability into the particles. In the<br>
conventional cellulose powder, the one having a high<br>
compactibility has to reduce the swelling degree<br>
resulting in sometimes insufficient disintegration<br>
property, and for the other having a high fluidity,<br>
although the swelling degree is high and the<br>
disintegration property is good, it is difficult to<br>
have a high level of compactibility. Among the<br>
conventional cellulose powder, the one having the best<br>
balance for compactibility and disintegration property<br><br>
is the porous cellulose aggregate of Patent Document 1.<br>
There is no description of the swelling degree in that<br>
document, but the measurement of the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate according to Example described in that Patent<br>
Document revealed that the higher the compactibility,<br>
the lower the value of the swelling degree, and it was<br>
4% at most. So far it has not been achieved to<br>
increase compactibility while maintaining<br>
disintegration property by keeping swelling degree at<br>
high level, and the present invention has achieved this<br>
for the first time.<br>
[0045]<br>
The apparent specific volume of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention is<br>
preferably 2.0-6.0 cm3/g. The porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention has hardness,<br>
fluidity and disintegration property in a good balance<br>
in almost whole part of the apparent specific volume<br>
compared to the conventional one because of the porous<br>
structure. To obtain a high compression<br>
compactibility, the apparent specific volume is<br>
preferably 2.0 cmVg or larger, and to obtain a higher<br>
fluidity the apparent specific volume is preferable 6.0<br>
cm3/g or less. Especially preferred apparent specific<br>
volume is 2.5-5.0 cm /g.<br>
[0046]<br>
For the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention, cylindrical molded bodies, obtained<br><br>
by weighing 0.5 g of the cellulose powder, placing it<br>
in a die (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, Material SUS2, 3 were<br>
used), compressing with a circular flat punch with a<br>
diameter of 1.1 cm (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, Material<br>
SUS2, 3 were used) until the pressure of 10 MPa and 20<br>
MPa was attained (AIKOH ENGINEERING CO., LTD. PCM-1A<br>
was used. The compression rate was 1 cm/minute), and<br>
holding at the target pressure for 10 seconds, have<br>
preferably the hardness of 60 N or higher and 165 N or<br>
higher, respectively. If the hardness of 10 MPa is<br>
less than 60 N and the hardness of 20 MPa is less than<br>
165 N under each condition, the molded bodies<br>
containing a large amount of an active ingredient<br>
produced at the rate of several ten thousands - several<br>
hundred thousands tablets/hour have a low hardness,<br>
tablet pressing problem such as friability, capping<br>
tend to occur. The tablet hardness shown here is<br>
higher the better, but the hardness of 10 MPa and 20<br>
MPa products are 160 N and 450 N, respectively, at<br>
most.<br>
[0047]<br>
When the aforementioned cylindrical molded<br>
body obtained by compressing to a pressure of 10 MPa<br>
has hardness of 70-160 N, or the one obtained by<br>
compressing to 20 MPa has hardness of 170-410 N and a<br>
repose angle is over 36° and less than 44°, the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention is<br>
especially superior because at a high drug content of<br><br>
about 30% by weight or more, addition of a small amount<br>
of 1-30% by weight of the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention gives physical property required<br>
for a formulation such as sufficient compactibility,<br>
friability, disintegration property, content uniformity<br>
and the like. When a cylindrical molded body, obtained<br>
by weighing 0.5 g of a drug having a tablet pressing<br>
problems such as sticking, capping and the like,<br>
placing it in a die (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, Material<br>
SUS2, 3 were used), compressing with a circular flat<br>
punch with a diameter of 1.1 cm (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO<br>
LTD, Material SUS2, 3 were used) until the pressure of<br>
50 MPa was attained (AIKOH ENGINEERING CO., LTD. PCM-1A<br>
was used. The compression rate was 1 cm/minute), and<br>
holding at the target pressure for 10 seconds, have<br>
preferably the hardness of 50 N or lower, preferably 40<br>
N or lower, more preferably 20 N or lower, or when both<br>
of the characteristics are present, the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention is<br>
especially effective. For conventional cellulose<br>
powder, even if the tablet pressing problems such as<br>
sticking and capping can be controlled at a high drug<br>
content of about 30% by weight, the fluidity was not<br>
sufficient, and the practical application was not<br>
possible due to the tablet weight CV, content CV and<br>
the like. The present invention has markedly improved<br>
the fluidity of the conventional cellulose powder in<br>
the usage described above, and is superior in<br><br>
expressing both compactibility and fluidity at high<br>
level, despite of the fact that compactibility and<br>
fluidity have been contradictory characteristics until<br>
now. Further, when the aforementioned cylindrical<br>
molded body obtained by compressing to 10 MPa has<br>
hardness of 60-100 N, or the one obtained by<br>
compressing to 20 MPa has hardness of 165-410 N and a<br>
repose angle is 25-36°, the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
of the present invention is especially preferred<br>
because the high drug content of 30% by weight or above<br>
has become possible for the first time in a formulation<br>
that can contain an excipient at about 30% by weight or<br>
more. For the conventional cellulose, lowering the<br>
repose angle causes lowering of the compactibility, and<br>
thus even if the cellulose powder content is about 30%<br>
by weight or more, in trying to increase drug content,<br>
the cellulose powder having good fluidity shows<br>
insufficient compactibility and the cellulose powder<br>
having good compactibility shows insufficient fluidity<br>
resulting in difficulty in formulating, but the present<br>
invention has markedly improved the fluidity of the<br>
conventional cellulose powder in the usage described<br>
above, and is superior in expressing both<br>
compactibility and fluidity at high level, despite of<br>
the fact that compactibility and fluidity have been<br>
contradictory characteristics until now. For the<br>
porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention,<br>
the disintegration time of the cylindrical molded body<br><br>
obtained under the condition of compressing to a<br>
pressure of 20 MPa and keeping the target pressure for<br>
10 seconds by the aforementioned method is preferably<br>
for 75 seconds or shorter for the sake of<br>
disintegration property. Especially preferable if it<br>
is 50 seconds or shorter. This disintegration time is<br>
shorter the better. Normally, an active ingredient is<br>
prepared so that when administered, it diffuses in<br>
gastric juice and intestinal juice media and enhances<br>
drug effect rapidly, but when the disintegration time<br>
of the molded body is getting longer, and the drug is<br>
eluted from the molded body slower and not absorbed at<br>
the digestive tract quickly, and the rapid drug effect<br>
tends to be decreased.<br>
[0048]<br>
Since compression compactibility and<br>
disintegration property are contradictory<br>
characteristics and the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention raised these characteristics to a<br>
level not achieved before, preferably the hardness of<br>
the cylindrical molded body obtained by compressing to<br>
10 MPa is 60-160 N, or the hardness of the cylindrical<br>
molded body obtained by compressing to 20 MPa is 165-<br>
410 N and the disintegration time is 75 seconds or<br>
shorter, and especially preferably the hardness of the<br>
cylindrical molded body obtained by compressing to 10<br>
MPa is 60-160 N, or the hardness of the cylindrical<br>
molded body obtained by compressing to 20 MPa is 165-<br><br>
410 N and the disintegration time is 50 seconds or<br>
shorter. Since the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention can be made with a larger median pore<br>
diameter compared to the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the Patent Document 1, it has a higher swelling degree,<br>
and when compared at the same hardness, it has an<br>
advantage of having a shorter disintegration time.<br>
[0049]<br>
A formulated powder is obtained by placing 55<br>
weight parts of acetaminophen (API Corporation, powder<br>
type), 0.25 weight parts of light anhydrous silicic<br>
acid (NIPPON AEROSIL CO., LTD., Commercial name:<br>
Aerosil 200), 27 weight parts of cellulose powder, 2<br>
weight parts of crospovidone (BASF, Commercial name:<br>
Collidone CL) and 15 weight parts of granular lactose<br>
(Lactose New Zealand, Commercial Name: Super-Tab) in a<br>
100 L scale V Type Mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd.) and mixing<br>
for 30 minutes, and then adding 0.5 weight parts of<br>
magnesium stearate (TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO.,<br>
LTD., Plant origin) and mixing for further 5 minutes.<br>
Thus obtained formulated powder is subjected to tablet<br>
pressing using a rotary tablet press (KIKUSUI<br>
SEISAKUSHO LTD, Commercial name: LIBRA-II, 36 lines,<br>
Rotary table Φ410 mm) and a punch with 8 mm diameter and<br>
12 R, at a turn table speed of 50 rpm, at a compression<br>
force of 7.5 kN. For the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention it is preferable that thus<br>
obtained 200 mg molded body has a hardness of 50 N or<br><br>
higher and a friability of less than 1% and no tablet<br>
pressing problem.<br>
[0050]<br>
An excipient having high compactibility is<br>
required to give hardness and to reduce friability to a<br>
formulation containing a large quantity of a drug<br>
having poor compactibility, and at the same time an<br>
excipient having fluidity is required to reduce the<br>
variation of weight when a high speed and continuous<br>
compacting is performed. Such a formulation containing<br>
a large amount of a drug having low compactibility and<br>
the production of the molded body at such a high speed<br>
can only be realized by mixing the excipient having<br>
good compactibility and good fluidity such as the<br>
present invention. When the hardness of the molded<br>
body is less than 50 N and the friability is 1% or<br>
larger, it is not preferred because abrasion, dust<br>
generation, cracking and chipping occur during<br>
transportation. Occurrence of tablet pressing problems<br>
is not preferred because inferior products are<br>
produced. The hardness here is higher the better but<br>
is at most 100 N, and the friability is lower the<br>
better.<br>
[0051]<br>
For the porous cellulose aggregate of the<br>
present invention the tablet hardness of the compacting<br>
composition is preferably 50-100 N (tablet pressing<br>
pressure range: 1-10 kN) and the variation of tablet<br><br>
weight (CV value) is preferably 2.0 or less when the<br>
repose angle of the final whole formulated powder which<br>
composes the compacting composition of the present<br>
invention is 25°-45° by adding 30-90% by weight of<br>
cellulose particles to 0.001-50% by weight of a<br>
formulated powder having poor fluidity consisting of an<br>
active ingredient and components other than cellulose<br>
particles and having a repose angle of 45°-55°, and<br>
tablets are pressed at the high speed of 50,000 tablets<br>
or more per hour. Preferably the whole formulated<br>
powder has a repose angle of 45° or less, the tablet<br>
hardness of the compacting composition is 50-100 N and<br>
the variation of the tablet weight (CV value) is 1.5%<br>
or less, and especially preferably the whole formulated<br>
powder has a repose angle of 42° or less, the tablet<br>
hardness of the compacting composition is 50-100 N and<br>
the variation of the tablet weight (CV value) is 1.0%<br>
or less (Example 17-19 and Comparative Example 80-91).<br>
[0052]<br>
In direct tablet pressing and the like, when<br>
the fluidity of the active ingredient in the<br>
composition and components other than the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention is bad<br>
(repose angle of 45°-55°) and/or the compression<br>
compactibility of such components are poor, it is one<br>
of the characteristics that a remarkable effect can be<br>
obtained by mixing the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention in a large quantity which could<br><br>
not be obtained by conventional cellulose particles and<br>
cellulose powder, because the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention has compactibility,<br>
fluidity and disintegration property in a good balance.<br>
That is, in conventional cellulose powder and cellulose<br>
particles, the compactibility increases as the added<br>
amount of cellulose is increased but the fluidity and<br>
disintegration property are getting poorer due to the<br>
fluidity being closer to that of cellulose powder and<br>
cellulose particles themselves, and consequently there<br>
were problems that the high speed tablet pressing at a<br>
practical production speed was difficult and that the<br>
disintegration of thus obtained tablets was delayed.<br>
Against such problems, the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
of the present invention has an advantage of the<br>
fluidity being improved rather than getting worse when<br>
the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention<br>
is mixed in a large quantity, because the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a<br>
superior balance in the compactibility and fluidity,<br>
disintegration property at such a high level which is<br>
not attainable by the conventional cellulose powder and<br>
cellulose particles. "Mixing in a large quantity" in<br>
the present invention means that the composition<br>
contains 30-90% of the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention. Preferably the content is 30-<br>
80% and especially preferably 30-70%.<br>
[0053]<br><br>
Following is the description of the method<br>
for producing the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention.<br>
To produce the porous cellulose aggregate of<br>
the present invention, for example, a dispersion<br>
containing a natural cellulose material (hereinafter<br>
also designated as cellulose dispersion) needs to be<br>
obtained in which the average particle size of the<br>
primary cellulose particles is 10 µm or larger and less<br>
than 50 µm, the average width is 2-30 µm, and the<br>
average thickness is 0.5-5 µm. It is preferable<br>
because entanglement of the primary cellulose particles<br>
to each other can be promoted during the drying process<br>
by making the primary cellulose particles in such a<br>
shape. In the past, it was difficult to keep the shape<br>
of aggregated particles spherical because the longer<br>
the major axis of the primary cellulose particles is,<br>
the more difficult for entanglement of particles to<br>
occur. However, the present invention has focused on<br>
the shape of the primary cellulose particles and proven<br>
for the first time that the entanglement of the<br>
particles can be promoted by controlling it in a<br>
specific range. By promoting the entanglement of the<br>
primary cellulose particles each other, it became<br>
possible for the first time to make the aggregated<br>
particles in a spherical form in an easily controllable<br>
manner and to enhance plastic deformability of the<br>
particles thus giving compactibility more easily by<br><br>
creating gaps inside of the aggregated particles. In<br>
the past, to control the shape of aggregated particles<br>
spherical, the major axis of the primary cellulose<br>
particles need to be shortened. However, during the<br>
process of treating the primary cellulose particles by<br>
a mechanical treatment or hydrolysis, or a combination<br>
of both, the shorter the major axis of the primary<br>
cellulose particles becomes, the more of the fine<br>
fragments of the primary cellulose particles are<br>
generated, creating the problem that these fine<br>
fragments occupy the gap between the aggregated<br>
particles and a sufficient mold deformity can not be<br>
obtained and the compactibility is decreased. Thus, it<br>
was necessary to granulate particles without shortening<br>
the major axis of the primary cellulose particles, but<br>
such particles are difficult to aggregate and to<br>
improve sphericity. Since the generation of the fine<br>
fragments of the primary cellulose particles described<br>
above in large quantity causes filling of the gaps<br>
between the aggregated particles, it is preferable to<br>
prepare a cellulose dispersion that contains 10% by<br>
weight or less particles that are not sedimented under<br>
a centrifuge condition with a centrifugal force of 4900<br>
m/s2. The porous cellulose aggregate of the present<br>
invention can be obtained by the method for production<br>
including a step of drying that cellulose dispersion.<br>

The natural cellulose substance in the<br><br>
Means for solving the Problem<br>
[0029]<br>
The present inventors, to solve the<br>
aforementioned problem, controlled the particle<br>
structure of a cellulose aggregate, expressed a<br>
secondary aggregate structure, increased an<br>
intraparticular pore volume of the cellulose aggregate<br>
and controlled the powder properties of the cellulose<br>
aggregate to a specific range to complete the present<br>
invention.<br>
That is, the present invention is as follows.<br>
[0030]<br>
(1)	A porous cellulose aggregate having a<br>
secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of<br>
primary cellulose particles, a pore volume within a<br>
particle of 0.265 cm3/g-2.625 cm3/g, containing type I<br>
crystals, and having an average particle size of more<br>
than 30 µm and 250 µm or less, a specific surface area<br>
of 0.1 m2/g or more and less than 20 m2/g, a repose<br>
angle of 25° or more and less than 44°, a swelling<br>
degree of 5% or more, and properties to disintegrate in<br>
water.<br>
(2)	The porous cellulose aggregate according to<br>
(1), in which a cylinder-like molded body having a<br>
hardness of 70-160 N and a repose angle of over 36° and<br>
less than 44° is obtained by weighing 0.5 g of the<br>
aforementioned porous cellulose aggregate and placing<br><br>
present invention may be derived from plants or animals<br>
and includes fibrous substances derived from natural<br>
products containing cellulose, for example, wood,<br>
bamboo, straw, cotton, ramie, bagasse, kenaf, beet,<br>
ascidian and bacterial cellulose, and may have a<br>
crystalline structure of type I cellulose. Among the<br>
above natural cellulose substances, one group may be<br>
used as a material or a mixture of two or more groups<br>
can be used. It is preferable to be used in the form<br>
of purified pulp but the purification of the pulp is<br>
not particularly restricted, and any of the dissolved<br>
pulp, kraft pulp, NBKP pulp and the like may be used.<br>
The pulp derived from wood is preferable because of the<br>
high purity of a-cellulose, easiness to obtain, the<br>
supply being stable and the like.<br>
It is preferably a wood pulp in which a level<br>
off polymerization degree measured by the copper<br>
ethylenediamine solution method is 130-250, and<br>
whiteness 90-99%, S10 is 5-20% and S18 is 1-10%. The<br>
level off polymerization degree of less than 130 is not<br>
preferable because the compactibility is hard to be<br>
expressed. The polymerization degree of over 250 is<br>
not preferable because the average width and average<br>
thickness of the primary cellulose particles are hard<br>
to control in a specified range. The whiteness of less<br>
than 90 is not preferable because the external<br>
appearance of the porous cellulose aggregate is poor.<br>
The whiteness is higher the better but is at most about<br><br>
99%. S10 and S18 of outside the range described above<br>
are not preferable in the compactibility and yield.<br>
Here, in the natural cellulose substance, the material<br>
such as pulp may be hydrolyzed or not hydrolyzed. If<br>
hydrolyzed in particular, it may be acid hydrolysis,<br>
alkali hydrolysis, thermal hydrolysis, steam explosion<br>
or the like, and may be any one of the method or a<br>
combination of two or more methods.<br>
[0055]<br>
In the method described above, a medium that<br>
is used for dispersing a solid containing the natural<br>
cellulose substance is preferably water but is not<br>
particularly restricted as long as it can be used<br>
industrially, for example, a mixture of water and an<br>
organic solvent may be used. The organic solvent<br>
includes, for example: alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, 2-<br>
methylbutyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol; hydrocarbons<br>
such as pentane, hexane, heptane and cyclohexane;<br>
ketones such as acetone and ethylmethyl ketone. In<br>
particular, the organic solvent that can be used for<br>
pharmaceutical use is preferred and includes those<br>
classified as solvents in "Pharmaceutical additives"<br>
(published by Yakuji Nippo Limited.). Water and<br>
organic solvents are freely used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more, and after dispersing the<br>
cellulose in one kind of medium, the medium is removed<br>
and the cellulose may be dispersed in a different<br><br>
medium.<br>
[0056]<br>
The porous cellulose aggregate of the present<br>
invention needs to be produced by preparing a cellulose<br>
dispersion, in which the primary cellulose particles<br>
have an average particle size of 10 µm or above and<br>
less than 50 µm, an average width of 2-30 µm, an<br>
average thickness of 0.5-5 µm, and which contains 5-40%<br>
by weight of the solid fraction, by subjecting the<br>
natural cellulose substance to treatments that are not<br>
particularly restricted as long as they are publicly<br>
known, for example, mechanical treatment such as<br>
milling and grinding, or chemical treatment such as<br>
hydrolysis or an appropriate treatment of a combination<br>
of both, and then by drying the dispersion.<br>
[0057]<br>
The primary cellulose particles in the<br>
present invention mean particles having the size in the<br>
range of 1-500 µm in which the fibers are split and<br>
newly formed, in the case of fibers composing the<br>
natural cellulose substance, or in the cases where the<br>
natural cellulose substance is subjected to mechanical<br>
treatments such as milling and grinding or the natural<br>
cellulose substance is subjected to chemical treatment<br>
such as hydrolysis. A method for making the average<br>
particle size of the primary cellulose particles less<br>
than 50 µm is achieved, for example, by a mechanical<br>
treatment such as milling and grinding, or a publicly<br><br>
known separation treatment such as cyclone,<br>
centrifugation and sieving or an appropriate<br>
combination of both by controlling appropriately<br>
conditions generally known to influence the treatment<br>
such as the amount to be treated, shearing force<br>
(rotating rate, shape and size of rotating wings and<br>
the like can influence), centrifugal force and the size<br>
of the sieve mesh, or for example, by a chemical<br>
treatment such as acid hydrolysis by changing<br>
appropriately conditions such as acid concentration and<br>
temperature, or in addition to these by changing<br>
appropriately conditions that are already known to<br>
influence the mechanical treatment and separation<br>
treatment described above.<br>
[0058]<br>
Performing hydrolysis at higher acid or<br>
alkali concentration and reaction temperature, in<br>
general, the polymerization degree of cellulose tends<br>
to be lower and the average dispersed particle size of<br>
cellulose in the dispersion tends to be smaller. Also<br>
stirring the solution with more force, the average<br>
dispersed particle size of cellulose tends to be<br>
smaller. Therefore, by controlling the stirring force<br>
in the steps of hydrolysis and/or dispersion of the<br>
natural cellulose substance, the polymerization degree<br>
of the material cellulose can be controlled in the<br>
desired range. Since the stirring force is dependent<br>
on a width, height, volume of the stirring layer, a<br><br>
kind of wing, a wind diameter, the stirring rotation<br>
rate and the like, it is difficult to define in a<br>
specific range, but it is preferable that the product<br>
of the wing diameter (m) and the stirring rotation rate<br>
(rpm) is in the range of 5-200, more preferably 10-150,<br>
especially preferably 10-120.<br>
[0059]<br>
A method for making the primary cellulose<br>
particles have an average width of 2-30 µm, an average<br>
thickness 0.5-5 µm is not particularly restricted as<br>
long as the method, for example, splits the primary<br>
cellulose particles to a longitudinal direction, and<br>
includes a method that subjects wood pulp to a<br>
treatment such as a high pressure homogenizer treatment<br>
and optionally to a mechanical treatment such as<br>
grinding and a fraction treatment or an appropriate<br>
combination of both. In the high pressure homogenizer<br>
treatment a pressure may be appropriately controlled in<br>
the range of 10-200 MPa but it may also be dependent on<br>
the amount to be treated. Also, a pulp may be selected<br>
and used in which the primary cellulose particles have<br>
an average width of 2-30 µm and an average thickness of<br>
0.5-5 µm. The cellulose dispersion is preferably<br>
prepared containing particles that are not precipitated<br>
by a centrifugal of condition centrifugal force of 4 900<br>
m/s2 at 10% by weight or less, and such methods<br>
includes, for example, in the case of acid hydrolysis,<br>
a method for changing the hydrolysis conditions<br><br>
appropriately so that the hydrolysis is difficult to<br>
proceed, a method for removing fine particle components<br>
that are hard to precipitate from the residue or the<br>
dispersion by the separation treatment or the like, or<br>
a combination of both methods.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the hydrolysis of a natural cellulose<br>
substance there is a tendency that the higher the acid<br>
concentration and the higher the temperature, the more<br>
fine particle components that are hard to precipitate<br>
are generated, but since the extent of hydrolysis is<br>
different depending on the degree of polymerization of<br>
the natural cellulose substance, origin of the<br>
material, the extraction method for the cellulose<br>
substance such as method for producing pulp and the<br>
like, it is difficult to define the hydrolysis<br>
conditions in a universal way. However, an appropriate<br>
hydrolysis condition can be readily determined by<br>
measuring the weight of particles which are not<br>
precipitated at a centrifugal condition of centrifugal<br>
force of 4900 m/s2 under which the% by weight of the<br>
particles is 10% by weight or less.<br>
[0061]<br>
The centrifugal condition of centrifugal<br>
force of 4900 m/s2 in the present invention means to<br>
determine the rotating rate for each commercially<br>
available centrifuge considering the rotating radius<br>
(using the maximum radius) of the centrifuge using the<br><br>
calculation method for a centrifugal force defined by<br>
the following formula, and under the condition of such<br>
rotating rate to perform a centrifugation at the range<br>
of the temperature of 15-25°C for 10 minutes. As the<br>
commercially available centrifuge, an inverter-multi<br>
purpose high speed refrigerated centrifuge (Type 6930,<br>
KUBOTA Corporation, Rapid was used as a mode for<br>
acceleration and deceleration) and a RA-400 angle rotor<br>
(volume: 50 cm3, material: polypropylene co-polymer,<br>
tube angle: 35°, the maximum radius: 10.5 cm, the<br>
minimum radius: 5.8 cm, rotation rate: 4100 rpm) are<br>
preferably used.<br>
Centrifugal force (m/s2) = 11.18 x (rotation<br>
rate (rpm)/1000)2 x rotation radius (cm) x 9.8(m/s2)<br>
[0062]<br>
To prepare a cellulose dispersion, in which<br>
the average particle size of the primary cellulose<br>
particles is 10 µm or above and less than 50 µm, an<br>
average width is 2-30 µm and an average thickness is<br>
0.5-5 µm (preferably, in addition to these, particles<br>
that are not precipitated at the centrifugal condition<br>
of centrifugal force of 4900 m/s2 are 10% by weight or<br>
less) , contributes to form gaps inside the aggregate<br>
due to the entanglement each other between the<br>
neighboring primary cellulose particles when aggregates<br>
of the primary cellulose particles are formed, because<br>
the primary cellulose particles having a specific<br>
average width and average thickness are flexible when<br><br>
the cellulose dispersion is dried, and further<br>
preferably contributes for the gaps formed in the<br>
aggregates, without being embedded by the particles, to<br>
continue forming porous secondary aggregate structure<br>
having a large intraparticular pore volume after drying<br>
because among the primary cellulose particles in the<br>
cellulose dispersion, 10% by weight or less of the<br>
particles are not precipitated at the centrifugal<br>
condition of centrifugal force of 4900 m/s2.<br>
[0063]<br>
When the average particle size of the primary<br>
cellulose particles become 50 µm or larger, the<br>
secondary aggregate structure is hard to form even if<br>
the shape of the primary cellulose particles is in the<br>
specific range, and the primary particles are dried<br>
individually and this is not preferable in the aspect<br>
of the intraparticular pore volume. Further the<br>
apparent specific volume becomes too large and this is<br>
not preferable in the aspect of the fluidity.<br>
When the average particle size of the primary<br>
cellulose particles is 10 µm or less, the inter-<br>
particular bonding force is too strong when the<br>
particles form the secondary aggregate structure and<br>
this is not preferable in the aspect of disintegration<br>
property. When the average width of the primary<br>
cellulose particles exceeds 30 µm, the primary<br>
cellulose particles become difficult to bend, and the<br>
entanglement between neighboring primary cellulose<br><br>
particles is decreased, and this is not preferrec in<br>
the aspect of the intraparticular pore volume. When<br>
the average width of the primary cellulose particles is<br>
less than 2 µm, the particles aggregate densely and the<br>
intraarticular pores are not formed. This is not<br>
preferred because the compactibility and disintegration<br>
property are worsened. When the average thickness of<br>
the primary cellulose particles is over 5 µm, the<br>
primary cellulose particles become difficult to bend,<br>
and the entanglement between neighboring primary<br>
cellulose particles is decreased, and this is not<br>
preferred in the aspect of the intraparticular pore<br>
volume. The lower limit of the average thickness of<br>
the primary cellulose particles is the lower, the<br>
easier it is for the particles to entangle, and this is<br>
preferable in the aspect of the intraparticular pore<br>
volume, but this is at most about 0.5 µm. When the<br>
width of the primary cellulose particles is less than 2<br>
µm and the thickness is less than 0.5 µm, such fine<br>
particles are bound tightly, and the intraparticular<br>
pore volume becomes small and thus this is not<br>
preferred because of poor compactibility and<br>
disintegration property.<br>
[0064]<br>
The primary cellulose particles are<br>
preferably used which has a particle shape having the<br>
ratio of the average values of the major axis and minor<br>
axis (L/D) of 2.0 or above. The larger is the L/D, the<br><br>
more effective it is in inhibiting excessive particle<br>
aggregate in drying, and this contributes to give a<br>
larger pore volume in the particles.<br>
[0065]<br>
The cellulose dispersion of the present<br>
invention is not particularly restricted and may be<br>
produced by any one of the methods selected from i) a<br>
method for producing the cellulose dispersion using the<br>
primary cellulose particles by treating one or<br>
plurality of natural cellulose substances, ii) a method<br>
for producing the cellulose dispersion by dividing the<br>
cellulose dispersion of the aforementioned i), treating<br>
separately and then mixing, iii) a method for producing<br>
the cellulose dispersion by fractionating the cellulose<br>
dispersion of the aforementioned i) or ii), treating<br>
them separately and then mixing again or iv) a method<br>
for producing the cellulose dispersion by mixing two or<br>
more groups of the primary cellulose particles prepared<br>
separately, and from the economical point of view i) is<br>
especially preferable. The treatment method used here<br>
may be a wet method or a dry method, or respective<br>
products obtained by the wet method may be mixed before<br>
drying, or respective products obtained by the dry<br>
method may be mixed before drying or products obtained<br>
by the wet method and dry method may be combined. The<br>
treatment method may be a publicly known method and the<br>
like, and not particularly restricted, including, for<br>
example, a mechanical treatment such as milling and<br><br>
grinding, and a separation treatment such as<br>
centrifugal separation using a cyclone or a centrifuge<br>
and sieving using a thieve. The method may be used<br>
singly or in combination of both methods.<br>
[0066]<br>
The grinding method may be a grinding method<br>
using the stirring blade of the one-way rotating,<br>
multi-shaft rotary, reciprocating/reversing, vertically<br>
moving, rotating+vertically moving, or duct type such<br>
as a portable mixer, a spatial mixer, a side mixer, or<br>
the like, a jet-type stirring/grinding method such as a<br>
line mixer, a grinding method using a high-shear<br>
homogenizer, a high-pressure homogenizer, an ultrasonic<br>
homogenizer, or the like; or a grinding method using a<br>
rotating axis extrusion kneader. The milling method to<br>
be used may be any one of: a screen milling method such<br>
as a screen mill and hammer mill; a rotating blade<br>
shear screen milling method such as a flush mill; a jet<br>
milling method such as a jet mill; a ball milling<br>
method such as a ball mill, vibration ball milling; a<br>
screw type stirring milling method; and the like.<br>
[0067]<br>
The cellulose dispersion particle mixture<br>
obtained by the aforementioned procedure is preferably<br>
made into a dispersion of a concentration of 5-40% by<br>
weight before drying. If the concentration is less<br>
than 5% by weight, the average particle size of the<br>
cellulose particles to be obtained decreases and the<br><br>
water soluble macromolecules described in<br>

Limited.) such as hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyacrylic acid,<br>
carboxyvinyl polymer, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methylcellulose, gum<br>
Arabic and starch glue, and one kind may be used alone<br>
or a combination of two kinds or more may be used.<br>
[0070]<br>

alone or a combination of two kinds or more may be used<br>
freely.<br>
[0071]<br>

Yakuji Nippo Limited.), for example, tartaric acid,<br>
sodium bicarbonate, potato starch, anhydrous citric<br>
acid, medicinal soap, sodium laurylsulfate, lauric<br>
diethanolamide, macrogoaliaurate, and one kind may be<br>
used alone or a combination of two kinds or more may be<br>
used. Also, other than the pharmaceutical additives,<br>
bicarbonate such as sodium bicarbonate and ammonium<br>
bicarbonate that generate gas by pyrolysis, and<br>
carbonates such as sodium carbonate and ammonium<br>
carbonate that generate gas by reacting with acids may<br>
be used. However, when carbonates described above are<br>
to be used, an acid must be used together. The acid<br>
includes: organic acids such as citric acid, acetic<br>
acid, ascorbic acid, adipic acid; protonic acids such<br>
as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid<br>
and nitric acid; Lewis acids such as boron fluoride,<br>
and the one used for pharmaceuticals/foods is preferred<br>
but others have the similar effect. In place of the<br>
foaming agent, gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide,<br>
liquefied petroleum gas and dimethyl ether may<br>
impregnate the dispersion.<br>
These water soluble macromolecules,<br>
surfactants and gas generating substances may be added<br>
before drying and the timing of addition is not<br>
particularly restricted.<br>

Following is the description of the method<br>
for production of the tablets, the main components of<br>
which are one or plurality of active ingredients and<br>
the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention, but this is an example and the effect of the<br>
invention is not limited by the following method. The<br>
method can be used including a step of mixing an active<br>
ingredient and the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention and then a step of compression<br>
compacting. During these steps additives other than<br>
the active ingredient can be mixed optionally, and one<br>
or more kind of the components for example selected<br>
from the group shown above such as excipients,<br>
disintegrators, binders, fluidizers, lubricants,<br>
tasting agents, flavors, dyes, sweeteners and<br>
solubilizers may be added.<br>
[0093]<br>
The order of the addition of the respective<br>
components is not particularly restricted, and any of<br>
the method may be used, i) by which the active<br>
ingredient, the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention and optionally other additives are<br>
mixed altogether and subjected to compression<br>
compacting or ii) by which the active ingredient, and<br>
the additives such as the fluidizer and/or lubricant<br>
are pre-mixed and then mixed with the porous cellulose<br>
aggregates of the present invention and, optionally,<br><br>
with other additives, and subsequently the mixture is<br>
subjected to compression compacting. The lubricant may<br>
be added to the powder mixture for compression<br>
compacting obtained in i) or ii), mixing is continued<br>
and then the mixture may be subjected to compression<br>
compacting.<br>
[0094]<br>
When an active ingredient hard to be soluble<br>
in water is especially used, the following production<br>
method can be used. The production methods, for<br>
example, may be any of, the methods: i) by which the<br>
active ingredient is ground or used as it is, mixed<br>
with the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention and optionally with the other additives, and<br>
then the mixture is subjected to compression<br>
compacting, or ii) by which, after dissolving or<br>
dispersing the active ingredient in water and/or an<br>
organic solvent and/or a solubilizer, the solution or<br>
dispersion is absorbed to the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate of the present invention and/or optionally to<br>
the other additives, and mixed with the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate and/or optionally with the other<br>
additives, and after distilling off water and/or the<br>
organic solvent optionally, the mixture is subjected to<br>
compression compacting.<br>
[0095]<br>
Among i), in particular, it is preferable<br>
from the view point of compactibility and fluidity that<br><br>
after mixing an active ingredient with additives such<br>
as a fluidizer in advance , the active ingredient is<br>
mixed with the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention and optionally with other components<br>
and subjected to compression compacting. The<br>
crystalline form of the active ingredient before<br>
compression compacting may be the same or different<br>
from that before the formulation, it is preferable to<br>
be the same from the view point of the stability. When<br>
using a water insoluble active ingredient, it is<br>
effective to use a water soluble polymer or surfactant<br>
in combination especially as a solubilizer to disperse<br>
the active ingredient into the medium. Here, the other<br>
additive means an additive other than the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention,<br>
including, for example, the aforementioned excipients,<br>
disintegrators, binders, fluidizers, lubricants,<br>
tasting agents, flavors, sweeteners and solubilizers.<br>
These additives may be used alone or in a combination<br>
of two or more kinds.<br>
[0096]<br>
In the cases of ii) in particular, since the<br>
active ingredient that is hard to be soluble or<br>
insoluble in water goes through a step of<br>
solubilization or dispersion once, an improving effect<br>
for the elution of the active ingredient can be<br>
expected. When a liquid dispersion medium such as<br>
polyethylene glycol is used in combination as a<br><br>
dispersion medium for a pharmaceutical active<br>
ingredient, the dispersed becomes liquid or semi-solid<br>
even if the active ingredient is originally a<br>
crystalline powder, and thus tablet formulation<br>
therefrom is impossible unless a substance such as the<br>
porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention<br>
having superior compression compactibility and fluidity<br>
is used. Further, when polyethylene glycol or the like<br>
is used as a dispersing agent for a pharmaceutical<br>
active ingredient, it is said that the active<br>
ingredient absorbed in the body takes a structure<br>
covered by polyethylene glycol in the blood stream, and<br>
thus it is expected that the effect of the active<br>
ingredient that is easily metabolized in the liver<br>
lasts longer.<br>
[0097]<br>
A method for adding each component is not<br>
particularly restricted if it is commonly practiced<br>
method, and either the continuous addition or one time<br>
addition may be performed using a small suction<br>
transport device, air transport device, bucket<br>
conveyer, pressure transport device, vacuum conveyer,<br>
quantitative vibration feeder, spray, funnel and the<br>
like.<br>
[0098]<br>
When the active ingredient is a solution,<br>
suspension or emulsion, it is preferable to adopt a<br>
method of spraying that to the porous cellulose<br><br>
aggregates of the present invention or to the other<br>
additive because it reduces the variation of the<br>
concentration of the active ingredient in the final<br>
products. The spray method may be any methods for<br>
spraying the solution/dispersion of the active<br>
ingredient using a pressure nozzle, 2-fluid nozzle, 4-<br>
fluid nozzle, rotating disc, ultrasonic nozzle or the<br>
like, or methods for instilling the solution/dispersion<br>
of the active ingredient from a tube like nozzle. When<br>
the solution/dispersion of the active ingredient is<br>
added, the active ingredient may be layered on the<br>
surface of the porous cellulose aggregate particles by<br>
layering or coating treatment, may be held inside of<br>
the porous cellulose aggregate particles, or the<br>
solution/dispersion of the active ingredient may be<br>
used as a binding agent for granulating the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate particles or a mixture of the<br>
porous cellulose and the other additives in a matrix-<br>
like structure. The layering and coating treatment may<br>
be performed by a wet method or a dry method.<br>
[0099]<br>
A method for mixing is not particularly<br>
restricted if it is a commonly practiced method, and it<br>
may use a vessel rotation type mixer such as a V type,<br>
W type, double corn type, or container tack type mixer,<br>
a stirring mixer such as a high-speed agitation type,<br>
universal agitation type, ribbon type, pug type, or<br>
nautor type mixer, a super mixer, a drum type mixer, or<br><br>
a fluidized bed type mixer. In addition, a vessel<br>
shaking type mixer such as a shaker may be also used.<br>
[0100]<br>
A method for the compression compacting of<br>
the composition is not particularly restricted if it is<br>
a commonly practiced method; a method which includes<br>
using a die and a punch for making the composition into<br>
a desired form by means of the compression compacting<br>
or a method which includes preliminarily making the<br>
composition into sheet form by means of the compression<br>
compacting, and cutting into a desired form may be<br>
used. A compression compacting machine may use, for<br>
example, a roller type press such as a hydrostatic<br>
press, a briquetting roller type press, or a smoothing<br>
roller type press, or a compressor such as a single-<br>
punch tableting machine or a rotary tableting machine.<br>
[0101]<br>
A method for dissolving or dispersing an<br>
active ingredient in a medium is not particularly<br>
restricted if it is carried out by the usual<br>
dissolution or dispersion method; a stirring/mixing<br>
method such as a portable mixer, a spatial mixer, a<br>
side mixer, or the like using the stirring blade of the<br>
one-way rotating, multi-shaft rotary,<br>
reciprocating/reversing, vertically moving,<br>
rotating+vertically moving, or duct type, a jer-type<br>
stirring/mixing method such as a line mixer, a gas-<br>
blowing stirring/mixing method, a mixing method using a<br><br>
high-shear homogenizer, a high-pressure homogenizer, an<br>
ultrasonic homogenizer, or the like, or a mixing method<br>
of vessel shaking type using a shaker, or the like may<br>
be used.<br>

alcohol, hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane<br>
and cyclohexane, ketones such as acetone and<br>
ethylmethylketone, and one kind selected from the above<br>
group may be used alone or a combination of two or more<br>
kinds may be used freely, or after dispersing with one<br>
kind of solvent, the solvent may be removed and another<br>
solvent may be used for dispersion.<br>
[0103]<br>

these may be used alone or in a combination of two or<br>
more kinds freely.<br>
[0105]<br>
A surfactant as a solubilizer may be, for<br>
example, those classified as a surfactant in<br>
"Pharmaceutical additives" (published by Yakuji Nippo<br>
Limited.), including phospholipid, glycerin fatty acid<br>
ester, polyethylene glycol fatty acid ester, sorbitan<br>

[0106]<br>
As used herein, "tablet" refers to a molded<br>
body obtained by compression compacting that includes<br>
the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention, one or more active ingredients, and<br>
optionally other additives. A composition for a<br>
tablet, formulated with the porous cellulose aggregates<br>
of the present invention has practical hardness<br>
obtained by a simple and easy method such as direct<br>
tablet pressing without going through a complex<br>
process; however, any preparation method including a<br>
dry granule compression method, a wet granule<br>
compression method, wet granulation compression<br>
(extragranular addition of microcrystalline cellulose),<br>
or a method for preparing a multicore tablet using, as<br>
inner core, a tablet preliminarily subjected to<br>
compression compacting a method for preparing a multi-<br>
layer tablet by stacking molded bodies preliminarily<br>
subjected to compression compacting and compressing<br>
them again may be also used.<br>
[0107]<br>
Since the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention is superior in various physical<br>
properties required for an excipient such as<br>
compression compactibility, self fluidity and<br>
disintegration property, it is effectively used for:<br>
tablets containing many kinds and a large quantity of<br><br>
drugs, which tend to cause tablet pressing troubles<br>
such as lowering of tablet hardness, fractures on the<br>
surface of the tablet, chipping, peeling off from<br>
inside and cracking, for example, the tablets for over-<br>
the-counter drugs and tablets containing extract powder<br>
such as Chinese herb medicine; small tablets; non-<br>
cylinder type odd shaped tablets having a part where<br>
compression pressure is difficult to be applied<br>
homogeneously such as a constricted edge; tablets<br>
containing drugs like enzymes/proteins that are easily<br>
inactivated by tabletting pressure or friction with the<br>
excipient; and tablets containing coated granules. In<br>
addition, since the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention is superior in compression compactibility and<br>
disintegration property, tablets having a practical<br>
friability can be obtained at a relatively low<br>
compression pressure. For that reason, gaps (watering<br>
capillary) can be maintained in the tablet, it is<br>
effectively used for tablets that disintegrate quickly<br>
in the oral cavity.<br>
[0108]<br>
Further, for multi-layer and multi-core<br>
tablets in which several components of the composition<br>
are compression molded in one or multi-steps, the<br>
porous cellulose aggregates of the present invention is<br>
effective, in addition to preventing the general tablet<br>
pressing troubles described above, in preventing<br>
peeling between the layers and cracks. Having a<br><br>
secondary aggregate structure that is formed by the<br>
aggregation of the primary particles, the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention has a<br>
good cleavability of the particle itself, and when used<br>
in a scored tablet, it is easy to cleave the tablet<br>
evenly. Still further, having a well developed porous<br>
structure, the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention has a good retention of drugs in a<br>
fine particulate condition, in a suspension liquid and<br>
in solubilized solution, and thus the tablets utilizing<br>
these have also a good retention of drugs in a fine<br>
particulate condition, in a suspension liquid and in<br>
solubilized solution. Therefore it is effectively used<br>
for preventing the peeling off and strengthening of<br>
layering the coating layer and sugar coat layer of<br>
layering and coating tablets which are treated with<br>
components in suspended liquid or solution, and also<br>
sugar coated tablets on which components such as sugar<br>
and calcium carbonate are layered.<br>
[0109]<br>
Next, the usage of a composition containing<br>
one kind or more of the active ingredients and the<br>
porous cellulose aggregate particles will be described.<br>
The compositions that are obtained by the method<br>
described above containing solid, liquid and semisolid<br>
active ingredients and the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles may be used as a solid formulation in powder<br>
or granular conditions, or as coated powder or granular<br><br>
solid formulation by treating the powder or granular<br>
composition with a coating agent. The powder or<br>
granular composition with or without coating may be<br>
used by filling in a capsule or may be used as a tablet<br>
type solid formulation by treating by the compression<br>
compacting procedure. Still further capsules or<br>
tablets may be used after coating.<br>
[0110]<br>

alone or a combination of two kinds or more may be used<br>

[0111]<br><br>
Since the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention have a well developed porous<br>
structure, and the particle itself has a superior<br>
retention capability, the particles that retain a drug<br>
in the pores may be used as it is as fine particles, as<br>
granules after granulation, or these may be compression<br>
molded. These fine particles, granules and tablets may<br>
be further coated thereon. The method of retention is<br>
not particularly restricted if it is a publicly known<br>
method, and may include i) a method which includes<br>
mixing with a drug in a fine particle condition and<br>
retaining in the pores, ii) a method which includes<br>
mixing the porous cellulose aggregates with a drug in a<br>
powder condition under a high shearing and forcefully<br>
retaining them in the pores, iii) a method which<br>
includes mixing the porous cellulose aggregates with a<br>
drug preliminary dissolved or dispersed, retaining them<br>
in the pores and then optionally drying for retention,<br>
iv) a method which includes mixing the porous cellulose<br>
aggregates with a sublimatable drug, and sublimating<br>
and absorbing in the pores by heating and/or reducing<br>
pressure, v) a method include mixing and fusing the<br>
porous cellulose aggregates with a drug before or<br>
during heating and retaining fused materials in the<br>
pores, and any of the above methods may be used alone<br>
or a combination of two kinds or more may be used.<br>
[0112]<br>
Since the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br><br>
present invention have a well developed porous<br>
structure and have a suitable water holding capacity<br>
and oil holding capacity, they can be used not only as<br>
an excipient but also as an core particle for layering<br>
and coating, and in this usage they have an effect for<br>
preventing aggregation among the particles during the<br>
process of layering and coating. The layering and<br>
coating may be a dry method or a wet method.<br>
[0113]<br>
Further, when an active ingredient is a<br>
solution, suspension or emulsion, a method like a<br>
dipping method, which uses the porous cellulose<br>
aggregate particles or a mixture of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregate particles and other additives as a<br>
carrier, may be used which includes immersing in the<br>
solution, suspension or emulsion of the active<br>
ingredient and retaining the active ingredient.<br>
Although it depends on the conditions such as the kind<br>
of the active ingredient and the concentration, even in<br>
the liquid immersion method such as the dipping method,<br>
the uniformity of the active ingredient can be<br>
maintained and it is superior compared to the spray<br>
method described above from the view point of the<br>
simplicity of the process.<br>
Still further, when the active ingredient is<br>
in a solution, suspension or emulsion, a method may be<br>
adopted in which the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles or a mixture of the porous cellulose<br><br>
aggregate particles and the other additives is immersed<br>
as a carrier in the solution, suspension or emulsion of<br>
the active ingredient, and then the dispersion is spray<br>
dried to make a complex.<br>
[0114]<br>
In the porous cellulose aggregate particles<br>
or a mixture of the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles and the other additives before or after the<br>
addition of an active ingredient solution/dispersion,<br>
the respective unit particles may be dispersed<br>
individually or may take a form of aggregated granules.<br>
[0115]<br>
When the production process includes<br>
granulation, the method for granulation includes a dry<br>
granulation, wet granulation, heating granulation,<br>
spray granulation and microcapsulation. More<br>
specifically, among the wet granulation methods,<br>
fluidized bed granulation, stirring granulation,<br>
extrusion granulation, disintegration granulation and<br>
tumbling granulation are effective. In the fluidized<br>
bed granulation method, the granulation is performed in<br>
a fluidized bed granulation device by spraying the<br>
binder solution to fluidized powder. In the stirring<br>
granulation method, mixing, kneading and granulation of<br>
the powder are performed in a closed structure at the<br>
same time by rotating a stirring blade in a mixing<br>
trough while the binding solution is added. In the<br>
extrusion granulation, granulation is performed by<br><br>
forcefully extruding a wet lump that is kneaded by<br>
adding a binder solution through a screen of a suitable<br>
size by means of the screw method or basket method. In<br>
disintegration granulation, granulation is performed by<br>
shearing and disintegrating a wet lump that is kneaded<br>
by adding a binder solution by a rotating blade of a<br>
granulator, and spring granules out of a surrounding<br>
screen by centrifugal force. In tumbling granulation,<br>
spherical granules are tumbled by centrifugal force of<br>
a rotating rotor, and at the same time a binder<br>
solution is sprayed from a spray gun to grow the<br>
particles having a homogeneous particle size like snow<br>
balls.<br>
[0116]<br>
Any of the methods for drying granules such<br>
as a hot air heating type (shelf drying, vacuum drying<br>
and fluidized bed drying), conduction heat type (flat<br>
pan type, shelf box type, drum type) or freeze drying<br>
type may be used. In the hot air heating type, a<br>
material is directly in contact with hot air, and at<br>
the same time evaporated water is removed. In the<br>
conduction heat type, the material is heated indirectly<br>
through a conduction wall. In freeze drying type, the<br>
material is frozen at -10 to -40°C and then water is<br>
removed by sublimation by heating under a high vacuum<br>
(1.3 x 10-5-2.6 x 10-4 MPa) .<br>
[0117]<br>
The methods for compression compacting<br><br>
include, i) a method in which a mixture of an active<br>
ingredient and the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles, or a mixture of one or more groups of active<br>
ingredients and the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles, and optionally other additives is<br>
compression molded by a normal method (direct tablet<br>
pressing method), ii) a method in which after mixing an<br>
active ingredient and the porous cellulose aggregate<br>
particles, and optionally other additives, the mixture<br>
was granulated and the granules are compression molded<br>
by a normal method (wet/dry type granule compression<br>
method), or iii) a method in which an active ingredient<br>
and porous cellulose aggregate particles, and<br>
optionally other additives are mixed, granulated and<br>
further the porous cellulose aggregate particles, and<br>
optionally other additives are added and compression<br>
molded by a normal method (compression compacting after<br>
wet/dry type granulation).<br>
[0118]<br>
A method for adding one or more of active<br>
ingredients, the porous cellulose aggregates, other<br>
additives or granules is not particularly restricted if<br>
it is commonly practiced method, and either the<br>
continuous addition or one time addition may be<br>
performed using a small suction transport device, air<br>
transport device, bucket conveyer, pressure transport<br>
device, vacuum conveyer, quantitative vibration feeder,<br>
spray, funnel and the like.<br><br>
Other than using as tablets after compression<br>
compacting, the composition for tablets of the present<br>
invention may be used as a granular formulation or<br>
powder formulation to improve especially the fluidity,<br>
anti-blocking and anti-coagulation characteristics<br>
because the composition for tablet of the present<br>
invention is superior in retention of solid and liquid<br>
components. Any of the methods for producing granular<br>
formulation and powder formulation, for example, a dry<br>
granulation, wet granulation, heat granulation, spray<br>
drying and microcapsulation may be used.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0119]<br>
The present invention will be described based<br>
on Examples. However, the embodiment of the present<br>
invention is not limited by this description of<br>
Examples. In addition, the methods for measurement and<br>
evaluation of each physical property in Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples are as follows.<br>
[0120]<br>
(1) Average width (|om) of primary cellulose<br>
particles<br>
Primary cellulose particles consisting of a<br>
natural cellulose substance was optionally dried,<br>
placed on a sample platform covered with a carbon tape,<br>
vacuum coated with platinum/palladium (thickness of<br>
vapor deposited film is 20 nm or less), and observed<br><br>
using JSM-5510V (Commercial Name) made by JASCO<br>
Corporation, at an acceleration voltage of 6 kV at a<br>
magnification of x250. The average of three<br>
representative primary cellulose particles was<br>
calculated.<br>
[0121]<br>
(2)	Average thickness (|im) of primary cellulose<br>
particles<br>
Primary cellulose particles consisting of a<br>
natural cellulose substance was optionally dried,<br>
placed on a sample platform covered with a carbon tape,<br>
vacuum coated with gold, and then a cross section of a<br>
primary cellulose particle was excised by Ga ion beam<br>
using a converging ion beam manufacturing apparatus<br>
(Hitachi, Ltd. FB-2100 (Commercial Name)) and observed<br>
at an acceleration voltage of 6 kV at a magnification<br>
of xl500. The average of three representative primary<br>
cellulose particles was calculated.<br>
[0122]<br>
(3)	Amount (% by weight) of particles that are<br>
not precipitated under centrifugal condition of<br>
centrifugal force of 4900 m/s2<br>
A cellulose dispersion before drying was<br>
accurately weighed (A(g)) in a centrifuge tube (50 ml<br>
capacity) and adjusted to about 1% cellulose<br>
concentration by adding pure water. The cellulose<br>
dispersion before drying was weighed so that the weight<br>
after the adjustment was about 30 g. The centrifuge<br><br>
tube containing the cellulose dispersion of about 1%<br>
concentration was placed in an inverter-multi purpose<br>
high speed refrigerated centrifuge (Type 6930, KUBOTA<br>
Corporation, Rapid was used as a mode for acceleration<br>
and deceleration) and a RA-400 angle rotor (volume: 50<br>
cm3, material: polypropylene co-polymer, tube angle:<br>
35°, the maximum radius: 10.5 cm, the minimum radius:<br>
5.8 cm, rotation rate: 4100 rpm) and centrifuged at a<br>
centrifugal force of 4900 m/s2, in the temperature range<br>
of 15-25°C for 10 minutes. After the centrifugation,<br>
the supernatant was transferred to a weighing vial,<br>
dried at 110°C for 5 hours, and the weight of the solid<br>
cellulose after drying was measured (B(g)). In<br>
addition, the cellulose dispersion was weighed<br>
separately in the range of 2-5 g, dried at 110°C for 5<br>
hours and the weight of the solid after drying was<br>
measured (C (%)) .<br>
The amount of particles that are not<br>
precipitated under centrifugal condition of centrifugal<br>
force of 4900 m/s2, D (% by weight), was calculated from<br>
the following formula.<br>
D (% by weight) = {B(g)/[A(g) x (C(%)/100)]} x 100<br>
[0123]<br>
(4) Average particle size (µm) of cellulose<br>
dispersion<br>
The average particle size was expressed as a<br><br>
cumulative volume 50% particle by measuring the<br>
cellulose dispersed in water using a laser diffraction<br>
particle size distribution analyzer (HORIBA, LA-910<br>
(Commercial Name)) after ultrasonic treatment of one<br>
minute, at refractive index of 1.20. However, this<br>
measurement does not necessarily correlate to the<br>
particle size distribution of dried particles obtained<br>
by the Ro-tap method described below because of<br>
entirely different principle of measurement. The<br>
average particle size measured by the laser diffraction<br>
is obtained from the volume frequency that is dependent<br>
on the major axis of the fibrous particle, while the<br>
average particle size obtained by the Ro-tap method is<br>
dependent on the minor axis of the fibrous particle<br>
because the fractionation is performed by shaking the<br>
obtained powder on a sieve. Therefore, the laser<br>
diffraction method that depends on the major axis of<br>
the fibrous particle sometimes produces larger figures<br>
than that of the Ro-tap method that depends on the<br>
minor axis of the fibrous particle.<br>
[0124]<br>
(5)	Crystalline form<br>
An X ray diffraction analysis was conducted<br>
by an X ray diffract meter and the crystalline form was<br>
determined from the X ray pattern.<br>
(6)	Average particle size (µm) of dried<br>
particles.<br>
The average particle size of powder sample<br><br>
was measured using a Ro-tap sieve shake (Taira<br>
Kosakusho Ltd., Sieve Shaker A type (Commercial Name)),<br>
and JIS standard sieve (Z8801-1987) by sieving 10 g of<br>
the sample for 10 minutes and expressed as the<br>
accumulated weight 50% particle size.<br>
(7)	Specific surface area (m2/g)<br>
The measurement was made by the BET method<br>
using a TriSTAR (Micrometrics Co., Commercial Name) and<br>
nitrogen as an absorbing gas. About one gram of each<br>
sample was placed in a cell and measured. Each sample<br>
powder used for the measurement had been dried at 110°C<br>
for 3 hours under reduced pressure.<br>
[0125]<br>
(8)	Intraparticular pore volume (cm3/g) and median<br>
pore diameter (µm)<br>
Pore size distribution was obtained by the<br>
mercury porosimetry using an autopore type 9520<br>
(Commercial Name, made by Shimadzu Corporation). Each<br>
sample powder used for the measurement had been dried<br>
at room temperature for 15 hours under reduced<br>
pressure. From the pore size distribution obtained by<br>
the measurement at the initial pressure of 20 kPa, "the<br>
clear peak area" in the range of pore diameter of 0.1-<br>
15 µm was calculated as the intraparticular pore<br>
volume. Further the peak top of "the clear peak"<br>
observed in the range of pore diameter of 0.1-15 µm was<br>
regarded as the median pore diameter from the obtained<br>
pore size distribution and the value was recorded.<br><br>
[0126]<br>
(9)	Apparent specific volume (cm3/g)<br>
The powder sample was poured into a 100 cm3<br>
measuring cylinder using a quantitative feeder or the<br>
like in 2-3 minutes and the top layer of the powder<br>
sample was made flat using a soft brush and the volume<br>
was read. The apparent specific volume was obtained by<br>
dividing this volume with the weight of the powder<br>
sample. The weight of the powder sample was suitably<br>
set so that the volume was 70-100 cm3.<br>
[0127]<br>
(10)	Observation of the particle surface and pores<br>
by SEM<br>
Each cellulose sample was placed on a sample<br>
platform covered with a carbon tape and vacuum coated<br>
with platinum/palladium (thickness of vapor deposited<br>
film is 20 nm or less), and observed using JSM-5510V<br>
(Commercial Name) made by JASCO Corporation, at an<br>
acceleration voltage of 6 kV at a magnification of<br>
x250-xl500. A sample was regarded O when it has a<br>
secondary aggregated particle structure consisting of<br>
continuously aggregated primary particles, in which the<br>
boundary between the primary particles were clear and<br>
the confirmable median pore diameter was 0.1 urn or<br>
above. A sample having a structure other than that was<br>
regarded X.<br>
[0128]<br>
(11)	Disintegration of cellulose particles in<br><br>
water<br>
Each cellulose sample of 0.1 g was placed in<br>
a glass test tube, mixed with 10 g of pure water and<br>
treated with ultrasonic for 1 minute. Observations<br>
were made using a microscope (Made by Keyence<br>
Corporation, VH-7000 (Commercial name)) with or with<br>
our ultrasonic treatment, and the presence or absence<br>
of particle disintegration was monitored. The sample<br>
in which disintegration was observed was O and not<br>
observed was x.<br>
[0129]<br>
(12) Reactivity to a drug<br>
Aspirin (Japanese Pharmacopeia crystalline<br>
aspirin was treated with a small grinder Φ0.5 mm, with 1<br>
pass treatment) and each cellulose sample was mixed at<br>
5/5 (total 0.5 g) in dry conditions and then placed in<br>
a glass sample vial and mixed. The vial was stored in<br>
an oven (Made by Tabai Espec Corp. Perfect Oven<br>
(Commercial Name)) with the cap tightly closed (at 60°C)<br>
for two weeks and then the decomposition rate was<br>
measured. Ferric (III) sodium sulfate 12 hydrate 8 g<br>
was placed in a 100 ml measuring flask, mixed with pure<br>
water to bring the volume up to 100 ml to make a<br>
coloring test solution. 0.25 g of stored aspirin<br>
(total 0.5 g of the blended powder) was introduced to a<br>
50 ml measuring flask, mixed with ethanol to bring the<br>
volume up to 50 ml and the mixture was shaken for 5<br>
minutes. Thus obtained ethanol solution was filtered,<br><br>
the filtrate was transferred to a 100 ml measuring<br>
flask and ethanol was added to bring the volume up to<br>
100 ml. One milliliter of this ethanol solution and 1<br>
ml of the coloring test solution described above were<br>
introduced to a 50 ml measuring flask, mixed with pure<br>
water to bring the volume up to 50 ml and the<br>
absorption was measured at the wavelength of 532 nm<br>
using a UV absorption meter (made by JASCO<br>
Corporation). The decomposition rate was calculated<br>
from the following formula.<br>
Decomposition rate (%) = (1-(absorption after<br>
the storage/absorption before the storage)) x 100<br>
The sample showing a decomposition rate over<br>
15%, which is the decomposition rate of aspirin alone<br>
was judged to be reactive.<br>
[0130]<br>
(13)	Repose angle (°)<br>
Using a Sugihara type repose angle measuring<br>
device (slit size: depth 10 mm x width 50 mm x height<br>
140 mm, a protractor was placed at the position of 50<br>
mm width), the dynamic self-fluidity was measured when<br>
cellulose powder was dropped to the slit at 3 g/minute<br>
using a quantitative feeder. The angle between the<br>
bottom of the device and the top layer of the cellulose<br>
powder is the repose angle.<br>
(14)	Swelling degree<br><br>
The swelling degree was obtained from the<br>
volume (V1) of about 10 g of powder which was slowly<br>
poured into a cylindrical container having 100 cm3<br>
capacity and the volume (V2) of the same powder when<br>
about 50 cm3 of pure water was added to the powder and<br>
the result is mixed so that the powder was thoroughly<br>
wetted and then left standing for 8 hours, by the<br>
following formula.<br>
Swelling degree (%) = (V2-V1) /V1 x 100<br>
[0131]<br>
(14)	Compression compacting of a cellulose sample<br>
alone<br>
0.5 g of each cellulose powder was weighed,<br>
placed in a die (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, Material SUS2,<br>
3 were used), compressed with a circular flat punch<br>
with a diameter of 1.1 cm (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD,<br>
Material SUS2, 3 were used) until the pressure of 10<br>
MPa and 20 MPa was attained (AIKOH ENGINEERING CO.,<br>
LTD. PCM-1A was used. The compression rate was 1<br>
cm/minute), and held at the target pressure for 10<br>
seconds, and then a cylindrical molded body was taken<br>
out.<br>
[0132]<br>
(15)	Rotary tablet pressing of the formulated<br>
powder<br>
55 weight parts of acetaminophen (API<br><br>
Corporation, powder type), 0.25 weight parts of light<br>
anhydrous silicic acid (Nippon NIPPON AEROSIL CO.,<br>
LTD., Commercial name: Aerosil 200), 27 weight parts of<br>
cellulose particles of powder obtained in Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples, two weight parts of crospovidone<br>
(BASF, Commercial name: Collidone CL) and 15 weight<br>
parts of granular lactose (Lactose New Zealand,<br>
Commercial Name: Super-Tab) were placed in a 100 L<br>
scale V Type Mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd.) and mixed for 30<br>
minutes, and then 0.5 weight parts of magnesium<br>
stearate (TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD., Plant<br>
origin) was added and mixed for further 5 minutes to<br>
obtain the formulated powder. Here the total amount of<br>
input powders was 25 kg. Thus obtained formulated<br>
powder was subjected to tablet pressing using a rotary<br>
tablet press (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, Commercial name:<br>
LIBRA-II, 36 lines, Rotary table Φ410 mm) and the<br>
formulated powder was supplied by a stirring feeder.<br>
Tablet pressing was performed using a punch with 8 mm<br>
diameter and 12 R, at a turn table speed of 50 rpm, at<br>
a compression force of 7.5 kN to obtain tablets<br>
weighing 200 mg each.<br>
[0133]<br>
(16) Variation of tablet mass (%)<br>
Twenty tablets obtained by the rotary tablet<br>
pressing were weighed, and the average weight and the<br>
standard deviation of the weight were calculated, and<br>
the variation of the mass was evaluated from the<br><br>
variation coefficient defined by the formula (standard<br>
deviation/average weight) x 100. The smaller is the<br>
variation coefficient, the smaller is the variation.<br>
[0134]<br>
(17)	Tablet hardness (N)<br>
Using a Schleuniger hardness tester (Freund<br>
Corporation 6D type (Commercial Name)), a cylindrical<br>
molded body or a tablet was subjected to a load from<br>
the direction of the diameter until destroyed and the<br>
load at this time was measured. The hardness was<br>
expressed as an average of 10 samples.<br>
[0135]<br>
(18)	Disintegration time (second)<br>
The disintegration test was conducted<br>
according to the tablet disintegration test method, in<br>
the general test method of the 14th edition of the<br>
Japanese Pharmacopeia. For a cylindrical molded body<br>
or a tablet the disintegration time was obtained in<br>
pure water at 37°C using a disintegration tester (Toyama<br>
Sangyo Co., Ltd., NT-40HS type (Commercial Name), in<br>
the case of cellulose alone: with disc; in the case of<br>
the formulation: without disc). The disintegration<br>
time was expressed as the average of 6 samples.<br>
[0136]<br>
(19)	Tablet friability (% by weight)<br>
Twenty tablets were weighed (Wa), placed in a<br>
friability tester (Japan Machinery Company, PTF-3RA<br>
type (Commercial Name)), rotated at 25 rpm for 4<br><br>
minutes, and then fine powder attached to the tablets<br>
was removed. The weight (Wb) of the tablets was<br>
measured again and the friability was calculated from<br>
the following formula.<br>
Friability = 100 x (Wa-Wb)/Wa<br>
[0137]<br>
(20)	Incidence of tablet pressing problems (%)<br>
One hundred tablets obtained by a rotary<br>
tablet press were randomly selected and subjected to<br>
visual inspection. The number of tablets with<br>
splitting (lamination), breaking off (chipping) and<br>
peeling off (capping) was counted, and the total number<br>
of these tablets was divided by the number of the<br>
inspected tablets to obtain the%.<br>
(21)	Level-off polymerization degree of wood pulp<br>
Ten grams of wood pulp was shredded,<br>
hydrolyzed under the condition of 2.5 N hydrochloric<br>
acid, at a boiling temperature for 15 minutes and then<br>
purified. The dried powder thus obtained was subjected<br>
to measurement according to the viscosity method<br>
(copper ethylenediamine method) described in the<br>
crystalline cellulose confirmation test (13) of the 13th<br>
edition of the Japanese Pharmacopeia to obtain the<br>
polymerization degree.<br>
(22)	Whiteness of wood pulp<br>
This value is measured according to ISO<br><br>
(filter R4 57). The measurement was made by a color<br>
difference meter using a blue filter regarding the<br>
perfect white as 100%. The degree of whiteness was<br>
defined as a reflection rate at a transmission central<br>
wavelength of 457 µm.<br>
(22) S10, S18 of wood pulp<br>
A value measured according to Tappi T253m-60.<br>
S10:<br>
100 cm3 of 10% NaOH was placed in a glass<br>
container, cooled to 20°C for 30 minutes, and 1.6 g of<br>
shredded pulp (dry weight is G) was added and immersed<br>
well in alkali. The mixture was then stirred at 2300-<br>
2800 rpm to dissolve the pulp completely. After<br>
cooling the glass container with water, 10 cm3 of 0.4 N<br>
potassium dichromate and 30 cm3 of concentrated sulfuric<br>
acid were added to 10 cm3 of the filtered solution, and<br>
then 100 cm3 of pure water was added and the mixture<br>
cooled in water for 30 minutes. After adding 10 cm3 of<br>
10% KI and standing, the mixture was titrated with 0.1<br>
N sodium thiosulfate. The volume of sodium thiosulfate<br>
at the endpoint was A (cm3) . For 10 cm3 of 10% NaOH<br>
before adding pulp, the titration described above was<br>
performed. The volume of sodium thiosulfate at the<br>
endpoint was B (cm3) . S10 is calculated from the<br>
following formula.<br>
S10 (%) = (B-A) x 0.685/G<br>
G = weight of pulp x (100-water content of pulp)/100<br><br>
The water content of pulp is calculated by drying the<br>
pulp at 125°C for 1.5 hours.<br>
S10:<br>
Was measured according to the same method as<br>
S10 except that 18% NaOH was used.<br>

Two kg of shredded commercially available<br>
pulp (natural cellulose dissolved pulp derived from<br>
wood, average polymerization degree: 1030, average<br>
fiber width of the primary cellulose particles: about<br>
39 µm, average thickness: about 8 µm) was immersed in<br>
water and, under the condition of containing about 70%<br>
water, passed through a cutter mill (URSCHEL<br>
LABORATORIES, INC. "Comitrol" (Commercial Name), Model<br>
1700, Microhead/blade gap: 2.029 mm, Immpeler rotation<br>
rate: 9000 rpm) and mixed with pure water to prepare a<br>
cellulose dispersion of about 2% concentration, which<br>
was treated twice with a high pressure homogenizer<br>
(MFIC Corp. Commercial Name "Microfluidizer" M-140K<br>
type, Process pressure: 200 MPa) and then centrifuged<br>
at a centrifugal force of 19600 m/s2 to obtain the<br>
precipitates after discarding the supernatant. The<br>
precipitates were dried at 40°C for 16 hours, and about<br>
2 kg of the dried precipitates and 30 L of 4 N<br>
hydrochloric acid solution were placed in a low speed<br>
stirrer (Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd., 50LGL Reactor<br><br>
(Commercial Name)). Hydrolysis was performed at 40°C<br>
for 48 hours while stirring to obtain an acid insoluble<br>
residue. After sufficient washing with pure water, the<br>
acid insoluble residue thus obtained was filtered,<br>
introduced to a 90 L polyethylene bucket, mixed with<br>
pure water to bring the concentration of the total<br>
solid fraction to 20% by weight and neutralized with<br>
ammonia water while stirring with a 3-1 motor (pH after<br>
neutralization was 7.5-8.0). The average fiber width<br>
of the primary cellulose particles in this cellulose<br>
dispersion containing 20% by weight of the solid<br>
fraction was about 19 µm, average thickness was about<br>
3µm and average particle size was 38 µm. This<br>
cellulose dispersion was spray dried (dispersion supply<br>
rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet temperature: 180-220°C, outlet<br>
temperature: 50-70°C) to obtain the cellulose particle A<br>
that is the cellulose aggregate. The physical<br>
properties of the cellulose particle A are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
[0139]<br>
Fig. 1 shows the results of the measurement<br>
of the pore size distribution of the cellulose particle<br>
A by the mercury porosimetry, and Fig. 6 shows an<br>
electron micrograph of the cross section of the<br>
cellulose particle A. As shown in Fig. 1, in the<br>
cellulose particle A, a "clear peak" that was derived<br>
from the intraparticular pores was confirmed in the<br>
range of 0.1-15 µm. This is about the same size as the<br><br>
pore size shown in the electron micrograph by SEM. In<br>
addition, the peak shown in the range of 10-50 µm in<br>
Fig. 1 is derived from the gap between particles. As<br>
shown in Fig. 6, the development of the intraparticular<br>
pores having the pore diameter that corresponded to the<br>
"clear peak" shown in Fig. 1 was also observed.<br>

acid insoluble residue thus obtained was filtered,<br>
introduced to a 90 L polyethylene bucket, mixed with<br>
pure water to bring the concentration of the total<br>
solid fraction to 15% by weight and neutralized with<br>
ammonia water while stirring with a 3-1 motor (pH after<br>
neutralization was 7.5-8.0). The average fiber width<br>
of the primary cellulose particles in this cellulose<br><br>

average fiber width of the primary cellulose particles:<br>
about 39 µm, average thickness: about 8 µm) and 30 L of<br>
0.14 N hydrochloric acid solution were placed in a low<br>
speed stirrer (Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd., 50LGL<br>
Reactor (Commercial Name)). Hydrolysis was performed<br>
at 121°C for 1 hour while stirring to obtain an acid<br>

water, the acid insoluble residue thus obtained was<br>
filtered, introduced to a 90 L polyethylene bucket,<br>
mixed with pure water to bring the concentration of the<br>
total solid fraction to 17% by weight and neutralized<br>
with ammonia water while stirring with a 3-1 motor (pH<br>

cellulose dispersion containing 17% by weight of the<br><br>
solid fraction was about 39 µm, average thickness was<br>
about 8 µm and average particle size was 36 µm. This<br>
cellulose dispersion was spray dried (dispersion supply<br>
rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet temperature: 180-220°C, outlet<br>
temperature: 50-70°C) to obtain the cellulose<br>
aggregates. These cellulose aggregates were milled<br>
using a jet mill (SEISHIN ENTERPRISE CO., LTD., Single<br>
Track Jet Mill STJ-200 (Commercial Name)) to obtain<br>
cellulose powder F (corresponding to Example 1 of<br>
Patent Document 6). The physical properties of the<br>
cellulose particle F thus obtained are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
Results of the SEM observation of cellulose<br>
powder B indicated that the particles did not have<br>
intraparticular pores, the primary particles existed<br>
alone without having the secondary aggregate structure<br>
and that no disintegration of the particles in water<br>
was observed.<br>
[0141]<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
The similar operations were performed as<br>
Comparative Example 1 except that the hydrolysis<br>
condition was 3N hydrochloric acid solution, at 40°C,<br>
for 40 hours and drying at the concentration of the<br>
solid 8% to obtain cellulose powder G (corresponding to<br>
Example 5 of Patent document 9). The physical<br>
properties of the cellulose powder G thus obtained are<br>
shown in Table 1. The average fiber width of the<br><br>
primary cellulose particles in the cellulose dispersion<br>
before drying was 39 µm, the average thickness was 8 µm<br>
and the average particle size was 47 µm.<br>
[01421<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
The similar operations were performed as<br>
Comparative Example 1 except that the hydrolysis<br>
condition was 3 N hydrochloric acid solution, at 40°C,<br>
for 20 hours and drying at the concentration of the<br>
solid fraction of 6% to obtain cellulose powder H<br>
(corresponding to Example 7 of Patent Document 9). The<br>
physical properties of the cellulose powder H thus<br>

by the mercury porosimtry. For the cellulose powder H<br>
no "clear peak" like the one seen in the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of Example 1 was confirmed. Such<br>
pores having no "clear peak" are intrinsic to the<br>
original primary cellulose particles. Still further,<br>
considering the distribution of the particle size of<br>
the powder, the peak seen in the range of 10-50 µm was<br>
derived from the gap between particles.<br>
[0143]<br><br>
average fiber width of the primary cellulose particles:<br>

concentration of the total solid fraction to 15% by<br>
weight and neutralized with ammonia water while<br>
stirring with a 3-1 motor (pH after neutralization was<br>
7.5-8.0). The average fiber width of the primary<br>

FMC Co., Ltd., product "Abicel" PH-200 was<br>
assigned to be the cellulose powder J. The physical<br>

[0145]<br>
(Comparative Example 6)<br>
The cellulose aggregates obtained in<br>
Comparative Example 1 and acetaminophen, Japanese<br>
Pharmacopeia (MERCK HOEI CO., LTD.) milled using a<br>
bantam mill (Made by Hosokawa Tekkosho, screen size: 2<br>
mm) were introduced to a high speed stirring granulator<br>
(made by GOKYO SEISAKUSHO CO., LTD., NSK250 (Commercial<br>
Name)) in a composition of cellulose 50% by weight and<br><br>
acetaminophen 50% by weight, total 500 g of the powder<br>
mixture, mixed well by rotating a stirring blade at 500<br>
rpm for 1 minute, further mixed for 2 minutes while<br>
adding 245-255 g of 50% by weight ethanol solution to<br>
obtain spherical granules. The granules thus obtained<br>
were dried at 50°C for 12 hours, and then after 12 mesh<br>
or larger fractions were discarded as coarse large<br>
particles, acetaminophen was extracted with acetone for<br>
20 hours using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus. This<br>
was again dried at 50°C for 12 hours to obtain the<br>
cellulose powder K (corresponding to Example 2 of<br>
Patent Document 2). The physical properties of the<br>
cellulose powder K thus obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0146]<br>
Fig. 3 shows an electron micrograph of the<br>
cellulose particle K at a magnification of x250 and<br>
Fig. 5 shows an electron micrograph at a magnification<br>
of xl500.<br>
In the cellulose powder K, a "clear peak" was<br>
confirmed in the range of 0.1-10 µm of the pore size<br>
distribution from the results of the measurement of the<br>
pore size distribution by the mercury porosimetry.<br>
However, the electron microgram (Figs. 3 and 5) by SEM<br>
confirmed that the particle structure was not the<br>
"secondary aggregate structure of the aggregation of<br>
the primary particles" but the "dense homogeneously<br>
continuous film like septum structure". From Figs. 3<br>
and 5, it is seen that the primary cellulose particles<br><br>
became microfine particles which bound tightly each<br>
other in drying process forming the "dense<br>
homogeneously continuous film like septum structure"<br>
resulting in that boundaries between the primary<br>
particles became unclear. In addition, the particles<br>
did not disintegrate in water. Furthermore, the<br>
cylindrical molded body (compression pressure 10 MPa)<br>
obtained from the cellulose particle K was very much<br>
fragile and friable.<br>
[0147]<br>
(Comparative Example 7)<br>
A commercially available dissolved pulp was<br>
shredded and hydrolyzed in 7% hydrochloric acid<br>
solution at 105°C for 20 minutes, and a wet cake was<br>
obtained by neutralizing, washing, filtering and<br>
dehydrating thus obtained acid insoluble residue. The<br>
wet cake (water content: 50% by weight) was dispersed<br>
in isopropyl alcohol and subjected to two cycles of<br>
filtration, dehydration and re-dispersion, and further<br>
subjected to the dispersion treatment three times using<br>
a Manton-Goring homogenizer (made by NIHONSEIKI K7AISHA<br>
LTD. Type 15M (Commercial Name)) at a treatment<br>
pressure of 400 kg/cm2 to obtain a cellulose dispersion<br>
having the solid fraction concentration of 9.8% by<br>
weight, water content of 2.5 weigh%, isopropyl alcohol<br>
of 87.7% by weight. The average particle size of the<br>
primary cellulose particles of the cellulose dispersion<br>
having the solid fraction concentration of 9.8% by<br><br>
weight was 1 µm. This cellulose dispersion was spray<br>
dried using a nitrogen circulating type spray dryer.<br>
The sample thus obtained was sieved through a JIS<br>
standard sieve to cut off the coarse fraction of 250 µm<br>
or above to obtain the cellulose powder L<br>
(corresponding to Example 2 of Patent Document 3). The<br>
physical properties of the cellulose powder L thus<br>
obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
In the cellulose particle L, a "clear peak"<br>
was confirmed at 0.1 µm or below from the results of<br>
the measurement of the pore size distribution by the<br>
mercury porosimetry. Also, the electron microgram by<br>
SEM confirmed that the particle structure was not the<br>
"secondary aggregate structure of the aggregation of<br>
the primary particles" but the "dense homogeneously<br>
continuous film like septum structure". The boundaries<br>
between the primary particles were unclear in the<br>
septa. The particles did not disintegrate in water,<br>
and the aspirin decomposition rate was higher than that<br>
of the drug alone.<br>
[0148]<br>
(Comparative Example 8)<br>
Two kilograms of shredded commercially<br>
available pulp (natural cellulose dissolved pulp<br>
derived from wood, average polymerization degree: 1030,<br>
average fiber width of the primary cellulose particles:<br>
about 39 µm, average thickness: about 8 µm) and 30 L of<br>
0.14 N hydrochloric acid solution were placed in a low<br><br>
speed stirrer (Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd., 50LGL<br>
Reactor (Commercial Name)). Hydrolysis was performed<br>
at 121°C for 1 hour while stirring to obtain an acid<br>
insoluble residue. After sufficient washing with pure<br>
water, the acid insoluble residue thus obtained was<br>
filtered, introduced to a 90 L polyethylene bucket,<br>
mixed with pure water to bring the concentration of the<br>
total solid fraction to 17% by weight and neutralized<br>
with ammonia water while stirring with a 3-1 motor (pH<br>
after neutralization was 7.5-8.0). The average fiber<br>
width of the primary cellulose particles in this<br>
cellulose dispersion containing 17% by weight of the<br>
solid fraction was about 39 µm, average thickness was<br>
about 8 µm and average particle size was 36 µm. This<br>
cellulose dispersion was spray dried (dispersion supply-<br>
rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet temperature: 180-220°C, outlet<br>
temperature: 50-70°C) to obtain the cellulose powder M<br>
(corresponding to Example of Patent Document 4).<br>
[0149]<br>
The physical properties of the cellulose<br>
powder M are shown in Table 1. Also an electron<br>
micrograph of the cellulose powder M at a magnification<br>
x250 is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
From Fig. 4, it is seen that the particle<br>
structure of the cellulose powder M is the "secondary<br>
aggregate structure of the aggregation of the primary<br>
particles". However, since this is the product of<br>
drying the dispersion of the cellulose particles having<br><br>
a single average particle size, the intracellular pore<br>
volume is small, and no clear peak was observed in the<br>
range of 0.1-10 µm in the pore size distribution from<br>
the results of the measurement of the pore size<br>
distribution by the mercury porosimetry.<br>
Further, Fig. 7 is a cross section view of<br>
the particle of the cellulose powder M by an electron<br>
microscope, and a tightly bound structure can be<br>
confirmed that was formed by the stiff binding of the<br>
cellulose particles. The intraparticular pores were<br>
sparse and not well developed and the pore volume<br>
measured by the mercury porosimetry is also small.<br>
[0150]<br>
(Comparative Example 9)<br>
Two kilograms of a commercially available<br>
kraft pulp was shredded and hydrolyzed in 0.7% by<br>
weight hydrochloric acid aqueous solution at 125°C for<br>
150 minutes, and the acid insoluble residue thus<br>
obtained was filtered and neutralized. The wet flock<br>
thus obtained was sufficiently pulverized in a kneader,<br>
mixed with an equal volume of ethanol, pressed and<br>
filtered and air dried.<br>
The average fiber width of the primary<br>
cellulose particle in cellulose water/ethanol<br>
dispersion before drying was 31 µm, the average<br>
thickness was 8 µm and average particle size was 28 µm.<br>
After air drying, it was milled by a normal hammer<br>
mill, and the coarse fraction was removed by sieving<br><br>
through a 40 mesh sieve to obtain the cellulose powder<br>
N (corresponding to Example 1 of Patent Document 5).<br>
The various physical properties of the cellulose powder<br>
N thus obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0151]<br>
(Comparative Example 10)<br>
A commercially available dissolved pulp was<br>
shredded and hydrolized in 10% by weight hydrochloric<br>
acid aqueous solution at 105°C for 30 minutes. The<br>
obtained acid insoluble residue was filtered, washed,<br>
and neutralized to obtain a dispersion with a solid<br>
fraction concentration of 17% by weight. The primary<br>
cellulose particles in the cellulose dispersion had an<br>
average fiber width of 39 µm, an average thickness of 8<br>
µm, and an average particle size of 33 µm. The<br>
obtained cellulose dispersion was dried with a drum<br>
drier (product name KDD-1 from Kusunoki Kikai<br>
Seisakusho Co., Ltd. at a steam pressure of 0.35 MPa, a<br>
drum temperature of 136°C, a drum speed of 2 rprr., and<br>
reservoir dispersion temperature of 100°C). This was<br>
then crushed with a hammer mill and bulk particles were<br>
removed with a sieve having a mesh size of 425 µm,<br>
providing a Cellulose Powder 0 (corresponds to Example<br>
1 in Patent Document 7). Various properties of the<br>
obtained Cellulose Powder 0 are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0152]<br>
(Comparative Example 11)<br>
An airjet sieve was used on the Cellulose<br><br>
Powder K obtained from Comparative Example 10 and large<br>
particles were removed with a 75 µm sieve and fine<br>
particles were removed with a 38 µm sieve. This<br>
provided the Cellulose Powder P (corresponds to the<br>
Example of Patent Document 8). Various physical<br>
properties of the obtained Cellulose Powder P are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
[0153]<br>
(Comparative Example 12)<br>
A high-speed stirrer and granulator (model<br>
FS-10 (Commercial Name) from Fukae Industries Co.,<br>
Ltd.) was used with 1.5 kg of Cellulose Powder M<br>
obtained from Comparative Example 8 and 1.5 kg of<br>
distilled water was added. Kneading was performed for<br>
5 minutes. The Marumerizer Q-230 (Commercial Name,<br>
Fuji Paudal Co., Ltd.) was used on 1.0 kg of the wet<br>
powder to form spheres by rolling for 10 minutes at 500<br>
rpm. At the same time, 200 g of distilled water was<br>
added at a rate of 20 g/min. Then, the powder was left<br>
out overnight at 40°C to dry, after which a 16 mesh (1<br>
mm mesh size) was used to obtain spherical particles Q<br>
(corresponds to Example 1 of Patent Document 12). The<br>
various physical properties of the obtained spherical<br>
particles are shown in Table 1.<br>
The cellulose spherical particles Q are<br>
extremely heavy and provide superior fluidity, but<br>
there was almost no specific surface area or<br>
intraparticular pore volume. A molded body could not<br><br>
be formed under standard compression pressures of 10,<br>
20 MPa.<br>
[0154]<br>
(Comparative Example 13)<br>
As in Example 1, a commercially available<br>
kraft pulp was shredded and hydrolized in a 10% by<br>
weight of hydrochloric acid aqueous solution at 105°C<br>
for 30 minutes. The obtained acid insoluble residue<br>
was filtered to obtain a crystal cellulose cake with a<br>
solid concentration of 40% (the degree of<br>
polymerization of the cake was 153). The cake was<br>
ground for 1 hour with an all-purpose mixer/stirrer<br>
(model number 5DM-03-R (Commercial Name) from San-Ei<br>
Seisakusho, Ltd.). Water was added to the ground cake<br>
and a homogenizing mixer (model number TK Homomixer<br>
Mark II from Tokushu kika Kogyo) was used to form a<br>
12.5% by weight of solid content cellulose dispersion<br>
with adjustments made for particle size, pH, and IC.<br>
The primary cellulose particles in the resulting<br>
cellulose dispersion had an average particle size of 7<br>
µm. The dispersion was spray dried using a turntable<br>
of approximately 8 cm at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm,<br>
a flow rate of 6 L/hr, an intake temperature of 170°C,<br>
and an outlet temperature of 85°C. Large particles were<br>
removed with a sieve having a mesh size of 177 µm to<br>
obtain a cellulose powder R. The various physical<br>
properties of the obtained cellulose particle R<br>
(corresponds to Example 1 of Patent Document 14) are<br><br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
The cellulose particles R are also heavy and<br>
have superior fluidity but specific surface area and<br>
intraparticular pore volume are low. While a molded<br>
body could be formed under standard compression<br>
pressures of 10, 20 MPa, the molded body was fragile,<br>
with friability taking place upon release. The molded<br>
body could be easily destroyed by hand.<br>
[0155]<br>
(Comparative Example 14)<br>
A low-speed stirrer (30LGL reactor from<br>
Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd., approximately 30 cm<br>
blade diameter) was used with 2 kg of shredded<br>
commercially available pulp (with a degree of<br>
polymerization of 790) and 30 L of 4 N aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid. Hydrolization was performed for 48<br>
hours at 40°C while stirring at a stirring speed of 5<br>
rpm, resulting in acid insoluble residue with an<br>
average polymerization degree of 270. The obtained<br>
acid insoluble residue was filtered to a solid<br>
concentration of 40% using a suction funnel. The<br>
filtered residue was then washed with pure water and<br>
neutralized with ammonia water. This was placed in a<br>
90 L polyethylene bucket. Pure water was added and the<br>
result was stirred at a stirring speed of 5 rpm using a<br>
3-1 motor (type 1200G from Heidon, 8 M/M, average blade<br>
diameter 5 cm). This provided a cellulose dispersion<br>
with a solid concentration of 22%. The primary<br><br>
cellulose particles in the cellulose dispersion had an<br>
average fiber width of 39 µm, an average thickness of 8<br>
µm, and an average particle size of 54 µm. This was<br>
spray dried (dispersion supply rate: 6 L/hr, inlet<br>
temperature: 180-220°C, outlet temperature: 50-70°C),<br>
resulting in a cellulose powder S. The various<br>
physical properties of the obtained cellulose particles<br>
S (corresponds to Example 2 of Patent Document 10) are<br>
shown in Table 1. While the cellulose particles S<br>
provided a high degree of hardness in the molded body<br>
at 10, 20 MPa, the apparent specific volume was too<br>
high, resulting in inferior fluidity (repose angle) and<br>
disintegration property.<br>
(Comparative Example 15)<br>
A low-speed stirrer (30LGL reactor<br>
(Commercial Name) from Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd.)<br>
was used with 2 kg of shredded commercial by available<br>
pulp (a natural cellulose dissolved pulp derived from<br>
wood) and 30 L of 4 N aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
Hydrolization was performed for 48 hours at 40°C while<br>
stirring, resulting in acid insoluble residue. After<br>
thoroughly washing the obtained acid insoluble residue<br>
in pure water, the residue was filtered, resulting in a<br>
wet flock (the average particle size of the dispersed<br>
cellulose particles in the acid insoluble residue was<br>
55 µm. ) Of the obtained wet flock, 60% by weight was<br>
further washed thoroughly with pure water, neutralized,<br>
refiltered, and air dried to produce a dried flock.<br><br>
This dried flock was shredded with a home mixer and<br>
then further crushed with a jet mill (single-track jet<br>
mill STJ-200 from SEISHIN ENTERPRISE CO., LTD.) to<br>
obtain a crushed product (the cellulose particle size<br>
was 3 µm. The obtained crushed product and the wet<br>
acid insoluble residue described above were placed in a<br>
90 L polyethylene bucket at a composition of 60 parts<br>
by weight to 40 parts by weight (dry base). Pure water<br>
was added for a total solid fraction concentration of<br>
25% by weight. While stirring with a 3-1 motor, the<br>
mixture was neutralized with ammonia water (the pH<br>
after neutralization was 7.5-8.0). This was then spray<br>
dried (dispersion supply rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet<br>
temperature: 180-220°C, outlet temperature: 50-70°C),<br>
resulting in a cellulose powder T (corresponds to<br>
Example 2 of Patent Document 1). The various physical<br>
properties of the cellulose powder T are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
(Comparative Example 16)<br>
A low-speed stirrer (30LGL reactor<br>
(Commercial Name) from Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd.)<br>
was used with 2 kg of shredded commercially available<br>
pulp (a natural cellulose dissolved pulp derived from<br>
wood) and 30 L of 3 N aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
Hydrolization was performed for 24 hours at 40°C while<br>
stirring, resulting in acid insoluble residue. After<br>
thoroughly washing the obtained acid insoluble residue<br>
with pure water, the residue was filtered, resulting in<br><br>
a wet flock (the average particle size of the dispersed<br>
cellulose particles in the acid insoluble residue was<br>
55 µm. Of the obtained wet flock, 10% by weight was<br>
further washed thoroughly with pure water, neutralized,<br>

This dried flock was shredded with a home mixer and<br>
then further crushed with a jet mill (single-track jet<br>

obtain a crushed product (the cellulose particle size<br>
was 3 µm. ) The obtained crushed product and the wet<br>
acid insoluble residue described above were placed in a<br>
90 L polyethylene bucket at a composition of 10 parts<br>
by weight to 90 parts by weight (dry base). Pure water<br>
was added for a total solid fraction concentration of<br>
35% by weight. While stirring with a 3-1 motor, the<br>
mixture was neutralized with ammonia water (the pH<br>
after neutralization was 7.5-8.0). This was then spray<br>
dried (dispersion supply rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet<br>
temperature: 180-220°C, outlet temperature: 50-70°C),<br>
resulting in a cellulose powder U (corresponds to<br>
Example 5 of Patent Document 1). The various physical<br>
properties of the cellulose powder U are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
(Comparative Example 17)<br>
A low-speed stirrer (30LGL reactor<br>
(Commercial Name) from Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co., Ltd.)<br>
was used with 2 kg of shredded commercially available<br>
pulp (a natural cellulose kraft pulp derived from<br><br>
cotton linter) and 30 L of 0.14 N aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid. Hydrolization was performed for 1 hour at 121°C<br>
while stirring, resulting in acid insoluble residue.<br>
After thoroughly washing the obtained acid insoluble<br>
residue with pure water, the residue was filtered,<br>
resulting in a wet flock (the average particle size of<br>
the dispersed cellulose particles in the acid insoluble<br>
residue was 36 µm. Of the obtained wet flock, 90% by<br>
weight was further washed thoroughly with pure water,<br>
and then friability with a planetary mixer (the<br>
dispersed cellulose particles in the friated wet flock<br>
had an average particle size of 1 µm. The friated wet<br>
flock and the unfriated wet flock were placed in a 90 L<br>
polyethylene bucket at a composition of 90 parts by<br>
weight to 10 parts by weight (dry base). Pure water<br>
was added for a total solid fraction concentration of<br>
30% by weight. While stirring with a 3-1 motor, the<br>
mixture was neutralized with ammonia water (the pH<br>
after neutralization was 7.5-8.0). This was then spray<br>
dried (dispersion supply rate: 6 kg/hr, inlet<br>
temperature: 180-220°C, outlet temperature: 50-70°C),<br>
resulting in a cellulose powder V (corresponds to<br>
Example 7 of Patent Document 1). The various physical<br>
properties of the cellulose powder V are shown in Table<br>
1-1 and Table 1-2.<br>
Among conventional cellulose powders, only<br>
Comparative Examples 15-17 corresponding to the<br>
Examples of Patent Document 1 meet the ranges of the<br><br>
porous cellulose aggregates of the present application:<br>
the repose angle range; the hardness range of a<br>
cylindrical molded body molded at 10 MPa; and the<br>
hardness range of a cylindrical molded body molded at<br>
20 MPa the disintegration time range of a cylindrical<br>
molded body molded at 20 Mpa. The advantage of the<br>
porous cellulose aggregates of the present application<br>
is that the disintegration time is shorter for similar<br>
hardnesses (Example 5 and Comparative Example 15,<br>
Example 2 and Comparative Example 16, and Example 3 and<br>
Comparative Example 17), thus allowing cylindrical<br>
molded bodies to be disintegrated in roughly half the<br>
time. This is due to the fact that, with the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates from Patent Document 1, even the<br>
larger central pore diameters were approximately 1.5<br>
µm, while the central pore diameters of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present application are at<br>
least approximately 3.0 µm. Thus, the larger central<br>
pore diameters provide a faster water permeation rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

(Example 6 and Comparative Examples 18-28)<br>
The following were placed in a 100 L scale V-<br>
type mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd.) and mixed for 30 minutes:<br>
55 parts of acetaminophen (powder type, API<br>
Corporation); 0.25 parts by weight of light anhydrous<br>
silicic acid (Aerosil 200 (Commercial Name) of NIPPON<br>
AEROSIL CO., LTD.); 27 parts by weight of the cellulose<br>
powder A obtained from Example 1 or the cellulose<br>
powder B, C, E-L, and 0 obtained from the Comparative<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 4-11, 14; 2 parts by weight of<br>
crospovidone (Kollidon CL (Commercial Name) from BASF);<br>
and 15 parts of granular lactose (Super-Tab (Commercial<br>
Name) from Lactose New Zealand). Then, 0.5 parts by<br>
weight of magnesium stearate (plant-based, made by<br>
TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.) are added and<br>
mixed for 5 minutes to obtain a formulated powder. The<br>
total intake for the powders was 25 kg. The formulated<br>
powder was used in a rotary tablet press (LIBRA-II<br>
(Commercial Name) from KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, 36<br>
stations, 410 mm turn table diameter). Pressing was<br>
performed with an 8 mm diameter, 12R punch with a turn<br>
table speed of 50 rpm and a compression force of 7.5<br>
kN, resulting in tablets weighing 200 mg. Tablets were<br>
sampled 60 minutes after initiation of tablet pressing,<br>
and tablet weight, hardness, friability, and tablet<br>
pressing trouble rates were measured. The physical<br>
properties of the obtained tablet are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Since this formula contains a large amount of<br>
drugs with inferior compactibility, obtaining a<br>
hardness of 50 N or higher, the hardness considered<br>
practical for tablets, is difficult. Obtaining<br>
practical tablets is also made difficult because of the<br>
tendency for tablet pressing troubles to occur, i.e.,<br>
sticking at low pressures and capping at high<br>
pressures. Out of the Comparative Examples, the<br>
Comparative Examples 18, 19, 26, 27, 28 provided a<br>
practical tablet hardness of 50 N or higher, but the<br>
variation of 1.8-3.5% in tablet weight was much higher<br>
than the 0.8% of the Examples, making practical<br>
implementation difficult.<br><br>
(Embodiments 7, 8 and Comparative Examples 29-39)<br>
The following were placed in a 100 L scale V-<br>
type mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd) and mixed for 30 minutes:<br>
40 parts of acetaminophen (powder type from API<br><br>
Corporation crushed, 6 µm average particle size); 0.5<br>
parts by weight of light anhydrous silicic acid<br>
(Aerosil 200 (Commercial Name) of NIPPON AEROSIL CO.,<br>
LTD.); 30 parts by weight of the cellulose powder C and<br>
D obtained from Example 3 and Example 4 and the<br>
cellulose powder G, I-P, S, and V obtained from the<br>
Comparative Examples 2, 4-11, 14 and 17; 2 parts by<br>
weight of sodium croscarmellose (Kiccolate ND-2HS<br>
(Commercial Name) produced by NICHIRIN CHEMICAL<br>
INDUSTRIES, LTD. and distributed by Asahi Kasei<br>
Chemicals Corporation); and 27.5 parts of granular<br>
lactose (Super-Tab (Commercial Name) from Lactose New<br>
Zealand). Then, 0.5 parts by weight external ratio of<br>
magnesium stearate (plant-based, made by TAIHEI<br>
CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.) were added and mixed for<br>
5 minutes to obtain a formulated powder. The total<br>
intake for the powders was 2 kg. The formulated powder<br>
was used in a rotary tablet press (Clean Press - 12HUK<br>
(Commercial Name) from KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, 12<br>
stations). Pressing was performed with an 8 mm<br>
diameter, 12R punch with a turntable speed of 54 rpm<br>
and a compression force of 5 kN, resulting in tablets<br>
weighing 180 mg. Tablets were sampled 10 minutes after<br>
initiation of tablet pressing, and tablet weight,<br>
hardness, friability, tablet pressing trouble rates,<br>
and disintegration times (no disk) were measured. The<br>
properties of the obtained tablet are shown in Table 3.<br>
The type of drug in this formula was the same<br><br>
as the previous section, but the fluidity of this<br>
formula is inferior since the drug is crushed. Thus,<br>
the drug content is lower, making reduction of tablet<br>
weight variations difficult while obtaining a practical<br>
tablet hardness of 50 N or higher is difficult.<br>
Obtaining practical tablets is also made difficult<br>
because of the tendency for tablet pressing troubles to<br>
occur, i.e., sticking at low pressures and capping at<br>
high pressures. Out of the Comparative Examples, the<br>
Comparative Examples 29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39<br>
provided a practical tablet hardness of 50 N or higher,<br>
but besides the Comparative Example 39 the variation of<br>
1.6-3.5% in tablet weight was much higher than the 0.2-<br>
0.5% of the Examples, making practical implementation<br>
difficult. With the Comparative Example 39, tablet<br>
hardness and tablet weight variations were similar to<br>
those of the porous cellulose aggregates of the present<br>
invention, but the disintegration time at similar<br>
hardnesses was inferior. In direct tablet pressing,<br>
stable production can be difficult because of a<br>
tendency for there to be differences between drug lots,<br>
especially in granularity. Thus, in terms of drug<br>
granularity it would be preferable to crush the drugs,<br>
but in such cases the fluidity of the crushed drug is<br>
inadequate, preventing the drug content from being<br>
increased. Of the porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention, those with good fluidity, i.e., with<br>
repose angles in a low range of 25-36°, are especially<br><br>
useful in overcoming this problem. Also, for drugs<br>
providing inferior tablet compactibility, excipient<br>
must be added to provide practical hardness. Thus, the<br>
excipient itself must have good fluidity and, in order<br>
to increase the drug content as much as possible, the<br>
excipient must have a degree of compactibility high<br>
enough that a limited amount can provide practical<br>
hardness. The porous cellulose aggregates of the<br>
present invention provides advantages not available in<br>
the conventional cellulose powders in that fluidity and<br>
compactibility are both high enough to overcome the<br>
above problem.<br><br><br><br>
(Embodiment 9, 10, and Comparative Examples 40-51)<br>
The following were placed in a 5 L scale V-<br>
type mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd) and mixed for 30 minutes:<br>
60 parts of ethenzamide (API Corporation, powder grade<br>
crushed with a compact crusher); 0.5 part by weight of<br>
light anhydrous silicic acid (Aerosil 200 (Commercial<br>
Name) of NIPPON AEROSIL CO., LTD.); 10 parts by weight<br>
of the cellulose powder B and E obtained from Examples<br>
2 and 5 and the cellulose powder G, I-P, and S-U<br>
obtained from the Comparative Examples 2, 4-11, and 14-<br>
16; 1.5 parts by weight of sodium croscarmellose<br>
(Kiccolate ND-2HS (Commercial Name) produced by<br>
NICHIRIN CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. and distributed by<br>
Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation); and 28 parts of<br>
granular lactose (Super-Tab (Commercial Name) from<br>
Lactose New Zealand). Then, 0.5 part by weight<br>
external ratio of magnesium stearate (plant-based, made<br>
by TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.) are added and<br>
mixed for 5 minutes to obtain a formulated powder. The<br>
total intake for the powders was 2 kg. The formulated<br>
powder was used in a rotary tablet press (Clean Press -<br>
12HUK (Commercial Name) from KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, 12<br>
stations). Pressing was performed with an 8 mm<br>
diameter, 12R punch with a turn table speed of 54 rpm<br>
and a compression force of 8 kN, resulting in tablets<br>
weighing 180 mg. Tablets were sampled 10 minutes after<br>
initiation of tablet pressing, and tablet weight,<br>
hardness, friability, tablet pressing trouble rates,<br><br>
and disintegration times (no disk) were measured. The<br>
physical properties of the obtained tablet are shown in<br>
Table 4.<br>
Since, in this formula, a drug hard to be<br>
soluble in water is crushed, water disintegration<br>
properties were inferior and fluidity was inferior,<br>
making it difficult to reduce variations in tablet<br>
weight. Furthermore, this formula results in tablet<br>
pressing troubles in the form of capping at high<br>
pressures, thus making it an example of a formula in<br>
which practical implementation with a high drug content<br>
is difficult. Out of the Comparative Examples, the<br>
Comparative Examples 40, 41, 64, 47-51 provided a<br>
practical tablet hardness of 50 N or higher, but the<br>
variation of 1.6-4.0% in tablet weight was much higher<br>
than the 0.5-0.7% of the embodiments, making practical<br>
implementation difficult. With the Comparative<br>
Examples 50, 51, tablet hardness and tablet weight<br>
variations were similar to those of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention, but the<br>
disintegration time at similar hardnesses was inferior.<br>
With lower drug solubility in water, the disintegration<br>
time is the rate-limiting factor, and elution time for<br>
the drug is increased. For quick absorption in the<br>
body, quick disintegration is necessary. As the water<br>
solubility of the drug goes lower, it is clear that the<br>
difference in disintegration time between the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention and the<br><br>
porous cellulose aggregates of Patent Document 1<br>
increases. Thus, the present invention is superior to<br>
the porous cellulose aggregates of Patent Document 1<br>
especially in terms of the quick disintegration of<br>
drugs hard to be soluble in water.<br><br><br><br>
(Embodiment 11, 12, and Comparative Examples 52-63)<br>
The following were placed in a 5 L scale V-<br>
type mixer (Dalton Co., Ltd) and mixed for 30 minutes:<br>
55 parts of ascorbic acid (from Ebisu Co., Ltd.,<br>
crushed); 30 parts by weight of the cellulose powder B<br>
and E obtained from Examples 2 and 5 and the cellulose<br>
powder G, I-P, and S-U obtained from the Comparative<br>
Examples 2, 4-11, and 14-16; 1.5 parts by weight of<br>
sodium croscarmellose (Kiccolate ND-2HS (Commercial<br>
Name) produced by NICHIRIN CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.<br>
and distributed by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation);<br>
and 13 parts of granular lactose (Super-Tab (Commercial<br>
Name) from Lactose New Zealand). Then, 2.0 parts by<br>
weight external ratio of magnesium stearate (plant-<br>
based, made by TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.)<br>
are added and mixed for 5 minutes to obtain a<br>
formulated powder. The total intake for the powders<br>
was 2 kg. The formulated powder was used in a rotary<br>
tablet press (Clean Press - 12HUK (Commercial Name)<br>
from KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD, 12 stations). Pressing<br>
was performed with an 8 mm diameter, 12R punch with a<br>
turn table speed of 54 rpm and a compression force of<br>
10 kN, resulting in tablets weighing 180 mg. Tablets<br>
were sampled 10 minutes after initiation of tablet<br>
pressing, and tablet weight, hardness, friability,<br>
tablet pressing trouble rates, and disintegration times<br>
(no disk) were measured. The physical properties of<br>
the obtained tablet are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
The drug used in this formula provides<br>
relatively good fluidity even when crushed. However,<br>
as the drug content is increased the fluidity of the<br>
formula gradually decreases, thus making it more<br>
difficult to reduce variations in tablet weight when<br>
higher drug content is used. Also, the drug used in<br>
this formula leads to tablet pressing troubles, i.e.,<br>
sticking at low pressures and capping at high<br>
pressures, making it an example of a formula with which<br>
tablets are difficult to practically implement at<br>
higher drug contents. Out of the Comparative Examples,<br>
the Comparative Examples 52, 56, 59-63 provided a<br>
practical tablet hardness of 50 N or higher, but other<br>
than the Comparative Examples 62, 63, the variation of<br>
1.8-2.6% in tablet weight was much higher than the 0.7-<br>
0.8% of the embodiments, making practical<br>
implementation difficult. With the Comparative<br>
Examples 62, 63, tablet hardness and tablet weight<br>
variations were similar to those of the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of the present invention, but the<br>
disintegration time at similar hardnesses was inferior.<br>
The drug used in this formula has relatively high water<br>
solubility but water-repelling magnesium stearate must<br>
be added to avoid tablet pressing troubles. In these<br>
cases, the wettability of the tablet to water is<br>
reduced, tending to delay disintegration time even if<br>
the water solubility of the drug is high. Especially<br>
in cases where the wettability of the tablet or the<br><br>
like is obstructed by an a water-repellant additive or<br>
the like in the formula, the difference in<br>
disintegration times between the porous cellulose<br>
aggregates of the present invention and the porous<br>
cellulose aggregates of Patent Document 1 clearly<br>
increases. Thus the present invention is superior to<br>
the porous cellulose aggregates of Patent Document 1.<br><br><br><br>
