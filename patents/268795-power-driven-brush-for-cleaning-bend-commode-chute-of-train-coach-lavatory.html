				<td>Power Driven Brush for cleaning Bend Commode Chute of Train Coach Lavatory.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power driven circular brush whose diameter is larger than the diameter of commode chute of coaches of Indian Railway style and is capable of squeezing off dirt from the entire curved inside surface of a commode chute and with a removable replenishable cleaning agent container.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Railway passengers often complain about an inherent bad smell inside the Coach. This bad smell is badly felt inside the lavatory and also predominant in lavatory corridor, doorways and 2-3 coupes near lavatory. This is not an exception even in most of the highly maintained upper category of coaches of Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express where the Railway pumps in lots of money and effort towards cleanliness and deodorization.<br>
Study has revealed that the cylindrical shaped curved commode chute of coach toilet is the main source of such bad smell which cannot be cleaned by normal brush due to its curvature and as such remain completely untouched during cleaning. The shape of the commode chute is shown in figure 1.<br><br>
In figure 1, a normal brush can clean the portion AA1BB1 of commode chute easily but the entire portion of BCD and a major portion of B1C1D1 (except B1B2) cannot be cleaned by a normal brush available in the market. As a result,<br><br>
even after flushing sufficient water through lavatory flushing pipe or application of water jet during maintenance, the portion BCD and B2C1D1 do not get cleaned at all and gradually a thick layer of night soil is formed on those areas of commode chute. Those layers of night soils remain inside the unreachable areas of commode chute year after year and not only pollute the complete environment of the coach but also spread various diseases to traveling passengers and maintenance staff. Till now there is no any mechanized device available with the Railways to clean such curved commode chute.<br>
To overcome the difficulty facing by the Railways to clean inside surface of curved commode chute of coach toilet, an AC/DC power driven brush with the cleaning container has been developed which is light in weight, user friendly and capable of cleaning the entire inside surface of the commode chute easily.<br>
Prior Art.<br>
Presently Commode Chute of Coach toilet is being cleaned by firstly flushing water to wet the inside surface, then soap solution and acid is rinsed on the wet surface to soften the dirt, then the wet inside surface is rubbed to the extent possible by hand banister or by a lump of cloth fixed at one end of a relatively long and flexible stick. Cleaning Commode Chute in this manner is a difficult task not only because it requires much physical exertion, but also because the used hand banister or the lump of cloth cannot reach the entire inside curvature of the Commode Chute. However, if somehow the lump of cloth able to reach the entire curvature of the Commode Chute, it cannot exert sufficient pressure to remove hard layer of dirt from each and every point of the commode chute. Moreover the use of acid in this process is a health hazard to the cleaning staff.<br>
The above prior art provides a measure of Scrubbing and cleaning assistance in an economical way, there is a strong need for the provision of an efficient, economical, user as well as environment friendly, satisfactorily performing Commode Chute Cleaning brush. It is to this effectively produced and highly performing function that the present invention is directed.<br>
Summery of the Invention<br>
To eliminate bad odor generated from bend commode chute of toilet of Coaches, one mechanized device has been developed and named as " Power Driven Brush for cleaning Bend Commode Chute of Train Coach Lavatory."<br>
The device has five main components as bellow -<br>
One power driven Circular Brush bigger than the diameter of commode chute.<br>
One bend and suitably long handle that has two main components - a bend conduit and one flexible shaft which is inserted through out the length of the bend<br><br>
conduit. The angle of bend ness of the conduit is given in such a way that it can easily negotiate the inside surface of curved commode chute. About 100 mm at both ends of the flexible shaft are made rigid (hence forth will be termed as upper and lower adaptors) so that they can be fixed firmly inside the bend conduit with the help of bearings. Moreover about 50% of both the rigid ends of the flexible shaft remains outside of the bend conduit. The lower adaptor of the flexible shaft holds flexibly the center of the circular brush and the upper adaptor is connected with one AC/DC motor.<br>
One rotary equipment employed here is one kind of light- weight motor that is energized by an inbuilt Battery or 110-volt or 230-volt power supply. The motor is coupled to the upper adaptor to rotate the flexible shaft as well as the Circular Brush.<br>
One manually operated Liquid Cleaning Agent Container is provided on the bend conduit (handle) near the circular brush to supply requisite quantity of liquid cleaning agent to the Brush while the Brush is in operation. This Container has one Spring Loaded one-way valve in the bottom, which is operated by a thread -one end of which is connected on the valve and the other end is fixed with one Pulling Arm to facilitate pulling and opening of the valve.<br>
One Control Lever is provided near the rotary equipment for better control of the device during operation and to facilitate pulling and releasing of the thread with the help of one attached Pulling Arm for application of liquid cleaning agent on the circular brush.<br>
The rotary equipment rotates the flexible shaft and subsequently the flexible shaft rotates the circular brush. When the rotating circular brush is inserted in the commode chute, it cleans the entire curved portion of commode chute where normal brushes cannot reach. Liquid cleaning agent is applied with the help of a spring-loaded one-way valve fitted in the bottom of the cleaning agent container, which is on the other hand operated manually by a thread and pulling arm assembly.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig 1 shows the shape of a cylindrical Commode Chute of train coach lavatory. The diameter of the commode chute is 150 mm. The length of the first portion i.e. AA1BB1, which extends vertically downward, is 381 mm. The second portion i.e. BB1CC1 which deviate from the vertical axis by an angle of about 30 degrees is of 457 mm long. The third portion i.e. CC1DD1 which is parallel to AAlBBlis of 203 mm long. The total surface length of the Commode Chute from section AA1 to DD1 is 1041 mm.<br><br>
Fig 2 shows the schematic view of one mechanized Circular Brush whose diameter is larger than the diameter of commode chute of train coach lavatory and is capable of squeezing off dirt from the entire curved inside peripheral surface of a commode chute and with a removable replenishable manually operated cleaning agent container. Here the Circular Brush is flexibly connected with one end of a flexible shaft and the other end being connected to power driven trigger type portable rotary equipment. The Flexible Shaft is operably encompassed in a bend conduit that gives the flexible shaft the same rigid bend ness as of Commode Chute. The Flexible Shaft receives torque from the rotary equipment and transmits it to the Brush. One Control Lever is attached near the rotary equipment end of the bend conduit to facilitate better control, easy application of the device and to pull or release of thread of cleaning agent container with the help of the attached pulling arm. One manually operated Liquid Cleaning agent Container is provided on the bend conduit to supply requisite quantity of liquid cleaning agent to the Brush while the Brush is in operation.<br>
Fig 3 shows an alternate version of the present invention where the brush handle has been made straight instead of bend as described in Fig 2. To achieve the required bend ness of the brush handle the outer conduit of the handle has been made flexible in the middle portion with the help of suitable bellow.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the invention is to clean the bend inside peripheral surface of a commode chute of train coach lavatory where normal brushes cannot reach. To achieve the desired cleanliness of the bend commode chute, one brush has been invented which will exert sufficient pressure on the inside peripheral surface of the bend commode chute while it travels rotating from top to bottom of the curved commode chute.<br>
In Figure 2 the schematic diagram of the whole assembly of the brush for cleaning bend commode chute is given indicating different components by 01,02,03,... etc. In Figure 2, A (03) indicates the Circular Brush.<br>
The circular brush (A) is made of hard fibered bristles (22) and its diameter is made larger than the commode chute to such an extent that, an ac/dc rotary device of torque range from 4 Nm to 20 Nm is required to rotate the brush from 01 to 1200 rpm respectively inside the commode chute. More torque implies more pressure employing bigger brush and more rpm means more frequency of rubbing by the circular brush on the inside surface of the commode chute.<br>
In figure 2, the outer diameter of the circular brush (A) is 175 mm, inner diameter is 80 mm, and height/thickness is 60 mm. Length of the hard bristles of the brush is about 40 mm, which are fixed on a 95 mm outer dia and 7.5 mm thick moulded rim (21). Suitable arrangement has been made to connect the circular brush with the lower adaptor (16) of flexible shaft (02) flexibly. Since the outer dia<br><br>
of the circular brush (A) is 25 mm more than the bend commode chute, after rinsing both the commode chute and the brush with water, a gentle push has to be applied on the brush to insert it inside the commode chute. After that, soap solution is applied on the brush and the brush is rotated inside the commode chute and moved up and down to clean the entire inside peripheral surface of the bend commode chute.<br>
In Fig 2, the bend conduit or brush handle (04) is made of Aluminum. Its length is equal to the length of Commode Chute and internal diameter is 20 mm. Any other light material conduit like PVC, FRP etc. of diameter more or less than 20 mm may also be employed instead of Aluminum pipe provided the equipment becomes lighter and it has easy accessibility inside the Commode Chute. The Bend ness of the handle (04) is 30 degree. The bend ness may also be made lesser or greater than 30 degree provided that the device has easy accessibility inside the Commode Chute. At both the ends of the bend handle (04), there are two bearing housings (17 &amp;18) to fit bearings (06 &amp; 07) for assembling bend conduit or handle (04) and lower and upper adapter (16 &amp; 15) respectively of flexible shaft (02).<br>
In Fig. 2, the flexible shaft (02) is a combination of a metal spring and a wire rope. The wire rope is tightly inserted in the spring so that the torque received from the rotary equipment is suitably distributed over the entire length of the spring - wire rope assembly (i.e. flexible shaft). The flexible shaft (02) is capable enough to withstand the required torque to rotate the circular brush (A) inside the commode chute in both clock wise and anti clockwise direction. The length of the flexible shaft \s about 100 mm shorter than the bend conduit. Different length of the flexible shaft can also be employed until and unless it can be assembled inside the bend conduit purposefully and it can rotate freely inside the bend conduit. The diameter of the flexible shaft is sufficiently lesser than the inner diameter of the bend conduit. Having lesser diameter flexible shaft means lesser weight and better rotation. The reason behind using a flexible shaft is that it is the suitable alternative to transmit rotary motion from the rotary equipment (01) to the circular brush (A) through the bend conduit or handle (04).<br>
In Fig 2, the upper adapter (15) and the lower adapter (16) are fixed on both ends of the flexible shaft either by crimping or by cotter or by any other means. There is suitable provision in the lower adapter to hold the circular brush (A) at its center flexibly. On the other hand, the upper adapter is suitable to be grasped by the rotary equipment easily. As far as possible, the adapters diameter should be made smaller to reduce the over all weight of the device.<br>
In figure 2, Flexible-coupling (05) couples the center of the circular brush (A) at T-bar (20) and the lower adapter (16) of flexible shaft (02) in such a manner that the circular brush can negotiate the entire curvature of the commode chute easily.<br><br>
In figure 2, two numbers of waterproof ball bearings (06) and(07) are provided in both ends of bend conduit(04), so that the flexible shaft can rotate inside the conduit freely.<br>
In figure 2, the rotary equipment (01) rotates the flexible shaft (02) and subsequently the circular brush (03). The rotary equipment employed here is one kind of light- weight motor that is energized by a 12V/14.4V/18V/24V inbuilt Battery or 110-volt power source of self-generating system of train coach or 230-volt power supply. The motor is coupled with the flexible shaft in upper adapter (15) with the help of jaw chuck (19).<br>
The liquid cleaning agent container (09) with a spring loaded one way valve (12) is opened manually to supply liquid cleaning agent to circular brush through delivery pipe (13), with the help of a thread (11) connecting the valve (12) and Pulling Arm (14). This thread is suitably attached on the bend conduit by rope holders (10) in such a way that upon pulling and releasing of the Pulling Arm(14) by finger, the spring-loaded valve gets opened or closed accordingly. The threaded lid (23) of the container is provided for replenishing liquid cleaning agent in the container.<br>
One Control Lever (08) is provided near the rotary equipment (01) for better control of the device during operation and to facilitate pulling of the thread (11) for application of liquid cleaning agent on the circular brush. This control lever is economically fixed on the bend conduit below bearing (07). The method of fixing of this control lever is either with the help of a T - joint or welding. The diameter of this control lever is equal or less than that of the diameter of the Bend Conduit (04).<br>
An alternate version of the present invention is shown in Fig 3. Here, the only difference is that, the brush handle (25) has been made straight instead of bend as in 04 of Fig 2. The approximate middle portion of brush handle 25 is made flexible providing suitable bellow (24). As a result, when the brush negotiates the curvature of commode chute, the brush handle gets bent in the portion of flexible bellow (24) in required angle. Except modifying the middle portion of brush handle, other components of Fig 3 have been kept same as of Fig 2. In Fig 3 "N" represents the normal straight condition of the brush handle (25) and "B" indicates the bend position of the brush handle (25) during application inside Commode Chute.<br>
One more alternate version of the present invention is that, there is no flexible shaft (02) inside the bend (04) or middle portion flexible brush handle (25). Here one waterproof motor for rotating the circular brush is fixed operably in the brush holding end of the brush handle and the power source connection is fixed on the other end. The circular brush is coupled with the motor shaft by suitable flexible coupling. Here all the other components remain same as in Fig 2 and Fig 3.<br><br>
The present invention can be carefully designed to permit it to be molded. The invention is designed to be effectively and efficiently utilized to clean Commode Chute of train coach lavatory and other similar contoured tubular structures that are normally difficult to clean and very hard to keep in a sterile condition.<br>
From the proceeding description, it can be seen that a power driven brush to clean curved commode chute of train coach lavatory has been provided that will meet all of the advantages of prior art devices and offer additional advantages not heretofore achievable. With respect to the foregoing invention, the optimum dimensional relationship to the part of the invention including variation in size, materials, shape, form, function, and manner of operation, use and assembly are deemed readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed herein.<br>
The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, and it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described. All suitable modifications and equivalents that fall within the scope of the appended claims are deemed within the present inventive concept.<br><br>
