FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The invention relates to the correlation of clinical manifestations of<br>
neurological disease with a neurotoxin produced by affected brain<br>
mononuclear phagocytes. The invention also relates to methods for detecting<br>
a neurotoxin in a biological sample of a subject. The neurotoxin,<br>
encephalotoxin, has been found to be released by an inflammatory cascade<br>
that chronically damages neurons in neurological disease, for example, HIV-<br>
1-associated dementia (HAD), neuro-AIDS, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease, Mild<br>
Cognitive Impairment, prion disease, mild cognitive/motor dysfunction, acute<br>
stroke, acute trauma, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inflammatory<br>
cascade involves activation of mononuclear phagocytes and loss of synaptic<br>
connections and neurons, thus<br>
Vesulting in a decline in information processing, attention, learning, and information retrieval<br>
with overall loss of intellectual function.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Loss of cognition and dementia associated with neurological disease results from<br>
damage to neurons and synapses that serve as the anatomical substrata for memory, learning, and<br>
information processing. Despite much interest, biochemical pathways responsible for progressive<br>
neuronal loss in these disorders have not been elucidated.<br>
[0005] Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for more than 15 million cases worldwide and is the<br>
most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly (Terry, R.D. et al. (eds.), Alzheimer's Disease,<br>
Raven Press, New York, 1994). AD is thought to involve mechanisms which destroy neurons<br>
and synaptic connections. The neuropathology of this disorder includes formation of senile<br>
plaques which contain aggregates of AbM-42 (Selkoe, Neuron, 1991, 6:487-498; Yankner et al,<br>
New Eng. J. Med., 1991, 325:1S49-1857; Price et al, Neurobiol. Aging, 1992, 13, 623-625;<br>
Younkin, Ann. Neurol., 1995, 37:287-288). Senile plaques found within the gray matter of AD<br>
patients are in contact with reactive microglia and are associated with neuron damage (Terry et<br>
al, "Structural Basis of the Cognitive Alterations in Alzheimer Disease", ALZHEIMER'S Disease,<br>
NY, Raven Press, 1994, Ch. 11, 179-196; Terry, R.D. et al. (eds.), Alzheimer's Disease, Raven<br>
Press, New York, 1994; Perlmutter et al, J. Neurosci. Res., 1992, 33:549-558). Plaque<br>
components from microglial interactions with Ab plaques tested in vitro were found to stimulate<br>
microglia to release a potent neurotoxin, thus linking reactive microgliosis with AD neuronal<br>
pathology (Giulian et al., Neurochem. Int., 1995, 27:119-137).<br>
[0006] Several lines of evidence now support the concept that microglia-derived neurotoxins<br>
contribute to AD pathology. First, microglia-derived toxins can be extracted from AD brain<br>
regions laden with plaques but not from identical brain regions in age-matched control or ALS<br>
brain tissues (Giulian et al. (1995) Neurochem. Int., 27: 119-137; Giulian et al. (1996) J.<br>
Neurosci., 16: 6021-6037). Second, regional distributions of toxic activity show the greatest<br>
concentrations of microglia-derived neuron poisons in neocortical tissues and hippocampi of AD<br>
(vs. controls or ALS), areas containing large numbers of reactive microglia. In contrast,<br>
cerebellum, white matter, and neocortical tissues from normal or ALS patients, which had few, if<br>
any, reactive microglial clusters, show little neurotoxic activity. Moreover, the relative number<br>
of reactive microglial clusters in each brain region is significantly correlated to the level of<br>
neurotoxic activity extracted from that region (p
synthetic human A01-40 or Ab1-42 peptides are found to activate human microglia to release<br>
neurotoxins in culture (Giulian et al. (1995) Neurochem. Int., 27: 119-137; Giulian et al. (1996)<br>
. Neurosci., 16: 6021-6037). No neurotoxic effects, however, are detected when plaques or<br>
peptides were placed directly atop neurons or when microglia are exposed to fractions lacking<br>
plaques isolated from AD, ALS, or normal, aged control brains (Giulian et al. (1995)<br>
Neurochem. Int. 27: 119-137; Giulian et al. (1996)7. Neurosci. 16: 6021-6037). Thus, the toxic<br>
effects of isolated plaques on neurons are indirect and mediated by a neurotoxic activity released<br>
from plaque-stimulated microglia. Fourth, there is neurotoxic activity found in CSF from AD<br>
patients, but not detected in samples from disease controls (U.S. Patent 6,043,283 to Giulian;<br>
Giulian et al. (1999) Am. J. Hum. Genet., 65:13-18). Fifth, infusion of AP-coupled microspheres<br>
into hippocampus produces inflammatory responses at the site of infusion in rats (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,043,283 to Giulian). Together, these data indicate that plaque-activation of microglia<br>
through contact with Ab peptides produces neuron-killing factors in discrete areas of AD brain<br>
(Giulian et al. (1995) Neurochem. Int., 27: 119-137).<br>
[0007] Although most patients developing AD will go through a transient period of mild<br>
cognitive impairment (MCI), they will often not present to a physician during this early phase of<br>
the disease. There is a consensus among research groups that subjects with MCI are at increased<br>
risk for progressing to AD (Grundman et al. (1996) Neurology 46:403; Flicker et al (1991)<br>
Neurology 41:1006-1009; Masur et al. (1994) Neurology 44:1427-1432; Tierney et al. (1996)<br>
Neurology 46:149-154). Memory impairment is commonly the most prominent feature of MCI<br>
but might include other patterns including defects primarily in language or visuomotor<br>
performance (Hughes et al. (1982) Br. J. Psychiatry, 140:566-572; Berg (1988)<br>
Psychophannacol. Bull., 24:637-639; Morris (1993) Neurology, 43:2412-2414; Rubin et al.<br>
(1989) Arch. Neurol, 46:379-382; Grundman et al. (1996) Neurology, 46:403; Flicker et al.<br>
(1991) Neurology, 41:1006-1009; Masur et al. (1994) Neurology, 44:1427-1432;Tierney et al.<br>
(1996) Neurology, 46:149-154). Attempts at characterizing mild cognitive impairment have been<br>
carried out using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, which rates the severity of<br>
dementia as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. Rubin et al. ((1989) Arch. Neurol., 46:379-382)<br>
concluded that individuals with a CDR of 0.5 likely have "very mild" AD in the majority of<br>
cases [The CDR 0.5 classification is characterized by consistent forsetfulness. which is mild<br>
with little if any impairment in other functions such as orientation, community affairs, home, and<br>
hobbies, judgment, and personal care.] Other measures also have been used to identify MCI<br>
subjects. For example, poor delayed recall has been shown to be the best predictor of<br>
progression, the best predictor of subsequent dementia in non demented elderly subjects, and the<br>
best discriminator between normal aging and mild AD (Flicker et al. (1991) Neurology, 41:1006-<br>
1009; Masui et al. (1994) Neurology, 44.T427-1432;Tierney et al. (1996) Neurology, 46:149-<br>
154). The time required for subjects with MCI to develop a clinical diagnosis of AD has been<br>
estimated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at about 30% at 2 years and<br>
45% at 3 years.<br>
[0008] HTV-1 infection and neuro-AIDS produce devastating effects upon the brain and spinal<br>
cord. Although the underlying anatomical basis for impaired cognition during HTV-1 infection<br>
remains obscure, there is a reduction of up to 40% of large neurons scattered throughout the<br>
neocortex in advanced disease with dementia (Masliah et al. (1992) J. Neuropath Exp Neurol..<br>
51: 585-593) and a striking early loss of synapses (Asare et al. (1996) Am J Path 148: 31-38;<br>
Everall et al. (1993) J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 52: 561-566).<br>
[0009] HTV-1 associated dementia (HAD) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, declining<br>
motor performance, and behavioral changes. It occurs primarily in the more advanced stages of<br>
HIV infection when CD4 cell counts are relatively low. While the progression of dysfunction is<br>
variable, it is regarded as a serious complication with fatal outcome. The diagnosis of cognitive<br>
loss due to HTV is by process of exclusion — no approved marker exists to monitor HTV-specific<br>
injury to the CNS. Without such a marker, there are no clinical indications to evaluate patients<br>
until significant functional loss appears and there are few opportunities to develop new treatment<br>
strategies to prevent HTV brain damage. Therefore, it is very desirable to identify patients at<br>
early pre-symptomatic stages.<br>
[0010] Prior to HAART (defined here as combination therapy using 3 or more anti-retroviral<br>
agents), 60% of those with AIDS developed dementia. This incidence appeals to have fallen to<br>
about 10 to 15%, but cognitive dysfunction remains a problem for over half of the HTV/AIDS<br>
population (Giulian et al. (1990) Science, 250.-1593-1596; Giulian et al. (1993) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci., 90:2169-2113; Giulian (1995) In: Neuroglia (H Kettenmann, B Ransom Eds)<br>
Oxford University Press, pp. 671-684: Giulian et al. (1998) In: Inflammatory Mechanisms of<br>
Neurodegeneration and Its Management (P. Wood, ed.); Humana Press, Vol 4, pp. 109-<br>
128).<br>
[0011] HIV-1 brain pathology involves diffuse synaptic damage in the neocortex, the loss of<br>
cortical neurons, and a population of infected, reactive mononuclear phagocytes, including<br>
invading blood monocytes, microglia, and multi-nucleated giant cells. These giant cells represent<br>
a fusion of HTV-infected monon uclear phagocytes that are coated with gp120, the retro viral<br>
envelope protein; presence of giant cells has been correlated with cognitive impairment during<br>
HIV-1 infection. Currently, most research groups in the field agree that poisons released by<br>
infected mononuclear phagocytes are a primary cause of cognitive loss in the HIV-1 (+)<br>
population (Vitokovic et al. (1998) Medical Sciences, 321: 1015-1021; Morgello et al. (2001)<br>
Neuropath. App. Neurobiol, 27: 326-335; Lawrence et al.. (2002) Microbes and Infection, 4:<br>
301-308; Masliah et al. (1992) J. Neuropath. Exp. NeuroL, 51: 585-593; Maslliah et al. (1995) J.<br>
Neuropath, and Exp. NeuroL, 54: 350-357; Asare et al. (1996) Am. J. Path., 148: 31-38; Everall<br>
et.al. (1993) J. Neuropath. Exp. NeuroL, 52: 561-566).<br>
[0012] Several lines of evidence now support the concept that mononuclear phagocyte-derived<br>
neurotoxins contribute to the neuron injury within brain during HTV-1 infection. First, HTV-1<br>
neither infected neurons nor showed a direct toxic effect upon neurons (Giulian et al. (1996) j.<br>
Neurosci., 16:3139-3153, Giulian etal, (1990) Science 250: 1593-1596; Le.vine etal. (1976)<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 452: 458-467). Second, HTV-1 mononuclear phagocytes (THP-1, U937,<br>
human blood monocytes, and human brain microglia) released neurotoxins when infected in<br>
vitro with HTV-1; in contrast, lymphocytes (H9, human blood lymphocytes) did not (Giulian et<br>
al. (1996) J. Neurosci., 16:3139-3153; Giulian etal. (1990) Science, 250: 1593-1596). Third,<br>
human mononuclear phagocytes (blood monocytes and microglia) isolated from infected donors<br>
released the same neurotoxin as recovered from in vitro experiments; again, isolated infected<br>
lymphocytes did not (Giulian et al. (1996) J. Neurosci., 16:3139-3153). Fourth, neurotoxic<br>
activity can be recovered from brain tissues of infected individuals (Giulian et al. (1993) Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:2769-2773; Giulian (1995) In: Neuroglia (H Kettenmann, B Ransom, Eds,)<br>
Oxford University Press, pp. 671-684; Giulian et al. (1998) In: Inflammatory Mechanisms OF<br>
Neurodegeneration and Its Management (P. Wood, ed.); Humana Press, Vol 4, pp. 109-<br>
128). Fifth, gpl20, the viral envelope glycoprotein, can stimulate neurotoxin release from human<br>
blood monocytes and microglia; other viral proteins including tat did not (Levine et al. (1976)<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 452: 458-467). Sixth, high concentrations of neurotoxin were found in<br>
the cerebrospinal fluid of HTV-1(+) individuals. And seventh, a family of neurotoxic heparan<br>
oligosaccharides can be isolated from HTV-1 infected cells and from HTV CSF.<br>
[0013] Although reactive mononuclear phagocytes release a number of bio-active substances,<br>
few of these compounds are actually able to harm neurons at concentrations found to exist in<br>
neurodegenerative disease (Hardy et al. (2002) Science, 297:353; Mourdian et al., (1989)<br>
Neurosci. Lett., 105: 233; Milstein et al. (1994) J. Neurochemistry, 63,1178; Giulian et al.<br>
(1990) Science, 250:1593). Moreover, few of such candidate neuron poisons are present in both<br>
AD and HAD. For example, increased tissue concentrations of "toxic" forms of Ab1-42 are<br>
characteristic for AD (Hardy et al. (2002) Science, 297:353), but do not occur in HAD.<br>
Similarly, elevated quinolinic acid levels occur in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects with<br>
HAD (Mourdian et al. (1989) Neurosci. Lett., 105:233), but not in those with AD (Milstein, et al.<br>
(1994) J. Neurochemistry, 63: 1178). In contrast, both AD and HAD brain tissues contain a<br>
heterogeneous group of small stable molecules with potent neurotoxic actions (Giulian et al.<br>
(1990.) Science, 250:1593; Giulian et al. (1995) Neurochem. Int., 27:119; Giulian et al. (1996) J.<br>
Neuroscience 16: 6021). Cultured mononuclear phagocytes activated by exposure to amyloid<br>
plaques, synthetic b-amyloid peptides. HTV'-l, or gpl20, produce these same neurotoxins<br>
(Giulian, et al. (1993) Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 2769; Giulian et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem..<br>
273: 29119). Such observations suggest that a common, though unidentified, pathway mediates<br>
immune-driven neuron pathology in both AD and HAD.<br>
[0014] As the clinical expression of neurological disease may occur only after a significant<br>
degree of neuron loss and synaptic damage beyond a critical threshold necessary for adequate<br>
adaptive function, early pre-symptomatic detection of disease pathology offers the opportunity to<br>
slow disease progression. The present invention provides methods for diagnosis of neurological<br>
disease and risk for Joss of cognition, including, for example, Alzheimer's disease, HTV-1<br>
associated dementia (HAD), neuro-AIDS, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment<br>
(MCI), prion disease, mild cognitive/ motor dysfunction, acute stroke, or acute trauma. The<br>
methods of the invention allow early detection of neurological disease and risk for loss of<br>
cognition, thereby allowing earlier intervention in the progression of disease. Also provided are<br>
methods for monitoring the progression and treatment of neurological disease by monitoring<br>
encephalotoxin levels in a subject.<br>
8UMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
(9015] The present invention provides various embodiments of methods for detecting<br>
an encephalotoxin in a biological sample of a subject with neurological disease or facing<br>
risk for loss of cognition. In some embodiments of the invention; detection of the<br>
encephalotoxin involves contacting a biological sample of the subject with neurons both<br>
in the presence of and in the absence of an inactivator of the enoephalotoxin and<br>
comparing neuron survival in the presence of the encephalotoxin inactivator relative to<br>
neuron survival in the absence of the encephalotoxin inactivator. A decrease in neuron<br>
survival in the absence of the encephalotoxin inactivator is indicative of the neurological<br>
disease or risk for loss of cognition. In some embodiments of the invention,<br>
encephalotoxin is detected by measuring light absorbance of the biological sample in the<br>
both the presence of and in the absence of a encephalotoxin inactivator, an increase in<br>
absorbance in the absence of the encephalotoxin inactivator being indicative of<br>
neurological disease or risk for loss of cognition. Preferably, light absorbance is<br>
measured at a wavelength of 232 nanometers (nm).<br>
[0016] In some embodiments of the invention, the encephalotoxin is an<br>
oligosaccharide having at least one glucosamine having N-sulfation and O6-sulfation;<br>
lacking peptide bonds; and having<br>
a molecular mass of less than about 2000 daltons. Preferably, the encephalotoxin has 4 to 8<br>
saccharide units. Preferably, the molecular mass of the encephalotoxin is between about 700 and<br>
1900 daltons.<br>
[0017] In some embodiments, the encephalotoxin inactivator is heparin lyase I, nitrous acid,<br>
glucosamine-6-sulfatase, or N-sulfamidase. Preferably, the nitrous acid solution has a pH of<br>
about 1.5.<br>
[0018] In some embodiments of the invention, the biological sample is cerebrospinal fluid,<br>
spinal cord tissue, or brain tissue.<br>
[0019] Neurological diseases that may be diagnosed or monitored by the methods of the<br>
invention include neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory diseases and disorders such as, but<br>
not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, Creutzfeld-jakob Disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-<br>
1 (HlV-l)-associated dementia (HAD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), prion disease, mild<br>
cognitive/ motor dysfunction, acute stroke, acute trauma, and neuro-AIDS. In various<br>
embodiments, the methods of the invention may be used in the diagnosis or monitoring of<br>
human, primate, bovine, equine, canine, feline, porcine, or rodent subjects.<br>
[0020] In some embodiments of the invention, comparison of neuron survival comprises<br>
comparison of the ED50 of the encephalotoxin in the presence of the encephalotoxin inactivator<br>
relative to the ED50 of the encephalotoxin in the absence of the encephalotoxin inactivator,<br>
wherein a lower ED50 of the encephalotoxin in the absence of encephalotoxin inactivator relative<br>
to the ED50 of the encephalotoxin in the presence of encephalotoxin inactivator is indicative of<br>
neurological disease or risk for loss of cognition.<br>
[0021] In further embodiments of the invention are provided methods of monitoring treatment<br>
of a neurological disease in a subject. In some embodiments, the method of monitoring involve<br>
comparing the encephalotoxin levels in a first and second biological sample of a subject, wherein<br>
the first biological sample is taken from the subject at an earlier timepoint than the second<br>
biological sample, wherein the second biological sample is taken from the subject following<br>
treatment of the neurological disorder, and wherein encephalotoxin level is measured by light<br>
absorbance of the biological sample, an increase in absorbance of the second biological sample<br>
being indicative of progression of the neurological disease. In some embodiments, the first<br>
biological sample is taken, removed, or extracted from the subject following a treatment (e.g.,<br>
administration of a drug) of the neurological disease.<br>
[0022] In further embodiments of the invention are provided methods of monitoring<br>
progression of neurological disease in a subject comprising detecting an increase in<br>
encephalotoxin level in said subject over time, wherein detecting the increase in encephalotoxin<br>
level comprises measuring an increased light absorbance of an encephalotoxin in a first<br>
biological sample of the subject relative to light absorbance of an encephalotoxin of a second<br>
biological sample of the subject, wherein the second biological sample is taken from the subject<br>
before the first biological sample, increased light absorbance being indicative of progression of<br>
the neurological disease.<br>
[0023] Also provided by embodiments of the invention are methods for monitoring progression<br>
of neurological disease in a subject comprising detecting an increase in encephalotoxin level in<br>
the subject over time, wherein detecting the increase involves contacting a first biological sample<br>
of the subject with neurons, contacting a second biological sample of the subject with neurons,<br>
and detecting decreased neuron survival in the presence of the second biological sample, wherein<br>
the second biological sample is taken at a later timepoint than the first biological sample; and<br>
wherein decreased neuron survival in the presence of the second biological sample is indicative<br>
of progression of the neurological disease.<br>
[0024] In some embodiments of the invention, one of the biological samples is taken during the<br>
prodromic phase of said neurological disease.<br>
[0025] In another embodiment of the invention, methods of monitoring treatment of a<br>
neurological disease in a subject by detecting an increase in encephalotoxin level in a subject<br>
over time, wherein detecting the increase in encephalotoxin level involves contacting a first<br>
biological sample of the subject with neurons, contacting a second biological sample of the<br>
subject with neurons, and detecting decreased neuron survival in the presence of the second<br>
biological sample, wherein the second biological sample is taken at a later timepoint than the<br>
first biological sample and following a treatment of the neurological disease; and wherein<br>
decreased neuron survival is indicative of progression of the neurological disease.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0026] Figure 1 illustrates inactivation of encephalotoxin by various methods specific for<br>
heparan sulfate and heparin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, encephalotoxin released by BV2 microglia<br>
was inactivated by nitrous acid pH 1.5, by heparin lyase I (E.C. 4.2.2.7), and by sulfatases that<br>
cleave at O-6 and from N-sulfated glucosamine (GIcNS) (glucosamine-6-sulfatase (E.C.<br>
3.1.6.14) and N-sulfarninidase (E.C. 3.10.1.1)). As shown in Fig. IB, encephalotoxin found in<br>
ventricular CSF of AD brain was inactivated by nitrous acid pH 1.5, by heparin lyase I, and by<br>
sulfatases that cleave at O-6 and from GlcNS. As demonstrated in Figure 1C, encephalotoxin<br>
recovered from lumbar CSF of subject with AD was inactivated by nitrous acid pH 1.5, by<br>
heparin lyase I, and by sulfatases that cleave at O-6 and from GlcNS.<br>
[0027] Figure 2 illustrates the determination of molecular mass of encephalotoxin using a<br>
TSK-GW2500PXL with a linear sieving range from 300 to 3000 daltons. Commercially<br>
available heparan oligomers were used as standards. CSF samples (100 ml) from probable AD<br>
showed a minor peak and major peak of neurotoxic activity that range in size from about 700 to<br>
1,900 daltons. These estimated molecular masses suggest that at least some forms of<br>
encephalotoxin comprise about 4 to 8 saccharide residues.<br>
[0028] Figure 3 shows dose response curves for encephalotoxin isolated from probable AD,<br>
MCI, and normal elderly subjects. Increasing amounts of toxin are found in those subjects with<br>
greater cognitive impairment.<br>
[0029] Figure 4A shows the results of anion-exchange HPLC (ProPAK PA1, 0.0 to 0.7 M<br>
NaCl, UV @ 232 nm) separation of encephalotoxin from microglial BV2 cells stimulated with<br>
Ab1-42. Three peaks (PEAK 38, 48, and 53) corresponding to the encephalotoxin were detected.<br>
The encephalotoxin of PEAKS 38, 48, and 53 was 1) sensitive to heparin lyase I, 2) sensitive to<br>
nitrous acid pH 1.5 and 3) toxic to hippocampal neurons (data not shown). As demonstrated in<br>
Figure 4B, these same peaks were absent from conditioned media recovered from control BV2<br>
cells that were not exposed to Ab1-42.<br>
[0030] Figure 5A illustrates the presence of encephalotoxin in ventricular and lumbar CSF<br>
recovered from autopsy cases. Figure 5B illustrates the presence of encephalotoxin in<br>
ventricular and lumbar CSF recovered from autopsy cases living subjects. Data are expressed in<br>
terms of CSF volumes required to elicit death of cultured hippocampal neurons. As shown in the<br>
dose response curves (Figure 5A), small volumes of high toxin concentrations shift curves to the<br>
left, as found in those subjects with definite AD (diagnosis confirmed by autopsy). These data<br>
can also be expressed as ED50S (volumes of CSF required to give 50% maximal killing). As<br>
shown in Figure 5B, a similar pattern was found in those subjects with probable AD (clinical<br>
diagnosis) who have small ED50S (0.1 to 10 m1), followed by those in the MCI group with<br>
moderate values (10 to 200 ml). Importantly, various other diagnostic groups showed no<br>
detectable encephalotoxin (ED50S &gt; 1000 ul).<br>
[0031] Figure 6 shows PEAKs 38, 48, and 53 in CSF of AD (Panels A,B) and MCI (C), but<br>
not in normal elderly control (D) in anion exchange HPLC. These peaks were heparin lyase I<br>
sensitive (data not shown). As shown in Figure 6E, bioassays of these HPLC fractions confirm<br>
the same peaks are neurotoxic.<br>
[0032] Figure 7 shows that, in anion-exchange HPLC (linear gradient of 0 to 2.0 M NaCl over<br>
90 min), 3 discrete peaks of neurotoxic activity are found in 100 ml of CSF from definite AD<br>
(Figure 7A), probable AD (Figure 7B), and HAD (Figure 7C). No toxic activity is recovered<br>
fripm vascular dementia (Figure 7A). Heparin lyase I and N-sulfaminidase, but not heparin lyase<br>
II, eliminate all toxin peaks.<br>
[0033] Figure 8 illustrates the CSF Neurotoxicity Index, [calculated as value of equivalent<br>
volume of CSF to yield'50% of total killing effect upon a standardized rat hippocampal neuron<br>
culture assay] from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a variety of neurological disorders.<br>
As shown in Figure 8A, samples from definite Alzheimer's disease (AD) and FIV-1 infection<br>
contain encephalotoxins. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained during routine lumbar myelogram<br>
(Myelograms) were from subjects without memory complaints. Neuropathy refers to subjects<br>
with cranial or peripheral nerve disorders while subjects with psychiatric diagnoses had no<br>
evidence of neurological disease. Other neurological diseases included fungal meningitis, neuro-<br>
syphilis, multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Figure SB compares<br>
CSF index scores with HTV-1(+) volunteers with no cognitive loss, mild cognitive motor<br>
dysfunction (MCMD), or HAD. Significant differences exist among MCMD and HAD, again<br>
supporting the pattern that more toxin is associated with greater degrees of cognitive impairment.<br>
Figure 8C compares CSF index scores for elderly volunteers with no cognitive loss, with MCI,<br>
with probable AD, or with non-AD dementia (caused by traumatic, vascular, or ethanol injury).<br>
MCI shows a consistent and significantly elevated level of encephalotoxin above other forms of<br>
dementia. Bars show median values. Figure 8D compares Neurotoxicity Index values vs. T<br>
scores for the paced auditory serial-addition test (PASAT, a sensitive measure of information<br>
processing.) As shown, a significant linear relationship exists between CSF Neurotoxicity Index<br>
and this cognitive measure (n=26; p
[0034] Figure 9 shows a comparison of CSF Neurotoxicity Index scores of CSF from elderly<br>
subjects. Probable AD and MCI show significant toxin levels with an overlap in distribution of<br>
values. CSF neurotoxin levels clearly separate AD pathology from other categories common to<br>
the aged. (Bar = mean values.)<br>
[0035] Figure 10 shows two examples of drug effects upon CSF encephalotoxin levels. Single<br>
drug treatment (identity of drugs remains coded) failed to offer full suppression of toxin (i.e.,<br>
shifted Index scores to a normal range of &gt;100 as noted in Table 1) after a 6-week trial. In<br>
contrast, DAP/HCQ for 6 weeks provided complete inhibition of toxin production in all subjects<br>
tested to date (5 of 5).<br>
[0036] The referenced patents, patent applications, and scientific literature referred to herein<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Any conflict between any reference cited<br>
herein and the specific teachings of this specification shall be resolved in favor of the latter.<br>
likewise, any conflict between an art-understood definition of a word or phrase and a definition<br>
of the word or phrase as specifically taught in this specification shall be resolved in favor of the<br>
latter.<br>
[0037] As used herein, the term "about" refers to an approximation of a stated value within an<br>
acceptable range. Preferably the range is +/-10% of the stated value.<br>
[0038] Definite AD was diagnosed at autopsy using consensus neuropathological criteria (The<br>
NIA-Reagan Working Group. Consensus recommendations for the postmortem diagnosis of<br>
Alzheimer's disease. (1997) Neurobiol. Aging, 18:S1). The clinical definition for probable AD<br>
followed consensus recommendations (McKhann et al. (1984) Neurology 34:939) with<br>
impairment defined as psychometric performance falling at least 2 standard deviations (SD)<br>
below mean normative mean values in Learning/Memory [measured by the Wechsler Memory<br>
Scale-El Logical Memory Subtest, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, or Brief Visual<br>
Memory Test-Revised, and 2 SD below normative mean on at least one test within the following<br>
cognitive domains: Attention/Information Processing [Verbal Sustained Attention Test, Symbol<br>
Digit Modalities Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-Ill Digit Span, Trails A Test, and Paced<br>
Auditory Serial-Addition Test (PASAT)], Orientation (Orientation questions), Language<br>
[Naming and Category Fluency, FAS Test], Executive Function [Wisconsin Card Sort Test and<br>
Trials B Test]. Subjects with MCI are defined as those without dementia but who show amnestic<br>
features including a memory complaint confirmed by an informant and a memory impairment<br>
measured at least 1.5 SD below normative mean values using the same testing battery as for AD.<br>
[0039] The clinical definitions for HTV-related cognitive impairments followed consensus<br>
recommendation (Working Group of American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force (1992)<br>
Neurology, 41:778) with subjects showing no evidence for other etiologies. Measured<br>
impairment for HTV-associated dementia (HAD) fell 2.5 SD below normative means in one<br>
domain or 2 SD in at least two domains on any of the following tests: Learning/Memory,<br>
Language, Attention/Information Processing, Abstraction/Problem Solving, and Motor Abilities<br>
[Grooved Pegboard]. Subjects with mild cognitive-motor dysfunction (MCMD) are defined as<br>
those falling 1.5 SD below mean normative values in any test in at least two cognitive domains<br>
or 2.0 SD below mean values in a single domain.<br>
[0040] As used herein, "loss of cognition" or variants thereof refer to a decline in at least one<br>
of information processing, attention, learning, information retrieval, and overall loss of<br>
intellectual function. Loss of cognition may be measured by any method known in the art,<br>
including, for example, Attention/Information Processing [Verbal Sustained Attention Test,<br>
Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-III Digit Span, Trails A Test,<br>
and Paced Auditory Serial-Addition Test (PASAT)], Orientation (Orientation questions),<br>
Language [Naming and Category Fluency, FAS Test], Executive Function [Wisconsin Card Sort<br>
Test and Trials B Test], Learning/Memory, Abstraction/Problem Solving, Motor Abilities<br>
[Grooved Pegboard], and Hopkins Verbal tests. A subject at risk for loss of cognition has no<br>
measurable loss of cognition but has a greater chance for loss of cognition than the average<br>
population. For example, a first-degree relative of an Alzheimer's disease patient is at risk for<br>
loss of cognition.<br>
[0041] As used herein, the term "contact" or "contacting" means bringing together, either<br>
directly or indirectly, a compound into physical proximity to a molecule of interest. Contacting<br>
may occur, for example, in any number of buffers, salts, solutions, or in a cell or cell extract.<br>
[0042] The term "peptide bond" means a covalent amide linkage formed by loss of a molecule<br>
of water between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino<br>
acid.<br>
[0043] The term "saccharide" or "saccharide unit" includes oxidized, reduced or substituted<br>
saccharides. Saccharides of this invention include, but are not limited to, ribose, arabinose,<br>
xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, fructose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose,<br>
ribulose, sorbose, tagatose, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, glucaric acididuronic acid rhamnose,<br>
fucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, N-acetyl neuraminic acid, sialic acid, N-<br>
sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS), 2-sulfated iduronic acid (IdoA2S), derivatives of saccharides<br>
such as acetals, amines, and phosphorylated sugars, oligosaccharides, as well as open chain<br>
forms of various sugars, and the like. "Oligosaccharide" refers to a molecule having two or more<br>
saccharide units.<br>
[0044] The term "purified", when used to describe the state of the neurotoxin of the invention,<br>
refers to a neurotoxin substantially free of other cellular material. "Substantially free" refers to<br>
at least about 60% or about 70%, more preferably at least about 80% or about 90%, and most<br>
preferably at least about 95%, about 98%, or about 100% free of other cellular materials.<br>
[0045] The prodromic phase of pathology of neurodegenerative or neuro-inflammatory disease<br>
is defined herein as that stage in the disease during which the clinical manifestations of<br>
cognitive, behavioral, or social impairment have not yet reached a diagnostic threshold for MCI<br>
(amnesic features with memory testing 1.5 SD below normative mean) or AD (2 SD below<br>
normative means in memory and at least one other cognitive domain). By this definition, the<br>
prodromic phase would encompass, for example, the clinically-defined Cognitive Impairment, -<br>
No Dementia (CIND) population (Toukko et al. (2001) Int. Psychogeriatr., Supp. 1:183-202),<br>
the at-risk asymptomatic population described by Horn ((1994) J. Clin. Exp. Neurol., 16: 568-<br>
5,76), the Age-Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI, Goldman er al. (2001) Alz. Dis. Assoc.<br>
Dis., 15: 72-79), the subclinical cohort of the Farmington study (Elias et al. (2000) Arch. Neurol.<br>
57: S08-S13) or a preclinical AD population defined identified at autopsy (Price et al (2001)<br>
Arch. Neurol., 58: 1395-1402). In general, all these groups show memory test values (verbal,<br>
episodic memory) at about 1 SD below normative mean scores adjusted for age, education, and<br>
ethnicity. Overall, populations at-risk for AD showed longitudinal declines at a rate of about 0.3<br>
to 0.6 SD per year from normalized memory test scores tests.<br>
[0046] The signaling cascade involved in the neurodegenerative diseases addressed by the<br>
present invention comprises events including (1) mononuclear phagocyte activation; (2)<br>
mononuclear phagocyte release of encephalotoxin; and (3) the toxic effect of encephalotoxins on<br>
neurons. Neurotoxicity of a mononuclear phagocyte induced by a mononuclear phagocyte<br>
activator may be inhibited or inactivated by an agent referred to herein as a neurotoxin inhibitor<br>
or inactivator.<br>
[0047] A mononuclear phagocyte is an immune cell which has a single nucleus and the ability<br>
to engulf particles, also known as phagocytosis. Mononuclear phagocytes are found in blood and<br>
body tissues, including the central nervous system and brain, and include, for example, microglia<br>
cells, monocytes, macrophages, histiocytes, dendritic cells, precursor cells of microglia,<br>
precursor cells of monocytes, precursor cells of macrophages, microglia-like cell lines,<br>
macrophage-like cell lines, or cell lines modified to express microglia-like surface molecules that<br>
are active in accordance with the above definition of mononuclear phagocyte. A neuron as<br>
defined in accordance with the present invention includes a neuron and neuron-like cell, which is<br>
a cell modified to.express a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor which neuron exhibits neuronal<br>
activity under typical normal, non-diseased state, conditions.<br>
[0048] Mononuclear phagocyte activation initiates a process that causes the release of<br>
neurotoxins. Mononuclear phagocyte activation is also referred to herein as immune activation,<br>
markers of which are any process that renders a mononuclear phagocyte more dynamic and<br>
characterized by activities such as and not limited to increased movement, phagocytosis,<br>
alterations in morphology, and the biosynthesis, expression, production, or secretion of<br>
molecules, such as protein, associated with membranes including complement, scavengers, Ab,<br>
and blood cell antigens, histocompatibility antigens for example. Production of molecules<br>
includes enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive agents such as nitric oxide synthetase,<br>
superoxide dismutase, small molecules such as eicosanoids, cytokines, free radicals and nitric<br>
oxide. Release of factors includes proteases, apolipoproteins such as apolipoprotein E, and<br>
cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor as well as other molecules such as<br>
encephalotoxin and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0049] Mononuclear phagocyte neurotoxicity or neuron toxicity refers to a process that leads to<br>
the injury, destruction, or death of neurons, which is measured by loss of metabolic function,<br>
release of intracellular material, penetration of impermeant dyes, reduction of cell number<br>
measured by biochemical or histological methods. For example, changes in biochemical markers<br>
such as loss of neurofilaments or synaptophysin or release of lactate dehydrogenase, or other<br>
evidence of cell injury such as penetration of impermanent dyes, including fluorescent nuclear<br>
dyes and trypan blue. These and other strategies for identifying cell injury, destruction or death,<br>
or measuring neuron function, are known to one skilled in the art and are contemplated by the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0050] Neurotoxin is defined herein as a substance that injures, damages, or kills a neuron<br>
while sparing other central nervous system cells such as glia, for example. A neurotoxin interacts<br>
with neurons in such a way as to disrupt neuron function and survival. The possible actions of a<br>
neurotoxin on neurons, also referred to herein as neuronal damage, include inhibition or<br>
disruption of normal cell metabolism, including metabolism of glucose, the production of ATP,<br>
and maintenance of ion gradients across cell membranes including Na+, Ca2+, and K+ ion<br>
channels, the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids, and mitochondrial respiration, and cell<br>
death.<br>
[0051] Encephalotoxin as used herein refers to a class of neurotoxins having low molecular<br>
mass (
to nitrous acid, N-suIfamidase, glucosamine-6-sulfatase, and heparin lyase I. Encephalotoxins<br>
comprise at least one GlcNS residue. An encephalotoxin preferably has a molecular weight<br>
between about 700 and 1,900 daltons. The encephalotoxin preferably has 4 to 8 saccharide<br>
residues.<br>
[0052] Encephalotoxin inactivators or inhibitors are agents which inactivate neurotoxin or<br>
inhibit the effects of neurotoxins that are released from activated mononuclear phagocytes. For<br>
purposes of the present invention, inhibit, inhibition, inactivate, inactivation, and variations<br>
thereof are used synonymously with reduce, suppress, retard, slow, and suspend. Inactivation or<br>
inhibition also refers to complete inhibition of the neurotoxin cascade such that the cascade is<br>
arrested, stopped, or blocked. Encephalotoxin inactivation includes reduction of neurotoxic<br>
activity by about 10%, 20%, 50%, more preferably about 80%, 90%, or 95%, and most<br>
preferably about 98%, 99%, or 100%. By way of example, a compound is an encephalotoxin<br>
inactivator if it reduces the neurotoxic activity of the encephalotoxin or increases neuron survival<br>
$uch that neurons otherwise at risk of damage upon exposure to the encephalotoxin are not<br>
damaged in the presence of the encephalotoxin and the compound. Preferably, more than about<br>
10%, 20%, or 50% of the neurons at risk are not damaged by the encephalotoxin in the presence<br>
of the encephalotoxin inactivator. Even more preferably, about 80%, 90%, or 95%, and most<br>
preferably, about 98%, 99%, or 100% of the neurons at risk are not damaged by the<br>
encephalotoxin in the presence of the encephalotoxin inactivator. Preferable encephalotoxin<br>
inactivators of the invention include heparin lyase I, N-sulfaminidase, glucosamine-6-sulfatase,<br>
and nitrous acid. Nitrous acid preferably has a pH of about 1.5. More preferably, exposure to<br>
nitrous acid occurs at room temperature.<br>
[0053] An effective amount of a mononuclear phagocyte and an activator is the amount of each<br>
normally resulting in an event in the cascade, but for the addition of an encephalotoxin<br>
inactivator. An effective amount will be known to a skilled artisan in view of the present<br>
disclosure and will vary depending on the use of a mononuclear phagocyte, neuron, activator or<br>
components, and the mammalian origin of the cells.<br>
[0054] In vitro neurotoxicity assays of the invention detect the presence of encephalotoxin and<br>
inactivation thereof and employ cultures of neurons or neuron-like cell lines which have been<br>
modified to express N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The presence of neurotoxic activity, or a<br>
measure of neuron function or measure of neuron survival, will be determined by reduction in<br>
cell number, changes in biochemical markers such as loss of cell metabolic function, release of<br>
intracellular material, penetration of impermeant dyes, such as and not limited to fluorescent<br>
nuclear dyes and trypan blue, loss of neurofilament or synaptophysin, release of lactate<br>
dehydrogenase, or other evidence of cell injury. Other methods of measuring neuron function<br>
include detecting the inhibition of normal cell metabolism including the disruption of glucose<br>
metabolism, ATP production, ion gradient maintenance across cell membranes, and protein<br>
synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Reductions in an inflammatory<br>
marker or injury to a neuron by a test biological sample may be compared to a control. These and<br>
other strategies for identifying cell neurotoxicity or measuring neuron function, which may be<br>
displayed as cell injury, are known to one skilled in the art and are contemplated by the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0055] Using the assay systems of the invention, it is possible to diagnose subjects at early, for<br>
example, pre-symptomatic or prodromic, stages of neurological disease. It is further possible,<br>
using the methods of the invention, to identify subjects or populations at risk for loss of<br>
cognition by detecting the encephalotoxin in a biological sample of a subject. The methods of<br>
the invention also allow monitoring of progression of neurological disease by detecting increases<br>
in encephalotoxin levels of a subject over time. The patients or subjects to be diagnosed in<br>
accordance with the present invention include and are not limited to mammals such as humans,<br>
primates such as and not limited to monkey, chimpanzee, and ape, rodents, such as and not<br>
limited to rat and mouse, guinea pig, dog, cat, rabbit, and pig. Biological samples in accordance<br>
with the methods of the invention include central nervous system tissue, such as brain or spinal<br>
cord tissue, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The neurological diseases to be identified or monitored<br>
according to the invention include neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory diseases such as,<br>
but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, HTV-1 associated dementia<br>
(HAD), Mild Cognitive Impairment, prion disease, mild cognitive/ motor dysfunction, acute<br>
stroke, acute trauma, neuro-AIDDS, and immune-mediated brain inflammation.<br>
[0056] The methods of the present invention include a neurotoxin assay of a biological sample<br>
of a patient, which can be used to diagnose a neurological disease or disorder or risk for loss of<br>
cognition in the subject. The methods of the present invention also may be used as an early<br>
detection method to identify individuals who are at risk for developing neurological diseases or<br>
disorders in view of their age, family history, early symptoms or other risk factors. For example,<br>
a biological sample, such as blood, spinal cord tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, or brain tissue, may be<br>
taken from a patient and evaluated with the encephalotoxin inactivators of the present invention,<br>
as described herein, to identify the presence of encephalotoxins in the patient or to identify<br>
patients who may suffer from a neurological disease. The patient's sample may be compared to a<br>
control to determine whether elevated levels of neurotoxins are present.<br>
[0057] Similarly, the methods of the present invention employ the neurotoxin inactivators of<br>
the invention to monitor a patient's treatment or the rate of progression of a disease by<br>
determining the amount of neurotoxins that are present in the patient's system before and<br>
throughout treatment. The methods may also be used to monitor neurotoxin levels to allow for<br>
the adjustment of drug doses.<br>
[0058] For example, the present invention provides methods for assaying the presence and<br>
level of encephalotoxin in a patient by contacting a biological sample of the patient with an<br>
encephalotoxin inactivator, such as heparin lyase I, N-sulfaminidase, glucosamine-6-suIfatase, or<br>
nitrous acid. Thereafter, the amount of inhibition in the presence of the inactivator is compared<br>
to a measured control. There is an increase of encephalotoxin in the subject when there is an<br>
increase in the encephalotoxin level compared to the control.<br>
[0059] The present invention offers strategies for early detection of neurodegenerative disease<br>
or risk for loss of cognition, thereby allowing early intervention in disease progression. The<br>
following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Purification of encephalotoxin<br>
[0060] Encephalotoxins were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid by HPLC sieving chromatrophy<br>
(TSK-GEL G2500PWXL column; 7.8 x 300mm from Tosoh Bioscience; Montgomeryville, PA)<br>
eluted with 2 M NaCl; by anion exchange HPLC (tandem ProPac PA1 columns 4 x 250 mm<br>
from Dionex Corp.; Sunnyvale, CA) with a linear gradient of 2 M NaCl over 180 min; or by<br>
adsorption chromatography (Oasis Cartridges, Waters) using the manufacturer's protocol.<br>
Structural characterization and inactivation of encephalotoxin<br>
[0061] Structural characterization and inactivation of encephalotoxin (isolated by organic<br>
extractions, gel filtration, and sequential CIS HPLC from Ab-stimulated microglial cell line<br>
BV2) was performed by various nitrous acid cleavage protocols. Neurotoxic activity was<br>
eliminated by nitrous acid treatment at pH 1.5 but not by other acid treatments at pH 4.0 or with<br>
h3'drazinolysis (Figure 1). The results indicated that the internal structure of encephalotoxin<br>
contained at least one GlcNS residue. Encephalotoxin chemical structure was further examined<br>
by treatments with highly selective enzymes that attack heparin or heparan sulfate (HS)<br>
polymers. Traditionally, heparin lyase I acts primarily on heparin-containing<br>
GlcNS(l-&gt;4)IdoA2S sequences and heparin lyase in on HS primarily at a GlcNAc(l-&gt;4)IdoA<br>
or GlcNAc(l-&gt;4)GlcA sequence. (Generally, these enzymes require oligomers of at least 4<br>
residues.) Finally, encephalotoxin was treated with sulfatases that are highly selective for O-<br>
sulfation sites at positions 2, 3, or 6 (found in HS and heparins) as well as N-sulfamidase which<br>
cleaves the N-sulfation site (Figure 1). Heparin lyase I [GlcNS(l-&gt;4)IdoA2S], but not heparin<br>
lyase HI, inactivated encephalotoxin as did sulfatases that removed groups from O-6S and<br>
GlcNS. Additionally, chemical methods to modify terminal amines (acetylation, PFPA<br>
modification, etc.) suggested the presence of terminal amines, such as unsubstituted GlcN<br>
residues. Accordingly, encephalotoxin contains heparin-like oligosaccharides of at least 4<br>
residues with GlcNS, IdoA2S, GlcN residues plus O-linked sulfation at position 6.<br>
[0062] Molecular mass of the neurotoxin was estimated using a TSK-GW2500PXL with a<br>
linear sieving range from 300 to 3000 daltons. Commercially available heparan oligomers were<br>
used as standards. CSF samples (100 ml) from probable AD showed a minor peak and major peak<br>
of neurotoxic activity having low molecular weight ranging in size from about 700 to 1,900<br>
daltons. These estimated molecular masses suggest oligosaccharides from about 4 to 8 residues<br>
in length (Figure 2).<br>
Neurotoxin bioassay<br>
[0063] Cultured neurons prepared from rat hippocampus were used in toxicity studies. These<br>
cultures consist of process-bearing neurons (10-20% of total cell population) atop a bed of<br>
astroglia (&gt;70%) mixed with microglia (5-10%). In order to eliminate microglia, cultures were<br>
exposed to saporin coupled to acetylated LDL at 10 mg/ml for 18 hours. At the end of 72 hrs, the<br>
cultures were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 12 hours and immuno-<br>
stained by overnight incubation with a mixture of anti-neurofilament antibodies (SMI-311,<br>
1:150; RT-97, 1:150; Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.;) plus anti-MAP-2 (1:200; Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, 184959;) at 4°C in the presence of 2% horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 to<br>
delineate both neuronal cell bodies and neurites. Immuno-labeled cells per field were scored at<br>
200X magnification using fluorescence microscopy. Neuron killing was expressed as % mean<br>
survival expressed in terms of parallel untreated control cultures after scoring at least 8 randomly<br>
selected fields for each of 3 coverslips.<br>
[0064] 1 ml of CSF was fractionated by adsorption chromatography, dried under vacuum, and<br>
reconstituted in artificial CSF comprising electrolytes, such as NaCl, and glucose . Increasing<br>
amounts of fractionated toxin (range 0.1 to 500 ml equivalents of original sample volume) were<br>
added to triplicate cultures. Results were plotted as volume vs. % neuron kill (with kill<br>
calculated as % loss of immuno-stained hippocampal neurons against untreated control cultures).<br>
Inactivation, for example, by heparin lyase I, N-sulfaminidase, glucosamine-6-sulfatase, or<br>
nitrous acid treatment, was used to confirm the presence of encephalotoxin for each CSF sample<br>
tested. As shown in Figure 3, high levels of toxin (curves shifted to left) for AD, intermediate<br>
levels (curve shifted to right) for MCI, and toxin-free (flat line) profiles were noted for samples<br>
taken from disease controls. In order to compare different populations, a CSF Neurotoxicity<br>
Index was developed to assign scores that reflect level of neurotoxin. This index was calculated<br>
as an ED50 (the equivalent CSF volume that yields 50% of the maximal level of neuron killing).<br>
Using this measurement, high neurotoxin levels have low Index scores; for example, high toxin<br>
concentrations have low Index scores of about 1, intermediate levels at about 5 to 100, and<br>
normal elderly show values of 1000.<br>
Encephalotoxin chemical assay<br>
[0065] Anion-exchange HPLC conditions for the detection of encephalotoxin were established<br>
(0.0-0.7 m NaCl gradient; ProPAK PA-1 column; 232 nm UV monitoring). The microglial cell<br>
line BV2 was exposed to human Api-42 for 48 hr and the conditioned media fractioned by<br>
absorption chromatography. Three biologically-active peaks (PEAKs 38, 48, and 53) were<br>
recovered that corresponded to 3 peaks detected by 232 nm (Figure 4A). All 3 peaks were<br>
sensitive to nitrous acid pH 1.5 and to heparin lyase I (data not shown). Importantly, none of<br>
these peaks were recovered from control cultures of unstimulated BV2 cells (Figure 4B).<br>
Encephalotoxin as CSF Biomarker for Neurodegenerative Disease<br>
[0066] Using ventricular CSF from rapid autopsy cases, encephalotoxin was determined to be<br>
present in high concentrations in all CSFs from AD cases (confirmed by pathology), but not in<br>
cases from age-matched normals or ALS (Figure 5). Importantly, lumbar CSF taken from<br>
subjects with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD also showed a striking pattern, with very high<br>
Encephalotoxin concentrations measured as ED50S of between 0.1 to 5 ul.<br>
[0067] A research protocol was established to evaluate samples not only from elderly subjects<br>
with cognitive impairment, but also from other groups seen by our clinic neurologists. The latter<br>
populations consisted of various diagnostic categories, with the largest groups suffering from<br>
headache variants, multiple sclerosis, or non-AD dementia (vascular, trauma). [Neurotoxin<br>
assays on these latter populations were performed with subject consent on remnant aliquots of<br>
CSF acquired for other clinical indications.] Data obtained thus far from subjects show that all<br>
patients with probable AD have high levels of neurotoxin, with ED50S for equivalent CSF<br>
volumes ranging from 0.5 to 15 ml (note that lower ED50 volumes indicate higher toxin<br>
concentrations); elderly subjects with MCI had ED50 of between 50 and 200 ml. The non-<br>
parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA for ranks showed neurotoxin levels significantly<br>
differed (as measured by ED50S) among tested disease groups (probable AD, MCI, non-AD<br>
dementia, headache, and MS; p=0.000001). The Kruskal-Wallis multiple-comparison test<br>
showed that both AD and MCI neurotoxin levels were significantly greater than these levels<br>
found in MS, headache, or non-AD dementia (p
[0068] Overall, these observations revealed several important trends. First, subjects with<br>
probable AD had the highest toxin concentrations, falling within a narrow range, similar to that<br>
of ventricular CSF from AD autopsy cases. Second, severe cognitive impairment or dementia<br>
secondary to non-inflammatory mechanisms (vascular, post-trauma) did not show detectable<br>
amounts of encephalotoxin in the CSF. [While neurotoxin can be found in tissues damaged<br>
acutely after stroke or trauma, these neurotoxin levels dissipate as the acute inflammatory<br>
response dissipates (about 3 to 7 days post injury; Giulian et al. (1990) Ann. NeuroL, 27: 33-42;<br>
Giulian et al. (1993) Stroke, 24: 84-93; Giulian (1993) Glia, 7: 102-110)]. And third, there<br>
appeared to be a trend of MCI subjects showing significant amounts of encephalotoxm, but only<br>
1/10 to 1/100 as much total toxic activity as found in AD CSFs (Figure 5).<br>
[0069] To determine whether oligosaccharides associated with encephalotoxin were also found<br>
in human CSF, encephalotoxin was isolated from CSF by adsorption chromatography and treated<br>
with the same heparin lyases, nitrous acid treatments, and sulfatases as used for microglia culture<br>
media. Ventricular CSF from AD cases and lumbar CSF from probable AD subjects<br>
demonstrated the same inactivation profiles (Figure 1), indicating that encephalotoxin in human<br>
disease contained heparin-like oligomers. Confirmation of the presence of such neurotoxic<br>
oligosaccharides came from anion-exchange HPLC, showing the presence of a neurotoxic PEAK<br>
38 recovered from microglial encephalotoxin fractions. There were similarities between the CSF<br>
samples from AD and MCI by anion-exchange profiles (PEAKS 38 and 48) with an additional<br>
PEAK 53 in the MCI group (Figure 6) as noted in microglial cultures (Figure 4).<br>
[0070] HPLC-profiles for ventricular cerebrospinal fluid of cases of definite AD were nearly<br>
identical to lumbar fluid samples from volunteers with probable AD (Figure 7B) and from those<br>
with HAD (Figure 7C). Enzymatic treatments by heparin lyase I and by N-sulfarnindase<br>
eliminated all these peaks of neurotoxicity. Neuron-killing activity recovered by anion-exchange<br>
HPLC was insensitive to heparin lyase n (Figure 7B), proteases, or heparin lyase HI treatments<br>
(data not shown).<br>
[0071] In order to survey the prevalence of neurotoxin production in neurological disorders,<br>
the cerebrospinal fluid of subjects from various disease populations was examined. Neurotoxin<br>
concentrations, expressed as CSF Neurotoxicity Index scores [expressed as equivalent volume of<br>
CSF which yields 50% of a total neuron killing effect in a standardized rat hippocampal culture<br>
assay], show that only those subjects with definite AD (postmortem diagnosis; n=7) or HTV-1<br>
infection (n=52) had detectable levels of CSF neurotoxin (Figure 8A). Neurologic disorders that<br>
can elicit chronic reactive immune responses, such as multiple sclerosis (MS; n=20),<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; n=8), or neuropathies (n=14), had no CSF neurotoxin.<br>
Similarly, subjects with psychiatric illness (n=5), with headache (n=6), or a variety of other<br>
neurological diseases (n=21; including fungal meningitis and neurosyphilis) are free of<br>
detectable neurotoxin. And finally, CSF samples obtained from volunteers undergoing routine<br>
myelography (n=20) contained no neurotoxin activity.<br>
Neurotoxicity Index values for CSF in cases of definite AD ranged between 1 and 10 whereas a<br>
broader distribution appeared for the HTV(+) population (0.1 to 1000). To investigate the wider<br>
distribution of neurotoxin levels for the HTV-1(+) cohort, 7 coded lumbar CSF samples from the<br>
HIV-1(+) volunteers who had undergone extensive medical, neurological, and<br>
tieuropsychological evaluations were obtained through the Texas unit of the National Neuro-<br>
AIDS Tissue Consortium (Morello et al. (2001) Neuropath. Appl. Neurobiol, 27:326-335).<br>
Neurotoxins are detected in those subjects with cognitive dysfunction (n=4) but not in those<br>
found to have normal cognition (n=3; Fisher's Exact Test, p=0.02S). Low CSF Neurotoxicity<br>
Index scores were detected in HIV(+) subjects with HAD (range from 0.1 to 4.0); high Index<br>
scores were detected in HTV(+) subjects with little or no cognitive impairment (all &gt; 200), and<br>
intermediate Index scores (1.0 to 21.0) were associated with HIV(+) subjects identified with mild<br>
cognitive-motor disorder (MCMD;Working Group of American Academy of Neurobiology<br>
AIDS Task Force (1992) Neurology, 41:778; Figure 8B). Significant differences between<br>
MCMD (median 7.3; mean +/- SE, 9.0 +/- 2.7; n=8) and HAD (0.1 median; 0.8 +/- 0.3; n=14)<br>
for Index values show a high confidence level (p=0.0001; Kruskal Wallis). The separation<br>
between HTV-1(+) subjects with MCMD group and those without cognitive impairment (median<br>
1000.0; mean 900 +/- 99.7 ul; n=8) is also significant (p=0.001). The degree of HIV injury to the<br>
CNS reflects levels of CSF neurotoxin, implying causal relationships among cognitive<br>
impairment, stage of brain pathology, and the production of neuron poisons.<br>
[0072] In order to determine whether neurotoxin levels also reflect cognitive decline in the<br>
aged population, CSF was obtained from elderly volunteers with Mild Cognitive Impairment of<br>
the amnestic type (MCI; objective memory deficit, but without dementia; Bischkopf et al. (2002)<br>
Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 106:403-414; n=6), a condition of impaired memory thought to reflect an<br>
early stage of AD (DeKosky et al. (2003) Science, 302:830). Comparison of subjects with MCI<br>
to elderly volunteers serving as controls (&gt;70 years old and free of memory complaints; n=8)<br>
showed marked differences between the groups (Figure SC). The Neurotoxicity Index scores for<br>
MCI ranges from about 7 to 20 (median 10.0; mean 11.5 +/-1.6; n=6) and are significantly lower<br>
than those measured for elderly controls (all &gt; 1000; n=8; Kruskal-Wallis; p=0.0005). Index<br>
scores for volunteers with probable AD (defined by clinical criteria) show a range of values from<br>
0.1 to 10 (median 1.7, mean 3.0 +/- 0.8; n=21). Probable AD and MCI values are also<br>
significantly different (p=0.0lll; Kruskal-Wallis), further evidencing an association between<br>
levels of CSF encephalotoxin and stage of brain pathology underlying cognitive dysfunction.<br>
Importantly, other forms of dementia lacking chronic brain inflammation, such as those<br>
secondary to trauma, alcoholism, or vascular injury, produce little or no detectable CSF<br>
neurotoxin (median 1000; mean 933.0 +/- 66.6; n=12). These observations are in agreement with<br>
CSF encephalotoxin values found in autopsy-confirmed cases for definite AD (Figure 8A) and<br>
for vascular dementia (Figure 8A).<br>
[0073] In order to classify groups according to CSF neurotoxin concentrations, discriminant<br>
analyses were applied to three diagnostic categories for HIV(+) subjects and three categories for<br>
the elderly. As shown in Table 1, the CSF Neurotoxicity Index accurately predicts which HIV(+)<br>
volunteers will have little or no impairment in cognition (cut-off &gt;100) from among those groups<br>
with MCMD (1-100) or HAD (
Alzheimer's dementia (cut-off &gt;100) from the elderly with MCI or AD. A cut-off value of &gt;100<br>
also predicts with 100% accuracy those elderly without memory complaints (see Figure 8C).<br>
CSF Encephalotoxin as a Biomarker for Progression of Disease Pathology<br>
[0074] Data from 164 subjects showed that all patients with AD have high levels of neurotoxin<br>
in the CSF with ED5Os for equivalent CSF volumes ranging from 0.5 to 15 ml Elderly subjects<br>
Iwith mild cognitive impairment had levels between 50 and 200 ml. Subjects with various other<br>
neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, had no detectable toxicity (ED5Os &gt;<br>
1000 ml); vascular and post-trauma non-AD dementia also had no toxic activity. HIV-1 (+)<br>
subjects demonstrated,a wide range of toxin concentrations (ED5Os ranging from 0.6 ul to &gt;1000<br>
ml-<br>
[0075] CSF from 40 HTV-1 (+) individuals was examined. The level of toxicity was associated<br>
with the degree of cognitive impairment. For example, HTV-l (+) subjects with normal<br>
cognition showed ED50s&gt;1000 ml, while those with moderate to severe cognitive defects<br>
produced neurotoxin levels of 0.6 to 5 ml, similar to the range found for AD subjects with<br>
established dementia.HIV-1 (+) subjects with mild to moderate cognitive impairments had<br>
intermediary levels of CSF neurotoxin with ED50S ranging from 10 to 300 ml.<br>
[0076] The Neurotoxicity Index in a variety of diagnostic groups was measured and compared<br>
against definite AD (n=7; defined by neuropathologic diagnosis using ventricular CSF obtained<br>
post mortem). As shown in Figure 8A, there is a striking difference between AD and other<br>
diagnostic categories lacking measurable toxin (Index scores of 1000), thus evidencing the value<br>
of the Neurotoxicity Index across a broad population. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 9, CSF<br>
encephalotoxin levels are clearly different among elderly without memory complaints or non-AD<br>
dementia (vascular, post traumatic, neurosyphillis) when compared to MCI (with amnestic<br>
features) or probable AD populations (using NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria).<br>
Discriminant analyses (Table IB) established cut-off Neurotoxicity Index values for AD at 
and for MCI at 4 to 100, providing the ability to correctly assign diagnosis based upon toxin<br>
values for MCI or probable AD against other groups. The underlying pathological process<br>
advances as a subject moves from a pre-symptomatic state to mild impairment (MCI with a 1.5<br>
SD drop below norms of a standardized memory test) and then to a more advanced stage with<br>
dementia (AD with a 2 SD drop below norms in memory and at least one other domain). Earlier<br>
stages of disease prior to significant memory loss (stages before diagnosis of MCI) involve the<br>
neuron-damaging immune cascade which is detectable by the presence of CSF encephalotoxin.<br>
This subclinical stage is the prodromic phase of AD pathology.<br>
[0077] Correlation between toxin levels and clinical manifestations of disease progression has<br>
been elucidated. MCI and mild AD subjects (MMSE &gt; 20; CDR 
encephalotoxin were subjected to a detailed neuro-cognitive battery. Simple linear regression<br>
analyses were carried out comparing Neurotoxicity Index values with T scores from sets of<br>
standardized tests representing major cognitive domains. (T scores are normalized to 50 with 10<br>
as SD; raw scores are adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and education level). As shown in<br>
Table 2, a highly significant correlation exists between Index scores and abnormal memory; that<br>
is, higher concentrations of toxin are found in those subjects with greater memory deficits while<br>
other cognitive domains (abstraction, language, processing speed) are not.<br>
[0078] Table 3 compares CSF Neurotoxin Index values and T scores for specific cognitive<br>
tests among HIV-1(+) volunteers (n=33). Confidence levels are based upon linear regression<br>
analyses and show that cognitive defects with domains of attention/information processing and<br>
learning/memory are closely associated with the amount of CSF encephalotoxin, while language<br>
and motor function are not. Prior to analysis, the Neurotoxicity Index was log transformed so<br>
that data would follow an approximate normal distribution.<br>
Examine effects of suppressive agents for microglia upon CSF encephalotoxin levels<br>
[0079] Use of encephalotoxin as a biomarker for monitoring drug treatment and disease<br>
progression was examined in a 6-week double-blind randomized study comparing several drugs<br>
against placebo with the primary endpoint as change in encephalotoxin levels in the CSF.<br>
Despite the masking of group assignments, a striking pattern was identified, as shown by<br>
representative data in Figure 10. Although some subjects receiving coded drugs showed<br>
reduction in toxin levels by about 10-fold, such decreases did not shift subjects into the range of<br>
Index scores found among normal elderly (that is, Index scores remained below the MCI cut-off<br>
values of 100). These data suggested that none of the active drugs used in this trial were<br>
adequately dosed to provide complete neuroprotection. The persistence of significantly abnormal<br>
encephalotoxin concentrations made it unlikely that a single drug trial would alter the clinical<br>
course of AD.<br>
[0080] A secondary endpoint was used to assess the ability of drug treatments to reduce Ab-<br>
induced toxicity in cultured blood monocytes. It was found in animal studies that blood<br>
mononuclear phagocytes reflect brain microglial responses to Ab. Accordingly, drug responses<br>
in cultures of blood monocytes having a baseline toxicity measure in enrolled subjects prior to<br>
drug treatments were examined after entry into the masked single drug trial. Study of 76<br>
monocyte samples with measurement of Ap-induced toxicity have shown the following:<br>
1) in some cases a single drug (identity masked) completely suppress<br>
AP-activation of blood monocytes;<br>
2) single drugs that suppress blood monocytes offer only a partial<br>
inhibition of CSF encephalotoxin levels;<br>
3) ex vivo studies using blood monocytes from subjects without<br>
evidence of drug suppression demonstrated exquisite sensitivity to<br>
DAP/HCQ combinations at 1/10 doses.<br>

sample is taken at a later timepoint than said first biological sample<br>
and following treatment of said neurological disease; wherein said<br>
encephalotoxin comprises an oligosaccharide comprising at least<br>
one glucosamine having N-sulfation and O6-sulfation, lacks<br>
peptide bonds, and has a molecular weight of less than 2000<br>
daltons; and wherein said decreased neuron survival is indicative<br>
of progression of said neurological disease.<br>
40. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said neurological<br>
disease is HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD), neuro-AIDS,<br>
Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, prion<br>
disease, mild cognitive/motor dysfunction, acute stroke, acute<br>
trauma, or Alzheimer's disease (AD).<br>
41. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said encephalotoxin<br>
has a molecular weight of 700 to 1900 daltons.<br>
42. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said encephalotoxin<br>
comprises 4 to 8 saccharide units.<br>
43. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said biological sample<br>
is cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord tissue, or brain tissue.<br>
44. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said subject is human,<br>
primate, bovine, equine, canine, feline, porcine, or rodent.<br>
45. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said subject is human.<br>
46. The method as claimed in claim 39 wherein said decreased neuron<br>
survival is detected by comparing the ED50 of said first biological<br>
sample with the ED50 of the second biological sample, wherein a<br>
lower ED50 of the second biological sample relative to the ED50 of<br>
the first biological sample is indicative to progression of said<br>
neurological disease.<br>
47. The method as claimed in claim 9, 17 or 25 wherein said biological<br>
sample comprises cerebrospinal fluid, brain tissue, or spinal cord<br>
tissue.<br>
48. The method as claimed in claim 9 or 25 wherein said subject is<br>
human, primate, bovine, equine, canine, feline, porcine, or rodent.<br>
49. The method as claimed in claim 48 wherein said subject is human.<br>
A method of detecting an encephalotoxin in a biological sample of a subject<br>
wherein said detecting comprises contacting a biological sample of said<br>
subject with neurons both in the presence of and in the absence of an<br>
encephalotoxin inactivator and comparing neuron survival in the presence of<br>
said encephalotoxin inactivator relative to neuron survival in the absence of<br>
said encephalotoxin inactivator, a decrease in neuron survival in the absence<br>
of said encephalotoxin inactivator being indicative of a neurological disease,<br>
the encephalotoxin being an oligosaccharide comprising at lease one<br>
glucosamine having N-sulfation and O6-sulfation; and encephalotoxin<br>
lacking peptide bonds; and said encephalotoxin having a molecular weight<br>
of less than 2000 daltons; the encephalotoxin inactivator being heparin lyase<br>
I, N sulfaminidase, glucosamine-6-sulfatase, or nitrous acid solution.</td>
