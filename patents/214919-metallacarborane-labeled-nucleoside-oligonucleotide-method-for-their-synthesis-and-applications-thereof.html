CENTRUM BIOLOGII MEDYCZNEJ POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK, a Poland company of ul. Lodowa 106, PL-93-232 Lodz, Poland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1151/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the area of synthetic organic chemistry, and in particular conjugates of<br>
nucleosides and oligonucleotides with boron clusters containing metals and other elements and<br>
theirs isotopes, their molecular structure and method of preparation and use.<br>
The invention concerns also application of carboranes and metallacarboranes as a new type of<br>
electrochernically active label for biological compounds. The derivatives labelledwith carborane or<br>
metallacarborane can be detected by electrochemical methods and may find several other practical<br>
applications, specifically as materials for nanoconstruction, in DNA array technology or for the<br>
construction of biosensors, especially electrochemical biosensors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nucleosides and nucleotides, components of nucleic acids, and oligonucleotides (short stretches of<br>
nucleic acids) find broad application among others in biology, medicine and nanotechnology<br>
[Agrawal, 1996; Cotter, 1996; Crooke, 1995; Ells, 1996; Jefferies and De ClercQ, 1995; Keller and<br>
Manalc, 1993; Niemeyer, 1997; Seeman et al, 1998; Wiedbrauk and Farkas, 1995);<br>
Due to the different requirements dependent upon specific applications of oligonucleotides and their<br>
components, natural nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides are modified in order to obtain<br>
molecules with designed and needed properties. Essentially all parts of nucleoside, nucleotide and<br>
oligonucleotide can be modified, namely sugar residue, nucleic base and phosphate group (Agrawal,<br>
1993; Micklefield, 2001; Shabarova and Bogdanov, 1994; Sanghvi and Cook, 1994; Uhlmann, E.,<br>
Peyman, A., 1990).<br>
One of the modifications is based on the use of boron clusters such as carboranes, as modifying<br>
entity. The carborane group can be attached to the nucleoside unit directly or through a linker. Most<br>
nucleosides modified with carborane group belong to pyrimidine nucleoside family. (Lesnikowski i<br>
Schinazi, 1995; Tjarks, W., 2000).<br>
Three types of carboranyl group (-C2B10H12) containing DNA-oligonucleotides have been described<br>
so    far:     1)    (o-carboran-l-yl)methylphosphonate-oligonucleotides    (CBMP-oligonucleotides),<br>
consisting carborane  cage  within internucleotide linkage (Lesnikowski  and Schinazi,   1993;<br>
Lesnikowski    et    al,    1997;    Lesnikowski,    2003),    2)    5-(0-carboran-l~yl)-2'-deoxyuridine-<br>
oligonucleotides   (CDU-oligonucleotides)   containing   carborane   cage   attached  to  nucleobase<br><br>
(Fulcrand-El Kattan et al, 1994; Lesnikowski et al 1996; Lesnikowski, 2003), and 3) V-0-(o-<br>
carboran-l-yl)methyl-oligonucleotides (2'-CBM-oligonucleotides) with carborane cage linked to<br>
sugar residue  at 2'  position  (01ejniCZak et al,  2002;  Olejniczak  and Lesnikowski,  2002;<br>
Lesnikowski, 2003). Other type of  modified nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides are<br>
derivatives of these compounds consisting metal complexes (Bigey et al., 1997; Dervan et al., 1988;<br>
Dougan et al., 1997; Dubey et al., 2000; Hurley and Tor, 1998; Ossipov et al, 2001; Strobel et al,<br>
1988; Yu et al, 2000). Nucleoside conjugates containing metal complexes with ligands other than<br>
£arhnrane cage or.nucleosides cxmtainhjg  carborane cage without metal ion have been described. For<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 6,180,766 discloses nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing boron<br>
clusters. Application of these derivatives as boron carriers for BNCT of tumors, antisense<br>
biotherapeutics and molecular probes in medical diagnostics are proposed.<br>
Application WO 2002053571 describes new derivatives of polycyclic hydrocarbons and naphtaleneimides type of ferrocene and methods of their synthesis, their intercalating properties, method for their electrochemical detection and several examples of practical applications. The disclosed compounds are easy for synthesis and purification, and are efficient intercalators towards double stranded DNA and RNA. However, as electrochemical label it binds to nucleic acid molecule through a weak intercalating interactions only what limits substantially practical utility of the proposed compounds.<br>
The subject of JP 2001064298 is preparation of oligonucleotide/ferrocene conjugates and their<br>
application for electrochemical detection of DNA. Disclosed is a method for synthesis of<br>
conductively or electrochemically active oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are transformed into<br>
organic solvent soluble form via ion pajr formation with suitable lipids and next are treated with a<br>
compound type of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid N-hydroxy succinimide ester. Though, in the<br>
above invention the method for the synthesis of oligonucleotide conjugates containing metal ion is<br>
described, it is limited to the incorporation into the oligonucleotide molecule iron only.<br>
In the application US 5599796 the method and compounds for treating urogenital tumors, and<br>
particular, cancer of the prostate, blader and kidney with BCNT, are disclosed. Preferred boron<br>
carriers include 5-carboranyl-2'-deoxyuridine (CDU) and 5-o-carboranyl-l-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-b-D-<br>
arabinofuranosyl)uracil (CFAU). Nucleosides and oligonucleotides bearing an -0-[(carboran-l-<br>
yl)alkyl]phosphate,	S-[(carboran~1-yl)alkyl]phosphorothioate,	or	Se-[(carboran-l-<br>
yl)alkjvl]nhosphoroselenoate in place of the (carboran-J -y))phosphoxate moiety can be used.<br><br>
Oligonucleotides of specific gene sequences that include one or more 3',5'-linking-(carboran-l-yl)phosphonate moieties can also be used in antisense therapy in the selective modification of gene expression.    The therapy is accomplished by administering the boron-contg. compd. By any appropriate route, including by i.v. injection, oral delivery or by catheter or other direct means, in such a manner that the compd. accumulates in the target tumor. After desired accumulation of the compd. in the tumor, the site is irradiated with an effective amt. of low energy neutrons. In the application JP 2002080491 preparation of electrophilic boron-containing nucleotide analogs and their  intermediates  is  disclosed.  Described     nucleotide  anlogues  of general  structure (HO)2BX[P(0)(0-)0]nNu (I; Nu = nucleoside residue; X = CF2, CH2; n = 2, 3) are prepared by difluoromethylation of HP(0)(ORl)2 (Rl = alkyl), reaction with (R20)3B (R2 = lower alkyl), deprotection, protection with 1,2-diols, coupling with nucleotides, and deprotection. Application US5130302 is focused on boronated nucleoside, nucleotide and oligonucleotide compounds, compositions and methods for using same. A novel class of pharmaceutically active boronated nucleosides are provided. The nucleosides are boronated at a nitrogen of the purine or pyrimidine ring or analogues thereof. Also provided are phosphate esters of these nucleosides and oligomers thereof. Methods of making and using of the boronated nucleosides are also disclosed. Both above applications provide method for the synthesis of some boron containing nucleoside derivatives, but does not allow incorporation of more than one boron atom per modification and does not permit incorporation into modified molecule other than boron metals. Patent US5466679 discloses carboranyl uridines and their use in BNCT. The invention relates to novel boron-containing nucleosides and amino acids which can utilize the enzymatic systems in tumor cells for incorporating such boron-containing structures into nucleic acids and proteins.<br>
»<br>
Subsequent use of boron neutron capture therapy provides a method for treatment of tumor cells. The subject of US5171849 is 2' and 3' carboranyl uridines and their diethyl ether adducts. There is disclosed a process for preparing carboranyl uridine nucleoside compounds and their diethyl ether adducts which exhibit a tenfold increase in boron content over prior art boron containing nucleoside compounds. Said carboranyl uridine nucleoside compounds exhibit enhanced lipophilicity and hydrophilic properties adequate to enable solvation in aqueous media for subsequent incorporation of said compounds in methods for boron neutron capture therapy in mammalian tumor cells. In the application US5405598 new sensitizing agents for use in boron neutron capture therapy are proposed. In spite that the compound proposed in the last three applications contain tenfold more<br><br>
boron atoms than described earlier derivatives consisting boric acid residue, but still twofold less, than proposed in the present invention. It should be also pointed out that any of the proposed so far methods does not allow incorporation into designed biomolecule such as nucleoside, nucleic acid or other a broad spectrum of different metal ions.<br>
Nucleic acid hybridization technology essentially began with the work of Hall and Spiegehnan (Hall and Spiegelman, 1961). Originally, probe and target were hybridized in solution and hybrids were isolated by equilibrium-density gradient centrifugation. This procedure was slow, labor-intensive and inaccurate. The substantial progress was achieved due to development the first solid phase hybridization method (Denhardt, 1966). Extensive studies during next 20 years yielded new, automated techniques for hybridization technology. The advancement was possible mainly due improved methods of DNA/RNA or DTSfA-oligonucleotide probes attachment to solid support and better methods of their labeling and detection (Keller and Manak, 1993). The most frequently used labels were radioactive isotopes such as P, H, C and S, fluorescent compounds and dyes absorbing in visible light, and the most often used test format was ELISA type immunoenzymatic assay. Comparison of selected methods are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Comparison of sensitivity of selected methods used for DNA detection.<br><br>
*Urdea MS., Warner BD., Running JA., Stempien M., Clyne J., Horn T., Nucl. Acids Res., 16,4937 (1988); bIhara T., Maruo Y, Takenaka S., Takagi M., Nucl. Acids Res., 24,4273 (1996).<br><br>
At the present stage of development of labeling and detection of oligonucleotide probes, and application of nucleic acids hybridization technology in research and medical diagnostics, an important role plays DNA chip technology and its application in genomics (Hoheisel, 1997; Anthony et al.., 2001; Lipshutz et al., 1995).<br>
Labelling of DNA-oligonucleotide probes with electrochemical labels and their application in electrochemical detection of nucleic acids was developed only recently. Earlier attempts to electrochemical detection of nucleic acids was based on detection of natural, unlabeled nucleic acid molecules (Wang^et al., 1997; Steel et al., 1998; Singhal andKuhr, 1997). Electrochemical detection of natural nucleic acids is however unspecific and characterized by high background. Because chemical similarities and alike nucleoside composition of oligonucleotide probes with different base sequences, selective detection of these probes without labelling is very difficult or impossible. In addition, detection of unlabeled oligonucleotide probes is hindered by the electrochemical activity of water. The ferrocene, is one of a very few electrochemical labels proposed for labelling of oligonucleotide probes (Ihara et al., 1996; Hiara et al., 1997). In this case however, the label is limited to the iron and its redox characteristics.<br>
Electrochemical detection of nucleic acids is disclosed in US 6391558 Bl patent dated May 21 2002. An electrochemical detection system which specifically detects selected nucleic acid segments is described. The system utilizes biological probes such as nucleic acid or peptide nucleic acid probes which are complementary and specifically hybridize with selected nucleic acid segments in order to generate a measurable current when an amperometric potential is applied. The electrochemical signal can be quantified. In the above invention electrochemical detection of only unlabeled nucleic acids and using only amperometric method is proposed.<br>
Nucleic acid detection method and apparatus, and vessel for detecting nucleic acid are subject of US 20020064795 Al patent dated May 30 2002. There is disclosed a nucleic acid detection app. including a nucleic acid immobilized electrode constituted by immobilizing a nucleic acid probe to a conductor, a plurality of vessels for bringing the nucleic acid probe into contact with a subject substance, a counter electrode disposed on a bottom surface or a inside surface of the vessel, and an elec. circuit for applying a voltage between the nucleic acid immobilized electrode and the counter electrode. A nucleic acid is detected by<br><br>
inserting the nucleic acid immobilized electrode into each vessel contg. the subject substance, and using the counter electrode disposed on the bottom surface or inside surface of the vessel to elec. control reaction.<br>
Quantitative detection of nucleic acids by differential hybridization using electrochemical labelling of samples is described in application JP 2002000299 A2 dated February 8 2002. A method for quant, detection of nucleic acids by differential hybridization using immobilized oligonucleotide probes complementary to nucleic acid samples labelled with conductive material, is disclosed. An elec. potential is applied and current is measured by differential p^ulse voltammog. DNA or PNA can be used as probes. Detection of ferrocene labelled oligonucleotides (20mer of adenine, A20) using thymine 20mer probe modified with mercapto hexyl group, or PNA thymine lOmer modified with l,2-bis(vinylsulfonyl acetamide) ethane, is described. Hybridization-based gene detection method using intercalator and electrochemical detection of immobilized probe is described in application WO2002/057488 dated January 21, 2002. The gene detection method according to the above invention is characterized in that an intercalator is introduced into the double strand, and the double strand is electrochem. detected. According to present method, a probe and a sample gene are hybridized in a uniform soln. or in a soln. in the vicinity of an electrode surface, an intercalator is introduced thereinto for labeling, the probe is then immobilized on the electrode, and the amt. of immobilized probe and the amt. of double strand are sep. detected at the same time, making it possible to accurately det. the amt. in which the double strand is produced per unit amt. of immobilized probe. An advantage of the present method is that reactions can be conducted with higher efficiency because the hybridization and intercalation are carried out in a soln. without immobilizing the probe on the electrode.<br>
Electrochemical detection of nucleic acid hybridization is a subject of application US6361951. A method of detecting a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA) that contains at least one preselected base (e.g., adenine, guanine, 6-mercaptoguanine, 8-oxo-guanine, and 8-oxo-adenine) comprises (a) reacting the nucleic acid with a transition metal complex capable of oxidizing the preselected base in an oxidation-reduction reaction; (b) detecting the oxidation-reduction reaction; and (c) determining the presence or absence of the nucleic acid from the detected oxidation-reduction reaction at the preselected base. The method may be used in a variety of applications, including DNA sequencing, diagnostic assays, and quantitative analysis.<br><br>
The requirement of the presence of one or more preselected nucleic bases in the detected DNA or RNA is an significant disadvantage of the above method. If the nucleic bases are present in the probe in nature (e.g adenine, guanine) the specificity of the detection is decreased, if they are incorporated into nucleic acids artificially - the additional procedure is required making the process of detection more complicated. The range of the redox potentials is also limited due to the preselection of nucleic bases, this makes impossible detection of several probes in the same mixture. Determination of sequence variations in nucleic acids by electrochemical detection of hybrids using , probes labelled with redox groups is described in application WO 2001/007665 A2. The present invention is directed to methods and compns. for the use of self-assembled monolayers to electronically detect nucleic acids, particularly alterations such as nucleotide substitutions (mismatches) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The method uses arrays of probes immobilized in self-assembling monolayers on an electrode surface. Probes and target sequences are labelled with redox groups and hybridization of the probe results in a change in redox potential. Prepn. of chips with probes immobilized via disulfide bridges to thiolated DNA is demonstrated and the effects of variables such as temp of hybridization are studied. Methods of using competimers, perfectly matching probes that will replace weak or unstable hybrids, to improve the specificity of the hybridization are described.<br>
Electrodes coated with metal complex-containing film and its use for electrochemical detection of nucleic acid bases is described in patent US 6180346 Bl. A modified electrode prepd. by electropolymg. a film on the conductive working surface of an electrode is disclosed. The coated electrode is used for electrochem. detection of nucleic acid bases. The electrode is modified by reductive electropolymn. of a thin film of poly[Ru(vbpy)32+] or poly[Ru(vbpy)32+/vba] (vbpy=4-vinyl-4'methyl-2,2,-bipyridine and vba=p-vinylbenzoic acid) and the electrode is used for the electrochem. detection of aq. GMP, poly[G], and surface-immobilized single-stranded DNA probes. A DNA probe is attached covalently to the carboxylate group via a carbodiimide reaction followed by amidation of an amino-linked single-stranded DNA. In the presence of these guanine contg. moieties, a dramatic enhancement in the oxidative current for the Ru3+/2+ couple (present in the polymeric thin film) due to the catalytic oxidn. of guanine is obsd. This invention shows example some metal complexes for detection of DNA proves their practical importance. Electrochemical detection of the hybridization process of a probe and target nucleic with the application of the catalyst of the redox reaction attached to electrode surface is described in the<br><br>
application WO 2001/021635 A2. In the disclosed method DNA- or PNA-oligonucleotideprobe containing catalyst of the redox reaction attached to the one end is linked to the electrode surface from the opposite side. Signal is generated as a result of hybridization of the target nucleic acid to the probe and formation of the double stranded structure allowing flow of the electric current from the electrode to the catalyst on the opposite end and initiation of the redox reaction. In this format hybridization process can be detected using voltametric, amperometric, potentiometric or conductometric methods. Electrochemical detection of the nucleic acid hybridization process with the application of the probes coupled with electrochemical label is a subject of the application WO 2000/031101 Al. This method can be successfully adapted for the application with the electrochemical labels being a subject of the present invention.<br>
Method for detecting/quantitating sample nucleic acid fragment by scanning electrochemical microscopy is described in application JP 2001013103 A2 dated January 19 2001. A highly sensitive method is provided for detecting/quantitating a sample nucleic acid fragment complementary to DNA or PNA fragment immobilized on the anal, element surface by scanning electrochem. microscopy using DNA or PNA anal, element. The sample nucleic acid is contacted with the DNA or PNA anal, element in the presence of a hybrid DNA (or PNA)-binding electrochem. active mol. (e.g, ferrocene-modified intercalate). Then, the sample nucleic acid fragment complementary to the DNA or PNA fragment immobilized on the anal, element as well as the electrochem. active mol. are bound to the anal, element. The complementary sample nucleic acid fragment is detected/quantitated by measuring the elec. current generated in the electrochem. active mol.-binding region on the anal, element surface upon applying an elec. potential to the anal, element surface by a scanning electrochem. microscope. This method can be successfully adapted for the application with the electrochemical labels being a subject of the present invention. An electrochemical method for detecting DNA using DNA sensor and intercalator is described in application JP 2000125865 A2 dated May 9 2000. The DNA sensor comprises more than two electrodes equipped with the resp. terminals for output. On the surface of the electrodes, DNA probes possessing the base sequences differing from each other are immobilized. On this DNA sensor, the sample DNA dissocd. into single chains are bound with the probe DNA in the presence of the electrochem. activity-embedded-type intercalator, or the intercalator is bound with the DNA hybrid formed beforehand. A DNA gene is detected by measuring the current generated through the intercalator trapped into DNA hybrid. The above method is similar to several methods mentioned<br><br>
earlier utilizing electrochemically labeled intercalating molecule. As a label for the intercalator molecule the electrochemical labels being a subject of the present invention can be also applied. The aim of the present invention is providing new and versatile electrochemical label being a boron cluster, favourably in the form of metal complex, typically metallacarborane and    modified nucleosides or their derivatives comprising thereof. Application of the metallacarborane group is especially desirable because it is characterized by unusually high boron contents, and it can accommodate in its structure a broad variety of other elements, specifically metals, their ions and isotopes. This increases substantially potential of the proposed new class of molecules beyond their use as electrochemical label and expand a range of their practical applications. This aims have been unexpectedly achieved in the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The nucleoside can contain purine as well as pyrimidine nucleic base, and be natural or modified entity. The provided nucleoside conjugates contain metal in the form of metallacarborane complex and consist from two up to eighteen times more boron than it was available so far. Because of unique properties of boron clusters they form complexes with a broad range of metals such as Sn, Mn, Tc, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Sc, Cr, Mg, Zr, Mo, Sm, Yb, Hf, W, Hg, Gd, U or Y and others and can include several nonmetals such as As, S, Si, Se, Te, P, Sb, Bi, Ge or N and theirs isotopes.

In contrast to the sandwich type compounds such as ferrocene, the number of metallacarborane of different structures, containing various metals is very high. The electrochemical properties of many metallacarborane complexes are known. The chemical nature of the new class of label provided in this invention makes possible incorporation into the label molecule of a range of different metals such as Sn, Mn, Tc, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, rr, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Y and others. This property increases dramatically the range of potential practical applications of the oligonucleotides containing metallacarborane label. Because of a great diversity of metals which can be included into the metallacarborane structure and a broad range of redox potentials characteristic for these metals, it • may be expected that the oligonucleotide probes labelled with different metallacarborane can be&gt; detected selectively in the mixture. This in turn, may be of importance for potential applications of metallacarborane labeled oligonucleotides in such technologies as nanotechnology, DNA-chips or.. DNA sensors.<br>

Derivative (of the nucleoside, nucleotide, oligonucleotide, protein, antibodies and other biological molecules) is a chemically or physically changed form of the mother molecule (substrate). DNA hybridization technology - the technologies and their applications based on specific formation of double stranded nucleic acid structure due to specific nucleic bases recognition according to Watson-Crick rule.<br>
DNA microarrays - terminologies that have been used in the literature to describe this technology include, but not limited to: biochip, DNA chip, DNA microarray, and gene array. Asymetrix, Inc. owns a registered trademark, GeneChip®, which refers to its high density, oligonucleotide-based DNA arrays. However, in some articles appeared in professional journals, popular magazines, and the WWW the term "gene chip(s)" has been used as a general terminology that refers to the microarray technology. Base-pairing (i.e., A-T and G-C for DNA; A-U and G-C for RNA) or<br><br>
hybridization is the underlining principle of DNA microarray. An array is an orderly arrangement of samples. It provides a medium for matching known and unknown DNA samples based on base-pairing rules and automating the process of identifying the unknowns. In general, arrays are described as macroarrays or microarrays, the difference being the size of the sample spots. Macroarrays contain sample spot sizes of about 300 microns or larger and can be easily imaged by existing gel and blot scanners. The sample spot sizes in microarray are typically less than 200 microns in diameter and these arrays usually contains thousands of spots.<br>
DNA sensor, is an immobilized DNA recognition element (receptor) coupled to a transducer unit and an electronic amplifier. Dependent on the kind of interaction beween the analyte (S) and the receptor (R) one differ entiates between: Affinity sensors (affinity to the substrate; S + R "" RS), metabolism sensors (use of the substrate; S + R "" RS "" P + R).<br>
Electrochemical DNA sensors, the device detecting hybridization process between target nucleic acid and nucleci acid probe. The DNA sensor comprises a nucleic acid recognition layer and a signal transducer. The signal transducer determine that that hybridization occurred on the base of the electrochemical process triggered by the hybridization and converts this into electronic signal Nanotechnology, the development and use of devices that have a size of only a few nanometres. Research has been carried out into very small components, many of which depend on quantum effects and may involve movement of a very small number of electrons in their action. Such devices would act faster than larger components. Considerable interest has been shown in the production of structures on a molecular level by suitable sequences of chemical reactions or lithographic techniques. It is also possible to manipulate individual atoms on surfaces using a variant of the atomic force microscope to make, for example, high density data storage devices. Nucleoside is defined as a compound consisting a five-carbon sugar molecule (a pentose, ribose or deoxyribose) and an organic base, purine or pyrimidine. Nucleotide is defined as a nucleoside consisting phosphate group.<br>

The oxidation step was performed using a tert-bntyl hydroperoxide solution (0.5 M, 1 mL) for 2 min. followed by washing with acetonitrile (1x5 mL) and drying under high vacuum. Oligonucleotides were then cleaved from the support by 1 h incubation with concentrated aqueous ammonia solution (30%, 1 mL) at room temperature then base deprotection was achieved by incubation of resultant solution at 50°C for 2K h. The solution of crude 5'-O-monomethoxytrityl protected oligonucleotide 8 and 5'-0-dimethoxytrityl protected oligomer 9 was degassed with a stream of argon and evaporated to dryness under vacuum, then redissolved in water. Resultant solution of crude 5'-0-protected oligonucleotides 8 and 9 having 33 and 64 A260 optical density units, respectively, were purified using HPLC dg reverse phase column (RP-HPLC) using conditions as follows: 20 min from 0 % B to 100 % B, 5 min 100 % B, 5 min from 100 % B to 0 % B. Fractions containing the desired product were collected, and the buffer was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was co-evaporated with 96% ethyl alcohol to remove triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), then detritylation was performed using a 80% acetic acid (1.0 mL) at room temperature for 20 min. Next the acetic acid solution was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the totally deprotected oligonucleotides were<br><br>
purified by RP-HPLC using conditions as above. Buffer A contained 0.1 M TEAB (pH 7.0) in a mixture of acetonitrile and water (2:98, v/v), buffer B contained 0.1 M TEAB (pH 7.0) in a mixture of acetonitrile and water 60:40 (v/v) for modified oligonucleotide 8 (condition I) and 40:60 (v/v) for unmodified oligonucleotide 9 (condition IT).
