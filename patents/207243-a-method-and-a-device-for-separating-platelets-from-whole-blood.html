The present invention relates to a method and a device for separating platelets from whole blood. More specifically, by separating platelets from whole blood, growth factor rich platelets can be harvested, concentrated, and delivered for wound healing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
An attractive emerging clinical approach for augmenting wound healing is the<br>
rapidly expanding clinical and surgical use of recombinant or autologous growth<br>
factors for improved therapeutic outcomes. Examples of areas where such wound<br>
healing compositions are useful include intractable decubitus and pressure ulcers;<br>
orthopedic bone defect repair and bone ingrowth in fixation and implantation<br>
procedures; plastic and maxillofacial surgery; burn skin grafts; connective tissue<br>
repair; periodontal surgery, etc., as described by: Knighton D R, Surgery, Gynecology<br>
&amp; Obstetrics 170: 56-60. 1990; and in Slater M, J Orthop Res 13: 655-663. 1995. The<br>
widespread clinical and surgical acceptance of growth factor-based wound healing<br>
therapies are currently limited to some degree by the high cost associated with both<br>
recombinant and autologous growth factor healants, and the additional inconvenience<br>
of processing autologous cells intraoperatively. Although only few controlled<br>
comparisons have been made between autologous growth factor cocktails and purified<br>
protein recombinant growth factors for wound healing *	———_—<br><br>
Alternatively, a wound healant for application to tissue can comprise a combination of platelet aggregates and single platelets, wherein the platelet aggregates and the single platelets are suspended in a physiological solution and carried by a clinical carrier substrate. An advantage of utilizing such a combination includes the possibility that aggregated platelets may provide immediate release of growth factor to a tissue, whereas individual, non-aggregated platelets may provide growth factor to a tissue site over time. Therefore, such a wound healant can provide immediate growth factor treatment to a tissue, as well as provide some sustained release of growth factor over time.<br>
In either of the above embodiments, substantially intact platelets can be delivered directly in, for example, a physiological solution such as isotonic saline solutions. In one embodiment of such a wound healant, the autologous platelets with contained growth factors can be present at a concentration greater than three times normal levels compared to that present in blood, wherein the platelet is not substantially activated by degranulating agents such as thrombin. Further, the physiological solution that acts as the wound healant can be essentially free of serum or plasma proteins.<br>
As described herein with respect to a process of the present invention, the platelets can be prepared and be present as single cells or small aggregates of cells that are distributed within a clinical carrier substrate, thereby providing a dispersed and prolonged release of growth factors. The healant can be delivered as suspended cells in a physiological solution, in a patch such as a poly-glycolic acid patch, a polyester patch such as a Darcon patch, or as a gel such as part of a gel suture system.<br><br>
Additionally, such a wound healant can also be combined with a hemostatic sealant to contribute growth-promoting properties of the wound healant. Further, such a wound healant can also be incorporated into aneurysm substrates or fillers such as coils or gels to accelerate the healing and/or re-integration of an aneurysm.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for separating platelets from whole blood, comprising: providing whole blood which includes platelets, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and blood plasma; selectively aggregating the platelets by adding an aggregating agent such as herein described to form platelet aggregates that are larger in size than said leukocytes and said erythrocytes; and substantially separating the platelet aggregates from the leukocytes, erythrocytes, and blood plasma in a known manner, washing said separated platelets disaggregating and for suspending the same in a desired solvent.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a device for separating platelets from whole blood, comprising: (i) a mixing chamber provided with a conventional mixing mechanism for mixing whole blood and aggregating agent, (ii) a filtering chamber for collecting platelet aggregates which allows the residual blood components to substantially pass, said filtering chamber being provided with filter means, (iii) a valve disposed between said mixing chamber and filtering chamber, (iv) said mixing chamber having an inlet for supplying whole blood and said aggregating agent, and an outlet for removing components of whole blood that are not collected in the filter.<br>
