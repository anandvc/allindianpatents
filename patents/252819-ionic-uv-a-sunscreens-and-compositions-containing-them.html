Ionic UV-A sunscreens and compositions containing them<br>
The present invention relates to novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives, to novel cosmetic or clermatological sunscreen compositions containing these derivatives and the use of these derivatives for photoprotecting human skin and/or hair against UV radiation, in particular solar radiation.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population which is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in the sunlighted protected sites of the body. Among damaging results of extensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosis, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sunscreen chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effect of UV-A (320 to 400 nm) and/or UV-B (290 to 320 nm) wavelength and even shorter wavelength (UV-C). These chemicals are usually incorporated either alone or in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used.<br>
In particular UV-A radiation causes a rapid, weak direct pigmentation of the skin. UV-A rays penetrate into deeper skin layers and there can accelerate the ageing process of the skin. The shorter wave UV-A II radiation assist the formation of sunburn. The UV-A radiation can furthermore cause phototonic or photoallergic skin reactions. There is a relationship between UV-A exposure and increased risk of skin cancer.<br>
While there exists a large number of safe and effective UV-B absorbers, the number of UV-A absorbers suitable for the protection of human skin is rather restricted. A good UV-A absorber should have excellent photostability, toxicological and dermatological acceptability, excellent heat stability, very good solubility in cosmetic solvents, in particular in oil or water, compatibility with cosmetic bases, pH stability in the range of 4 to 9, processability into cosmetic formulations, compatibility with other ingredients of cosmetic<br><br>
formulations and with the packaging materials, no staining of textiles, it should be free of<br>
•   color and of neutral or pleasant odor, and it should be free of tackiness and have a low<br>
volatility. In particular for application to hair such as in hairsprays, shampoos, hair care<br>
products, etc., high requirements must be met, and the UV-absorber must adhere to the<br>
.hair to provide sufficient protection.<br>
Oil-soluble sunscreens which absorb in the UV-A range are disclosed e.g. in WO 03/068183.<br>
While the number of available UV-A absorbers which meet at least some of the above requirements is already short, the number of UV-A absorbers which are hydrosoluble or which are suitable for application to the hair is even shorter. A hydrosoluble UV-A sunscreen has the advantage that it can be incorporated into the water phase of usual oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions. Since usually in those emulsions there is more water phase than oil phase, more sunscreen can be incorporated into the water phase than into the oil phase, which leads to compositions having a higher sunprotection factor. Furthermore, water-soluble UV-A sunscreens could be combined with known oil-soluble UV-A sunscreens in the oil phase of a two-phase emulsion, which again leads to an increase of the sunprotection factor.<br>
Water-soluble UV-A sunscreens are disclosed e.g. in EP-A 669 323 which discloses both water-soluble and oil-soluble sunscreens. However, the water-soluble UV-A sunscreens disclosed in this document, e.g. the compound disodium phenyldibenzimidazole tetrasulfonate have an absorption maximum at 335 nm and an extinction value E of only 745, which is relatively low. An absorption maximum between 350 to 370 nm would be preferable. Furthermore, it would be preferable to have UV-A sunscreens which are water-soluble and/or which advantageously adhere to hair which have a higher extinction E, which would improve the efficiency of the sunscreen. E values of more than 900, preferably more than 1000, e.g. 1000 to 1200, would be very advantageous.<br>
UV-A sunscreens are also disclosed in DE 33 24 735, and some of the sunscreens disclosed in this document are also water-soluble. An example of such a water-soluble UV-A sunscreen is terephthalylidene dicamphorsulfonic acid, however, this compound has an extinction coefficient E of only 866 , and the absorption maximum is at 345 nm.<br><br>
There still exists the need for further UV-A sunscreens which are water-soluble and/or adhere to hair which do not only meet the requirement for sunscreens as indicated above but which also have an absorption maximum at rather high wavelength, preferably between about 350 to 370 nm, and have excellent E values, preferably 900 or more, more preferably 1000 or more.<br>
This object is achieved by compounds of the general formula (I)<br>
wherein <br>
R1 and R2	are identical or different electron-withdrawing groups or one of R1 and<br>
R2 is hydrogen and the other of R1 and R2 is an electron-withdrawing group,<br>

Preferably at least one of residue R1 and residue R2 is a cyano group, most preferably both residue R1 and residue R2 each are a cyano group (CN group). It is also preferred that one residue is a cyano group and the other residue is a -COOR8 group.<br>
R3, R4, R5 and R6 are independently selected from hydrogen atoms, CrC10 alkyl groups, C2-Ci0 alkenyl groups, C2-C10 alkinyl groups, C3-C10 cycloalkyl groups and C6-Ci0 aryl groups. Each of these groups can be unsubstituted or substituted by one to three substituents selected from CrC6 atkyl groups, halogen, hydroxy and CrC6 alkoxy groups. Alternatively, it is also possible that R3 and R5 and/or R4 and R6 taken together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered ring which is optionally substituted with one to four substituents selected from CrC6 alkyl groups, C3-C6 cycloalkyl groups, C-i-Ce alkoxy groups, hydroxy or halogen.

It is also preferred that R3, R4, R5 and R6 are independently selected from hydrogen atoms and unsubstituted CrC6 alkyl groups, C2-C6 alkenyl groups, C5-C8 cycloalkyl groups and phenyl groups. If R3 and R5 and/or R4 and R6 are taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered ring, a 6-membered ring is preferred, and the rings are preferably unsubstituted or substituted with one substituent as defined above.<br>

It is important for the invention that residue X comprises at least one group, preferably one, two or three groups, which is positively or negatively charged. Preferably X is an alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl or alkylcycloalkyl group containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms and optionally 1 to 10 hetero atoms and comprising at least one group which is positively or negatively charged. The term "alkylaryl" or "alkylcycloalkyl" refers to an aryl or a cycloalkyl group which contains one or more alkyl substituents. Since the group X comprises at least one group which is positively or negatively charged, it will usually contain at least one hetero atom which bears the positive or the negative charge. Preferably residue X contains 1 to 6 hetero atoms, and the hetero atoms are preferably selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and phosphor atoms. If residue X is positively charged, it contains preferably at least one nitrogen atom which is positively charged, and thus the group which bears the positive charge is a quaternary ammonium group. Such compounds comprising a quaternary ammonium ion are particularly preferred for hair applications. If residue X contains a negatively charged group, the group which bears the negative charge is preferably an acid residue such as a residue of phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid or carboxylic acid.<br>
It is also possible that residue X contains 1 to 4 unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, preferably double bonds. Each carbon atom in residue X can optionally be substituted by a functional group, in particular by a hydroxyl or an amino group, preferably by a hydroxyl<br><br>
group. Preferably not more than three, more preferably not more than two carbon atoms of the residue X are substituted as defined above. Of course, if a carbon atom in residue X is substituted by an amino group, there can also be an unsaturated bond, preferably a double bond between the carbon atom and the nitrogen atom. It is also possible that residue X and residue Y together form a zwitter ion structure.<br>
If the group which is positively or negatively charged in residue X is negatively charged, residue X carries preferably a single negative charge and is most preferably an acid residue such as a group -O-SO3", -COO", -O-PO3H", -O-PO32", -SO3\ -PO3H" or -PO32'. Most preferred is group -O-SO3' , -SO3' and a group -O-PO3H\ Typical examples of residue X which comprise at least one group which is negatively charged are alkylene groups which are optionally substituted by a cycloalkyl group or an aryl group or which is interrupted by a cycloalkyl group or an aryl group and which contains an acid residue as defined above. In a preferred embodiment the alkylene group is interrupted by one to three hetero atoms, preferably selected from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The alkylene group contains preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. If the alkylene group is interrupted by a nitrogen atom, the nitrogen atom bears a further group R8 as defined above.<br>
A preferred example of a residue X having a single negative charge is a residue<br>
wherein each R9 is independently hydroxy or defined as residue RB above and preferably is a hydrogen atom, hydroxy or a C1-C3 alkyl group, V and U are independently of each other a hetero atom, preferably an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom (which carries a further group R8 as defined above), more preferably an oxygen atom, n is an integer of 0 to 6 (preferably 1 to 6), m is 0 or 1, 0 is an integer of 0 to 6 (preferably 1 to 6), p is 0 or 1, q is an integer of 0 to 6 (preferably 1 to 6) and W is the residue bearing a negative charge, preferably an acid residue as defined above, most preferably a residue -O-PO3H", a residue -SO3~ or a residue -O-SO3", with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms is 20 or less, preferably 10 or less, most preferably 1 to 6 and with the proviso that the total number of hetero atoms in residue X is 1 to 10, including the hetero atoms of functional group W, and with the proviso that index o is not 0, if index m and index p are both 1. Preferably not more than four<br><br>
residues R9, more preferably not more than two residues R9 are different from hydrogen, most preferably all residues R9 are hydrogen.'<br>
Another preferred example of a residue X having a single negative charge is a residue<br>
-Ar -W,<br>
wherein Ar is an aromatic group, preferably a C6-C10 aromatic group, e.g. a phenylene or naphthylene group or a heterocyclic group, preferably a ring with 4 to 10 members, of which one or more, preferably 1 or 2, members are hetero atoms, preferably N, O or S atoms. The heterocyclic group can be saturated or unsaturated and hetero aromatic groups such as a pyridinylene group are also encompassed. W is as defined above.<br>
It is also preferred that the at least one group which is positively or negatively charged in residue X is a group which has one positive charge. Most preferably this group which has one positive charge is a quaternary ammonium ion. In this case, residue X is preferably a residue of the formula<br><br>
wherein each R10 is independently hydrogen or R11 and each R11 is independently defined as residue R8 above, preferably is hydrogen, a CrC10, preferably Ci-C6 alkyl group which may be interrupted by 1 to 4 hetero atoms, preferably by 1 or 2 hetero atoms, preferably by oxygen atoms and which may be substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from hydroxy groups, amino groups and Ci-C6 alkyl, preferably C1-C3 alkyl groups, and index r is an integer from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 6, with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms in residue X is 20 or less, preferably 1 to 10, and that the total number of hetero atoms including the nitrogen atom and all hetero atoms of functional groups is 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4. Compounds comprising at least one quaternary ammonium ion as defined above are particularly useful for hair applications such as hair care products, shampoo, hair sprays, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, residue R11 may contain a negative charge and therefore encompass residue Y, e.g. one residue R11<br><br>
can be an alkyl group which is substituted with a functional group bearing a negative charge such as an -SO3* group or a similar group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, residue XY is a zwitter ion having a positive charge and a negative charge, the number of carbon atoms, heteroatoms and functional groups being as defined above.<br>
The exact structure of residue X is not relevant, as long as it contains at least one positive or negative charge which makes the molecule water-soluble and/or which provides good adhesiveness to hair. Preferably, X contains one, two or three positive or negative charges.<br>
Residue Y is a counterion which should balance the charge of residue X. The exact chemical nature of the counterion Y is not important for the invention, as long as counterion Y does not negatively interfere with the advantageous properties of the UV-A absorbent and in particular as long as Y is dermatologically and cosmetically acceptable. If residue X is negatively charged, residue Y is preferably a quaternary ammonium ion, an alkali metal or an earth alkali metal ion, more preferably a sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium ion, but it is also possible that residue Y is a positively charged organic residue, e.g. an ammonium ion such as a triethanol ammonium ion, an aminomethyl propanol ion or a tromethamine ion. If residue Y has more positive charges than residue X has negative charges, residue Y contains a further counterion which balances the additional charge or more than one residue X is balanced by one residue Y. For example, residue Y can be<br>
1<br>
— (Ms+) or Ms+(A')s,i, wherein Ms+ is an ion with s positive charges and A" is an ion with a<br>
5<br>
single negative charge, e.g. a halogen atom, and s is 1 to 3, preferably 1 or 2, more preferably 1.<br>
If residue X is positively charged, residue Y is negatively charged and preferably residue Y is a halogen atom, such as a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. If residue Y has more negative charges than residue X has positive charges, residue Y contains a further counterion which balances the additional charge or more than one residue X is balanced by<br>
1<br>
one residue Y. For example, residue Y can be — (Ms~) or Ms"(A+)s_i, wherein Ms' is an ion<br>
s<br>
with s negative charges and A+ is an ion with one positive charge, e.g. an alkali metal ion, and s is 1 to 3, preferably 1 or 2, more preferably 1.<br><br>
If residue X carries more than one charge, more than one counterion Y can be present or residue Y carries more than one countercharge. It is important that residue Y is selected so that the total molecule of the formula I is not charged.<br>
It is also possible that X and Y are chemically bonded together, such as in moieties as -(CH2)rN+(R11)2-(CH2)t-SO3', with r is as defined above and t is an integer of 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 5, e.g. 2. In such embodiments, residues X and Y together form a zwitter ion<br>
structure.<br>
Preferably residues R1 to R6, X and Y are selected so that the molecule has a water-solubility of at least 10 g/l, preferably at least 50 g/l, more preferably at least 100 g/l. If the water-solubility of a compound of formula I is not sufficiently high, the substitution pattern can be changed, e.g. the number of carbon atoms in residues R3 to R6 can be reduced, aryl or cycloalkyl residues which can reduce the water-solubility can be removed from some or all of the residues, and hydrophilic substituents such as hydroxy groups can be included.<br>
Compounds which have a particularly high adherence to hair, such as the quaternary ammonium ions of the formula -C(R102)r-N+(R11)3 as defined above, may have a lower water-solubility.<br>
Preferred compounds of the present invention are<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where X' is a precursor structure of XY.<br>
Phosphate residues of the type -O-PO32" can for example be prepared from the corresponding alcohol function using e.g. POCI3 with a base as e.g. triethylamine [see e.g. M.-Z. Liu et al.f Carbohydr. Res. 330 (3), 413-420 (2001)], with P2O5 and H3PO4 [see e.g. K. Buss et al., J. Med. Chem. 44 (19), 3166-3174 (2001)] or by enzymatic methods.<br>

which is unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 3 substituent groups R8 as defined above, have a particularly high water-solubility and those compounds of formula (I) are especially preferred.<br>
The present invention also relates to compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) formulated into a suitable support or substrate. Typically the compositions of the invention are adopted for protecting a material that is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, in particular solar radiation, and comprises an effective photoprotective amount of at least one of the compounds of formula (I). In one preferred embodiment of the invention such compositions are suited for protecting the skin and/or hair against the deleterious effect of UV radiation. In this case the compositions according to the invention are cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a topically applicable, cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and diluent as carrier. According to another embodiment of the invention the compounds of formula (I) can be incorporated into a plastic substrate. The compounds of formula (I) may also be used to stabilize photosensitive ingredients in topical formulations particularly colorants, such as FD&amp;C and D&amp;C colorants, curcumin, riboflavin, lactoflavine, tartrazine, chinolinyellow, cochenille, azorubin, amaranth, ponceau 4R, erythrosin, indigotin, chlorophylle, chlorophyllin, caramel, Carbo medicinalis, carotinoids, bixin, norbixin, annato, orlean, capsanthin, capsorubin, lycopin, xanthophylle, flavoxanthin, lutein, kryptoaxanthin, rubixanthin, violaxanthin, rhodoxanthin, canthaxanthin, betanin, anthocyans, vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K1, vitamin C or other active ingredients.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) have adsorption maxima in the UV-A region. For the preparation of light screening agents, especially of preparations for dermatological and/or cosmetic use, such as skin protection and sunscreen formulations for everyday cosmetics a compound of formula (I) may be incorporated in auxiliary agents, e.g. a cosmetic base, which are conventionally used for such formulations. Where-convenient, other conventional UV-A and/or UV-B screening agents, preferably a pigment, may also be added. The combination of UV filters may show a synergistic effect. The preparation of said light screening agents is well known to the skilled artisan in this field. The concentration of UV filters is varied in a wide range. For example, the amount of compounds of formula I and optionally an additional hydrophilic and/or lipophilic UV-A or UV-B screening agent other than the compounds of formula (I) may be in the range of from 0.5 to 12% by weight of the total composition.

Such compositions can, in particular, be provided in the form of a lotion, a thickened lotion, a gel, a cream, a milk, an ointment, a powder or a solid tube stick and can be optionally be packaged as an aerosol and can be provided in the form of a mousse, foam or a spray. When the cosmetic composition according to the invention are provided for protecting the human epidermis against UV radiation or as sunscreen composition, they can be in the form of a suspension or dispersion in solvents or fatty substances, or alternatively in the form of an emulsion or microemulsion (in particular of O/W or W/O type, O/W/O or W/O/W-type), such as a cream or a milk, a vesicular dispersion, in the form of an ointment, a gel, a solid tube stick or an aerosol mousse. The emulsions can also contain anionic, nonionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactants.<br>
The compounds of the present invention protect the skin and hair against dangerous UV-A radiation. They can be complemented by other UV-A sunscreens in the organic phase thus giving rise to higher sun protection. The compounds can easily be incorporated into different cosmetic compositions, and they show protection against a longer wavelength than other<br><br>
known UV-A sunscreens and in particular than other commercial, water-soluble UV-A sunscreens, thus being a real UV-A filter and not an UV-A/UV-B gap filter and shielding the skin up to the visible rays without being colored. Furthermore, it is a significant advantage of the novel compounds of formula (I) that they show higher extinctions than other known water-soluble UV-A sunscreens and in particular even a better extinction than the present commercial water-soluble UV-A sunscreens, thus giving better protection. The compounds of formula (I) additionally show an excellent photostability. Surprisingly the compounds of formula (I) also stabilize emulsions and can therefore serve as co-emulsifiers for the compositions of the present invention, if these are in the form of an emulsion. The compounds of formula (I) show a very low skin penetration and have excellent adhesiveness to skin and hair.<br>
The following examples are provided to further illustrate the processes and compositions of the present invention. These examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
