				<td>The invention concerns a pivotal connecting device between two<br>
components of a supporting structure strastic gerland or catenary support roller sets of that kind, which accordingly involve a chain formed from the rollers, are suspended on a support frame structure. Particularly in the case of heavy belt conveyor installations as are used for example in brown coal or lignite open-cast mines, garland or catenary support roller sets are preferred in comparison with the support roller sets which are arranged rigidly in frame structures, because, besides the markedly simpler design construction of the belt support structure, they enjoy the advantage of a garland geometry which freely sets itself under the weight of the belt, and that fact results in a more uniform support characteristic on the part of the rollers. In addition garland support roller sets can be lowered in ongoing operation in order thereby to move a defective support roller out of engagement with the belt supported by that roller.<br>
Making the connections between garland support roller sets and the support structure and between two adjacent support rollers of the garland support roller set involves a comparatively large amount of work, when using known connecting elements. Also when using the known connecting elements, it is not readily possible to arrange the support rollers of a garland support roller set in such a way that at least one support roller which is generally the central support roller is arranged displaced parallel to the direction of travel of the belt conveyor run supported thereby, at a spacing relative to the vertical plane which is defined by the lateral support rollers, and in that situation to design the connection between the central support roller and each of the support rollers disposed laterally therebeside, such that the connection is torsionally stiff in relation to moments which act about the longitudinal axis of the central support roller.<br><br>
That displaced arrangement of the at least one central support roller relative to the lateral support rollers takes account of the fact that, as a result of the resistances to motion acting thereon - and, when the belt axis is inclined, also as a result of the force of gravity - the garland support roller set is pivoted so far out of the geometrically optimum position in which the support roller axis is oriented perpendicularly to the direction of travel of the belt, until the forces acting on the support roller set - the force due to the weight of the support roller set, the applied load consisting of the belt and the loading thereon and the resistance to motion - again produce a moment equilibrium about the suspension points of the gar1and configuration. The rotational movement takes place about the axis which is defined by the two suspension points of the garland configuration. In the position of being pivoted with respect to the geometrically optimum position, the lateral support rollers form in relation to the direction of travel of the belt a camber angle which results in an increased resistance to motion and thus an increased power demand. The arrangement of the at least one central support roller at a spacing from the plane defined by the lateral rollers means that the centre of gravity of the garland configuration is displaced in the direction in which the central support roller is arranged in displaced relationship with respect to that plane. The consequence of this is that, in its initial position in which no resistances to motion act on the garland configuration, that is to say when the belt conveyor is stationary, the garland configuration involves a camber angle which is governed by its structure, that is to say the lateral rollers are inclined relative to the direction of travel of the belt. Under the applied load consisting of the conveyor belt and the loading thereon and under the action of the resistances to motion acting on the garland support roller set, the above-mentioned camber angle which is governed by the structure involved is compensated in dependence on<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
loading on the belt conveyor, while with a suitable choice in respect of the length of the spacing by which the central support roller is arranged in displaced relationship, the dynamic camber angle, that is to say the camber angle which is caused by the moving belt, can correspond to the structural camber angle and thus, as the two camber angles are in opposite relationship to each other, the resulting camber angle becomes zero. By virtue of the changing and also fluctuating loading on the belt however that is frequently only an ideal condition that is to be sought after.<br>
The object of the present invention is that of so designing the connecting elements which are used for connecting two components of a support structure for a belt conveyor, which is provided with garland support roller sets, that the connecting elements are simple to produce and easy to handle and if necessary can be so designed, without a significant increase in cost, that the at least one central support roller is arranged in displaced relationship with respect to the lateral support rollers, in the above-described manner. In this respect the invention seeks to provide that in this case also the amount of work required for making the connection remains small.<br><br>
Thus each connection requires two connecting elements which can be designed in the same manner and have two limbs which extend substantially at a right angle relative to each other and of which the first limb provides for the connection between said element and the first of the two components which are to be connected together and the second limb is in engagement with the first limb of the respective other connecting element which at the same time is also in engagement with the second component. The consequence of that interconnection of the two connecting elements is that it is torsionally stiff in relation to<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
moments which are operative about the longitudinal axis of the central support roller. On the other hand a pivotal movement of the support rollers about an axis which is perpendicular to the respective support roller axis is possible so that the support rollers of each support roller garland can adopt the respective optimum angular position, under the applied load of the conveyor belt.<br>
The two co-operating connecting elements, each of which is associated with a respective one of the two components to be connected together, can be secured by way of a screw nut which desirably can be screwed on to the limb of at least one of the two connecting elements, which extends substantially perpendicularly to the associated support roller axis. For that purpose it is advantageous for that limb to be provided with a male screwthread at its free end which projects out of the second limb of the respective other connecting element. In general it will be sufficient for such a holding nut to be mounted on one of the two connecting elements. It will be appreciated that it is also possible for such a holding nut to be provided on the first limb of each of the two connecting elements.<br>
The connection between the axle or shaft of the respective support roller and the connecting element cooperating therewith can be made in a simple fashion by the shaft being provided with a substantially radial bore, through which the first limb of the connecting element can be fitted, thereby providing a push-in connection which at the same time also provides the connection to the respective other connecting element which for that purpose is provided with a suitably sized and positioned opening therethrough.<br>
In that case, the length of the first limbs of both connecting elements essentially depends on whether the two support rollers which are connected together by the connecting unit are arranged in mutually displaced relationship or not, and possibly on the extent of such displacement. However the fundamental configuration of the<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
connecting elements and also the parts co-operating therewith is independent of the relative arrangement of the support rollers.<br>
Two embodiments of the invention are diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of a support roller station of a belt conveyor,<br>
Figure 2 is a view of a portion from a garland support roller set partly in section approximately in the direction of the arrows II-II in Figure 1, and<br>
Figure 3 is a view of ,the non-displaced connection between the support frame structure and the garland support roller set approximately in the direction of the arrow III in Figure 1.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the support roller station illustrated therein is provided in the usual manner with two support roller sets 10, 12 which are each in the form of a garland or catenary assembly or roller chain and of which the upper support roller set 10 is associated with the upper run 14 of a belt conveyor while the lower support roller set 12 is associated with the lower run 16 of the belt conveyor. The two support roller sets 10 and 12 are suspended from a support frame structure 18. Each support roller set comprises a central support roller 20 and two lateral support rollers 22. The support roller sets are carried by the support frame structure by way of holders 24 which are mounted to the support frame structure and which are each respectively connected to the lateral support rollers 22. In the embodiment illustrated in the drawing the two support roller sets 10, 12 involve different geometries in such a way that the upper run 14 which is supported by the support roller set 10 and which is generally the conveying run involves a more greatly accentuated trough configuration than the lower run 16.<br>
The different lengths of the rollers and the different number thereof in the support roller sets arise out of the technical demands in respect thereof and the<br>
-5-<br><br>
trough configuration required for the respectively associated conveyor belt run. The applicability of the invention is not affected thereby.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the connection between a central support roller 20 and one of the lateral support rollers 22. The arrangement in this case is such that the central support roller 20 is arranged in displaced relationship relative to the lateral support rollers 22 by the spacing 26 in such a way that, in the direction 28 of belt travel, the central support roller 20 is disposed downstream of the vertical plane 30 which is defined by the longitudinal axes of the lateral support rollers 22 when the garland support roller set is at rest.<br>
The connecting unit 34 for making the connection between the two support rollers 20 and 22 has two connecting elements 36, 38 which are both of the same configuration. The connecting element 36 is associated with the central support roller 20 while the connecting element 38 is associated with the outer support roller 22. The two connecting elements 36, 38 are of an angular configuration in such a way that first limbs 36a and 38a respectively and second limbs 36b and 38b respectively each extend in substantially perpendicular relationship to each other, that is to say, they include a right angle. The connection between the respective connecting element 36 and 38 and the associated support roller 20 and 22 respectively is made by way of a radial bore 44, 46 which is provided in the end region of the respective support axle or shaft 40 and 42 respectively and in which there can be inserted a pin-shaped portion 48 and 50, of round cross-section, of the respective first limb 36a and 38a respectively. In that respect, the outside diameter of the pin-shaped portion 48 and 50 is matched to the inside diameter of the respective bore 44 and 46 in such a fashion that the support shaft 40 and 42 respectively is pivotable without a great deal of play about the respective pin-shaped portion 48, 50.<br>
The second limb 36b and 38b respectively of each<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
connecting element 36 and 38 is provided with a hole 52 and 54, the mside diameter of which corresponds to the outside diameter of the respective pin portions 48 and 50. The two connecting elements 36, 38 are of such a configuration and size that, in the position producing the connection between the two support rollers 20, 22, the respective second limb 36b, 38b is positioned laterally beside the support shaft 42 and 40 respectively of the respective other roller 22, 20, in such a way that the hole 52 and 54 is aligned with the bore 46 and 44 in the respective support shaft 42, 40, and thus the pin-shaped portion 48, 50 of the respective other connecting element 36 and 38 respectively also projects through the hole 54 and 52 in the limb 38b and 36b respectively. The connecting arrangement according to the invention excludes pivotal movements about the longitudinal axis of one of the two support rollers.<br>
Thus the connection between the two support rollers 20, 22 is produced by a respective connecting element 36, 38 being connected to the shaft of one of the two support rollers, with both connecting elements being in double engagement with each other at the same time. The two connecting elements are arrested by a screw nut 56 which, in the case of the embodiment as shown in Figure 2, is screwed on to the end region 58, which has a male screwthread thereon, of the pin-shaped portion 48 of the first connecting element 36. The nut 36 can be secured to prevent it from accidentally coming loose, by using suitable means. When tightening the nut in order to secure the two connecting elements 36, 38, it is only necessary to ensure that the assembly does not involve any bracing effect with respect to the two support shafts 40, 42, so that pivotability thereof and thus pivotability of the support rollers 20, 22 with respect to the connecting unit 34 is guaranteed in any situation. It will be appreciated that it is also possible, in place of the screw nut, to use other securing means, for example a cotter pin or the like, which can possibly also additionally be used.<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
As a departure from the view shown xn Fxgure 2, a screw nut can also be mounted on the end region of each of the two pin-shaped portions 40, 50, although this is generally not necessary. Furthermore, as a departure from the view shown in Figure 2, when using only one screw nut, the pin-shaped portion of the other connecting element, in the illustrated case the portion 50, can also be provided with a male screwthread in order to render the connecting elements 36, 38 uniform and thus to simplify the manufacture thereof.<br>
The procedure for assembly of the two connecting elements 36, 38 is also extremely simple, especially as the collars or shoulders 70 provided on the respective first limb 36a, 38a form an abutment so that, when the pin-shaped portions 48 and 50 are inserted into the bore in the respective component, the two connecting elements 36, 38 are set in the correct position relative to the two components which are to be connected together, and thus also relative to each other, without involving additional measures.<br>
Figure 3 shows details of the mode of mounting the garland support roller set on the support frame structure 18 using the connecting arrangement 34 according to the invention. The support shaft 42 of the lateral support roller 22 is also provided with its end that is towards the support frame structure 18 with a substantially radial bore 44 into which the pm-shaped portion 48 of the first limb 36a of the first connecting element 36 can be inserted in the manner already described above. The pin-shaped portion 50 of the second connecting element 38 passes through a bore 62 in the holder 24, the bore 62 being substantially parallel to the bore 44. The holder 24 is carried by the support frame structure 18. In other words, the holder 24 which is possibly also in the form of a shaft or axle portion performs the function of the support shaft of the respective; second support roller, that is to say for example the support roller indicated at 42 in Figure 2. In<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
other respects, the arrangement is of a similar nature so that in that connection attention can be directed to the description relating to Figure 2. The only difference in relation to the structure shown in Figure 2 is that the first limb 36a and 38a respectively of each of the two connecting elements 36, 38 is shorter so that the support roller shaft 42 and the holder 24 are arranged in a common plane which, when the belt conveyor is stationary, will extend generally perpendicularly. It will be appreciated that, when connecting two support rollers together, it is also possible to involve a connection in which the support rollers are not displaced relative to each other.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the holder 24 is carried by a fork portion 64 and is secured thereto for example by means of a weld. The fork portion 64 is in engagement with an adjusting member 66 which is mounted pivotably on the actual support frame structure 18. The adjusting member 66 is pivotable about a pin or bolt 68 mounted on the support frame stiructure 18. That known adjusting member which is not directly related to the present invention affords the possibility, by virtue of a pivotal movement and a resulting additional longitudinal movement of the adjusting member, of somewhat lowering the garland support roller set and thus moving it out of engagement with the conveyor belt.<br>
