				<td>ACCESSING DATA STORAGE DEVICES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. Technical Field<br>
This application relates to the field of computer storage devices, and more<br>
particularly to the field of selectively providing access to computer storage devices.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Host processor systems may store and retrieve data using a storage device<br>
containing a plurality of host interface units (host adapters), disk drives, and disk<br>
interface units (disk adapters). Such storage devices are provided, for example, by<br>
EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass, and disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,206,939 to<br>
Yanai et al., 5,778,394 to Galtzur et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,845,147 to Vishlitzky et al.,<br>
and U.S. Patent No. 5,857,208 to Ofek. The host systems access the storage device<br>
through a plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and<br>
access control information through the channels of the storage device and the storage<br>
device provides data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems<br>
do not address the disk drives of the storage device directly, but rather, access what<br>
appears to the host systems as a plurality of logical volumes. The logical volumes<br>
may or may not correspond to the actual disk drives.<br>
In some cases, it may be necessary to provide access to a computer storage<br>
device for maintenance and/or reconfiguration of the computer storage device.<br>
However, since the type of access needed to be able to perform maintenance and/or<br>
reconfiguration is the same type of access that would allow a malicious user to<br>
damage the computer storage device and/or eliminate or corrupt data, stored thereon, it<br>
is useful to be able to restrict the particular users that have the type of access needed<br>
to perform maintenance and/or reconfiguration of the computer storage device. One<br>
way to do this is to password protect the computer storage device and provide the<br>
password only to those users that are allowed to perform maintenance and/or<br>
reconfiguration on the computer storage device. However, at some point, it may<br>
become desirable to revoke access for at least some of the users that were previously<br>
given access. For example, a user that works for a company that maintains the<br><br>
storage device may leave that company. In addition, authorized users may<br>
inadvertently (or otherwise) divulge a password to a malicious user who may then use<br>
the password to gain access and damage the storage device and/or destroy or corrupt<br>
the data.<br>
One way to address this difficulty is to connect (e.g., via a communications<br>
cable, the Internet, etc.) each of the storage devices to a central security device that<br>
manages security/access for all of the storage devices and that reconfigures and<br>
revokes users' passwords that allow access to the storage devices. In instances where<br>
it is desirable to revoke a user's access or in instances where an authorized user has<br>
divulged a password, the central security device, coupled to the storage device, may<br>
change/revoke the effected password and then notify authorized users of the change.<br>
However, such a central security device may be impractical for a number of reasons,<br>
not the least of which is the fact that it may be difficult to connect all storage devices<br>
to the central security device.<br>
It is desirable to address the security issues that arise when passwords for<br>
accessing security devices need to be changed/revoked without having to provide<br>
remote connections to the storage devices.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, restricting access to a device includes<br>
obtaining a passphrase for a user, obtaining access credentials for the user, obtaining a<br>
PIN value for the user, one-way encrypting at least the access credentials and the PIN<br>
using a secret key provided with the device, allowing access to the device if the result<br>
of one-way encrypting equals the passphrase, and denying access to the device if the<br>
result of one-way encrypting does not equal the passphrase. The device may be a<br>
storage device. The access credentials may include a username that identifies the user<br>
and a role for the user. The access credentials may include a time period for which<br>
access is allowed. Restricting access to a device may also include, after allowing<br>
access, subsequently revoking access in response to the current date and time being<br>
greater than the time period for which access is allowed. Restricting access to a<br>
device may also include obtaining time/date data indicative of a current date and time<br>
and one-way encrypting the time/date data along with the access credentials and the<br><br>
PIN using the secret key. Restricting access to a device may also include, after<br>
allowing access, subsequently revoking access in response to the current date and<br>
time being greater than the time period for which access is allowed. Obtaining the<br>
passphrase may include the user presenting at least one of: a smartcard, a memory<br>
stick, a floppy disk, and a CD or may include the user typing in the passphrase.<br>
Restricting access to a device may also include obtaining a. device. ID indicative of the<br>
device being accessed and one-way encrypting the device ID along with the access<br>
credentials and the PIN using the secret key. The secret key may be provided at the<br>
device in tamper-proof hardware.<br>
According further to the present invention, constructing a passphrase for a user<br>
to gain access to a device includes obtaining a username that identifies the user,<br>
obtaining a PIN for the user, obtaining an expected time of access for the device,<br>
obtaining an identifier that identifies the device, and one-way encrypting the<br>
username, the PIN, the expected time of access, and the identifier using a secret key to<br>
provide the passphrase. The device may be a storage device. Constructing a<br>
passphrase for a user to gain access to a device may include storing the passphrase in<br>
a computer-readable medium. The computer readable medium may be one of: a<br>
smartcard, a memory stick, a floppy disk, and a CD. A computer reetdable medium<br>
having computer executable instructions may be provided for performing the steps<br>
described herein.<br>
According further to the present invention, a computer storage device includes<br>
a plurality of disk drives, a plurality of disk adapters coupled to the disk drives, a<br>
memory coupled to the plurality of disk adapters, a plurality of host adapters, coupled<br>
to the disk adapters and the memory, that communicate with host computers to send<br>
and receive data to and from the disk drives and a. service processor director, coupled<br>
to the memory, that restricts access to the storage device by obtaining a passphrase for<br>
a user, obtaining access credentials for the user, obtaining a PIN value for the user,<br>
one-way encrypting at least the access credentials and the PIN using a secret key<br>
provided with the storage device, allowing access to the storage device if the result of<br>
one-way encrypting equals the passphrase, and denying access to the storage device if<br>
the result of one-way encrypting does not equal the passphrase. The access<br><br>
credentials may include a username that identifies the user and a role for the user<br>
and/or may include a time period for which access is allowed.<br>
According further to the present invention, a computer readable medium has<br>
computer executable instructions for performing any of the steps described herein.<br>
According further to the present invention, a system has at least one processor<br>
that performs any of the steps described herein.<br>

Detailed Description of Various Embodiments<br>
Referring to figure 1, a diagram 20 shows a plurality of hosts 22a-22c coupled<br>
to a data storage device 24. The data storage device 24 includes an internal memory<br>
26 that facilitates operation of the storage device 24 as described elsewhere herein.<br>
The data storage device also includes a plurality of host adaptors (HA's) 28a-28c that<br>
handle reading and writing of data between the hosts 22a-22c and the storage device<br>
24. Although the diagram 20 shows each of the hosts 22a-22c coupled to each of the<br>
HA's 28a-28c, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that one or<br>
more of the HA's 28a-28c may be coupled to other hosts.<br>
The storage device 24 may include one or more RDF adapter units (RA's) 32a-<br>
32c. The RA's 32a-32c are coupled to an RDF link 34 and are similar to the HA's<br>
28a-28c, but are used to transfer data between the storage device 24 and other storage<br>
devices (not shown) that are also coupled to the RDF link 34. The storage device 24<br>
may be coupled to addition RDF links (not shown) in addition to the RDF link 34.<br>
The storage device 24 may also include one or more disks 36a-36c, each<br>
containing a different portion of data stored on the storage device 24. Each of the<br>
disks 36a-36c may be coupled to a corresponding one of a plurality of disk adapter<br>
units (DA) 38a-38c that provides data to a corresponding one of the disks 36a-36c and<br>
receives data from a corresponding one of the disks 36a-36c. Note that, in some<br>
embodiments, it is possible for more than one disk to be serviced by a DA and that it<br>
is possible for more than one DA to service a disk.<br>
The logical storage space in the storage device 24 that corresponds to the disks<br>
36a-36c may be subdivided into a plurality of volumes or logical devices. The logical<br>
devices may or may not correspond to the physical storage space of the disks 36a-36c.<br>
Thus, for example, the disk 36a may contain a plurality of logical devices or,<br>
alternatively, a single logical device could span both of the disks 36a, 36b. The hosts<br>
22a-22c may be configured to access any combination of logical devices independent<br>
of the location of the logical devices on the disks 36a-36c.<br>
One or more internal logical data path(s) exist between the DA's 38a-38c, the<br>
HA's 28a-28c, the RA's 32a-32c, and the memory 26. In some embodiments, one or<br><br><br>
more internal busses and/or communication modules may be used. In some<br>
embodiments, the memory 26 may be used to facilitate data transferred between the<br>
DA's 38a-38c, the HA's 28a-28c and the RA's 32a-32c. The memory 26 may contain<br>
tasks that are to be performed by one or more of the DA's 38a-38c, the HA's 28a-28c<br>
 and the RA's 32a-32c, and a cache for data fetched from one or more of the disks 36a-<br>
36c. Use of the memory 26 is described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
The storage device 24 may also include a service processor director 42 that<br>
communicates with and controls components of the storage device 24 to modify the<br>
configuration thereof. For example, the service processor director 42 may be used to<br>
 configure local and remote data mirroring, may provide access to various system<br>
functions such as disk erasing, and, generally, may provide relatively thorough and<br>
complete access to the storage device 24 and components thereof to facilitate<br>
maintenance, configuration, etc.<br>
The service processor director 42 may be provided with a modem connection<br>
 that allows remote access to the storage device 24 through the service processor<br>
director 42. Using the modem connection, it may be possible for a remote technician<br>
to perform maintenance, reconfiguration, etc. to the storage device 24. In an<br>
embodiment herein, the modem connection into the service processor 42 is restricted<br>
to the manufacture of the storage device 24. Of course, other access rules are possible<br>
 so that, for example, it is possible to provide access through the modem connection to<br>
a plurality of trusted users.<br>
The service processor director 42 may be coupled to a service processor 44<br>
that interfaces with the service processor director 42 to provide access to allow,<br>
maintenance, reconfiguration, etc. of the storage device 24. In an embodiment herein,<br>
 the service processor 44 may be implemented using a conventional laptop computer<br>
running the Windows® operating system. The service processor 44 may be coupled<br>
to the service processor director 42 in any appropriate fashion, such as by<br>
conventional data communication means. In some embodiments, a secure, tamper-<br>
proof, connection may be used between service processor 44 and the service<br>
 processor director 42. The service processor 44 may be built into the storage device<br>
24 so that access to the service processor 44 may require access to the storage device<br><br><br>
24 (e.g., via a locked cabinet). In some embodiments, the modem connection may be<br>
provided through the service processor 44 rather than through the service processor<br>
director 42.<br>
The storage device 24 may be provided as a stand-alone device coupled to the<br>
 hosts 22a-22c as shown in figure 1 or, alternatively, the storage device 24 may be part<br>
of a storage area network (SAN) that includes a plurality of other storage devices as<br>
well as routers, network connections, etc. The storage device may be coupled to a<br>
SAN fabric and/or be part of a SAN fabric. The system described herein may be<br>
implemented using software, hardware, and/or a combination of software and<br>
 hardware where software may be stored in an appropriate storage medium and<br>
executed by one or more processors.<br>
Referring to figure 2, a storage device 24 is shown having a plurality of<br>
directors 52a-52c coupled to the memory 26. Each of the directors 52a-52c represents<br>
one of the HA's 28a-28c, RA's 323-320, DA's 38a-38c, or the service processor<br>
 director 42. In an embodiment disclosed herein, there may be up to sixty-four<br>
directors coupled to the memory 26. Of course, for other embodiments, there may be<br>
a higher or lower maximum number of directors that may be used.<br>
The storage device 24 includes an optional communication module (CM) 54<br>
that provides an alternative communication path between the directors 52a-52c. Each<br>
 of the directors 52a-52c may be coupled to the CM 54 so that any one of the directors<br>
52a-52c may send a message and/or data to any other one of the directors 52a-52c<br>
without needing to go through the memory 26. The CM 54 may be implemented<br>
using conventional MUX/router technology where a sending one of the directors 52a-<br>
52c provides an appropriate address to cause a message and/or data to be received by<br>
 an intended receiving one of the directors 52a-52c. Some or all of the functionality of<br>
the CM 54 may be implemented using one or more of the directors 52a-52c so that,<br>
for example, the directors 52a-52c may be interconnected directly with the<br>
interconnection functionality being provided on each of the directors 52a-52c. In<br>
addition, a sending one of the directors 52a-52c may be able to broadcast a message to<br>
 all of the other directors 52a-52c at the same time.<br><br><br>
Referring to Figure 3, the service processor director 42 is shown in more detail<br>
as including a security module 62. Of course, the service processor director 42 may<br>
contain other components besides the security module 62 that provide functionality<br>
other than security. However, the focus of the discussion herein is the security<br>
 module 62 and thus other components of the service processor director 42 are not<br>
shown. The security module 62 restricts access to the storage device 24 for<br>
connections coming through the modem connection and/or the connection for the<br>
service processor 44. Therefore, all maintenance, reconfiguration, etc. commands as<br>
well as system inquiries that are made through either the modem connection or the<br>
 service processor connection to the service processor director 42 pass through and are<br>
vetted by the security module 62.<br>
In an embodiment herein, the security module 62 may be implemented using a<br>
processor and appropriate software. However, it will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the functionality described elsewhere herein for the<br>
 security module 62 may be implemented using any appropriate combination of<br>
computer software and/or hardware. Note also that the security module 62 does not<br>
necessarily need to be implemented within the service processor director 42 and may,<br>
instead, be implemented at any appropriate access point for the storage device 24,<br>
such as the service process 44. Of course, if the security module 62 is implemented at<br>
 a user access point that is not also an access point for the modem connection, then<br>
separate security provisions may need to be made for the modem connection or,<br>
alternatively, the modem connection may be made through'the service processor 44.<br>
Note also that the security module 62 may be implemented using or in conjunction<br>
with an operating system security system, such as built in security features of the<br>
 Windows® operating system. In some embodiments, a username mat is encoded into<br>
a passphase (discussed elsewhere herein) is the same username that the user uses to<br>
log in to the computer operating system.<br>
Note that a user may also be provided with a particular role that controls the<br>
type and extent of access to'the storage device 24 provided to the user. In some<br>
 instances, it may be desirable to provide a user with limited access while in others a<br>
user may need to be given extensive access in order to be able to perform the task(s)<br>
for which the user was given access. The role may be encoded into the passphrase so<br><br><br>
that, when the user presents the passphrase, the role for that user in connection with<br>
accessing the storage device is also defined. Thus, it should be understood that<br>
reference herein to username also may also include, where appropriate, an optional<br>
role for the user.<br>
 Referring to figure 4, a flow chart 80 illustrates steps performed by the<br>
security module 62 in connection with granting and revoking access to the storage<br>
device 24. Processing begins at a first step 82 where a user is prompted for access<br>
credentials. In an embodiment herein, the access credentials include a user passphrase<br>
and a username that identifies the user. The passphrase and/or username may be<br>
 entered manually by the user (e.g., typed by the user at the service processor 44) or<br>
provided to the security module 62 by some other means, such as a floppy disk, a CD,<br>
a smart card, a memory stick, etc. The username allows the security module 62 to<br>
grant access to only the user identified by the username. In an embodiment herein,<br>
the username may be encoded into the passphrase, as discussed in more detail<br>
 elsewhere herein.<br>
Following the step 82 is a step 84 where a user is prompted for a personal<br>
 identification number (PIN). In an embodiment herein, the PIN is also encoded into<br>
the passphrase and is used as a check to protect against the possibility of an<br>
unauthorized user obtaining the passphrase and username and gaining unauthorized<br>
 access to the storage device 24. As discussed elsewhere herein, a user can not gain<br>
access to the storage device 24 without also having the proper PIN value. The PIN<br>
protects against unauthorized access since an unauthorized user who obtains the<br>
username and passphrase may not also obtain the PIN, which may be known only by<br>
the authorized user (and perhaps the entity that issued the passphrase). The<br>
 combination of the passphrase and the PIN may be deemed a two-factored password<br>
since it encompasses both what the user has (the passphrase) and what the user knows<br>
(the PIN).<br>
Following the step 84 is a test stepped 86 where the security module 62<br>
determines if the passphrase, usemame, and PIN entered at the steps 82, 84 are<br>
 acceptable for granting the user identified by the username access to the storage<br>
device 24. The processing performed at the step 86 is discussed in more detail<br><br><br>
elsewhere herein. If it is determined at the test step 86 that the user should not be<br>
granted access, then control transfers from the test step 86 to a test step 88 which<br>
determines if the user should be allowed a retry. In some cases, the system may allow<br>
the user a certain number of retries (e.g. three) to account for the possibility that the<br>
 user incorrectly typed his PIN or somehow other information like the username and/or<br>
the passphrase was entered incorrectly. The number of retries and whether to grant<br>
any retries at all is based on whatever security policy adopted for the system.<br>
If it is determined that the test step 88 that the user is to be allowed a retry,<br>
then control transfers from the test step 88 back to the step 82 to reprompt the user for<br>
 access credentials. Otherwise, if it is determined at the test step 88 that the user is not<br>
to be allowed a retry, then control transfers from the test step 88 to a step 92 where<br>
access error processing is performed. The processing performed at the step 92<br>
depends upon the policies adopted for the system and may include, for example,<br>
displaying a message to the user and requiring that a certain amount of time pass<br>
 before the user can attempt to access the system again. Of course, any other type of<br>
access error processing may be performed at the step 92 consistent with the policy<br>
adopted for the system, if any. Following the step 92, processing is complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 86 that the access credentials and PIN<br>
provided at the steps 82, 84 are acceptable, then control transfers from the test step 86<br>
 to a step 94 where the system enters an access grant state for the user. While the<br>
system is in the access grant state, the user is allowed to access the storage device 24<br>
through the service processor director 42 (or through whatever access point is<br>
provided for the security module 62). In some embodiments, after the system enters<br>
the access state at step 94, the user may be required to separately log in to the system<br>
 and then the log into any application the user wishes to use. In these embodiments,<br>
entering the access state at the step 94 may be a precursor to allowing a user to log<br>
into the system. In other embodiments, entering the access state at the step 94 is part<br>
of the log on process so that the user does not need to separately log in to both the<br>
system and the application after entering the access state at the step 94.<br>
Following the step 94 is a test step 96 which determines if the system has<br>
timed out. In an embodiment herein, the system may time out if a certain amount of<br><br><br><br>
idle time has passed after the user has entered the access state at the step 94.<br>
Providing for a time out prevents a situation where an authorized user accesses the<br>
storage device 24 and subsequently forgets to log out, thus providing an opportunity<br>
for unauthorized users to access storage device 24. In an embodiment herein, the<br>
 system may time out after fifteen minutes have passed with no user keyboard input at<br>
the service processor 44, but of course other timeout values may be used.<br>
In an embodiment herein, another type of timeout may also occur at the step<br>
96. The other type of timeout involves part of the passphrase that may include<br>
information indicating the allowed service time (allowed access time) for the user.<br>
 That is, the passphrase may indicate that the user is only allowed access to the storage<br>
device 24 between a first time and a second time. For example, the user may be<br>
allowed access to the storage device 24 for only a twenty-four or a forty-eight hour<br>
period starting on a particular date. Once this time period has passed, the user may no<br>
longer be allowed access to the storage device 24 even though the user otherwise has<br>
 valid credentials and a valid PIN. Accordingly, for embodiments where the<br>
passphrase includes a time limit for the time which the user is allowed access to the<br>
storage device 24, the test at the step 96 may represent a determination of whether the<br>
time for which the user is allowed access has passed.<br>
In some embodiments, the other type of time out described above is not used<br>
 so that, once the user logs into the system and remains active, the user is not exited<br>
from the access state. Of course, as discussed elsewhere herein, even if the other type<br>
of time out is not used once the user logs in to the system, it is still possible to use<br>
time criteria to determine whether to grant access to the user in the first place.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 96 that a timeout has not occurred, then<br>
 control transfers from the test step 96 to a test step 98 which determines if the user has<br>
logged off of the system. If not, then control transfers back to the test step 96 to<br>
determine if a timeout has occurred. Thus, while a user is accessing the system, the<br>
system is continuously determining if the user has either timed out or if the user has<br>
logged off.<br><br><br><br>
If it is determined at the test step 96 that a timeout has occurred or if it is<br>
determined at the test step 98 that the user has logged off, then control transfers from<br>
either the step 96 or the step 98 to a step 102 where the system exits the access state.<br>
Once the system has exited the access state at the step 102, the user may no longer<br>
 have access to the storage device 24. In some embodiments, the user may be allowed<br>
to reestablish access while in other embodiments the user may not. In embodiments<br>
where the access state is tied to the user logging in to or out of the system, exiting the<br>
access state at the step 102 may represent the user logging out of some part of the<br>
system (e.g., logging out of the operating system). Following the step 102, processing<br>
 is complete.<br>
Referring to figure 5, a diagram 120 illustrates components of the security<br>
module 62 that may be used to perform the test at the step 86 to determine if a user<br>
should be granted access. An access test module 122 receives the passphrase,<br>
username (and possibly user role), and PIN along with other information to generate a<br>
 result indicating whether a particular user corresponding to the username should be<br>
granted access. The access test module 122 also receivers a secret key 124 a storage<br>
device ID 126 and the time and date from a time and date module 128.<br>
The secret key 124 may be stored within the storage device 24 in a way that<br>
does not allow access to the secret key 124 except by the service processor director 42<br>
 (or whichever device is hosting the security module 62) and/or other authorized<br>
devices/users. It is not expected that a user presenting a passphrase would have direct<br>
access to the secret key. In an embodiment herein, the secret key 124 may be stored<br>
using tamper-proof hardware located within the storage device 24. In some<br>
embodiments, each of the different storage devices provided by a manufacturer may<br>
 have a unique secret key. In other embodiments, all of the storage devices from a<br>
manufacture may have the same secret key. In still other embodiments, groups of<br>
storage devices have the same secret key while other storage devices have a different<br>
secret key. The distribution of secret keys is a security policy decision. The more<br>
storage devices that share the same secret key, the easier it is to administer the system.<br>
 However, providing different storage devices with different secret keys increases the<br>
level of security provided by the system. As discussed elsewhere herein, the secret<br>
key 124 is also known by an entity that generates the passphrase for the user which, in<br><br><br><br>
an embodiment herein, may be the manufacture of the storage device 24 or some<br>
other entity that manages maintenance/reconfiguration of the storage device 24.<br>
The identifier 126 may be used to uniquely identify the storage device 24 to<br>
prevent a user who is authorized to access only a particular storage device from<br>
 (inadvertently or otherwise) accessing other storage devices. In some embodiments,<br>
each storage device may be provided with a unique identifier. In other embodiments,<br>
groups of storage devices may share an identifier so that, for example, a plurality of<br>
storage devices at a single site may have the same identifier. In an embodiment<br>
herein, the identifier 126 is also the serial number of the storage device 24 issued by<br>
 the manufacturer of the storage device 24.<br>
The time and date module 128 may be used to obtain the current time and date<br>
and provide that information to the access test module 122. In an embodiment herein,<br>
the time and date module 128 accesses one of a plurality of well-known Web sites to<br>
obtain time information. Obviously, the time and date module 128 may obtain time<br>
 information from any source, including an internal clock of the storage device 24.<br>
However, to the extent that the accuracy of the information from the time and date<br>
module 128 can be ensured, the system is more secure since ensuring the time and<br>
date information prevents an unauthorized user from modifying the system time and<br>
date information for the storage device 24 in an attempt to use an "old" passphrase.<br>
 There are a number of well-known mechanisms that may be employed to help ensure<br>
that the time and information from the time and date module 124 are accurate.<br>
Referring to figure 6, a flowchart 140 illustrates steps performed by the access<br>
test module 122 in order to determine whether to grant access to a user. Processing<br>
begins a first step 142 where the access test module 122 obtains the secret key<br>
 associated with the storage device 24. As discussed elsewhere herein, the secret key<br>
associated with the storage device 24 may be stored in tamper-proof hardware<br>
provided within the storage device 24. Following the step 142 is a step 144 where the<br>
access test module 122 obtains the ID of the storage device 24. Following the step<br>
144 is a step 146 where the access test module 122 obtains the current date and time<br>
 from the date and time module 128. As discussed elsewhere herein, improving the<br>
reliability of the date and time improves the security of the system.<br><br><br><br>
Following the step 146 is a step 148 where the access test module 122 obtains<br>
the passphrase, username (and possibly role), and PIN. In an embodiment herein, the<br>
user may present a storage medium such as a smart card or memory that contains the<br>
passphrase and (possibly the role) and may manually type in the username in PIN into<br>
 the service processor 44 or other appropriate device. In other embodiments, the user<br>
may manually type in the passphrase and/or the username instead of, or in addition to,<br>
providing that information using a storage medium. In other embodiments, the user<br>
may type in only the PIN.<br>
Following the step 148 is a step 152 where a one-way encryption is performed<br>
 using the secret key, the ID, the date and time, the username (and possibly role), and<br>
the PIN. In an embodiment herein, the one-way encryption performed at the step 152<br>
is a one-way mathematical function that generates a deterministic output value from a<br>
particular set of input values such that it is mathematically difficult, if not impossible,<br>
to ascertain the input values given only the output value. Thus, an unauthorized user<br>
 who obtains a passphrase may not use it to ascertain the secret key or any other<br>
information encoded into the passphrase.<br>
There are a significant number of types of one-way encryption functions that<br>
may be used, including encryption of the ID, the date and time, the username (and<br>
possibly role), and the PIN using the secret key, encryption of the ID, the date and<br>
 time, the username (and possibly role), the PIN and the secret key, certain types of<br>
one-way hash functions, digital signatures, etc. The system described herein does not<br>
depend upon any specific type of one-way encryption function being used, so long as<br>
it the one-way encryption 1) allows verification that the entity that constructed the<br>
passphase is in possession of the secret key and 2) the secret key can not be<br>
 ascertained (or at least practically ascertained) from the passphrase. Note that, for the<br>
system provided herein, the user is not given the secret key except as it is encrypted in<br>
or used to encrypt the passphrase.<br>
Following the step 152 is a test step 154 which determines if the result of the<br>
one-way encryption performed at the step 152 equals the passphrase. If not, then<br>
 control transfers to the step 156 where the access test module returns an indicator<br>
indicating that no access is to be provided to the user. Following step 156, processing<br><br><br><br>
is complete. On the other hand, if it is determined at the test step 154 that the result of<br>
the hash performed at the step 152 equals the passphrase, then control transfers from<br>
the test step 154 to a step 158 where the access test module 122 returns an indicator<br>
indicating that the user corresponding to the username provided at the step 148 is<br>
 allowed access to the storage device 24. If a role is used, then the indicator provided<br>
at the step 148 also indicates the role for the user. Following the step 158, processing<br>
is complete.<br>
In an embodiment herein, the system may round the time and date value<br>
obtained at the step 146 to the nearest day. Similarly, the passphrase may be encoded<br>
 with a time and date value rounded to the nearest day. In this way, it is possible to<br>
have the time value obtained at the step 146 be equal to the time value encoded into<br>
the passphrase. Of course, different rounding may be used so that, for example, time<br>
values may be rounded to the nearest week, the nearest two-day period, etc. In<br>
addition, it is possible to encode the passphrase with the expected time of service<br>
 (rather than the current time) so that, when the user presents the passphrase to the<br>
storage device 24, the time encoded in the passphrase can match the time of service.<br>
Note also that the time obtained at the step 146 may be used in connection with the<br>
test for a timeout at the step 96 discussed above in connection with the flowchart 80<br>
of figure 4 to determine if the allowed time of access has passed. Following the step<br>
 158, processing is complete.<br>
Referring to figure 7, a flowchart 170 illustrates steps performed in connection<br>
with generating a passphrase for a user to access the storage device 24. In an<br>
embodiment herein, the passphrase may be generated by the manufacture of the<br>
storage device 24 and provided to users on an as needed basis. It is also possible to<br>
 have an entity other than the manufacture be responsible for<br>
maintenance/reconfiguration of the storage device. 24 and thus be responsible for<br>
generating passphrases. In embodiments where the time value is included in the<br>
passphrase, then users are given a passphrase that has encoded therein an allowed<br>
time for the users to access to the storage device 24.<br>
 Processing begins at a first step 172 where the username is entered. Entering<br>
the username at the step 172 may be performed by any appropriate means, including<br>
15<br><br><br>
having the user type and his or her username or by accessing a database of authorized<br>
users that contains the username. If roles are employed, then the role for the user may<br>
also be entered at the step 172. Following the step 172 is a step 174 when the<br>
expected access time of the storage device 24 is entered. As discussed elsewhere<br>
 herein, the expected access time may be encoded into the passphrase so that the<br>
passphrase allows access to the storage device 24 only for the specified time rather<br>
than at any time. Following the step 174 is a step 176 where the ID of the storage<br>
device 24 is entered. Following the step 176 is a step 178 where the secret key is<br>
entered. In an embodiment herein, the entity that generates the passphrase (for<br>
 example, the manufacturer of the storage device 24) maintains the same secret key<br>
that is provided at the storage device 24. Just as with the secret key at the storage<br>
device 24, the secret key at the location where the passphrase is generated may be<br>
protected from unauthorized access/modification in some form using, for example,<br>
tamper-proof hardware, a vaulted computer, etc.<br>
Following step 178 is a step 182 when the PIN is entered. In an embodiment<br>
herein, a user desiring access may choose his or her own PIN for each time the user<br>
accesses a storage device. In other embodiments, is possible to assign PIN values in<br>
an automatic fashion and then to report to the user the assigned PIN value. Following<br>
the step 182 is a step 184 where a passphrase is generated. Generating the passphrase<br>
 at step 184 involves using the same (or similar) one-way encryption function used to<br>
test for the validity of the passphrase by the access test module 122. For example, in<br>
embodiments where a one-way hash function is used to test for the passphrase by the<br>
access test module 122, then the same one-way hash function may be used to generate<br>
the passphrase at step 184.<br>
Note that it is possible to use a different function to generate the passphrase<br>
than is used to test the passphrase at the access test module. Note that it is also<br>
possible to use different keys for generation and testing. For example, using a<br>
public/private key pair, it is possible to generate the passphrase using a private key<br>
(by digitally signing the data of the passphrase, except the key, using the private key)<br>
 and then verify the passphase at the storage device using the corresponding public<br>
key. An advantage to this is that it does not require special storage requirements for<br><br><br><br>
the secret key at the storage device 24 since the storage device 24 may use a non-<br>
secret public key to verify the digital signature.<br>
Following the step 184 is an optional step 186 where the passphrase is stored<br>
in a computer readable storage medium, such as a smart card, a floppy disk, a CD, a<br>
 memory stick, or any other appropriate computer readable storage medium. Of<br>
course, since the passphrase is simply a set of numbers/symbols, it is always possible<br>
to simply report the passphrase to the user and have the user to type in the passphrase<br>
at the storage device 24 when the user is requesting access. However, if the step 186<br>
is executed, then the user may have a copy of the passphrase stored on a computer<br>
 readable storage medium that the user may then present to the storage device 24 when<br>
the user desires access. Note also that it is possible to store the passphrase on a<br>
computer readable storage medium at the step 186 and still require the user type in the<br>
passphrase at the storage device 24. In that case, the computer readable storage<br>
medium may simply be for the purpose of providing a permanent copy of the<br>
 passphrase in case the user loses or forgets it. Following step 186, processing is<br>
complete. Note that, if the step 186 is not executed, then following the step 184<br>
processing is complete.<br>
It is possible to provide other embodiments of the system described herein that<br>
encode only a subset of the information that is illustrated herein as being encoded in<br>
 to the passphrase. For example, it is possible to omit the ED and/or to omit the access<br>
time and/or to omit the usernarne, etc. In addition, it is also possible to add additional<br>
information to be encoded into the passphrase that is not mentioned in connection<br>
with the flowchart 170 in figure 7. Any possible additional information may be added<br>
 to the passphrase. Examples are the types of additional information which may be<br>
 added include location information, information indicating the nature of the service to<br>
be performed by the user, etc.<br>
