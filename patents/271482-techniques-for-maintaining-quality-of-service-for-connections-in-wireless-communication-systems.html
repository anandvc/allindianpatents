TECHNIQUES FOR MAINTAINING QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR<br>
CONNECTIONS IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cross-reference to Related Application<br>
[0000] This application claims priority from provisional application serial no.<br>
61/016,616, attorney docket no. CE17322N4V, entitled "TECHNIQUES FOR<br>
MAINTAINING QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR CONNECTIONS IN WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS," and filed December 26,2007, which is commonly<br>
owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field<br>
[0001] This disclosure relates generally to wireless communication systems and, more<br>
specifically, to techniques for maintaining quality of service for connections in<br>
wireless communication systems.<br>
Related Art<br>
[0002] Today, many wireless communication systems are designed using shared<br>
channels. For example, in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)<br>
802.16 (commonly known as worldwide interoperability for microwave access<br>
(WiMAX)) and third-generation partnership project long-term evolution (3GPP-LTE)<br>
compliant architectures, an uplink (UL) channel is shared and resources may be<br>
periodically allocated to individual service flows (connections) in the case of delay<br>
sensitive (e.g., real-time) applications (e.g., Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)<br>
applications).<br>
[0003] In WiMAX compliant wireless communication systems, a quality of service<br>
(QoS) parameter set is defined for each service flow, which is a unidirectional flow of<br>
packets between a subscriber station (SS) and a serving base station (BS) and vice<br>
versa. Each service flow has an assigned service flow identification (SFID), which<br>
functions as a principal identifier for the service flow between an SS and a serving<br>
BS. In WiMAX compliant wireless communication systems, scheduling services<br><br>
represent the data handling mechanisms supported by a medium access control<br>
(MAC) scheduler for data transport on a connection. Each connection is associated<br>
with a single scheduling service, which is determined by a set of QoS parameters that<br>
are managed using dynamic service addition (DSA) and dynamic service change<br>
(DSC) message dialogs. IEEE 802.16e compliant wireless communication systems<br>
support a number of different data services. For example, IEEE 802.16e compliant<br>
wireless communication systems are designed to support unsolicited grant service<br>
(UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), extended real-time polling service (ertPS),<br>
non-real-time polling service (nrtPS), and best effort (BE) service.<br>
[0004] Today, various wireless communication systems employ an automatic repeat<br>
request (ARQ) error control procedure for data transmission. In an ARQ error control<br>
procedure, error detection (ED) information (e.g., cyclic redundancy check (CRC)<br>
bits) are added to data to be transmitted. In general, an ARQ error control procedure<br>
employs acknowledgments and timeouts to achieve reliable data transmission. An<br>
acknowledgment is a message sent by a first wireless communication device to a<br>
second wireless communication device to indicate that the first wireless<br>
communication device has correctly received a data frame transmitted by the second<br>
wireless communication device. If the second wireless communication device does<br>
not receive an acknowledgment before expiration of a timeout period, the second<br>
wireless communication device usually re-transmits the data frame until it receives an<br>
acknowledgment or the number of re-transmissions exceeds a predefined number of<br>
re-transmissions. An ARQ protocol may employ a stop-and-wait mode, a go-back-N<br>
mode, or a selective repeat mode.<br>
[0005] A hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ) error control procedure is a<br>
variation of the ARQ error control procedure that is also employed in various wireless<br>
communication systems. In general, a HARQ error control procedure provides better<br>
performance than an ARQ error control procedure in poor signal conditions. In type I<br>
HARQ, both ED and forward error correction (FEC) information (such as Reed-<br>
Solomon code or turbo code) is added to each message prior to transmission. In type<br>
II HARQ, which is more sophisticated than type I HARQ, either ED bits or FEC<br><br>
information and ED bits are transmitted on a given transmission. In general, ED only<br>
adds a couple of bytes to a message which is relatively insignificant for relatively long<br>
messages, e.g., messages having a length of twenty bytes or more. FEC, on the other<br>
hand, can often double or triple a message length with error correction parities for<br>
relatively short messages, e.g., messages have a maximum length of six bytes.<br>
[0006] In an ARQ error control procedure, a transmission must be received error free<br>
for the transmission to pass error detection. In a type II HARQ error control<br>
procedure, a first transmission contains only data and error detection (which is the<br>
same as ARQ). If a message is received error free, no re-transmission is required.<br>
However, if a message is received with one or more errors, a re-transmission of the<br>
message includes both FEC parities and ED bits. If the re-transmission is received<br>
error free, no further action is required. If the re-transmission is received in error,<br>
error correction can be attempted by combining the information received from both<br>
the original transmission and the re-transmission. In general, type I HARQ<br>
experiences capacity loss in strong signal conditions and type II HARQ does not,<br>
because FEC bits are only transmitted on subsequent re-transmissions. In strong<br>
signal conditions, type II HARQ capacity is comparable to ARQ capacity. In poor<br>
signal conditions, type II HARQ sensitivity is comparable with ARQ sensitivity. In<br>
general, the stop-and-wait mode is simpler, but has reduced efficiency. As such,<br>
when the stop-and wait mode is employed, multiple stop-and-wait HARQ processes<br>
are often performed in parallel. In this case, when one HARQ process is waiting for<br>
an acknowledgment, another HARQ process can use the channel to send data.<br>
[0007] HARQ error control procedures may employ chase combining (CC) or<br>
incremental redundancy (IR) for transmitting coded data packets. In CC, incorrectly<br>
received coded data blocks are stored (rather than be discarded), and when the re-<br>
transmitted block is received, the blocks are combined, which can increase the<br>
probability of successful transmission decoding. For downlink HARQ error control, a<br>
serving BS transmits an encoded HARQ packet to a subscriber station (SS). The SS<br>
receives the encoded packet and attempts to decode the encoded packet. If the<br>
decoding is successful, the SS sends an acknowledgement (ACK) to the BS. If the<br><br><br>
decoding is not successful, the SS sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) to the<br>
BS. In response, the BS sends another HARQ attempt. The BS may continue to send<br>
HARQ attempts until the SS successfully decodes the packet and sends an<br>
acknowledgement. For uplink HARQ error control the process is substantially the<br>
reverse of downlink HARQ error control.<br>
[0008] In general, support for quality of service (QoS) is a fundamental part of a<br>
WiMAX medium access control (MAC) layer design. QoS control is achieved by<br>
using a connection-oriented MAC architecture in which all downlink and uplink<br>
connections are controlled by a serving BS. Before any data transmission occurs, a<br>
BS and an SS establish a unidirectional logical link, called a connection, between two<br>
MAC layer peers (one in the BS and one in the SS). Each connection is identified by<br>
a connection identifier (CID), which serves as a temporary address for data<br>
transmissions over the connection. WiMAX also defines the concept of a service<br>
flow, which is a unidirectional flow of packets with a particular set of QoS parameters<br>
that is identified by a service flow identifier (SFID). QoS parameters may include, for<br>
example, traffic priority, maximum sustained traffic rate, maximum burst rate,<br>
minimum tolerable rate, scheduling type, ARQ type, maximum delay, tolerated jitter,<br>
service data unit (SDU) type and size, bandwidth request mechanism to be used, and<br>
transmission protocol data unit (PDU) formation rules. Service flows may be<br>
provisioned through a network management system or created dynamically through<br>
defined signaling mechanisms. The serving BS is responsible for issuing an SFID and<br>
mapping it to a unique CID.<br>
[0009] In various wireless communication systems that employ multiple-access<br>
technology, an arbitrator has usually been implemented to schedule access to shared<br>
resources (e.g., a shared uplink (UL)). In at least some wireless communication<br>
systems, SSs (e.g., mobile stations (MSs)) share a UL on a demand basis and a<br>
scheduler (e.g., a BS scheduler or a network scheduler in communication with a BS)<br>
ensures a committed quality of service (QoS) for all admitted flows in the system. In<br>
a typical wireless communication system that employs multiple-access technology, a<br>
BS attempts to manage QoS to maximize end-to-end user communication (as SSs are<br><br><br>
not usually aware of system constraints). In order to maintain QoS in high-capacity,<br>
high-bandwidth grant-per-SS systems, such as IEEE 802.16d/e communication<br>
systems, decisions made by a serving BS are enforced on served SSs.<br>
[0010] In IEEE 802.16d/e systems, as well as other grant-per-SS systems, while UL<br>
grants are SS based, QoS is connection-based. For example, in IEEE 802.16d/e<br>
systems, UL bandwidth requests reference individual UL connections, while each<br>
bandwidth grant is addressed to a basic MAC management connection (or basic<br>
connection identifier (CID)) of an SS, in contrast to non-basic (or individual) CIDs.<br>
As it is usually indeterminable which bandwidth request is being honored, when an<br>
SS receives a transmission opportunity (e.g., a data grant information element (BE))<br>
directed at a basic CID of the SS, the SS may choose to transmit data for any active<br>
connection. In this way, UL connection QoS for SS-based-granting systems is flawed<br>
as a serving BS cannot usually unambiguously determine to which non-basic CID a<br>
received transmission belongs (i.e., when more than one non-basic CID is active for<br>
an SS).<br>
[0011] According to IEEE 802.16d/e HARQ error control procedures, a data grant IE<br>
contains a HARQ channel ID (ACID) in addition to a basic CID of an SS. To<br>
maximize throughput and to minimize latencies, ACIDs have typically been setup as a<br>
shared resource across multiple connections that have varied QoS parameters, e.g.,<br>
jitter requirements. In addition, in 802.16d/e compliant systems, a number of<br>
maximum re-transmissions for a UL HARQ burst at a physical (PHY) layer has been<br>
advertised in a broadcast message (in an uplink channel descriptor (UCD) message)<br>
and has been the same for all connection types and SSs. In this situation, it is possible<br>
that an attempt by a serving BS to reduce or meet jitter requirements on some jitter-<br>
intolerant flows may be futile. Moreover, a serving BS cannot ascertain which<br>
connection the SS has chosen until successful reception and may inappropriately<br>
continue to schedule re-transmissions for a jitter-intolerant flow. Furthermore, a<br>
scheduler may forego re-transmission attempts for a delay-insensitive flow if it<br>
incorrectly assumes the delay-insensitive flow is a jitter-intolerant flow.<br><br><br>
[0012] With reference to FIGs. 1 and 2, example diagrams 100 and 200 depict a series<br>
of conventional communications between a conventional subscriber station (SS) and a<br>
conventional serving base station (BS) that employs a HARQ error control procedure.<br>
In the diagrams 100 and 200, the SS is executing a Voice over Internet Protocol<br>
(VoIP) application and a web browsing application. The SS has a basic CID of 1, all<br>
ACIDs (e.g., sixteen ACIDs) are available for any CID, and the BS is configured to<br>
provide a maximum of one re-transmission for VoIP traffic, a maximum of three re-<br>
transmissions for web browsing traffic, and a maximum of four re-transmissions for<br>
all other traffic. In a UL of a first frame 102, the BS receives a bandwidth request 101<br>
from the SS for two connection identifiers (CIDs), i.e., a VoIP CID, for example, a<br>
CID 111, and a web browsing CID, for example, a CID 222. In a UL map of a second<br>
frame 104, the BS transmits a first allocation (HARQ subburst 1 for CID 111 having a<br>
basic CID 1; ACID 0; AISN (ARQ Identifier Sequence Number) 0) 103 for the VoIP<br>
CID 111 and a first allocation (HARQ subburst 2 for CID 222 having a basic CID 1;<br>
ACID 1; AISN 0) 105 for the web browsing CID 222. In a UL of a third frame 106,<br>
the SS transmits UL data for the web browsing CID 222 in a first grant 107 (which<br>
the BS allocated for the VoIP CID 111) and UL data for the VoIP CID 111 in a first<br>
grant 109 (which the BS allocated for the web browsing CID 222), as the SS can<br>
choose to send UL data for the VoIP CID 111 and the web browsing CID 222 in<br>
either of the grants 107 and 109.<br>
[0013] Assuming that the UL data for the VoIP CID 111 and the web browsing CID<br>
222 are received by the BS with CRC errors, the BS provides a second allocation 113<br>
for the VoIP CID 111 and a second allocation 115 for the web browsing CID 222 in a<br>
UL map of a fourth frame 108. In a UL of a fifth frame 110, the SS re-transmits UL<br>
data for the web browsing CID 222 in a second grant 117 (which the BS allocated for<br>
the VoIP CID 111) and re-transmits UL data for the VoIP CID 111 in a second grant<br>
119 (which the BS allocated for the web browsing CID 222). Assuming that the UL<br>
data for the VoIP CID 111 and the web browsing CID 222 are again received by the<br>
BS with CRC errors, the BS provides a third allocation 203 for the VoIP CID 111 in a<br>
UL map of a sixth frame 202 and abandons further re-transmissions for the web<br>
browsing CID 222, as the BS does not know that the SS transmitted the UL data for<br><br><br>
the VoIP CID 111 in the grant for the web browsing CID 222, and vice versa. In a<br>
UL of a seventh frame 204, the SS again re-transmits UL data for the VoIP CID 111<br>
in a third grant 205. Assuming that the UL data for the VoIP CID 111 is again<br>
received with CRC errors, the BS provides a fourth allocation (third re-transmission)<br>
207 for the VoIP CID 111 in a UL map of an eighth frame 206. As is illustrated, in a<br>
UL of a ninth frame 208, the SS again re-transmits UL data for VoIP CID 111 in a<br>
fourth grant 209. Assuming that the UL data for the VoIP CID 111 is received<br>
without error, the BS (upon decoding the received packet) determines that the re-<br>
transmissions for the VoIP CID 111 were over-scheduled (i.e., more than one re-<br>
transmission was scheduled) and the re-transmissions for the web browsing CID 222<br>
were under-scheduled (i.e., less than three re-transmissions were scheduled).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention, specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced<br>
are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice<br>
the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and<br>
that logical, architectural, programmatic, mechanical, electrical and other changes<br>
may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The<br>
following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the<br>
scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
[0020] While the discussion herein is generally directed to a WiMAX compliant<br>
wireless communication system, it should be appreciated that the techniques disclosed<br>
herein are broadly applicable to wireless communication systems that implement error<br>
control through re-transmissions of data, such as ARQ error control and HARQ error<br>
control, and that employ quality of service (QoS) classes. As used herein, the term<br>
"coupled" includes both a direct electrical connection between blocks or components<br>
and an indirect electrical connection between blocks or components achieved using<br>
intervening blocks or components. As is also used herein, the term "subscriber<br>
station" and "user equipment" are synonymous and are utilized to broadly denote a<br>
wireless communication device.<br>
[0021] As noted above, in the prior art, a serving BS is incapable of specifying how<br>
many re-transmissions a connection should use, as the serving BS has been incapable<br>
of determining which connection an SS used for an allocation until successful receipt<br>
of transmitted data. According to the present disclosure, a technique is disclosed that<br>
provides a serving BS a priori knowledge of a re-transmission identifier, such as a<br>
HARQ channel identification (ACID) or an ARQ Identifier Sequence Number<br><br><br>
(AISN), used for a transmission/re-transmission. In this case, the re-transmission<br>
identifier belongs to a group of one or more re-transmission identifiers whose number<br>
of allocated re-transmissions is also known to the serving BS. In this manner, a<br>
serving BS can ensure that QoS parameters are met for a connection.<br>
[0022] In order to optimize system efficiency and maximize user experience, a<br>
scheduler should generally ensure that latency/jitter requirements for time/jitter<br>
sensitive applications are met. For IEEE 802.16d/e, as well as other grant-per-SS<br>
technologies, a technique is needed to balance system requirements of connection-<br>
based QoS and SS allocation flexibility of SS-based grants. According to various<br>
aspects of the present disclosure, techniques are disclosed that efficiently utilize<br>
physical (PHY) layer resources to meet medium access control (MAC) level<br>
committed QoS. In this manner, BS performance is increased and end-to-end<br>
latencies for uplink data flows are decreased. According to the present disclosure, re-<br>
transmission identifiers, such as ACIDs, are assigned in a manner that facilitates BS<br>
control over usage of HARQ channels for UL flows. In this case, a scheduler can<br>
generally ensure that a UL flow is being used by an SS for a known purpose and, thus,<br>
maintain an appropriate QoS for the UL flow.<br>
[0023] In a subscriber basic capability (SBC) procedure between a BS and an SS<br>
(during network entry of the SS before any connections are created), a maximum<br>
number of ACIDs that may be used between the BS and the SS is typically negotiated.<br>
At a later point, during flow creation, ACIDs used for a flow are selected through<br>
negotiation. In general, the selected ACIDs are a subset of the ACIDs known from<br>
the SBC procedure. In a conventional implementation, each ACID can be shared<br>
across multiple flows and each ACID can potentially go through the same maximum<br>
number of re-transmissions. According to at least one embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure, a technique is employed that generally prevents more re-transmissions<br>
than a connection can tolerate by dividing a pool of available ACIDs (during flow<br>
connection) into groups that have a different number of maximum re-transmission<br>
attempts that can be tolerated and still meet an application dependent latency/jitter<br>
requirement. While the discussion herein focuses on meetir.g application<br><br>
latency/jitter requirements (based on a maximum number of re-transmissions), it is<br>
contemplated that the techniques disclosed herein are broadly applicable to other QoS<br>
parameters.<br>
[0024] According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a technique for operating a<br>
wireless communication device includes assigning re-transmission identifiers, such as<br>
automatic repeat request (ARQ) channel identifiers or hybrid automatic repeat request<br>
(HARQ) channel identifiers (herein collectively referred to as ACIDs) or ARQ<br>
Identifier Sequence Numbers (AISNs), to at least a first re-transmission identifier<br>
group and a second re-transmission identifier group, wherein each re-transmission<br>
identifier group is associated with a different quality of service parameter. The<br>
technique identifies whether a committed quality of service is met for a connection<br>
based on whether a communication on the connection is associated with the first<br>
group or the second group.<br>
[0025] According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a wireless<br>
communication device includes a scheduler that is configured to assign re-<br>
transmission identifiers to at least a first re-transmission identifier group and a second<br>
re-transmission identifier group. The first and second re-transmission identifier<br>
groups are associated with different quality of service parameters. The scheduler is<br>
also configured to identify whether a committed quality of service is met for a<br>
connection based on whether a communication on the connection is associated with<br>
the first group or the second group.<br>
[0026] According to a different aspect of the present disclosure, a wireless<br>
communication device includes a transceiver and a processor that is coupled to the<br>
transceiver. The processor is configured to assign re-transmission identifiers to at<br>
least a first re-transmission identifiergroup and a second re-transmission<br>
identifiergroup, wherein each re-transmission identifiergroup is associated with a<br>
different quality of service parameter. The processor is also configured to identify<br>
whether a committed quality of service is met for a connection based on whether a<br>
communication on the connection is associated with the first group or the second<br>
group.<br><br><br>
[0027] With reference to FIGs. 3 and 4, example diagrams 300 and 400 depict a series<br>
of communications between a subscriber station (SS) and a serving base station (BS)<br>
that are included within a wireless communication system that is configured<br>
according to the present disclosure. The system employs an error control procedure<br>
that involves re-transmissions of unacknowledged or negatively acknowledged data,<br>
such as data that is erroneously received or not received at all, for example, a HARQ<br>
error control procedure, and groups re-transmission identifiers, such as ACIDs and<br>
AISNs, based on quality of service (QoS) parameters. For example, re-transmission<br>
identifiers may be placed in groups that correspond to the maximum number of re-<br>
transmissions that can be initiated while meeting the QoS parameters. For example,<br>
ACIDs may be grouped during connection creation as follows: ACID 0, ACID 1,<br>
ACID 2, and ACID 3 may be allocated to jitter-intolerant connections that use zero<br>
HARQ re-transmissions; ACID 4, ACID 5, ACID 6, and ACID 7 may be allocated to<br>
less jitter-intolerant connections that use one HARQ re-transmission; ACID 8, ACID<br>
9, ACID 10, and ACID 11 may be allocated to connections with intermediate jitter<br>
requirements that use two HARQ re-transmissions; and ACID 12, ACID 13, ACID<br>
14, and ACID 15 may be allocated to jitter tolerant connections that use three HARQ<br>
re-transmissions. As another example, ACIDs may be grouped during connection<br>
creation as follows: ACID 0, ACID 1, ACID 2, ACID 3, ACID 4, ACID 5, ACID 6,<br>
and ACID 7 may be allocated to jitter/delay sensitive connections that use two or less<br>
HARQ re-transmissions; and ACID 8, ACID 9, ACID 10, ACID 11, ACID 12, ACID<br>
13, ACID 14, and ACID 15 may be allocated to jitter/delay insensitive connections<br>
that use three or more HARQ re-transmissions.<br>
[0028] As yet another example, ACIDs may be grouped during connection creation as<br>
follows: ACID 0 and ACID 1 may be allocated to jitter-intolerant connections that use<br>
zero HARQ re-transmissions; ACID 2, ACID 3, ACID 4, and ACID 5 may be<br>
allocated to less jitter-intolerant connections that use one HARQ re-transmission;<br>
ACID 6, ACID 7, ACID 8, ACID 9, and ACID 10 may be allocated to connections<br>
with intermediate jitter requirements that use two HARQ re-transmissions; and ACID<br>
11, ACID 12, ACID 13, ACID 14, and ACID 15 may be allocated to jitter tolerant<br>
connections that use three HARQ re-transmissions. It should be appreciated that<br><br><br>
ACIDs may be grouped in two or more groups and more or less than sixteen ACIDs<br>
may be employed in a wireless communication system. When a stop-and-wait HARQ<br>
error control protocol is employed, connections generally do not require a large<br>
number (e.g., greater than four) of ACIDs due to the nature of the stop-and-wait<br>
HARQ error control protocol and fixed inter-arrival service data unit (SDU) rate.<br>
[0029] In the example diagrams 300 and 400, the SS is executing a first wireless<br>
packet data application, such as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application,<br>
and a second wireless packet data application, such as a web browsing application.<br>
However, implementation of any application involving a wireless transfer of packet<br>
data may be applicable here, such as file transfer, video, and so on. The SS has a<br>
basic CID of 1, all ACIDs (e.g., sixteen ACIDs) are assigned to respective groups that<br>
correspond to different QoS parameters, and the BS is configured to provide a<br>
maximum of one re-transmission for VoIP traffic, three re-transmissions for web<br>
browsing traffic, and four maximum re-transmissions. In a UL of a first frame 302,<br>
the BS receives a bandwidth request 301 from the SS for two connection identifiers<br>
(CIDs), i.e., a VoIP CID with a CID value 111 and a web browsing CID with a CID<br>
value 222. In a UL map of a second frame 304, the BS transmits a first allocation<br>
(HARQ subburst 1 for CID 111 having a basic CID 1; ACID 0; AISN 0) 303 for the<br>
VoIP CID 111 and a first allocation (HARQ subburst 2 for CID 222 having a basic<br>
CID 1; ACID 11; AISN 0) 305 for the web browsing CID 222. In this case, ACID 0<br>
is assigned to an ACID group that uses one HARQ re-transmission and ACID 11 is<br>
assigned to another ACID group that uses three HARQ re-transmissions. In a UL of a<br>
third frame 206, the SS transmits UL data (for the VoIP CID 111) in a first grant 307<br>
(allocated by the BS for the VoIP CID 111) and UL data for the web browsing CID<br>
222 in a first grant 309 (allocated by the BS for the web browsing CID 222), as the SS<br>
is limited to sending UL data for the VoIP CID 111 and the web browsing CID 222 in<br>
the grants 307 and 309, respectively.<br>
[0030] Assuming that the UL data for the VoIP CID 111 and the web browsing CID<br>
222 are received by the BS with CRC errors, the BS provides a second allocation 313<br>
for the VoIP CID 111 and a second allocation 315 for the web browsing CID 222 in a<br><br><br>
UL map of a fourth frame 308. In a UL of a fifth frame 310, the SS re-transmits UL<br>
data for the VoIP CID 111 in a second grant 317 and re-transmits UL data for the web<br>
browsing CID 222 in a second grant 319. Assuming that the UL data for the VoIP<br>
CID 111 and the web browsing CID 222 are again received by the BS with CRC<br>
errors, the BS provides a third allocation 403 for the web browsing CID 222 in a UL<br>
map of a sixth frame 402 and abandons further re-transmissions for the VoIP CID<br>
111, as the BS knows that the SS transmitted the UL data for the VoIP CID 111 in the<br>
grant for the VoIP CID 111. In a UL of a seventh frame 404, the SS again re-<br>
transmits UL data for the VoIP CID 111 in a third grant 405. Assuming that the UL<br>
data for the web browsing CID 222 is again received with CRC errors, the BS<br>
provides a fourth allocation 407 for the web browsing CID 222 in a UL map of an<br>
eighth frame 406. As is illustrated, in a UL of a ninth frame 408, the SS again re-<br>
transmits UL data for web browsing CID 222 in a fourth grant 409. Assuming that<br>
the UL data for the web browsing CID 222 is received without error, the BS has<br>
maintained a committed QoS for the web browsing CID 222, as well as the VoIP CID<br>
111.<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG. 5, an example process 500 is illustrated that is<br>
employed at a serving base station (BS) to determine whether a committed quality of<br>
service (QoS) is being met for a connection in a wireless communication system. In<br>
block 502 the process 500 is initiated, at which point control transfers to block 504.<br>
In block 504, the BS (or a scheduler associated with the BS) assigns multiple re-<br>
transmission identifiers, such ACIDs and AISNs, to at least a first re-transmission<br>
identifier group and a second re-transmission identifier group that are each associated<br>
with different QoS parameters. As noted above, re-transmission identifiers may be<br>
assigned to more than two groups depending upon how many QoS classes are<br>
warranted for a particular situation. Moreover, the number of groups and the re-<br>
transmission identifiers assigned thereto may change over time. Next, in block 506,<br>
the serving BS (or the scheduler associated with the BS) identifies whether a<br>
committed QoS is met for a connection based on whether a communication on the<br>
connection is associated with the first group or the second group. Then, in block 508,<br>
the BS transmits the re-transmission identifier during connection creation or in a<br><br><br>
broadcast message that is provided in a UL map. Following block 508, the process<br>
500 terminates in block 510 and control returns to a calling process.<br>
[0032] With reference to FIG. 6, an example wireless communication system 600<br>
includes multiple subscriber stations (SSs) 604, e.g., mobile stations (MSs), that are<br>
configured to communicate with a remote device (not shown) via a serving base<br>
station (BS) 602. In various embodiments, the system 600 is configured to maintain a<br>
quality of service of a connection based on an assignment of a re-transmission<br>
identifier to a re-transmission identifier group. Each SS 604 may transmit/receive<br>
various information, e.g., voice, images, video, and audio, to/from various sources,<br>
e.g., another SS, or an Internet connected server. As is depicted, the BS 602 is<br>
coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) 606, which is coupled to a public<br>
switched telephone network (PSTN) 608. Alternatively, the system 600 may not<br>
employ the MSC 606 when voice service is based on Voice over Internet Protocol<br>
(VoIP) technology, where calls to the PSTN 608 are typically routed through a<br>
gateway (not shown).<br>
[0033] The BS 602 includes a transmitter and a receiver (not individually shown),<br>
both of which are coupled to a control unit (not shown), which may be, for example, a<br>
microprocessor, a microcontroller, a programmable logic device (PLD), or an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is configured to execute a software<br>
system to perform at least some of the various techniques disclosed herein. Similarly,<br>
the SSs 604 include a transmitter and a receiver (not individually shown) coupled to a<br>
control unit (not shown), which may be, for example, a microprocessor, a<br>
microcontroller, a PLD, or an ASIC that is configured to execute a software system to<br>
perform at least some of the various techniques disclosed herein. The control unit<br>
may also be coupled to a display (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD)) and an input<br>
device (e.g., a keypad).<br>
[0034] Accordingly, techniques have been described herein that allow a BS to<br>
maintain a committed QoS for all applications by allocating available re-transmission<br>
identifiers, such as ACIDs and AISNs, (from a pool of re-transmission identifiers) to<br>
re-transmission identifier groups based on QoS parameters. In employing the<br><br>
disclosed techniques, a serving BS essentially implements a QoS-based grant<br>
procedure, as opposed to an SS-based grant procedure. This allows an SS to choose<br>
among connections with the same QoS constraints. According to various aspects of<br>
the present disclosure, a re-transmission identifier assignment is sent to an SS during<br>
connection creation. In addition, usage of the assigned re-transmission identifiers<br>
may be broadcast in UL maps transmitted from the BS to the SS in a downlink portion<br>
of a frame whenever data is transmitted for an associated flow. In summary, the<br>
present disclosure provides techniques that substantially maintain committed QoS<br>
(e.g., maximum latency, tolerated jitter, etc.) for a connection that is associated with a<br>
wireless packet data application (e.g., a time-sensitive application such as a gaming<br>
application or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application) while still facilitating<br>
implementation of packet data re-transmission, such as HARQ, error control<br>
procedures.<br>
[0035] As used herein, a software system can include one or more objects, agents,<br>
threads, subroutines, separate software applications, two or more lines of code or<br>
other suitable software structures operating in one or more separate software<br>
applications, on one or more different processors, or other suitable software<br>
architectures.<br>
[0036] As will be appreciated, the processes in preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention may be implemented using any combination of computer programming<br>
software, firmware or hardware. As a preparatory step to practicing the invention in<br>
software, the computer programming code (whether software or firmware) according<br>
to a preferred embodiment is typically stored in one or more machine readable storage<br>
mediums, such as fixed (hard) drives, diskettes, optical disks, magnetic tape,<br>
semiconductor memories (e.g., read-only memories (ROMs), programmable ROMs<br>
(PROMs), etc.), thereby making an article of manufacture in accordance with the<br>
invention. The article of manufacture containing the computer programming code is<br>
used by either executing the code directly from the storage device, by copying the<br>
code from the storage device into another storage device, such as a hard disk, random<br>
access memory (RAM), etc., or by transmitting the code for remote execution. The<br><br><br>
method form of the invention may be practiced by combining one or more machine-<br>
readable storage devices containing the code according to the present disclosure with<br>
appropriate standard computer hardware to execute the code contained therein.<br>
[0037] Although the invention is described herein with reference to specific<br>
embodiments, various modifications and changes can be made without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly, the<br>
specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive<br>
sense, and all such modifications are intended to be included with the scope of the<br>
