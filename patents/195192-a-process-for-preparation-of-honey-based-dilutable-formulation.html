				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of honey based dilutable formulation.<br>
Honey is well known as a sweetener in different parts of the world from early times and finds use in several cuisines. The high content of sugars, small amounts of amino acids, lipids along with some vitamins and minerals impart high nutritional value. Honey is reported to have medicinal and antimicrobial properties (1999, Aparna and Rajalakshmi). Formulations containing honey are being used as beverages in a way similar to the use of common carbonated/non-carbonated beverages.<br>
There are a number of patents on the use of honey in food products.<br>
Reference may be given to German Federal Republic Patent Application; DE 38 33 937 A1, 1990 by Meier, wherein an alcoholic beverage having honey as one of the ingredients has been prepared. The other ingredients used are garlic, lemon juice, basil, aniseed, ginger, fennel and sugar. However, this preparation containing honey is an alcoholic beverage.<br>
Reference may be given to French Patent Application by Ferte and Ferte (1986) wherein a process for the preparation of stabilized honey drink containing 20% honey which is dissolved in a flavouring solvent before carbonation has been given. In this preparation pasteurized honey is dissolved in a flavouring solvent before carbonation and serves as a high-energy drink for sports people and in syrups. However it is a honey drink but not a dilutable formulation.<br>
Reference may be made to West German Patent Application by Jost (1971) wherein a process for the preparation of honey-based beer has been developed. Here equal parts of honey and water or cider are mixed and alcohol is added to a 20% volume content; the mixture is then added to 10 times the quantity of strong beer, resulting in a bitter sweet, palatable full-bodied drink. However this is a process for honey based beer and not non-alcoholic dilutable honey formulation.<br>
Reference may be made to German Federal Republic Patent Application by Aisch (2001) wherein a process for the preparation of beer mixed drink based on lightly hopped beer and honey has been developed. Here honey is purified, liquefied and mixed with the beer, the mixture is filtered and UHT processed or pasteurized to inactivate the enzymes. However this product is also an alcoholic drink.<br>
Reference may be made to German Federal Republic Patent Application (1974) wherein a method for producing a sparkling wine-like beverage from bee's honey in a fermenting process has been described. This is made by adjusting the acid content of unfermented, water diluted, bees honey to the desired acid content of the end product by adding a mixture o fruit acids or by mixing bees honey with high acid sparkling fruit wine like gooseberry wine. Yeast enriched with nutrient salts is then added to the mixture which is then subjected to alcoholic fermentation while maintaining CO2 pressure and further processed in a conventional manner. This method bypasses the intermediate stage of producing mead and provides a beverage, which is not excessively sweet. But this is again a process for alcoholic beverage based on honey.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent, US 5153 019, US 707 468 by Hammond (1992) wherein a process for rice bran honey based beverage product has been described. Here a powdered beverage base is described which comprises stabilized rice bran, non heat-treated honey free from coliform bacteria, spores and proteins and whey protein concentrate. The base may also contain a powdered milk component or a powdered fruit juice component, sweetener and/ or flavouring agent. This process differs from the present invention, in being a powdered beverage base and having rice bran, honey and whey concentrate as the major ingredients.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent by Schanze (1984) wherein a process for the production of a concentrate containing a bee product, and its use has been described. The bee products include bee pollen, bee bread, propolis or honey. The bee products are added to concentrates of whole milk, skimmed milk, protein enriched filtrates from membrane separation of milk, various wheys or other by products<br>
of milk industry or mixtures thereof; the mixture is then stirred to give a homogenous dispersion and concentrated by evaporation and dried. Carbohydrates, yeasts, single cell proteins or other microorganisms and additives may optionally be added to the bee product/milk product. The described concentrate may be used as a dietetic preparation. This process differs from the present invention in being a concentrate and not a dilutable formulation for beverage.<br>
Reference may be made to German Federal Republic Patent Application by Schanze (1983) wherein a process for the manufacture of a biologically high-value natural food concentrate using honey or honey mixed with other bee products, a high value protein product or a mixture of high protein products, mineral substances and if appropriate fibre and /or carbohydrate, has been developed. The end product contains more than 40% by weight of honey. This product differs from the present invention in being a food concentrate than a dilutable honey based formulation.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent by Stering (1981), wherein a composition containing honey with KL-ascorbic acid and citric acid, which can be used as bread spread and also a beverage concentrate has been described. This composition has the desirable properties of each of the ingredients but does not exhibit the excessive sweetness of honey. Here the beverage is produced by diluting the concentrate with water. This invention has some similarities with the present invention. However, the present invention does not involve the addition of ascorbic acid and this formulation has natural flavourants namely ginger oleoresin and includes the addition of fruit juices in the form of mango squash and lime cordial and the formulation so developed can be diluted suitably to obtain the beverage.<br>
The protein content in honey and its effect on precipitation of beverage was studied by Peng and Pan (1994). It was found that in beverages containing honey, total weight and protein contents of precipitates were positively correlated with the protein content of honey.<br>
A study on the development of pumpkin citron honey drink was carried out by Young Lee Park (1995). The beverage contained water-soluble pumpkin paste (WSP), raw citron, honey, raw pumpkin, water and starch. Flavour, color and overall acceptability of the beverage were found to be acceptable by sensory evaluation.<br>
Kedzierski (1976) determined the contents of zinc, iron, copper and tin in juices and honey beverages using atomic absorption spectrometry.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of honey based dilutable formulation, which is spice-based (ginger) or fruit based (mango and lime) that can be diluted suitably to obtain honey beverage.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a process for the preparation of honey based dilutable formulation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is utilization of honey to develop a flavoured beverage formulation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a dilutable formulation, which can be easily made into a ready to serve health drink in catering establishments and railway canteens.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide natural flavour to the honey beverage formulation by using fruit or spice.<br>
