COMPETE SPECIFICATION<br>
1.     TITLE OF INVENTION:<br>
Perpetual calender device to find week day of any date of any year (infinite years).<br>
2.     NAME OF APPLICANT WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS:<br>
Dr. BHOMRAH JASWANT SINGH<br>
B-9, ABHINANDAN, RATAN NAGAR COMPLEX,<br>
OPP. HOTEL PALMLAND HOTEL<br>
B H A R U C H. 392001. (GUJARAT) INDIA.<br>
NATIONALITY	: INDIAN.<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION:<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.    ,<br><br><br>
The invention relates to perpetual calendar device to find week day of any date of any year (year 1583 onwards Julian calendar) in a simple and easily understandable manner. The invention also avoids any cross-reference table or any complex mechanism for the said purpose.<br>
o<br>
In 1930 William J. Sidis was awarded a patent ( USP 1,784,117) for a perpetual calendar made of two cardboard disk shaped device to find week day of a date. The device also contained a conversion table showing how many years have to be added or subtracted for years not listed in the year section of the disk.<br>
Mardello Frank T (US Appl. No. 826546) applied for a patent in 1997 for his invention on alcohol-tobacco electronic perpetual calendar. It is an electronic device to find the age of an individual whether he could purchase alcohol or tobacco or not.<br>
Sean Barton has developed a 4000 year perpetual calendar made up of stiff paper for which a patent has been filed -(<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e0f0c585d2e030101001d1a070d05400d010007">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br><br>
Literature survey shows various type of perpetual calendars, but surprisingly most of such perpetual calendar models are suitable for a limited periods only e.g. perpetual calendar for 100 years, or 4000 years or 10,000 years etc. Some of perpetual calendars have been developed for specific purpose only e.g. to make yearly calendar or calendar for the US holidays etc.<br>
The perpetual calendar device invented here is unique in its concept easy to understand and used to find the week day of any date of any year. The invention unlike other patents has no limits as far as years are concerned. Even the digital electronic devices such as calculators, computers provided with the perpetual calendars available in the market are suitable for 100 years or so only.<br>
Thus this invention has crossed all the time barriers because this device is suitable for infinite years even for billion years.<br>
In India an English calendar is used everywhere e.g. wedding cards, newspapers, court cases,. Government offices, account books, festival holidays etc. What we use is one year calendar to seek week days, but we wish to correlate any old date with a week day we have to refer an<br>
3<br><br>
old " Panchang * which are not available all the time nor at all the places.<br>
Considering this demand in my mind, I tried to invent a perpetual calendar devxce to find a weekday of any date of any year (with no time limits).<br>
METHODS OF USING THE INVENTED PERPETUAL CALENDAR DEVICE:<br>
The working procedure of finding a weekday of any date in this invented perpetual calendar is as illustrated below using an example:<br>
Example: Find out the week day of 20th October 1945.<br>
•	Type of Year -1945 A Non Leap Year (NLY)<br>
•	Determination of year code - To find an year code, we have always to multiply the year with a constant 0.0357142 as shown below :<br>
1945x 0.0357142 = 69. 46 42 86 Here the year code for 1945 is 46<br>
4<br><br>
To determine the week day using the perpetual<br>
calendar device the two step procedure is as shown<br>
below:<br>
First Step :<br>
o Year Code 46 belongs to 1st column shown on the printed plastic sheet. The date 20, under the heading "DAHTES", comes in the 7th row. Now put the wire probe P1 in the hole where the first column and seventh row intersect each other. We see the first bulb lights up. This lighted bulb column indicates the column selected for second step.<br>
Second Step:<br>
o Since first bulb lights up, the first column is automatically selected for second step. Now to select the row, it is seen, that month October, under the heading NLY, occurs in the first row.<br>
The probe wire P2 is now inserted in the hole where first column and first row intersect. The second bulb, below which SAT is written, lights up.<br>
Therefore 20th October 1945 was a SATURDAY.<br>
5<br><br>
If this procedure is followed strictly there is no chance of getting a wrong day of the given date.<br>
3.     DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The invented perpetual calendar device, used for determination of weekday of any date of any year, consists of following parts.<br>
1.	The front printed plastic sheet<br>
2.	The printed circuit board (PCB)<br>
3.	Electrical bulbs<br>
4.	Battery<br>
5.	Probes<br>
Details of each part along with the drawings as and where required and its working are described below. It is also being explained how various parts are assembled and connected with each other.<br>
The whole perpetual calendar when assembled looks like a box, which could be of any shape, rectangular or circular or any other shape, the basic features remaining the same.<br>
The front side of the box is a printed plastic sheet on which year codes, dates, months and weekdays are printed. This plastic sheet also contains two sets of 49 holes and<br>
6<br><br>
two rectangular slots below each set of holes. Two loose wires, other end of which are soldered to the negative terminal of a 3 volt battery are also seen, this open and of the wire is called probe P1 and probe P2 . Forty nine holes are arranged in the form of seven columns and seven rows. Each column represents a group of year codes. Year code is determined by multiplying the year with a constant 0.0357142. After obtaining the product, the number formed by two digits just after the decimal point is called "year code". Dates of a month are divided into seven groups and each group is represented by a specific row.<br>
Below these holes there is a slot for 7 bulbs. These seven bulbs represent seven columns for the second set of 49 holes and again there are seven rows.<br>
Months are printed on the left side of these holes. Twelve months of a year are grouped into seven rows. At the same time, months are divided into two groups viz. months belonging to non leap year (NLY) and months belonging to years ending with 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48,52,56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92 and 96 or the years which are divisible by 4 (Y/4). Therefore when this perpetual calendar device invention is used, year belongs to NLY type  or Y/4 type is to be determined first.<br>
7<br><br>
Below these holes there is a rectangular slot for another set of seven bulbs. Below each bulb a weekday of the week is printed. The front printed sheet as described above is shown in Fig-1.<br>
Second major component of the invented perpetual calendar is the printed circuit board or PCB. This PCB is specifically designed and developed the make it suitabfle for use even for billion years, irrespective of four variables viz. date, month, non leap years, years divisible by four and weekdays. It has been designed to make it simple and easy to understand. Design of PCB is shown in Fig-2.<br>
PCB has two electrical circuits, each circuit is independent of each other, Each electrical circuit has 49 electrical contact points arranged in the fashion of seven columns and seven rows. These contact points matches exactly with the 49 holes present in the printed plastic sheet.<br>
Below these electrical points in the PCB there are seven electrical bulbs. The positive end of these bulbs is soldered to positive terminal of the 3 volt battery. To the negative terminal of the battery, one end of wire is soldered, the other end of this wire is kept loose and is<br>
8<br><br>
called probe P1 . Similarly there is another probe called P2. When this probe is connected to any point of contact by inserting the wire through hole the circuit is completed and one of the bulbs gets lighted. Though both the circuits are similar in construction, their correlation with the matter printed on the printed plastic sheet is quite different from each other.<br>
The first circuit correlates year codes and the dates, the bulbs under this circuit works as column for the other circuit and correlates with the months. The bulbs below this circuit shows week days of a week.<br>
Printed plastic sheet and the PCB are joined with each other with the help of screws. Bulbs fixed on the PCB exactly fits into the slots on the printed plastic sheet.<br><br>
4.     I claim,<br>
(1) The device consisting of a plastic sheet kept over a printed circuit board and joined with the help of screws : the lator having two sets of electrical circuits, independent of each other, but one below the other and each circuit connected to a set of seven bulbs, placed below the circuit, the positive terminal of all the bulbs are connected to the positive terminal of the 3 volt battery, the negative terminal of the battery is soldered to two probes P1 and P2; the plastic sheet having two sets of 49 holes arranged in the form of seven rows and seven columns when placed properly over the printed circuit board completely covers the electrical circuits, showing contact points through holes and also two sets of seven bulbs, the upper set of holes correlates the Dates and the year codes so when probe P1is inserted into the desired hole due to completion of an electrical circuit, one of the bulbs placed below the set lights up; the lower set of 49 holes correlates the month and week days, hence when the probe P2 is inserted into the proper hole one of the bulbs is lighted, seven bulbs show Week days of the week.<br>
