• Filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing an optically active chrysanthemic acid (cydopropanecarboxylic acid) derivative. Description of the Related Art<br>
Optically active cydopropanecarboxylic acid derivatives are important intermediates for drugs and pesticides.   For example, (+)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid known as chrysanthemum mono-carboxylic acid constitutes an acid component of synthetic pyrethroid insecticide.<br>
The insecticidal activity of a trans-pyrethroid ester is usually higher than that of a cis-isomer. Particularly, pyrethroid esters of (+)-trans-chrysanthemum mono-carboxylic acid(hereinafter referred to as "chrysanthemic acid") or chrysanthemic acid enriched with the (+)-trans-chrysanthemlc acid have exhibited excellent insecticidal activity.   Accordingly, an industrially advantageous method to produce (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid or chrysanthemic acid enriched with the (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid has been desired.<br>
As a method of producing an optically active chrysanthemic add derivative by using a synthetic technique, there has been known a method of reacting a (±)-trans-chrysanthemum mono-carboxylic acid or trans rich (±)-chrysanthemum mono-carboxylic acid with an optical resolution agent, which are an optically active amine, to obtain an optically active chrysanthemic acid (JP46-20382B/1971, JP54-37130B/1979, JP49-109344A/1974 and JP51-23497B/1976). However, these optical resolution methods were not always satisfactory, because<br><br>
of low yield of the desired optically active chrysanthemic acid.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors have intensively studied.   As a result, they have found that, when chrysanthemic acid optically enriched with one isomer, e.g. (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid can be purified by crystallization using an optical active amine In the production of an optically active chrysanthemic acid, whereby (+)-trans-chrysanthemlc acid having excellent optical purity can be obtained with surprisingly good efficiency compared with the case of using racemic chrysanthemic acid, and trans isomer ratio of the chrysanthemic acid can also be improved efficiently when trans isomer having not less than 50% trans-isomer ratio are applied.<br>
SUIVIMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides:<br>
1.	a method for producing an optically active chrysanthemic acid whose<br>
trans isomer ratio and optical purity are improved, which comprises:<br>
reacting chrysanthemic acid having a trans isomer ratio of not less than 50% and an optical purity of not less than 10% e.e. with an optically active organic amine to optically resolve said chrysanthemic acid; and<br>
2.	a method for producing an optically active chrysanthemic acid whose<br>
trans isomer ratio and optical purity are improved, which comprises:<br>
reacting 2,5-dlmethyl-2,4-hexadiene with diazoacetates of the formula (I):<br>
N2CHCO2R7	(I)<br>
wherein R7 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a<br>
cycloalkyi group, in the presence of an asymmetric copper complex to<br>
produce an optically active chrysanthemic acid ester (cyclopropanation<br>
step),<br><br>
contacting chrysanthemic add esters with an acid or base to form chrysanthemic acid (hydrolysis step); and<br>
optically resolving chrysanthemic acid using at least one optically active organic amine selected from those of the formulas (A-1), (A-2), (A-3) and (A-4) shown below (optical resolution step).<br>

organic amine to optically resolve said chrysanthemic acid.<br>
Chrysanthemic acid having a trans isomer ratio of not less than 50% and an optical purity of not less than 10% e.e can be obtained by any method, for example, it can be produced in the following manner, -r; ,<br>
In the present Invention, the ^^optical purity" or e.e.% of (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid In the trans isomer is calcuiatjBd t)ased on the analysis using optically active column and is defined, for example, by the following equation: 100 X {[(+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid   -   (-)-trans-chrysanthemic acid] / [(+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid   +     (-)-trans-chrysanthemic acid]}.<br>
The optically active chrysanthemic acid can be obtained by reacting 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene with diazoacetate of the formula (I):<br>
N2CHCO2R7<br><br>
wherein R; represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a cydoalkyl group, in the presence of an asymmetric copper complex to produce optically active chrysanthemic acid esters (cydopropanation step); and decomposing chrysanthemic acid esters with an alkali or acid (hydrolysis step).<br>

Optical resolution is performed by reacting the optically active chrysanthemic acid with an optically active amine (optical resolution agent) of the formula (A-1), (A-2), (A-3) or (A-4).<br>
The optical resolution is usually performed in a solvent. As the solvent, there can be used aromatic hydrocarbons suoh as benzene, toluene and xylene; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and heptane; alcohols such as water, methanol and ethanoi; ketones such as acetone and methyl Isobutyi ketone; and ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran.   These solvents may be used alone or in combination thereof.<br>
The amount of the solvent varies depending on the solvent and conditions of the post treatments and is not specifically limited, and an optimum amount is optionally set according to the respective conditions.<br>
The amount of the optical resolution agent is usually from about 0.2 to 1.2 mol, and preferably from about 0.3 to 1.1 mol, per mol of chrysanthemic acid.<br>
The optical resolution agent and chrysanthemic acid are usually dissolved in the solvent above under stimng or standing. The mixture may be heated to dissolve, if necessary.<br>
A dlastereomer crystal comprising an optical resolution agent and optically active chrysanthemic acid is usually formed to deposit from the solution on standing at an ambient temperature or by cooling the solution.<br>
The de[)osited crystal may be collected as it is, or alternatively, it may be totally or partially dissolved by heating and then cooled to deposit the crystal, if necessary.<br><br>
The dissolution and deposition is usually conducted at a temperature ranging from -20 to 150°C, and preferably from -10 to 100°C.<br>
The deposited diastereomer crystal is usually separated by filtration. The diastereomer salt separated as a crystal is then decomposed with an acid or alkali and extracted to obtain the optically active chrysanthemic acid with higher trans ratio and optical purity. The used optical resolution agent can be recovered.<br>
For example, an optically active chrysanthemic acid is obtained by decomposing the diastereomer salt, obtained by means of the above method, with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid and extracting the resultant with an organic solvent.   Furthermore, the agent for optical resolution is recovered by making the aqueous layer weak alkali and extracting it.<br>
Alternatively, the optical resolution agent can be recovered by decomposing the disatereomer salt, obtained by means of the above method, with a base such as sodium hydroxide, and extracting the resultant with an organic solvent in the weak alkali condition.   Thereafter, the aqueous layer is acidified and extracted, thereby making it possible to obtain an optically active chrysanthemic acid. The optical resolution agent recovered by these methods can be reused. Next a description will be made to the method for producing an optically active chrysanthemic acid, which comprises reacting 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene with diazoacetates of the formula (I) as defined above, in the presence of an asymmetric copper complex to produce optically active chrysanthemic acid esters (cyclopropanation step); and contacting the chrysanthemic acid ester with an alkali or acid (hydrolysis step).<br>

The optically active chrysanthemic acid esters with considerably good purity can be obtained in the above reaction by distilling off the solvent, but can be optionally isolated by a conventional method such as distillation and column chromatography, if necessary.<br>
