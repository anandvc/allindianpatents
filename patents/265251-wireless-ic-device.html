				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
WIRELESS IC DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless IC device<br>
for a radio frequency identification (RFID) system which<br>
allows noncontact data communication via electromagnetic<br>
waves.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, RFID systems have been used as article<br>
management systems. For information transmission, an RFID<br>
system allows noncontact communication between a<br>
reader/writer that generates an induction field and a<br>
wireless IC device that is attached to an article and stores<br>
predetermined information.<br>
[0003]<br>
Fig. 1 is an external perspective view illustrating an<br>
example of a metal article to which an IC tag label<br>
described in Patent Document 1 is attached.<br>
[0004]<br>
An IC tag label 102 has a rectangular thin film-like<br>
shape. The IC tag 102 has an IC chip 102a at the center<br>
thereof and a thin-film antenna 102b in an outer region<br><br>
thereof. To accommodate the IC tag 102 in a floating state<br>
in a recessed portion 105a formed in a head 101a of a metal<br>
article 101, the IC tag 102 is secured to the undersurface<br>
of a nonmetal plate 103. The nonmetal plate 103 is fit into<br>
the recessed portion 105a and secured. The head 101a has a<br>
notch 106.<br>
[0005]<br>
With the configuration described above, a magnetic<br>
field generated by the antenna 102b in the IC tag 102 can be<br>
formed into a loop that passes through the notch 106, the<br>
exterior of the metal article 101, and the nonmetal plate<br>
103 and returns to the antenna 102b.<br>
[0006]<br>
A metal article with an IC tag is thus produced.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2003-6599<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
However, the IC tag and the metal article provided with<br>
the IC tag described in Patent Document 1 have the following<br>
problems.<br>
[0008]<br>
(1) Forming a complex structure, including the recessed<br>
portion and the notch, involves a long process and use of<br><br>
additional components. This leads to an increase in cost of<br>
manufacturing the metal article.<br>
[0009]<br>
(2)	Producing the nonmetal plate for covering the<br>
recessed portion involves preparation of material different<br>
from that of the metal article, a long process, and use of<br>
additional material. This leads to an increase in cost of<br>
manufacturing a metal structure. Additionally, application<br>
distortion occurs at a portion where the nonmetal plate is<br>
secured to the metal article, due to a difference in thermal<br>
expansion coefficient. This may cause cracks or fractures.<br>
[0010]<br>
(3)	Forming an antenna pattern is necessary to allow<br>
the IC tag to operate.<br>
[0011]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to<br>
solve the problems described above, reduce cost of<br>
manufacturing a metal article, and provide a wireless IC<br>
device using the metal article as a radiator.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0012]<br>
To solve the problems described above, a wireless IC<br>
device according to the present invention is configured as<br>
follows.<br>
(1) A wireless IC device includes a high-frequency<br><br>
device being an electromagnetically coupled module or a<br>
wireless IC chip, the electromagnetically coupled module<br>
including the wireless IC chip and a feed circuit board<br>
coupled to an external circuit and electrically connected<br>
or electromagnetically coupled to the wireless IC chip; a<br>
radiation electrode acting as a radiator; and a loop<br>
electrode coupled to the high-frequency device and the<br>
radiation electrode, and having a loop plane perpendicular<br>
or inclined to a plane of the radiation electrode.<br>
[0013]<br>
(2)	The loop electrode may be electromagnetically<br>
coupled to the radiation electrode with an insulating laye<br>
interposed therebetween.<br>
[0014]<br>
(3)	The loop electrode may be electrically directly<br>
connected to the radiation electrode, and a part of the<br>
radiation electrode may serve also as the loop electrode.<br>
[0015]<br>
(4)	The wireless IC device may further include a<br>
matching circuit between a mounting area of the high-<br>
frequency device and the loop electrode, the matching<br>
circuit being configured to directly electrically connect<br>
the high-frequency device to the loop electrode.<br>
[0016]<br>
(5)	The wireless IC device may further include a<br><br>
resonant circuit and/or a matching circuit in the feed<br>
circuit board,<br>
[0017]<br>
(6)	A resonance frequency of the resonant circuit may-<br>
be substantially equal to a frequency of a signal<br>
transmitted and received by the radiation electrode.<br>
[0018]<br>
(7)	The high-frequency device or the loop electrode may<br>
be covered with plastic.<br>
[0019]<br>
(8)	The high-frequency device and the loop electrode<br>
may be molded of plastic on the radiation electrode.<br>
[0020]<br>
(9)	The radiation electrode may be a cylindrical metal<br>
article having a conductive layer.<br>
[0021]<br>
(10)	The radiation electrode may be an electrode<br>
pattern formed on a circuit board inside electronic<br>
equipment.<br>
[0022]<br>
(11)	The radiation electrode may be a metal plate<br>
provided in a component inside electronic equipment.<br>
[0023]<br>
(12)	The loop electrode may be disposed on a surface<br>
opposite an electromagnetic wave transmission/reception<br><br>
surface outside the radiation electrode.<br>
[0024]<br>
(13) The loop electrode may be covered with the<br>
radiation electrode or a conductive surface including the<br>
radiation electrode.<br>
Advantages<br>
[0025]<br>
(1) Processing steps and components involved in forming,<br>
in a metal article, a notch, a recessed portion, a plate,<br>
etc., such as those illustrated in Fig. 1, are not necessary.<br>
Thus, there is substantially no cost increase associated<br>
with addition of the wireless IC device to the article.<br>
[0026]<br>
Since all or part of the metal article can be used as a<br>
radiator, it is possible to improve radiation<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0027]<br>
Use of the electromagnetically coupled module allows<br>
design of impedance matching between the wireless IC chip<br>
and the radiation electrode within the feed circuit board.<br>
This increases the degree of design freedom.<br>
[0028]<br>
The amount of coupling between the radiation electrode<br>
and the loop electrode according to the present invention is<br>
largest when the loop electrode is perpendicular to the<br><br>
radiation electrode. However, even if the loop plane of the<br>
loop electrode is inclined to the plane of the radiation<br>
electrode, the radiation electrode and the loop electrode<br>
are coupled to each other while the amount of coupling<br>
therebetween is smaller. Thus, it is possible to provide a<br>
high degree of flexibility in arranging the loop electrode<br>
relative to the radiation electrode.<br>
(2)	When the loop electrode is coupled to the high-<br>
frequency device and electromagnetically coupled to the<br>
radiation electrode with an insulating layer interposed<br>
therebetween, matching between the high-frequency device and<br>
the loop electrode is easily achieved. Additionally, since<br>
the loop electrode and the radiation electrode are<br>
galvanically isolated from each other, high resistance to<br>
static electricity is achieved.<br>
[0030]<br>
(3)	When the loop electrode is coupled to the high-<br>
frequency device and electrically directly connected to the<br>
radiation electrode, and a part of the radiation electrode<br>
serves also as the loop electrode, matching between the<br>
high-frequency device and the loop electrode is easily<br>
achieved. Additionally, since the loop electrode is<br>
strongly coupled to the radiation electrode, it is possible<br>
to provide high gain.<br><br>
[0031]<br>
(4)	When a matching circuit is provided between a<br>
mounting area for mounting the high-frequency device and the<br>
loop electrode, the matching circuit can be used as an<br>
inductor for impedance matching between the radiation<br>
electrode and the high-frequency device. Thus, flexible and<br>
easy design of impedance matching in the wireless IC device<br>
is achieved.<br>
[0032]<br>
(5)	Providing a resonant circuit in the feed circuit<br>
board improves frequency selectivity and allows an. operating<br>
frequency of the wireless IC device to be substantially<br>
determined by the self-resonant frequency. Accordingly,<br>
transmission and reception of energy of signals having a<br>
frequency used in the RFID system can be performed with a<br>
high degree of efficiency. Thus, radiation characteristics<br>
of the wireless IC device can be improved.<br>
[0033]<br>
Also, by providing a matching circuit in the feed<br>
circuit board, transmission and reception of energy of<br>
signals having a frequency used in the RFID system can be<br>
performed with a high degree of efficiency.<br>
[0034]<br>
(6) When a resonance frequency of the resonant circuit<br>
is made substantially equal to a frequency of a signal<br><br>
transmitted and received by the radiation electrode,<br>
transmission and reception of energy of signals having a<br>
frequency used in the RFID system can be performed with a<br>
high degree of efficiency. It is only necessary that the<br>
radiation electrode be simply coupled to the feed circuit<br>
board and have a size appropriate for necessary gain. The<br>
shape and material of the radiation electrode are not<br>
limited by the frequency used, and the radiation electrode<br>
can be used for any types of articles.<br>
[0035]<br>
(7)	When the high-frequency device or the loop<br>
electrode is covered with plastic, the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module can be directly attached to a metal article.<br>
Thus, the degree of design freedom can be increased.<br>
[0036]<br>
(8)	When the high-frequency device and the loop<br>
electrode are molded of plastic on the radiation electrode,<br>
the processing steps of covering the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module and bonding the electromagnetically coupled<br>
module to a metal article can be performed simultaneously.<br>
This makes it possible to reduce the number of processing<br>
steps and manufacturing cost.<br>
[0037]<br>
(9)	When a metal article formed into a cylindrical<br>
shape and having a conductive layer is used as the radiation<br><br>
electrode, the metal article can be used as it is and<br>
substantially the entire metal article acts as a radiator.<br>
Therefore, even if a plurality of articles are stacked on<br>
top of each other, an ID for each article can be read.<br>
[0038]<br>
(10)	When an electrode pattern formed on a circuit<br>
board inside electronic equipment is used as the radiation<br>
electrode, the circuit board inside the electronic equipment<br>
can be used as it is, and mounting of the high-frequency<br>
device becomes easy.<br>
[0039]<br>
(11)	When a metal plate provided in a component, such<br>
as a liquid crystal display panel, inside electronic<br>
equipment is used as the radiation electrode, the component<br>
inside the electronic equipment can be used as it is. Thus,<br>
it is possible to prevent an increase in size and cost.<br>
[0040]<br>
(12)	When the loop electrode is disposed on the surface<br>
opposite the electromagnetic wave transmission/reception<br>
surface outside the radiation electrode, that is, on the<br>
side opposite the surface on which the high-frequency device<br>
is provided, the wireless IC device can be disposed inside<br>
an article. Thus, the wireless IC device is protected by<br>
the radiation electrode and increases its durability.<br>
[0041]<br><br>
(13) When the loop electrode is covered with the<br>
radiation electrode or a conductive surface including the<br>
radiation electrode, the durability and environmental<br>
resistance of the wireless IC device are improved.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0044]<br>
First Embodiment<br>
Fig. 2 is an external perspective view illustrating a<br>
wireless IC device according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention and a metal article provided with the<br>
wireless IC device. A metal article 60 is an article at<br>
least whose surface or near-surface layer is made of metal.<br>
[0045]<br>
A wireless-IC-device main part 6 is provided on a<br>
predetermined surface of the metal article 60. The<br>
component indicated by reference numeral 6 is not referred<br>
to as wireless IC device. This is because the wireless IC<br>
device is constituted not only by the component indicated by<br>
reference numeral 6, but also by a part of the metal surface<br>
of the metal article 60.<br>
[0046]<br><br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of the wireless-IC-device<br>
main part. The wireiess-IC-device main part 6 has an<br>
insulating substrate, which is provided with a loop<br>
electrode 7 and an electromagnetically coupled module 1<br>
coupled to the loop electrode 7. The wireless-IC-device<br>
main part 6 is placed such that a loop plane of the loop<br>
electrode 7 is substantially perpendicular to the metal<br>
article 60.<br>
[0047]<br>
The wireless-IC-device main part 6 having the loop<br>
electrode 7 is bonded to the metal article 60 with an<br>
insulating adhesive or the like.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig. 4 schematically illustrates an example of a<br>
distribution of electromagnetic fields generated on the<br>
metal article 60 when the loop electrode 7 acts as an<br>
auxiliary radiator for transmission. In the drawing, dashed<br>
lines indicate loops of magnetic fields H, while solid lines<br>
indicate loops of electric fields E. The loop electrode 7<br>
acts as an auxiliary radiator for magnetic fields, causes<br>
the magnetic fields H to be generated parallel to the<br>
surface of the metal article 60, and induces the electric<br>
fields E in a direction substantially perpendicular to the<br>
surface of the metal article 60. Then, electric field loops<br>
induce magnetic field loops and thus, this chain of<br><br>
induction events expands the distribution of electromagnetic<br>
fields.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the example described above, the loop electrode 7<br>
acts as an auxiliary radiator for transmission. A high gain<br>
is also obtained when the loop electrode 7 acts as an<br>
auxiliary radiator for reception.<br>
[0050]<br>
The electromagnetically coupled module 1 illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3 includes a wireless IC chip and a feed circuit board<br>
that are described below. The wireless IC chip and the feed<br>
circuit board may either be electrically connected to each<br>
other or electromagnetically coupled to each other. For<br>
electromagnetic coupling, a capacitance is formed of a<br>
dielectric thin film or the like between electrodes of the<br>
wireless IC chip and the feed circuit board. By allowing<br>
the wireless IC chip and the feed circuit board to be<br>
coupled through the capacitance, it is possible to protect<br>
the wireless IC chip from static damage.<br>
[0051]<br>
When the feed circuit board is used, the electrode of<br>
the feed circuit board is electromagnetically coupled to<br>
both ends of the loop electrode 7. Alternatively, the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 may be replaced with a<br>
single wireless IC chip. In both cases, since the loop<br><br>
electrode 7 is galvanically isolated from the metal article<br>
60, the wireless IC device is highly resistant to static<br>
electricity.<br>
[0052]<br>
The loop electrode 7 may be of any shape which allows<br>
coupling between input and output terminals of the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1.<br>
[0053]<br>
Electric fields on a surface of a metal article are<br>
perpendicular to the surface of the metal article.<br>
Therefore, if the loop plane of the loop electrode 7 is<br>
inclined from the position perpendicular to the surface of<br>
the metal article 60, the strength of electric fields<br>
induced by magnetic fields of the loop electrode 7 is<br>
reduced, and thus the antenna gain is reduced. The gain<br>
increases as the loop plane of the loop electrode 7<br>
approaches the position perpendicular to the metal article<br>
60. However, even if the loop plane of the loop electrode 7<br>
is inclined relative to the surface of the metal article 60,<br>
the metal article 60 still acts as a radiator. Therefore,<br>
the loop plane of the loop electrode 7 may be inclined as<br>
necessary.<br>
[0054]<br>
To allow the loop electrode 7 to be positioned<br>
substantially perpendicularly to the metal article 60, a<br><br>
recessed portion for accommodating an end of the feed<br>
circuit board may be formed on the surface of the metal<br>
article 60. In this case, the recessed portion may be<br>
internally provided with an insulating material, such as an<br>
insulating adhesive.<br>
[0055]<br>
In the first embodiment, the loop electrode 7 is<br>
directly bonded to the surface of the metal article 60.<br>
Alternatively, for example, the loop electrode 7 may be<br>
bonded onto a metal foil sheet or metal plate, which may<br>
then be bonded to the metal article 60.<br>
[0056]<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
Fig. 5(A) and Fig. 5(B) illustrate configurations of<br>
two wireless IC devices according to a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In the second embodiment, a matching<br>
circuit is placed between a mounting area of a high-<br>
frequency device and a loop electrode. The matching circuit<br>
allows the high-frequency device and the loop electrode to<br>
be directly electrically connected to each other.<br>
[0057]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5(A), a metal article 70 is an<br>
article at least whose surface or near-surface layer is made<br>
of metal. A loop electrode 73 is positioned such that the<br>
loop plane thereof is substantially perpendicular to the<br><br>
metal article 70. This allows the metal article 70 to act<br>
as a radiator.<br>
[0058]<br>
A wireless-IC-device main part 69 is internally-<br>
provided with a matching circuit 11 including a meander<br>
electrode, and metal ribbons 9a and 9b serving as a mounting<br>
area for mounting a high-frequency device<br>
(electromagnetically coupled module or wireless IC chip).<br>
[0059]<br>
By thus providing the matching circuit 11, the wireless<br>
IC chip can be directly mounted on the metal ribbons 9a and<br>
9b. If the wireless IC chip is directly mounted on the loop<br>
electrode, the operating frequency of the wireless IC device<br>
is substantially determined by the loop electrode including<br>
the matching circuit 11.<br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 5(B) illustrates a state in which the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 is mounted on the metal<br>
ribbons 9a and 9b in the wireless-IC-device main part 69<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5(A) . The configuration of the matching<br>
circuit 11, metal ribbons 9a and 9b serving as a mounting<br>
area of the electromagnetically coupled module, and loop<br>
electrode 73 is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 5(A).<br>
[0061]<br>
With this configuration, the loop electrode 73 acts as<br><br>
an auxiliary radiator for magnetic fields and is coupled to<br>
the metal article 70. Thus, through action similar to that<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4, the metal article 70 acts as a<br>
radiator.<br>
[0062]<br>
The metal article 70 illustrated in Fig. 5(A) and Fig.<br>
5(B) may be, for example, a solid electrode formed on a<br>
circuit board inside a mobile phone terminal.<br>
[0063]<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
Fig. 6 is an external perspective view illustrating a<br>
wireless IC device according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention and a metal article provided with the<br>
wireless IC device. A metal article 61 is an article at<br>
least whose surface or near-surface layer is made of metal.<br>
[0064]<br>
In the example illustrated in Fig. 3, the entire loop<br>
electrode is provided on the substrate of the wireless-IC-<br>
device main part 6. In the example illustrated in Fig. 6,<br>
loop electrode segments 71 that constitute part of the loop<br>
electrode are provided on a substrate of a wireless-IC-<br>
device main part 66. Then, a part of the metal article 61<br>
serves also as a part of the loop electrode.<br>
[0065]<br>
Fig. 7 is an enlarged view of the wireless-IC-device<br><br>
main part 66 illustrated in Fig. 6. The wireless-IC-device<br>
main part 66 has the substrate provided with the loop<br>
electrode segments 71 and 71 and the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module 1 coupled to the loop electrode segments 71<br>
and 71. The configuration of the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module 1 is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
The loop electrode segments 71 and 71 constitute part of the<br>
loop electrode. A part of the surface of the metal article<br>
61 serves also as a part of the loop electrode. In other<br>
words, the loop electrode segments 71 and 71 and the surface<br>
of the metal article 61 constitute the loop electrode, as<br>
indicated by L in the drawing.<br>
[0066]<br>
With this configuration, the loop electrode constituted<br>
by the loop electrode segments 71 and 71 and the surface of<br>
the metal article 61 acts as an auxiliary radiator for<br>
magnetic fields and is coupled to the metal article 61.<br>
Thus, through action similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4,<br>
the surface of the metal article 61 acts as a radiator.<br>
[0067]<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 8 is an external view of a metal article provided<br>
with a wireless IC device according to a fourth embodiment<br>
of the present invention. A metal article 62 is, for<br>
example, a cylindrical metal can. Unlike the polyhedral<br><br>
metal articles illustrated as examples in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6,<br>
tuc metal article 62 illustrated as an example in Fig. 8 has<br>
a cylindrical shape. A wireless-IC-device main part 67 is<br>
attached to the periphery of the metal article 62.<br>
[0068]<br>
Fig. 9 is an enlarged view of a mounting area of the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 67 illustrated in Fig. 8. The<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 67 includes loop electrode<br>
segments 72 and 72 and the electromagnetically coupled<br>
module 1 coupled to the loop electrode segments 72 and 72.<br>
Unlike the loop electrode segments 71 and 71 formed on the<br>
substrate as illustrated in Fig. 7, the loop electrode<br>
segments 72 and 72 illustrated in Fig. 9 are made of metal<br>
plates. The configuration of the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module 1 is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
and Fig. 7.<br>
[0069]<br>
With this configuration, the loop electrode constituted<br>
by the loop electrode segments 72 and 72 and the surface of<br>
the metal article 62 acts as an auxiliary radiator for<br>
magnetic fields and is coupled to the metal article 62.<br>
Thus, through action similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4,<br>
the surface of the metal article 62 acts as a radiator.<br>
[0070]<br>
When many articles are stacked, the above-described<br><br>
chain of induction events that occurs between electric and<br>
magnetic fields also occur among the articles, as long as a<br>
conductive part of each of the article acts as a radiator.<br>
Therefore, even if (or rather, particularly if) many<br>
articles are stacked, the wireless IC device acts as a high-<br>
gain wireless IC device. For example, in a state where an<br>
antenna of a reader/writer is placed close to a stack of<br>
soft drink cans to which the present invention is applied,<br>
IDs for all the soft drink cans in the stack can be read.<br>
[0071]<br>
Even in the case of a paper container, if it includes a<br>
conductive layer of aluminum or the like, the conductive<br>
layer acts as a radiator.<br>
[0072]<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 10 is an external view of a metal article provided<br>
with a wireless IC device according to a fifth embodiment of<br>
the present invention. A metal article 63 is, for example,<br>
a cylindrical metal can. In the example illustrated in Fig.<br>
8, the electromagnetically coupled module 1 is positioned on<br>
the periphery of the metal article 62. In the example<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10, metal ribbons 9 and 9 are provided<br>
in a part of the metal article 63, and the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 is positioned on the<br>
metal ribbons 9 and 9. The electromagnetically coupled<br><br>
module 1 and the metal ribbons 9 and 9 may be covered with<br>
insulating material, such as plastic, or such material may<br>
be molded around the electromagnetically coupled module 1<br>
and the metal ribbons 9 and 9.<br>
[0073]<br>
Fig. 11 is an enlarged view of a mounting area of the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 illustrated in Fig. 10.<br>
As indicated by L in the drawing, a part of the metal<br>
article 63 and the metal ribbons 9 and 9 provided in a part<br>
of the metal article 63 act as a loop electrode.<br>
[0074]<br>
With this configuration, the metal ribbons 9 and 9 and<br>
a part of the metal article 63 act as an auxiliary radiator<br>
for magnetic fields and are coupled to the metal article 63.<br>
Thus, through action similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4,<br>
the metal article 63 acts as a radiator.<br>
[0075]<br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 12 is an external view of a metal article provided<br>
with a wireless IC device according to a sixth embodiment of<br>
the present invention. A metal article 64 is provided with<br>
a wireless-IC-device main part 68 on its surface.<br>
[0076]<br>
Fig. 13 is an enlarged view of the wireless-IC-device<br>
main part 68. The overall shape of the wireless-IC-device<br><br>
main part 68 is a so-called "tack index label" shape. An<br>
insulating sheet 65 internally has adhesive layers, between<br>
which the loop electrode 7 and the electromagnetically<br>
coupled module 1 are interposed. The configuration of the<br>
loop electrode 7 and electromagnetically coupled module 1 is<br>
the same as that illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
[0077]<br>
In a manner as if a tack index label is affixed, the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 68 is mounted on the metal<br>
article 64 such that the loop electrode 7 is perpendicular<br>
to the surface of the metal article 64 illustrated in Fig.<br>
12.<br>
[0078]<br>
With the configuration described above, the loop<br>
electrode 7 acts as an auxiliary radiator for magnetic<br>
fields and is coupled to the metal article 64. Thus,<br>
through action similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4, the<br>
surface of the metal article 64 acts as a radiator.<br>
[0079]<br>
Here, a loop along the metal article acts as the loop<br>
electrode 7. Alternatively, as described in the foregoing<br>
embodiments, the metal article 64 may be configured to act<br>
both as a part of the loop electrode and a radiator.<br>
[0080]<br>
Seventh Embodiment<br><br>
Fig. 14 is an external perspective view of the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 for a wireless IC<br>
device according to a seventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The electromagnetically coupled module 1 is<br>
applicable to the wireless IC device of any of the other<br>
embodiments. The electromagnetically coupled module 1<br>
includes a wireless IC chip 5 and a feed circuit board 4.<br>
The feed circuit board 4 not only provides an impedance<br>
match between the wireless IC chip 5 and a metal article<br>
acting as a radiator, but also acts as a resonant circuit.<br>
[0081]<br>
Fig. 15 is an exploded view illustrating an internal<br>
configuration of the feed circuit board 4. The feed circuit<br>
board 4 is a multilayer substrate formed by stacking a<br>
plurality of dielectric layers each having an electrode<br>
pattern. A dielectric layer 41A at the top has wireless-IC-<br>
chip mounting lands 35a to 35d. A dielectric layer 41B has<br>
a capacitor electrode 51 electrically connected to the<br>
wireless-IC-chip mounting land 35b. A dielectric layer 41C<br>
has a capacitor electrode 53. A capacitor CI is formed<br>
between the capacitor electrode 51 and the capacitor<br>
electrode 53. Dielectric layers 4ID to 41H each have<br>
inductor electrodes 45a and 45b. The inductor electrodes<br>
45a and 45b on a plurality of different layers form<br>
inductors LI and L2 that are double-spiral in overall shape<br><br>
and are strongly dielectrically coupled to each other. The<br>
dielectric layer 4IF has a capacitor electrode 54<br>
electrically connected to the inductor LI. The capacitor<br>
electrode 54 is interposed between the capacitor electrode<br>
53 and a capacitor electrode 55, and forms the capacitor<br>
electrode 55. Electrodes of adjacent dielectric layers are<br>
electrically connected to each other through corresponding<br>
via holes 42a to 42i.<br>
[0082]<br>
Fig. 16 is an equivalent circuit diagram illustrating<br>
the feed circuit board 4 of Fig. 15 and the loop electrode.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, the capacitor CI corresponds to a<br>
capacitance formed between the capacitor electrodes 51 and<br>
53 illustrated in Fig. 15; the capacitor C2 corresponds to a<br>
capacitance formed between the capacitor electrodes 54 and<br>
53 and the capacitor electrode 55 illustrated in Fig. 15;<br>
and the inductors LI and L2 correspond to the inductor<br>
electrodes 45a and 45b illustrated in Fig. 15.<br>
[0083]<br>
The capacitor electrode 55 is parallel to and opposite<br>
an end of the loop electrode (i.e., the loop electrode 7 in<br>
the example of Fig. 3) . The capacitor electrode 55 forms a<br>
capacitance between itself and this end of the loop<br>
electrode 7. The inductor electrodes LI and L2 are<br>
electromagnetically coupled to the other end of the loop<br><br>
electrode 7.<br>
[0084]<br>
In the feed circuit board 4, a resonance frequency is<br>
determined by a resonant circuit formed by the inductance<br>
elements LI and L2 and their stray capacitance. The<br>
frequency of a signal emitted from a radiation electrode is<br>
substantially determined by the self-resonant frequency of<br>
the resonant circuit.<br>
[0085]<br>
The electromagnetically coupled module 1 formed by<br>
mounting the wireless IC chip 5 on the feed circuit board 4<br>
receives, through the radiation electrode, high-frequency<br>
signals (e.g., in the UHF frequency band) emitted from a<br>
reader/writer (not shown), causes the resonant circuit in<br>
the feed circuit board 4 to resonate, and supplies received<br>
signals only in a predetermined frequency band to the<br>
wireless IC chip 5. At the same time, the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 extracts predetermined<br>
energy from the received signals, uses the extracted energy<br>
as a drive source to match information stored in the<br>
wireless IC chip 5 to a predetermined frequency in the<br>
resonant circuit, and transmits the information to the<br>
radiation electrode, from which the information is<br>
transmitted (transferred) to the reader/writer.<br>
[0086]<br><br>
Thus, providing a resonant circuit in the feed circuit<br>
board improves frequency selectivity and allows an operating<br>
frequency of the wireless IC device to be substantially<br>
determined by the self-resonant frequency. Accordingly,<br>
transmission and reception of energy of signals having a<br>
frequency used in the RFID system can be performed with a<br>
high degree of efficiency. At the same time, it is possible<br>
to set an optimum resonance frequency for the shape and size<br>
of the radiator, and thus to improve the radiation<br>
characteristics of the wireless IC device.<br>
[0087]<br>
Eighth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates a configuration of an<br>
electromagnetically coupled module for a wireless IC device<br>
according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, a loop electrode 3 0 is formed on an<br>
inner layer of a base 10. An insulating layer is disposed<br>
over two open ends 30a and 3 0b of the loop electrode 30, and<br>
an inductor electrode 20 and a capacitor electrode 25 are<br>
disposed over the insulating layer. The inductor electrode<br>
2 0 has a spiral shape and its inner end is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 2 5 as described below.<br>
[0088]<br>
As illustrated in an enlarged view in Fig. 17, the<br>
wireless IC chip 5 is mounted on the ends of the inductor<br><br>
electrode 20 and capacitor electrode 25. Specifically, the<br>
wireless-IC-chip mounting land 35a is formed at the end of<br>
the inductor electrode 20, the wireless-IC-chip mounting<br>
land 3 5b is formed at the end of the capacitor electrode 25,<br>
and the wireless-IC-chip mounting lands 3 5c and 3 5d are<br>
formed additionally. Then, the wireless IC chip 5 is<br>
mounted on the wireless-IC-chip mounting lands 35a to 35d.<br>
[0089]<br>
Fig. 18 is a cross-sectional view taken along line II-<br>
II of Fig. 17. Referring to Fig. 18, a wire 21 connects the<br>
inductor electrode 20 and the capacitor electrode 25.<br>
[0090]<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 19, as a modification of the<br>
eighth embodiment, the wireless IC chip 5 and the loop<br>
electrode 3 0 may be electrically connected through impedance<br>
matching units 8 and 8.<br>
[0091]<br>
The impedance matching units 8 and 8 may be separately<br>
produced using a ceramic multilayer substrate, a glass epoxy<br>
substrate, or the like and attached to the loop electrode 3 0<br>
by a conductive adhesive. Thus, the impedance matching<br>
units 8 and 8 allow electrical connection between the<br>
wireless IC chip 5 and the loop electrode 30.<br>
[0092]<br>
Ninth Embodiment<br><br>
Fig. 20 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a<br>
feed circuit board 4 0 in a wireless IC device according to a<br>
ninth embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 21 is an<br>
equivalent circuit diagram of Fig. 20.<br>
[0093]<br>
The feed circuit board 4 0 is a multilayer substrate<br>
formed by stacking a plurality of dielectric layers each<br>
having an electrode pattern. The dielectric layer 41A at<br>
the top has the wireless-IC-chip mounting lands 35a to 35d.<br>
The dielectric layer 41B has the capacitor electrode 51<br>
electrically connected to the wireless-IC-chip mounting land<br>
35b. The dielectric layer 41C has the capacitor electrode<br>
53. The capacitor CI is formed between the capacitor<br>
electrode 51 and the capacitor electrode 53. The dielectric<br>
layers 4ID to 41H each have the inductor electrodes 4 5a and<br>
45b. The inductor electrodes 45a and 45b form the inductor<br>
LI that is double-spiral in overall shape.<br>
[0094]<br>
The dielectric layer 41F has the capacitor electrode 54<br>
electrically connected to the inductor LI. The capacitor<br>
electrode 54 is interposed between the capacitor electrodes<br>
53 and 55 (56) , and forms a capacitor. The dielectric layer<br>
41H has the capacitor electrode 55 electrically connected to<br>
the capacitor electrode 53.<br>
[0095]<br><br>
Dielectric layers 41J to 41N each have inductor<br>
electrodes 46 and 47. The inductor electrodes 46 and 47<br>
form the loop electrode L2 winding multiple times.<br>
Electrodes of adjacent dielectric layers are electrically<br>
connected to each other through corresponding via holes 4 2a<br>
to 42m.<br>
[0096]<br>
That is, the feed circuit board 40 is obtained by<br>
adding a loop electrode to the feed circuit board 4<br>
illustrated in Fig. 15.<br>
[0097]<br>
Referring to Fig. 21, the capacitor C1 corresponds to a<br>
capacitance formed between the capacitor electrodes 51 and<br>
53 illustrated in Fig. 2 0; the capacitor C2 corresponds to a<br>
capacitance formed between the capacitor electrodes 54 and<br>
53 and the capacitor electrode 55 illustrated in Fig. 20;<br>
inductors Lla and Lib correspond to the inductor electrodes<br>
45a and 45b illustrated in Fig. 20; and the inductor L2<br>
corresponds to the inductor electrodes 46 and 47 illustrated<br>
in Fig. 20.<br>
[0098]<br>
Tenth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 22 is an external perspective view of a notebook<br>
personal computer provided with a wireless IC device. Fig.<br>
23 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main part of a<br><br>
circuit board inside the notebook personal computer.<br>
Electronic components 17 and 18 and the wireless-IC-device<br>
main part 6 are mounted on a circuit board 15 inside the<br>
notebook personal computer in a direction substantially-<br>
perpendicular to the circuit board 15. An electrode pattern<br>
16 is formed on an upper surface of the circuit board 15.<br>
The electrode pattern 16 is coupled to the wireless-IC-<br>
device main part 6 and acts as a radiator.<br>
[0099]<br>
As another example, a wireless IC device may be formed<br>
on a metal panel on the back of a component (e.g., liquid<br>
crystal panel) inside the notebook personal computer<br>
illustrated in Fig. 22. That is, the wireless IC device<br>
according to any of the first to tenth embodiments may be<br>
applied to cause the metal panel to act as a radiator.<br>
[0100]<br>
The same is applicable to any metal articles (e.g., a<br>
safe and a container) in addition to those described in the<br>
foregoing embodiments.<br>
[0101]<br>
Eleventh Embodiment<br>
Fig. 24 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main<br>
part of a wireless IC device according to an eleventh<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the example described in the first embodiment with<br><br>
reference to Fig. 2, the wireless-IC-device main part 6 is<br>
mounted, on the surface (i.e. , electromagnetic wave<br>
transmission/reception surface outside the metal article 60)<br>
for receiving signals from the reader/writer. In the<br>
eleventh embodiment, the wireless-IC-device main part 6 is<br>
mounted on a surface opposite the surface for receiving<br>
signals from the reader/writer.<br>
[0102]<br>
As in the case of the first embodiment, the wireless-<br>
IC-device main part 6 has an insulating substrate, which is<br>
provided with the loop electrode 7 and the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 coupled to the loop<br>
electrode 7.<br>
[0103]<br>
With this configuration, a signal (magnetic field Ho)<br>
from the reader/writer causes an eddy current J to flow<br>
across the conductor principal plane of the metal article 60.<br>
The eddy current J causes a magnetic field Hi to be<br>
generated in a direction perpendicular to the conductor<br>
principal plane of the metal article 60. Then, the loop<br>
electrode 7 is coupled to the magnetic field Hi. Thus, the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 6 functions as an RFID tag even<br>
for signals from the principal plane opposite the wireless-<br>
IC-device main part 6.<br>
[0104]<br><br>
An article on which the wireless-IC-device main part 6<br>
is mounted is not limited to a metal article, but may be a.ny<br>
article having a surface made of conductive material, such<br>
as carbon.<br>
The loop electrode 7 may either be in contact with or<br>
separated from the conductive surface of the article.<br>
[0105]<br>
Twelfth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 25(A) to Fig. 25(C) are cross-sectional views<br>
illustrating a main part of a wireless IC device according<br>
to a twelfth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the example described in the first embodiment with<br>
reference to Fig. 2, the wireless-IC-device main part 6 is<br>
mounted on the surface (i.e., outer surface) of the metal<br>
article 60. However, in the twelfth embodiment, the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 6 is mounted inside (i.e., on<br>
the inner surface) of the metal article 60.<br>
[0106]<br>
Fig. 25(A) illustrates metal cases (half cases) 81 and<br>
82 having joining parts protruding inside the cases. Fig.<br>
25(B) illustrates the metal cases (half cases) 81 and 82<br>
having joining parts protruding outside the cases. Fig.<br>
25(C) illustrates the metal cases (half cases) 81 and 82<br>
having a hinge mechanism for maintaining conductivity at one<br>
end. In every case, corresponding joining parts are joined<br><br>
to each other with an electrical insulator (e.g., rubber<br>
packing) or an electrical resistor interposed therebetween.<br>
[0107]<br>
As in the case of the first embodiment, the wireless-<br>
IC-device main part 6 has an insulating substrate, which is<br>
provided with the loop electrode 7 and the<br>
electromagnetically coupled module 1 coupled to the loop<br>
electrode 7.<br>
[0108]<br>
With this configuration, as in the case of the eleventh<br>
embodiment, a signal (magnetic field) from the reader/writer<br>
causes an eddy current to flow across the conductor<br>
principal plane of the metal cases 81 and 82. The eddy<br>
current causes a magnetic field to be generated in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the conductor principal plane of<br>
the metal cases 81 and 82. Then, the magnetic field is<br>
coupled to the loop electrode 7. This allows the metal<br>
cases 81 and 82 to be used as metal articles having an<br>
internal RFID tag.<br>
[0109]<br>
In the examples illustrated in Fig. 25(A) and Fig.<br>
25 (B) , the upper metal, case 82 is galvanically isolated from<br>
the metal case 81 in which the wireless-IC-device main part<br>
6 is provided. However, since a chain of electric field<br>
loops and magnetic field loops spreads along the conductor<br><br>
plane of the metal cases, the upper metal case 82 also acts<br>
as a radiator.<br>
[0110]<br>
Thus, by providing the wireless IC device 6 inside a<br>
case, the durability and environmental resistance of the<br>
wireless IC device are improved.<br>
[0111]<br>
The same applies to the situation where the wireless-<br>
IC-device main part 6 illustrated in Fig. 25(A) to Fig.<br>
25(C) is, for example, an RFID tag for a food product and<br>
the metal cases 81 and 82 correspond to a housing of a<br>
refrigerator or freezer. Here, it is possible to externally<br>
read information about each food product without opening the<br>
door of the refrigerator or freezer.<br>
[0112]<br>
The same also applies to the situation where the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 6 illustrated in Fig. 25(A) to<br>
Fig. 25(C) is, for example, an RFID tag for an electronic<br>
component or circuit board and the metal cases 81 and 82<br>
correspond to a housing of a personal computer or mobile<br>
phone terminal. Here, it is possible to externally read<br>
information about each electronic component or circuit board<br>
without opening the housing of the personal computer or<br>
mobile phone terminal.<br>
[0113]<br><br>
Although Fig. 25(A) to Fig. 25(C) illustrate can-shaped<br>
metal cases as examples, the same also applies to tubular or<br>
cup-shaped conductive cases. For example, by providing the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 6 inside a carbon shaft of a<br>
golf club, the golf club can be used as a golf club having<br>
an internal RFID tag that is externally readable and<br>
writable.<br>
[0114]<br>
Thirteenth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 26 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main<br>
part of a wireless IC device according to a thirteenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the example of Fig. 26, metal cases 83 and 84 that<br>
are surface-coated with electrical insulating material or<br>
electrical resistive material are used. The other<br>
configuration is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 25(A)<br>
to Fig. 25(C).<br>
[0115]<br>
Thus, an interface between the upper and lower cases<br>
may be insulated or substantially insulated by the coating<br>
over the case surface.<br>
[0116]<br>
Fourteenth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 27 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main<br>
part of a wireless IC device according to a fourteenth<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the exa.mple of Fig = 27, protrusions 94 at joining<br>
parts between a lower metal case 8 5 and an upper metal case<br>
86 create a clearance 95. The other configuration is the<br>
same as that illustrated in Fig. 25(A) to Fig. 25(C).<br>
[0117]<br>
Thus, even if there is a clearance in metal cases, the<br>
metal article can be used as an article having an internal<br>
RFID tag, through action similar to that described above.<br>
[0118]<br>
Fifteenth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 28 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main<br>
part of a wireless IC device according to a fifteenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the example of Fig. 28, the wireless-IC-device main<br>
part 6 is mounted inside a metal tray 87 to form a metal<br>
tray having an RFID tag. The metal tray 87 is surface-<br>
coated with electrical insulating material or electrical<br>
resistive material. In the example of Fig. 28, a plurality<br>
of metal trays are stacked on top of each other.<br>
[0119]<br>
By stacking the metal trays as described above, the<br>
metal trays are galvanically isolated from each other by the<br>
coating of the electrical insulating material or electrical<br>
resistive material, and each wireless-IC-device main part 6<br><br>
is surrounded by metal material. However, as in the cases<br>
of the twelfth to fourteenth embodiments described above,<br>
the reader/writer can communicate with an RFID tag in each<br>
metal tray.<br>
[0120]<br>
Sixteenth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 29 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a main<br>
part of a wireless IC device accordincr to a sixteenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the example of Fig. 29, the wireless-IC-device main<br>
part 6 is mounted inside a metal tray 88 to form a metal<br>
tray having an RFID tag. The metal tray 8 8 has a rim 96 of<br>
electrical insulating material or electrical resistive<br>
material at its edge. In the example of Fig. 29, a<br>
plurality of metal trays are stacked on top of each other.<br>
[0121]<br>
By stacking the metal trays as described above, the<br>
metal trays are galvanically isolated from each other by the<br>
electrical insulating material or electrical resistive<br>
material, and each wireless-IC-device main part 6 is<br>
surrounded by metal material. However, as in the cases of<br>
the twelfth to fourteenth embodiments described above, the<br>
reader/writer can individually communicate with an RFID tag<br>
in each metal tray.<br>
[0122]<br><br>
In the examples described with reference to Fig. 2 5 to<br>
Fig. 29, there are portions galvanically isolated by the<br>
electrical insulating or resistive material. However, the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part 6 provided inside a case or<br>
housing tightly surrounded by conductive material can still<br>
be used as an RFID tag while the antenna gain may be<br>
slightly reduced.<br>
[0123]<br>
A loop electrode of rectangular shape is used in the<br>
embodiments described above. However, the loop electrode<br>
may be of any shape, such as circular, elliptical, or<br>
polygonal shape, depending on the article in which the<br>
electrode is contained. Additionally, the loop electrode<br>
may extend from the bottom to the side of a case. Even when<br>
the shape of the signal transmission/reception surface is<br>
thus modified, the wireless-IC-device main part 6 still<br>
functions as an RFID tag.<br>
[0124]<br>
Also, in the embodiments described above, a loop<br>
electrode is formed of a single-layer conductive pattern.<br>
However, the loop electrode may have a multilayer coil<br>
structure, instead of a single-layer loop structure.<br>
[0125]<br>
A loop electrode forms an open loop in the embodiments<br>
described above. However, the loop electrode may form a<br><br>
closed loop, as long as the loop electrode is configured to<br>
be magnetically coupled to an inductor in a feed circuit<br>
board. That is, an inductor pattern parallel to the loop<br>
plane of the loop electrode may be formed on the feed<br>
circuit board such that the inductor pattern is magnetically<br>
coupled to the loop electrode forming a closed loop.<br>
[0126]<br>
Also, in the embodiments described above, a wireless-<br>
IC-device main part having a loop electrode is in contact<br>
with a predetermined surface of a case. However, the<br>
wireless-IC-device main part may be spaced from the<br>
predetermined surface, or may be hung from the inner surface<br>
of the case (i.e., suspended in the air inside the case).<br>
[0127]<br>
Also, in the embodiments described above, a wireless-<br>
IC-device main part having a loop electrode is mounted on a<br>
principal surface of a case, the principal surface having a<br>
large area. However, the wireless-IC-device main part may<br>
be mounted on a side of the case.<br><br>
