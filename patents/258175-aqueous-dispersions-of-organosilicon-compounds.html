Aqueous dispersions of organosllicona compounds<br>
The invention relates to aqueous dispersions of organosllicona compounds, the preparation thereof and the use thereof, in particular for the hydrophobing impregnation and mass hydrophotaing of mineral and organic building materials.<br>
Silanes and slogans have long been used for the production of structures, for example solutions of silanes in organic solvents, as described, for example, in DE-A 1069057. For cost reasons, but rot least also because of the health hazards, during handling of organic solvents and the associated environmental pollution, working with organic solvents is disadvantageous.<br>
Aqueous formulations based on alkylalkoxysilanes and -slogans are known. EP-A 234 024 describes silanes emulsions comprising nonionic emulsifiers, which have an HLB value of from 4 to 15. According to EP-A. 340 816 the stability of these compositions is improved by the addition of buffer salts. EP-A 631 999 describes aqueous formulations based on alkylalkoxysilanes, which contain cationic emulsifiers. According to WO-A 199516752 and EP-A 907 622, amine soaps are said to be suitable in particular for the preparation of silane/siloxane emulsions. WO-A 199522580 describes a series of further cationic emulsifiers in silane/siloxane emulsions. According to EP-A 1 147 072, the stability of silane/siloxane emulsions is particularly good when ionic emulsifiers are used in combination with nonionogenic emulsifiers which have an HLB value of less than 11.<br>
Nevertheless, the aqueous structure preservatives prepared according to the prior art do not always have the desired stability and efficiency.<br><br>

The dispersions according to the invention have the advantage that they develop a very good and stable impregnating effect and very good .penetration behavior on different substrates .<br>
The aqueous dispersions according to the invention can be used for all purposes for which dispersions based on organosilicon compounds have also been used to date. They are, for example, outstandingly suitable as preservatives for structures, in particular for hydrophobing various mineral or organic substrates. The manner in which such dispersions are used is known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the treatment of substrates, wherein the substrates are brought into contact with the dispersions according to the invention.<br>
Examples of substrates which can be treated with the dispersions according to the invention are mineral substances, such as masonry, mortar, brick, limestone, marble, sand-lime brick, sandstone, granite, porphyry, concrete and cellular<br>
22<br><br>
concrete, and :)rcan;.c substances, such as wood, paper, board, textiles and mannade and natzural fibers .<br>
In the process according to the invention, the dispersions generally penetrate into the capillaries of the substrate and dry there.<br>
In the process according to the invention, mineral substrates and wood-base materials are preferably used.<br>
The treatment according to the invention preferably comprises impregnation, coating, priming and injection, particularly preferably impregnation, in particular the substrate being brought into contact with the dispersion and the dispersion penetrating partly or completely into the substrate.<br>
The impregncition accordi.ng to the invention preferably comprises hydrophobing impregnation and can be effected both as impregnation of the surface and as injection or as mass hydrophobing.<br>
The water absorption of the substrate is drastically reduced by the hydrophobing according to the invention, which reduces the thermal conductivity but also prevents the destruction of the building materials by the influence of freezing and thawing cycles or salt or, in the case of wood-based materials, by rotting or fungal attack. Thus, not only is the value of the material thus treated preserved but, for example, lower energy consumption for heating and air conditioning is also ensured.<br>
For the imprecnatior. applications according to the invention, the dispersions according to the invention are added to the surface of the sukstrate by customary distribution methods known to date, such as, for example, by brushing, spraying,<br>
23<br><br>
knife coating, rolling, pouring, spreading with a trowel, immersion and roll coati.ng. For masonry treatment, it is necessary for the preparations to penetrate far into the masonry. Low-visccsaty dispersions are therefore preferred for the masonry treatment The property of penetrating into the masonry may be be  meterial property or the penetration is artificially pron.cted by transporting the dispersions into the masoni-y with elevated pi'essure.<br>
The dispersions according to the invention can also be used in combinations with organic dispersions and pigments for formulating coating materials, in order to impart hydrophobic properties to these coating materials. This application can also be effected in combination with fluoroorganic polymer dispersions, for example if an oil- and dirt-repellent effect is also desired in  addit:ion to water-repellent effect, for example to prevent damage to the structure by graffiti.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the dispersion according to the invention can be applied in concentrated form or in a forra dilated with water, depending on substrate and the intended effect. If the application according to the invention is effected in dilute form, the content of component (A) in the dispersion used is then preferably from 2 to 3 5% by weight, in particular from 5 to 20% by weight.<br>
The process for the treatment of substrates has the advantage that it is efficient and economical and that the substrates are protected in the long term from the influence of water.<br>
In the follov;i:.ig examples, all data relating to parts and percentages are based on weight, unless stated otherwise. Unless s-ated otherwise, the following examples are carried out at a pressure of the ambient atmosphere, i.e. at about<br>
24<br><br>
1000 hPa, and at: rcom temperature, i.e. about 20°C,, or a temperature which is established on combining the reactants at room temperature withoat. additional heating or cooling.<br>

Exeunple 5<br>
The dispersions according to the invention are used for impregnating munstar disks. For the production of the mortar disks, 2700 g of standard sand (available from Normensand GmbH, 592 69 Beckurn near Munster, Germany) , 9 00 g of white cement PZ 450 Z (available from Dyckerhoff Zementwerke AG, D-65203 Wiesbaden, Germany) and 4 50 g of tapwater were mixed. The<br>
29<br><br>
mixture is \'J.:\e:.:\  pcured into plastic rings (diameter 8.5 cm, height 2 cm), which are present on a plastic film. For compaction and removal C)f a;-r inclusions, a spatula is inserted frequcently iat:) the material and the supernatant of the concrete mix is ther, removed using the spatula. The samples are covered with a film and cleaned at the edges. The test specimens must be stored for at least 3 months under standard climatic conditions (23C, 50% relative humidity) before being used. Immediately before use, the top of the samples is sandblasted for removing the sintered cement layer.<br>
Prior to impregnation, the nortar disks thus obtained are immersed for 2 minutes in demineralized water and, after packing in film, are stored for 12 hours at room temperature. Thereafter, thay are stored without packing for 2 hours under standard clime.tic conditions (23/50) and are impregnated after determining the initial weight (Wl). This is done by a procedure in wnich the test specimens are immersed for 1 minute in the respective dispersion according to the invention (excess liquid level about 5 cm). The dispersions according to examples 1 and 2 are used in concentrated form and the dispersions according to examples 3 and 4 diluted in weight ratio 1:4 with water for the impregnation. Weighing (W2) is now effected again, and the absorption of impregnating agent is determ.ined from the difference (W2 - Wl).<br>
For development of the hydrophobic effect, the samples are stored for 14 3ays under standard climatic conditions (23/50). The test specimens are now weighed again (W5) and placed for 24 hours in demineralized water (excess water level 5 cm) . The water absorption is determined by weighings (W6). The percentage water absorption is calculated according to (W6 -W5)/W5 X 100, The results and a blind test without dispersion<br>
