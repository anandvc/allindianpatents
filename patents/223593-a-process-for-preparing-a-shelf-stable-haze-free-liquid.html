RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/861,393, filed on May 1 8, 2001. The entire disclosure of that application is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to powdered overbased amorphous alkaline earth metal salts of fatty acids and a process for producing them. The overbased powders are useful in many applications including polymer stabilizers, lubricants, catalysts, oil well compositions, animal nutrition and cosmetics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preparation of overbased calcium or barium salts of carboxylic acids, alkyl phenols, and sulfonic acids are disclosed in the following U. S. Patents: 2,61 6,904; 2,760,970; 2,767,1 64; 2,798,852; 2,802,81 6; 3,027,325; 3,031,284; 3,342,733; 3,533,975; 3,773,664;<br><br>
and 3,779,922. The use of these overbased metal salts in the halogencontaining<br>
organic polymer is described in the following U S. Patents:<br>
4,159,973; 4,252,698; and 3,194,823. The use of overbased barium<br>
salt in stabilizer formulations has increased during recent years. This is<br>
due, in the main, to the fact that overbased barium salts possess<br>
performance advantages over the neutral barium salts. The performance<br>
advantages associated with overbased barium salts are low plate-out,<br>
excellent color hold, good long-term heat stability performance, good<br>
compatibility with the stabilizer components, etc. Unfortunately, most<br>
of the overbased barium salts are dark in color and, while these dark<br>
colored overbased barium salts are effective stabilizers for halogencontaining<br>
organic polymer, their dark color results in the discoloration of<br>
the end product. This feature essentially prohibits the use of dark colored<br>
overbased barium salts in applications where a light colored polymer<br>
product is desired.<br>
According to the teachings of U. S. Patent No. 4,665,117,<br>
light colored alkali or alkaline earth metal salts are prepared where alkyl<br>
phenol is used as a promoter. However, alkyl phenol is also a major<br>
cause for the development of color in the final product. This problem is<br>
overcome by the use of propylene oxide which displaces the hydrogen of<br>
the phenolic hydroxyl group and thereby restricts the formation of colored<br>
species. However, there are disadvantages associated with this<br>
approach, principally due to the toxic nature of propylene oxide.<br>
Propylene oxide is classified as a possible carcinogen and laboratory<br>
animal inhalation studies have shown evidence of a link to cancer.<br>
Propylene oxide is also listed as a severe eye irritant, and prolonged<br>
exposure to propylene oxide vapors may result in permanent damage to<br>
the eye. Furthermore, propylene oxide is extremely flammable and<br>
explosive in nature under certain conditions. Propylene oxide boils at<br>
94°F and flashes at -20°F. As a result, extreme precautions are required<br>
to handle propylene oxide at the plant site. Special storage equipment is<br>
required for propylene oxide and other safety features are necessary.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,665,117 describes the use of propylene oxide at<br>
150°C. At this temperature, propylene oxide will be in the gaseous<br>
phase. Under these operating conditions, more than stoichiometric<br>
amounts of propylene oxide are required to carry the reaction to<br>
completion because propylene oxide will escape from the reaction mixture<br>
and this requires additional handling of the excess propylene oxide.<br>
With the movement in the plastics industry to remove heavy<br>
metals, liquid calcium-zinc stabilizers are desirous, but not practical, as<br>
replacements for barium-cadmium or barium-zinc. Low metal<br>
concentrations, poor compatibility, haziness in clear products and plate<br>
out during processing in PVC have severely limited the universal<br>
acceptance of calcium based liquid stabilizer compositions. Problems are<br>
encountered in the stability of these compositions upon standing or<br>
storage. Storage stability is due to the incompatibility among the metal<br>
salts employed in the composition and is exhibited by increased turbidity,<br>
viscosity, or insoluble solids over time. As a result, the liquid calcium<br>
compositions are no longer homogeneous or readily pourable and must be<br>
specially treated in order to be used. U. S. Patent No. 5,322,872 is<br>
directed to stabilized compositions of mixed metal carboxylates having<br>
improved storage stability. According to this patent, a complexing agent<br>
is added to the mixed metal carboxylate in order to improve shelf<br>
stability. Complexing agents disclosed in this patent include phosphines,<br>
phosphites, aromatic cyanides, aromatic hydroxy compounds, oximes and<br>
other compounds. U.S. Patents Nos. 5,830,935 and 5,859,267 have<br>
also issued as directed to processes for improving basic metal salts and<br>
stabilizing halogen-containing polymers therewith.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 3,766,066 ('066) and 3,766,067 ('067)<br>
disclose the preparation of solid calcium-containing micellar complexes<br>
from homogenized carbonated calcium overbased organic acid salts with<br>
the aid of " conversion agents" such as water and alcohols. The '067<br>
patent teaches that to prepare the desired micellar complexes from the<br>
overbased salts it is first necessary to subject a solution of those salts in<br>
inert organic liquid diluents to a homogenization step with vigorous<br>
agitation in the presence of water, alcohols or mixtures of alcohols and<br>
water. The homogenization is accompanied by a "thickening" or<br>
"gelling" phenomenon to produce crystalline particles characterized by<br>
an x-ray diffraction pattern corresponding to that of calcite. However,<br>
x-ray diffraction studies of the starting salt solutions do not indicate the<br>
presence of any crystalline calcium carbonate. In fact, the '066 patent<br>
teaches that the calcium carbonate present in the starting nonhomogenized<br>
solution appears to be amorphous. The amorphous metal<br>
salts or complexes present in the material are unquestionably transformed<br>
to crystalline particles on homogenization according to the '066 and<br>
'067 patents. U.S. Patent No, 5,534,169 also teaches the conversion<br>
of a Newtonian overbased calcium carboxylate to a non-Newtonian<br>
dispersion of calcite particles in order to produce a material useful for<br>
reducing friction. U.S. Patent No. 5,830,832 also discloses the<br>
preparation of powdered calcium overbased soaps from branched<br>
oxo-acids.<br>
Notwithstanding the state of the art as exemplified by the<br>
above patents, there is a need for further improvements in overbased<br>
alkaline earth metal salts of fatty acids, methods for making them and<br>
their use in product applications.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention relates to a powdered overbased<br>
amorphous alkaline earth metal salt of a fatty acid. These powders<br>
comprise isolated solid agglomerated particles of an amorphous alkaline<br>
earth metal salt from the group consisting of carbonate, sulfate, sulfide<br>
and sulfite complexed with an amorphous alkaline earth metal carboxylate<br>
of a fatty acid. In a preferred form, the powders are alkaline earth metal<br>
carboxylates/carbonates. These powders are referred to sometimes<br>
hereinafter more simply as "powdered overbased amorphous alkaline<br>
earth metal salt(s)" or "powdered overbased amorphous alkaline earth<br>
metal carboxylate(s)/carbonate(s}". Powdered overbased amorphous<br>
calcium and barium salts are preferably provided and, in a preferred form<br>
of the invention, the powders are essentially free of a phenol or a<br>
phenolic derivative. The powdered amorphous overbased salts are<br>
essentially solid particles which are agglomerated micelles of the<br>
amorphous metal salt, like the metal carbonate, complexed with the<br>
amorphous metal carboxylate. The agglomerated particles generally<br>
range from about 50 microns in size.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing the<br>
powdered overbased amorphous alkaline earth metal salts. The process<br>
involves reacting an alkaline earth metal base and a fatty acid with an<br>
equivalent ratio of metal base to fatty acid being greater than 1:1 in the<br>
presence of a liquid hydrocarbon. A surfactant and catalyst are used to<br>
promote the reaction. The mixture is acidified, preferably by carbonation,<br>
to produce an amorphous alkaline earth metal carbonate. In a preferred<br>
method, during carbonation, a dispersion of alkaline earth metal base, a<br>
liquid hydrocarbon, and an aliphatic alcohol having at least 8 carbon<br>
atoms, is added in relative amounts to produce a stable haze free liquid<br>
reaction product. Water is removed from the reaction product to obtain<br>
a shelf stable haze free liquid overbased alkaline earth metal salt. The<br>
powdered overbased amorphous salt is then isolated by adding a<br>
sufficient amount of solvent for the liquid hydrocarbon/alcohol of the haze<br>
free liquid to cause particles of the overbased amorphous salt to<br>
agglomerate and separate. The agglomerated particles are then isolated<br>
by filtration and drying to a state that particles are handleable as a solid<br>
powder.<br>
As reported in our earlier application Serial No. 09/861,393,<br>
filed on May 18, 2001, it has been found important during carbonation<br>
to add the dispersion of metal base, liquid hydrocarbon and aliphatic<br>
alcohol in relative amounts at a controlled rate to produce the stable haze<br>
free liquid reaction product. There are a number of reasons which are<br>
believed to contribute to the formation of a stable haze free liquid which<br>
is then filterable to remove impurities and byproducts of the reaction. Up<br>
to the discoveries made in accordance with the principles of this<br>
invention, it was not considered possible to make in a practical or<br>
commercial operation an overbased calcium fatty acid salt, for example,<br>
that may be filtered at commercial or practical rates to remove unwanted<br>
impurities and byproducts of the reaction to produce a shelf stable haze<br>
free liquid, in contrast, it has been found that by the continuous addition<br>
of the dispersion or slurry of base during carbonation, such results are<br>
achievable. It is believed that the metal base slurry prevents the<br>
formation of undesirable calcium carbonate crystals or byproducts in the<br>
desired overbased metal salt. These undesirable moieties prevent the<br>
formation of stable haze free products which are filterable. In other<br>
words, the metal base slurry is added at a controlled rate which does not<br>
exceed the rate of the desired product-forming reaction. The reaction is<br>
controlled by continuous or incremental addition of the metal base to<br>
make the calcium ions immediately available for the desired reaction as<br>
opposed to allowing the metal base, for example lime, to react and form<br>
a byproduct. Excessive byproduct or lime coated with calcium carbonate<br>
is believed to render the liquid product unalterable. Using this procedure,<br>
the pH is controlled during the reaction so that the fatty acid is<br>
neutralized and the pH rises to about 10-12 with the continued addition<br>
of base to produce dissolved metal ion which reacts with C02 during<br>
carbonation to produce the desired product. It is believed if the reaction<br>
rate is not controlled, and the base is not dissolved, then solid base<br>
reacts or is coated with calcium carbonate to form undesirable<br>
byproducts. The formation of undesirable byproducts of the reaction<br>
renders the final product unstable and unalterable.<br>
It has now been found that powdered overbased amorphous<br>
salts may be produced from the haze free liquids of the overbased alkaline<br>
earth metal fatty acid salts. These powders are suitable for use in many<br>
products, including lubricants, catalysts, oil well compositions, animal<br>
nutrition and cosmetics. They are particularly useful in making mixed<br>
metal stabilizer compositions with zinc, cadmium or alkyltin carboxylates.<br>
where the metal component can also be barium, calcium, strontium, lead,<br>
bismuth or antimony, and mixtures thereof. The mixed metal stabilizer<br>
compositions provide heat and/or light stability to vinyl halide resins such<br>
as polyvinyt chloride (PVC), and the like.<br>
A number of benefits are obtained by the powdered products<br>
and processes of this invention. The powders provide shelf stable<br>
overbased alkaline earth metal fatty acid salts. In particular, shelf<br>
stabilities are achieved with the powders being free of phenol and<br>
phenolic derivatives such as phenolic reaction products. This is an<br>
especially desirable advantage in view of the efforts of the trade to<br>
reduce or eliminate such phenolic products because of environmental<br>
concerns. Also, as developed above, such phenols are a source of color<br>
development, in addition, enhanced shelf stability for the powders and<br>
mixed metal stabilizer compositions of the invention have been<br>
demonstrated over presently commercially available products. In<br>
particular, presently available liquid overbased calcium fatty acid<br>
carboxylates exhibit the development of turbidity or haze, whereas the<br>
powdered compositions of this invention remain stable over extended<br>
periods of time. The isolated powders of this invention also allow easy<br>
handling and storage. The powders may be dispersed in liquid<br>
hydrocarbons and other solvents to form haze free liquids. Thus, the<br>
redispersion of the powders is not restricted to certain media. The<br>
promoters and reaction diluents are removed from the powders. Also,<br>
higher concentrations of up to about 25% of calcium, for example, are<br>
achievable upon redispersion. When the mixed metal stabilizer systems<br>
containing powdered overbased barium or calcium carboxylates are<br>
employed in vinyl halide polymers, they exhibit better compatibilities with<br>
improvements in thermal stability, clarity and plate out resistance.<br>
!n contrast to overbased crystalline powders where, for<br>
example, the crystalline needles or platelets adversely increase the<br>
viscosities or rheologies of end use products such as lubricating oils and<br>
emollients, the overbased amorphous powders of this invention offer<br>
significantly improved properties of neutralization of acidic moeities<br>
without adversely affecting viscosities in end uses. Improved detergency<br>
in end uses are also achieved by the new amorphous powders of this<br>
invention.<br>
The above advantages, benefits and further understanding<br>
of this invention will be apparent with reference to the following detailed<br>
description and preferred embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A. Powdered Overbased Amorphous Salts Derived from Shelf Stable<br>
Haze Free Liquids of Overbased Alkaline Earth Metal Salts<br>
In one preferred form of the invention, the powdered<br>
overbased amorphous salts are derived from a shelf stable haze free liquid<br>
of an amorphous overbased alkaline earth metal salt of a fatty acid which<br>
comprises<br>
an alkaline earth metal carbonate,<br>
an alkaline earth metal carboxylate of a fatty acid,<br>
a liquid hydrocarbon, and<br>
an aliphatic alcohol having at least 8 carbon atoms, with the<br>
liquid being preferably free of a phenol or a phenolic derivative such as a<br>
phenolic reaction product.<br>
In another form of the invention, the amorphous alkaline<br>
earth metal sulfate, sulfide or sulfite may be formed instead of the<br>
carbonate where the acidic gas used in the process is sulfur dioxide,<br>
sulfur trioxide, carbon disulfide, or hydrogen sulfide.<br>
The powdered overbased amorphous salt is isolated by<br>
precipitation from the liquid overbased salts using a solvent or liquid<br>
precipitating agent, such as isopropyl alcohol, for the liquid hydrocarbon<br>
and/or alcohols and glycols which may be present, to cause solid particles<br>
of the overbased salts to form by agglomeration of the amorphous<br>
particles. The agglomerated particles of the overbased salts are then<br>
obtained by filtration and drying. It is preferred to precipitate the solids<br>
from the liquid salts to eliminate the need to distill volatiles or use<br>
specialized equipment to particulate and collect the powder, for example,<br>
by spraying. The agglomerated particle sizes for the overbased<br>
amorphous salts range from about 50 microns, although particle size is<br>
not considered critical. It has also been found that these powders are<br>
dispersible in liquid hydrocarbons and other solvents to prepare haze free<br>
liquids which have a wide variety of end uses, as reported hereinafter.<br>
Other solvents, or liquid precipitating agents, such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and glycol ethers may be used to<br>
precipitate the powders or agglomerated particles from the liquid<br>
overbased salts. The lower alcohols are preferred because they are more<br>
readily removed from the filtered product by drying. Such solvents or<br>
liquids have been used as "conversion agents" to convert the Newtonian<br>
overbased liquids to non-Newtonian colloidal systems with the separation<br>
of crystalline calcite particles as disclosed in U.S. Patents<br>
Nos. 3,766,066 and 3,766,067, as stated in the above background of<br>
this invention. In contrast, according to this invention, the overbased<br>
amorphous salts have been isolated by the addition of an excessive<br>
amount of the solvent for the liquid hydrocarbon and alcohol phase of the<br>
haze free overbased liquids. It has been found, by so treating the haze<br>
free overbased liquids of this invention, that powdered overbased<br>
amorphous salts can be isolated in contrast to the crystalline calcitecontaining<br>
powders of the mentioned prior patents. Thus, when the<br>
solvents are added in sufficient amounts of about 5 to 1 of the haze free<br>
overbased liquids, the overbased amorphous salts agglomerate to produce<br>
the powdered overbased amorphous products of this invention. The<br>
process is believed to be solvent extraction of the liquid hydrocarbons<br>
from the liquid overbased compositions.<br>
The fatty acid of the overbased liquid carboxylate is<br>
generally a C12-C22 fatty acid, including, for example, lauric, myristic,<br>
palmitic, stearic, archidic and behenic, among the saturated fatty acids.<br>
Unsaturated fatty acids include palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic.<br>
Among these fatty acids, oleic is presently preferred in preparing the<br>
overbased liquid carboxylates.<br>
The alkaline earth metal of the salt is selected from the<br>
group consisting of calcium, barium, magnesium and strontium. For<br>
example, powdered overbased calcium oleates have been prepared.<br>
These powdered overbased calcium salts contain amorphous calcium<br>
carbonate complexed with calcium oleate.<br>
In the method of making the liquid overbased salts from<br>
which the powdered amorphous salts are derived, it is important to have<br>
an aliphatic alcohol having at least 8 carbon atoms, more preferably an<br>
alcohol having 8 to 14 carbon atoms, such as, isodecanol, dodecanol,<br>
octanol, tridecanol and tetradecanol. Isodecanol is presently preferred.<br>
It has been found that when a higher aliphatic alcohol is employed in<br>
making the liquid overbased product, phenol may be excluded from the<br>
reaction as a promoter. This is a particularly advantageous feature of the<br>
invention where it is undesirable to have a phenol or phenolic reaction<br>
product involved in the manufacture or use of the powdered overbased<br>
amorphous salts.<br>
While not being strictly bound by theory, the liquid<br>
overbased alkaline earth salt of the fatty acid is believed to be a<br>
thermodynamically stable microemulsion. The microemulsion has micelles<br>
and a continuous phase. The micelles consist of an amorphous alkaline<br>
earth metal carbonate and an amorphous alkaline earth metal carboxylate<br>
of the fatty acid. The continuous phase of the microemulsion consists of<br>
the liquid hydrocarbon and the aliphatic alcohols or glycols which may be<br>
present. This invention is directed to isolating particles which are the<br>
agglomerated micelles of the amorphous salts to form the powdered<br>
overbased salts.<br>
Powdered overbased amorphous metal salts have been<br>
prepared containing at least 8% by weight or more of the alkaline earth<br>
metal up to about 70% by weight, in the case of the overbased calcium<br>
salts, up to about 8% by weight calcium are produced and, for barium<br>
salts, up to about 30% by weight barium may be produced. In the<br>
preparation of higher overbased products, for example, containing about<br>
1 5-70% by weight metal, it has been found suitable to use a glycol or a<br>
glycoi ether along with the higher aliphatic alcohol. A glycol or glycol<br>
ether may be selected from the group consisting of diethylene glycol<br>
monobutyl ether (butyl Carbitol®), triethylene glycol, dipropylene giycoi,<br>
diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
B. The Basic Process and Critical Features of Making the Overbased<br>
Liquids and Powders Derived Therefrom<br>
The process of the present invention for preparing a shelf<br>
stable haze free liquid of an overbased alkaline earth metal salt of a fatty<br>
acid comprises reacting an alkaline earth metal base and a fatty acid with<br>
an equivalent ratio of metal base to the fatty acid being greater than 1:1<br>
in the presence of a mixture of liquid hydrocarbon. A surfactant and<br>
catalyst promote the reaction. The mixture is acidified and preferably<br>
carbonated to produce amorphous alkaline earth metal carbonate. During<br>
carbonation, a dispersion is added containing alkaline earth metal base,<br>
liquid hydrocarbon and an aliphatic alcohol having at least 8 carbon atoms<br>
in relative amounts at a controlled rate of base addition to produce a<br>
stable haze free liquid reaction product. Water is removed from the<br>
reaction product to produce a shelf stable haze free liquid overbased<br>
alkaline earth metal salt. Generally, it is preferred that the entire process<br>
be conducted in the absence of free oxygen and, for this purpose, an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen is used.<br>
As developed above, one of the important features of the<br>
method is the step of adding during carbonation a dispersion of alkaline<br>
earth metal base, liquid hydrocarbon and an aliphatic alcohol having at<br>
least 8 carbon atoms at a controlled rate of base addition to produce the<br>
stable haze free liquid. It has been found that the addition of a dispersion<br>
of the base in the liquid hydrocarbon and aliphatic alcohol protects or<br>
passivates the base, thereby enabling the formation of a stable haze free<br>
) liquid reaction product. By protecting or passivating the base,<br>
carbonation proceeds to produce amorphous alkaline earth metal<br>
carbonate. Unexpectedly, the reaction proceeds without the need to<br>
remove water during the reaction and results in a very stable haze free<br>
liquid reaction product. At the end of the reaction, water is removed,<br>
preferably to the level of less than 1 %, more preferably less than 0.3%<br>
or 0.1 %, in the obtainment of the shelf stable liquid overbased salt. The<br>
removal of water which is added during the reaction or formed by the<br>
reaction is necessitated because it forms a separate phase which impedes<br>
either the product of the reaction or the formation of a shelf stable haze<br>
free liquid.<br>
Other features of the method include filtering the product of<br>
the reaction to produce a shelf or thermodynamically stable liquid at a<br>
product filtration rate of at least about 300 ml per 10 minutes. In a<br>
preferred form of the invention, the product which is produced is filterable<br>
to remove unwanted byproducts and enhance the shelf stability of the<br>
overbased liquid. For example, with a Buchner funnel having a 1 5 cm<br>
diameter under vacuum of about 25-30 inches Hg with a Whatman No. 1<br>
filter and a diatomaceous filtering aid (Celite® 512-577), the product is<br>
filterable at satisfactory rates. One of the important discoveries of the<br>
method of this invention is the ability to filter the reaction product to form<br>
a stable haze free liquid at filtration rates which heretofore were<br>
unachievable. This was especially the case when higher levels of metal<br>
content in the overbased liquids were desired, especially overbased<br>
calcium liquids. Thus, filtration removes undesirable impurities including<br>
silica, iron oxide and other metal species, unreacted calcium hydroxide,<br>
calcium carbonate, and other oxides which may contribute to lack of<br>
stability. These byproducts or impurities may comprise up to about 6%<br>
of byproduct of the reaction.<br>
Throughout this specification and claims, the term "basic"<br>
or "overbased" as applied to the alkaline earth metal salts is used to refer<br>
to metal compositions wherein the ratio of total metal contained therein<br>
to the fatty acid moieties is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of the<br>
neutral metal salt. That is, the number of metal equivalents is greater<br>
than the number of equivalents of the fatty acid. In some instances, the<br>
degree to which excess metal is found in the basic metal salt is described<br>
in terms of a "metal ratio". Metal ratio as used herein indicates the ratio<br>
of total alkaline earth metal in the oil-soluble composition to the number<br>
of equivalents of the fatty acid or organic moiety. The basic metal salts<br>
often have been referred to in the art as "overbased" or "superbased"<br>
to indicate the presence of an excess of the basic component.<br>
The process of the present invention may be used to prepare<br>
shelf stable liquids and isolated powders of the amorphous alkaline earth<br>
metal carboxylates of the fatty acids. As stated above, the method may<br>
be practiced without the use of phenol promoter or phenolic reaction<br>
product. Therefore, liquid and powdered overbased barium fatty acid<br>
3 carboxylates have been made without the need for a phenol or phenolic<br>
reaction product in order to achieve a shelf stable haze free liquid. In the<br>
case of liquid and powdered overbased calcium fatty acid carboxylates,<br>
shelf stable products are obtained without a phenol where the aliphatic<br>
alcohol having at least 8 carbon atoms is employed.<br>
The alkaline earth metal bases utilized as a reaction<br>
component may be derived from any alkaline earth metals and, of these,<br>
calcium and barium bases are particularly preferred. The metal bases<br>
include metal oxides and hydroxides and, in some instances, the sulfides,<br>
hydro sulfides, etc. While a phenolic component or reactant may<br>
preferably be excluded from a reaction, in the case of liquid overbased<br>
calcium products, the phenol or alkyl phenol may be included to yield<br>
liquid overbased products. As stated above, the fatty acids, or mixtures<br>
thereof, as identified above may be used in the reaction mixture. For<br>
example, a surfactant that facilitates the reaction is the alkaline earth<br>
metal carboxylate of the fatty acid that is formed in situ. Other<br>
surfactants may be included, for example, general purpose surface active<br>
agents identified under the trademark Tween which are polyoxyethylene<br>
derivatives of fatty acid partial esters of sorbitol anhydrides, particularly<br>
mono- and di-oleates of the ethoxylated sorbitol, and polyisobutylene<br>
succinic acid. Furthermore, it is desirable to include a catalyst to<br>
facilitate the speed of the reaction such as propionic acid, citric acid,<br>
acetic acid and adipic acid. The hydrocarbon liquid employed in the<br>
process and the liquid reaction products generally includes any<br>
hydrocarbon diluent. Most generally, the liquid hydrocarbon is selected<br>
from the group of an oil, mineral spirits and non-aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
C. Amounts of Reactants and Catalysts<br>
The amount of alkaline earth metal base utilized in the<br>
preparation of basic salts is an amount which is more than one equivalent<br>
of the base per equivalent of fatty acid or organic moiety, and more<br>
generally, will be an amount sufficient to provide at least three<br>
equivalents of the metal base per equivalent of the acid. Larger amounts<br>
can be utilized to form more basic compounds, and the amount of metal<br>
base included may be any amount up to that amount which is no longer<br>
effective to increase the proportion of metal in the product. When<br>
preparing the mixture, the amount of fatty acid and the alcohol included<br>
in the mixture is not critical except that the ratio of equivalents of the<br>
metal base of the combination of the other components in the mixture<br>
should be greater than 1:1 in order to provide a basic product. More<br>
generally, the ratio of equivalents will be at least 3:1. In those instances<br>
where phenol may be present in making an overbased calcium, the ratio<br>
of equivalents of monocarboxylic acid to phenol should be at least about<br>
1.1:1; that is, the monocarboxylic acid is present in excess with respect<br>
to the phenol.<br>
The ranges of hydrocarbon oil, aliphatic alcohol (preferably<br>
isodecanol), butyl Carbitol and triethylene glycol have been selected such<br>
that, in the presence of the alkaline earth fatty acid salt (i.e. Ca oleate)<br>
which acts as a primary surfactant, the mixture forms a stable inverse<br>
microemulsion of the metal carbonate, water, and surfactant (internal<br>
phase) and surfactant, cosurfactant, and hydrocarbon (external<br>
continuous phase).<br>
The acceptable ratios of hydrocarbon oil to cosurfactant<br>
aliphatic alcohol (isodecanol) are about 2:1 to about 4:1, with about 2:1<br>
preferred. The glycol ethers may be used at about 1-15% of the final<br>
product, buty! Carbitol preferably at about 6%, and triethylene glycol at<br>
about 0-2%, preferably at about 0.6%.<br>
The lime slurry which is added to the oleic acid in the<br>
reaction is formulated to be an easily pumpable mixture with the general<br>
composition of about 40-50% lime, about 25-40% hydrocarbon oil, about<br>
10-25% isodecanol, and about 0-10% butyl Carbitol. The butyl Carbitol<br>
amount that is needed to make a pumpable slurry increases as the % lime<br>
in the slurry increases.<br>
The reaction mixture for an overbased calcium oleate, after<br>
addition of the slurry and carbonation with carbon dioxide, preferably has<br>
the following composition ranges:<br>
Ca oleate (surfactant) about 15-30%<br>
Ca carbonate about 9-35%<br>
Hydrocarbon oil about 30-35%<br>
Isodecanol (cosurfactant) about 15-18%<br>
Butyl Carbitol about 4-6%<br>
Triethylene glycol about 0-0.8%<br>
The catalyst, propionic acid or a lower aliphatic mono, di, or<br>
tricarboxylic acid is used in the amount of about 0-0.1% of the final<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Substitution of magnesium, strontium, or barium for calcium<br>
in the overbased salt is done on an equivalent basis of the metal<br>
hydroxide. On the basis of the final reaction mixture, the following<br>
amounts may be used:<br>
Ca(OH)2 (lime) about 15-30%<br>
Mg(OH)2 about 12-24%<br>
Sr(OH)2 about 25-50%<br>
Ba(OH)2 about 35-50%<br>
The step of carbonation involves treating the mixtures<br>
described above with an acidic gas in the absence of free oxygen until the<br>
titratable basicity is determined using phenolphthalein. Generally, the<br>
titratable basicity is reduced to a base number below about 10. The<br>
mixing and carbonation steps of the present invention require no unusual<br>
operating conditions other than preferably the exclusion of free oxygen.<br>
The base, fatty acid and liquid hydrocarbon are mixed, generally heated,<br>
and then treated with carbon dioxide as the acidic gas, and the mixture<br>
may be heated to a temperature which is sufficient to drive off some of<br>
the water contained in the mixture. The treatment of the mixture with<br>
the carbon dioxide preferably is conducted at elevated temperatures, and<br>
the range of temperatures used for this step may be any temperature<br>
above ambient temperature up to about 200°C, and more preferably from<br>
a temperature of about 75°C to about 200°C. Higher temperatures may<br>
be used such as 250°C, but there is no apparent advantage in the use of<br>
such higher temperatures. Ordinarily, a temperature of about 80°C to<br>
150°C is satisfactory.<br>
By the term "acidic gas" as used in this specification and in<br>
the claims is meant a gas which upon reaction with water will produce<br>
an acid. Thus, such gases as sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, etc., are exemplary of the<br>
acidic gases which are useful in the process of this invention. Of these<br>
acids, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide are preferred, and the most<br>
preferred is carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide is used the alkaline<br>
earth carbonate is formed. When the sulfur gases are used, the sulfate,<br>
sulfide and sulfite salts are formed.<br>
D. Halogen-Containing Polymer<br>
A halogen-containing polymer, such as a vinyl halide resin,<br>
most commonly stabilized with the basic metal salts of this invention is<br>
polyvinyl chloride. It is to be understood, however, that this invention is<br>
not limited to a particular vinyl halide resin such as polyvinyl chloride or<br>
its copolymers. Other halogen-containing resins which are employed and<br>
which illustrate the principles of this invention include chlorinated<br>
polyethylene, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, chlorinated polyvinyl<br>
chloride, and other vinyl halide resin types. Vinyl halide resin, as<br>
understood herein, and as appreciated in the art, is a common term and<br>
is adopted to define those resins or polymers usually derived by<br>
polymerization or copolymerization of vinyl monomers including vinyl<br>
chloride with or without other comonomers such as ethylene, propylene,<br>
vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers, vinylidene chloride, methacrylate, acrylates,<br>
styrene, etc. A simple case is the conversion of vinyl chloride H2C=CHCI<br>
to polyvinyl chloride (CH2CHCI —)nwherein the halogen is bonded to the<br>
carbon atoms of the carbon chain of the polymer. Other examples of<br>
such vinyl hahde resins would include vinylidene chloride polymers, vinyl<br>
chloride-vinyl ester copolymers, vinyl chloride-vinyl ether copolymers,<br>
vinyl chloride-vinylidene copolymers, vinyl chloride-propylene copolymers,<br>
chlorinated polyethylene, and the like. Of course, the vinyl halide<br>
commonly used in the industry is the chloride, although others such as<br>
bromide and fluoride may be used. Examples of the latter polymers<br>
include polyvinyl bromide, polyvinyl fluoride, and copolymers thereof.<br>
Metal compound heat stabilizers of vinyl halide resin<br>
compositions are well known. These metal compounds serve to capture<br>
HCI liberated during heat processing of the vinyl halide resin composition<br>
into its final shape. The metal can be lead, cadmium, barium, calcium,<br>
zinc, strontium, bismuth, tin, or antimony, for example. The stabilizers<br>
are usually metal salts of a carboxylic acid, advantageously of a C8-C24<br>
carbon chain link rnonocarboxylic acid such as lauric, oleic, stearic,<br>
octoic, or similar fatty acid salts. Metal salts of alkyl phenates may be<br>
used. Mixed metal salts of such acids, and their preparation, are familiar<br>
to those skilled in the art to which this present invention pertains. Mixed<br>
metallic carboxylates involving calcium/zinc or barium/zinc blends alone<br>
and in combination with other stabilizers or additives such as betadiketones,<br>
phosphite salts and phenolic antioxidants have been used. The<br>
metal stabilizer is a mixed metal salt of a carboxylic acid. Mixed metal<br>
salts of such acids, and their preparation, are also familiar to those skilled<br>
in the art to which this present invention pertains.<br>
E. End Uses for the Liquid or Powdered Products<br>
As stated above, the liquid or powdered products of this<br>
invention may be used in a number of end products such as lubricants,<br>
catalysts, oil well compositions, animal nutrition and cosmetics. Other<br>
specific examples include: wall covering, flooring (vinyl tile and inlay),<br>
medical devices, dip coating, chair mat, banner film, pigment dispersion,<br>
vinyl siding, piping, fuel additive, cosmetic, ceiling tile, roofing film, wear<br>
layer, play balls or toys, teeter, fencing, corrugated wall panels,<br>
dashboards, and shifter boots.<br>
For example, liquid and powdered overbased amorphous<br>
metal carboxylates of the following Examples can be used in the<br>
following applications.<br>
1. Liquid and powdered products can be used in PVC stabilizer<br>
components with high metal concentration. The powdered<br>
materials can either be used as is in powdered stabilizers, or easily<br>
dispersed in mineral oil to produce a concentrated stabilizer<br>
component with only the mineral oil as a diluent.<br>
2. The dispersed powdered products can be used as nanoparticle<br>
templates to create microporous substrates with holes of defined<br>
size, about 0.1 (Jm in diameter. Other nanoparticle applications<br>
include reinforcing or non-reinforcing fillers for plastics, and<br>
radiopaque but visually clear fillers (Ba) for medical applications.<br>
3. Dispersed into oil and fuel, the powdered product can be used in<br>
a lubricant oil as a detergent and acid neutralizer.<br>
4. The overbased amorphous calcium oleate powder, made in a nontoxic<br>
formulation, can be used as a fat mimetic. The material has<br>
an amorphous mineral core (calcium carbonate) with a fatty acid<br>
coating.<br>
5. The powdered overbased calcium oleate/carbonate can be used as<br>
a high calcium content dietary supplement for animal or human<br>
nutrition. The small particle size, and fatty acid salt coating on the<br>
particles makes the material more palatable and active than<br>
uncoated calcium carbonate. The material can also serve to<br>
neutralize excess stomach acid.<br>
6. The small size, the fatty acid coating, and the solid nature of the<br>
particle makes it suitable as an ingredient in skin care products as<br>
an emollient and acid neutralizer.<br>
7. Dispersed in a suitable carrier, the liquid and powder can be used<br>
in metalworking lubricant formulations.<br>
8. The liquid and powdered products can be used as lubricant<br>
additives in oil well drilling applications in drilling mud formulations.<br>
9. The liquid and powdered products can be used in oil recovery<br>
fluids, flooding fluids, spotting fluids, fluid loss components of<br>
drilling muds, and cementing fluids in oil well operations.<br>
10. In combination with a cationic water-soluble polymer (hydrogel),<br>
the powder can be used as an oil spill absorber, oil absorbing<br>
component of air filters to improve indoor air quality.<br>
11. The powder can be used as a component of a coating formulation,<br>
to improve the water-repellency and anti-corrosion qualities of the<br>
film.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the haze<br>
free liquid overbased salts (Examples 1-6 and 10) and the powdered<br>
overbased amorphous metal salts derived therefrom (Examples 7-9 and<br>
11-12) in accordance with the method of the present invention. These<br>
examples are not considered to be limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated in the following examples and elsewhere in<br>
the specification and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight, and<br>
all temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
10% Overbased Calcium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A phenol-free 10% overbased calcium oleate/carbonate was<br>
prepared according to this Example. A mixture of 308.42 g of oleic acid<br>
(1.100 moles), 213.15 g mineral oil, 154.14 g of isodecyl alcohol,<br>
63.08 g of butyl Carbitol, 8.70 g of triethylene glycol, 26.97 g of water<br>
and 0.87 g of propionic acid was heated to 190°F, with stirring, under<br>
a nitrogen atmosphere. To the stirred mixture there was continuously<br>
added a dispersion comprised of 38.98 g mineral oil, 13.86 g isodecyl<br>
alcohol, 3.71 g butyl Carbitol and 43.28 g of lime (0.5498 moles) for<br>
about 33 minutes to produce a solution of calcium oleate in the mixture.<br>
The dispersion was added at a rate of about 3 g per minute. At this point<br>
in the reaction, the mixture tested basic with phenolphthalein (about<br>
10-12 pH). Then, to the stirred mixture there was continuously added,<br>
over a period of about 3 hours and 56 minutes, a dispersion comprised<br>
of 276.25 g mineral oil, 98.23 g isodecyl alcohol, 26.31 g butyl Carbitol<br>
and 306.75 g lime (3.897 moles) while the mixture was being treated<br>
with carbon dioxide at 1.5 SCFH at 1 95-200°F. The dispersion was also<br>
added at a rate of about 3 g per minute. The basicity of the reaction was<br>
checked to maintain the basicity during the reaction. When the reaction<br>
mixture tested nearly neutral to phenolphthalein, the carbon dioxide<br>
addition was discontinued. The reaction mixture was then heated to<br>
300°F and a total of 99.36 g of water was removed via a Dean-Stark<br>
trap. The resulting product mixture was stirred and 24.00 g of filter aid<br>
(diatomaceous earth) was added. The product mixture was filtered with<br>
suction, as stated above in the description, at about 300 ml per<br>
10 minutes, yielding a clear, amber, mobile liquid filtrate of overbased<br>
calcium oleate/carbonate which remained clear upon cooling to room<br>
temperature. The filtrate was analyzed to contain 10.4% Calcium by<br>
weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
14% Overbased Calcium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A phenol-free overbased calcium oleate/carbonate containing<br>
14% calcium by weight was made according to this Example. In a 3-liter<br>
resin kettle equipped with an overhead stirrer, two gas inlet tubes, a<br>
thermocouple, heating mantle and Dean-Stark trap with condenser, was<br>
added 1 700 g of a 9.89% overbased calcium oleate/carboxylate made by<br>
the method of the previous example and 42.5 g of deionized water. The<br>
mixture was heated with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to a<br>
temperature of 195°F, and a slurry containing 385 g of hydrated lime<br>
(94% calcium hydroxide), 231 g of hydrocarbon oil, 96.25 g of isodecyl<br>
alcohol, and 57.75 g of butyl Carbitol was added at a rate of 3.42 g per<br>
minute over a 3 hour 45 minute period. After 5 minutes of slurry<br>
addition, carbon dioxide was added to the reaction at a rate of 1.2<br>
standard cubic feet per hour. During the carbonation, a temperature of<br>
195-200°F was maintained and pH was monitored as in Example 1.<br>
After the slurry addition was finished, the carbon dioxide<br>
addition was continued until the reaction mixture was neutral, as shown<br>
by a colorless sample when tested with phenolphthalein. The reaction<br>
mixture was then heated to 300°F and both the water added and the<br>
water produced in the reaction was removed via the Dean-Stark trap. To<br>
the dehydrated reaction product was added 75 g of diatomaceous earth<br>
and the product was filtered with suction, as above in Example 1, yielding<br>
a clear, amber, mobile liquid filtrate of overbased calcium<br>
oleate/carboxylate which remained clear on cooling to room temperature.<br>
The filtrate was analyzed to contain 14.5% calcium by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
10% Overbased Calcium Oleate/Carbonate, GRAS Indirect Food Additive<br>
Formula<br>
A phenol-free 10% overbased calcium oleate/carbonate<br>
containing only materials generally recognized as safe as indirect food<br>
additive was prepared as follows. A mixture of 520.6 g of oleic acid<br>
(1.85 moles), 522 g of Shellflex™ 6111 light mineral oil, 259 g of dodecyl<br>
alcohol, and 32.4 g of propylene glycol was heated to 180°F and 2.0 g<br>
of propionic acid and 1 5.0 g of water was added. To the stirred reaction<br>
mixture there was continuously added a slurry comprised of 345.6 g of<br>
Shellflex™ 6111, 1 72.8 g of dodecyl alcohol, 21.6 g of propylene glycol,<br>
and 540 g of lime (94% available as calcium hydroxide) at a rate of 4.0 g<br>
per minute. After approximately 41 minutes of slurry addition, the oleic<br>
acid was neutralized and excess lime was present and partially dissolved<br>
) to give an apparent pH of 11.4. Then carbon dioxide gas was passed<br>
into the reaction mixture through a subsurface addition tube at a rate of<br>
approximately 495 ml/minute to produce and maintain a pH of 10.5-11<br>
for the duration of the slurry addition (approximately 5.25 hours), while<br>
maintaining the reaction temperature at 190-192°F with mild cooling,<br>
When approximately 1080 g of slurry had been added, the slurry addition<br>
was turned off and the carbon dioxide addition was continued until the<br>
pH of the reaction dropped to 7.5 (approximately 7 minutes). The<br>
reaction was carefully placed under 22.5 inches of vacuum and heated<br>
to 310°F over a 1.75-hour period while removing the added water and<br>
the water of reaction via a Dean-Stark tube. The reaction was held at<br>
310°F and 30 g of diatomaceous earth filter aid was added. The product<br>
was filtered hot with suction as stated in the previous example at a rate<br>
of 545 ml per 10 minutes, yielding a clear, yellow-amber mobile filtrate<br>
of overbased calcium oleate/carbonate which remained clear on cooling<br>
to room temperature. The filtrate was analyzed to contain 10.5%<br>
calcium by weight. The infrared spectrum of the material showed a peak<br>
at 864 reciprocal centimeters, characteristic of amorphous calcium<br>
carbonate.1<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
15% Overbased Calcium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A highly overbased calcium oleate/carbonate containing<br>
1 5.4% calcium by weight was produced by the following procedure. To<br>
a mixture of 1700 g of an 11.4% overbased calcium oleate/carbonate<br>
The physical slate of the calcium carbonate in the materials prepared in the examples<br>
was analyzed by X-ray powder pattern for crystallinity and by infrared spectra.<br>
Amorphous calcium carbonate has an infrared absorption at 864 reciprocal centimeters,<br>
according to ;i paper "Infrared Spectra of Amorphous and Crystalline Calcium<br>
Carbonate" by Andersen and Brecevic, Acta Chemica Scandinavica 45 (1991) 1018-<br>
1024, The other crystalline polymorphs of calcium carbonate, calcite, aragonite and<br>
vatente have corresponding infrared absorptions at 877, 856, and 877 reciprocal<br>
centimeters, respectively.<br>
liquid produced according to the previous example was added 50 g of<br>
water and the mixture was heated to 190°F under stirring at 1000 rpm.<br>
To the mixture was added a 720 g portion of a slurry made from 500 g<br>
of lime (94% available as calcium hydroxide), 320 g of Shellflex™ 6111<br>
light mineral oil, 1 60 g of dodecyl alcohol, and 20 g of propylene glycol<br>
at a rate of 3.97 g per minute over a 3 hour 40 minute period. After 2<br>
minutes of slurry addition, carbon dioxide gas was introduced to the<br>
reaction mixture through a subsurface addition tube at a rate to produce<br>
and maintain the apparent pH of the reaction mixture at a value of<br>
10.5-11 (approximately 450-550 ml/minute). After the time required to<br>
add the required amount of lime slurry passed, the slurry addition was<br>
discontinued and the carbon dioxide addition continued until the pH of the<br>
reaction fell to 7.5 (about 10 minutes). The reaction was then heated<br>
under a vacuum of 22.5" while heating slowly to 310°F. The water<br>
added and the water of reaction was removed via a Dean-Stark trap. The<br>
reaction mixture was then filtered through a bed of diatomaceous earth<br>
(filter aid) to give a clear, amber mobile filtrate of a highly overbased<br>
calcium oieate/carbonate. The material was analyzed to contain 1 5.4%<br>
calcium by weight. The infrared spectrum of the material showed a<br>
characteristic peak for amorphous calcium carbonate at 864 reciprocal<br>
centimeters.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
14% Overbased Strontium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A phenol-free strontium oleate/carbonate containing about<br>
14% strontium was prepared by the following procedure. A mixture of<br>
41 3 g of oleic acid, 600 g of Shellflex™ 6111 light mineral oil, 300 g of<br>
isodecyl alcohol, 40 g of butyl carbitol, and 4 g of triethylene glycol was<br>
heated to 176°F, and 1000 g of strontium hydroxide octahydrate was<br>
added. The reaction mixture was heated to 275°F over a 2.5-hour<br>
period, while removing 550 g of water via a Dean-Stark trap with the aid<br>
of a nitrogen sparge at 2.0 SCFH. After the rate of water removal<br>
slowed, the nitrogen sparge was turned off, and carbon dioxide gas was<br>
added to the reaction via a subsurface addition tube at a rate of<br>
450 ml/minute, and the water formed was continually removed. After 7<br>
hours of carbon dioxide addition at 250-275°F, the carbon dioxide was<br>
turned off, the temperature of the reaction was raised to 300°F and the<br>
remaining water was removed with the assistance of a nitrogen sparge<br>
at 2.0 SCFH. The reaction was then filtered hot with suction with the<br>
assistance of filter aid, yielding the overbased strontium oleate carbonate<br>
as a light yellow, clear mobile liquid. The product was analyzed to<br>
contain 14.25% strontium by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
4.5% Overbased Magnesium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A phenol-free magnesium oleate/carbonate containing about<br>
4.5% magnesium was prepared by the following procedure. A mixture<br>
of 529.3 g of oleic acid, 600 g of Shellflex™ 6111 light mineral oil, 400 g<br>
of isopropyl alcohol, 350 g of isodecyl alcohol, 400 g of water was<br>
heated to 140°F and 400 g of magnesium hydroxide was added. The<br>
neutralization of the acid with the magnesium hydroxide caused the<br>
temperature to rise to 167°F. Carbon dioxide gas was passed into the<br>
reaction mixture through a subsurface addition tube at a rate of<br>
225 ml/minute for 6 hours, during which time the temperature was<br>
gradually raised to 223°F and 720 ml of a mixture of water and isopropyl<br>
alcohol was removed. The temperature was raised to 305°F and the<br>
remaining water was removed with the assistance of the carbon dioxide<br>
addition. The carbon dioxide addition was stopped, and the hot reaction<br>
mixture was filtered with suction with the assistance of filter aid, giving<br>
the overbased magnesium product as a clear light yellow mobile liquid.<br>
The product was analyzed to contain 4.5% magnesium by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
21.38% Overbased Amorphous Calcium Oleate/Carbonate Powder<br>
To 1000 g of rapidly stirred isopropyl alcohol was added<br>
200 g of an overbased calcium oleate/carbonate liquid containing 10.5%<br>
calcium by weight (product prepared as in Example 3) in a steady stream<br>
over a period of 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 1 hour, and then filtered with suction. The filter cake was washed<br>
with 2x100 g of isopropyl alcohol, sucked as dry as possible, and then<br>
allowed to dry at room temperature overnight. The powder obtained<br>
showed no crystalline nature by x-ray powder pattern, and dispersed<br>
easily in mineral oil to give a clear, isotropic, non-viscous dispersion. The<br>
powder was found to contain 21.38% calcium by weight. An infrared<br>
spectrum of the powder (nujol mull) showed a peak at 866 reciprocal<br>
centimeters, characteristic of amorphous calcium carbonate.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
20.2% Overbased Amorphous Calcium Oleate/Carbonate Powder<br>
A powdered overbased amorphous calcium oleate/carbonate<br>
was prepared according to the following example. To 1500 g of<br>
isopropyl alcohol, rapidly stirred and heated to reflux, 500 g of overbased<br>
calcium oleate/carbonate liquid containing 9.76% calcium by weight<br>
(product of example 1 above) was added over a 1 5-minute period. The<br>
mixture was allowed to reflux a further Vahour, and then allowed to cool<br>
to 90°F and filtered with suction. The collected solids were washed with<br>
2x125 g of isopropyl alcohol, and sucked as dry as possible. The solid<br>
) product was allowed to dry at room temperature overnight and yielded<br>
262 g of an off-white solid, which was analyzed to contain 20.2%<br>
calcium by weight. The material was easily dispersed in mineral oil at<br>
70% solid to give a clear, mobile dispersion with a calcium content of<br>
13.83% by weight. An infrared spectrum of the powder (nujol mull)<br>
showed a peak at 866 reciprocal centimeters, characteristic of<br>
amorphous calcium carbonate. The powder particles, dispersed in mineral<br>
spirits, showed a mean particle diameter of 0.112 microns.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
28% Overbased Amorphous Calcium Oleate/Carbonate Powder<br>
A powdered overbased amorphous calcium oleate/carbonate<br>
powder was prepared according to the following example. 200 g of an<br>
overbased calcium oleate/carbonate liquid dispersion containing 15.4%<br>
calcium by weight (prepared by Example 4, above) was added in a steady<br>
stream to 1000 g of rapidly stirred isopropyl alcohol in a 5-minute period.<br>
The mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional hour, then<br>
filtered with suction, washed with 2x100 ml of isopropyl alcohol, and<br>
sucked as dry as possible. The product was allowed to dry in air at room<br>
temperature overnight, yielding a free-flowing off-white powder that was<br>
analyzed to contain 28% calcium by weight. An infrared spectrum of the<br>
powder (nujol mull) showed a peak at 866 reciprocal centimeters,<br>
characteristic of amorphous calcium carbonate. An X-ray powder pattern<br>
showed only broad peaks, with no peaks from calcite (crystalline calcium<br>
carbonate). The powder, dispersed in mineral spirits, showed a mean<br>
particle diameter of 0.0566 microns.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
30% Overbased Amorphous Barium Oleate/Carbonate<br>
A phenol-free overbased amorphous barium oleate/carbonate<br>
was prepared according to the following example. A mixture of 502.5 g<br>
of oleic acid, 581 g of HVI mineral oil, 200.0 g of Epal™14-1 8 (a mixture<br>
of aliphatic alcohols containing 14 to 18 carbon atoms), 102 g of butyl<br>
carbitol (diethylene glycol monobutylether and 10.2 g ortriethylene glycol<br>
was heated to 178°F under a slow stream of nitrogen. To the heater<br>
reaction mixture was added 1034.1 g of barium hydroxide monohydrate<br>
in three increments over a 45-minute period. The temperature of the<br>
reaction mixture was then raised to 280°F over a one-hour period, and<br>
75.6 g of water was removed via a Dean-Stark trap with the aid of the<br>
nitrogen flow of 2 SCFH. The nitrogen flow was reduced to 1 SCFH and<br>
carbon dioxide was added via a subsurface addition tube at a rate of<br>
about 300 ml/min over a 5 Yz hour period, during which time the<br>
temperature was gradually raised from 280° F to 300°F and water was<br>
removed via a Dean-Stark trap at the approximate rate of 7.5 g every 1 5<br>
minutes after 2 hours.<br>
At the end of the carbon dioxide addition time, the reaction<br>
) was carefuhy placed under 22 inches of vacuum and the remaining water<br>
was removed, along with a small amount of butyl carbitol. The total<br>
water removed was 210 g. After 30 minutes, the vacuum was released,<br>
and 40 g OT filter aid (diatomaceous earth) was added. The mineral was<br>
filtered by suction to give a clear, amber, mobile liquid which was<br>
analyzed to contain 29.7% barium by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
45.2% Overbased Amorphous Barium Oleate/Carbonate Powder<br>
A phenol-free overbased barium oleate/carbonate containing<br>
29.7% barium by weight (prepared by Example 10} was poured in a slow<br>
stream in 5 minutes into 1000 g of isopropyl alcohol under rapid stirring.<br>
The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 hour, and then<br>
filtered with suction, washed with 2x100 g of isopropyl alcohol, sucked<br>
as dry as possible then allowed to dry in air overnight. The product, an<br>
off-white powder, as analyzed to contain 45.2% barium by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
45.5% Overbased Amorphous Barium Oleate/Phenate/Carbonate Powder<br>
A phenol-containing overbased amorphous barium<br>
oleate/phenate/carbonate liquid containing 45.5% barium was prepared<br>
according to Example 10 with the addition of phenol to the reaction<br>
mixture, as, for example, disclosed in U.S. patent 5,830,935. 200 g of<br>
this overbased barium oleate/phenate/carbonate was added to 1000 g of<br>
rapidly stirred isopropyl alcohol at room temperature over a 5-minute<br>
period. The mixture was allowed to stir for 1 Vzhours, then was filtered<br>
with suction, washed 2x100 g of isopropyS alcohol, sucked as dry as<br>
possible, and allowed to dry in air. The product, a pink powder, was<br>
analyzed to contain 45.5% barium by weight.<br>
