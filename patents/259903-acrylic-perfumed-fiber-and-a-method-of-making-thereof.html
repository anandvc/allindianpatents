ACRYLIC PERFUMED FIBER AND A METHOD OF MAKING<br>
THEREOF<br><br><br>
ADITYA BIRLA SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD.<br>
an Indian Company of Aditya Birla Center, 2nd floor, C Wing, S. K. Ahire Marg, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a substance which is capable of being spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
Fibers are classified on the basis of their length such as short fibers or staple fiber and long fibers or filament fiber. The fibers can also be classified on the basis of their origin such as natural fibers and man-made fibers. The term natural fibers means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g. vegetable fibers or wood fibers. The other type of fibers is obtained from chemical substances. These are called man made fibers. They are rayon, polyester, nylon, acrylic (cashmilon) and the like.<br>
For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, the industrialization and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers containing at least 85% of acrylonitrile monomer. The acrylic fibers are prepared from a polymer Polyacrylonitrile which is obtained by free radical polymerisation with an average molecular weight of-100,000. Typical properties of acrylic fibers include, resistance<br>
2<br><br>
to moths, oils,  and chemicals. Furthermore, they are also resistant to<br>
deterioration from sunlight exposure.<br>
The process steps involved in the preparation of Acrylic fibers are as<br>
follows:<br>
The Polyacrylonitrile is dissolved in solvents like N,N-dirnethylformamide<br>
or aqueous sodium thiocyanate. Then it is metered through a multi-hole<br>
spinnerette and the resultant filaments are coagulated in an aqueous solution<br>
of the same solvent. The resultant filaments are washed, stretched, dried and<br>
crimped to obtain final acrylic fibers. Acrylic fibers are typically produced<br>
in a range of deniers from 1 to 15.<br>
Acrylic is lightweight, soft, and warm, with a wool-like feel. It dyes very<br>
well and has excellent colorfastness. It is resilient, retains its shape, and<br>
resists  shrinkage  and  wrinkles.  Acrylic  fibers  are  commonly used  in<br>
sweaters, hand-knitting yarns, rugs, awnings, boat covers, and beanies; the<br>
fiber is also used as a precursor for carbon fiber.<br>
From the spun or filament yarn, fabric is formed by knitting or weaving operations. Knitted fabrics can be made by using hooked needles to interlock one or more sets of yarns through a set of loops. The loops may be either loosely or closely constructed, depending on the purpose of the fabric. Knitted fabrics can be used for hosiery, underwear, sweaters, slacks, suits, coats, rugs and other home furnishings. Weaving is performed using either weft or warp processes.<br>
Some typical preparations that are involved in the weaving operations are warping, slashing or sizing. Sizing agents are added to the yarn by solution or pad/dry techniques. Differences in raw materials, processing chemicals,<br>
3<br><br>
fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for desired application. It is often desired that the acrylic fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable interest in developing such materials. In order to impart various desirable properties to the fabric as mentioned above to the fabric, several constituents with various properties are added. Such constituents include antimicrobial agents, deodorizing agents, antistatic agents, perfumes. Besides such specific constituents, generic constituents for improving overall quality of the fabric, such as sizing agents, antimicrobial constituents for increasing yarn softness and pliability are also added.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
US 7012053 discloses a process for producing treated fabric which involves application of composition, comprising fabric care additive, perfume, color restoring agent and antimicrobial agent by means of spraying, soaking or dipping.<br>
US 5656333 discloses a method of producing an absorbent nonwoven article which comprises coating of fibers with binder containing colorants, softeners, fragrances, fillers and bactericidal agents.<br>
US 5690922 discloses process for preparation of deodorizable fibers which involves  incorporation of powder composition containing  deodorizable<br>
4<br><br>
material such as photocatalyst, phosphate of a tetravalent metal and hydroxide of a divalent metal into the polymer.<br>
US 6335075 discloses a multilayer carpet having a deodorizing function. Deodorant is applied by spraying or foaming on one of the layers while it is kneaded on the other layers.<br>
Earlier known processes of incorporating such additives, as reported in the above mentioned patents/applications, mainly involved conventional methods like spraying, encapsulating, solvent spinning, chemical treatment, surface coating and embedding. However, these methods suffer from several disadvantages which include non-uniform and improper adhesion of additives onto the fiber material and gradual washing out of the additives over a period of time and which further affects the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
There is thus felt a need for a process of incorporating additives to fabric which overcomes these shortcomings.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide perfumed acrylic fibers, wherein at least one perfume constituent is incorporated in the body of the fiber.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents into acrylic fibers which ensures uniform distribution of the perfume constituent throughout the fiber length.<br>
5<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide perfumed acrylic fibers wherein the perfume constituents are retained in the acrylic product over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents to acrylic fibers which does not alter the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents to acrylic fibers such that inherent properties of the acrylic rayon fibers such as fiber strength, linear density, tenacity, heat resistance, dyeability and drying properties are not altered.<br>

Detailed Description:<br>
Acrylic fibers were the first viable manufactured fibers. The reason behind<br>
the most widespread use of these fibers lies in their versatility. Furthermore,<br>
these fibers also have peculiar ability to blend easily with many fibers which<br>
makes them the fibers of choice.<br>
Though Rayon fibers and fabrics made from them have many desirable<br>
properties, oftentimes, consumers expect performance characteristics beyond<br>
those for which rayon fibers were designed. In order to meet with these<br>
increasing expectations, various perfume constituents are incorporated in the<br>
acrylic fibers. There has been a considerable interest in developing such<br>
materials.<br>
There is enormous demand for acrylic fibers with intrinsic perfume.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is provided a perfumed acrylic<br>
formulation meant for manufacture of acrylic products comprising:<br>

N-400 nonylphenol 40-mole ethoxylate, Surfonic LF-7 (Alkyl<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether) , Surfonic LF-17 (ethoxylated and propoxylated<br>
linear primary 12-14 carbon number alcohol), Igepal CO-630 (nonylphenoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol,branched), Surfonic DNP-40	(dinonylphenol<br>
ethoxylate glycol ether).<br>
The non-ionic surfactant is selected such that the lipophilic portion of the non-ionic surfactant is compatible with the perfume constituent and the surfactant forms oil in water micro-emulsion. Surfactants with HLB values within the range of 9 to 40 are used. Preferably, non-ionic surfactants with HLB values more than 13 are used.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, the HLB value of the surfactant is between 16 and 40.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the perfume constituent, the solvent and the surfactant are processed to form micro-reservoirs which are embedded into the body of the formulation. The perfumed micro-reservoirs are eventually dispersed uniformly throughout the body of the fibers. The micro-reservoirs are discrete, nano-sized structures without any definite geometrical shape.<br>
Typically, the average mean size of the micro-reservoir is in the range of 5 nm to 2000 nm.<br>
The invention also extends to a perfume acrylic fiber, yarn and fabric manufactured from a formulation in accordance with this invention.<br>
19<br><br>
In accordance with this invention there is also provided a process for preparation of a perfume acrylic formulation meant for manufacture of acrylic products comprising the following steps:<br>
•	admixing a water-insoluble perfume constituent with a non-aqueous solvent followed by heating the resulting admixture to a temperature in the range of 25°C to 950C to obtain non-aqueous phase ;<br>
•	dissolving and stirring a surfactant, optionally with a co-surfactant, in water to obtain a aqueous phase;<br>
•	admixing and homogenizing the non-aqueous phase with the aqueous phase to obtain a micro-emulsion;<br>
•	dispersing the micro-emulsion throughout the mass of the acrylic polymer dope to obtain a preform mass wherein the perfume constituent is in the form of evenly dispersed micro-reservoirs.<br>
Typically, the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of 7 to 13.<br>
Typically, the amount of non-aqueous phase in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 40% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br>
Typically, the amount of surfactant in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 20% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br>
Typically, the proportion of perfume constituent in the acrylic product is in the range of 0.001 to 20% with respect to the mass of the acrylic product.<br>
Before arriving at the optimum concentration of the surfactant to be used, cloud point of the aqueous phase is determined. Furthermore, alkalinity of<br>
20<br><br>
the aqueous phase matches with that of the acrylic polymer dope thereby avoiding any drastic change in the alkalinity during the emulsification and homogenization step.<br>
Typically, the melted non-aqueous phase containing perfume constituent in a non-aqueous solvent along with aqueous phase containing surfactants is emulsified using high speed mixers such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier to form a micro-emulsion. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional perfume constituents, if desired.<br>
The active ingredients are released from the micro-reservoir into the acrylic matrix. The structure of micro-reservoir, acrylic and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the perfume constituent. The molecules of the volatile perfume constituents migrate from micro-reservoirs to the surrounding primarily by diffusion. The perfume constituent is released from the matrix in a controlled release manner.<br>
Preform mass is spun to fiber in a bath containing 12.5% of Sodium thiocyanate solution. The temperature of the bath is maintained at -2.5°C. Thereafter, the fiber is cold stretched, gel treated at pH 2.8 at 45°C, then hot stretch at 90°C.<br>
The void in the fibers is removed by treating the fiber at 125°C. Fiber is then relaxed and annealed at 120°C and then taken up for post-treatment.<br>
The acrylic fibers can be further subjected to post treatment to make fabric which typically involves:<br>
21<br><br>
o	Converting to Yarn in blend or pure<br>
o	Converting to Warp Beam<br>
o	Sizing<br>
o	Fabric Manufacturing- Weaving /Knitting<br>
o	Dyeing<br>
o	Finishing<br>
Alternatively, the filaments so obtained are further blended using standard equipment. The blended fibers are laid in to a web using standard equipment followed by Consolidation of the web to obtain Non-woven Acrylic Fabric.<br>
The acrylic product made from the formulation in accordance with this invention contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the mass which is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
A typical perfumed acrylic fiber as obtained by the process of this invention contains the releasable perfume constituent entrapped in the form of pockets. Said pockets are uniformly distributed throughout the length of the fiber. Upon microscopic examination, perfume constituent enriched acrylic fiber shows uniform distribution of pockets along the length of the acrylic fiber as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The resultant perfumed acrylic fabric is tested. Linear Density (Denier) of the acrylic Fibers is determined by using standard ASTM Test Method (D 1577). The denier of the standard acrylic fiber (acrylic fiber without any perfume constituents) and perfume enriched acrylic fiber remains the same. Thus addition of perfume does not change the linear density of the acrylic fibers.<br>
22<br><br>
Tensile strength and Young's modulus of acrylic fiber sample is tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM C1557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
Visual appearance of the perfume enriched fiber is evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remain the same in the perfume enriched acrylic fiber and the standard fiber. Incorporation of perfume constituent in accordance with this invention does not affect the visual appearance of the fiber.<br>
Feel of the fiber: The perfume enriched acrylic fiber as prepared in accordance with this invention offers the same feel effect as is observed in case of plain acrylic fiber without any perfume constituent (Also referred as standard).<br>
Another important concern in textile industry is dye-ability of the fabric, which is tested by comparing the dyeability of the perfume constituent enriched fabric and the standard acrylic fabric. Dyeability of the perfume enriched acrylic fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention remains the same as that of the standard acrylic fiber.<br>
Perfume retention test:<br>
Perfumed acrylic fabric before and after washes is tested for aroma or fragrance by using expert human panel. Fragrance of the perfumed acrylic fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention was perceived even after repeatedly washing the fabric and exposing it to sunlight and / or varying<br>
temperatures.<br>
23<br><br>

Testing procedures:<br>
The perfumed acrylic products as prepared in the above examples (1 to 10) were tested by using following test procedures;<br>
1)	Linear Density (Denier) of the acrylic fibers was determined by using<br>
standard ASTM Test Method (D 1577).<br>
The denier of the standard acrylic fiber (without any perfume constituents) and anti-microbial acrylic fibers as prepared in accordance with example 1B was found to be uniform(l .5 denier) irrespective of the type and quantity of the perfume constituent.<br>
2)	Tensile strength and Young's modulus of acrylic fiber samples were tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM C1557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
3)	Emulsion stability: The stability of micro-emulsions as prepared in the above examples, was evaluated by keeping the same under observation<br>
31<br><br>
in measuring  cylinders  for 3  days.  During  this period  no  phase separation was observed.<br>
4)	Feel of the fabric: The acrylic fabrics as prepared in the above examples and standard fabric (acrylic fabric without perfume constituents), were randomly given to twenty subjects and they were asked to evaluate the texture and feel of the fiber. The test fiber material was interchanged several times amongst the human subjects. Collective results as submitted by the human subjects confirmed that nobody could distinguish between the perfumed acrylic fabrics prepared in accordance with the Examples provided above and the standard fabric.<br>
5)	Dyeability: The perfumed acrylic fabrics as prepared in the above examples and the standard fabric as described above were dyed uniformly with reactive dyes. No noticeable difference as to the Dyeability of the two respective acrylic fabrics, with and without perfume constituent was reported.<br><br>
6)	Visual appearance of the perfumed acrylic fiber was evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remained the same(
7)	Perfume retention test:<br>
Twenty pieces of standard size 20cmX20cm cut out from the freshly prepared acrylic fiber as prepared in accordance with example 1B. Another set of Twenty pieces of the same size cut out of from the same<br>
32<br><br>
fiber were subjected to 20 hot water washes with the intermittent drying period of 2 hrs. The drying was carried out in natural sunlight at temperature within the range of 25 to 45°C The specimens so prepared were randomly distributed to human subjects for testing the aroma of the specimen. The specimen was interchanged amongst the subjects. The odor of the two respective acrylic fiber specimens was reported as perceivable and therefore it is concluded that the acrylic fiber specimen retained the perfume additive even after exposure to varying conditions.<br>
