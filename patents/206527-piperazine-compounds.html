The compounds of the invention are antagonists of tachykinins, including substance P and other neurokinins, both in vitro and in vivo and are thus of use in the treatment of conditions mediated by tachykinins, including substance P and other neurokinins.<br>
        NK-1-receptor binding affinity has  been determined  in vitro  by the<br>
compounds' ability to displace [3H] - substance P (SP) from recombinant<br>
.   human NK-j receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell<br>
membranes.<br>
CHO cell membranes were prepared by using a modification of the<br>
  method described by Dam T and Quirion R (Peptides, 7:855-864, 1986). Thus ligand binding was performed in 0.4 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM MnCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.5 nM [3H]Substance P (30-r56 Ci/mmol, Amersham), a final me'mbrane concentration of 25 ug of protein/ml, and the test compounds. The incubation proceeded at room<br>
  temperature for 40 miri. Non-specific binding was determined using excess of Substance P (1 uM) and represents about 6% of the total binding.<br>
Compounds of the invention were further characterised in a functional assay for the determination of their inhibitory effect Human-NK-1-CHO<br>
 cells were stimulated with Substance P and the receptor activation was<br>
evaluated	by	measuring	the	accumulation	of<br>
cytidinediphosphodiacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), which is the liponucleotide precursor of phosphatidylinositol diphosphate. CDP-DAG accumulates in the presence of Li+ as a consequence of the receptor mediated activation<br>
  of phospholipase C (PLC) (Godfrey, Biochem. J., 258:621-624, 1989). The method is described in detail by Ferraguti et al. (Mol. Cell. Neurosci., 5:269-276, 1994).<br>
The action of the compounds of the invention at the NK-1 receptor may be        determined by using conventional tests. Thus the ability to bind at the NK-1<br><br><br><br>
11<br><br>
receptor was determined using the gerbil foot tapping model as described by Rupniak &amp; Williams, Eur. J. of Pharmacol., 1994.<br>
Compounds of the invention have also been found to exhibit anxiolytic activity in conventional tests. For example in marmoset human threat test (Costall eta!., 1988).<br>
Compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of CNS disorders in particular in the treatment or prevention of major depressive   disorders including bipolar depression, unipolar depression, single or recurrent major depressive episodes with or without psychotic features, catatonic features, melancholic features, atypical features or postpartum onset, the treatment of anxiety and the treatment of panic disorders. Other mood disorders encompassed within the term major depressive disorders<br>

The affinity of the compound of the invention for NK1 receptor was determined using the NK-1-receptor binding affinity method measuring in vitro by the compounds^ ability to displace [3H] - substance P (SP) from recombinant human NK1j receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes. The affinity values are expressed as negative logarithm of the inhibition constant (XI) of displacer ligands (pKi).<br>

The ability of the compounds of the invention at the nk1 receptor may be determined using the gerbill foot tapping model as described by Rupniak &amp; Williams, Eur. Jour, 'of Pharmacol., 1994.<br>
The compound was administered orally and one hour later an NK1 agonist (e.g. delta-Amlnovaleryl6[Pro9.Me-Leu10]-substance P (7-11)) (3pmol in 5ul. icv) was infused directly in the cerebral ventricules of the animals. The duration of hind foot tapping induced by the NK1 agonist (e.g. delta-Aminovaleryl6[Pro9,Me-Leu10]-substance P (7-11)) was recorded continuosly for 3 min using a stopclock. The dose of the test compound required to inhibit by 50% the tapping induced by the NK1 agonist (e.g. delta-Aminovaleryl6[Pro9,Me-Leu10l-substance P (7-11)) expressed as mg/kg was referred as the ID50 values. Alternatively the compounds may be administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally.<br>
Representative results obtained for compounds of the invention when given by oral administration are given in the following table<br>
