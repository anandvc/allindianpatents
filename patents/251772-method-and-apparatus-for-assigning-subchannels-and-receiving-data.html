				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system<br>
supporting an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)<br>
scheme (hereinafter referred to as an "OFDMA communication system"), and in<br>
particular, to an apparatus and method for adaptively assigning subchannels.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system is in the<br>
process of being standardized to provide efficient interworking and integrated<br>
service between a wired communication network and a wireless communication<br>
network, beyond the simple wireless communication service that the previous-<br>
generation mobile communication systems provided. Accordingly, the technology<br>
required for transmitting a large volume of data at a same level available in the<br>
wired communication network must be developed for the new wireless<br>
communication network.<br>
In this context, many studies are being conducted on using an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme as a scheme for high-speed<br>
data transmission over wired/wireless channels in the 4G mobile communication<br>
system. The OFDM scheme, which transmits data using multiple carriers, is a<br>
special type of a Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM) scheme in which a serial<br>
symbol sequence is converted into parallel symbol sequences and the parallel<br>
symbol sequences are modulated with a plurality of mutually orthogonal<br>
subcarriers (or subcarrier channels) before being transmitted.<br>
The first MCM systems appeared in the late 1950's for military high<br>
frequency (HF) radio communication, and the OFDM scheme for overlapping<br>
orthogonal subcarriers was initially developed in the 1970's. In view of<br>
orthogonal modulation between multiple carriers, the OFDM scheme has<br>
limitations in its actual implementation. In 1971, Weinstein, et al. proposed that<br>
OFDM modulation/demodulation can be efficiently performed using Discrete<br>
Fourier Transform (DFT), which was a driving force behind the development of<br><br>
the OFDM scheme. Also, the introduction of a guard interval and a cyclic prefix<br>
as the guard interval further mitigates the adverse effects of multipath propagation<br>
and delay spread on the systems. As a result, the OFDM scheme has been widely<br>
used for digital data communication technologies such as digital audio<br>
broadcasting (DAB), digital TV broadcasting, wireless local area network<br>
(WLAN), and wireless asynchronous transfer mode (WATM).<br>
Although the hardware complexity was an obstacle to widespread<br>
implementation of the OFDM scheme, recent advances in digital signal<br>
processing technology including fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform (IFFT) have enabled the OFDM scheme to be implemented in a<br>
less complex manner.<br>
The OFDM scheme, similar to an existing Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (FDM) scheme, boasts of an optimum transmission efficiency in<br>
high-speed data transmission because it can transmit data on subcarriers, while<br>
being able to maintain orthogonality among them. The optimum transmission<br>
efficiency is further attributed to good frequency use efficiency and robustness<br>
against multipath fading in the OFDM scheme. More specifically, overlapping<br>
frequency spectrums lead to efficient frequency use and robustness against<br>
frequency selective fading and multipath fading. The OFDM scheme reduces the<br>
effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) by use of guard intervals and enables the<br>
design of a simple equalizer hardware structure. Furthermore, because the OFDM<br>
scheme is robust against impulse noise, it is increasingly popular in<br>
communication systems.<br>
The OFDMA scheme is a Multiple Access scheme based on the OFDM<br>
scheme. In the OFDMA scheme, subcarriers in one OFDM symbol are distributed<br>
to a plurality of users, or subscriber stations. A communication system using the<br>
OFDMA scheme includes an IEEE 802.16a communication system and an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. The IEEE 802.16a communication system is a<br>
fixed-Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system using the<br>
OFDMA scheme. The IEEE 802.16e communication system is a system that<br>
provides for the mobility of subscriber stations in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system. Currently, the IEEE 802.16a communication system and<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system both use 2048-point IFFT and 1702<br>
subcarriers. The IEEE 802.16a communication system and the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system use 166 subcarriers from among the 1702 subcarriers as<br><br>
pilot subcarriers, and use the remaining 1536 subcarriers, not including the 166<br>
subcarriers, as data subcarriers.<br>
The 1536 data subcarriers are divided into 32 subchannels, each having<br>
48 data subcarriers. The subchannels are assigned to a plurality of users according<br>
to system conditions. The term "subchannel" refers to a channel comprised of a<br>
plurality of subcarriers. Herein, each subchannel is comprised of 48 subcarriers.<br>
The OFDMA communication system distributes all subcarriers, particularly, data<br>
subcarriers used over the entire frequency band, thereby acquiring a frequency<br>
diversity gain.<br>
A frequency hopping (hereinafter referred to as "FH") scheme is a<br>
scheme of changing subcarriers assigned to a specific subscriber station, and an<br>
FH-OFDM scheme is a scheme that combines the FH scheme and the OFDM<br>
scheme. A system employing the FH-OFDM scheme (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
"FH-OFDM system") uses the FH scheme in hopping frequency bands of the<br>
subcarriers assigned to the subscriber stations. Therefore, the FH-OFDM system<br>
also distributes all of the subcarriers, particularly, data subcarriers used over the<br>
entire frequency band, thereby acquiring a frequency diversity gain.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a communication system and the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system divide a broadband of, for example, 10MHz into<br>
subchannels only in a frequency domain. As indicated above, the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system and the IEEE 802.16e communication system use a 2048-<br>
point IFFT and use 1702 subcarriers per OFDM symbol. When subchannels are<br>
assigned using Reed Solomon (RS) sequences, which secures an excellent inter-<br>
subchannel collision characteristic in a multi-cell environment, it is possible to<br>
identify about 40 cells (e.g., 41*40=1640). For example, when a Reed Solomon<br>
sequence defined in a Galois Field Q is used, the number of available subcarriers<br>
is defined as Q(Q-1). When about 1600 subcarriers are used as in the 802.16a/e<br>
system, 41 is selected from among 37, 41, and 43 which are prime numbers near<br>
to 40, so that a system using 1640 subcarriers is generated. However, the<br>
802.16a/e system uses 48 for the number subcarriers per subchannel and thus has<br>
an inferior property in collision between subchannels. The Galois Field will be<br>
described later in detail.<br>
However, in order to facilitate network design along with the<br>
development of communication systems, it is necessary to increase the number of<br><br>
identifiable cells up to 100. The OFDMA scheme has limitations in generating<br>
subchannels only in a frequency domain in terms of the number of identifiable<br>
cells.<br>
Further, a Flash-OFDM scheme using a narrowband of 1.25MHz uses<br>
128-point IFFT, and defines 113 hopping sequences that hop different subcarriers<br>
for one period comprised of 113 OFDM symbols, as a basic resource assignment<br>
unit. A communication system supporting the Flash-OFDM scheme (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "Flash-OFDM communication system") defines different hopping<br>
frequencies for 113 cells in designing networks, thereby making it possible to<br>
identify 113 different cells. However, the Flash-OFDM scheme, being a<br>
narrowband-only scheme, cannot contribute to the required capacity increase.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail herein below with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following<br><br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention assigns subchannels in a time-frequency 2-<br>
dimensional domain in a communication system using an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
"OFDMA communication system")- Accordingly, the present invention increases<br>
the number of identifiable cells, or base stations, in the OFDMA communication<br>
system, and minimizes collision between subchannels used in neighbor base<br>
stations. Each base station can manage one cell or a plurality of cells. However,<br>
for ease of description, it will be assumed herein that each base station manages<br>
only one cell.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a first transmitter in an OFDMA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a first transmitter of the OFDMA communication system<br>
includes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) inserter 111, an encoder 113, a symbol<br>
mapper 115, a subchannel assigner 117, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 119, a<br>
pilot symbol inserter 121, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) block 123, a<br>
parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 125, a guard interval inserter 127, a digital-to-<br>
analog (D/A) converter 129, and a radio frequency (RF) processor 131.<br>
When there are user data bits and control data bits to transmit, the user<br>
data bits and the control data bits are input to the CRC inserter 111. Herein, the<br>
user data bits and the control data bits will be referred to as "information data<br>
bits." The CRC inserter 111 inserts CRC bits into the information data bits, and<br>
outputs CRC-inserted information data bits to the encoder 113. The encoder 113<br>
encodes the signal output from the CRC inserter 111 using a predetermined<br>
coding technique, and outputs the encoded signal to the symbol mapper 115.<br>
Preferably, turbo coding or convolutional coding is used as the coding technique.<br>
The symbol mapper 115 modulates the coded bits output from the<br>
encoder 113 into modulation symbols using a predetermined modulation<br>
technique, and outputs the modulation symbols to the subchannel assigner 117.<br>
Preferably, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) or 16-ary quadrature amplitude<br>
modulation (16QAM) is used as the modulation technique. The subchannel<br>
assigner 117 assigns subchannels by receiving the modulation symbols output<br>
from the symbol mapper 115, and outputs the subchannel-assigned modulation<br><br>
symbols to the serial-to-parallel converter 119. An operation of assigning<br>
subchannels in the subchannel assigner 117 is performed in a subchannel<br>
assignment method proposed by the present invention, which will be described in<br>
more detail herein below.<br>
The serial-to-parallel converter 119 parallel-converts the subchannel-<br>
assigned serial modulation symbols output from the subchannel assigner 117, and<br>
outputs the parallel-converted modulation symbols to the pilot symbol inserter<br>
121. The pilot symbol inserter 121 inserts pilot symbols into the parallel-<br>
converted modulation symbols output from the serial-to-parallel converter 119,<br>
and outputs the pilot-inserted modulation symbols to the IFFT block 123.<br>
The IFFT block 123 performs N-point IFFT on the pilot-inserted<br>
modulation symbols output from the pilot symbol inserter 121, and outputs the<br>
IFFT-processed modulation symbols to the parallel-to-serial converter 125. The<br>
parallel-to-serial converter 125 serial-converts the IFFT-processed parallel<br>
modulation symbols, and outputs the serial-converted modulation symbols to the<br>
guard interval inserter 127. The guard interval inserter 127 inserts a guard interval<br>
signal into the serial-converted modulation symbols, and outputs the guard<br>
interval-inserted modulation symbols to the digital-to-analog converter 129. The<br>
guard interval is inserted to remove interference between a previous OFDM<br>
symbol transmitted at a previous OFDM symbol time and a current OFDM<br>
symbol to be transmitted at a current OFDM symbol time in an OFDM<br>
communication system. Generally, null data is inserted into the guard interval. In<br>
this case, however, when a receiver incorrectly estimates a start point of an<br>
OFDM symbol, interference occurs between subcarriers, causing an increase in<br>
incorrect estimation rates for the received OFDM symbol. Therefore, a cyclic<br>
prefix method or a cyclic postfix method is used. In the cyclic prefix method, a<br>
predetermined number of last samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain are<br>
copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol, and in the cyclic postfix method,<br>
a predetermined number of first samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain<br>
are copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital-to-analog converter 129 analog-converts the signal output<br>
from the guard interval inserter 127, and outputs the analog-converted signal to<br>
the RF processor 131. The RF processor 131, including a filter and a front-end<br>
unit, RF-processes the signal output from the digital-to-analog converter 129 such<br><br>
that the signal, and transmits the RF-processed signal over the air via a<br>
transmission antenna.<br>
(1) Subchannel Assignment in a Time-Frequency 2-Dimensional Domain<br>
Indexes of the subcarriers included in a subchannel are assigned using a<br>
Reed Solomon (RS) sequence, and the subchannel is generated using subcarriers<br>
corresponding to the assigned subcarrier indexes. All subcarriers included in the<br>
OFDMA communication system are divided into (Q-1) groups, and each of the<br>
(Q-1) groups has Q consecutive subcarriers.<br>
The Reed Solomon sequence is defined in a Galois Field. A Galois Field<br>
(Q) is comprised of Q elements of {0,1, 2,—,Q-1}. Here, Q denotes a size of the<br>
Galois Field, and when the Q is a prime number, an addition operation and a<br>
multiplication operation in the Galois Field (Q) are defined as shown below in<br>
Equation (1).<br><br>
A sequence S defined in the Galois Field (Q) is a subchannel sequence,<br>
assigned to each of the (Q-1) groups, indicating positions of subcarriers included<br>
in a subchannel. Indexes of the subcarriers included in a subchannel are expressed<br>
in Equation (2).<br><br>
In Equation (2), 'i' denotes a group index indicating a particular group<br>
from among all of the (Q-1) groups of the OFDMA communication system. The<br>
group index 'i' has any one of the values 0, 1, •••, Q-2. Further, S(i) denotes an<br>
(i+1)th element in a sequence S, and represents the positions of the subcarriers in<br>
the corresponding group.<br>
If the sequence of Equation (2), i.e., the sequence representing the<br>
indexes of the subcarriers included in a subchannel, is defined, a subchannel<br>
corresponding to the sequence can also be defined. For example, if it is assumed<br>
that the number of all subcarriers of the OFDMA communication system is 42 of<br>
{0,1,2,—,41}, the 42 subcarriers can be divided into 6 groups. In addition, 6<br>
subcarriers included in a particular subchannel can be assigned using a length-6<br><br>
sequence. That is, if indexes of {3,2,6,4,5,1} are given for a subchannel sequence<br>
S, a corresponding subchannel is generated using sequences having indexes<br>
{3,9,20,25,33,36} of subcarriers.<br>
In addition, the permutation and the offset for a basic sequence are used<br>
for identifying a particular base station and the subchannels in the base station.<br>
Herein, the basic sequence is defined as S0, and the basic sequence S0 is expressed<br>
as shown in Equation (3).<br><br>
In Equation (3), a denotes a primitive element of the Galois Field (Q)<br>
(α≠1 for m<q-1 if a size q of the galois field is></q-1>
primitive element a becomes 3 and S0 = {3,3 ,3 ,...,3 ,3 } mod 7 = {3,2,6,4,5,1}.<br>
Here, the basic sequence S0 represents a sequence assigned to a subchannel #0 for<br>
a reference base station from among a plurality of base stations included in the<br>
OFDMA communication system. It is assumed herein that the reference base<br>
station is a base station #0 and the base station #0 becomes a first base station<br>
from among the base stations constituting the OFDMA communication system.<br>
Also, the subchannel #0 becomes a first subchannel from among the Q<br>
subchannels.<br>
A sequence Sm assigned to a cell #m is a sequence determined by<br>
permuting the basic sequence S0 m times. The sequence Sm is expressed as shown<br>
in Equation (4).<br><br>
In Equation (4), Sm denotes a sequence assigned to a subchannel #0 of a<br>
base station #m.<br>
In addition, a sequence Sm,β for defining subchannels in the base station<br>
#m become a sequence determined by adding an offset β to a sequence Sm<br>
assigned to a subchannel #0 of the cell #m. The sequence Sm,β for defining<br>
subchannels in the base station #m is expressed in Equation (5) below.<br><br><br>
In Equation (5), GF(Q) denotes Galois Field(Q).<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to assign subchannels to all of the (Q-1) base<br>
stations of the OFDMA communication system. Therefore, it is possible to obtain<br>
Q subchannel sequences for each of the (Q-1) base stations. The obtained<br>
subchannel sequences are advantageous in that a maximum of only one<br>
subchannel may possibly collide between neighbor base stations, thereby<br>
preventing a deterioration in system performance due to subchannel collision.<br>
Referring to Table 1 and Table 2, a description will now be made of base<br>
station sequences for a subchannel #0 and sequences for designating subchannels<br>
in a base station #0, when a size Q of the Galois Field is 7 (Galois Field (Q)=7), a<br>
primitive element of the Galois Field is 3 (α=3), and basic sequence S0 =<br>
{3,2,6,4,5,1}.<br><br>
Table 1 illustrates sequences for assigning a subchannel #0 of different<br>
cells using permutation, and Table 2 illustrates sequences for assigning<br><br>
subchannels in a base station #0 by adding an offset to the indexes of the<br>
subchannels in a base station. As illustrated in Table 1, a maximum of only one<br>
subchannel may possibly collide, thereby preventing a reduction in the system<br>
performance due to subchannel collision. However, unlike this, it is possible to<br>
identify the subchannels in a base station by permuting a basic sequence as<br>
illustrated in Table 1, and it is also possible to generate different sequences for<br>
identifying the base stations by adding an offset to the basic sequence as<br>
illustrated in Table 2.<br>
In a cellular communication system in which a frequency reuse rate is 1,<br>
it is necessary to increase the total number of identifiable base stations in the<br>
system to facilitate the installation of the base stations when designing the<br>
networks. In order to increase the number of identifiable base stations, it is<br>
necessary to increase a value Q of the Galois Field (Q). In order to increase the<br>
number of identifiable base stations, the present invention proposes a 2-<br>
dimensional subchannel assignment method considering not only a frequency<br>
domain but also a time domain. For example, assuming that 97*16=1552<br>
subcarriers are transmitted per OFDM symbol, if six OFDM symbols are used as<br>
one subcarrier assignment unit, it can be determined that 97*16*6=97*96 data<br>
subcarriers are used. In this case, if the subchannel sequence is defined on the<br>
Galois Field (97), 97 subchannels can be assigned in each of 96 cells. A basic<br>
sequence S0 using a primitive element of 5 on the Galois Field (97) can be<br>
calculated by substituting Q=97 and a=5 in Equation (3), and the basic sequence<br>
S0 is expressed as shown below in Equation (6).<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a process of assigning subchannels in a<br>
time-frequency 2-dimensional domain according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Before a description of FIG. 2 is given, it will be assumed for the<br>
example herein that 96 base stations can be identified in an OFDMA<br>
communication system and the subcarriers are assigned such that 97 subchannels<br>
can be identified for each of the 96 base stations. That is, as illustrated in FIG. 2,<br><br>
97*96 subcarriers are divided into 96 groups for 6 OFDM symbol periods in a<br>
time-frequency domain, and 97 consecutive subcarriers are arranged in each of<br>
the 96 groups. In FIG. 2, the rows denote indexes of subcarriers, and the columns<br>
denote symbol indexes of OFDM symbols in a time domain.<br>
In FIG. 2, because a size Q of the Galois Field is 97 (Q=97), a sequence<br>
({Sm,β}, for 0≤m≤95 and 0≤β≤96) for defining subchannels in a base station #m<br>
can be generated using Equations (4) and (5) and the basic sequence S0 of<br>
Equation (6). As a result, 97 subchannels can be assigned to each of 96 base<br>
stations.<br>
In the OFDMA communication system, if Q(Q-1) subcarriers in multiple<br>
OFDM symbol period are used, N groups are generated using Q*N subcarriers in<br>
on OFDM symbol, and if (Q-1)/N OFDM symbols are used, indexes of<br>
subcarriers constituting each of the subchannels are expressed as shown in<br>
Equation (7)<br><br>
In Equation (7), └x┘ represents a maximum integer, which is less than or<br>
equal to a value 'x'. In FIG. 2, because Q=97 and N=16, the group index 'i' has<br>
any one of the values of 0 to Q-2, i.e., 0 to 95, and the symbol index 'n' has any<br>
one of the values of 0 to 5. For example, subcarrier indexes for a subchannel #0<br>
of a base station #0 are<br>
Symbol 0: 5, 122, 222, 334, 409, 493, 622, 685, 806, 926, 1041, 1131,<br>
1193,1309, 1404, 1491<br>
Symbol 1: 83, 124, 232, 384, 465, 579, 664, 701, 789, 938, 1004, 1140,<br>
1238, 1340, 1365, 1490<br>
Symbol 2: 78, 99, 204, 341, 444, 571, 624, 695, 856, 885, 1030, 1076,<br>
1209,1292, 1416, 1551<br>
Symbol 3: 92, 169, 263, 345, 464, 574, 639, 770, 843, 917, 996, 1100,<br>
1232, 1310, 1409, 1516<br>
Symbol 4: 14, 167, 253, 295, 408, 488, 597, 754, 860, 905, 1033, 1091,<br>
1187,1279,1448,1517<br>
Symbol 5: 19, 192, 281, 338, 429, 496, 637, 760, 793, 958, 1007, 1155,<br>
1216, 1327, 1397, 1456<br><br>
If the subcarriers are assigned in this manner, a collision might only occur<br>
in a maximum of only one subchannel from among the subchannels belonging to<br>
different cells as described above, and the collision rate is much lower than that in<br>
the existing communication systems. For example, the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system can assign 32 subchannels for each cell, and subchannels<br>
from different cells suffer collision in 0 to 5 subcarrier positions. When<br>
subcarriers are assigned as described in the present invention, the number of<br>
collisions between subcarriers constituting subchannels is reduced to 0 or 1.<br>
For example, when the Reed Solomon sequence is used, because each<br>
subchannel has (Q-1) subcarriers and the number of collisions of subcarriers<br>
constituting subchannels for different cells is a maximum of 1, a ratio of collided<br>
subcarriers becomes a maximum of 1/(Q-1) and this value is reduced as the value<br>
Q increases. Therefore, the time-frequency 2-dimensional subcarrier assignment<br>
scheme proposed in the present invention can advantageously increase the<br>
number of identifiable cells and minimize a ratio of collided subcarriers.<br>
(2) Subchannel Assignment for Data Transmission<br>
A transmitter, or a base station, of the OFDMA communication system<br>
transmits data by assigning a part of one subchannel or at least one subchannel<br>
according to a decoding delay time and the amount of transmission data. For<br>
example, for the data transmission, a total of Q data assignment units can be<br>
generated by inserting the transmission data on a subchannel basis. Here, the<br>
"data assignment unit" refers to a resource assignment unit using the same<br>
channel coding scheme and modulation scheme. It will be assumed that 1/2 turbo<br>
coding is used as the channel coding scheme and QPSK is used as the modulation<br>
scheme.<br>
Generally, a coding gain increases as a length of a codeword becomes<br>
longer. For example, if a size of information bits included in the codeword<br>
becomes greater than 1000 bits, performance saturation occurs. Therefore, when<br>
96 subcarriers are used per subchannel and QPSK and 1/2 channel coding are<br>
used as a modulation scheme and a coding scheme, channel coding should be<br>
performed on about every 10 subchannels in order to maximize a coding gain.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a process of assigning subchannels for<br>
data transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention. However,<br>
before a description of FIG. 3 is given, as indicated above, it will also be assumed<br><br>
herein that 96 base stations can be identified in an OFDM A communication<br>
system, and the subcarriers are assigned such that 97 subchannels can be<br>
identified for each of the 96 base stations. FIG. 3 illustrates an example where<br>
subchannels are properly assigned according to their objects when the number of<br>
identifiable subchannels in one cell is 97, i.e., Q=97.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a unit rectangle is comprised of 16 subcarriers, and<br>
the unit rectangles are grouped for a 6-OFDM symbol period in a time axis,<br>
thereby generating one subchannel, which is represented by Td. Here, a unit<br>
rectangle representing 16 subcarriers, which are partial subcarriers included in the<br>
subchannel, will be referred to as a "subchannel unit." One subchannel includes 6<br>
subchannel units.<br>
When there is a large amount of transmission data, two or more<br>
subchannels can be grouped to transmit the data. In FIG. 3, the subchannels used<br>
for the data transmission are represented by Tb. That is, 4 subchannels of a<br>
subchannel 93 (SC 93) to a subchannel 96 (SC 96) are used to transmit the data.<br>
The maximum number of collisions between the subcarriers included in the<br>
subchannel unit is equal to the number of subchannel indexes used in a frequency<br>
domain. For the subchannel represented by Td and the partial subchannel (3<br>
subchannel units) represented by Ts, the number of subcarrier collisions between<br>
neighbor cells is a maximum of 1, and for the subchannel units of different<br>
subchannels represented by Tc and the subchannels represented by Tb, the<br>
maximum number of collisions can become a maximum of 3 or 4.<br>
A description will now be made herein below of a relationship between<br>
the maximum number of collisions for each subchannel and a decoding delay.<br>
The subchannels represented by Td and the subchannel units of different<br>
subchannels represented by Tc use the same area, i.e., the same number of<br>
subcarriers, and for the subchannels represented by Td, a maximum of one<br>
collision with subchannels Td of neighbor cells occurs and a decoding delay<br>
becomes 6 OFDM symbols. For the subchannel units of different subchannels<br>
represented by Tc, a maximum of three collisions with subchannel units of<br>
different subchannels Tc of neighbor cells occurs and a decoding delay becomes 2<br>
OFDM symbols.<br>
More specifically, in a 2-dimensional domain of a subchannel index SC<br>
and a time index t, a trade-off relation exists between the maximum number of<br><br>
collisions for subcarriers constituting the subchannel unit and a decoding delay.<br>
When data is transmitted for a time period that is shorter than a 6-OFDM symbol<br>
period, a coding rate must be increased. When subchannel units of different<br>
subchannels represented by Tc, i.e., a subchannel #3, a subchannel #4, and a<br>
subchannel #5, are used for 2 OFDM symbols, and a subchannel unit represented<br>
by Ts, i.e., a subchannel #91, is used for 3 OFDM symbols, it is effective to<br>
transmit data, which is relatively short in length and needs a short decoding delay.<br>
For example, the data that is relatively short in length and needs a short decoding<br>
delay includes paging channel data. As described above, how to use a subchannel<br>
in a 2-dimensional domain of a subchannel index SC and a time index t, i.e.,<br>
which subchannel is to be assigned for transmission of particular data, is<br>
determined according to how a control channel and a data channel are formed in<br>
the OFDMA communication system.<br>
(3) Subchannel Assignment Scenario in Cellular Environment<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a subcarrier assignment procedure<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, in step<br>
411, a base station initializes parameters necessary for assigning subcarriers, i.e.,<br>
a parameter Q representing a size of the Galois Field, a parameter N representing<br>
the number of groups in one OFDM symbol, and a parameter a representing a<br>
primitive element of the Galois Field(Q). Further, the base station generates a<br>
basic sequence S0 using the initialized parameters Q, N, and a. A process of<br>
generating the basic sequence S0 has been described above with reference to FIG.<br>
3.<br>
In step 413, the base station generates a sequence {Sm,β} for defining the<br>
subchannels in a base station to which the subcarriers should be assigned, for<br>
example, a base station #m. A process of generating a sequence {Sm,β} for<br>
defining subchannels in a base station #m, as described with reference to<br>
Equation (4) and Equation (5), includes a first step of generating a sequence Sm<br>
obtained by permuting the basic sequence S0 generated in step 411 m times, and a<br>
second step of generating the sequence {Sm,β} for defining subchannels in the<br>
base station #m. The process of generating the sequence {Sm,β} for defining the<br>
subchannels in the base station #m has been described above with reference to<br>
Equation (4) and Equation (5). The base station can perform the operation of step<br>
413 each time a corresponding situation occurs, or according to corresponding<br>
data read from a data table in which situation data is previously stored.<br><br>
In step 415, the base station assigns the subchannels for the data<br>
transmission considering the transmission data. Here, the base station assigns<br>
subchannels to be used for the data transmission using the rule described in<br>
conjunction with Equation (7), and a detailed description thereof will be omitted<br>
herein.<br>
(4)	Pilot Channel Generation Method in Cellular Environment<br>
Generally, in a cellular communication system, the pilot subcarriers are<br>
used for channel estimation and cell identification, and the present invention<br>
proposes a scheme for using a part of the subchannels as pilot channels. In the<br>
OFDMA communication system, in order to maintain a collision characteristic<br>
between subchannels, positions of the subcarriers constituting each of the<br>
subchannels should not be changed even after the pilot subcarriers are inserted<br>
into the subchannels.<br>
Therefore, the present invention proposes a scheme for using some of the<br>
subchannels defined in a time-frequency 2-dimensional domain as pilot channels.<br>
When some of the subchannels are used as pilot channels, a maximum of one<br>
collision of the subcarriers occurs between the subchannels assigned to the pilot<br>
channels, such that the proposed scheme is very effective for a cellular system in<br>
which a frequency reuse rate is 1. In addition, a subscriber station can identify<br>
cells depending on a pattern of the pilot subcarriers during an initial cell search or<br>
handoff.<br>
Further, the subscriber station can determine a relative signal level of a<br>
neighbor cell using the pilot subcarriers. That is, because positions of pilot<br>
subcarriers are different for each cell, the subscriber station can perform a cell<br>
search depending on the positions of the boosted pilot subcarriers rather than the<br>
data subcarriers. Here, the pilot subcarriers are boosted by 3 to 6[dB] over the<br>
data subcarriers, enabling the subscriber station to easily identify the pilot<br>
subcarriers. That is, the pilot signal becomes a kind of a reference signal for base<br>
station identification and channel estimation.<br>
(5)	subchannel assignment scheme for acquisition of diversity gain<br>
In the OFDMA communication system, the same codeword as a<br>
previously transmitted codeword may be retransmitted at a next point in time, i.e.,<br>
the same codeword as a previously transmitted codeword may be separated in<br>
time domain and retransmitted as an individual signal, or the same codeword may<br><br>
be repeatedly transmitted at the same point in time. For example, the OFDMA<br>
communication system employs a preamble sequence for the acquisition of the<br>
synchronization between a base station and a subscriber station and the<br>
codewords having the same length are repeated in the preamble sequence.<br>
Therefore, the same code word may be repeatedly transmitted as described above<br>
in the OFDMA system. Also, when a previously transmitted codeword was<br>
erroneous, the same code may be retransmitted.<br>
The present invention proposes a subchannel assignment scheme for the<br>
acquisition of a diversity gain in a time domain and a frequency domain for the<br>
cases of retransmitting or repeatedly transmitting the same codeword as described<br>
above. Specifically, in order to acquire the diversity gain, the present invention<br>
employs a subchannel having a structure which enables the bits of each of the<br>
repetitive same codewords to be transmitted by subcarriers of different subcarrier<br>
groups. Further, in order to acquire the diversity gain, the present invention<br>
employs a subchannel having a structure which enables bits of a retransmitted<br>
codeword to be transmitted by a subcarrier of a subcarrier group that is different<br>
from the subcarrier group to which the subcarrier having carried the previously<br>
transmitted codeword belongs.<br>
According to the present invention, in order to acquire the diversity gain,<br>
a subcarrier group of subcarriers is randomly set whenever a subchannel is<br>
generated by the subcarriers, as different from the subchannel generation method<br>
described above with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
In other words, in the subchannel generation method described above<br>
with reference to FIG. 2, indexes of the subcarrier groups to which each of the 96<br>
subcarriers constituting a subchannel β belongs when the subchannel β is assigned<br>
for a predetermined reference period of time (e.g. 6 OFDM symbol periods as<br>
shown in FIG. 2) to a predetermined base station at a predetermined point in time<br>
are the same as indexes of subcarrier groups to which each of the 96 subcarriers<br>
constituting a subchannel β belongs when the subchannel β is assigned at a point<br>
in time just next to the predetermined point in time.<br>
In contrast, according to the present invention, indexes of subcarrier<br>
groups are randomly interleaved, so that indexes of subcarrier groups to which<br>
each of the 96 subcarriers constituting a subchannel β belongs when the<br>
subchannel β is assigned at a predetermined point in time become different from<br><br>
indexes of subcarrier groups to which each of the 96 subcarriers constituting the<br>
subchannel β belongs when the subchannel β is assigned at a point in time just<br>
next to the predetermined point in time.<br>
For example, if the indexes of subcarrier groups of the 96 subcarriers<br>
constituting a subchannel β assigned at a predetermined time point are 0, 1,2, 3,<br>
..., 93, 94, and 95, the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the 96 subcarriers<br>
constituting the subchannel β assigned at a point in time just next to the<br>
predetermined point in time are controlled to be 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 94, 95, and 0. For<br>
another example, if the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the 96 subcarriers<br>
constituting a subchannel β assigned at a predetermined point in time are 0, 1,2, 3,<br>
..., 93, 94, and 95, the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the 96 subcarriers<br>
constituting the subchannel β assigned at a point in time just next the<br>
predetermined point in time are controlled to be 3, 11, 1,7, ..., 90, 78, and 36.<br>
In the first example, the subchannel assignment is performed by cyclic-<br>
shifting the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the subcarriers constituting the<br>
subchannel to acquire the diversity gain. In contrast, in the second example, the<br>
subchannel assignment is performed by randomly generating the indexes of the<br>
subcarrier groups of the subcarriers constituting the subchannel to acquire the<br>
diversity gain.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the indexes of the<br>
subcarrier groups of the subcarriers constituting the subchannel are changed<br>
whenever the subchannel is assigned, so as to acquire the diversity gain.<br>
Instead of changing the indexes of the subcarrier groups whenever the<br>
subchannel is assigned as described above, an interleaver may be used within the<br>
scope of the present invention. That is to say, a subchannel may be assigned<br>
according to the method described with reference to FIG. 2 and the indexes of the<br>
subcarrier groups of the subcarriers constituting the subchannel may then be<br>
interleaved by an interleaver (not shown), so as to acquire the diversity gain.<br>
Specifically, an interleaver may be interposed between the subchannel assigner<br>
117 and the serial-to-parallel converter 119 shown in FIG. 1, so that the<br>
interleaver interleaves the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the subcarriers<br>
constituting the subchannel having been assigned by the subchannel assigner 117.<br><br>
In short, bits of the same codeword must be transmitted by the subcarriers<br>
belonging to different subcarrier groups in order to acquire diversity gain in a<br>
time domain and a frequency domain when the same codeword is retransmitted or<br>
repetitively transmitted as described above. In such a case, the codeword is<br>
usually interleaved at a bit level to acquire the desired diversity. However, the<br>
present invention proposes a method of changing the group indexes as shown in<br>
FIG. 2 for every subchannel in the subchannel assigner 117. This operation can be<br>
explained as group index interleaving and a typical interleaver used in channel<br>
coding may be used for such a group index interleaving.<br>
For example, when a co-prime interleaver is used as the interleaver, a<br>
subcarrier group index of the k-th subcarrier included in the subchannel β changes<br>
into ∏(k), which can be expressed by Equation (8).<br><br>
In equation (8), each of a and b should be an integer prime to (Q-1), i.e.,<br>
an integer having a greatest common measure of 1 with respect to (Q-1). Further,<br>
the same effect can be obtained even when the subchannel β and the variable k<br>
exchange their functions in Equation (8).<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a second transmitter in an OFDMA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a second transmitter of the OFDMA communication system<br>
includes a CRC inserter 511, an encoder 513, a symbol mapper 515, a subchannel<br>
assigner 517, an interleaver 519, a serial-to-parallel converter 521, a pilot symbol<br>
inserter 523, an IFFT block 525, a parallel-to-serial converter 527, a guard<br>
interval inserter 529, a digital-to-analog converter 531, and an RF processor 533.<br>
The CRC inserter 511, the encoder 513, the symbol mapper 515, the serial-to-<br>
parallel converter 521, the pilot symbol inserter 523, the IFFT block 525, the<br>
parallel-to-serial converter 527, the guard interval inserter 529, the digital-to-<br>
analog converter 531, and the RF processor 533 have the same constructions as<br>
those of the CRC inserter 111, the encoder 113, the symbol mapper 115, the<br>
serial-to-parallel converter 119, the pilot symbol inserter 121, the IFFT block 123,<br>
the parallel-to-serial converter 125, the guard interval inserter 127, the digital-to-<br>
analog converter 129, and the radio frequency processor 131, so detailed<br>
description of them will be omitted here.<br><br>
However, in the second transmitter shown in FIG. 5, the subchannel<br>
assigner 517 may change the subcarrier groups of the subcarriers constituting the<br>
subchannel whenever it assigns the subchannel, in order to acquire the desired<br>
diversity gain. Otherwise, the subchannel assigner 517 may assign the subchannel<br>
in the same way as that by the subchannel assigner 117 of FIG. 1 and the<br>
interleaver 519 may interleave the indexes of the subcarrier groups of the<br>
subcarriers constituting the subchannel assigned by the subchannel assigner 517.<br>
As is understood from the foregoing description, the present invention<br>
enables subchannel assignment for maximizing the number of identifiable base<br>
stations in the OFDMA communication system. In addition, the subchannel<br>
assignment according to the present invention prevents a reduction in system<br>
performance due to the subchannel collisions by minimizing a collision rate<br>
between the subchannels between neighbor base stations. Furthermore, the<br>
present invention maximizes efficiency for cell search and channel estimation by<br>
using some of the assigned subchannels as pilot channels. Moreover, the present<br>
invention can acquire diversity gain by changing the subcarrier groups of the<br>
subcarriers constituting a subchannel whenever the subchannel is assigned.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
