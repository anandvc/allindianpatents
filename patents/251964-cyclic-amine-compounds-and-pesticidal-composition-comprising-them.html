preferable with a proviso that R1 a and R2a come together to form a saturated ring and Cy2<br>
is an unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring when Cy1 is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted phenyl. Moreover, Cy2 is a substituted pyridin-2-yl having one or more<br>
cyano as a substituent when Cy1 is an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl and Cy2 is a<br>
substituted pyridin-2-yl. Cy2 does not include unsubstituted pyridin-2-yl, when Cy1 is<br>
an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl. The substituted pyridin-2-yl having one or more<br>
cyano as a substituent means that the substituted pyridin-2-yl has only cyano as a<br>
substituent or cyano and another substituent; as substituents.<br>

Moreover, drugs which are also effective for pests or Acarnia that are of<br>
resistant lineage are desired because in recent years, resistance to organophosphorus<br>
pesticides, carbamate pesticides, or acaricides developed among many pests such as<br>
Plutella xylostella, Delphacidae, Deltocephalidae, and Aphididae has caused problems<br>
because of insufficient effects of these drugs. The compounds of the present invention<br>
are drugs having excellent insecticidal and acaricidal effects not only on those of<br>
sensitive lineages but also on pests of lineages resistant to organophosphorus pesticides,<br>
carbamate pesticides, and pyrethroid pesticides, and on Acarnia of lineages resistant to<br>
acaricides.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of the present invention are drugs that show less<br>
herbicide injuries, have lower toxicity to fish and warm-blooded animals, and higher<br>
safety.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used as an antifoulant to<br>
prevent aquatic organisms attaching to objects which contact water such as ship bottoms<br>
(or hulls, alternatively) and fishing nets.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention exhibit germicidal activities,<br>
herbicidal activities, or plant-growth regulating activities. Moreover, some<br>
intermediates of the compounds of the present invention, which are represented by the<br>
formula (1) or (3), exhibit insecticidal/acaricidal activities.<br>
The agents for pest control of the present invention have the compounds of the<br>
present invention, which are represented by the formula (1) or (3), as active ingredients<br><br>
and the agents can be used either singularly or by mixing two or more thereof. The<br>
compounds of the present invention can be used as they are without adding any other<br>
components. However, when used practically, they are normally further mixed with<br>
solid, liquid, or gaseous carriers, or are impregnated in substrates such as porous ceramic<br>
plates and nonwoven fabrics, and by adding surfactants and/or other adjuvants where<br>
necessary, used as formulations in the form which general agrochemicals may adopt, that<br>
is, wettable powder, granule, dusting powder, emulsion, water-soluble powder,<br>
suspending agent, granulated wettable powder, floable, aerosol, transpiration agent by<br>
heating, fumigant, poison bait, microcapsule, or the like.<br>
As additives and carriers, vegetable powders such as soy flour and wheat flour;<br>
fine mineral powder such as diatomaceous earth, apatite, gypsum, talc, bentonite,<br>
pyrophyllite, and clay; and organic and inorganic compounds such as sodium benzoate,<br>
urea, and sodium sulfate are used when solid formulation is required. When liquid form<br>
of formulation is required, petroleum fractions such as kerosene, xylene, and solvent<br>
naphtha, and cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
alcohol, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, mineral oil, vegetable oil, water, or the like are<br>
used as a solvent. As gaseous carriers used in propellant, butane (gas), LPG, dimethyl<br>
ether, and carbon dioxide gas can be used.<br>
As a substrate of poison bait, bait components such as grain powder, vegetable<br>
oil, sugar, and crystalline cellulose; antioxidants such as dibutylhydroxytoluene and<br>
nordihydroguaiaretic acid; preservatives such as dehydroacetic acid; agents for<br>
preventing accidental ingestion by children or pets such as capsicum powder; and<br>
pest-insect attracting scents such as cheese scents and onion scents can be used.<br>
Additionally, in order to achieve homogenous and stable forms in these<br>
formulations, it is also possible to add surfactants if necessary. Although surfactants are<br><br>
not particularly limited, examples thereof include, for instance, nonionic surfactants such<br>
as alkyl ether where polyoxyethylene is added, higher fatty acid ester where<br>
polyoxyethylene is added, sorbitan higher fatty acid ester where polyoxyethylene is<br>
added, and tristyryl phenyl ether where polyoxyethylene is added; sulfate ester salt of<br>
alkyl phenyl ether where polyoxyethylene is added, alkyl naphthalene sulfonate salt,<br>
polycarboxylate salt, lignin sulfonate salt, formaldehyde condensate of alkyl naphthalene<br>
sulfonate, and isobutylene-maleic anhydride copolymer.<br>
When the compounds of the present invention are used as agents for pest control<br>
in agriculture, the amount of active ingredient in the formulation is 0.01 to 90 weight%<br>
and particularly preferably 0.05 to 85 weight% and wettable powder, emulsion,<br>
suspending agents, floable agents, water-soluble powder, granulated wettable powder<br>
which are diluted to predetermined concentrations with water, and dusting powder and<br>
granules as they are, can be applied onto plants or soil.<br>
In addition, when the compounds of the present invention are used as agents for<br>
pest control in quarantine purposes, emulsion, wettable powder, floable agents, and the<br>
like are applied by diluting to predetermined concentrations with water and oil solution,<br>
and aerosol, poison bait, anti-acarid sheet, and the like can be applied as they are.<br>
When the compounds of the present invention are used as agents for pest control<br>
in controlling ectoparasites of livestock such as cattle and pigs or of pets such as dogs<br>
and cats, formulations using the compounds of the present invention are used in known<br>
methods in the field of veterinary medicine. As such methods, examples thereof<br>
include a method for administering in forms such as tablets, capsules, immersion liquid,<br>
feedstuff mix, suppository, and injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intraperitoneal, or the like) when systemic control is required and a method for<br>
administering by spraying, pouring-on, or spotting-on oily- or aqueous liquid<br><br>
formulations or a method for mounting objects, which are resin formulations shaped into<br>
collars, ear tags, or the like, when non-systemic control is required. In this case, the<br>
proportion can be normally used where 0.01 to 1000 mg of the compounds of the present<br>
invention are applied per 1 kg of host animal.<br>
It should be noted that although the compounds of the present invention are,<br>
needless to say, sufficiently effective even when used solely, they can also be used by<br>
mixing or combining with one or more of other agents for pest control, germicides,<br>
insecticides/acaricides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, synergists, fertilizers, soil<br>
conditioners, animal feed, or the like.<br>
