				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recording AV data from a data storage medium. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus for recording AV data from a data storage medium having information used to control a buffering state of a mark-up document.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Interactive DVDs having markup documents to reproduce content thereof in an interactive mode are being commercialized in the market. Generally, content recorded on an interactive DVD is reproduced in two different modes. One of the two modes is a video mode, in which the content is displayed in the same manner as that of data recorded on a general DVD. The other mode is an interactive mode, in which the content is displayed through a display window defined by markup documents of the interactive DVD.<br>
Where a user selects an interactive mode, a web browser installed in a DVD player displays the markup documents recorded on the interactive DVD. Content selected by the user is displayed through the display window defined by the mark-up documents. For example, where the content is a movie title, a movie is displayed in the display window on a screen, and various pieces of additional information, for example, the scenario, synopsis, and actors' and actresses' photos, may be displayed on the rest of the screen. Such additional information includes image files or text files.<br><br><br>
FIG. 1 shows an interactive DVD on which audio video (AV) data is recorded.   The AV data and a plurality of markup documents are recorded on tracks of the interactive DVD, in a form of an MPEG bitstream.   Here, the markup documents may include markup resources including various image files or graphic files to be inserted into the markup documents.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates discontinuous reproduction of data from the interactive DVD of FIG. 1.   That is, FIG. 2 shows the occupancy of a buffer memory, which is used to buffer AV data, and the occupancy of a cache memory, which is used to cache web resources.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a method of loading AV data into a memory and displaying the AV data will be described.   A pickup device searches for a markup document STARTUP.HTM and loads the searched markup document STARTUP.HTM into a cache memory. Thereafter, the STARTUP.HTM is activated.   At the same time, AV data <d selected by a user is loaded into buffer memory and then displayed. thereafter av data the where buffering of complete pickup device jumps to place on interactive dvd recorded starts at this time may request markup document a.htm. in case stops searches for a.htm loads cache memory. while searching loading it kept from being therefore amount that can be buffered drastically decreased as still occupies space activated> is complete, AV data ® is buffered.   Thereafter, the pickup device jumps to a place<br><br>
where AV data © is recorded.   In the above method, all the data that has been buffered so far may disappear.    In other words, where a reproduction of DVD-video images from a conventional interactive DVD in synchronization with markup documents is requested, for example, where a display of a specific actor's or actress's personal history whenever he or she appears on a screen is requested, the pickup device stops buffering AV data and begins searching for and caching the associated markup documents, and thus images may be discontinuously reproduced.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a data storage medium comprising control information to control a buffering state of markup documents that are used to reproduce AV data in an interactive mode, and an apparatus and a method to reproduce the Av data from the data storage medium.<br>

Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.   The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
Apparatuses for and methods of preloading data and deleting the preloaded data are disclosed by the present applicant in Korean Patent Application No. 2002-57393, filed on September 19, 2002.   While the disclosure thereof is incorporated herein by reference, the following description of the disclosure is presented to further illustrate the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an apparatus for reproducing data from a data storage medium that carries out a preloading or deleting operation with respect to markup documents.   The apparatus supports an interactive mode, in which an AV data stream is reproduced from the data storage medium, for example, a DVD 300, by decoding AV data recorded on the DVD 300 and then displaying the decoded data in a display window defined by markup documents.   The apparatus includes a reader 1, a first memory 2, a second memory 3, an AV decoder 4, and a presentation engine 5.   During an interactive mode, an AV screen is displayed while being embedded in a markup screen.   The markup documents are displayed in the markup screen, and the AV screen is obtained by reproducing the AV data.<br>
The presentation engine 5 supports extensions to link tags, JavaScript, or Java Applet, so as to interpret and execute preload information written using link tags, the JavaScript application program<br><br>
interface (API), or the Java Applet API and deletion information written using the JavaScript API or the Java Applet API.<br>
The reader 1 reads markup documents or AV data from the DVD 300.   The first memory 2 is, for example, a buffer memory, and buffers the AV data read by the reader 1.   The second memory 3 is, for example, a cache memory, and caches a received preload file.   The AV decoder 4 decodes the AV data stored in the first memory 2 and outputs an AV data stream.   The presentation engine 5 interprets the preload information, which is included in the markup documents read by the reader 1 and issues a request to the reader 1 or an Internet server (not shown) for files to be preloaded into the second memory 3 based on the interpreted preload information.   To synchronize the display of the files and the AV data, the preloaded files are read from the second memory 3 and displayed together with the AV data stream output from the AV decoder 4.   The files are deleted from the second memory 3 by interpreting deletion information.<br>
The DVD 300 comprises audio data or AV data, and markup documents having preload information and/or deletion information.   In addition, a preload-list file and/or a deletion-list file may be recorded on the DVD 300.<br>
The preload-list file includes a list of files to be preloaded and the size of each file to be preloaded.   The files to be preloaded represent markup documents, which are reproduced in synchronization with corresponding AV data.   The files to be preloaded may be recorded on the DVD 300.   The files to be preloaded, however, may also be stored in an Internet server that is accessible through the Internet.<br>
Preload information comprises a command to read the files to be preloaded from, for example, the DVD 300 and then store the files in the cache memory 3.   The preload information may be specified using a link tag, which includes the path and attributes of the preload-list file and is inserted into a head tag.   On the other hand, the preload information<br><br>
may be specified using a JavaScript application program interface (API) or a Java Applet API, having the path and/or attribute of the preload-list file as function parameters and enabling the reproduction of the preload-list file.   The preload information may also be specified using a JavaScript API or a Java Applet API, having the path and/or attribute of each file to be preloaded as function parameters and enabling the reproduction of files, in which case the preload-list file is unnecessary.<br>
The deletion-list file includes a list of files to be deleted, with the location information of each file to be deleted, i.e., the file name and path of each file to be deleted.   The deletion information represents a command to delete files from the second memory 3.   The deletion information may be specified using a JavaScript API or a Java Applet API having the location information of the deletion-list file as a function parameter and enabling the deletion of files that are listed on the deletion-list We.   On the other hand, the deletion information may be specified using a JavaScript API or a Java Applet API having the location information of each file to be deleted as a function parameter and enabling the deletion of files, hi which case the deletion-list file is unnecessary.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a directory structure of the DVD 300.   Referring to FIG. 4, a root directory includes a DVD video directory VIDEOJTS having AV data and a DVD interactive directory DVD_ENAV having data to support an interactive function.<br>
Header information VIDEOJTS.IFO concerning all video titles recorded on the DVD 300, navigation information VTS_01_O.IFO fora first video title, and AV data VTS_01 J).VOB, VTS_01_1.VOB,... constituting a first video title are recorded in the DVD video directory VIDEO_TS.   The detailed description of the structure of the DVD video directory VIDEO_TS is disclosed in the DVD-Video standard (DVD-Video for Read Only Memory Disc 1.0).<br><br>
Navigation information DVD_ENAV.IFO regarding the entire interactive information and a start-up document STARTUP.HTM are recorded in the DVD interactive directory DVD_ENAV.    In addition, a preload-list file STARTUP.PLD, a file to be preloaded A.HTM, and a graphic file A.PNG inserted into A.HTM are also provided in the DVD interactive directory DVD_ENAV.   Other files to be preloaded or graphic files inserted thereto may also be recorded in the DVD interactive directory DVD_ENAV.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a volume space of the DVD 300.   Referring to FIG. 5, the volume space comprises a control information region which includes control information for the volume space of the DVD 300 and files recorded on the DVD 300, a DVD-Video data region where video title data is recorded, and a DVD-Interactive data region which is provided to reproduce AV data during an interactive mode.<br>
The files stored in the DVD video directory VIDEOJTS of FIG. 4, i.e., VIDEO_TS.IFO, VTS_01_O.IFO, VTS_01_O.VOB, VTS_01_1.VOB, ..., are recorded in the DVD-Video data region.   The files stored in the DVD interactive directory DVD_ENAVr i.e., STARTUP.HTM, STARTUP.PLD, A.HTM, and A.PNG, are recorded in the DVD-Interactive data region.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a method of reproducing data from a data storage medium.   In operation 601, the reader 1 reads an HTML document, which is a markup document recorded on the DVD 300, from the DVD 300 where an interactive mode is selected.   In operation 602, the presentation engine 5 interprets preload information included in the HTML document and requests that the reader 1 or an Internet server preload files.   In response to the request, files to be preloaded are stored in the second memory 3 in operation 603.<br>
The reader 1 reads AV data, corresponding to the HTML document read in the operation 601, from the DVD 300 and stores the read AV data in the first memory 2, which is a buffer memory, in<br><br>
operation 604.   The AV decoder 4 decodes AV data stored in the first memory 2 into an AV data stream in operation 605.    In operation 606, the presentation engine 5 reads the preloaded files from the second memory 3 and displays the decoded AV data stream in a display window, which is defined by the HTML document read by the reader 1 in the operation 601.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a method of interpreting preload information, the method corresponding to the operation 602 of FIG. 6.    In operation 701, the presentation engine 5 recognizes the path of a preload-list file included in an HTML document and reads the preload-list file by following the recognized path in operation 702.   In operation 703, the presentation engine 5 recognizes the files to be preloaded, which are listed in the preload-list file.   Here, recognition of the files to be preloaded indicates recognition of the paths and attributes of the files to be preloaded.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a method of preloading files, the method corresponding to the operation 603 of FIG. 6.   In operation 801, the presentation engine 5 identifies the path recorded in a link tag of the preload-list file and draws the preload-list file.   In operation 802, the presentation engine 5 interprets the preload-list file, which includes a preload tag that has the paths and attributes of the files to be preloaded as parameters, and performs a preloading of the files.<br>
FIG. 9A illustrates another method of preloading files, the method corresponding to the operation 603 of FIG. 6.   In operation 901 a, the presentation engine 5 interprets the API inserted into a body tag using parameters specifying the paths of the files to be preloaded and reads the files to be preloaded using the API.   In operation 901 b, the presentation engine 5 performs a preloading by interpreting the preload-list file that includes the paths and attributes of the files to be preloaded.   Since the presentation engine 5 can determine the attributes of the files to be preloaded, it can process the files to be<br><br>
preloaded based on their attributes and store the processed files in a memory.<br>
FIG. 9B illustrates still another method of preloading files, the method corresponding to the operation 603 of FIG. 6.    In operation 901 b, the presentation engine 5 preloads files to be preloaded into a memory using the API inserted into a body tag and having the paths and attributes of the files to be preloaded as parameters.   Since an attribute of a file to be preloaded is be identified, the presentation engine 5 may process the file to be preloaded in consideration of its attribute and then store the file to be preloaded in a memory.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a method of deleting one or more of the preloaded files that are stored in a memory.   In operation 1001, the presentation engine 5 interprets deletion information included in an HTML document, identifies files to be deleted based on a deletion-list file, and deletes the identified files from the second memory 3 in operation 1002.   While the preload-list file and the deletion-list file are integrated into a single file, i.e., STARTUP.PLD, it is understood that a list of files to be preloaded and a list of files to be deleted can be realized as two separate files rather than being integrated into a single file.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a method of deleting one or more files from a cache memory, the method corresponding to the operation 1002 of FIG. 10.   A list of files to be deleted may be recorded in the deletion-list file. In operation 1101, the files are deleted from the second memory 3 using an API, having the path of the deletion-list file as a parameter.   Here, the deletion of the files may be a process of physically removing the files from the second memory 3, a process of including in the files a flag indicating that the files can be deleted from the second memory 3, or the files can be overwritten by other data without physically removing the files from the second memory 3.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates the effects of a preloading process on an interactive DVD where AV data and HTML documents are recorded In<br><br>
the same manner as in FIG. 1.   That is, FIG. 12 shows occupancy of the first memory 2 where MPEG-coded AV data is buffered and occupancy of the second memory 3 where a web resource is cached.   Referring to FIGS. 1 and 12, the reader 1 searches for and reads STARTUP.HTM, and the presentation engine 5 interprets the preload information included in the STARTUP.HTM so that ® A.HTM is preloaded into the second memory 3.   Where the STARTUP.HTM, which is loaded into the second memory 3, is activated, ® AV data is loaded into the first memory 2 and then displayed.   Thereafter, ® AV data is loaded into the first memory 2 and then displayed.   Where buffering of the ® AV data is completed, the reader 1 jumps to a place where ® AV data is recorded and starts buffering the ® AV data.   At this time, where a user requests ® A.HTM, the presentation engine 5 reads ® A.HTM from the second memory 3 and displays the ® A.HTM.    In this case, there is no need for the reader 1 to stop the buffering of the ® AV data, search the DVD 300 for the ® A.HTM, and then load the document ® A.HTM into the second memory 3.   Therefore, the reader 1 can continue to buffer the (D AV data. Where the reader 1 completes the buffering of (D AV data and jumps to a place where © AV data is recorded, the amount of data buffered in the first memory 2 may be reduced.   However, the amount of data that has been buffered in the first memory 2 is sufficient so that a shortage in buffered data does not occur.   In other words, even where there is a need to display DVD-video images, reproduced from an interactive DVD during the interactive mode, in synchronization with HTML documents, the reader 1 does not have to stop the buffering of AV data and then search for and cache the HTML documents.   This is because the HTML documents have already been preloaded in the second memory 3.   For example, synchronization display may be used where there is a need to display a specific actor's or actress's personal history whenever he or she appears on a screen.<br><br>
Again, the above-described apparatus, storage medium and processes of preloading data and deleting the preloaded data are taught by the present applicant in Korean Patent Application No. 02-57393 filed on September 19, 2002.   Hereinafter, a data storage medium and a method and apparatus for reproducing data from the data storage medium according to the present invention will be described.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a block diagram of an apparatus for reproducing data from a data storage medium according to an embodiment of the present invention.   The apparatus of FIG. 13, similar to that of FIG. 3, reproduces data from a data storage medium.   In addition, the apparatus of FIG. 13 supports an interactive mode, carries out a preloading, and includes an AV buffer 20, an AV reproduction engine 40, an enhanced audio and video (ENAV) buffer 30, and an ENAV engine 50.<br>
The AV buffer 20, which corresponds to a first memory 2 of FIG. 3, buffers AV data read from a storage medium, for example, a disk 100, or a network, for example, the Internet.   The AV reproduction engine 40 decodes the buffered AV data, thereby outputttng an AV stream.   The ENAV buffer 30, for example, is a cache memory corresponding to a second memory 3 of FIG. 3.   The ENAV buffer 30 buffers markup documents read from the disk 100 or the network.   The ENAV engine 50, which corresponds to the presentation engine 5 of FIG. 3, carries out a preloading and controls a buffering state of the markup documents stored in the ENAV buffer 30.   In addition, the ENAV engine 50 interprets or decodes the markup documents stored in the ENAV buffer 30.   The ENAV engine 50 allows the AV stream output from the AV reproduction engine 40 to be reproduced in an interactive mode.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a detailed block diagram of the ENAV engine 50 of FIG. 13 according to an embodiment of the present invention.   The ENAV engine 50 comprises a buffer manager 51 which controls the<br><br>
ENAV buffer 30 and a content decoder 52 which interprets the markup documents.<br>
The content decoder 52 may comprise an interpretation engine which parses and interprets the markup documents, and a browser which draws the markup documents from the interpretation engine and/or the network.   Here, the markup documents correspond to various kinds of markup resources, ranging from markup text data written in HTML, CSS, or JAVASCRIPT to binary data, such as image data, audio data, or a Java program, which is referred to by markup documents. The markup documents are drawn from the disk 100 or the network by the buffer manager 51 in the ENAV engine 50.<br>
With respect to preloading or deleting of markup documents, the buffer manager 51 manages a buffering state of the markup documents in a predetermined manner according to the present invention. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the buffer manager 51 responds to a signal output from the content decoder 52. For example, the buffer manager 51 may operate differently in response to different signals output from the content decoder 52.   The signals may include, for example, a fetch signal, a reproduce signal, a release signal, a discard signal, and a report signal.<br>
FIG. 15 shows the buffer manager 51 which manages a buffering state of markup documents processed by the ENAV buffer 30, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   For example, five different signals, i.e., a fetch signal, a reproduce signal, a release signal, a discard signal, and a report signal, may be input into the buffer manager 51 from the content decoder 52.<br>
A fetch signal is used to preload markup documents into the ENAV buffer 30.   Where the markup documents are already preloaded into the ENAV buffer 30, an I/O manager may prevent the corresponding markup documents from being read from a disk or a network.   The I/O manager represents a reader (not shown), which reads data from thp<br><br>
disk, or a network data receiver/transmitter (not shown), which receives data from the network.   The reader reads files from the disk, and the network data receiver/transmitter receives predetermined data from and/or transmits predetermined data to the network using, for example, a HTTP protocol.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, the I/O manager may be set to operate in the following manners.   Where an HTTP request is issued, the I/O manager uses an unblocked I/O.   Where a request for files on a disk is issued, the I/O manager uses a blocked I/O.   To reproduce markup documents from a network, the I/O manager adopts an unblocked method so as to receive a plurality of markup documents at a given time.   However, where a plurality of markup documents is read from a disk at a given time, a pickup device (not shown) in the reader is required to move between locations where the markup documents are recorded. Accordingry, the speed of reading the corresponding markup documents may be lowered by many times.   Therefore, in the case where a plurality of markup documents is to be read from a disk, a sequential blocked I/O process is adopted, in which the plurality of markup documents are sequentially read from the disk.<br>
A reproduce signal is used to issue a request to transfer data from the ENAV buffer 30 to the content decoder 52.   Where predetermined data is read from a disk or downloaded from a network, the content decoder 52 may be blocked from operating until reading or downloading of the predetermined data is completed.<br>
A release signal indicates that the predetermined data transferred from the ENAV buffer 30 to the content decoder 52, in response to the above-described reproduce signal, is no longer needed.   For example, where a predetermined markup document is referred to five times in response to a reproduce signal, a release signal is generated five times. A counter value increases whenever a reproduce signal is generated and decreases whenever a release signal is generated.   Where a counter<br><br>
value corresponding to a predetermine markup document reaches 0, i.e., where all reproduced markup documents are released, the released markup documents are deleted from the ENAV buffer 30 in response to a discard signal, which is described below.<br>
A discard signal indicates that predetermined markup documents stored in the ENAV buffer 30 can be deleted from the ENAV buffer 30, for example, because they will not be used any more.   Therefore, in response to the discard signal, the predetermined markup documents are discarded from the ENAV buffer 30.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, where markup documents are associated with another application and a reproduce signal has been generated, but a release signal has not been generated, the markup documents cannot be deleted from the ENAV buffer 30, even where a discard signal has been generated by a predetermined application.<br>
A report signal is used to verify, for example, whether markup documents read in response to a fetch signal are successfully loaded into the ENAV buffer 30, whether at least some of the corresponding markup documents cannot be read due to errors, and/or whether the corresponding markup documents are being read.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the above and/or other signals of the present invention are provided using an API corresponding to, for example, a script written in a markup document. The fallowings, while not limited thereto, are examples of APIs used to generate a variety of signals utilized in the present invention.<br> Description:<br>
This API is used to preload files, or read files and store the files in the ENAV buffer 30.   Parameters of the API include location information of a<br><br>
preload-list file or location information of files to be preloaded, and attributes of the files to be preloaded. This API generates a fetch signal and may apply to all files that may be read from a disk (disc://) or a network (http://).    It is understood that an API may be used to preload a file.<br>

Anavigator.discard("disc://dvd-enav/a.pld", "xml/preload") request refers to a request to delete files listed in the deletion-list file of "disc://dvd_enav/a.pld," from the cache memory. The files are list files written in XML.<br> Description:<br><br>
This API is used to check, for example, whether files have been successfully stored/loaded in the ENAV buffer 30.   Parameters of the API include location information of a list file or location information of the files to be searched for/checked, and attributes of the files to be checked.   The API generates a report signal and may be applied to all files that are read from a disk (disc://) or a network (http://).   It is understood that an API may be used to check the status of a file.<br>
Parameters:<br>
URL = : a path of the list file or paths of the files to<br>
be checked<br>
resType =: attributes of the files to be checked<br>
Return Values:<br>
Where a file listed in the list file or a file to be checked is successfully stored/loaded in the ENAV buffer 30, a value of 0 is returned.   Where the checked file is not successfully loaded, that is, preloading of the file failed, a value of 1 is returned. Where the file is still being read/loaded, or where during preloading of files no failure have occurred and at least one of the files is still being read/loaded, a value of 2 is returned.<br>
Examples:<br>

This API indicates how much of the file currently being preloaded is yet to be preloaded<br>
Return value: a value represented in a unit of byte<br><br>
Description: This API indicates, for example, a total load of files to be preloaded.<br>
Return value: a value represented in a unit of byte<br><br><br>
Description:<br>
This API indicates, for example, how much of the total load of files to be preloaded is yet to be dealt with.<br>
Return value: a value represented in a unit of byte<br><br>
Description:<br>
This API indicates, for example, whether an apparatus for reproducing data from a data storage medium has completed preloading.<br>
Return values:<br>
Where the apparatus has successfully completed the preloading, this API returns a value of TRUE. Otherwise, a value of FALSE is returned.   For example, where the preloading is not completed, that is, where the preloading has failed or is in process, a value of FALSE is returned.<br>
As described above, according to an aspect of the present invention, a reproduce signal and a release signal are generated whenever corresponding markup documents are used.   For example, the content decoder 52 presents an image of "disc://dvd_enav/a.png" using a display device (not shown) by interpreting <img srcs: l> and generating a reproduce signal so as to have the buffer manager 51 reproduce the corresponding image from the ENAV buffer 30.   Likewise, the content decoder 52 generates a release signal where the presentation of the corresponding image is complete.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a method of controlling a buffer state carried out by the content decoder 52 and the buffer manager 51, according to<br><br>
an embodiment of the present invention.    In operation 1601, the content decoder 52 generates a fetch signal in response to a preload command.<br>
In operation 1602, the buffer manager 51 starts to read designated markup documents in response to the fetch signal.    In operation 1603, the content decoder 52 determines, for example, whether all of the markup documents have been read and/or generates a report signal to determine, for example, a buffering state of the markup documents.   In operation 1604, where an error occurs, the error is processed.    In operation 1605, the buffer manager returns a signal indicating the buffering state of the markup documents in response to the report signal.<br>
In operation 1606, the content decoder 52 generates a retrieves signal to use the markup documents.    In operation 1607, the buffer manager<br>
51	transfers the designated markup documents to the content decoder<br>
52	in response to the retrieve signal.   In operation 1608, the content<br>
decoder 52 presented the designated markup documents.   In operation<br>
1609, where the designated markup documents are no longer to be used,<br>
the content decoder 52 generates a release signal.   In operation 1610,<br>
the buffer manager 51 decreases a current value a counter by 1 to<br>
indicate, for example, use of a corresponding one/ones of the designated<br>
markup documents.   In operation 1611, the content decoder 52<br>
generates a discard signal to delete the designated markup documents.<br>
In operation 1612, the buffer manager 51 deletes the designated markup<br>
documents from the ENAV buffer 30 in response to the discard signal.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates a data storage medium, for example, a disk, on which AV data and markup documents are recorded, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   The data storage medium further comprises control information which is used to identify buffering state information of a markup document to be preloaded.   For example, a startup document STARTUP.HTM includes a preload list file STARTUP.PLD to seamlessly reproduce files ranging from A.HTM to D.HTM.<br><br>
The control information may include an API that returns a value of 0 in response to preloading of the markup document being successful, a value of 1 in response to the preloading of the markup document being failed, and a value of 2 in response to the preloading of the markup document still being conducted.   The control information may further include an API that generates a fetch signal to issue a command to preload the markup document.   This API may return a response indicating whether the command to preload the markup document has been successfully transmitted.   The control information may further include an API that is used to determine whether preloading of the markup document is completed.   This API may return a value of TRUE in response to the preloading of the markup document being completed and a value of FALSE in response to the preloading of the markup document being not completed.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates a directory structure of the disk of FIG. 17 according to an embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 18, reference documents of the startup document STARTUP.PLD are inducted in a directory DVD_ENAV.<br>
FIG. 19 illustrates a volume structure and file structure of the disk of FIG. 17 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 19, the reference documents of the STARTUP.PLD are recorded in a DVD interactive data area.<br>
FIG. 20 illustrates a predetermined order in which the markup documents and the AV data recorded on the disk of FIG. 17 are reproduced.   For example, where each scene begins, whether reference files of a preload list file corresponding to the scene have been read is checked using an IsCashed API.   Where reading of the reference files has been successfully completed, HTM documents are read and reproduced.   Thereafter, markup documents that have already been reproduced are discarded using a Discard API.<br><br>
For example, to seamlessly reproduce data from STARTUP.HTM, A.HTM, and D.HTM, STARTUP.PLD is specified as follows.<br><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><br>

It is understood that a system which uses the present invention also includes permanent or removable storage, such as magnetic and optical discs, RAM, ROM, a carrier wave medium, etc., on which the process and data structures of the present invention can be stored and distributed.   The operations can also be distributed via, for example, downloading over a network such as the Internet.<br/>
Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.<br/>
Industrial Applicability<br/>
For example, according to the present invention, images may be presented using only preloaded files as content is processed using a method which enables determination of the preloaded content state, even where physical defects of a disk or connection disruptions cause unsuccessful or incomplete preloading of files into a buffer.   Accordingly, the reliability of reproducing the content is improved.    That is, according to an aspect of the present invention, AV data may be presented in an appropriate manner in an interactive mode even though the markup documents have not been entirely preloaded or an error occurs during preloading of the markup documents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We Claim:<br/>
1.	An apparatus for reproducing AV data from a data storage medium having AV<br/>
data, a markup document which is provided to reproduce the AV data in an<br/>
interactive mode; and control information which is provided to identify<br/>
buffering state information of the markup document to be preloaded, said<br/>
apparatus comprising:<br/>
a buffer which buffers the markup document;<br/>
a buffer manager which manages the buffer to preload the markup document<br/>
and outputs buffering state information of the buffer in response to a report<br/>
signal, wherein the buffering state information of the buffer contains buffering<br/>
information of the markup document; and<br/>
characterized in that,<br/>
a content decoder interprets the markup document and outputs the report<br/>
signal, wherein the buffer manager informs the content decoder of the<br/>
buffering state information of the buffer in response to the report signal.<br/>
2.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using an application program interface (API).<br/>
3.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the API serves to notify the content decoder of whether preloading of the markup document succeeded or failed, or whether the markup document is still being loaded.<br/>
4.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the API returns a value of 0 where the preloading of the markup document succeeded, returns a value of 1 where the preloading of the markup document failed, and returns a value of 2 where the markup document is still being loaded.<br/>
5.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using an API, which contains at least one of a file path and an attribute of the markup document as a parameter.<br/>
6.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using an API.<br/>
 <br/>
7.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the buffer manager informs the content decoder of a buffering state of the markup document utilizing an API.<br/>
8.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the buffer manager preloads the markup document into the buffer in response to a fetch signal.<br/>
9.	The apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the content decoder interprets the markup document and outputs the fetch signal, wherein the buffer manager informs the content decoder of whether a command to preload the markup document, included in the fetch signal, has been successfully received.<br/>
10.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 9, wherein the content decoder generates the fetch signal using an API.<br/>
11.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 10, wherein the buffer manager informs the content decoder of whether the command has been successfully received using the API.<br/>
12.	The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the content decoder which interprets the markup document, the said content decoder checks whether preloading of the markup document is completed using an API.<br/>
<br/>
13.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 12, wherein the API returns a value of true to the content decoder where the preloading of the markup document is completed and returns a value of false to the content decoder where the preloading of the markup document is not completed.<br/>
14.	The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the content decoder which interprets the markup document, the said buffer manager transfers the markup document from the buffer to the content decoder in response to a reproduce signal.<br/>
15.	The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the content decoder which interprets the markup document, the said content decoder outputs a<br/>
 <br/>
release signal to the buffer manager indicating that the markup document therein brought from the buffer, in response to a reproduce signal, is not in use.<br/>
16.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 15, wherein the content decoder outputs the release signal to the buffer manager in response to the markup document no longer being displayed in a screen of a display device.<br/>
17.	The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the content decoder interprets the markup document, wherein the buffer manager deletes the markup document from the buffer in response to a discard signal output from the content decoder.<br/>
18.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 17, wherein the content decoder generates the discard signal using a discard API.<br/>
19.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using a API to determine a file name of the markup document currently being preloaded.<br/>
20.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using a API to determine how much of the markup document currently being preloaded has been preloaded.<br/>
21.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using a API to determine out how much of the markup document currently being preloaded is yet to be preloaded.<br/>
22.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using a API to determine a total load of the markup document to be preloaded.<br/>
23.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content decoder generates the report signal using a API to determine how much of a total load of the markup document is yet to be preloaded.<br/>
24.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the buffer manager outputs the<br/>
 <br/>
information of the buffer using an application program interface.<br/>
25.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the information of the buffer contains information indicating whether a command to preload the markup document has been successfully received.<br/>
26.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the information of the buffer contains information indicating whether preloading of the markup document is completed.<br/>
