				<td>SYNTHESIS OF ITQ-17 IN THE ABSENCE OF FLUORIDE IONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention refers to a novel microporous<br>
crystalline material which in a roasted state has a<br>
composition equivalent to ITQ-17, and that is synthesized<br>
in the absence of fluoride ions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Zeolites are microporous crystalline<br>
aluminosilicates that have found important uses as<br>
catalysts, adsorbents and ionic exchangers. Many of these<br>
zeolitic materials have well defined structures that form<br>
channels and cavities inside themselves which because of<br>
having a uniform size and shape permit adsorption of<br>
certain molecules, whereas they prevent other molecules -<br>
which are too large to diffuse through the pores - from<br>
passing inside the crystal. This property gives these<br>
materials molecular sieve properties. These molecular<br>
sieves can include in the lattice Si and other elements<br>
of group IIIA of the periodic system, all of them<br>
tetrahedrally coordinated, the tetrahedrons being<br>
attached by their vertexes by means of oxygen atoms of<br>
the lattice. The negative charge produced by the<br>
elements of group IIIA tetrahedrally coordinated in<br>
lattice positions is compensated by the presence in the<br>
crystal of cations such as for example alkali or alkaline<br>
earth metals. A type of cation may be totally or<br>
partially exchanged by another type of cation by ionic<br>
exchange techniques. By means of cationic exchange it is<br>
possible to vary the properties of a given silicate by<br>
selecting the desired cation.<br>
Many zeolites have been synthesized in the presence<br>
of an organic molecule that acts as a structure directing<br>
agent. Very frequently these organic molecules that act<br>
as structure directing agents (SDA) contain nitrogen in<br>
their composition that can give rise to stable organic<br>
cations in the reaction medium.<br>
Mobilization of silica may be carried out in the<br>
presence of OH- groups and a basic medium that may be<br>
introduced by the SDA itself, such as for example,<br>
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide in the case of zeolite ZSM-<br>
5. It is also known that fluoride ions can also mobilize<br>
silica for the synthesis of zeolites, and the use of HF<br>
in H2O at a low pH as a mobilizing agent of silica for<br>
the synthesis of ZSM-5 has been described, for example,<br>
in European patent EP-337479.<br>
In the same way zeolite ITQ-17 has been synthesized<br>
in a conventional manner in the synthesis of zeolites, as<br>
described in patent application PCT/ES01/00385, by means<br>
of a process that comprises the use of fluorides.<br>
However, the use of fluoride ions in synthesis is<br>
less desired from an industrial point of view than the<br>
use of OH", given that the presence of fluoride ions<br>
requires the use of special materials in the synthesis<br>
equipment, as well as a specific treatment of the waste<br>
water and gases.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a crystalline<br>
material characterized in that it does not contain<br>
fluorides, with a composition in a roasted state<br>
corresponding to that of the material called ITQ-17 and<br>
in that it has a composition on an anhydrous base and in<br>

wherein (I/Io) represents relative intensities, Io being<br>
the intensity of the most intense peak to which a value<br>
of 100 has been assigned. The relative intensities have<br>
been expressed in the following terms: w = weak intensity<br>
(between 0 and 20%); m = medium intensity (between 20 and<br>
40%); s = strong intensity (between 40 and 60%) and vs =<br>
very strong intensity (between 60 and 100%).<br>
From the values given for the coefficients of the<br>
formula it is inferred that this material may be obtained<br>
in the absence of added trivalent elements.<br>
In a particular embodiment "X" is at least one<br>
element selected among Al, B, Fe, In, Ga and Cr.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>

silicon.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention R<br>
is preferably the cation 1-methyl-4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo<br>
[2.2.2] octane (DABMe+) or the cation 1, 4-bis [N-(4-aza, 1-<br>
azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane) methyl] benzene (d-DABBz)2+,<br>
both shown in Figure 1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
the crystalline material has a composition on an<br>
anhydrous base and in terms of oxide moles upon being<br>
synthesized, unroasted, represented by:<br>
xX2O3 : tTO2 : (1-z-t)SiO2 : zGeO2 : r/n RnO<br>
wherein:<br>
- T is one or more tetravalent elements other than<br>
Ge or Si,<br>
- t varies between 0 and 0.15, preferably between 0<br>
and 0.10,<br>
- z is comprised between 0.02 and 0.67, preferably<br>
between 0.04 and 0.5, and "x", "X", "R", "r" and "n" have<br>
the meaning given above, and wherein:<br>
- R is preferably the cation 1-methyl-4-aza,1-<br>
azoniumbicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABMe*) or the cation 1,4-<br>
bis [N-(4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2.2.2] octane)<br>
methyl] benzene (d-DABBz)2+,<br>
- X is preferably one or more elements of the group<br>
formed by B, Al, In, Ga, Fe and Cr and<br>
- T is preferably one or more tetravalent elements<br>
selected between V, Sn and Ti.<br>
Other bands or peaks that are found in the X-ray<br>
diffraction diagram of the crystalline material of the<br>
present invention are the ones shown in Table I<br>
hereinafter:<br>
TABLE I<br>
List of diffraction peaks of a characteristic sample of<br>
the crystalline material of the present invention<br>
synthesized in a basic medium and in a total absence of<br>
fluoride anions and containing DABMe+ in its pores.<br><br><br>
The diffraction patterns were obtained in a Philips<br>
PW 1830 diffractometer with a PW 1710 controller and<br>
using Ka radiation of Cu. The diffractogram has been<br>
obtained by the powder method and using a variable<br>
divergence slit.<br>
The crystalline material of the present invention,<br>
once roasted, has a composition that corresponds to that<br>
of the material called ITQ-17 and has as most important<br>
lines in its diffraction diagram:<br><br>
In particular, the pairs of 2T values represented<br>
in Table I correspond to the diffraction pattern of<br>
materials whose lattice is exclusively comprised of<br>
silicon oxide, germanium and organic matter, with a<br>
Si/Ge ratio = 2.5 and synthesized using 1-methyl-4-<br>
aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane hydroxide (DABMeOH)<br>
as the structure directing agent.<br>
Table II shows the diffraction peaks of a<br>
characteristic sample of ITQ-17 synthesized in a basic<br>
medium and in the total absence of fluoride anions and in<br>
its roasted form<br><br><br>
The sample of the roasted zeolite ITQ-17 whose<br>
diffraction values are given in Table II have a Si/Ge<br>
ratio molar = 5 and was synthesized using 1-methyl-4-<br>
aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane hydroxide (DABMeOH)<br>
as the structure directing agent.<br>
The variation in the measurements of the 2T angle<br>
due to the instrumental error is estimated at ± 0.5<br>
degrees.<br>
It should be taken into account that the listed<br>
diffraction data for these samples as simple or single<br>
lines may really be due to the overlapping of different<br>
diffraction peaks that in certain conditions, such as<br>
differences due to small crystallographic changes, may<br>
appear as distinguishable or partially distinguishable<br>
lines. Normally these crystallographic changes may<br>
include minor changes in the parameters of the unit cell<br>
and/or changes in the symmetry of the crystal, without<br>
there being a change in the structure. These minor<br>
changes, that include changes in relative intensities may<br>
also be due to differences in the type and amount of<br>
compensation cations, lattice composition, crystal size<br>
and shape thereof, preferential orientations or to the<br>
type of thermal or hydrothermal treatments endured by the<br>
material.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
wherein R is the cation 1-methyl-4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo<br>
[2.2.2] octane (DABMe+) , the crystalline material may be<br>

comprise one or more tetravalent elements, T, selected<br>
among V, Sn and Ti. Preferably the source of germanium,<br>
silicon and of the rest of the tetravalent elements is an<br>
oxide. The synthesis mixture can also comprise a source<br>
of one or more trivalent elements, x.<br>
Besides, the process of the present invention may<br>
also comprise a step of post-synthesis treatment of the<br>
material, whereby the organic component is removed from<br>
the structure by means of a technique selected among<br>
extraction, roasting and both. The material resulting<br>
from the cited post-synthesis treatment has a composition<br>
that corresponds to ITQ-17 and whose main diffraction<br>
lines are the ones given above.<br>
Therefore, according to the process of the present<br>
invention, ITQ-17 is prepared in the absence of fluoride<br>
ions, with the advantages that this involves from the<br>
point of view of industrial equipment and from the<br>
economic point of view.<br>
The organic structure directing agent DABMeOH may be<br>
easily prepared by methylation of 1,4-diazabicyclo<br>
[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) with methyl iodide, followed by<br>
exchange of the iodide anion by a hydroxide anion using<br>
an exchange resin.<br>
The organic agent d-DABBz(OH)2 may be easily<br>
prepared by reacting a,a'-dichloro-p-xylene with 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO), followed by<br>
exchange of the chloride anions by hydroxide anions using<br>
an exchange resin.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried<br>
out statically or with stirring, in autoclaves at a<br>
temperature between 100°C and 200°C, for time periods<br>
long enough to achieve crystallization, for example<br>
between 24 hours and 30 days. When the crystallization<br>
period ends, the crystals are separated from the<br>
crystalline material of the mother liquors and they are<br>
recovered. It should be taken into account that the<br>
components of the synthesis mixture can come from<br>
different sources and depending on these sources the time<br>
periods and conditions of crystallization may vary.<br>
For the purpose of facilitating synthesis,<br>
crystallization seeds may be added to the synthesis<br>
medium in amounts up to 10% by weight of the synthesis<br>
mixture.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation of l-methyl-4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo<br>
[2,2,2] octane hydroxide (DABMeOH).<br>
A solution of 11.1 g of methyl iodide in 45 g of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added drop by drop, and by means<br>
of an addition funnel, to a solution of 16.8 g of 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane in 250 g of THF. The mixture<br>
is allowed to react for 24 hours at room temperature. The<br>
solid formed is repeatedly washed with ethyl ether and<br>
left to dry. 19.2 g of 1-methyl-4-aza, 1-azoniumbicyclo<br>
[2.2.2] iodide (DABMeI) are obtained.<br>
Finally, the 19.2 g of DABMel, previously dissolved<br>
in 100 g of water are contacted with 75.7 g of a strongly<br>
basic ionic exchange resin (OH) for 24 hours at room<br>
temperature and with stirring. In this way finally 110 g<br>
of a solution of 1-methyl-4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2]<br>
octane hydroxide (DABMeOH) are obtained.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of 1,4-bis[N-(4-aza,1-<br>

g of chloroform (CH3Cl) is added drop by drop and by<br>
means of an addition funnel to a solution of 12.09 g of<br>
1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane in 250 g of CH3Cl. The<br>
mixture is allowed to react for 24 hours at room<br>
temperature. The solid formed is washed first with ethyl<br>
acetate and then with ethyl ether and left to dry. 19.42<br>
g of 1,4-bis [N-(4-aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2]<br>
methyl]benzene (d-DABBzCl2) are obtained. Finally, the<br>
19.42 g of d-DABBzCl2, previously dissolved in 100 g of<br>
water, are contacted with 90 g of a strongly basic ionic<br>
exchange resin (OH) for 24 hours at room temperature and<br>

aza,1-azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane) methyl]benzene<br>
hydroxide (d-DABBz(OH)2) are obtained.<br>

azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane hydroxide (DABMeOH)<br>
(0.42.10"3 moles of DABMe(OH)/g). Then 1.743 g of GeO2<br>
are added. The mixture is stirred and the ethanol formed<br>
in the hydrolysis of the TEOS evaporates and 51.1 g of<br>
water. The resulting mixture is heated at 150°C in<br>
autoclaves coated inside with PTFE. After 12 days of<br>
heating the mixture is filtered and 26 g of crystalline<br>
material per 100 g of synthesis gel are obtained. The X-<br>
ray diffraction pattern of the synthesized crystalline<br>
material coincides with the one given in Table I.<br>

are added. The mixture is stirred and the ethanol formed<br>
in the hydrolysis of the TEOS evaporates and 26.0 g of<br>
water. Finally 0.075 g of zeolite ITQ-17 (Si/Ge = 2.5)<br>
as a seed are added. The resulting mixture is heated at<br>
150°C in autoclaves coated inside with PTFE. After 6<br>
days of heating the mixture is filtered and the product<br>
obtained is dried at 100°C for 12 hours. The final solid<br>
is roasted at 540°C for 3 hours to eliminate the organic<br>
matter.<br>

azoniumbicyclo [2,2,2] octane) methyl]benzene hydroxide<br>
(d-DABBz(OH)2)(0.35.10-3 moles of DABBz (OH)2/g) . Then<br>
0.871 g of GeO2 are added. The mixture is stirred and the<br>
ethanol formed in the hydrolysis of the TEOS evaporates<br>
and 13.4 g of water. Finally 0.09g of zeolite ITQ-17<br>
(Si/Ge =5) as a seed are added. The resulting mixture is<br>
