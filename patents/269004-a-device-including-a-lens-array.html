				<td>The present invention relates to a novel device making it easier to provide an<br>
evaluation and/or advice in the field of cosmetics, and possibly relates to the use of certain<br>
compositions.<br>
European patent application EP 1 216 658 A1 discloses a method of evaluating a<br>
characteristic of the typology of the body.<br>
The method is adapted to be implemented using computer means, thereby<br>
implying, at the very least, the availability of a terminal on which the images can be<br>
displayed.<br>
US patent application No. 2005/0152041 describes a method of manufacturing<br>
images that are visible through a lens array, and that are suitable for appearing on different<br>
products such as a receptacle, a cup, a label, or a package, for example.<br>
US patent application No. 5 695 346 also describes a method of manufacturing<br>
images that are visible through a lens array.<br>
US patent No. 4 561 850 describes a device that enables a user to select the colors<br>
of different cosmetics as a function of the color of the user's skin and eyes.<br>
The invention seeks to make available to consumers and professionals, novel tools<br>
for making it easier to evaluate a characteristic of body typology and/or for making it<br>
easier to select a makeup effect or a treatment, or else to make it easier to use a<br>
composition or a device, inter alia.<br>
In one of its aspects, the invention provides a device comprising:<br>
•	at least two images showing at least two different appearances of keratinous<br>
materials, each of the images including an identifier; and<br>
•	an optical system that is configured to make the different images appear in<br>
succession as a result of a change in the angle of observation of the device.<br>
The invention makes it possible to provide a tool that is relatively inexpensive and<br>
simple to use for multiple applications in cosmetics.<br>
The expression "keratinous materials" covers the skin of the body or of the face,<br>
keratinous fibers such as the hair, eyelashes, or eyebrows, the nails, and the lips.<br>
An image can correspond to the local or overall appearance, possibly enlarged or<br>
reduced, of a large or small region of the body or of the face, the image being suitable for<br>
showing only a portion of the face, the entire face, and/or a portion of the body, indeed the<br>
entire individual, for example.<br>
The images need not all be to the same scale, e.g. could be at different<br>
magnifications.<br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a device comprising:<br>
•	at least two images showing at least two different appearances of keratinous<br>
materials and each including an identifier; and<br><br>
•	means enabling the different images to appear in succession at the same location<br>
on the device.<br>
The means may be an optical system or any mechanical system that makes it<br>
possible to substitute one image for another.<br>
The change in the appearance of the keratinous materials from one image to<br>
another, when the angle of observation changes, may be progressive, e.g. displaying at<br>
least one intermediate image that does not have an identifier between two images that<br>
include identifiers.<br>
The optical system advantageously includes a lens array. Printed or photographic<br>
image data corresponding to the images to be observed through the lens array, are<br>
disposed behind the lens array. The image data may include interleaved strips of images,<br>
with interleaving being selected as a function of the optical characteristics of the lens<br>
array.<br>
The lenses of the lens array concentrate the view on different portions of the image<br>
data, thereby enabling the images to appear selectively as a function of the angle of<br>
observation.<br>
The images may show at least two different degrees of a characteristic of the<br>
keratinous materials. By way of example, this characteristic may be selected from:<br>
•	characteristics relating to aging such as: number and depth of wrinkles; sagging of<br>
the skin, in particular of the neck; number and depth of folds, in particular of the neck;<br>
creasing of the skin; depth of dark rings; level of cellulite; ptosis; and age spots on the<br>
skin;<br>
•	physical or morphological characteristics such as: number and size of<br>
corneoparticles of the skin; sebum secretion level; sweat secretion level; dryness of the<br>
skin or the lips; length, curvature, or density of the eyelashes or the hair; blood supply of<br>
the skin; pigmentation defect; density of blackheads; acne; blotches; moles; outline of the<br>
lips; and<br>
•	color of the skin or of the hair; typology of the eyelashes or of other portions of<br>
the face or of the body; color of the teeth; or color of eye lenses, this list not being<br>
limiting.<br>
The images of the device can make it possible to identify at least one image that<br>
corresponds to a degree that is real or that is desired by the subject, with the retained<br>
image then serving, for example, as an objective to be achieved as a result of a treatment,<br>
or in assessing the effectiveness of a treatment.<br>
The different images may show different makeup effects for the body or for the<br>
face, e.g. different makeup effects for the lips, or the eyelashes, or they may show<br>
different associations of makeup effects for various portions of the face and/or of the body.<br><br>
The different images may also show various hair styles or different hair colorings.<br>
The device may include more than three images, indeed more than ten images, e.g.<br>
ten to thirty images.<br>
The identifier present on at least one image may include at least one alphanumeric<br>
character, e.g. a score, when it is for evaluating some degree of a body-typology<br>
characteristic; an age, in particular an apparent age; a reference to a composition when the<br>
images that appear correspond, for example, to applying different compositions, or to a<br>
duration, e.g. so as to show the effect of a treatment over time.<br>
The identifier may also comprise a marker, e.g. an arrow, the marker being<br>
associated with a scale that may be situated outside the optical system.<br>
The scale may include a plurality of score, age, or duration values, or references to<br>
different compositions or conditions of use for the compositions.<br>
The device may possibly include an opening making it possible to juxtapose<br>
keratinous materials and the image that is observed on the device. By way of example,<br>
such an opening may be useful for evaluating the appearance of the skin by making it<br>
possible to observe the skin and an image to be compared with the portion of skin that is<br>
visible through the opening.<br>
The device may possibly be associated with at least one composition, and the<br>
identifier may give information about the use of the composition.<br>
The device may be present on a package of a cosmetic composition or of a food<br>
supplement, e.g. so as to make it possible to evaluate the subject prior to using the<br>
composition or food supplement, with the conditions of application and/or the directions<br>
for use possibly depending on the prior evaluation, for example.<br>
In a variant, the presence of the device on the package may inform the user about<br>
the effects of the treatment over time.<br>
The invention also provides a method of evaluating a body-typology characteristic,<br>
in which method at least one image of a device as defined above is identified following a<br>
comparison with a subject being evaluated.<br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a cosmetic treatment in which<br>
at least one image of a device as defined above is identified, and a treatment is performed<br>
as a function of the image thus identified.<br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a method of demonstrating an<br>
effect of a cosmetic treatment, in which method at least one image of a device as defined<br>
above is identified prior to the treatment, the treatment is performed, then at least one<br>
other image of the device is identified, and, by comparing the images identified both<br>
before and after treatment, information is deduced about the effectiveness of said<br>
treatment.<br><br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a method of manufacturing a<br>
device as defined above, in which method:<br>
•	at least one image of keratinous materials of a subject is received from said<br>
subject, or at least one image of keratinous materials of said subject is acquired;<br>
•	at least one additional image, in which the appearance of the keratinous materials<br>
is modified, is generated at least on the basis of the image thus received or acquired; and<br>
•	a device as defined above, or a similar device, is produced, the images optionally<br>
being suitable for including identifiers in this aspect of the invention, the device including<br>
at least the additional image thus generated.<br>
The additional image(s) may be generated by image synthesis, e.g. by morphing, so<br>
as to make a treatment effect or a makeup effect appear, inter alia.<br>
Thus, in an implementation of the invention, from an image of the face of a<br>
subject, a plurality of images are generated that correspond to different makeup effects or<br>
to different treatments, or indeed to different stages of a treatment, thereby helping the<br>
subject to select a makeup effect or to decide for or against a treatment.<br>
The initial image that is received from or taken of the subject, and from which the<br>
additional image(s) are generated, may optionally be included in the images of the device<br>
and may possibly be disposed outside the optical system.<br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a method that makes it<br>
possible to treat, in particular to treat cosmetically, an external portion of the body of an<br>
individual, the method comprising the following steps:<br>
•	generating, by means of a lens array, a sequence of images that simulate various<br>
degrees of at least one typological characteristic of an external portion of the body;<br>
•	enabling at least one image to be identified within the sequence that substantially<br>
corresponds to some degree of said characteristic; and<br>
•	determining a treatment for the external portion as a function of said at least one<br>
identified image.<br>
In another of its aspects, the invention also provides a method that makes it<br>
possible to evaluate a treatment for an external portion of the body of an individual, the<br>
method comprising the following steps:<br>
•	generating, by means of a lens array, a sequence of images that simulate various<br>
degrees of at least one characteristic of an external portion of the body;<br>
•	enabling at least one image to be identified within the sequence that substantially<br>
corresponds to some degree of said at least one characteristic before treatment;<br>
•	treating said external portion of the body of the individual;<br>
•	enabling a further identification and evaluation to be performed after the<br>
treatment; and<br>
•	enabling the before and after treatment evaluations to be compared.<br><br>
The invention can be better understood on reading the following detailed<br>
description of non-limiting embodiments thereof, and on examining the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
•	Figure 1 shows various images being displayed with the corresponding identifiers,<br>
in an example of a device constituting an embodiment of the invention;<br>
•	Figure 2 is a diagrammatic and fragmentary cross-section of a lens array that is<br>
suitable for being used as an optical system in the Figure 1 device;<br>
•	Figure 3 shows the use of the device associated with a package;<br>
•	Figure 4 shows another example of identifiers;<br>
•	Figure 5 shows a production line enabling a personalized device to be made;<br>
•	Figures 6 and 7 show examples of devices for making it easier to choose a<br>
composition or conditions of application;<br>
•	Figure 8 shows an example of a packaging and applicator device that is suitable<br>
for being associated with a device as shown in Figure 7;<br>
•	Figures 9 and 10 show examples of images with which examples of devices<br>
constituting embodiments of the invention can be made; and<br>
•	Figure 11 shows another example of a device.<br>
The device 1 shown in Figures 1 and 2 includes a lens array, of structure known<br>
per se. comprising juxtaposed lenses 3 of small size, each of which is constituted by a<br>
cylindrical lens, for example.<br>
The lens array 2 can thus present an outer surface that is fluted, the number of<br>
lenses 3 per inch being greater than or equal to 50, for example.<br>
The lenses 3 of the lens array 2 are made out of a layer 8 of a thermoplastic<br>
material, for example.<br>
The layer 8 made of transparent plastics material can present a smooth rear face 4,<br>
and can be fastened on a substrate 5, e.g. a sheet of paper, on which there has been printed<br>
image data in the form of interleaved strips, said interleaving being selected as a function<br>
of the optical characteristics of the lens array, such that, for a first direction of observation,<br>
only the image data corresponding to one of the images to be restored appears to the<br>
observer, and for other directions of observation, it is different image data, associated with<br>
other images to be displayed, that appears.<br>
Lens arrays as such are widely known and varied, and reference could be made to<br>
US publications Nos. 6 751 024, 6 414 794, 6 781 761, 6 984 425, and 6 795 250, all of<br>
which disclose other configuration examples.<br>
In a variant not shown, the image data is printed directly onto the rear face of the<br>
layer made of transparent plastics material of the lens array.<br><br>
The device 1 can be made in such a manner that, for example, three to thirty<br>
images can appear in succession when the angle of observation of the device is changed,<br>
as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Each image can include an identifier that enables the observer to identify the image<br>
being observed. In a variant, only some of the images include an identifier, the other<br>
images not having an identifier and serving to provide transitions that are agreeable to the<br>
eye between those images that have identifiers.<br>
By way of example, each identifier is a marker 10 that, when the angle of<br>
observation of the device changes, moves along a scale 11 of the device including other<br>
mentions, as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The identifier 10 can also be at least one alphanumeric character e.g. a score, as<br>
shown in Figure 4.<br>
A device made in accordance with the invention can be used on a package 20, as<br>
shown in Figure 3, e.g. a package made of cardboard.<br>
Where appropriate, the transparent plastics material layer of the lens array can be<br>
made integrally with a receptacle or a box containing the composition.<br>
The images that can be observed on the device can be made in various ways, e.g.<br>
being real photographs, synthesized images, drawings, or a mixture thereof.<br>
For example, at least some images can be generated by morphing in order to<br>
simulate the change, with age, in one or more body-typology characteristics.<br>
An example of simulating the appearance of the face with age is described in the<br>
French patent application filed under No. 04 10323.<br>
Figure 9 shows an image sequence 30 simulating the aging process of the face of a<br>
woman, with, on each of the images, an identifier constituted by the age that is taken to<br>
correspond to the appearance of the woman on the image.<br>
It is possible to decompose only the images shown in Figure 9 to constitute image<br>
data in such a manner as to cause only those images to appear in succession, through the<br>
lens array, when the angle of observation of the device varies. In a variant, other images<br>
are interposed between the images shown in Figure 9, which other images do not have<br>
identifiers, but present features of the subject that are intermediate between the features of<br>
the closest images that are provided with identifiers.<br>
Figure 6 shows the possibility of using the device 1 to make a plurality of makeup<br>
results appear, e.g. eye makeup, the identifier indicating the commercial reference of the<br>
mascara to be used to obtain the displayed result, for example.<br>
Figure 7 shows the possibility of making a plurality of makeup results appear, by<br>
means of the device 1, as a function of a particular adjustment of a packaging device, as<br>
shown in Figure 8, for example. The packaging device 50 includes an adjustment member<br><br>
51 that makes it possible to vary the relative proportions of two components of a cosmetic<br>
used to create a makeup effect, thereby changing the appearance.<br>
The device 1 can indicate to the user the appearance that is likely to be obtained for<br>
different settings of the device 50, e.g. marked by identifiers 52 that are the same as the<br>
identifiers 10 incorporated in the images that are likely to be seen by means of the device<br>
1.<br>
Figure 10 shows different degrees of aging of the skin, with the appearance of<br>
blemishes on the skin as a function of age.<br>
The images can be useful in enabling the observer to evaluate the degree of aging<br>
of the observer's skin, or to understand better the appearance of signs of ageing, and to<br>
decide, for example, on the application of a care product for delaying or alleviating the<br>
effects of ageing.<br>
In the embodiment in Figure 11, the device includes an opening 60 that makes it<br>
possible to see an underlying area of skin. The different images that appear as a function<br>
of the angle of observation can thus be compared with the area of skin appearing through<br>
the opening 60. By way of example, the different images may be different skin colors, the<br>
images being produced with inks selected to minimize the phenomenon of metamerism,<br>
for example.<br>
The invention is not limited to the various examples described above. In particular,<br>
it is possible to make the device 1 with means other than an optical system for making a<br>
plurality of images appear at the same location, e.g. a mechanical system that makes it<br>
possible to move the images relative to one another.<br>
Where appropriate, the device of the invention could be proposed to the consumer<br>
with a diagnostic tool that makes it possible to stress the skin mechanically, biologically,<br>
or chemically, or that makes it possible to observe the skin under special lighting or with a<br>
given magnification, for example.<br>
The device 1 could be packaged within a single package with at least one<br>
composition for application to the skin or the hair, or with at least one food supplement.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the device is made with at least one image<br>
received from a subject or taken of said subject.<br>
For example, a consumer can transmit an image of the consumer's face to an<br>
internet site by means of a terminal 40, and the site can transmit the image to a<br>
manufacturing unit 60, as shown in Figure 5.<br>
By way of example, the terminal 40 is a phone camera, a webcam, a digital camera,<br>
or a video camera. In a variant embodiment of the invention, an image of the individual is<br>
sent to the manufacturing unit by post.<br><br>
In another variant of the invention, an image of the individual is acquired at a point<br>
of sale or on the premises of a professional, and the image can be transmitted to the<br>
manufacturing unit. The image can also be present at the point of sale.<br>
The manufacturing unit 60 is configured to generate at least one additional image<br>
from the received image, e.g. by morphing, so as to end up with a device 1 on which the<br>
user can perceive the effects of a treatment or the appearance of modifications resulting<br>
from different types of makeup effects, hair styles, or hair colorings, for example.<br>
The received image can optionally be integrated in the device 1.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.<br>
The expression "comprising a" should be understood as being synonymous with<br>
"comprising at least one" unless specified to the contrary.<br><br>
