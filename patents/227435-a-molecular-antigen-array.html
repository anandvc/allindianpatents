It is generally difficult to induce unmune responses against self-molecules due<br>
to immunological tolerance. Specifically, lymphocytes with a specificity for self-molecules are usually hypo- or even unresponsive if triggered by conventional vaccination strategies.<br>
The amyloid B peptide (Ab^) has a central role is Ae neuropathology of Alzheimers disease. Region specific, extracellular accumuIatioB of A pq}tide is accompanied by microgliosis, cytoskeletal changes, dystrophic netrits and synaptic loss. These pathological alterations are thought to be linked to the cognitiive decline that defines the disease.<br>
In a mouse model of Alzheimer disease, transgenic animals engineered to produce AP1-42 (FDAFP-mice), develop plaques and neuron damage in their brain. Recent  work has shown immunization of young PDAFP-mice, using AP1-42 resulted in inhibition of plague formation and associated dystrqphic neuritis (Schenk, D. et ol., Nature 400:173-77 (1999)).<br><br>
It is well established that the administration of purified proteins alone is usually not sufficient to elicit a strong immune response; isolated antigen generally<br><br>
must be given together with helper substances called adjuvants. Within these adjuvants, the administered antigen is protected against rapid degradation and the adjuvant provides an extended release of a low level of antigen.<br>
As indicated, one of the key events in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid as insoluble fibrous masses (amyloidogenesis) resulting in extracellular neuritic plaques and deposits around the walls of cerebral blood vesssels (for review see Selkoe, D. J. (1999) Nature. 399, A23-31). The major constituent of the neuritic plaques and congophilic angiopathy is amylold 6 (AS), although these deposits also contain other proteins such as glycosaminogjycans and apolipoproteins.<br><br>
We have surprisingly found that self-molecules or self-antigens presented m a highly ordered and repetitive array were able to efficiently induce self-specific immune-responses, in particular antibody responses. Moreover such responses could even be induced in the absence of adjuvants that otherwise non-specifically activate antigen presenting cells and other immune cells.<br><br>

Further aspects as well as preferred embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following as well as. in particular, in the light of the detailed description, the examples and the accompanying claims.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the core particle is a viruslike particle comprising recombinant proteins of a RNA-phage, preferably selected from the group consisting of a) bacteriophage QP; b) bacteriophage R17; c) bacteriophage fr; d) bacteriophage GA; e) bacteriophage SP; f) bactraiophage MS2; g) bacteriophage Ml 1; h) bacteriophage MXl; i) bacteriophage NL95; k) bacteriophage f2; and 1) bacteriophage PP7. Most preferred are bacteriophage QP and bacteriophage ft.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant proteins of the RNA-phages comprise wild type coat proteins.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or alternatively consists of, pili or pilus-like structures that have bera either produced from pilin proteins or harvested from bacteria. When pili or pilus-like structures are used to prepare compositions of the invention, they may be formed from products of pilin genes which are naturally resident in the bacterial cells but have been modified<br><br>
by graetically engineered (e.g,, by homologous recombination) or pilin genes which have been introduced into these cells.<br>
In a related embodiment, the core particle comprises, or alternatively consists of, pili or pilus-like structures that have been either prepared from pilin proteins or harvested from bacteria. These core particles may be formed from products of pilin genes naturally resident in the bacterial cells.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the organizer may comprise at least one first attachment site. The first and the second attachment sites are particularly important elements of compositions of the invention. In various embodiments of the invention, the first and/or the second attachment site may be an antigen and an antibody or antibody fragment thereto; biotin and avidin; strepavidin and biotin; a receptor and its ligand; a ligand-binding protein and its ligand; interacting leucine zipper polypeptides; an amino group and a chemical group reactive thereto; a carboxyl group and a chemical group reactive thereto; a sulfhydryl group and a chiemical group<br><br>
An important property of glycine and glycine serine linkers is their flexibility, in particular their structural flexibility, allowing a wide range of conformations and disfavoring folding into structures precluding accessibility of the second attachment<br><br>
site. As glycine and glycine serine linkers contain either no or a limited amount ot side chain residues, they have limited tendency for engagement into extensive interactions with the antigen, thus, further ensuring accessibility of the second attachment site. Serine residues within the glycine serine linkers confer improved solubility properties to these linkers. Accordingly, the insertion of one or two amino acids either in tandem or isolation, and in particular of polar or charged amino acid residues, in the glycine or glycine serine amino acid linker, is also encompassed by the teaching of the invention.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the antigen may be selected from die groiq) consisting of: (1) a protein suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (2) a protein suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases; (3) a protein suited to induce an immune response against allergens; (4) a protein suited to induce an inproved response against self-antigens; and (5) a protein suited to induce an immune response in farm animals or pets. In another embodiment, the first attachment site and/or the second attachment site are selected from the group comprising: (1) a genetically engineered lysine residue and (2) a genetically engineered cysteine residue, two residues that may be chemically linked together.<br><br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment, first attachment site comprises or is an amino group and said second attachment site comprises or is a sulfhydryl group. Preferably, the first attachment site comprises or is a lysine residue and said second attachment site comprises or is a cysteine residue.<br><br>
la a still further aspect, the present invea&amp;xi iHX)vides a coniposition c6nq&gt;rising a bactmophage QP coat protein attached by a covafcot bond to phospholipase A% protein, or a fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the phospbolipase A2 protein, or a fragment thereof, and the bacteriophage Q coat protem interact through the covalent bond to form an ordered and repetitive antigen array. In another prepared embodiment, the covalent bond is not a peptide bond. In another preferred embodiment,the  phospholipase A2 protein includes an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 168, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 169, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:170, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:171, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br><br>
NO: 172, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 173, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 174, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 175.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of making the composition compising combbining the bacteriophage QP coat protein and the phospholipase A2 protein, wherein the bacteriophage QP coat protein and the phospholipase A2 protem mteract to form an antigen array. .<br><br>
The present mvention also provides a method cf treating an allargy to bee venom, comprising administering the pharmaceutical composition or the vaccine composition to a subject As a result of such administration the subject exhibits a decreased immune response to the venom.<br>
The mvention also relates to a vaccine for the prevention of prion-mediated diseases by induction of anti-lymphotoxinP, anti-lymphotoxina or anti-<br><br>
lymphotoxin P-receptor antibodies. The vaccine contains protein carries foreign to the immunized human or animal coupled to lymphotoxin or fragments thereof, lymphotoxina or fragments thereof or the lymphoxinp receptor or fragments thereof The vaccine is injected in humans or animals in order to induce antibodies specific for endogenous lymphotoxm^, lymphotoxina or IymphotoxinP receptor. These induced anti-lymphotoxin^, lymphotoxina anti-lymphotoxin receptor antibodies reduce or eliminate the pool of follicular dendritic cells present in lymphoid organs. Smce prion-replication in lymphoid organs and transport to the central nervous system aire impaired in the absence of follicular deaidritic cells, Ms treatment inhibits progression of prion-mediated disease. Jn addition, blocking lymphotoxinp is beneficial for patients with autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I<br><br>

Association: As used herein, the term "association" as it applies to the first and second attachment sites, refers to at least one hon-peptide bond. The nature of the association may be covalent, ionic, hydrophobic, polar or any combination thereof<br>
Attachment Site, First As used herein, the phrase "first attachment site" refers to an element of the "organizer", itself bound to the core particle in a non-random fashion, to which the second attachment site located on the antigen or antigenic determinant may associate. The first attachment site may be a protein, a polypeptide, an amino acid, a peptide, a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenyhnethylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination theof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. Multiple first attachment sites are present on the surface of the non-natural molecular scaffold in a repetitive configuration.<br><br>
all-D or mixtures thereof. However, an amino acid linker comprising a molecule with a sulfhydryl group or cysteine residue is also encompassed within the invention. Such a molecule comprise preferably a C1-C6 alkyl-, cycloalkyl (C5,C6), aryl or heteroaryl moiety. Association between the antigen or antigenic determinant or optionally the<br><br>
second attachment site and the amino acid linker is preferably by way of at least one covalent bond, more preferably by way of at least one peptide bond.<br>
Bound: As used herein, the term "bound" refers to binding or attachment that may be covalent, e.g., by chemically coupling, or non-covalent, e.g., ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, amide, peptide, imide, caibon-sulfur bonds, carbon-phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term "bound" is broader than and includes terms such as "coupled," "fused" and "attached".<br>
Core particle: As used herein, the term "core particle" refers to a rigid structure with an inherent repetitive organization that provides a foundation for attachment of an "organizer". A core particle as used herein may be the product of a synthetic process or the product of a biological process.<br><br>
refers to a second nucleotide sequence present in a vector of the invention, The term "heterologous sequence" also refers to any amino acid or RNA sequence encoded by a heterologous DNA sequence contained in a vector of the invention. Heterologous nucleotide sequences can encode proteins or RNA molecules normally expressed in the cell type in which ihey are present or molecules not normally expressed therein {e.g,y Sindbis structural proteins).<br><br>
Isolated: As used herein, when the term "isolated" is used in reference to a molecule, the term means that the molecule has been removed from its native environment. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present in a living animal is not "isolated," but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is "isolated." Further, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA replication products of DNA and RNA molecules. Isolated nucleic acid molecules further include synthetically produced molecules. Additionally, vector molecules contained in recombinant host cells are also isolated Thus, not all "isolated" molecules need be "purified."<br>
Immunotherapeutic: As used herein, the term "immunotherapeutic" is a composition for the treatment of diseases or disorders. More specifically, the term is used to refer to a method of treatment for allergies or a method of treatment for<br><br>
elsewhere herein.<br><br>
Natural origin: As used herein, the tenn "natural origin" means that the whole or parts thereof are not synthetic and exist or are produced in nature.<br>
Non-natural: As used herein, the term generally means not from nature, more specifically, the term means from the hand of man.<br>
Non-natural origin: As used herein, the term "non-natural origin" generally means synthetic or not from nature; more specifically, the term means from the hand of man.<br><br>
polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmediylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. Therefore, the organizer further ensures formation of an ordered and repetitive antigen army in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention. In typical embodiments of the invention, the core particle is modified, e.g. by way of genetic engineering or chemical reaction, so as to generate a non-natural molecular scaffold comprising the core particle and the organizer, the latter being connected to the core particle by at least one covalent bond. In certain embodiments of the invention, however, the organizer is selected as being part of the core particle. Therefore, for those embodiments modification of the core particle is not necessarily needed to generate a non-natuiral molecular scaffold comprising the core particle and the organizer and to ensure the formation of an<br><br>
which often do not possess a defined three-dimensional structure, but rather can adopt a large number of different conformations, and are referred to as unfolded. The defined three-dimensionat structures of proteins is especially important for the association between the core particle and the antigen, mediated by the. second<br><br>
attachment site, and in particular by way of chemical cross-linking between the first and second attachment site using a chemical cross-linker. ITie amino acid linker is also intimately related to the structural properties of proteins in some aspects of the invention.<br>
Purified: As used herein, when the term "purified" is used in reference to a molecule, it means that the concentration of the molecule being purified has been increased relative to molecules associated with it in its natural environment Naturally associated molecules include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and sugars but generally do not include water, buffers, and reagents added to maintain the integrity or facilitate the purification of the molecule being purified.  For example, even if<br><br>
Restrictive temperature: As used herein, the phrase "restrictive temperature" refers to temperatures at which an enzyme has low or undetectable levels of catalytic activity. Both "hot" and "cold" sensitive mutants are known and, thus, a restrictive temperature may be higher or lower than a pennissive temperature.<br>
RNA-dependent RNA replication event: As used herein, the phrase "RNA-dependent RNA replication event" refers to processes which result in the formation of an RNA molecule using an RNA molecule as a template.<br><br>
RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase:. As used herein, the phrase "RNA-<br>
Dependent RNA polymerase" refers to a polymerase which catalyzes the production<br>
of an RNA molecule from another RNA molecule.   This term is used herein<br>
synonymously with the term "replicase."<br>
RNA-phage: As used herein, the term "RNA-phage" refers to RNA viruses<br>
infecting bacteria, preferably to single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses infecting<br>
bacteria.<br><br>
Virus-like particle: As used herein, the term "virus-like particle" refers to a structure resembling a virus particle. Moreover, a virus-like particle in accordance v/ith the invention is non replicative and noninfectious since it lacks all or part of the viral genome, in particular the replicative and infectious components of the viral genome. A virus-like particle in accordance with the invention may contain nucleic acid distinct from their genome.<br><br>
Virus-like particle of a bacteriophage: As used herein, the term virus-like particle of a bacteriophage" refers to a virus-like particle resembling the structure of a bacteriophage, being non replicative and noninfectious, and lacking at least the gene or genes encoding for the replication machinery of the bacteriophage, and typically also lacking the gene or genes encoding the protein or proteins responsible for viral attachment to or entry into the host. This definition should, however, also encompass virus-like particles of bacteriophages, in which the aforementioned gene or genes are still present but inactive, and, therefore, also leading to non-replicative and noninfectious virus-like particles of a bacteriophage.<br><br>
The non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or alternatively consists of: (a) a core particle selected from the group consisting of (1) a core particle of non-natural origin and (2) a core particle of natural origin; and (b) an organizer comprising at<br><br>
least one first attachment site, wherein said organizer is connected to said core particle by at least one covalent bond.<br>
Compositions of the invention also comprise, or alternatively consist of, core particles to which antigens or antigenic determinants are directly linked.<br>
The antigen or antigenic determinant has at least one second attachment site which is selected from the group consisting of (a) an attachment site not naturally occurring with said antigen or antigenic determinant; and (b) an attachment site naturally occurring with said antigen or antigenic determinant<br>
The invention provides for an ordered and repetitive antigen array through an association of the second attachment site to the first attachment site by way of at least one non-peptide bond. Thus, the antigen or antigenic determinant and the non-natural<br><br>

A.      Core Particles and Non-Natural Molecular Scaffolds<br>
One element in certain compositions of the invention is a non-natural molecular scaffold comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a core particle and an organizer. As used herein, the phrase "non-natural molecular scaffold" refers to any product made by the hand of man that may serve to provide a li^d and repetitive array of first attachment sites. More specifically, the non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or alternatively consists of, (a) a core particle selected firom the group consisting of (1) a core particle of non-natural origin and (2) a core particle of natural<br><br>

By way of example, this type of embodiment may includes a core particle comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a virus, virus-like particle, a bacterial pilus, a phage, a viral capsid particle or a recombinant form thereof. In a more specific embodiment, the core particle may comprise, or alternatively consist of, recombinant proteins of Rotavirus, recombinant proteins of Norwalk virus, recombinant proteins of Alphavirus, recombinant proteins which form bacterial pili or pilus-like structures, recombinant proteins of Foot and Mouth Disease<br><br>
65, 70, 75, 80, 85,90, 95, 100. 110,120, 130,140, 150, 160, 170, 180,190, or 200 amino acids in length. Examples of such protein fragments include fragments of proteins discussed herein which are suitable for the preparation of core particles and/or non-natural molecular scaffolds.<br><br>
Whether natural or non-natural, the core particle of the invention will generally have an organizer that is attached to the natural or non-natural core particle by at least one covalent bond. The organizer is an element bound to a core particle in a non-random fashion that provides a nucleation site for creating an ordered and repetitive antigen array. Ideally, but not necessarily, the organizer is associated with the core particle in a geometric order.  Minimally, the organizer comprises a first<br><br>
{e.g. vesicular stomatitis virus), picomaviruses (e.g., human rhino virus, Aidii virus), togaviruses (e.g., rubella virus), orthomyxoviruses {e.g., Thqgoto virus, Batken virus, fowl plague virus), polyomaviruses {e.g., polyomavirus BK, polyomavirus JC, avian polyomavirus BFDV), parvoviruses, rotaviruses, bacteriophage Qp, bacteriophage R17, bacteriophage Mil, bacteriophage MXl, bacteriophage NL95, bacteriophage fr.<br><br>
bacteriophage GA, bacteriophage SP, bacteriophage MS2, bacteriophage f2, bacteriophage PP7, Norwalk virus, foot and mouth disease virus, a retrovirus, Hepatitis B virus.

In one embodiment, the invention utilizes genetic engineering of a virus to create a fusion between an ordered and repetitive viral envelope protein and an organizer comprising a heterologous protein, peptide, antigenic determinant or a reactive amino acid residue of choice. Other genetic manipulations known to those in the art may be included in the construction of the non-natural molecular scaffold; for<br><br>

A variety of different recombinant host cells can be utilized to produce a viral-based core particle for antigen or antigenic determinant attachment.  For example.<br><br>
Alphaviruses are known to have a wide host range; Sindbis virus infects cultured mammalian, reptilian, and amphibian cells, as well as some insect cells (Clark, H., J. Natl Cancerlnst 5i :645 (1973); Leake, C, /. Gen. Virol 55:335 (1977); StoIIar, V. in THE TOGAVIRUSES, R.W. Schlesinger, Ed., Academic Piess, (1980), pp.583-621). Thus, numerous recombinant host cells can be used in the practice of the invention. BHK, COS, Vero, HeLa and CHO cells are particularly suitable for the production of heterologous proteins because they have the potential to glycosylate heterologous proteins in a manner similar to human cells (Watson, E. et al, Gfycobiology 4:227, (1994)) and can be selected (Zang, M. et al., Bio/Technology 15:389 (1995)) or genetically engineered (Renner W. et al, Biotech, Bioeng. 4:476 (1995); Lee K.etaL Biotech. Bioeng. 50:336 (1996)) to grow in serum-free medium, as well as in suspension.<br><br>
As will be understood by those in the art, the first attachment site may be or be a part of any suitable protein, polypeptide, sugar, polynucleotide, peptide (amino acid), natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or combination thereof<br><br>
that may serve to specifically attach the antigen or antigenic detenninant of choice to the non-natural molecular scaffold. In one embodiment, the attachment site is a protein or peptide that may be selected from those known in the art. For example, the first attachment site may selected from the following group: a ligand, a receptor, a lectin, avidin, streptavidin, biotin, an epitope such as an HA or T7 tag, Myc, Max, immunoglobulin domains and any other amino acid sequence known in the art that would be useful as a first attachment site.<br><br>
following:<br>
CGGRIARLEEKVKTLKAQNSEIASTANMIREQVAQLQKVM (SEQ ID NO:59)<br>
In this instance, the anticipated second attachment site on the antigen would be the FOS leucine zipper protein domain and the amino acid sequence would be the following:<br><br>
CGGLTDTLQAETDQVEDEKSAIiJTEIANlIJKEm (SEQ ID NO:60)<br>
These sequences are derived from the transcription factors JUN and FOS, each flanked with a short sequence containing a cysteine residue on both sides. These sequences are known to interact with each other. The original hypothetical structure proposed for the JUN-FOS dimer assumed that the hydrophobic side chains of one monomer interdigitate with the respective side chains of the oth^ monomer in a zipper-like manner (Landschulz et aL, Science 240:1159-1164 (1988)). However, this hypothesis proved to be wrong, and these proteins are known to form an a-helical coiled coil (O'Shea et al.. Science 245:538-542 (1989); O'Shea et al., CeU 5S:699-708 (1992); Cohen &amp; Parry, Trends Biochem, Sci. 11:245-248 (1986)). Thus, tte term "leucine zipper" is frequently used to refer to these protein domains for more<br><br>
al. (/. Virol 55:5393-5398 (1992)) demonstrated that HBcAgs which have been modified to remove the naturally resident cysteine residues retain the ability to associate and form multimeric structures. Thus, core particles suitable for use in compositions of the invention include those comprising modified HBcAgs, or<br><br>
fragments thereof, in which one or more of the naturally resident cysteine residues have been either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue {e,g,, a serine residue).<br>
2	The HBcAg is a protein generated by the processing of a Hepatitis B<br>
core antigen precursor protein. A number of isotypes of the HBcAg have been identified. For example, the HBcAg protein having the amino add sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 132 is 183 amino acids in length and is generated by the processing of a 212 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. This processing results in the removal of 29 amino acids from the N-tenninus of the Hepatitis B cote antigen precursor protein. Similarly, the HBcAg protein having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 is 185 amino acids in length and is generated by the processing of a 214 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein.  Hie<br><br>
have been either deleted or substituted with other amino acid residues (e.g., a serine residue). As one skilled in the art would recognize, cysteine residues at similar locations in HBcAg variants having amino acids sequences which differ from that shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 could also be deleted or substituted with<br><br>
other amino acid residues.  The modified HBcAg variants can then be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
The present invention also includes HBcAg variants which have been modified to delete or substitute one or more additional cysteine residues which are not found in polypeptides having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134. Examples of such HBcAg variants have the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs:90 and 132. These variant contain cysteines residues at a position corresponding to amino acid residue 147 in SEQ JD NO: 134. Thus, the vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions comprising HBcAgs in which cysteine residues not present in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ<br><br>
a strong tendency to bind nucleic acids. Detection of such toxic products in antigen-capsid conjugates would be difficult using capsids prepared using HBcAgs containing free cysteines and heterobifunctional cross-linkers, since a distribution of products with a broad range of molecular weight would be<br><br>
generated. Tlie toxic adducts would thus be distributed between a multiplicity of species, which individually may each be present at low concentration, but reach toxic levels when together.<br>
In view of the above, one advantage to the use of HBcAgs in vaccine compositions which have been modified to remove naturally resident cysteine residues is that sites to which toxic species can bind when antigens or antigenic determinants are attached to the non-natural molecular scaffold would be reduced in number or eliminated altogether. Further, a high concentration of cross-linker can be used to produce highly decorated particles without the drawback of generating a plurality of undefined cross-linked species of HBcAg monomers (z.e., a diverse mixture of cross-linked monomeric HbcAgs),<br><br>
herein by reference.  These HBcAg variants dijBfer in amino add sequmce at a number of positions, including amino acid residues which corresponds to the<br><br>
amino acid residues located at positions 12,13,21. 22,24, 29,32,33,35,38,40, 42, 44, 45, 49, 51, 57, 58, 59. 64, 66, 67, 69, 74. 77. 80, 81, 87, 92. 93, 97, 98, 100,103, 105, 106, 109, 113, 116, 121, 126, 130, 133, 135, 141, 147, 149, 157, 176,178,182 and 183 in SEQ ID NO:134.<br>
HBcAgs suitable for use in the present invention may be derived from any organism so long as they are able to associate to form an ordered and repetitive antigen array.<br>
As noted above, generally processed HBcAgs (i.e., those which lack leader sequences) will be used in the vaccine compositions of the invention. Thus, when HBcAgs having amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs:136, 137, or 138 are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, generally 30,35-43, or 35-43 amino acid residues at the N-terminus, respectively, of each of<br><br>
The HBcAg variants and precursors having the amino acid sequences set out in SEQ ID NOs:89-132 and 134-136 are relatively similar to each other. Thus, reference to an amino acid residue of a HBcAg variant located at a position<br><br>
which corresponds to a particular position in SEQ ID NO: 134, refers to the amino acid residue which is present at that position in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ E) NO: 134. The homology between these HBcAg variants is for the most part high enough among Hepatitis B viruses that infect mammals so that one skilled in the art would have little difficulty reviewing both the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 and that of a particular HBcAg variant and identifying "corresponding" amino acid residues. For example, the HBcAg amino acid sequence shown in SEQ E) NO: 135, which shows the amino add sequence of a HBcAg derived from a virus which infect woodchucks, has enough homology to the HBcAg having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 Aat it is readily apparent that a three amino acid residue insert is present in SEQ ID NO:135 between amino acid residues 155 and 156 of SEQ ID NO:134.<br><br>
As set out below in Example 31, the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107, which are accessible to solvent, may be removed, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis. Further, the inventors have found that the Cys-48-Ser,<br><br>
Cys-107-Ser HBcAg double mutant constructed as described in Example 31 can be expressed in E, coli<br>
As discussed above, the elimination of free cysteine residues reduces the number of sites where toxic components can bind to the HBcAg, and also eliminates sites where cross-linking of lysine and cysteine residues of the same or of neighboring HBcAg molecules can occur. The cysteine at position 61, which is involved in dimer formation and forms a disulfide bridge with the cysteine at position 61 of another HBcAg, will normally be left intact for stabilization of HBcAg dimers and multimers of the invention.<br><br>
The C-terminus of the HBcAg has been shown to direct nuclear localization of this protein.    (Eckhardt et cd,, /. Virol 55:575-582 (1991).)<br><br>
Further, this region of the protein is also believed to confer upon the HBcAg the ability to bind nucleic acids.<br>
In some embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention will contain HBcAgs which have nucleic acid binding activity (e.g„ which contain a naturally resident HBcAg nucleic acid binding domain). HBcAgs containing one or more nucleic acid binding domains are useful for preparing vaccine compositions which exhibit enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity. Thus, the vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which contain HBcAgs having nucleic acid binding activity. Further included are vaccine compositions, as well as the use of such compositions in vaccination protocols, where HBcAgs are bound to nucleic acids. These HBcAgs may bind to the nucleic acids prior to administration to an individual or may bind the nucleic acids<br><br>
residue is introduced as a first attachment site into a polypeptide which fomis the non-natural molecular scaffold. In preferred embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention are prepared using a HBcAg comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids 1-144 or amino acids 1-149 of SEQ ID NO: 134 which<br><br>
is modified so that the amino acids corresponding to positions 79 and 80 are replaced with a peptide having, the amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO: 158) and the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107 are either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue, while the cysteine at position 61 is left in place. The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising corresponding fragments of polypeptides having amino acid sequences shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:89-132 and 135-136 which also have fte above noted amino acid alterations.<br><br>
inserted or substituted). In most applications, however, only one type of a HBcAg, or at least HBcAgs having essentially equivalent first attachment sites, will be used because vaccines prepared using such HBcAgs will present highly ordered and repetitive arrays of antigens or antigenic determinants.   Further,<br><br>
preferred vaccine compositions of the invention are those which present highly ordered and repetitive antigen array<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions where the non-natural molecular scaffold is prepared using a HBcAg fused to another protein. As discussed above, one example of such a fusion protein is a HBcAg/FOS fusion. Other examples of HBcAg fusion proteins suitable for use in vaccine compositions of tihe invention include fusion proteins where an amino acid sequence has been added which aids in the formation and/or stabilization of HBcAg dimers and multimers. This additional amino add sequence may be fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the HBcAg. One example, of such a fudon protein is a fusion of a HBcAg with the GCN4 helix region of Saccharomyces<br><br>
In other embodiments, a bacterial pilin, a subportion of a bacteria pilin, or a fusion protein which contains either a bacterial pilin or subportioi thereof is used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention. Examples o pilin proteins include  pilins produced by Escherichia  coli,  Haemophilu<br><br>
influenzae^ Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudpmonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The amino acid sequences of pilin proteins suitable for use with the present invention include those set out in GenBank reports AJ000636 (SEQ ID NO: 139), AJ132364 (SEQ ID NO:140), AF229646 (SEQ ID N0:141X AF051814 (SEQ ID NO:142), AF051815 (SEQ ID NO:143), and X00981 (SEQ ID NO:155), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Bacterial pilin proteins are generally processed to remove N-t^minal leader sequences prior to export of the proteins into the bacterial p^iplasm. Furdier, as one skilled in the art would recognize, bacteriial pilin pratdns used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention will generally not have the<br><br>
Further, using, for example, conventional genetic engineering and protein modification methods, pilin proteins may be modified to contain a first attachment site to which an antigen or antigenic determinant is linked through a<br><br>
second attachment site. Alternatively, antigens or antigenic determinants can be directly linked through a second attachment site to amino acid residues which are naturally resident in these proteins. These modified pilin proteins may then be used in vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Bacterial pilin proteins used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention may be modified in a manner similar to that described herein for HBcAg. For example, cysteine and lysine residues may be either deleted or substituted with other amino acid residues and first attachment sites may be added to these proteins. Further, pilin proteins may either be expressed in modified form or may be chemically modified after expression.  Similarly, intact pili may be<br><br>
When structures which are naturally synthesized by organisms (e,g,, pili) are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, it will often be<br><br>
advantageous to genetically engineer these organisms so that they produce structures having desirable characteristics. For example, when Type-1 pili of E, coli are used, the E, coli from which these pili are harvested may be modified so as to produce structures with specific characteristics. Examples of possible modifications of pilm proteins include the insertion of one or more lysine residues, the deletion or substitution of one or more of the naturally resident lysine residues, and the deletion or substitution of one or more naturally resident cysteine residues (e.g., the cysteine residues at positions 44 and 84 in SEQ ID NO:146).<br><br>
generally be structures formed from a mixture of these pilin proteins. Further, when two or more pilin genes are expressed in a bacterial cell, the relative expression of each pilin gene will typically be the factor which determines the ratio of the different pilin subunits in the pili or pilus-like structures.<br><br>
When piK or pilus-like structures having a particular composition of mixed pilin subunits is desired, the expression of at least one of the pilin genes can be regulated by a heterologous, inducible promoter. Such promoters, as well as other genetic elements, can be used to regulate the relative amounts of different pilin subunits produced in the bacterial cell and, hence, the composition of the pili or pilus-like structures.<br>
In additional, while in most instances the antigen or antigenic determinant will be linked to bacterial pili or pilus-like structures by a bond which is not a peptide bond, bacterial cells which produce pili or pilus-like structures used in the compositions- of the invention can be genetically engineered to generate pilin proteins which are fused to an antigen or antigenic deterninanL Such fusion proteins which form pili or pilus-like structures are suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention.<br><br>
to prepare core particles and vaccine compositions of the invention. Bacteriophage Qp coat proteins, for example, can be expressed recombinantly in E. colu Further, upon such expression these proteins spontaneously form capsids. Additionally, these capsids form ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays which can be used for antigen presentation and the preparation of vaccine compositions. As described below in Example 38, bacteriophage QP<br><br>
coat proteins can be used to prepare vaccine compositions which elicit immunological responses to antigenic determinants.<br>
Specific examples of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used to prepare compositions of the invention include the coat proteins of RNA bacteriophages such as bacteriophage Qp (SEQ ID NO: 159; PIR Database, Accession No. VCBPQp referring to QP CP and SEQ ID NO: 217; Accession No. AAA16663 referring to Qp Al protein), bacteriophage R17 (SEQ ID NO: 160; PIR Accession<br><br>
(Kastelein, RA. et al, Gene 23:245-254 (1983), Kozlovskaya, TM. et al, DoK Akad. Nauk SSSR 287:452-455 (1986), Adhin, MR. et al.. Virology 170:238-242<br><br>
(1989), Ni, CZ., et al. Protein Set 5:2485-2493 (1996). Priano, C. et al., J. Mol Biol 249:283-297 (1995)). The QP phage capside contains, in addition to the coat    * protein, the so called read-through protein Al and the maturation protein A2. Al is generated by suppression at the UGA stop codon and has a length of 329 aa. The capsid of phage Qp recombinant coat protein used in the invention is devoid of the A2 lysis protein, and contams RNA fix)m the host. The coat protein of RNA phages is an RNA binding protein, and interacts with the stem loop of the ribosomal binding site of the replicase gene acting as a translational repressor during the life cycle of the virus. The sequence and structural elements of the interaction are known (Witherell, GW. &amp; Uhlenbeck, DC. Biochemistry 28:71-76 (1989); lim F. et al., 7. Biol Chem. 271:31839-31845 (1996)). The stem loop and RNA in general ate known to be involved in the virus assembly (Golmohammadi, R. et al,, Structure 4: 543-5554 (1996))<br>
Proteins or protein domains may affect fee stmcture and assembly of the particle even more then a short peptide. As an example, proper folding of antigens comprising disulfide bridges will graerally not be possible in the cytoplasm of E coli. where the QP particles are expressed. Likewise, glycosylation is generally not possible in prokaryotic expression systems. It is therefore an advantage of the contemplated invention described here to attach the antigen to the particle by starting with the already assembled particle and the isolated antigen. This allows expression of both the particle and the antigen in an expression host guaranteeing proper folding of the antigen, and proper folding and assembly of the particle.<br>
It is a finding of this invention, that one or several several antigen molecifles may be attached to one subunit of the capsid of RNA phages coat proteins. A specific feature of the capsid of the coat protein of RNA phages and in particular of Qp capsid is thus the possibility to couple several antigens per subunit This allows for the generation of a dense antigen array. Other viral capsids used for covalent attachment of antigens by way of chemical cross-linking, such for example a HBcAg modified with a lysine residue in its major immunodominant region (MIR; WO 00/32227), show coupling density of maximally 0.5 antigens per subunit. The distance between the spikes (corresponding to the MIR) of HBcAg is 50 A (Wynne, SA. et al, Mol Cell 3: 771-780 (1999)), and therefore an antigen array with distances shorter than 50 A cannot be generated<br><br>
Capsids of Qp coat protein display a defined number of lysine residues on their surface, with a defined topology with three lysine residues pointing towards the interior of the capsid and interacting with the RNA, and four other lysine residues exposed to the exterior of the capsid These defined properties favor the attachment of antigens to the exterior of the particle, and not to the interior where the lysine residues interact with RNA. Capsids of otherRNA phage coat proteins also have a defined number of lysine residues on ther surface and a defined topology of these lysine residues. Another advantage of the capsids derived fix)m RNA phages is their higji expression yield in bacteria, that allows to produce large quantities of material at affordable cost.<br>
Another feature of the capside of Qp coat protein is its stability. QP subumts are bound via disulfide bridges to each other, covalently linking the subunits. QP capsid protein also shows unusual resistance to organic solvents and denaturing agents. Surprisingly, we have observed that DMSO and acetonitrile concentrations as high as 30%, and Guanidinium concentrations as high as 1 M could be used withcxit affecting the stability or the ability to form antigen arrays of the capsid Thus, tbsses organic solvents may be used to couple hydrophobic peptides. The higJi stability of the capsid of QP coat protein is an important feature pertaining to its use for immunization and vaccination of mammals and humans in particular. The resistance of the capsid to organic solvent allows the coupling of antigens not soluble in aqueous buffers.<br>
Insartion of a cysteine residue into the N-terminal p-hairpin of the coat protein of the RNA phage MS-2 has been described in the patent application US/5,698,424. We note however, that the presence of an exposed free cysteine residue in the capsid may lead to oligomerization of capsids by way of disulfide bridge formation-Other attachments contemplated in patent application US/5,698,424 involve the formation of disulfide bridges between the antigen and the Qp particle. Such attachments are labile to sulfhydryl-moiety containing molecules.<br>
The reaction between an initial disulfide bridge formed with a cys-residue on Qp, and the antigen containing a free sulfhydryl residue releases sulfhydryl containing species other than the antigen. These newly formes sulfhydryl containing species can react again with other disulfide bridges present on the particle, thus establishing an equilibrium. Upon reaction with the disulfide bridge formed on the<br><br>
particle, the antigen may either form a disulfide bridge with the cys-residue from the particle, or with the cys-residue of the leaving group molecule which was forming the initial disulfide bridge on the particle. Moreover, the other method of attachment described, using a hetero-bifiinctional cross-linker reacting with a cysteine on the QP particle on one side, and with a lysine residue on the antigen on the other side, leads to a random orientation of the antigens on the particle.<br>
We further note that, in contrast to the capsid of the QP and Fr coat protems, recombinant MS-2 described in patent application US/5,698,424 is essentially free of nucleic acids, while RNA is packaged inside the two capsids mentioned above.<br>
We describe new and inventive compositions allowing the formation of robust antigen arrays with variable antigen density. We show that much higher epitope density can be achieved than usually obtained with other VLPs. We also disclose compositions with simultaneous display of several antigens with appropriate spacing, and compositions wherein the addition of accessory molecules, enhancing solubility or modifiying the capsid in a suitable and desired way.<br>
The preparation of compositions of capsids of KNA phage coat proteins with a high epitope density is disclosed in this application. As a skilled artisan in the Art would know, the conditions for the assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array depend for a good part on the antigen and on the selection of a second attachment site on the antigen. In the case of the absence of a useful second attachmient site, such a second attachment has to be engineered to the antigen.<br>
A prerequisite in designing a second attachment site, is the choice the position at which it should be fused, inserted or generally engineered. A dolled artisan would know how to find guidance in selecting the position of the second attachment site. A crystal structure of the antigen may provide information cm the availability of the C- or N-termini of the molecule (determined for example from their accessibility to solvent), or on the exposure to solvent of residues suitable for use as second attachment sites, such as cysteine residues. Exposed disulfide bridges, as is the case for Fab fragments, may also be a source of a second attachment site, since they can be generally converted to single cysteine residues through mild reduction. In general, in the case where immunization with a self-antigen is aiming at inhibiting the interaction of this self-antigen with its natural ligands, the second attachment site will<br><br>
be added such that it allows generation of antibodies against the site of interaction with the natural ligands. Thus, the location of the second attachment site will selected such, that steric hindrance from the second attachment site or any amino acid linker containing it, is avoided. In further embodiments, an antibody response directed at a site distinct from the interaction site of the self-antigen with its natural ligand is desired. In such embodiments, the second attachment site may be selected such that it prevents generation of antibodies against the int^'action site of the self-antigen with its natural ligands.<br>
Other criteria in selecting the position of the second attachment site include the oligomerization state of the antigen, the site of oligomerization, the presence of a cofactor, and the availability of experimental evidence disclosing sites in the antigen structure and sequence where modification of the antigen is compatible with the function of the self-antigen, or with the generation of antibodies recognizing the self-antigen.<br>
In some embodiments, engineering of a second attachment site onto the antigen requires the fusion of an amino acid linker containing an amino acid suitable as second attachment site according to the disclosures of this invention. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid is cysteine. The. selection of the amino acid linker will be dependent on the nature of the self-antigen, on its biochemical properties, such as pi, charge distribution, glycosylation. In general, flexible amino acid linkers arc favored. Examples of amino acid linkers are the hinge region of Immunoglobulins, glycine serine linkers (GGGGS)n, and glycine linkers (G)n all further containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and optionally further glycine residues. Qn thie following are examples of said amino acid linkers:<br>
N-teiminal gammal: CGDKTHTSPP<br>
C-terminal gamma 1: DKTHTSPPCG<br>
N-terminal gamma 3: CGGPKPSTPPGSSGGAP<br>
C-terminal gamma 3: PKPSTPPGSSGGAPGGCG<br>
N-terminal glycine linker: GCGGGG<br>
C-terminal glycine linker GGGGCG)<br><br>
For peptides, GGCG linkers at the C-terminus of the peptide, or CGG at its N-terminus have shown to be useful. In general, glycine residues will be inserted between bulky amino acids and the cysteine to be used as second attachment site.<br>
A particularly favored method of attachment of antigens to VLPs, and in particular to capsids of RNA phage coat proteins is the linking of a lysine residue on the surface of the capsid of RNA phage coat proteins with a cysteine residue on the antigen. To be effective as second attachment site, a sulfhydryl group must be available for coupling. Thus, a cysteine residue has to be in its reduced state, that is a free cysteine or a cysteine residue with a free sulfhydryl group has to be available. In the instant where the cysteine residue to function as second attachment site is in an oxidized form, for example if it is forming a disulfide bridge, reduction of this disulfide bridge with e.g. DTT, TCEP or P-mercaptoethanol is required.<br>
It is a finding of this application that epitope density on the capsid of RNA phage coat proteins can be modulated by the choice of cross-linker and other reation conditions. For example, the cross-linkers Sulfo-GMBS and SMPH allow reaching higher epitope density than the cross-linker Sulfo-MBS under the same reaction conditions. Derivatization is positively influenced by high concentration of reacstands and manipulation of the reaction conditions can be used to control the number of antigens coupled to RNA phages capsid proteins, and in particular to QP c<br>
From theoretical calculation, the maximally achievable number of globular protein antigens of a size of 17 kDa does not exceed 0.5. Thus, several of the lyane residues of the capsid of QP coat protein will be derivatized with a cross-link«-molecule, yet be devoid of antigen. This leads to the disappearance of a positive chargft, which may be detrimental to the solubility and stability of the conjugate. By replacing some of the lysine residues with arginines, such is the case in the disclosed QP coat protein mutant, we prevent the excessive disappearance of positive charges since the arginine residues do not react with the cross-linker.<br>
In furflier embodiments, we disclose a QP mutant coat protein with additional lysine residues, suitable for obtaining high density arrays of antigens.<br>
Hie crystal  structure of several RNA bacteriophages  has been determined (Grolmohammadi, R. et aU Structure ^:543-554 (1996)). Using such<br><br>
information, one skilled in the art could readily identify surface exposed residues and modify bacteriophage coat proteins such that one or more reactive amino acid residues can be inserted. Thus, one skilled in the art could readily generate and identify modified forms of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used in the practice of the invention. Thus, variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures (e.g., coat proteins of bacteriophage QP, bacteriophage R17, bacteriophage fr, bacteriophage GA, bacteriophage SP, and bacteriophage MS2) can also be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Although the sequence of the variants proteins discussed above will differ from their wild-type counterparts, these variant proteins will generally retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures. Thus, the invention further includes vaccine compositions which contain variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures, as well as methods for preparing such vaccine con^ositions, individual protein subunits used to prepare such vaccine compositions, and nucleic acid molecules which encode these protein subamts. Thus, included within the scope of the invention are variant forms of wild-type proteins which form ordered and repetitive antigen arrays (e.g., variants of protdns which form capsids or capsid-like structures) and retain the ability to associate and form capsids or capsid-like stmctures.<br>
As a result, the invention further includes vaccine compositiOTis conq)rising proteins comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino ^d sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to wild-type proteins which form ordered arrays. Jn many instances, these proteim will be processed to remove signal peptides (e.g., heterologous signal peptides).<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention are nucleic acid molecules which racode proteins used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
In particular embodiments, the invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising proteins comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to any of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 159-167, and forms of these proteins which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove the N-terminal leader sequence.<br>

Specific examples of such truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:l59-167 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids<br><br>
have been removed from the C-terminus. Normally, C-terminal truncation mutants used in the practice of the invention will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.<br>
Further proteins suitable for use in the practice of the present invention also include N-terminal truncation mutants of proteins which fotin capsids or capsid-like structures. Specific examples of such truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs: 159-167 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9,10,12, 14,15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus. Normally, N-terminal truncation mutants used in the practice of the invention will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.<br>
Additional protdns suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include - and C-terminal truncation mutants which form capsides OT capsid-like structures. Suitable truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:159-167 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12,14,15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus airi 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed frran the C-terminus. Normally, N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants used in the practice of the invention will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising protdns comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to die above described truncation mutants.<br>
The invention thus includes vaccine compositions prepared from proteins which form ordered arrays, methods for preparing vaccine compositions from individial protein subunits, methods for preparing these individual protein subunits, nnuleic acid molecules which encode these subunits, and methods for vaccinating andr/or eliciting immunological responses in individuals using vaccine compositions of the invention,<br>
B.       Construction of an Antigen or Antigenic Determinant with a Second Attachment Site<br><br>
The second element in the compositions of the invention is an antigen or antigenic determinant possessing at least one second attachment site capable of association through at least one non-peptide bond to the first attachment site of the non-natural molecular scaffold. The invention provides for compositions that vary according to the antigen or antigenic determinant selected in consideration of the desired therapeutic effect. Other compositions are provided by varying the molecule selected for the second attachment site.<br>
However, when bacterial pili, or pilus-like structures, pilin proteins are used to • prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached to pilin proteins by the expression of piUn/antigen fusion protdns. Similarly, when proteins other than pilin proteins (e.g., viral capsid proteins) are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached to these non-piUn proteins by the expression of non-pilin protein/antigen fusion proteins. Antigens or antigenic determinants may also be attached to bacterial pili, pilus-like structures, pilin proteins, and other proteins whidi form ordered arrays throu^ non-peptide bonds.<br>
Antigens of the invention may be selected from the group consisting d the following: (a) proteins suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (b) proteins suited to induce an inmiune response against infectious diseases; (c) protdns suited to induce an immune response against allergens ,(d) proteins suited to in(bce an immune response in farm animals, and (e) fragments (e.g., a domain) of any G£ tbe proteins set out in (a)-(d).<br>
In one specific embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is one that is useful for the prevention of infectious disease. Sxxh treatment will be useful to treat a wide variety of infectious diseases affecting a wide range of hosts, e.g,, human, cow, sheep, pig, dog, cat, other manomalian species axni non-mammalian species as well. Treatable infectious diseases are well known to those skilled in the art, examples include infections of viral etiology such as HIV, influenza, Herpes, viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles chicken pox, etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosonoiasis, leishmmiasis, trichomoniasis, amoebias'is, etc. Thus, antigens or antigenic determinants selected for the compositions of the invention will be well known to those in the medical art; examples of antigens or antigenic determinants include the following: the HIV antigens gpl40 and gpl60; the influenaza antigens hemagglutinin. Ml protein and neuraminidase. Hepatitis B surface antigen, circumsporozoite protein of malaria.<br>
In specific embodiments, the invention provides vaccine compositions suitable for.use in methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions which are<br><br>
caused OT exacerbated by "self gene products (e.g., tumor necrosis factors). Thus, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate diseases or conditions caused or exacerbated by "self* gene products. Examples of such diseases or conditions include graft versus host disease, IgE-mediated allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, Crohn's disease, allergic asthma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lympoma (NHL), Graves' disease, systemic lupus ary&amp;ematosus (SLE), inflammatory autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis, immunoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy (IPL), angioimmunoproliferative lymphadenopathy (AIL), immunoblastive lymphadenopathy (IBL), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and osteoporosis.<br>
Jn related specific embodiments, compositions of the invention are an inMnunotherapeutic that may be used for the treatment of allergies or cancer.<br>
The selection of antigens or antigenic determinants for the preparation of compositions and for use in methods of treatment for allergies would be known to those skilled in the medical .arts treating such disorders. Representative exan^ks of such antigens or antigenic determinants include the following: bee veocHn phospholipase A2, Bet v I (birch pollen allergen), 5 Dol m V (white-faced hcsosi venom allergen), Mellitin and Der p I (House dust mite allergen), as well as fragmmts of each v^^ch can be used to elicit immunological responses.<br>
As indicated, a preferred antigen or antigenic determinant is Der p I. Der p I is a 25kD protease found in house dust mite faecal particles, Der p I represente the major allergic molecule of house dust mite. Accordingly, 80% of mite altegic patients have anti-Der p I IgE antibodies. In particular, the peptides p52-72 and pll7-133, among others, are known to comprise epitcpes, which are recognized by antibodies specific for the native Der p I IgE antibodies raised in a polyclonal response to the whole antigen bind with highaffinity to the peptide region 59-94 (L.<br>
Pierson-Mullany et al. (2000) Molecular Immunology). Other regions also bind ige<br>
• -      -<br>
with high affinity. The peptide pll7-I33 contains a free cysteine at its N-terminus, preferably representing the second attachment site in accordance with the invention. 3D model assigns peptides p52-72 and pll7-133 to the surface of the whole protean. However, other fragments of the Der p I protein may comprise B cell epitopes being preferably suitable for the present invention.<br>
The selection of antigens or antigenic determinants for compositions and methods of treatment for cancer would be known to those skilled in the medical arts treating such disorders.   Representative examples of such types of antigens or<br><br>
antigenic determinants include the following: HK:2 (breast cancer), GD2 (neuroblastoma), EGF-R (malignant glioblastoma), CEA (medullary thyroid cancer), and CD52 (leukemia), human melanoma protein gplOO, human melanoma protein meIan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, NA17-A nt protein, MAGE-3 protein, p53 protein, HPV16 E7 protein, as well as fragments of each which can be used to elicit immunological responses.Further preferred antigenic determinants useful for compositions and methods of treatment for cancer are molecules and antigenic determinants involved in angiogenesis, Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays an essential role in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as wound healing and solid tumor growth, respectively (Folkman, J. (1995) Nat medicine 1, 27-31; Folkman, J., and Klagsbrun, M. (1987) Science 235, 442-446; Martiny-Baron, 0., and Marmfi, D- (1995) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6,675-680; Risau, W. (1997) Nature 386, 671-674). Rapidly growing tumors initiate and depend on the formation of blood vessels to provide the required blood supply. Thus, antiangiogenic agents might be effective as an anticancer therapy.<br>
Among several putative angiogenic factors that have been identified so far vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent endothelial cell specific mitogen and a primary stimulant of the vascularization of many solid tumors. Although recent findings implicate that a set of angiogenic factors must be perfectly orchestrated to form functional vessels, it seems that the blockade of even a single growth factor might limit disease-induced vascular growth. Thus, blockade of VEGBF may be a premium target for intervention in tumor induced angiogenesis. To target the endothelium rather than the tumor itself has recently emerged as a novel strategy to fight tumors (Millauer B., Shawver, L. K., Plate, K. H., Risau, W., and Ullrich, A. (1994) Nature 367,576-579; Kim, J., Li, B., Winer, J., Aimanini, M., GiUett, N, Phillip, H. S., Ferrara, N. (1993) Nature.362,841-844). In contrast to tumors, which easily mutate target stmctures recognized by the immune systern, endothelial cells do not usually escape the immune system or other therapeutic regimens.<br>
An anti-VEGER-n antibody (MC-lCll) and an anti-VEGF antibody have been disclosed (Lu, D., Kussie, P., Pytowski, B., Persaud, K., Bohlen, P., Witte, L-, Zhu, Z. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,14321-14330; Presta, L.G, Chen, H., O'Connor, SJ., Chisholm, V., Meng, YG., Krummen, L., Winkler, M., Ferrara N. (1997) Cancer Res. 47,4593-4599). The former neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGFR-2 antibody<br><br>
recognizes an epitope that has been identified as putative VEGFAnEGFR-H binding site (Piossek, C, Schneider-Mergener, J., Schimer, M., Vakalopoulou, E., Germeroth, L., Thierauch, K.H. (1999) J Biol Chem. 274,5612-5619).<br>
Thus, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is a peptide derived from the VEGFR-II contact site. This provides a composition and a vaccine composition in accordance with the invention, which may have antiangiogenic properties useful for the treatment of cancer. Inhibition of tumor growth in mice using sera specific for YEGER-2 has been<br><br>
Tumor Necrosis Factor a and amyloid beta peptide (APM2) (SEQ ID NO: 220), as well as fragments of each which can be used to elicit inununological responses. In a<br><br>
preferred embodiment, the antigen is the amyloid beta peptide (A^MZ) (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL VEFAEDVGSNKGAnGLMVGGWIA (SEQ ID NO: 220), or a fragment thereof. The amyloid beta protein is SEQ ID NO: 218. The amyloid beta precursor protein is SEQ ID NO: 219.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is an angiotensin peptide or a fragment thereof. The term "angiotensin peptide" as used herein, shall enconq)ass any peptide comprising the sequence, or fragments thereof, of angiotensinogen, angiotensin I or angiotensin IL The sequraces are as follows: Angiotensinogen: DRVYIHPFHLVIHN; Angiotensin L DRVYIHPEHL; Angiotensin II: DRVYIHPF. Typically, one or more additional amino acids are added either at die C- or at the N-terminus of the angiotensin p^tide sequences. The sequence of the angiotensin peptides corresponds to the human sequence, which is identical to the murine sequence. Therefore, immunization of a human or a mouse with vaccines or compositions, respectively, comprising sirfi angiotensin peptides as antigenic determinant in £u:cordance with the invention, is a vaccination against a self-antigen. Those additional amino acids are, in particular; valuable for an oriented and ordered association to the core particle.<br>
Preferably, the angiotensin peptide has an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) the amino acid sequence of CGGDRVYIHPF; b) the amiim acid sequence of CGGDRVYIHPFHL; c)' the amino acid sequence of DRVYIHPFHLGGC; and d) the amino acid sequence of CDRVYIHPFH. Angiotensin I is cleaved from angiotensinogen (14aa) by the kidney-derived enzyme Renin. Angiotensin I is a biologically inactive peptide of 10 aa. It is further cleaved ^ the N-tenninus by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) into the biologically active 8aa angiotensin H. This peptide binds to the antgiotensin receptors ATII and AT2 which leads to vasoconstriction and aldosterone release.<br>
A vaccine in accordance with the present invention comprising at least cme angiotensin peptide may be used for the treatment of hypertension.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is selected from the group consisting of: (a) a recombinant protein of HIV, (b) a recombinant protein of Mluenza virus (e.g., an Influenza virus M2 protdn or a fragment thereof), (c)a recombinant protein of Hepatitis C virus, (d)a recombinant protein of Toxoplasma, (e) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium falciparum, (f) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium vivox, (g) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium ovale, (h)a recombinant protein of Plasmodium malariae, (i)a recombinant protein of breast cancer cells, (j) a recombinant protein of kidney cancer cells, (k) a recombinant protein of prostate cancer cells, (1) a recombinant protein of<br><br>
skin cancer cells, (m) a recombinant protein of brain cancer cells, (n) a recombmant protein of leukemia cells, (o) a recombinant profiling, (p) a recombinant protein of bee sting allergy, (q) a recombinant proteins of nut allergy, (r) a recombinant proteins of food allergies, (s) recombinant proteins of asthma, (t) a recombinant protein of Chlamydia, and (u) a fragment of any of the protems set out in (aHt).<br>
Once the antigen or antigenic determinant of the composition is chosen, at least one second attachment site may be added to the molecule in preparing to construct the organized and tepetitive airay associated with the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. Knowledge of what will constitute an appropriate second attachment site will be known to those skilled in the art Representative examples of second attachment sites include, but are not limited to, the following: an antigen, an antibody or antibody fragment, biotin, avidin, strepavidin, a receptor, a receptca: ligahd, a ligand, a ligand-binding protein, an interacting leucine zipper polypeptide, an amino group, a chemical group reactive to an amino group; a caxboxyl group, chemical group reactive to a carboxyl group, a sulfliydryl group, a chemical group reactive to a sulfhydryl group, or a combination thereof.<br>
The association between the first and. second attachment sites will be det^mined by the characteristics of the respective molecules selected but win comprise at least one non-peptide bond. Depending upon the combination of first and second attachment sites, the nature of the association may be covalent, ionk:, hydrophobic, polar, or a combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site may be the FOS leucine zipper protein domain or the JUN leucine zipper protein domain.<br>
In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site selected is the FOS leucine zipper protein domain, which associates specifically with the JUN leucine zipper protein domain of the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. The association of the JUN and FOS leucine zipper protein domains provides a basis for the formation of an organized and repetitive antigen or antiganic determinant array on the surface of the scaffold. The FOS leucine zipper protdn domain may be fused in frame to the antigen or antigenic determinant of choice at either the amino terminus, carboxyl terminus or internally located in the protem if desired.<br>
Several FOS fusion constructs are provided for exemplary purposes. Human growth hormone (Example 4), bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (Example 9), ovalbumin (Example 10) and HIV gpl40 (Example 12).<br>
In order to simplify the generation of FOS fusion constructs, several vectors are disclosed that provide options for antigen or antigenic determinant design and construction {see Example 6). The vectors pAV14 were designed for the expression<br><br>
of FOS fusion in E. coli; the vectors pAV5 and pAV6 were designed for the expression of FOS fusion proteins in eukaryotic cells. Properties of these vectors are briefly described:<br>
1.	pAVl: This vector was designed for the secretion of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-terminus into the E, colt periplasmic space. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the StuI/NotI sites of the vector.<br>
2.	pAV2: This vector was designed for the secretion of fusion proteins with FOS at the N-terminus into the E. coli periplasmic space. The gene of interest (g,o.i.) lighted into the Notl/EcoRV (or Notl/ffindm) sites of the vector.<br>
3.	pAV3: This vector was designed for the cytoplasmic production of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-terminus in E. coli. The gene of intraiest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the EcoRV/NotI sites of the vector.<br>
4.	pAV4: This vector is designed for the cytoplasmic production of fusion proteins witti FOS at the N-terminus in E. coli. The gene of interest (g.oi.) may be ligated into the NotFEcoRV (or Notl/Hindlll) sites of the vector. The N-terminal methionine residue is proteolytically removed upon protein synttesis (ffirel et al.. Proa. Natl Acad. Set USA 86:8247-8251 (1989)).<br>
5.	pAV5: This vector was designed for the eukaryotic production of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-terminus. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be inserted between the sequences coding for the hGH signal sequence and the FOS domain by ligation into the Eco47III/NotI sites of the vector. Altematively, a geiK containing its own signal sequence may be fused to the FOS coding region by ligation into the StuI/NotI sites.<br>
6.	pAV6: This vector was designed for the eukaryotic production of fixsion proteins with FOS at the N-terminus. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the NqtFStuI (or Notl/IEndlll) sites of the vector.<br>
As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the construction of a FOS-antigen or -antigenic detenninant fusion protein may include the addition of CCTtain genetic elements to facilitate production of the recombinant protein. Example 4 provides guidance for the addition of certain E. coli regulatory elements fra: translation, and Example 7 provides guidance for the addition of a eukaryotic signd sequence. Other genetic elements may be selected, depending on the specific needs of thepractioner.<br>
The invention is also seen to include the production of the FOS-antigm ot FOS-antigemc determinant fiision protein either in bacterial (Example 5) or eukaryotic cells (Example 8). The choice of which cell type in which to express the fusion protein is within the knowledge of the skilled artisan, depending on factors<br><br>
such as whether post-translational modifications are an important consideration in the design of the composition.<br>
As noted previously, the invention discloses various methods for the constmction of a FOS-mtigcn or FOiS-antigenic detenninant fusion protein through the use of the pAV vectors. In addition to enabling prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression, these vectors allow the practitioner to choose between N- and C-teiminal addition to the antigen of the FOS leucine zipper protein domain. Specific examples are provided wherein N- and C-terminal FOS fusions are made to PLA2 (Example 9) and ovalbumin (Example 10). Example 11 demonstrates the purification of the PLA2 and ovalbumin FOS fusion proteins.<br>
In a more specific embodiment, the invention is drav^ to an antigen or antigenic determinant encoded by the HTV genome. More specifically, the HIV antigen or antigenic detenninant is gpl40. As provided for in Examples 11-15, HIV gpI40 may be created with a FOS leucine zipper protein domain and the fusion protein synthesized and purified for attachment to the non-natural molecular scaffcM of the invention. As one skilled in the art would know, other HTV antigens or antigenic det^minants may be used in the creation of a composition of the invention.<br>
In another more specific embodiment, the invention is dravm to vacdne compositions comprising at least one antigen or antigenic determinant encoded by an Influenza viral nucleic acid, and the use of such vaccine compositions to elicit immune responses. In an even more specific embodiment, the Influenza antigen or antigenic determinant niay be an M2 protein (e.g., an M2 protein having the amino acids shown in SEQ ID NO:213, GenBank Accession No. P06821, or in SEQ ID NO: 212, PIR Accession No. MFIV62, or fragment thereof (e.g., amino acids from about 2 to about 24 in SEQ ID NO:213, die amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:212). Further, influenza antigens or antigenic determinants may be coupled to non-natorai molecular scaffolds or core particles through either peptide or non-peptide bcmds. When Influenza antigens or antigenic determinants are coupled to non-natural molecular scaffolds or core particles through peptide bonds, the molecules whi^ form order and repetitive arrays will generally be prepared as fusion protein expression products. The more preferred embodiment is however a composition, wherein the M2 peptide is coupled by chemical cross-linking, to Qp capsid protdn HBcAg capsid protein or Fill according to the disclosures of the invention.<br>
Portions of an M2 protein (e.g., an M2 protein having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:213), as well as other proteins against which an immunological response is sought, suitable for use with the invention may comprise, or alternatively consist of, peptides of any number of amino acids in length but will generally be at least 6 amino acids in length (e.g., peptides 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 12,15, 18,<br><br>
20, 25, 30, 35. 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 97 amino acids in length).<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site selected is a cysteine residue, which associates specifically with a lysine residue of the non-natural molecular scaffold or core particle of the invention, or the second attachment site selected is a lysine residue, which associates specifically with a cysteine residue of the non-natural molecular scaffold or core particle of the invention. The chemical linkage of the lysine residue (Lys) and cysteine residue (Cys) provides a basis for the formation of an organized and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array on the surface of the scaffold or core particle. The cysteine or lysine residue may be engineered in frame to the antigen or antigenic determinant of choice at either the amino terminus, carboxyl tenninus or internally located in the protein if desired. By way of example, PLAa and HIV gpl40 are provided with a cysteine residue for linkage to a lysine residue first attachment site-In additional specific embodiments, the invention provides vaccine compositions. suitable for use in methods for preventing and/or attenuating allergic reactions, such as allergic reactions which lead to anaphylaxis. Thus, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate allergic reactions. Thus, in certain embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which elicit an immunological response against an allergen. Examples of such allergens include phospholipases such as the phospholipase kz (PLA2) proteins of Apis mellifera (SBQ ID NO: 168, GenBank Accession No. 443189; SEQ ID NO:169, GenBank Accession No. 229378), Apis dorsata (SEQ ID NO: 170, GenBank Accession No. B59055), Apis cerana (SEQ ID N0:171, GenBank Accession No. A59055), Bombus pemsylvanicus (SEQ ID NO: 172 GenBank Accession No. B56338), and Heloderma suspectum (SEQ ID NO:173, GenBank Accession No. P80003; SEQ ID NO:174, GenBank Accession No, S14764; SEQ ID NO: 175, GenBank Accession No. 226711).<br>
Using the amino acid sequence of a PLA2 protein of Apis mellifera (SEQ ID NO: 168) for illustrationrpeptides of at least about 60 amino acids in length, which represent any portion of the whole PLA2 sequence, may also be used in compositions for preventing and/or attenuating allergic reactions. Examples of such peptides include peptides which comprise amino acids 1-60 in SEQ ID NO: 168, amino acids 1-70 m SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 10-70 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 20-80 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 30-90 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 40-100 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 47-99 in SEQ ID NO:l68, amino acids 50-110 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 60-120 in SEQ ID N0:168, amino acids 70-130 in SEQ ID NO:168, or amino acids 90-134 in SEQ ID N0:168, as well corresponding portions of<br><br>
other PLA2 proteins (e.g., PLA2 proteins described above). Further examples of such peptides include peptides which comprise amino acids 1-10 in SEQ ID NO: 168, amino acids. 5-15 in SEQ K) NO:168, amino acids 10-20 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 20-30 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 30-40 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 40-50 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 50-60 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 60-70 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 70-80 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 80-90 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 90-100 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 100-110 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 110-120 in SEQ E) NO:168, or amino acids 120-130 in SEQ ID NO: 168, as well corresponding portions of other PLA2 proteins {e.g., PIA2 proteins described above).<br>
Portions of PLA2, as well as portions of other proteins against which an inununological response is sought, suitable for use with the invention may comprise, or alternatively consist of, peptides which are generally at least 6 amino acids in length (e.g., peptides 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,75, 80,85,90,95. or 100 amino acids in length).<br>
PIA2 peptides {e.g., the full length PLA2 proteins discussed above, as well as subportions of each) may also be coupled to any substance (e.g., a QP capsid protein or fragment thereof) which allows for the formation of ordered and repetitive antigen arrays.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the invention provides compositions being particularly suitable for treating and/or preventing conditions caused or exacerbated by "self' gene products.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is RANKL (Receptor activator of NFkB Ligand). RANKL is also known as TRANCE (TNF-related activation induced cytokine), ODF (Osteoclast differentiation factor) or OPGL (Osteoprotegerin ligand). The amino acid sequence of the extracellular part of human RANKL is shown in SEQ ID No: 221 (RANKL_human: TrEMBL:Ol4788), while the amino acid sequence of a human isoform is shown in SEQ ID No: 222. . Sequences for the extracellular part of murine RANKL and an isoform are shown in SEQ ID No.223 (RANKL_mouse: TrEMBL:035235), and in SEQ ID No.224 (RANKL_mouse splice forms: TrEMBL:Q9JJK8 and TrEMBL:Q9JJK9), respectively.<br>
It has been shown that RANKL is an essential factor in osteoclastogenesis. Inhibition of the interaction of RANKL with its receptor RANK can lead to a suppression of osteoclastogenesis and thus provide a means to stop excessive bone resorption as seen in osteoporosis and other conditions. The RANKL/RANK interaction was inhibited either by a RANK-Fc fusion protein or the soluble decoy receptor of RANKL, termed osteoprotegerin OPG.<br><br>
In the immune system RANKL is expressed on T cells while RANK is found on antigen-presenting cells. The RANKL-RANK interaction was shown to be critical for CD40L-independent T-helper cell activation (Bachmann et al, J, Exp. Med. 7: 1025 (1999)) and enhance the longevity and adjuvant properties of dendritic cells (Josien et al., / Exp Med. 191:495 (2000)).<br>
In bone RANKL is expressed on stromal cells or osteoblasts, while RANK is expressed on the osteoclast precursor. The interaction of RANK and RANKL is crucial for the development of osteoclast precursors to mature osteoclasts. The interaction can be blocked by osteoprotegerin.<br>
OPG-deficient mice develop osteoporosis that can be rescued by injection of recombinant OPG. This means that OPG is able to reverse osteoporosis. Thus, inhibition of the RANK-RANKL ihteraction by way of injecting this specific embodiment of the invention may reverse osteoporosis.<br>
In addition, arterial calcification was observed in OPG k.o. mice which could be reversed by injection of OPG (Min et al, J. Exp. Med. 4: 463 (2000)). In an adjuvant-induced arthritis model OPG injection was able to prevent bone loss and cartilage destruction, but not inflammation (paw swelling). It is assumed that activated T cells lead to a RANKL-mediated increase of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. OPG inhibits prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis and prevents prostate tumor growth in the bone of mice. OPG diminishes advanced bone cancer pain in mice.<br>
RANKL is a transmembrane protein of 245 aa belonging to the TNF-superfamily. Part of the extracellular region (178 aa) can be shed by a TACE-like protease (Lum et al., J Biol Chem. 274:13613 (1999)). In addition splice variants lacking, the transmembrane domain have been described (Ikeda et al., Endocrinology 142: 1419 (2001)). The shed part contains the domain highly homologous to soluble TNF-a This extracellular domain of RANKL forms homotrimers as seen for TNF-a The C-teiminus seems to be involved in the trimer contact site. One cysteine is present in this region of the sequence.<br>
We have built a model for the 3-dimensional structure of the corresponding region of RANKL and found that the naturally present cysteine may not be accessible in the folded structure for interaction with a first attachment site on the carrier in accordance with the present invention. The N-terminus is preferred for attaching a second attachment site comprising an amino acid linker with an additional cysteine residue. A human-RANKL construct with an N terminal amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue fused to the extracellular part of RANKL is a very preferred embodiment of the invention. However, an amino-acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-terminus of the RANKL<br><br>
sequence or the extracellular part of RANKL leads to further preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
Human-RANKL constructs, such as the one identified in SEQ ID NO:320, are generated according to the teachings disclosed in EXAMPLE 6, and the man skilled in the art are able to compare murine and human RANKL sequences in a protein sequence alignment to identify the part of the sequence of human-RANKL to be cloned in the vectors described in EXAMPLE 6. Fragments containing amino adds 138-317 and corresponding to the C-terminal region of the extracellular domain of human RANKL, are particularly favored embodiments of the invention, and can be modified for coupling to VLPs and Pili as required according to the teaching of the present invention. Howeever other suitable vectors may also be used for expression in the suitable host described below. Further human-RANKL constructs, and in particular, the ones comprising the part of the extracellular region (178 aa), - or fragments th^eof - that can be shed by a TACE-like protease (Lum et al, J Biol Chem. 274:13613 (1999)), or comprising the sequence corresponding to the alternative splice variants lacking the transmembrane domain, as well as conservative fragm^its thereof, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Human C-terminal fragments comprising amino acids 165-317 are also embodiments of the invention. Alternatively, fragments which encompass the entire extracellular region (amino acids 71-317) and can be modified for coupling to VLPs and Pili as required according to the teaching of the present invention, are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
RANKL has been expressed in different systems (E.coli, insect cells, manomalian cells) and shown to be active, and therefore several expression systems can be used for production of the antigen of the composition. In the case where expression of the protein is directed to the periplasm of E. coli, the signal peptide of RANKL, or of RANKL constmcts consisting of the extracellular part of the protein, and Jboth possibly modified to comprise a second attachment site in accordance with the invention, is replaced with a bacterial signal peptide. For expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of K coli, RANKL constructs are devoid of signal peptide.<br>
ii another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is MIF or a fragment thereof. MEF is a cytokine that has been first described in 1966 by its function as an inhibitor of macrophage migration. It is also known as delayed early response protein 6 (DER6), glycosylation inhibiting factor or phenylpyruvate tautomerase. The latter name originates from enzymatic activity of MDP, however the endogenous substrate has not been identified.<br><br>
MIF has been shown to be implicated in a wide range of conditions. MIF (mRNA and protein) is upregulated in delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction induced by tuberculin, and anti-MIF antibody inhibits this DTH reaction. MIF is also upregulated in renal allograft rejection. In a model for ocular autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAXJ), anti-MIF treatment caused delay of EAU development. In patients, there is an increase in serum of MIF, which is also the case in Behcet's disease patients and patients suffering from iridocyclitis. Inmiunization against MIF may provide a way of treatment against rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
High serum MIF concentration has been found in atopic dermatitis patients. In skin lesions, MIF is diffusely expressed instead of being found in the basal cell layer in controls. MIF concentration is decreasing after steroid treatment, consistent with a role of MIF in inflammation. MIF has also been found to contribute to the establishment of glomerulonephritis. Animals treated with anti-MIF Antibody show significantiy reduced glomerulonephritis. MIF is pituitary derived, secreted e.g. upon LPS stimulation, and potentiates endotoxemia. Accordingly, anti-MIF mAb inhibits endotoxemia and septic shock, while recombinant MEF markedly increases lethality of peritonitis. MIF is also a glucocorticoid-induced modulator of cytokine production, and promotes inflammation.<br>
MIF is produced by T-cells (Th2), supports proliferation of T-cells, and anti-MIF-treatment reduces T-cell proliferation and IgG levels. ITiere is an increased MEF concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis and neuro-Behcet's disease patients. High MIF levels were also found in sera of patients with extended psoriasis- High MIF levels are found in sera of ulcerative colitis patients but not Crohn's disease patients.<br>
High MIF levels have been found in sera of patients with bronchic asthma. MIF is also upregulated in synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Anti-MIF treatment was effectivly decreasing rheumatoid arthritis in mouse and rat models (Mikulowska et aU /. Immunol i5S:5514-7(1997); Leech et cd.. Arthritis Rheunu 41:910-1 (1998), Leech et al. Arthritis Rheum. 43:827-33 (2000), Santos et al, Clin, Exp. Immunol 123:309-14 (2001)). Thus, treatment directed at inhibiting MIF    ~ activity using a composition comprising MIF as an antigenic determinant may be beneficial for the conditions mentioned above.<br><br>
MIF from mouse, rat and human consists of 114 amino acid and contains three conserved cysteines, as shown in SEQ ID No 225 (MIF.rat: SwissProt), in SEQ ID No 226 (MIF.mouse: SwissProt) and in SEQ ID No 227 (MIF_human: SwissProt). Three subunits form a homotrimer that is not stabilized by disulfide bonds. The X-ray structure has been solved and shows three free cysteines (Sun et al, PNAS 93: 5191-96 (1996)), while some literature data claim the presence of a disulfide bond. Nonetheless, none of the cysteines are exposed enough for optimal interaction with a possible first attachment site present on the carrier. Thus, as the C-terminus of the protein is exposed in the trimer structure, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue is, preferably, added at the C-terminus of the protein, for generation of the second attachment site in this preferred embodiment of the invention, as exemplarily described in EXAMPLE 4 for rat-MIF.<br>
There is only one amino acid change between mouse- and rat-MIF, and similarly a very high sequence homology (about 90 % sequence identity) between human- and rat-MBF or human- and mouse-MIF. Human- and mouse-MIF constructs according to the invention are described and can be generated as disclosed in EXAMPLE 4. In order to demonstrate the high potency to induce a self-specific immune response of MIF protein, or fragments thereof, associated to a core particle in accordance with the present invention, rat-MDF constructs coupled to Qp capsid protein were injected in mice. The high antibody titers obtained by immunizing mice with rat-MIF show that tolerance towards immunization with self-antigens was overcome by immunizing with MDF constructs coupled to viras-like particles, and in particular to Qp capsid protein (EXAMPLE 4). Therefore, compositions in accordance with the present invention comprising human-MIF protein associated to a core particle, preferably to pili or a virus-like particle, and more preferably to a viruslike particle of a RNA-phage, and even more preferably to RNA-phage QP or fr, represent very preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
However, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine that is added at the N-terminus of the sequence of MIF leads to further preferred embodiments of the present invention. MIF has been expressed in E.coli, purified and shown to be fully<br>
functiional (Bemhagen et al, Biochemistry 33: 14144-155 (1994). Thus, MIF may be,<br>
*<br>
preferably, expressed in E. coli for generating the preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
Tautomerase activity of MIF is inhibited, if the start methionine is not cleaved from the construct. MIF constructs expressed in Kcoli and described in EXAMPLE 4 show tautomerase activity. Mutants of MIF where the start methionine is cleaved and where the proline residue right after the start methionine in the sequence is mutated to alanine also do not show tautomerase activity represent further embodiments of the invention and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention. In some specific embodiments, immunization with MIF mutants devoid of tautomerase activity is envisaged.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Interleukin-17 (IL-17). Human IL-17 is a 32-kDa, disulfide-linked, homodimeric protein with variable glycosylation (Yao, Z. et at, J. Immunol 155: 5483-5486 (1995); Fossiez, R et aU /. Exp. Med 183: 2593-2603 (1996)). The protein comprises 155 amino acids and includes an N-terminal secretion signal sequence of 19-23 residues. The amino acid sequence of IL-17 is similar only to a Herpesvirus protein (HSV13) and is not similar to other cytokines or known proteins. The amino acid sequence of human IL-17 is shown in SEQ ID No: 228 (ACCESSION #: AAC50341), The mouse protein sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 229 (ACCESSION #: AAA37490). Of the large number of tissues and cell lines evaluated, the mRNA transcript encoding IL-17 has been detected only in activated T cells and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Yao, Z. et al:, J. Immunol 155: 5483-5486 (1995); Fossiez, F. et al, J. Exp. Med 183: 2593-2603 (1996)). Both human and mouse sequences contain 6 cysteine residues.<br>
The receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed in many tissues and cell, types (Yao, Z. et al, Cytokine 9: 794-800 (1997)). Although the amino acid sequence of the human IL-17 receptor (866 aa) predicts a protein with a single trans-membrane domain and a long, 525 aa intracellular domain, the receptor sequence is unique and is not similar to that of any of the receptors from the cytdcine/growth factor receptor family. This coupled with the lack of similarity of IL-17 itself to other known proteins indicates that IL-17 and its receptor may be part of a novel family of signalling protein and receptors. Clinical studies indicate IL-17 may be involved in many inflanmiatory diseases. IL-17 is secreted by synovial T cells from rheumatoid airthritis patients and stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators (Chabaud, M. et al., J. Immunol 161: 409-414 (1998); Chabaud, M. et al., Arthritis Rlieum. 42: 963-970 (1999)). High levels of IL-17 have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ^olkowska M. et a/., J Immunol 164:2B32-S (2000)).<br><br>
Literleukin 17 has been shown to have an effect on proteoglycan degradation in murine knee joints pudler J. et al, Ann Rheum Dis. 59: 529-32 (2000)) and contribute to destruction of the synovium matrix (Chabaud M. et cd., CytoUne, i2:1092-9 (2000)). There are relevant arthritis models in animals for testing the effect of an immunization against MIF (Chabaud M, et aU CytoJdne. 12:1092-9 (2000)). Elevated levels of IL-17 mRNA have been found in mononuclear cells from patients with multiple sclerosis (Matusevicius, D. et al., Mult Scler. 5: 101-104 (1999)). Elevated serum levels of IL-17 are observed in patients suffering Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Wong C.K. et al., Lupus 9: 589-93 (2000)). In addition, IL-17 mRNA levels are increased in T cells isolated from lesional psoriatic skin (Teunissen, M. B. etal., J. Invest. Dermatol III: 645-649 (1998)).<br>
The involvement of IL-17 in rejection of kidney graft has also been demonstrated (Fossiez F. et al. Int. Rev. Immunol 16:541-51 (1998)). Evidence for a role of IL-17 in organ allograft rejection has also been presented by Antonysamy et al. (J. Immunol i62:577-84 (1999)) who showed IL-17 promotes the functional differentiation of dendritic cell progenitors. Their findings suggest a role for IL-17 in allogeneic T cell proliferation that may be mediated in part via a maturation-inducing effect on DCs. Furthermore the same group reports (Tang J.L. et al., Transplantation 72:348-50 ( 2001)) a role for IL-17 in the immunopathogenesis of acute vascular rejection where Interleukin-17 antagonism inhibits acute but not chronic vascular rejection. IL-17 appears to have potential as a hovel target for therapeutic intervention in allograft rejection.<br>
The above findings suggest IL-17 may play a pivotal role in the initiation or maintenance of an inflammatory response (Jovanovic, D. V. et al., J. Immunol 160: 3513-3521 (1998)).<br>
The anti-IL"17 monoclonal antibody mAb5 (Schering-Plough Research Institute) was able to completely inhibit the production of IL-6 fix&gt;m rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium supematants following induction by 50 ng/ml of IL-17. An irrelevant mAb MXl had no effect in this assay. mAb5 is a mouse IgGl obtained after immunization with human rIL-17 (r = recombinant). A concentration of 1 jig/ml of mAb5 .was able to completely inhibit the IL-6 production in the assay system (Chabaud, M. et al., /. Immunol 161: 409-414 (1998)). Thus, immunization against IL-17 provides a way of treatment for the various conditions described above.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, thus, the composition comprises a linker containing a second attachment site and being fused to the C-terminus of recombinant IL-17. In further preferred embodiments of the invention, however, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the<br><br>
signal peptide. For eukaryotic expression systems, the signal peptide of the IL-17 gene, as it is the case for the other self-antigens indicated herein, may be replaced by another signal peptide if required. For expression in bacteria, the signal peptide is either replaced by a bacterial signal peptide for soluble expression in the periplasm, or deleted for expression in the cytoplasm. Constructs of human IL-17 devoid of signal peptide will preferably comprise residues 24-155, 22-155, 21-155 or 20-155. Constructs of mouse IH7 devoid of signal peptide will preferably comprise residues 26-158, 25-158, 24-158 or 27-155. Human IL-17 may be expressed in CVl/EBNA cells; recombinant hIL-17 has been shown to be secreted in both glycosylated and noiiglycosylated forms (Yao, Z. et al,, 7. Immunol 155: 5483-5486 (1995)). IL-17 can also be expressed as hIL-17/Fc fusion protein, with subsequent cleavage of the IL-17 protein from the fusion protein. IH7 may also be expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris (Murphy K,P. et. al.. Protein ExprPunf. 12: 208-14 (1998)), Human IL17 may also be expressed in E. coli. When expression of IL-17 in E. coli is directed to the periplasm, the signal peptide of IL-17 is replaced by a bacterial signal peptide. For expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of E. coli, ILrl7 constructs are devoid of signal peptide.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the antigenic determinant is Interleukin-13 (IL-13). IL-13 is a cytokine that is secreted by activated T lymphocytes and primarily impacts monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. The amino acid sequence of precursor human IH3 is shown in SEQ ID No: 230 and the amino acid sequence of processed human IL-13 is shown in SEQ ID No: 231. The first 20 amino acids of the precursor protein correspond to the signal peptide, and are absent of the processed protein. The mouse sequence has also been described, and the processed amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 232 (Brown K.D. et al, 7, Immunol 142:619-6S1 (1989)). Dependmg on the expression host, the IL-13 construct will comprise the sequence of the precursor protein, e.g. for expression and secretion in eukaryotic hosts, or consist of the mature protein, e.g. for cytoplasmic expression in E.coli. For expression in the periplasm of E, coli, the signal peptide of IH3 is replaced by a bacterial signal peptide.    -^<br>
IL-13 is a T helper 2-derived cytokine (like IL-4, IL-5) that has recently been implicated in allergic airway responses (asthma). Upregulation of IL-13 and IL-13 receptor has been found in many tumour types (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma). Interleukin 13 is secreted by and stimulates the growth of Hodgkin and Reed-Stemberg cells (Kapp U et al, J Eyp Med. iS9:1939-46 (1999)). Thus, immunization against IL.13 provides a way of treating among others the conditions described above, such as Asthma or Hodgkins Lymphoma.<br><br>
Preferably, the composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue and being fused to the N or C-tenninUs of the sequence of mature IL-13 to introduce a second attachment site within the protein. In further preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is added to the N-terminus of the mature form of IL-13, since it is freely accessible according to the NMR structure of IL-13 Psenmesser. E. Z. et aU JMolBiol 310: 231 (2001)). In again further preferred embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-tenninus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-tenninus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. In still further preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue is added to the C-terminus of the protein.<br>
IL-13 may be expressed in E.coli (Eisenmesser E.Z. et al.. Protein Expr, Purifi 20:186-95 (2000)), or in NS-0 cells (eukaryotic cell line) (Cannon-Carlson S. et al.. Protein Expr. PurifJ2:239-4i (199S)). EXAMPLE 9 describes constructs and expression of constructs of murine IL-13, fused to an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue, in bacterial and eukaryotic hostsJHuman IL-13 constructs can be generated according to the teachings of EXAMPLE 9 and yielding the proteins human C-IH3-F (SEQ ID NO:330) and human C-IH3-S (SEQ ID NO:331) after expression of the fusion proteins and cleavage with Factor Xa, and enterokinase respectively. The so generated proteins can be coupled to VLPs and Pili, leading to preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-5 is a lineage-specific cytokine for eosinophilopoiesis and plays an important part in diseases associated with increased number of eosinophils, such as asthma. The sequence of precursor and processed human IL-5 is provided in SEQ ID No: 233 and in SEQ ID No: 234, respectively, and the processed mouse amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ E) No: 235.<br>
The biological function of IL-5 has been shown in several studies (Cofftnan R.L. et dl, Science 245: 308-10 (1989);T!:opf ef a/., Inwmnity 4:15-24 (1996)), which point to a beneficial effect of inhibiting IL-5 function in diseases mediated through eosinophils. Inhibition of the action of IL-5 provides thus a way of treatment against asthnaa and other diseases associated with eosinophils.<br>
IL-5 forms a dimer, covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. A single chain (sc) construct has been reported wherein two monomers of IL-5 are linked by a peptide linker.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, a peptide linker containing a free cysteine is added at the N-terminus of the sequence of the processed form of IL-5.<br><br>
Addition of a linker containing a free cysteine is also, preferably, envisaged at the N-terminus of the sequence of the processed form of a sctt^S. In further preferred embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-tenoinus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br>
In again further preferred embodiments, a linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the C- terminus of the sequence of IL-5, or to the C-terminus of a scIL-S sequence.<br>
A number of expression systems have been described for IL-5 and can be used in preparing the compositions of the invention, A bacterial expression system using E.coli has been described by Proudfoot et al., (Biochem J, 270:357-61 (1990)). In the case where IL-5 is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli, the IL-5 construct is devoid of a signal peptide. Insect cells may also be used for producing IL-5 constructs for making the compositions of the invention (Pierrot C. et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 253:756-60 (1998)). Likewise, Baculovirus expression systems (sf9 cells; Ingley E. et al, Eur. J, Biochem. 795:623-9 (1991) and Brown P.M. et aU Protein Expr. Purif. 6: 63-71 (1995)) can also be used. Finally, mamoaialian expression systems have also been reported (CHO cells) and can be used in preparing these compositions of the invention (Kodama S et al., J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 110:693-701 (1991)),<br>
Baculovirus expression systems (Mitchell et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2i:332S (1993); Kunimoto DY et al. Cytokine 3:224-30 (1991)) and a mammalian cell expression system using CHO cells (Kodama S et al,, Glycobiology 2:419-27 (1992)) have also been described for mouse IL-5.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 describes the expression of murine IL-5 constructs wherein the IL-5 sequence is fused at its N-terminus to amino acid linkers containing a cysteine residue for coupling to VLPs and Pili. Human constructs can be generated'according to the teaching of EXAMPLE 10 and yield the proteins .human C-IL-5-E (SEQ ID" NO:335), human C-IL-5-F (SEQ ID NO:336) and human C-IL-5-S: (SEQ ID NO:337) suitable for coupling to VLPs and Pili and leading to preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is CCL-2L CCL-21 is a chemokine of the CC subfamily that is also knovm as small inducable cytokine A21, as exodus-2, as SLD (secondary lymphocyte cytokine), as TCA4 (thymus-derived chemotactic agent 4) or 6Ckine.<br><br>
CCL21 inhibitis hemopoiesis and stimulates chemotaxis for thymocytes, activated T-cells and dendritic cells, but not for B cells, macrophages or neutrophiles. It shows preferential activitiy towards naive T cells. It is also a potent mesangial cell chemoattractant. CCL21 binds to chemokine receptors CCR7 and to CXCR3 (dependent on species). It can trigger rapid integrin-dependent arrest of lymphocytes rolling under physiological shear and is highly expressed by high endothelial venules.<br>
Murine CCL21 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in a human lung cancer SCBD mouse model (Anenberg et at, Cancer Immunol Immunothen 49: 587-92 (2001)) and a colon carcinoma tumor model in mice (Vicari et al., J. Immunol 165:1992-2000 (2001)). The angiostatic activity of murine CCL21 was also detected in a rat corneal micropocket assay (Soto et al, Proc, Natl Acad Set U SA95: 8205-10 (1998),<br>
It has been shown that chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 are upregulated in breast cancer cells and that CCL21 and CXCL12, the respective ligands, are highly expressed in organs representing the first destinations of breast cancer metastasis Mtfller et al. (Nature 410: 50-6 (2001)), In vitro CCL21-mediated chemotaxis could be blocked by neutralizing anti-CCL21 antibodies as was CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis by the respective antibodies. Thus, immunization against CCL21 provides a way of treatment against metastatis spread in cancers, more specifically in breast cancer.<br>
Secreted CCL21 consist of 110 or 111 aa in nwce and humans, respectively. The respective sequences are shown in SEQ ID No: 236 (Swissprot: SY21_human) and in SEQ ID No: 237 (Swissprot: SY21_mouse). In contrast to other CC cytokines does CCL21 contain two more cysteines within an extended region at the C-terminus. It is assumed that all cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds.<br>
In the following, constructs and expression systems are described for making compositions of the invention comprising the CaL21 antigenic determinant b the NMR structure of the homologous protein eotaxin, both N- and C-terminus are exposed to the solvent. In some specific embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue as a second attachment site is added at the C-terminus of the protein. A fusion protein with alkaline phosphatase (at the C-terminus of CCL21) has been expressed and was shown to be functional, showing that fusions at the C-terminus of CCL21 are compatible with receptor binding. In other specific embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br><br>
Several expression systems have been described for production of CCL21 (e.g. Hedrick et al, J Immunol 159:1589-93 (1997)) For example, it may expressed in a baculovirus system (Nagira et al., /. Biol Chem, 272:19518-24 (1997)).<br>
In a related preferred embodiment, the antigenic determinant is Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), now termed CX(X12. CXCL12 is a chemokine produced by bone marrow stromal cells and was originally identified as a stimulatory factor for pre-B cells.<br>
As already stated above, it has been shown that chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 are upregulated in breast cancer cells and that CCL21 and SDF-1, the respective ligands, are highly expressed in organs representing the first destinations of breast cancer metastasis Mailer et al. (Nature 410: 50-6 (2001)). In vitro SDF-1 / CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis could be inhibitied by neutralizing anti-SDF-1 and anti-CXCR4 antibodies.<br>
In a breast cancer metastasis model in SCID mice using the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, a significant decrease in lung metastasis was observed when mice were treated with anti-CXCR4 antibodies. In the draining lymph nodes a reduction of metastasis to the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes (38% instead of 100% metastasis in controls) was observed. Thus, immunization against CXCL12 provides a way of treatment against metastatis of cancers, more specifically of breast cancers.<br>
The SDF-1 / CXC314 chemokine-receptor pair has been shown to increase the efficacy of homing of more primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells to be bone marrow. In addition, CXCR4 and SDF-1 are supposed to influence the distribution of chFonic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These cells invariably infiltrate the bone marrow of patients and it was shown that their migration in the bone marrow was CXCR4 depend^it. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells undergo apoptosis unless they are cocultuied with stromal cells. SDF-1 blocking antibodies could inhibit this protective effect of stromal cells (Burger et al. Blood 96: 2655-63 (2000)). Immunizing against CXCL12 thus provides a way of treatment against chronic lymphocytic leukemia.<br>
CXCR4 has been shown to be a coreceptor for entiy of HIV into T-cells. SDF-1 inhibits infection of CD4+ cells by X4 (CXCR4-dependent) HIV strains (Oberlin et al.. Nature 382:833-5 (1996); Bleul et oZ., Nature 382:829-33 (1996), Rusconi et al,, Antivir. Then 5:199-204 (2000)). Synthetic peptide analogs of SDF-1 have been shown to effectively inhibit HIV-1 entry and infection via the CXCR4 receptor(WO059928Al). Thus, immunization against CXCL12 provides a way to block HTV entry in T-cells, and therefore a way of treating AIDS.<br>
SDF-1-CXCR4 interactions were also reported to play a central role in CD4+ T cell accumulation in rheumatoid arthritis synovium (Nanki et al., 2000).<br><br>
Immunization against SDF-1 thus provides a way of treatment against rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Human and murine SDF-1 are known to arise in two forms, SDF-la and SDF-ip, by differential splicing from a single gene. They differ in four C-terminal amino acids that are present in SDF-1 P (74 aa) and absent in SDF-1 a (70 aa). The sequence of human is shown in SEQ ID No: 238 (Swissprot: SDFl^human) and the sequence mouse SDF-1 is shown in SEQ ID No: 239 (Swissprot: SDFl_mouse). SDF-1 contains four conserved cysteines that form two intra-molecular disulfide bonds. The crystal structure of SDF shows a non covalentily-linked dimer (Dealwis et a/., PN^ 95: 6941-46 (1998)). The SDF-1 structure also shows a long N-terminal extension.<br>
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify (part of) the receptor-binding site on SDF-1 (Ohnishi et al, I Interferon CytoMne Res, 20:691-700 (2000)) and Elisseeva et cd. (J. Biol Ghent 275:26799-805 (2000)) and Heveker et al. (Curr. Biol 8:369-76 (1998)) described SDF-1 derived peptides inhibiting receptor binding (and HTV entry).<br>
In the following, constructs and expression systems suitable in the generation of the compositions of the invention related to SDF-1 are described. The N- and C-tenninus of SDF-1 are exposed to the solvent In specific embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a cysteine as second attachment site is tiius fused to the C-tenninus of the protein sequence, while in other specific embodiments an amino acid linker containing a cysteine as second attachment site is fused to the N-tenninus of the protein sequence. The amino acid linker containing a fi:ee cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.The genes coding for these specific constructs may be cloned in a suitable expression vector.<br>
Expression of SDF-1 in a sendai virus system in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (Moriya et al,, FEBS LeU. 425:105-11 (1998)) has been described as well as expression in E,coli (Hobnes et al, Prot Expr. Purif, 21: 361-n (2001)) and chemical synthesis of SDF-1 (Dealwis et al, PNAS 95: 6941-46 (2001)).<br>
In yet another embodhnent of the invention, the antigenic determinant is BLC. B-lyinphocyte chemoattractant (BLC, CXCL13) is expressed in the spleen, Peyer's patches and lymph nodes (Gunn et al., 1998). Its expression is strongest in the germinal centres, where B cells undergo somatic mutation and affinity maturation. It belongs to the CXC chemokine family, and its closest homolog is GROa_(Gunn et al, Nature 39i:799-803 (1998)). Human BLC is 64% homologous to murine BLC. Its receptor is CXCR5. BLC also shares homology with IL-8. BLC recruits B-cells to follicles in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and peyer's patches. BLC is<br><br>
also required for recruitment of B-cells to compartment of the lymph nodes rich in follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) (Ansel et al, Nature -^05:309-314 (2000)). BLC also induces increased expression of Lymphotoxinaip2 (LT?aip2) on the recruited B-cells. This provides a positive feed-back loop, since LT?aip2 promotes BLC expression (Ansel et a/., Nature 406:309-314 (2000)). BLC has also been shown to be able to induce lymphoid neogenesis (Luther et aU Immunity 72:471-481(2000)). It appears that FDCs also express BLC. Thus inmiunization against BLC may provide a way of treatment against autoinnmune diseases where lymphoid neogenesis is involved, such as Rheumatoid synovitis and Rheumatoid arthritis or Type I diabetes, A construct of BLC bearing a C-terminal his-tag has been described, and is functional (Ansel. K.M. et at,, I Exp. Med. 190:1123-1134 (1999)).<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises a linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-terminus of the BLC sequence.<br>
In IL-8, which is homologous to BLC, both N- and C-teraiini are free. In a further preferred embodiment, addition of an anaino acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site is, therefore, done to the N-terminus of BLC for generation of this specific composition of the invention.<br>
In further preferred embodiments of the present invention, the composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine and being fused to the N-tenninus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N^terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-tMininally of the signal peptide. The genes coding for these specific constructs may be cloned in a suitable expression vector and expressed accordingly. The sequence of human BLC is shown in SEQ ID No: 240 (Accession: NP_006410). Amino acids 1-22 of the sequence are the signal peptide. The mouse sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 241 (Accession NPJ)61354). Amino acids 1-21 are the signal peptide. Compositions of the invention with BLC as the antigenic determinant, preferably, use the mature form of the protein for generating the compositions of the invention.'<br>
In another specific embodiment, the antigenic determinant is Eotaxin. Eotaxin is a chemokine specific for Chemokine receptor 3, present on eosinophils, basophils and Th2 cells. Eotaxin seems however to be highly specific for Eosinophils (Zimmerman et al, J, Immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). Eosinophil migration is reduced by 70% in the eotaxin-1 knock-out mouse, which however can still develop eosinophilia (Rothenberg et al, J, Exp. Med. 185: 785-90 (1997)). IL-5 seems to be responsible for the migration of eosinophils from bone-marrow to blood, and eotaxin for the local migration in the tissue (Humbles et a/., J. Exp. Med. 186: 601-12 (1997)).<br><br>
The human genome contains j eotaxm genes, eoiaxmple. mey snare oO% homology to each other. Two genes are known so far in the mouse: eotaxin 1 and eotaxin 2 (Zimmerman et al /. Immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). They share 38% homology. Murine eotaxin-2 shares 59% homology with human eotaxin-2. In the mouse, eotaxin-1 seems to be ubiquitously expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract, while eotaxin-2 seems to be predominantly expressed in the jejunum (Zimmerman et aU J. Immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). Eotaxin-1 is present in broncho-alveolar fluid (Teixeira et al, J. Clin. Invest. 100: 1657-66 (1997)). The sequence of human eotaxin-1 is shown in SEQ Id No.: 242 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of human eotaxin-2 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 243 (aa 1-26 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of human eotaxin-3 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 244 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of mouse eotaxin-1 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 245 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), and the sequence of mouse eotaxin-2 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 246 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide).<br>
Eotaxin has a MW of 8,3 kDa. It is in equilibrium between monomers and<br>
dimers over a wide range of conditions, with an estimated Kd of 1.3 mM at 37°C<br>
(Crump et al., J. Biol Chem. 273: 22471-9 (1998)). The monomer form is however<br>
predominant The structure of Eotaxin has been elucidated by NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Binding site to its receptor CCR3 is at the N-terminus, and the region preceding the<br>
first cysteine is crucial (Crump et cd., J. Biol Chem. 273: 22471-9 (1998)). Peptides<br>
of chemokine receptors bound to Eotaxin confirmed this finding. Eotaxin has four<br>
cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
inventive composition comprises an amino-acid linker containing a cysteine residue<br>
as second attachment site and being, preferably, fiised to the C-tenninus of the<br>
Eotaxin sequence. In other preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a<br>
free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the<br>
sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the<br>
mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. The genes coding for<br>
these specific constructs are cloned in a suitable expression vector.	<br>
Eotaxin can be chemically synthesized (Clark-Lewis et al, Biochemistry 30:3128-3135 (1991)). Expression in E. coli has also been described for Eotaxin-1, in the cytoplasm (Crump et al, J. Biol Chem. 273: 22471-9 (1998)). Expression in E. coli as inclusion bodies with subsequent refolding (Mayer et a/., Biochemistry 39: 8382-95 (2000)), and Insect cell expression (Forssmann et aL, J, Exp. Med, 185: 2171-6 (1997)) have been described for Eotaxin-2, and may, moreover, be used to arrive at the specific embodiments of the invention.<br>
In yet another specific embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). M-CSF or CSF-1 is a<br><br>
regulator of proliferation, differentiation and survival of macrophages and their bone-marrow progenitors. The receptor for M-CSF is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, encoded by the protooncogene cfms. An elevated expression of M-CSF and its receptor has been associated with poor prognosis in several epithelial cancers such as breast, uterine and ovarian cancer. Tumor progression has been studied in a mouse strain resulting from the crossing of a transgenic mouse susceptible to mammary cancer (PyMT) with a mouse containing a recessive null mutation in csf-1 gene. These mice show attenuated late stage invasive carcinoma and pulmonary metastasis compared to the PyMT mouse (lin et al Exp. Med, 193:121-139 (2001)). The cause seems to be the absence of macrophage recruitment to neoplastic tissues. Subcutaneous growth of Lewis lung cancer is also impaired in csf.l null mice. It is postulated that the mecanism of macrophage enhancement of tumor growth would be through angiogenic factors, growth factors and proteases produced by the macrophages.<br>
Structural data on the soluble form of M-CSF are available (crystal structure: Pandit et al. Science 255:1358-62 (1992)), and show that both the N- and C-termini . of the protein are accessible. However, the N-terminus is close to the site of interaction with the receptor. In addition, M-CSF is present both in a soluble and cell surface form, where the transmembrane region is at its C-terminus. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a cysteine and being, preferably, added at the C-terminus of M-CSF or fragments thereof, or preferably at the C-terminus of the soluble form of M-CSR In further preferred embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-ternMnus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein or of the soluble form of the protein, or inserted at die N-tenmnus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein or of the soluble form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. M-CSF is a dimer, where the two monomers are linked via an interchain disulfide bridge.<br>
An expression system in E., coli has been described for an N-terminal 149 amino acid fragment (functional) of M-CSF (Koths et aU Mol Reprod. Dev. 46:3U 37 (1997)). This fragment of M-€SF, preferably modified as outlined above, represents a preferred antigenic determinant in accordance with the invention.<br>
The human sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 247 (Accession: NP„000748). Further preferred antigenic determinants of the present invention comprise the N-terminal fragment consisting of residue 33 -181 or 33 -185 of SEQ ID No: 247, corresponding to the soluble form of the receptor.<br>
The mouse sequence (Accession. NP_031804) is shown in sequence ID No: 248. The mature sequence starts at amino acid 33. Thus, a preferred antigenic<br><br>
determinant in accordance with the present invention comprises amino-acid 3'3 -l»l or 33-185,<br>
bi another specific embodiment, the antigenic determinant is Resistin (Res)» Passive immunization studies were performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against a fusion protein of mouse Resistin (mRes) fused to GST, expressed in bacteria. TTiis passive immunization lead to improved glucose uptake in an animal obesity/ Type n diabetes model (Steppan et aU Nature 409; 307-12 (2001)).<br>
Resistin (Res) is a 114 aa peptide hormone of approximately 12 KD. It contains 11 cysteine of which the most N-terminal one was shown to be responsible for the dimerisation of the protein and the other 10 are believed to be involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds (Banetjee and Lazar, J. Biol Chem. 276: 25970-3 (2001)), Mutation of the first cysteine to alanine abolishes the dimerisation of mRes.<br>
It was shown, that mRes with a FLAG tag at its C-tenninus still remains active in an animal model (Steppan et al,. Nature 409: 307-12 (2001)), similarly a C-tenninally HA taged (Haemagglutinin tag) version of resistin was shown to be active in a tissue culture assay (Kim et cd., J. Biol Chem, 276: 11252-6 (2001)), suggesting that the C-terminus is not very sensitive to introduced modifications. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the inventive composition comprises an amdno-acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-terminus of the resistin sequence. In furdier preferred embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-tenninus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br>
For a preferred embodiment of the present invention, MRes or huRes may also be expressed as Fc fusion molecules with a protease cleavage site inserted between Resistin and the Fc part of the construct, preferably C-terminally of one or more cysteine residues of the hinge region of the Fc part of the fiasion protein in a eukaryotic expression system, or more preferably according to the descriptions and disclosures of EXAMPLE 2. Cleavage of the fusion protein releases Resistin additionally comprising either an'aminoacid linker containing a cysteine residue as described in EXAMPLE 2, or part or all of the hinge region of the Fc part of the fusion protein which comprises a cysteine residue at its C-terminus, which is suitable for coupling to VLPs or Pili. The human Resistin sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 249 (Accession AF323081). The mouse sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 250 (Accession AF323080). A favored embodiment of the invention is human resistin protein fused at its C-terminus to an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue. Human resistin construct can be generated according to the teachings disclosed in EXAMPLE 2, and by comparing murine and human Resistin sequences in a protein<br><br>
sequence alignment to identify the part of the sequence of human Resistin to be cloned in the vectors described in EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 2 according to the teachings of EXAMPLE 2, or in other suitable expression vectors. Example of human resistin constructs suitable for generating compositions of the inventions are human iesistin-C"Xa: (SEQ ID NO:325), human resistin-C-EK: (SEQ ID NO:326) and human lesistin-C: (SEQ ID NO:327).<br>
Human Resistin constructs so generated are a preferred embodiment of the invention. Vaccination against Resistin using the aforementioned compositions of the invention may thus provide a way of treating Type n Diabetes and obesity.<br>
In another embodiment the antigenic determinant is Lymphotoxin-p. Immunization against lymphotoxin-P may be usefiil in treating Prion mediated disease. Scrapie (a prion-mediated disease) agent replication is believed to take mainly place in lymphoid tissues and was shown to depend on prion-protein expressing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (Brown et al. Nature Med. 11\ 1308-1312 (1999)). It was subsequenfly shown that mice lacking functional follicular dendrite cells show an impaired prion replication in spleens and a (small) retardation of neuroinvasion (Montrasio et al, Science 288: 1257-1259 (2000)). This was achieved by injecting the mice with a soluble lymphotoxin-P receptor-Fc-fusion protein (LTpR-Fc). This soluble receptor construct inhibits the development of FDCs by interfering with the crucial interaction of lymphotoxin-p on T, B or NK cells with the lymphotoxin-P receptor on the FDC precursor cells. Thus, vaccination against lymphotoxin-P (also called TNFy) may provide a vaccine for treatment or prevention of Creutzfeld-Jakob (variant form) or other prion-mediated diseases and thus prevent prion replication and neuroinvasion.<br>
Immunization against LyiB5)hotoxin-P may also provide a way of treating diabetes. Transgene expression of soluble LTPR-Fc fusion protein in nonobese diabetic NOD mice blocked diabetes development but not insulitis (Ettinger et al., J. Exp. Med. 193: 1333^0 K (2001)). Wu et al (J, Exp. Med. 193: 1327-32 (2001)) also used NOD mice to study the involvement of lymphotoxin-p, but instead of transgenic aiumals they did inject the LTPR-Fc fusion protein. They saw a strong inhibition of diabetes development and inhibition of insulitis. Most interestingly, they could even reverse preexisting insulitis by the fusion protein treatment. In the pancreas the formation of lymphoid follicular structures could thus be reversed. Vaccination against lymphotoxin-p may thus provide a way of treatment against type-I diabetes.<br>
The sequence of the extracellular domain of human lymphotoxin-P is shown in SEQ ID No: 250 (TNFC_human) and the sequence of the extracellular domain of murine lymphotoxin-p is shown in SEQ ID No: 251 (TNFC^mouse).<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the inventive composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine and being added to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the processed form of lymphotoxin-p, or inserted between the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the mature form of the protein, and the signal peptide, C-terminally to the signal peptide. In further preferred embodiments of the invention, the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-P is expressed as a fusion protein either with Glutathion-S-transferase, fused N-terminally to lymphotoxin-P, or with a 6 histidine-tag followed by a myc-tag, fused again N-terminally to the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-p. An amino acid spacer containing a protease cleavage site as well as a linker sequence containing a free cysteine as attachment site, C-terminally to the protease cleavage site, axe fused to the N-terminus of the sequence of the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-p. Preferably, the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-P consists of fragments corresponding to amino acids 49-306 or 126-306 of lymphotoxin-p. These specific compositions of the invention may be cloned and expressed in the pCEP-Pu eukaryotic vector. In ftirther preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions conoprise an aminoacid linker containing a free cysteine residue suitable as second attachment site, and being fused to the C-teiminus of lymphotoxin-p or lymphotoxin-P fragments. In a particularly favored embodiment, the amino acid sequence LACGG, comprising the amino acid linker ACGG which itself contains a cysteine residue for coupling to VLPS and Pili is fused to the N-terminus of the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-P : or of a fragment of the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-p, yielding the proteins human C-LT 49.306 (SEQ ID NO:346) and human C-LT*126-306 (SEQ ID NO:347) after cleavage with enterokinase of the corresponding fusion proteins expressed either in vector pCEP-SP-GST-EK or vector pCP-SP-his-myc-EK as described in EXAMPLE 3,<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antigen or antigenic detCTminant is the prion protein, fragments thereof and in particular peptides of the prion protein. In one embodiment the prion protein is the human prion protein. Guidance on how to modify human prion protein for association with the cpre particle is given throughout the application and in particular in EXAMPLE 7. Mouse prion protein constructs are disclosed, and human prion protein constructs can also be generated and have, for example, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 348. Further constructs con^sc the whole human prion protein sequence, and other fragments of the human prion protein, which arc furthw: composition of the invention. Immunization against prion protem may provide a way of treatment or prevention of Creutzfeld-Jakob (variant form) or other prion-mediated diseases. Immunization using the compositions of the invention comprising the prion protein may provide a way of treatment against prion mediated diseases in other animals, and the corresponding sequences of bovine and sheep prion<br>
protein constructs are given in SEQ ID NO:349 and SEQ ID NO:350, respectively. The peptides of the human prion protein corresponding to the murine peptides described in EXAMPLE 8, and of amino acid sequence CSAMSRPIIHFGSDYEDRYYRENMHR<br><br>
("human cprplong") and CGSDYEDRYYRENMHR ("human cprpshort") lead to preferred embodiments of the invention. These peptides comprise an N-terminal cysteine residue added for coupling to VLPs and Pili. Corresponding bovine and sheep peptides are CSAMSRPUHFGNDYEDRYYRENMHR ("bovine cprplong") and CGNDYEDRYYRENMHR ("bovine cprpshort") CSAMSRPIJHFGNDYEDRYYRENMYR ("sheep cprplong") and CGNDYEDRYYRENMYR ("sheep cprpshort"), all leading to embodiments of the invention.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), fragments thereof or peptides of TM-a In particular, peptides or fragments of TNF-a can be used to induce a self-specific immune response directed towards the whole protein by inmiunizing a human or an animal with vaccines and cordpositions, respectively, comprising such peptides or fragments in accordance with the invention. Preferably, VLPs, bacteriophages or bacterial pili are used as core particle, to which TNF-a, peptides or fragments thereof are attached according to the invention.<br>
The following murine peptides are the murine homologs to human peptides that have been shown to be bound by antibodies neutralizing the activity of TNF-a_(Yone et al J. Biol CherrL270: 19509-19515) and were, in a further preferred embodiment of the invention, modified with cysteine residues for coupling to VLPs, bacteriophages or bacterial pili.<br>
MuTNFa peptide: the sequence CGG was added at the N-terminus of the epitope consisting of amino acid residues 22-32 of mature murine TNF-a: CGGVEEQLEWLSQR.<br>
3'TNF n peptide: the sequence GGC was fused at the C-terminus of the epitope consisting of amino acid residues 4-22 of mature murine TNF-a and glutamine 21 was mutated to glycine. The sequence of the resulting peptide is; SSQNSSDKPVAHWANHGVGGC.<br>
5'TNF H peptide: a cysteine residue was fused to the N-terminus of the epitope consisting of amino acid residues 4-22 of mature murine TNF-a and<br><br>
glutamine 21 was mutated to glycine. The sequence of the resulting peptide is: CSSQNSSDKPVAHWANHGV.<br>
The corresponding human sequence of the 4-22 epitope is SSRTPSDKPVAHWANPQAEGQ. like for the murine sequence a cysteine is, preferably, fused at the N-terminus of the epitope, or the sequence GGC is fused at the C-terminus of the epitope for covalent coupling to VLPs, bacteriophages or bacterial pili according to the invention. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention that other cysteine containmg sequences are fused at the N- or C^termini of the epitopes. In general, one or two glycine residues are preferably inserted between the added cysteine residue and the sequence of the epitope. Other amino acids may, however, also be inserted instead of ^ycine residues, and these amino acid residues will preferably be small amino acids such as serine.<br>
The human sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 22-32 is QLQWLNRRANA. Preferably, the sequence CGG is fused at the N-terminus of the epitope for covalent coupling to VLPs or bacterial pili according to the invention. Other TNF-a_epitopes suitable for using in the present invention have been described and are disclosed for example by Yone et aZ. (J. BioL Chem,270:19509-19515).<br>
The invention further includes compositions which contain mimotopes of the antigens or antigenic determinants described herein.<br>
The specific composition of the invention comprises an antibody or preferably an antibody fragment presented on a virus-like particle or pilus for induction of an immune response against said antibody. Antibodies or antibody fragments which are produced by lymphoma cells, may be selected for attachment to the virus-like particle and inmiunization, in order to induce a protective immune response against the lymphoma.<br>
In other furfh^ embodiments, an antibody or antibody fragment micMcking an antigen is attached to the particle. The minaicking antibody or antibody fi-agment may be generated by immunization and subsequent isolation of the mimicking antibody or antibody fragment by any known method known to the art such as e.g. hybridoma technology (Gherardi, E. et al., J, Immunol. Metiiods 126:61-68 (1990)), phage display (Harrison etal, Methods Enzymol 267: 83-109 (1996)), ribosome display (Hanes, J, et al, Nat. Biotechnol 18:1287-1292 (2000), yeast two-hybrid (Visintin, M. et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 96: 11723-11728 (1999)), yeast surface display (Boder, ET. &amp; Wittrup, KD. Methods. Enzym. 328:430-444 (2000)), bacterial surface display (Daugherty, PS. etal, Protein Eng. 12: 613-621 (1999)). The mimicking<br><br>
antibody may also be isolated from an antibody library or a naiVe antibody library using methods known to the art such as the methods mentioned above, for example.<br>
to a further embodiment, an antibody recognizing the combining site of another antibody, i.e. an anti-idiotypic antibody, further called the immunizing antibody, may be used. The antibody recognized by the anti-idiotypic antibody will be further referred to as the neutralizing antibody. Thus, by immunizing against the anti-idiotypic antibody, molecules with the specificity of the neutralizing antibody are generated in situ; we will further refer to these generated antibodies as the induced antibodies, to another preferred embodiment, the inununizing antibody is selected to interact with a ligand molecule of the target molecule against which immunization is seeked The ligand molecule may be any molecule interacting with the target molecule, but will preferentially interact with the site of the target molecule against which antibodies should be generated for inhibition of its function. The ligand molecule may be a natural ligand of the target molecule, or may be any engineered, designed or isolated ligand having suitable binding properties.<br>
The immunizing antibodies may be of human origin, such as isolated from a naive or immune hmnan antibody library, or may have been isolated from a library generated from another animal source, for example of murine origin.<br>
Coupling of the antibody or antibody fragment to the VLP or pilus is achieved either by limited reduction of exposed disulfide bridges (for example of the interchain disulfide bridge between CHI and CK or CA, in a Fab fragment) or by fusion of a linker containing a free cysteine residue at the C-terminus of the antibody or antibody fragment, to a further embodiment, a linker containing a free cysteine residue is fused to the N-terminus of the antibody or antibody fragment for attachment to a VIP or pilus protein.<br>
A number of vaccine compositions which employ mimotopes are known in the art, as are methods for generating and identifying mimotopes of particular epitopes. For example, Amon et cd,. Immunology 101:555-562 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe n^motope peptide-based vaccines against Schistosoma mahsonL The mimotopes uses in these vaccines were obtained by screening a solid-phase 8mer random peptide library to identify mimotopes of an epitope recognized by a protective monoclonal antibody against Schistosoma mansoni. Similarly, Olszewska et al, Virology 272:98-105 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe the<br><br>
identification of synthetic peptides which mimic an epitope of the measles vims fusion protein and the use of these peptides for the immunization of mice. In addition, Zuercher et cd„ Eur. /. Immunol 5(7:128-135 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe compositions and methods for oral anti-IgE immunization using epitope-displaying phage. In particular, epitope-displaying Ml 3 bacteriophages are employed as carriers for an oral anti-IgE vaccine. The vaccine compositions tested contain mimotopes and epitopes of the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody BSW17.<br>
The invention thus includes vaccine compositions which contain mimotopes that elicit immunological responses against particular antigens, as well as individual mimotope/core particle conjugates and individual mimotope/non-naturally occurring molecular scaffold conjugates which make up these vaccine compositions, and the use of these vaccine compositions to elicit immunological responses against specific antigens or antigenic determinants. Mimotopes may also be polypeptides, such as anti-idiotypic antibodies. Therefore, in a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is an anti-idiotypic antibody or anti-idiotypic antibody fragment<br>
Tlie invention further includes compositions which contain mimotopes of the antigens or antigenic determinants described herein.<br>
Mimotopes of particular antigens may be generated and identified by any number of means including the screening of random peptide phage display libraries {see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 97/31948, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Screening of such libraries will often be performed to identify peptides which bind to one or more antibodies having specificity for a particular antigen.<br>
Nfimotopes suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention may.be linear or circular peptides. Mimotopes which are linear or circular peptides may be linked to non-natural molecular scaffolds or core particles by a bond which is not a peptide bond.<br>
As suggested above, a number of human IgE mimotopes and epitopes have been identified which elicit immunological responses against human IgE molecules. {See, e,g., PCT Publication No. WO 97/31948.) Thus, in certain embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which elicit an immunological response against immunoglobin molecules (^.g., IgE molecules).<br>
Peptides which can be used to elicit such immunological responses include proteins, protein subunits, domains of IgE molecules, and mimotopes which are capable of eliciting production of antibodies having specificity for IgE molecules.<br><br>
Generally, portions of IgE molecules used to prepare vaccine compositions will be derived from IgE molecules of the species from which the composition is to be administered.

C.       Preparation of the AlphaVaccine Particles<br>
The invention provides novel compositions and methods for the construction of ordered and repetitive antigen arrays. As one of skill in the art would know, the conditions for the assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array depend to a large extent on the specific choice of the first attachment site of the non-natural molecular scaffold and the specific choice of the second attachment site of the antigen or antigenic detemiinant. Tlius, practitioner choice in the design of the composition (j.e., selection of the first and second attachment sites, antigen and non-natural molecular scaffold) will determine the specific conditions for the assembly of the AlphaYaccine particle (&amp;e ordered and repetitive antigen array and--non-natural molecular scaffold combined). Information relating to assembly of the AlphaVaccine particle is well within the working knowledge of the practitioner, and numerous references exist to aid the practitioner (e.g., Sambrook, J. et a/., eds., MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989); Ausubel, F. et al., eds.. CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John H Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1997); Celis, J., ed., CELL BIOLGY, Academic Press, 2nd edition, (1998); Harlow, E. and Lane, D., "Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual," Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the JUN and FOS leucine zipper protein domains are utilized for the first and second attachment sites of the invention, respectively. In the preparation of AlphaVaccine particles, antigen must be produced and purified under conditions to promote assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array onto the non-natural molecular scaffold. In the particular JUNIFOS leucine zipper protein domain embodiment, the FOS-antigen or F05-antigenic determinant should be treated with a reducing agent (e.g„ Dithiothreitol (DTT)) to reduce or eliminate the incidence of disulfide bond formation (Example 15).<br>
For the preparation of the non-natural molecular scaffold (i.e., recombinant Sinbis virus) of the JUNIFOS leucine zipper protein domain embodiment, recombinant E2-JUN viral particles should be concentrated, neutralized and treated with reducing agent {see Example 16).<br>
Assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array in the JUNIFOS embodiment is done in the presence of a redox shuffle. El-JUN viral particles are combined with a 240 fold molar excess of F05-antigen or F05-antigemc determinant for 10 hours at 4C. Subsequently, the AlphaVaccine particle is concentrated and ptirifiedby chromatography (Example 16).<br>
1	In another embodiment of the invention, the coupling of the non-<br>
natural molecular scaffold to the antigen or antigenic determinant may be accomplished by chemical cross-linking. In a specific embodiment, the chemical agent is a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent such as e-maleimidocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Tanimori et oZ., /. Pharnt Dyru 4:812 (1981); Fujiwara et al., /. Immunol Meth 45:195 (1981)), which contains (1) a succinimide group reactive with amino groups and (2) a maleimide group reactive with SH groups. A heterologous protein or polypeptide of the first attachment site may be engineered to contain one or more lysine residues that will serve as a reactive moiety for the succinimide portion of the heterobifunctional cross-linking agent. Once chemically coupled to the lysine residues of the heterologous protein, the maleimide group of the heterobifunctional ..cross-linking agent will be available to react with the SH group of.-a- cysteine residue on the antigen or antigenic determinant. Antigen or antigenic determinant preparation in this instance may require the engineering of a cysteine residue into the protein or polypeptide chosen as the second attachment site so that it may be reacted to the free maleimide function on the cross-linking agent bound to the non-natural molecular scaffold first attachment sites. Thus, in such an instance, the heterobifunctional cross-linking agent binds to a first. attachment site of the non-natural molecular scaffold and connects the scaffold to a second binding site of the antigen or antigenic determinant.<br><br>
3.       Compositions, Vaccines, and the Administration Thereof, and Methods - of Treatment<br>
The invention provides vaccine compositions which may be used for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions. The invention further provides vaccination methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions in individuals.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides vaccina for the prevention of infectious diseases in a wide range of species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines may be designed to treat infections of viral etiology such as HIV, influenza. Herpes, viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles, chicken pox, etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, etc.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides vaccines for the prevention of cancer in a wide range of species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines may be designed to treat all types of cancer: lymphomas, carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, etc.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, compositions of the invention may be used in the design of vaccines for the treatment of allergies. Antibodies of the IgE isotype are important components in allergic reactions. Mast cells bind-IgE antibodies on their surface and release histamines and other mediators of allergic response upon binding of specific antigen to the IgE molecules bound on the mast cell surface. Inhibiting production of IgE antibodies, therefore, is a promising target to protect against allergies. This should be possible by attaining a desired T helper cell response. T helper cell responses can be divided into type 1 (THI) and type 2 (TH2) T helper cell responses (Romagnani, Immunol Today 15:263-266 (1997)). THI cells secrete interferon-gamma and other cytokines which trigger B cells to produce IgGl-3 antibodies. In contrast, a critical cytokine-produced by TH2 cells is IL-4, which drived B cells to produce IgG4 and IgE. In many experimental systems, the development of THI and TH2 responses is mutually exclusive sinceTHl cells suppress the induction of TH2 ceUs and vice versa. Thus, antigens that trigger a strong THI response simultaneously suppress the development of TH2 responses and hence the production of IgE antibodies. Interestingly, virtually all viruses induce a THI response in the host and fail to trigger the production of IgP antibodies (Coutelier et ol,, J, Exp, Med 165:64-69 (1987)).  This isotype pattern is not restricted to live<br><br>
Man et al, Eur J. Immunol 25:1401-1407 (1998)), Thus, by using the processes of the invention (e.g., AlphaVaccine Technology), viral particles can be decorated with various allergefis and used for immunization. Due to the resulting "viral structure" of the allergen, a THI response will be elicited, "protective" IgGl-3 antibodies will be produced, and the production of IgE antibodies which cause allergic reactions will be prevented Since the allergen is presented by viral particles which are recognized by a different set of helper T cells than the allergen itself, it is likely that the allergen-specific IgGl-3 antibodies will be induced even in allergic individuals harboring preexisting TH2 cells specific for the allergen. The presence of high concentrations of IgG antibodies may prevent binding of allergens to mast cell bound IgE, thereby inhibiting the release of histamine. Thus, presence of IgG antibodies may protect from IgE mediated allergic reactions. Typical substances causing allergies include: grass, ragweed, birch or mountain cedar pollens, house dust, mites, animal danders, mold, insect venom or drugs (e.g., penicillin). Thus, immunization of individuals with allergen-decorated viral particles should be beneficial not only before but also after the onset of allergies.<br>
In specific embodiments, the invention provides methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions which are caused or exacerbated. by "self gene products (e.g., tumor necrosis factors), i.e. "self antigens" as used herein. In related embodiments, the invention provides methods for inducing immunological responses in individuals which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate diseases or conditions are caused or exacerbated by "self* gene products. Examples of such diseases or conditions include graft versus host disease, IgE-mediated allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, Crohn's disease, allergic asthma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Graves disease, inflammatory autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), immunoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy (IPL), angioimmunoproliferative lymphadenopathy (AIL)» immuniSblastive lymphadenopathy (IBL), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, when compositions of the invention are administered to an individual, they may be in a composition which contains salts, buffers, adjuvants, or other substances which are desirable for improving the efficacy of the composition. Examples of materials suitable for use in preparing pharmaceutical compositions are provided in numerous sources including REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Osol, A, ed.. Mack Publishing Co., (1990)).<br><br>
Compositions of the invention are said to be "pharmacologically acceptable" if their administration can be tolerated by a recipient individual. Further, the compositions of the invention will be administered in a "therapeutically effective amount" (i.e., an amount that produces a desired physiological effect).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered by various methods known in the art, but will normally be administered by injection, infusion, inhalation, oral administration, or other suitable physical methods. The compositions may alt^natively be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. Components of compositions for administration include sterile aqueous {e.g., physiological saline) or non-aqueous solutions and suspensions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Carriers or occlusive dressings can be used to increase skin permeability and enhance antigen absorption.<br>
Prion-mediated diseases are an increasing threat for society. Specifically, prion-induced BSE in cattle represents a disease that has long been neglected and may affect a great number of animals throughout Europe. Moreover, a variant form of CJD is attributed to infection of humans after consumption of meat of prion-infected cattle. Although the number of infected people has been relatively low so far, it seems possible that the disease may become epidemic. However, long-term prognosis for the development of vCJD may be particular difficult, since incubation times between infection and overt disease are very long (an estimated 10 years).<br>
Prions are cellular proteins existing in most manmialian species. Prion proteins exist in two forms, a normally folded form that is usually present in healthy individuals OPrP*0 and a misfolded form tiiat causes disease (Prpsc. The current prion hypotheses postulates that the misfolded prion fonn Prp^^ can catalyse the refolding of healthy prion PrP^ into disease causing Prp^^ (A. Aguzzi, Haematologica 85, 3-10 (2000)). In some rare instances, this transition may also occur spontaneously, causing classical CJD in humans. Some mutations in PrP° are associated with an incifease in this spontaneous transition, causing the various forms of familial CJD. However, Prp^*^ may also be infectious and may be transmitted by blood transfusion or via the food chain. The latter form of prion mediated disease is known as Kuru Kuru and used to occur in human cannibals. However, since species that are feeding on their own individuals are not abundant, this form of orally transmitted disease was too rare to be documented for other species.<br>
The miassive feeding of cows with beef-products throughout Europe now<br><br>
changed the situation and numbers of cows infected with a transmissible form of BSE-causing Prpsc dramatically increased in recent years, afflicting hundreds of thousands of cows. This sudden appearance of massive numbers of BSE-diseased cows caused great fear in the human population that a similar disease may be induced in humans. Indeed, in 1996, the first case of a variant form of CJD was reported that cguld be attributed to the consumption of Prp^^ infected beef. Until now, this fear has further increased, since the number of infected humans has constantly increased during the following years and no cure is in sight Moreover, since sheep succumb to a prion-mediated disease called scrapie and since other mammalian species can be infected with Prp^*^<br>
Experimentally, it is possible that BSE-like diseases may occur also in other species. The mechanism of prion transmission has been studied in great detail. It is now clear that prions first replicate in the lymphoid organs of infected mice and are subsequently transported to the central nervous system. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), a rare cell population in lymphoid organs, seems to be essential for both replication of prion proteins in the lymphoid organs and transport into the central nervous system (S. Brandner, M. A. Klein, A. Aguzzi, Transfus Clin Biol 6, 17-23 (1999); F. Montrasio, et al., Science 288,1257-9 (2000)). EDCs are a poorly studied cell type but it is now clear that they depend upon the production of lymphotoxin and/or TNF by B cells for their development (F. Mackay, J. L. Browning, Nature 395, 26-27 (1998)). Indeed, mice deficient for lymphotoxin do not exhibit FDCs (M. S. Matsumoto, et al.. Science 264, 703-707 (1996)). Moreover, they fail to be productively infected with prions and do not succumb to disease. In addition to FDCs, antibodies may also play a role in disease progression (S. Brandner, M. A. Klein, A. Aguzzi, Transfus Clin Biol 6,17-23 (1999)).<br>
Recently, it was shown that blocking the LTb pathway using a Ltb receptor Fc fusion molecule not only eliminates FDCs in mice but also blocks infection with PrP^' (F. Montrasio, et al., Science 288,1257-9 (2000). Thus, a -vaccine that induces antibodies specific for LTb or its receptor inay be able to block transmission of PrPscfrom one individual to another or from the periphery to the central nervous system.<br>
However, it is usually difficult if not impossible to induce antibody responses to self-molecules by conventional vaccination. One way to improve the efficiency of vaccination is to increase the degree of repetitiveness of the antigen applied: Unlike isolated proteins, viruses induce prompt and efficient immune responses in the absence of any adjuvants both with and without T -cell help (Bachmann &amp; Zintemagel.Ann, Rev. Immunol:  15:235-270 (1991)). Although<br><br>
viruses often consist of few proteins, they are able to trigger much stronger inunime responses than their isolated components. For B-cell responses, it is known that one crucial factor for the immunogenicity of viruses is the repetitiveness and order of surface epitopes. Many viruses exhibit a quasi- crystalline surface that displays a regular array of epitopes which efficiently crosslinks epitope-specific inamunoglobulins on B cells (Bachmann &amp; Zinkemagel, Immunol. Today 17:553-558 (1996)). This crosslinking of surface immunoglobulins on B cells is a strong activation signal that directly induces cell- cycle progression and the production of IgM antibodies. Further, such triggered B cells are able to activate T helper cells, which in turn induce a switch from IgM to IgG antibody production in B cells and the generation of long-lived B cell memory - the goal of any vaccination (Bachmann &amp; Zinkemagel, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15:235-270 (1997)). Viral structure is even linked to the generation of anti-antibodies in autoinmiune disease and as a part of the natural response to pathogens (see Fehr, T., et al., J Exp. Med. 185:1785-1792 (1997)). Thus, antibodies presented by a highly organized viral surface are able to induce strong anti-antibody responses.<br>
The immune system usually fails to produce antibodies against self-derived structures. For soluble antigens present at low concentrations, this is due to tolerance at the Th cell level. Under these conditions, coupling the self-antigen to a carrier that can deliver T help may break tolerance. For soluble proteins present at high concentrations or membrane proteins at low concentration, B and Th cells may be tolerant However, B cell tolerance may be reversible (anergy) and can be broken by administration of the antigen in a highly organized fashion coupled to a foreign carrier (Bachmaim &amp; Zinkemagel, Ann. Rev. Immunol 15:235-270 (1997). Thus, LTb, LTa or LTb receptor as highly organized as a vims, a virus like particle or a bacterial pilus may be able to break B cell tolerance and to induce antibodies specific for these molecules.<br>
The present invention is related to the fields of molecular biology, virology, immunology and medicine. The invention provides a method that facilitates induction of antibodies specific for endogenous lymphotoxin (LT)b, LTa or LTb receptor. The invention also provides a process for producing an antigen or antigenic determinant that is able to elicit antibodies specific for LTb, LTa or LTb receptor which is useful for the prevention and therapy of prion-mediated diseases such as variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCID) or bovine spongioform encephalopathy (BSE) and elimination of lymphoid organ like structures in autoimmune diseased tissues.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a vaccine that is able to induce antibodies specific for LTb, LTa or LTb receptor thereby eliminating FDCs<br><br>
from lymphoid organs. This treatment may allow preventing infection with PrPsc or spread of PrPsc from the periphery to the central nervous system'. In addition, this treatment blocks generation of lymphoid organ like structures in organs targeted by autoimmune disease and may even dissolve such existing structures, ameliorating disease symptoms.<br>
LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof are coupled to a protein carrier tiiat is foreign to the host In a preferred embodiment of the invention, LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof will be coupled to a highly organized stracture in order to render these molecules highly repetitive and organized. The highly organized structure may be a bacterial pilus, a virus like particle (VLP) generated by recombinant proteins of the bacteriophage QP, recombinant proteins of Rotavirus, recombinant proteins of Norwalkvirus, recombinant proteins of Alphavirus, recombinant proteins of Foot and Mouth Disease virus, recombinant proteins of Retrovirus, recombinant proteins of Hepatitis B virus, recombinant proteins of Tobacco mosaic virus, recombinant proteins of Flock House Virus, and recombinant proteins of human Papillomavirus. In order to optimize the three-dimensional arrangement of LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof on the highly organized structure, an attachment site, such as a chemically reactive amino-acid, is introduced into the highly organized structure (unless it is naturally there) and a binding site, such as a chemicaUy reactive amino acid, will be introduced on the LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments (unless it is naturally there). The presence of an attachment site on the highly organized structure and a binding site on the LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof will allow to couple these molecules to the repetitive structure in an oriented and ordered fashion which is essential for the induction of efficient 6 cell responses.<br>
In an equally preferred embodiment, the attachment site introduced in the repetitive structure is biotin that specifically binds streptavidin. Biotin may be introduced by chemical modification. LTb, LTa or LTb recq)tor or fragments thereof<br>
■ 'v<br>
may be fused or linked to streptavidin and bound to the ,biotinylated repetitive structure.<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Modular eukaryotic expression system for coupling of antigens to VLPs<br>
This system was generated in order to add various amino acid linker sequences containing a cysteine residue to antigens for chemical coupling to VLPs.<br>
A. Construction of an EBNA derived expression system encoding a cysteine-containing amino acid linker and cleavable Fc-Tag:<br>
pCep-Pu (Wuttke et al. I Biol Chem. 276: 36839-48 (2001)) was digested with Kpn I and Bam HI and a new multiple cloning site was introduced with the annealed oligonucleotides PH37 (SEQ ID NO:270) and PH38 (SEQ ID NO:271) leading to pCep-MCS.<br>
A modular system containing a free cysteine flanked by several glycines, a protease cleavage site and the constant region of the human IgGl was generated as follows. pSec2/Hygro B (Invitrogen Cat. No. V910-20) was digested with Bspl20I and Hind IE and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides SU7 (SEQ ID NO:278) and SU8 (SEQ ID NO:279) leading to construct pSec-B-MCS. pSec-B-MCS was then digested with Nhe I and Hind III and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides PH29 (SEQ ID NO:264) and PH30 (SEQ ID NO:265) leading to construct pSec 29/30. The construct pSec-FL-EK-Fc* was generated by a three fragment ligation of the foUowing fragments; first pSec 29/30 digested with Eco RI and EBnd DDL, the annealed oligonucleotides PH31 (SEQ ID NO:266) and PH32 (SEQ ID NO. 267) and the Bgl I/EcoRI fragment of a plasmid (pSP-Fc*-Cl) containing a modified version of the human IgGl constant region (for details of the hu IgCxlr sequence see the sequence of the final construct pCep-Xa-Fc* see FIG. lA-lC). The complete sequence of pCep-Xa-Fc* is given in SEQ ID NO:283. The resulting construct was named pSec-FL-EK-Fc*. From this plasmid the linker region and the human IgGl Fc part was excised by Nhe 1, Pme I digestion and cloned into pCep-MCS digested with Nhe I and Pme I leading to construct pCep-FL-EK-Fc*. Thus a modular vector, was created where the linker sequence and the protease cleavage site, which are located between the Nhe I and Hind HI sites, can easily be exchanged with annealed oligonucleotides. For the generation of cleavable fusion protein vectors pCep-FL-EK-Fc was digested with<br><br>
Nhe I and Hind HI and the Factor Xa cleavage site N-terminally flanked with amino acids GGGGCG was introduced with the annealed oligonuclotides PH35 (SEQ ID NO:268) and PH36 (SEQ E) NO:269) and the enteroldnase site flanked n-tenninaUy with GGGGCG was introduced with the annealed oligonucleotides PH39 (SEQ ID NO:272) and PH40 (SEQ ID NO:273) leading to the constructs pCep-Xa-Fc* (see no. lA) and pCep-EK-Fc* (see FIG.

IC) which in addition contains a eukaryotic signal peptide was generated by a three fragment ligation of pCep-EK-Fc* digested Kpn 1/ Bam HI, the annealed oUgos PH41 (SEQ ID NO:274) and PH42 (SEQ ID NO:275) and the annealed oUgos PH43 (SEQ ID NO:276) and PH44 (SEQ ID NO:277).<br>
B.	Large Scale production of fusion proteins:<br>
For the large scale production of the different fusion proteins 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with the different pCep expression plasmids with lipofectamine 2000 reagent (life technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 24-36 h post transfection the cells were split at a 1 to 3 ratio under puromycin selection (l|xg/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS. The resistant cells were then expanded in selective medium. For the harvesting of the fusion proteins the resistant cell population were passed onto poly-L-lysine coated dishes. Once the cells had reached confluence, they were washed 2 times with PBS and serum free medium (DMEM) was added to the plates. The tissue culture supernatant were harvested every 2 to 4 days and replaced with fresh DMEM medium during a period of up to one month. The harvested supematants were kept at 4 °C.<br>
C.	Purification of the fusion proteins:<br>
The recombinant Fc-fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using protein A .sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AG). Briefly chromatography columns were packed with 1-3 ml protein A resin and the tissue culture supematants containing the recombinant proteins were applied to the column with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0.5 - 1.5 ml/min. The colunm was then washed with 20-50 ml PBS. Depending on the fusion protein the protease cleavage was performed on the colunm or the protein was eluted as described below. Recombinant fusion proteins were eluted with a citrate/ phosphate buffer (pH 3.8)<br><br>
supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and the fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated with ultraftee centrifugal filters (Millipore).<br>
D. Protease cleavage of recombinant fusion proteins (Factor Xa, enterokinase):<br>
Eluted recombinant fusion proteins containing the enterokinase (EK) cleavage site were cleaved using the EKmax system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cleaved Fc part of the fusion protein was removed by incubation with protein A. The enterokinase was then removed with the EK-Away system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers recommendation. Similarly fusion proteins containing the factor Xa (Xa) cleavage site were cleaved using the restriction protease factor Xa cleavage and removal kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cleaved Fc part was removed by incubation with protein A and the protease was removed with the streptavidin resin provided with the kit.<br>
The different fusion proteins were concentrated with ultrafree centrifugal filters (Millipore), quantitated by UV spectrophotometrie and used for subsequent coupling reactions.<br>

Eukaryotic expression and coupling of mouse resistin to VLPs and Pili<br>
A. Cloning of mouse Resistin:<br>
Total RNA was isolated from 60 mg mouse adipose tissue using a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The RNA was elated in 40 \\1 H2O. This total RNA was than used for the reverse transcription with an oligo dr primer using the ThennoScript™ RT-PCR System (Life Technologies) according to the manufactxirer's recommendation. The sample was incubated at 50 ^C for Ih, heated to 85 ""C for 5 minutes and treated for 20 minutes at 37 °C with RNAseH.<br>
2 fU of the RT reaction weie used for the PCR amplification of mouse resistin. Hie PC^ was performed using Platinium TAQ (life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendation using primers PH19 (SEQ ID NO:260) and PH20 (SEQ ID NO:261). Primer PH19 (SEQ ID NO:260) corresponds to positions 58-77 and primer PH20 (SEQ ID NO:261) to positions 454-435 of the mouse Resistin sequence. The PCR mix was first denatured at 94 °C for 2 minutes and than 35 cycles were performed as follows: 30 seconds 94 °C, 30 seconds 56 °C and 1 minute 72 °C, at the end the samples were left for 10 minutes at 72 ^C.

The protein GST-PS-C-RANKL was eluted with 50 mM Tiis-HCl, pH=8.0 containing GSH10 mM.<br>
The purified GST-PS-C-RANKL protein was digested using the protease PreScission (Amersham Pharmacia). The digestion was performed at 37°C for 1 hour using a molar ratio of 500/1 of GST-PS-C-RANKL to PreScission,<br>
Furthermore, the reaction of protease digestion was buffer exchanged using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia), the fractions containing the proteins were pooled and immediately used for another step of GST affinity chromatography using the same conditions reported before. Purification of C-RANKL was analysed on a SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, shown in Fig.6. Molecular weights of marker proteins are given on the left margin of the gel in the figure. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The cleaved C-RANKL is present in the flow-through (unbound fi-action) while the uncleaved GST-PS-C-RANKL, the cleaved GST-PS and the PreScission remain bound to the column.

A. Cloning of IL-5 for expression as Inclusion bodies in £. coli<br>
IL-5 was amplified from an ATCC clone (pmIL5-4G; ATCC number: 37562) by PCR using the following two primers: SpeUnker3-Fl (SEQ ID NO:340) and USStopXho-R (SEQ ID NO:342). The product of this PCR was used as template for a second PCR with the primers SpeNlinker3-F2 (SEQ ID NO:341) and I15StopXho-R. The insert was digested with Spel and Notl. This insert was ligated into a pET vector derivative (pMODEC3-8 vector), previously digested with Nhel and Notl (not dephosphorylated), and transformed into Exoli TGI cells. The IL5 construct generated by cloning into pMODEC3-8 vector contains at its N-terminus a hexa-histidine tag, followed by an enterokinase site, an N-terminal gamma 3 amino acid link^ containing a cysteine residue, flanked C-terminaliy by the sequence AS and N-temainally by the sequence ALV, and the mature form of the IL 5 gene. The protein released by cleavage with enterokinase is called "mouse C-IL-5-E" (SEQ ID NO:332). Plasmid DNA of resulting clone pMODC6-IL5.2 (also called pM0DC6-IL5), whose sequence had been confirmed by DNA sequencing, was transformed into JS.coZi strain BL2L<br>

The resulting vaccines were termed "Qb-Ab 1-15". "Qb-Ab 1-27" and "Qb-Ab 33-42". 8 months old female APP23 mice which carry a human APP transgene (Sturchler-Pierrat et al, ProcNaXl AcadScl USA 94:13287-13292 (1997)) were used for vaccination. The mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 µg vaccine diluted in sterile PBS and 14 days later boosted with the same amount of vaccine. Mice ware bled from the tail vein before the start of immunization and 7 days after the booster injection. The sera were analyzed by BUS A.<br>
B.	EUSA<br>
AP 1-40 and AP 1-42 peptide stocks were made in DMSO and diluted in coating buffa: before use, ELIS A plates were coated with 0.1 | µg /well AP 1-40 or Ap 1-42 peptide. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse serum. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. As a control, sera obtained before vaccination were also included. The s^iun dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline was calculated and defined as "ELIS A titer". All three vaccines tested were immunogenic in APP23 mice and induced high antibody titers against the A6 peptides 1-40 and/or AB 1-42. The results are shown in HO. 20. No specific antibodies were detected in 'preimmune sera of the same mice (not shown).<br>
Shown on FIG. 20 are the ELIS A signals obtained on day 22 with the sera of the mice immunized with vaccines Qb-Ab 1-15, Qb-Ab 1-27 and Qb-Ab 33-42, respectively. Mice A21-A30 received the vaccine Qb-Ab 1-15, mice A31-A40 received Qb-Ab 1-27 and mice A4149 received Qb-Ab 33-42. For each mouse, Ap 1-40 and AP 1-42 peptide-specific serum antibody titers were determined on day 21 by ELISA. The ELSIA titers defined as the serum dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline are shown for individual mice. Mice vaccinated<br><br>
with Qb-Ab 1-15 or Qb-Ab 1-27 made high antibody titers against both βp 1-40 and βp 1-42 whereas mice vaccinated with Qb-Ab 33-42 had only high antibody titers against the βp 1-42 peptide. The very strong immune responses obtained with the human AB peptides in the transgenic mice expressing human A6 transgene, demonstrate that by coupling βp peptides to Qβ cβpsid protein, tolerance towards the self-antigen can be overcome.<br>

EXAMPLE 19 Desensitization of allergic mice witih PLA2 coupled to Qβ cβpsid protein<br>
C.     Desensitization of allergic mice by vaccination<br>
Female CBA/J mice (8 weeks olct) were sensitized with PLA2: Per mouse, 0.1 ug PLA2 from Latoxan (France) was adsorbed to 1 mg Alum (Imject, Pierce) in a total volume of 66 ul by vortexing for 30 min and then injected subcutaneously. This procedure was repeated every 14 days for a total of four times. This treatment led to the development of PLA2-specific serum IgE but no IgG2a antibodies. 1 month after the last sensitization, mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 ug vaccine consisting of recombinant PLA2 coupled to Qβ cβpsid protein. One and 2 weeks later they were again treated with the same amount of vaccine. One week after the last<br><br><br>
B.     EQSA<br>
ELISA plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with PLA2 (Latoxan) at 5 figi^ml. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted serum. For the detection of IgE antibodies, serum was pnetreated with protein G beads Pharmacia) for 60 min on a shaker at room temperature. The beads were removed by CMitrifugation and the supernatant was used for ELISA. Antibodies bound to PLA2 were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG2a or IgE antibodies. EIJSA titers were determined at half maximal optical density (OD50%) and expressed as -logS of 100-fold prediltued sera for IgG2a and as -logS of 10-fold prediluted sera for IgE. For all mice, PLA2-specific IgG2a and IgE in serum were determined before and at the end of the vaccine treatment. Vaccination led to a dramatic increase of PLA2-specific IgG2a whereas no consistent changes in IgE titers were noted. These results indicate that the vaccination led to an induction of a Thl-like immune response (reflected by the production of IgG2a). Results are shown in FIG, 25 B.<br>

An overnight culture was grown in dYT medium containing 100 µg/ml Ampicillin and 15 µg/Dol Chloramphenicol. The culture was diluted in fresh dYT medium containing Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol, and grown at 3TC until OD eoo nm= 1 was reached. The culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and grown for another 4 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml Lysozyme. After incubation on ice, cells were sonicated on ice, and MgCh added to a concentration of 10 mM. 6 µg of Benzonase Merck) were added to the cell lysate, and the lysate was incubated 30 minutes at RT. Triton was added to a final concentration of 1 %, and the lysate was further incubated for 30 minutes on ice. The inclusion body (IB) pellet was collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 g. The inclusion body pellet was washed in wash buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 23% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The IBs were solubilized in 6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mM DTT. The solubilized IBs were centrifuged at 50000 g and the supernatant dialyzed against 6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and subsequently against the same buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT. Oxidized glutathion<br><br>

B.	Refolding and purification<br>
The IB solution was added slowly in three portions, every 24 h., to a final concentration of 3 pM, to the refolding buffer containing 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM Benzamidin, 0.2 mM 6 aminocβpronic acid, 0.2 mM Guanidinium-HCl, 0.4 M L-Arginin, pH 6.8, to which 5 mM reduced Glutathion and 0.5 mM oxidized Glutathion were added prior to initiation of refolding at 4°C. The refolding solution was concentrated to one half of its volume by Ultrafiltration using a YMIO membrane (Millipore) and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mM DTT. The protein was fiirth^ concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded onto a Superdex G-75 colunm (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 4 °C for purification. The pH of the equilibration buffer was adjusted to 7.2 at RT. The monomeric fractioiis were pooled.<br>

A solution of 1.5 mg Qβ in 0.75mL 20mM Hepes,150mM NaCl, pH 7.4<br>
was reacted with 0.06mL Sulfo-SMPB (Pierce; 31 mM Stock in H20) for 45 min. at RT. The^reaction mixture was dialyzed overnight against 20mM Hepes,150mM NaCI, pH 7.4 and 0.75 mL of this solution were mixed with 1.5 mL of a PLA2"Cys solution in 0.1 mM DTT (62 \JM) and 0.43 mL of 20mM Hepes, 150mM NaCl, 137 µMDTT, pH 7.4 adjusted at RT. The coupling reaction was left to proceed for 4 h. at RT, and the reaction mixture was dialyzed overnight against 20mM Hepes,150mM NaCl, pH 7.4 using Spectra Por dialysis tubing, MW cutoff 300 000 Da (Spectrum). The coupling reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining, and Western<br><br>
blotting, using either a rabbit anti-bee venom antiserum (diluted 1:10000), developed with a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (diluted 1:10000), or a rabbit anti-Qβ antiserum (1:5000), developed with a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (diluted 1:10000).

EXAMPLE 21 Coupling of anti-idiotypic I^E mimobody YAE051 to Qβ, immunization<br>
of mice and testing of antis^^a<br>
A solution of 4.0 mg/ml Qβ cβpsid protein in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 was reacted for 30 minutes with 10 fold molar excess SMPH (Pierce) (from a IDO mM stock solution dissolved in DMSO) at 25 *C on a rocking shaker. The reaction solution was subsequently dialyzed twice for 2 hours against 2 I of 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 at 4 *C. The VAE051 solution (2.4 mg/ml) was reducted with an equimolar concentration of TCEP for 60 min at 25 ^C.<br>
46 yH of the dialyzed Qβ reaction mixture was then reacted with 340 \il of the TCEP-treated VAE051 solution (2.4 mg/ml) in a total volume of 680 µg of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at<br>
16 ^C for 2 h on a rocking shaker.<br><br>
The reaction products were analysed on 16% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The two additional band in the coupling reactions (which are absent in VAE or Qβ solutions) represent the heavy chain and the  µght chain of the VAE051 coupled to Qβ (HG, 28 A). Identity of the bands were confinned by Western blotting with antibodies specific for heavy and  µght chains, respectively.<br>
Immunization of n[iice<br>
The Qβ-VAE051 coupling solution was dialysed against 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM Naa, pH 7.2 using a membrane with a cut-off of 300000 Da. 50 |xg of the Qβ-VAE051 were injected intrβperitoneal in two female Balb/c mice at day 0 and day 14. Mice were bled retroorbitally on day 28 and their serum was analyzed using IgE- and VAE051-specific BUS As.<br>
EUSA<br>
ELIS A plates were coated with human IgE at a concentration of 0.8 fig/ml or with 10 µg/mJ VAE05L The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse sera. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (FIG. 28 B).<br>
Both mice showed high reactivity to VAE051 as well as the human IgR Preimmune sera of the same mice did not show any reactivity against VAE051 and IgE (HG. 28 B). This demonstrates that antibodies against the anti-idiotypic I^ mimobody VAE051 have been produced which also recognize the "parent" molecule IgE.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 23 Insertion of a peptide containing a Lysine residue into the c/el epitope of<br>
HBcAg(l-149)<br><br>
The c/el epitope (residues 72 to 88) of HBcAg is located in the tip region on the surface of the Hepatitis B virus cβpsid (HBcAg). A part of this region (Proline 79 and Alanine 80) was genetically replaced by the peptide Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (HBcAg-Lys construct). The introduced Lysine residue contains a reactive amino group in its side chain that can be used for intermolecular chemical crosslinking of HBcAg particles with any antigen containing a free cysteine group.<br>
HBcAg-Lys DNA, having the amino acid sequence shown in SBQ ID<br>
NO:158, was generated by PCRs: The two fragments encoding HBcAg fragments<br>
(amino acid residues 1 to 78 and 81 to 149) were amplified separately by PCR. The<br>
primers used for these PCRs also introduced a DNA sequence encoding the Gly-Gly-<br>
Lys-Gly-Gly peptide. The HBcAg (1 to 78) fragment was amplified from pEco63<br>
using primers EcoRIHBcAg(s) and Lys-HBcAg(as). The HBcAg (81 to 149)<br>
fragment was amplified from pEco63 using primers Lys-HBcAg(s) and HBcAg(l-<br>
149)Hind(as).	Primers    Lys-HBcAg(as)    and    Lys-HBcAg(s)    introduced<br>
complementary DNA sequences at the ends of the two PCR products allowing fusion of the two PCR products in a subsequent assembly PCR. The assembled fragments were amplified by PCR using primers EcoRlHBcAg(s) and HbcAg(l-149)Hind(as).<br>
For the PCRs, 100 pmol of each o µgo and 50 ng of the template DNAs were used in the 50 ml reaction mixtures with 2 units of Pwo polymerase, 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. For both reactions , temperature cycling was carried out as follows: 94X for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94X (1 minute), SO'^C (1 minute), 72°C (2 minutes).<br>

For fusion of the two PCR fragments by PCR 100 pmol of primers EcoRIHBcAg(s) and HBcAg(l-149)Hind(as) were used with 100 ng of the two purified PCR fragments in a 50 ml reaction mixture containing 2 units of Pwo polymerase, 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. PCR cycling conditions were: 94°C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C (1 minute), 50°C (1 minute), ITC (2 minutes). The assembled PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified and digested for 19 hours in an βppropriate buffer with EcoRI and Hindin restriction enzymes. The digested DNA fragment was Iigated into EcoRI/EEndni-digested pKK vector to generate pKK-HBcAg-Lys expression vector. Lisertion of the PCR product into the vector was analyzed by EcoRI/Ifindin restriction analysis and DNA sequencing of the insert<br>
EXAMPLE24 Expression and partial purification of HBcAg-Lys<br><br>
E, coli strain XL-1 blue was transformed with pKK-HBcAg-Lys. 1 ml of an overnight culture of bacteria was used to innoculate 100 ml of LB medium containing 100 jug/nfl ampicillin. This culture was grown for 4 hours at 3TC until an OD at 600 nm of βpproximately 0.8 was reached. Induction of the synthesis of HBcAg-Lys was performed by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. After induction, bacteria were further shaken at 37°C for 16 hours. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 15 minutes. The pellet was frozen at -20'*C. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in bacteria lysis buffer (10 mM Na2HP04, pH 7.0, 30 mM NaCl, 0.25% Tween-20, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT) supplemented with 200 µg /ml lysozyme and 10 ^1 of Benzonase (Merck). Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and disrupted using a French pressure cell. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the lysate was incubated for 30 minutes on ice and shaken occasionally. E. coli cells haiboring pKK-HBcAg-Lys expression plasmid or a control plasmid were used for induction of HBcAg-Lys expression with IPTG. Prior to the addition of IPTG, a sample was removed from the bacteria culture carrying the pKK-HBcAg-Lys plasmid and fix&gt;m a culture carrying the control plasmid. Sixteen hours "after addition of IPTG, samples were again removed from the culture containing pEIK-HBcAg-Lys and from the control culture. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.<br>
The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 12,000 x g in order to remove insoluble cell debris. The supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against HBcAg (YVS1841, purchased fix)m Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY, USA), indicating that a significant amount of HBcAg-Lys protein was soluble. Briefly, lysates fi"om £. coli cells expressing HBcAg-Lys and from control cells were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 minutes. Supernatant (= soluble fraction) and pellet (= insoluble fraction) were separated and diluted with SDS sample buffer to equal volumes. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-HBcAg monoclonal' antibody YVS "1841.<br>
The cleared cell lysate was used for step-gradient centrifugation using a sucrose step gradient consisting of a 4 ml 65% sucrose solution overlaid with 3 ml 15% sucrose solution followed by 4 ml of bacterial lysate. The sample was centrifuged for 3 hrs with 100,000 x g at 4°C. After centrifiigation, 1 ml fractions from the top of the gradient were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The HBcAg-Lys protein was detected by Coomassie staining.<br>
The HBcAg-Lys protein was enriched at the interface between 15 and 65% sucrose indicating that it had formed a cβpsid particle.  Most of the bacterial<br><br>
proteins remained in the sucrose-free upper layer of the gradient, therefore step-gradient centrifugation of the HBcAg-Lys particles led both to enrichment and to a partial purification of the particles,<br>

Synthetic FLAG peptide with a Cysteine residue at its amino .terminus (amino acid sequence CGGDYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO: 147)) was coupled chemically to purified HBcAg-Lys particles in order to elicit an immune response against the FLAG peptide. 600 ml of a 95% pure solution of HBcAg-Lys particles (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the heterobifunctional cross-linker N-Succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyIdithio) propionate (SPDP) (0.5 mM). After completion of the reaction, the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 50 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaQ to remove free SPDP. Hien 500 ml of derivatized HBcAg-Lys cβpsid (2 mg/ml) were mixed with 0.1 mM FLAG peptide (containing an amino-terminal cysteine) in the presence of 10 mM EDTA to prevent metal-catalyzed sulfhydryl oxidation. The reaction was monitored through the increase of the optical density of the solution at 343 nm due to the release of pyridine-2-thione from SPDP upon reaction with the free cysteine of the peptide. The reaction of derivatized Lys residues with the peptide was complete after βpproximately 30 minutes.<br>
The FLAG decorated particles were injected into mice.<br>

EXAMPLE 27 Expression of pMPSVgpl40Cys<br>
pMPSVgpl40Cys (20 fig) was linearized by restriction digestion. The reaction was stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an isopropanol precipitation of the linearized DNA. The restriction digestion was evaluated by agarose gel eletrophoresis. For the transfection, 5.4 (ig of linearized pMPSVgpl40-Cys was mixed with 0.6 fig of linearized pSV2Neo in 30 jxl ifeO and 30 jxl of 1 M CaCl2 solution was added. After addition of 60 [il phosphate buffer (50 mM HEPES, 280 mM NaQ, 1.5 niM Na2 HPO4, pH 7.05), the solution was vortexed for 5 seconds, followed by an incubation at room temperature for 25 seconds. The solution was immediately added to 2 ml HP-1 medium containing 2% PCS (2% PCS medium). The medium of an 80% confluent BHK21 cell culture (6-well plate) was then replaced by the DNA containing medium. After an incubation for 5 hours at 37^C in a CO2 incubator, the DNA containing medium was removed and replaced by 2 ml of 15% glycerol in 2% PCS medium. The glycerol containing medium was removed after a 30 second incubation phase, and the cells were washed by rinsing with 5 ml of HP-1 medium containing 10% PCS. Finally 24nl of fresh HP-1 medium containing 10% FCS was added.<br>
' Stably transfected cells were selected and grown in selection medium (HP-1 medium supplemented with G418) at 37^*0 in a CO2 incubator. When the mixed population was grown to confluency, the culture was split to two dishes, followed by a 12 h growth period at 37*^6. One dish of the cells was shifted to 30°C to induce the expression of soluble GP140-FO5. The other dish was kept at 37°C.<br>
The expression of soluble GP140-Cy5 was determined by Western blot analysis. Culture media (0.5 ml) was methanol/chloroform precipitated, and the pellet W£^ resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 minutes at<br><br>
95°C before being βpplied to a 15% acrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Protan nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Germany) as described by Bass and Yang, in Creighton, T.E,, ed., Protein Function: A Practical βpproach, 2nd Edn., IRL Press, Oxford (1997), pp. 29-55. The membrane was blocked with 1 % bovine albumin (Sigma) in TBS (lOxTBS per liter: 87.7 g NaCl, 66.1 g Trizma hydrochloride (Sigma) and 9.7 g Trizma base (Sigma), pH 7.4) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by an incubation with an anti-GP140 or GP-160 antibody for 1 hour. The blot was washed 3 times for 10 minutes with TBS-T (TBS with 0.05% Tween20), and incubated for 1 hour with an alkaline-phosphatase-anti-mouse/rabbit/monkey/human IgG conjugate. After washing 2 times for 10 minutes with TBS-T and 2 times for 10 minutes with TBS, the development reaction was carried out using alkaline phosphatase detection reagents (10 ml βp buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 9.5) with 50 µg NBT solution (7.7% Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (Sigma) in 70% dimethylformamide) and 37 µg of X-Phosphate solution (5% of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in dimethylformamide).<br>

EXAMPLE 30 Expression and Purification of PLArCys<br><br>
For cytoplasmic production of Cys tagged proteins, E. coli XL-1-Biue strain was transformed with the vectors pAV3::PIA and pPLA-Cys. The culture was incubated m rich medium in the presence of ampicillin at ZTC with shaking. At an optical density (550nm) of, 1 mM IPTG was added and incubation was continued for another 5 hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in an βppropriate buffer {e.g., Tris-HCl, pH 7.2,150 mM NaCl) containing DNase, RNase and lysozyme, and disrupted by passage through a french pressure cell. After centrifugation (Sorvall RC-5C, SS34 rotor, 15000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C), the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml inclusion body wash buffer (20 mM tris-HCl, 23% sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100,1 mM EDTA, pH8) at 4°C and recentrifuged as described above. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant after centrifugation was essentially clear. Inclusion bodies were resuspended in 20 ml solubilization buffer (5.5 M guanidinium hydrochloride. 25 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and subsequent passage of the supernatant throng a sterile jHlter (0.45 /im). The protein solution was kept at 4^*0 for at least 10 hours in the presence of 10 mM EDTA and 100 mM DTT and then dialyzed three times against 10 volumes of 5.5 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 25 mM tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 6. The solution was dialyzed twice against 51 2 M urea, 4 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NH4CI, 20 mM sodium borate (pH 8.3) in the presence of an βppropriate redox shuffle (oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione; cystine/cysteine). The refolded protein was then βpplied to an ion exchange chrouMtogrβphy. The protein was stored in an βppropriate buffer with a pH above 7 in the presence of 2-10 mM DTT to keep the cysteine residues in a reduced form. Prior to coupling of the protein with the alph^virus particles, DTT was removed by passage of the protein solution through a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column.<br>

EXAMPLE 32 Blockage of free cysteine residues of a HBcAg followed by cross-linking<br>
The free cysteine residues of the HBcAg-Lys prepared as described above in Example 23 were blocked using lodacetamide. The blocked HBcAg-Lys was then cross-linked to the FLAG peptide with the hetero-bifiinctional cross-linker m-maleimidonbenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sulfo-MBS).<br><br>
The mettiods used to block the free cysteine residues and cross-link the HBcAg-Lys are as follows. HBcAg-Lys (550µg /nd) was reacted for 15 minutes at room temperature with lodacetamide (Fluka Chemie, Brugg, Switzerland) at a concentration of 50 mM in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride), pH7.2, in a total volume of 1 mi. The so modified HBcAg-Lys was then reacted inamediately with Sulfo-MBS (Pierce) at a concentration of 330µM  directly in the reaction mixture of step 1 for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then cooled on ice, and diaiyzed against 1000 volumes of PBS pH 7.2. The diaiyzed reaction mixture was finally reacted witti 300 j^M of the FLAG peptide (CGGDYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:147)) containing an N-terminal free cysteine for coupling to the activated HBcAg-Lys, and loaded on SDS-PAGE for analysis.<br>
The resulting patterns of bands on the SDS-PAGE gel showed a clear additional band migrating slower than the control HBcAg-Lys derivatized with the cross-linker, but not reacted with the FLAG peptide. Reactions done under the same conditions without prior derivatization of the cysteines with lodacetamide led to complete cross-linking of monomers of the HBcAg-Lys to higher molecular weight species,<br>
EXAMPLE 33<br>
Isolation and chemical coupling of FLAG peptide to Type-1 pili of<br>
Escherichia coli using a heterobifunctional cross-linker<br>
A.       Introduction<br>
Bacterial pili orµM briae are filamentous surface organelles produced by a wide range of bacteria. These organelles mediate the attachment of bacteria to surface receptors of host cells and are required for the establishment of many bacterial infections like cystitis, pyelonephritis, new bom meningitis and dianhea.<br>
., Pili can be divided in different classes with respect to their receptor specificity (agglutination of blood cells from different species), their assembly pathway (extracellular nucleation, general secretion, chβperone/usher, alternate chβperone) and their morphological properties (thick, rigid pili; thin, flexible pili; atypical structures including cβpsule; curli; etc). Examples of thick, rigid pili forming a right handed helix that are assembled via the so called chβperone/usher pathway and mediate adhesion to host glycoproteins include Type-1 pili, P-pili, S-pili, FlC-pili, and 987P-pili). The most prominent and best characterized members of this class of pili are P-pili and Type-1 pili (for reviews on adhesive structures, their assembly and the associated diseases see Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., I Bacteriol 152:1059-1071<br><br>
(1999); Bullitt &amp; Makowsld. Biophys. 1 74:623-632 (1998); Hung. D. L. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., J. Struct, Biol 124:201-220 (1998)).<br>
Type-1 pili are long, filamentous polymeric protein structures on the surface of £. coll They possess adhesive properties that allow for binding to mannose-containing receptors present on the surface of certain host tissues, Type-1 pili can be expressed by 70-80% of all E. coli isolates and a single E. coli cell can bear up to 500 pili. Type- pili reach a length of typically 0.2 to 2 (xM with an average number of 1000 protein subunits that associate to a right-handed helix with 3.125 subunits per turn with a diameter of 6 to 7 mn and a central hole of 2.0 to 2.5 nm.<br>
The main Type-1 pilus component,µM A, which represents 98% of the total pilus protein, is a 15,8 kDa protein. The minor pilus componentsµM F,µM G andµM H are incorporated at the tip and in regular distances along the pilus shaft (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type IµM briae of Escherichia coli,'" in:µM briae, Klemm, P, (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26).µM H, a 29.1 kDa protein, was shown to be the mannose-binding adhesin of Type-1 pili (Krogfelt, K, A., et al, Infect. ImmujL 58:1995-1998 (1990); Klemm, P., et al., Mol Microbiol 4:553-560 (1990); Hanson, M. S. &amp; Brinton. C. C. J., Nature i7:265-268 (1988)), and its incorporation is probably facilitated byµM G and HmF (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol Geru Genetics 205:439-445 (1987); Russell, P. W, &amp; Omdorff, P. E., J. Bacteriol 174:5923-5935 (1992)). Recently, it was shown thatµM H might also form a thin tip-fibrillum at the end of the pili (Jones, C. H., et al., Proc. Nat, Acad Sci. USA 92:2081-2085 (1995)). The order of major and minor components in the individual mature pili is very similar, indicating a highly ordered assembly process (Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., /. Bacteriol i5i:1059-1071 (1999)).<br>
P-pili of E. coli are of very similar architecture, have a diameter of 6.8 nm, an axial hole of 1.5 nm and 3.28 subunits per turn (Bullitt &amp; Makowski, Biophys. 1 74:623-632 (1998)). The 16.6 kDa PβpA is the main component of this pilus type and shows 36% sequence identity and 59% similarity to FmiA (see Table 1). As in Type-1 pili the 36.0 kDa P-pilus adhesin PβpG and specialized adβpter proteins make up only a tiny fraction"of total pilus protein. The most obvious difference to Type-1 pili is the absence of the adhesin as an integral part of the pilus rod, and its exclusive localization in the tip fibrillium that is connected to the pilus rod via specialized adβpter proteins that Type-1 pili lack (Hultgren, S. J., et al, Cell 73:887-901 (1993)).<br><br>

Type-1 pili are extraordinary stable hetero-o µgomeric complexes. Neither SDS-treatment nor protease digestions, boiling or addition of denaturing agents can dissociate Type-1 pili into their individual protein components. The combination of difiFerent methods like incubation at 100°C at pH 1.8 was initially found to allow for the depolymerization and separation of the components (Eshdat, Y., et cd„ J. Bactenol i48:308-314 (1981); Brinton, C.C. J., Trans, N. Y. Acad. ScL 27:1003^1054 (1965); Hanson, A. S., et al,, /. Bactenol, 270:3350-3358 (1988); Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type IµM briae of Escherichia colU*' in:µM briae. Klemm, P. (ed,), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26), Interestingly, Type-1 pili show a tendency to break at positions whereµM H is incorporated upon mechanical agitation, resulting in fragments that present aµM H adhesin at their tips. This was interpreted as a mechanism of the bacterium to shorten pili to an effective length under mechanical stress (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., 'Type IµM briae of Escherichia coli" in:µM briae. Klemm, P, (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). Despite their extraorciinary stability, Type-1 pili have Been shown to unravel partially in the presence of 50% glycerol; they lose their helical structure and form an extended and flexible, 2 nm wide protein chain (Abraham^ S. N., et al, J. Bactenol 77-^:5145-5148 (1992)).<br>
P-pili and Type-1 pili are encoded by single gene clusters on the E. coli chromosome of βpproximately 10 kb (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type IµM briae of Escherichia colU^' in:µM briae. Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press.Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26; Omdorff, P.E. &amp; Falkow, S.. /. Bacterial i60:61-66 (1984)). A total of nine genes are found in the Type-1 pilus gene cluster, and 11 genes in the P-pilus<br><br>
cluster (Hultgren, S. J., et al, Arfv. Prot Chem, 44:99A23 (1993)). Both clusters are Organized quite similarly.<br>
The first two ^m-genes,µM B andµM E, code for recombinases involved in the regulation of pilus expression (McClain, M. S., et al„ J. BacterioL 173:5308-5314 (1991)). The main structural pilus protein is encoded by the next gene of the cluster,/zwzA (Klemm, P., Euro. I Biochem. i45:395-400 (1984); Omdorff, P. E. &amp; Falkow, S., /. Bactenol i60:61-66 (1984); Omdoiff, R E. &amp; Falkow, S., 7. Bacterial 162:454A57 (1985)). The exact role ofµM I is unclear. It has been reported to be incorporated in the pilus as well (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type IµM briae of Escherichia coli' in:µM briae, Klemm, P. (ed.), ORG Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). The adjacent fitnC codes not for a structural component of the mature pilus, but for a so-called pilus chβperone that is essential for the pilus assembly (Klemm. P., Res. Microbiol 74^5:831-838 (1992); Jones, C. H., et al, Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. USA 90:8397-8401 (1993)).<br>
The assembly platform in the outer bsicterial membrane to which the mature pilus is anchored is encoded byµM D (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., MoL Gen, Genetics 220:334-338 (1990)).The three minor components of the Type-1 pili,µM F,µM G andµM H are encoded by the last three genes of the cluster (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., MoL Gen, Genetics 208:439-445 (1987)). βpart fromµM B andµM E, all genes encode precursor proteins for secretion into the periplasm via the sec-pathway.<br>
The sinoilarities between different pili following the chβperone/usher pathway are not restricted to their morphological properties. Their genes are also arranged in a very similar manner. Generally the gene for the main structural subunit is found direcdy dovmstream of the regulatory elements at the beginning of the gene cluster, followed by a gene for an additional structural subunit (fiml in the case of Type-1 pili and pβpH in the case of P-pili). PβpH was shown andµM l is supposed to tenninate pilus assembly (Hultgren, S. J., et aL, Cell 75:887-901 (1993)). The two proteins that guide the process of pilus formation, namely the specialized pilus chβperone and the outer membrane assembly platform, are located adjacently downstream. At the end of the clusters a variable number of minor pilus components including the adhesins are encoded The similarities in morphological structure, sequence (see Table 1), genetic organization and regulation indicate a close evolutionary relationship and a similar assembly process for these cell organelles.<br>
Bacteria producing Type-1 pili show a so-called phase-variation. Either the bacteria are fully piliated or bald. This is achieved by an inversion of a 314 bp genomic DNA fragment containing the fimA promoter, thereby inducing an "all on" or "all off" expression of the pilus genes (McClain, M. S., et al, J. BacterioL<br><br>
775:5308-5314 (1991)), The coupling of the expression of the other structural pilus genes toµM A expression is achieved by a still unknown mechanism. However, a wide range of studies elucidated the mechanism that influences the switching between the two phenotypes.<br>
The first two genes of the Type-1 pilus cluster,µM B mdfimE encode recombinases that recognize 9 bp DNA segments of dyad synametry that flank the invertableµM A promoter. WhereasµM B switches pilation "on",µM E turns the promoter in the "off" orientation. The up- or down-regulation of either fimB orµM E expression therefore controls the position of the so-called "^-switch" McClain, M. S., et al, J. Bacterial i73:5308-5314 (1991); Blomfield, I. C, et al., J. Bacterial J 73:5298-5307 (1991)).<br>
The two regulatory proteinsµM B andµM E are transcribed from distinct promoters and their transcription was shown to be influenced by a wide range of different factors including the integration host factor (fflF) (Blomfield, I. C, et al., Mai Micrabiol 23:105-111 (1997)) and the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (LRP) (Blomfield, I. C, et al, 7. Bacterial 175:21-36 (1993); Gaily, D. L., et al„ X Bacterial 775:6186-6193 (1993); GaUy, D. L., etal, Microbial 27:725-738 (1996); Roesch, R. L. &amp; Blomfield, I. C, Mai Micrabiol, 27:751-761 (1998)). Mutations in the former lock the bacteria either in "on" or "off' phase, whereas LRP mutants switch with a reduced frequency. In addition, an effect of leuX on pilus biogenesis has been shown. This gene is located in the vicinity of theµM -gents on the chromosome and codes for the minor leucine tRNA species for the UUG codon. Whereas ,/imB contains five UUG co6on,µM E contains only two, and enhanced leuX transcription mi^t favorµM B over FiinE expression (Burghoff, R. L., et ai, Infect ImmuTL 57:1293-1300 (1993); Newman, J. V., et d., FEMS Microbial Lett. 722:281-287 (1994); Ritter, A., etal, Mai Microbial, 25:871-882 (1997)).<br>
Furthermore, temperature, medium composition and other environmental factors were shown to influence the activity ofµM B and FunE. Finally, a spontaneous, statistical switching of theyimA promoter has been reported. The frequency of this spontaneous switching is βpproximately 10-3 per generation (Eisenstein, B. I., Science 214:331-339 (1981); Abraham, S. M., et al, Proc Nat, Acad Sci, USA 52:5724-5727 (1985)), but is strongly influenced by the above mentioned factors.<br>
The genes µM i sndfimC are also transcribed from the fimA promoter. but directly downstream ofµM A a DNA segment with a strong tendency to form secondary structure was identified which probably represents a partial transcription terminator (Klemm, P., EurOs J. Biochem. 745:395-400 (1984)); and is therefore supposed to severely reduce fim7 and fimC transcription. At the 3' end offimC an<br><br>
additional promoter controls theµM D transcription; at the 3' end of jimD the last known µM promoter is located that regulates the levels ofµM F,µM G, andµM H. Thus, all of the minor Type-1 pili proteins are transcribed as a single mRNA (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type IµM briae of Escherichia coli," in:µM briae, Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). This ensures a 1:1:1 stoichiometry on mRNA-Ievel, which is probably maintained on the protein level.<br>
In the case of P-pili additional regulatory mechanisms were found when the half-life of mRNA was determined for different P-pilus genes. The mRNA for pβpA was extraordinarily long-lived, whereas the mRNA for pβpB, a regulatory pilus protein, was encoded by short-lived mRNA (Naureckiene, S. &amp; Uhlin. B. E,, Mol Microbiol 2i:55-68 (1996); Nilsson, P., et al, J. Bacterial i7S:683-690 (1996)).<br>
In the case of Type-1 pili, the gene for the Type-1 pilus chβperoneµM C starts with a GTG instead of an ATG codon, leading to a reduced translation efficiency. Finally, analysis of thtfimH gene revealed a tendency of thefimH mRNA to form a stem-loop, which might severely hamper translation. In summary, bacterial pilus biogenesis is regulated by a wide range of different mechanisms acting on all levels of protein biosynthesis,<br>
Periplasmic pilus proteins are generally synthesized as precursors, containing a N-terminal signal-sequence that allows translocation across the inner membrane via the Sec-βpparatus. After translocation the precursors are normally cleaved by signal-peptidase L Stractural Type-1 pilus subunits normally contain disulfide bonds, their formation is catalyzed by DsbA and possibly DsbC and DsbG gene products.<br>
The Type-1 pilus chβperoneµM C lacks cysteine residues. In contrast, the chβperone of P-pili, PβpD, is the only member of the pilus chβperone family that contains a disulfide bond, and the dependence of P-pili on DsbA has been shown explicitly (Jacob-Dubuisson, F., et al„ Proc. Nat. Acad ScL USA Pi:11552-11556 (1994)). PβpD does not accumulate in the periplasm of a 4dsbA strain, indicating that the disturb.ance of the P-pilus assembly machinery is caused by the absence of the chβperone (Jacob-Dubuisson, F., et aU Proc. Nat, Acad. ScL USA 9i:11552-11556 (1994)). This is in accordance with the finding that Type-1 pili are still assembled in a AdsbA strain, albeit to reduced level (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella^ Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
Type-1 pili as well as P-pili are to 98% made of a single or main stmctural subunit termedµM A and PβpA, respectively. Both proteins have a size of -15.5 kDa. The additional minor components encoded in the pilus gene clusters are<br><br>
very similar (see Table 1). The similarities in sequence and size of the subunits with the exception of the adhesins suggest that all share an identical folding motif, and differ only with respect to their affinity towards each other. Especially the N- and C-terminal regions of these proteins are well conserved and supposed to play an important role in chβperone/subunit interactions as well as in subunit/subunit interactions within the pilus (Soto, G, E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., /, Bacterial 181:1059-1071 (1999)). Interestingly, the conserved N-terminal segment can be found in the middle of the pilus adhesins, indicating a two-domain organization of the adhesins where the proposed C-terminal domain, starting with the conserved motif, corresponds to a structural pilus subunit whereas the N-terminal domain was shown to be responsible for recognition of host cell receptors CHultgren, S. J., et aU Proc. Nat Acad, Sal USA 56:4357-4361 (1989); Haslam, D. B., et al„ Mol Microbiol 14\i99-409 (1994); Soto, G. E., et al., EMBO J. 17:6155-6167 (1998)). The different subunits were also shown to influence the morphological properties of the pili. The ■ removal of several genes was reported to reduce the number of Type-1 or P-pili or to increase their length, ifimH, pβpG, pβpK, fiiuF,µM G) (Russell, P. W. &amp; Omdorff, P. K, /. Bacterid 174:5923-5935 (1992); Jacob-Dubuisson, R., et al., EMBO J. i2:837-847 (1993); Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., 7. Bacteriol iSi:1059-1071 (1999)); combination of the gene deletions amplified these effects or led to a total loss of pilation (Jacob-Dubuisson, R., et aU EMBO J. 72:837-847 (1993)).<br>
In non-fimbrial adhesive cell organelles also assembled via chβparones/usher systems such as MyfµM briae and CS3 pili, the conserved C-terminal region is different. This indirectly proves the importance of these C-terminal subunit segments for quaternary interactions (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
Gene deletion studies proved that removal of the pilus chβperones leads to a total loss of piliation in P-pili and Type-1 pili (lindberg, R, et al., /. Bacteriol i7i:6052-6058 (1989); Klemm, P., Res^Microbiol 743:831-838 (1992); Jones, C. H., et al., Proc. Nat Acad Sci USA P0:8397"8401 (1993)). Periplasmic extracts of a AfimC strain showed the accumulation of the main subunitµM A, but no pili could be detected (Klemm, P., Res. Microbiol 743:831-838 (1992)). Attempts to over-express individual P-pilus subunits failed and only proteolytically degraded forms could be detected in the absence of PβpD; in addition, the P-pilus adhesin was purified with the inner meinbrane fraction in the absence of the chβperone (Lindberg, P., et al., J. Bacteriol 777:6052-6058 (1989)). However, co-expression of the stmctural pilus proteins and their chβperone allowed the detection of chβperone/subunit complexes from the periplasm in the case of theµM C/FimH<br><br>
complex as well as in the case of different Pβp-proteins including the adhesin PβpG and the main subunit PβpA (Tewari, R., et aU J^ Biol Chem. 265:3009-3015 (1993); Lindberg, P., et al., J. Bacteriol 171:6052-605^ (1989)). The affinity of chβperone/subunit complexes towards their assembly platform has also been investigated in vitro and was found to differ strongly (Dodson et al, Proc, Natl Acad. Sci USA 90:3670-3674 (1993)). From these results the following functions were suggested for the pilus chβperones.<br>
They are assumed to recognize unfolded pilus subunits, prevent their aggregation and to provide a "folding template" that guides the formation of a native structure.<br>
The folded subunits, which after folding display surfaces that allow subunit/subunit interactions, are then expected to be shielded from interacting with other subunits, and to be kept in a monomeric, assembly-competent state.<br>
Finally, the pilus chβperones are supposed to allow a triggered release of the subunits at the outer membrane assembly location, and, by doing so with different efficiency, influence the composition and order of the mature pili (see also the separate section below).<br>
After subunit release at the outer membrane, the chβperone is free for another round of substrate binding, folding assistance, subunit transport through the periplasm and specific delivery to the assembly site. Since the periplasm lacks energy sources, like ATP, the whole pilus assembly process must be thermodynamically driven (Jacob-Dubuisson, F,, et oL, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci USA 97:11552-11556 (1994)). The wide range of different functions attributed to the pilus chβperones would in^licate an extremely fine tuned cascade of steps.<br>
Several findings, however, are not readily explained with the model of pilus chβperone function outlined above. One example is the existence of muWmeric chβperone/subunit complexes (Striker, R. T., et al,, /. Biol Cherru 269:12233-12239 (1994)), where one chβperone binds subunit dimers or trimers. It is difficult to imagine a folding template that can be "double-booked". .The* studies on the molecular details of chβperone/subunit interaction (see below) partially supported the functions sunmiarized above, but also raised new questions.<br>
All 31 periplasmic chβperones identified by genetic studies or sequence analysis so far are proteins of βpproximately 25 kDa with conspicuously high pi values around 10. Ten of these chβperones assist the assembly of rod-like pili, four are involved in the formation of thin pili, ten are important for the biogenesis of atypically thin structures (including cβpsule-like structures) and two adhesive structures have not been determined so far (Hohngren, A., et al, EMBO J. 27:1617-1622 (1992); Bond, A., et al, J. Mol Evolution 44:199-309 (1997); Smyth,<br><br>
C. L, et al, FEMS Immun. Med Microbiol i5:127439 (1996); Hung, D. L &amp; Hultgren, S. J., J, Struct, Biol 124:201-220 (1998)), The pairwise sequence identity between these chβperones and PβpD ranges from 25 to 56%, indicating an identical overall fold (Hung, D. L„ et al, EMBO J. 75:3792-3805 (1996)).<br>
The first studies on the mechanism of chβperone/substrate recognition was based on the observation that the C-termini of all known pilus chβperones are extremely similar. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-termini of the P-pilus proteins were shown to bind to PβpD in ELISA assays (Kuehn, M. J., et al, Science 252:1234-1241 (1993)). Most importantly, the X-ray structures of two complexes were solved in which PβpD was co-crystallized with 19-residue peptides corresponding to the C-tennini of either the adhesin PβpG or the minor pilus component PβpK (Kuehn. M. J-, et al, Science 262:1234-1241 (1993); Soto, G. E., et al., EMBO J. i7:6155-6167 (1998)). Both peptides bound in an extended conformation to a P-strand in the N-terminal chβperone domain that is oriented towards the inter-domain cleft, thereby extending a p-sheet by an additional strand. The C-terminal carboxylate groups of the peptides were anchored via hydrogen-bonds to Arg8 and Lysll2, these two residues are invariant in the family of pilus chβperones. Mutagenesis studies confirmed their importance since their exchange against alanine resulted in accumulation of non-functional pilus chβperone in the periplasm (Slonim, L. N., et al., EMBO J. Ji:4747-4756 (1992)). The crystal structure of PβpD indicates that neither Arg8 nor Lysll2 is involved in stabilization of the chβperone, but completely solvent exposed (Hohngren, A. &amp; Branden, C. L, Nature 5-^2:248-251 (1989)). On the substrate side the exchange of C-terminal PβpA residues was repoited to abolish P-pilus formation, and similar experiments on the conserved .C-terminal segment of the P-pilus adhesin PβpG prevented its incorporation into the P-pilus (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C, (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756). All evidence therefore indicated pilus subunit recognition via the C-terminal segments of the subunits.<br>
A more recent study on* C-terminal amino acid exchanges of the P-pilus adhesin PβpG gave a more detailed picture. A range of amino acid substitutions at the positions -2, -4, -6, and -8 relative to the C-terminus were tolerated, but changed pilus stability (Soto, G. E., et al, EMBO I 77:6155-6167 (1998)).<br>
Still, certain problems arise when this model is exaxnined more closely. Adhesive bacterial structures not assembled to rigid, rod-like pili lack the conserved C-terminal segments (Hultgren, S. J,, et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756), even though they are also dependent on the presence of<br><br>
related pilus chβperones. This indicates a different general role for the C-terminal segments of pilus subunits, namely the mediation of quaternary interactions in the mature pilus. Moreover, the attempt to solve the structure of a C-terminal peptide in complex with the chβperone by NMR was severely hampered by the weak binding of the peptide to the chβperone (Walse, B., et aU FEES Lett. 472:115-120 (1997)); whereas an essential contribution of the C-tenninal segments for chβperone recognition implies relatively high affinity interactions.<br>
An additional problem arises if the variability between the different subunits are taken into account Even though the C-terminal segments are conserved, a wide range of conservative substitutions is found. For example, 15 out of 19 amino acid residues differ between the two peptides co-crystallized with PβpD (Soto, G. E., et fl/., EMBO /. 77:6155-6167 (1998)). This has been explained by the kind of interaction between chβperone and substrate, that occurs mainly via backbone interactions and not specifically via side-chain interactions. Then again, the specificity of the chβperone for certain substrates is not readily explained. On the contrary to the former argument, the conserved residues have been taken as a proof for the specificity (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, R C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
The outer membrane assembly platform, also termed "usher^' in the literature, is formed by homo-o µgomers ofµM D or PβpC, in the case of Type-1 and P-pili, respectively (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol Gen, Genetics 220:334-338 (1990); Thanassi, D. G., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. SeL USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). Studies on the elongation of Type-1µM briae by electron microscopy demonstrated an elongation of the pilus from the base ^we, M. A., et al, J. BacterioL 7(59:157-163 (1987)). In contrast to the secretion of unfolded subunits into the periplasmic space, the fully folded proteins have to be translocated through the outer membrane, possibly in an o µgomeric form (Thanassi, D. G., et al, Proc. Nat, Acad. Set USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). This requires first a membrane pore wide enough to allow the passage and second a transport mechanism that is thermodynamically driven (Jacob-Dubuisson,F., etal, J. Biol Chem. 259:12447-12455 (1994)).<br>
FimD. expression alone was shown to have a deleterious effect on bacterial growth, the co-expression of pilus subunits could restore normal growth behavior (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol Gen, Genetics 220:334-338 (1990)). Based on this it can be concluded that the ushers probably form pores that are completely filled by the pilus. Electron microscopy on membrane vesicles in which PβpC had been incorporated confirmed a pore-forming structure with an inner diameter of 2 nm (Thanassi, D, G., et al„ Proc. Nat. Acad SeL USA 95:3146-3151<br><br>
VJL770;;. oiiiw uic iiiucr uiauicicr or ine pore is loo small lo aiiow tne passage ot a pilus rod, it has been suggested that the helical arrangement of the mature pilus is formed at the outside of the bacterial surface. The finding that glycerol leads to unraveling of pili which then form a protein chain of βpproximately 2 nm is in good agreement with this hypothesis, since an extended chain of subunits might be fonned in the pore as a first step (Abraham, S. R, et aU J- BacterioL 774:5145-5148 (1992); Thanassi, D. G., et al, Proa Nat. Acad. Set USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). The formation of the helical pilus rod at the outside of the bacterial membrane might then be the driving force responsible for translocation of the growing pilus through the membrane.<br>
It has also been demonstrated that the usher proteins of Type-1 and P-pili form ternary complexes with chβperone/subunit complexes with different affinities (Dodson, K, W., et cd., Proc. Nat, Acad. Sci USA 90:3670-3674 (1993); Saulino, E T., et aU EMBO J. 17:2177-2185 (1998)). This was interpreted as 'Idnetic partitioning" that allows a defined order of pilus proteins in the pilus. Moreover, it has been suggested that structural proteins might present a binding surface only compatible with one other type of pilus protein; this would be another mechanism to achieve a highly defined order of subunits in the mature pilus (Saulino, E. T., etal. EMBO J, 17:2177-2185 (1998)).<br><br>
B.       Production of Type-1 pili from Escherichia coli<br>
E. coli strain W3110 was spread on LB (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 gfL Naa, pH 7.5, 1 % agar (w/v)) plates and incubated at 37°C overnight A single colony was then used to inoculate 5 ml of LB starter culture (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCI, pH 7.5). After incubation for 24 hours under conditions that favor bacteria that produce Type-1 pili (37°C, without agitation) 5 shaker flasks containing 1 lit^ LB w^e inoculated with one milliliter of the starter culture. The bacterial cultures were then incubated for additional 48 to 72 hours at 37°C without agitation. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 4°C, 10 minutes) and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 250 milliliters of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Pili were detached ftom the bacteria by 5 minutes agitation in a conventional mixer at 17.000 rpm. After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C the pili containing supernatant was collected and 1 M MgCla was added to a final concentration of 100 mM. The solution was kept at 4^C for 1 hour, and the precipitated pili were then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4^C). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and the pilus solution was then clarified by a final centrifugation step to remove residual cell debris.<br>

600 III of a 95% pure solution of bacterial Type-1 pili (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the heterobifunctional cross-linker sulfo-MBS (0.5 naM). Thereafter, the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 50 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) vwth 150 mM NaCl to remove free sulfo-MBS. Then 500 µg of the derivatized pili (2 mg/ml) were mixed with 0.5 mM FLAG peptide (containing an amino-terminal Cysteine) in the presence of 10 mM EDTA to prevent metal-catalyzed sufhydryloxidation. The non-coupled peptide was removed by size-exclusion-chromatogrβphy.<br>

EXAMPLE 51 Construction of HBcAgl-183Lys<br>
Hepatitis core Antigen (HBcAg) 1-183 was modified as described in Example 23. A part of the c/el epitope (residues 72 to 88) region (Proline 79 and ^Alanine 80) was genetically replaced by the peptide Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (HBcAgl-183Lys constmct). The introduced Lysine residue contains a reactive amino group in its side chain that can be used for intermolecular chemical crosslinking of HBcAg particles with any antigen containing a free cysteine group. PCR methods essentially as described in Example 1 and conventional cloning techniques were used to prepare the HBcAgl-183Lys gene.<br>
The Gly-GIy-Lys-Gly-Gly sequence was inserted by amplifying two separate fi:agments of the HBcAg gene from pEco63, as described above in Example<br><br>
23 and subsequently fusing the two fragments by PCR to assemble the full length gene. The following PCR primer combinations were used:<br>
fragment 1:<br>
Primer 1: EcoRIHBcAg(s) (see Example 23) Primer 2: Lys-HBcAg(as) (see Example23)<br>
fragment 2: Primer 3: Lys-HBcAg(s) (see Example23) Primer 4: HBcAgwtHindlin CGCGTCCCAAGCTTCTAACATTGAGATTCCCGAGATTG<br>
Assembly: Primer 1: EcoRIHBcAg(s) (see example 23) Primer 2: HBcAgwtHindim<br>
The assembled full length gene was then digested with the EcoRI (GAATTC) and BQndin (AAGCTT) enzymes and cloned into the pKK vector (Pharmacia) cut at the same restriction sites.<br>

A.       Coupling of muTNFa Peptide to HBcAgM83Lys<br>
HBcAgl-183Lys at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml (29 (iM) was treated with iodacetamide as described in Example 32. HBcAgl-183Lys was then reacted with a fifty-fold excess of the cross-linker Sulfo-MBS, as described in Example 32, and dialyzed overnight against 20mM Hepes, pH 7.2, at 4°C.

TTie dialyzed coupling reaction was frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80*^C until immunization of the mice.<br>
Immunization<br><br>
Two mice (female Balb/c) were immunized intravenously at day 0 and 14 with 100 fig HBcAgl-183Lys coupled to the muTNFa peptide, per animal, without adjuvant. Antibodies specific for the muTNFa peptide (coated as a Ribonuclease A conjugate) and for native TNFa protein (Sigma) in the serum were determined at day 21 by ELISA.<br>
ELISA<br>
Murine TNFa protein (Sigma) was coated at a concentration of 2 /ig/ml. As a control, preinomune sera from the same mice used for immunization were tested. FIG. 14 shows the result of the ELISA experiment, demonstrating that immunization with HBcAgl-183Lys coupled to the muTNFa peptide (Full length HBc-TNF) gen^ated an immune response specific for the murine TNFa protein. The sera from mice bled on day 0 (preimmune) and 21 were tested at three different dilutions. Each bar is the average of the signal obtained with sera from two mice. Thus, vaccination with HBcAgl-183Lys coupled to the muTNFa peptide induced an immune response against a self-antigen, since the amino acid sequence of the iriuTNFa peptide is derived from the sequence of mouse TNFa protein.<br>

Murine TNFa protein (Sigma) was coated at a concentration of 2  µg/jxd. As a control, preinomune s^^ &amp;om the same mice used for immunization were tested. FIG, 15 shows the result of the EUSA, demonstrating that immunization with 2cysLys-mut HBcAgl-149 coupled to the 3'TNF n peptide generated an immune response specific for the murine TNFa protein.
