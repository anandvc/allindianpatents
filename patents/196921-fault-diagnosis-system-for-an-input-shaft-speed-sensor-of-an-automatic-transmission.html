				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fault diagnosis system for an input speed sensor of an automatic transmission for a vehicle, and more particularly, to a system that makes it possible to diagnose a fault of the input speed sensor of a vehicle without a vehicle speed sensor when a shift lever is positioned not only in forward running ranges, but also in non-running ranges, and also when the vehicle is operating at a low engine speed.<br>
(b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) generates a fault diagnosis code for indicating faults in an engine control process and units thereof on the basis of a vehicle state that is detected by several sensors, such as a vehicle speed sensor and an engine speed sensor.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows signal processing executed by the ECU.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a sensing means for detecting data on a vehicle state comprises a vehicle speed sensor 11 detecting a vehicle speed, an inhibitor switch 12 detecting a shift lever position, an oil temperature sensor 13 detecting an automatic transmission fluid temperature, a brake switch 14 detecting a brake pedal application, an engine speed sensor 15 detecting an engine speed, an input shaft speed sensor 17 detecting an input shaft speed of a transmission, and an output shaft speed sensor 18 detecting an output shaft<br>
speed of the transmission.<br>
An ECU 20 determines driving conditions or a vehicle state by a predetermined control logic or diagnosis logic on the basis of data detected by the above sensing means, and generates a diagnosis code for units that are malfunctioning.<br>
If there are malfunctioning units, the ECU 20 outputs an error code that is allotted to each malfunctioning unit and informs a driver of the fault by lighting an MIL (Malfunction Indication Lamp) 30.<br>
The ECU 20 determines whether the input shaft speed sensor 17 is malfunctioning by diagnosing an output signal of the input shaft speed sensor under the conditions that a forward running range signal is inputted from the inhibitor switch 12 and a vehicle speed detected by the vehicle speed sensor 11 is higher than a predetermined speed. At this time, if the signal of the input shaft speed sensor 17 is not present, the ECU determines that the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning. The forward running range is D, 3, 2, L, sports mode, or the like.<br>
Also, the ECU 20 determines whether the input shaft speed sensor 17 is malfunctioning by diagnosing a signal of the input shaft speed sensor on condition that the forward running range signal is inputted from the inhibitor switch 12, and an engine speed is higher than an engine stall RPM. At this time, if the signal of the input shaft speed sensor is not present, the ECU determines that the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning.<br>
However, in the aforementioned prior art, the ECU determines whether the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning on the basis of the vehicle speed<br>
sensor signal. Therefore, if the vehicle speed sensor is removed, the fault diagnosis method for the input shaft speed sensor cannot be realized in the prior art. Recently, there has been a tendency to remove the vehicle speed sensor, and therefore the prior art has a problem.<br>
In addition, because it is possible to diagnose a fault of the input shaft speed sensor only when the shift lever is positioned in the forward running range in the prior art, the fault diagnosis method cannot be performed in an N range or a P range.  No claims.<br>
In the case the ECU determines the fault of the input shaft speed sensor on the basis of the engine speed signal, the ECU detects whether the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning only when the engine speed is higher than the stall RPM because there is a possibility of a misjudgment in the engine stall state. Therefore, in a specific engine RPM range the fault diagnosis becomes impossible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the above problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fault diagnosis system in which the fault of the input shaft speed sensor of a vehicle without a vehicle speed sensor can be diagnosed even when the gearshift lever is positioned in the non-running range or the engine speed is low.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a fault diagnosis system for an input shaft speed sensor of an automatic transmission comprising:<br>
a vehicle speed sensor detecting a vehicle speed;<br>
an inhibitor switch detecting a shift lever position;<br>
an oil temperature sensor detecting an automatic transmission fluid temperature;<br>
a brake switch detecting a brake pedal application;<br>
an engine speed sensor detecting an engine speed;<br>
an input shaft speed sensor detecting an input shaft speed of a transmission;<br>

an ECU determining whether the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning based on signals of the above sensors and switches; and<br>
an MIL (Malfunction Indication Lamp) informing a driver of an input shaft speed sensor fault,<br>
wherein the ECU performs an input shaft speed sensor diagnosis comprising:<br>
(a)	determining whether a shift lever is positioned in a forward running range based on a signal of an inhibitor switch;<br>
(b)	determining whether the input shaft speed sensor works properly by reading a first state flag if the shift lever is determined to be not positioned in a forward running range;<br>

faulty according to whether a turbine speed is higher than a predetermined first critical speed, if the temperature of the automatic transmission fluid is higher than the predetermined critical temperature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a fault diagnosis system for an input shaft speed sensor of an automatic transmission according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, and FIGs 2a and 2b show the fault diagnosis method according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the fault diagnosis system for the input shaft speed sensor comprises a vehicle speed sensor 11 detecting a vehicle speed, an<br>
inhibitor switch 12 detecting a shift lever position, an oil temperature sensor 13 detecting an automatic transmission fluid temperature, a brake switch 14 detecting a brake pedal application, an engine speed sensor 15 detecting an engine speed, an input shaft speed sensor 17 detecting an input shaft speed of a transmission, an output shaft speed sensor 18 detecting an output shaft speed of the transmission, an ECU 20 determining whether the input shaft speed sensor is malfunctioning based on signals of the above sensors and switches, and an MIL (Malfunction Indication Lamp) 30 informing a driver of an input shaft speed sensor fault.<br>
The input shaft speed sensor 17 and the output shaft speed sensor 18 A can be respectively realized by a PG-A sensor and a PG-B sensoji„_ <br>
Hereinafter, a fault diagnosis method by the ECU is described in detail with reference to FIGs 2a and 2b.<br>
The ECU 20 determines, by using a signal that is inputted from the inhibitor switch 12, whether the shift lever is positioned in a forward running range. The forward running range indicates all ranges except the P, R and N ranges (ST21).<br>
If it is determined that the shift lever is not positioned in the forward running ranges, the ECU determines whether the input shaft speed sensor 17 works properly (ST22). A fault of the input shaft speed sensor is determined, not by comparing the input shaft speed with the vehicle speed detected by the vehicle speed sensor, but based on a predetermined first-state flag PGA_OK that indicates a state of the input shaft speed sensor 17.<br>
Preferably, the first-state flag PGA_OK is set to have a value of 'FFIY<br>
when the input shaft speed sensor works properly, and the value that is stored in the flag is canceled when an ignition key is turned off.<br>
The first-state flag is stored in a storage device, such as a memory, such that the ECU 20 can access the first-state flag at any time. Thus, the ECU 20 can find a value that is stored in the first flag by reading the memory.<br>
If the input shaft speed sensor 17 is not faulty in step ST22 (that is, PGA_OK = FFh), the ECU 20 determines whether the shift lever is positioned in the P range or the N range based on the signal of the inhibitor switch 12 (ST23).<br>
If the shift lever is determined to be positioned in the P range or the N range in step ST23, the ECU 20 detects the temperature of the automatic transmission fluid (ATF) by using an oil temperature signal, and it determines whether the temperature is higher than a predetermined critical temperature (ST24). Preferably, the predetermined critical temperature can be set as 20 °C.<br>
If the ATF temperature is higher than the predetermined critical temperature, the procedure advances to ®<br>
On the other hand, if the input shaft speed sensor 17 is determined to be faulty in step ST22, the ECU determines whether a turbine speed (Nt) is higher than a predetermined fifth critical speed (ST25). Preferably, the predetermined fifth critical speed can be set at 500 RPM.<br>
If the turbine speed Nt is determined to be higher than the predetermined fifth critical speed in step ST25, the PGA_OK is allotted the value FFh (ST26).<br>
If the shift lever is determined to be positioned neither in the P range nor in the N range in step ST23, if the ATF temperature is determined to be not<br>
higher than the predetermined critical temperature in step ST24, if the turbine speed Nt is determined to be not higher than the predetermined fifth critical speed, or if step ST26 is performed, the procedure advances to (b).<br>
On the other hand, if the shift lever is determined to be positioned in a forward running range in step ST21, the ECU 20 reads a second-state flag PGB_OK that indicates whether the output shaft speed sensor is faulty and determines therewith whether the output shaft speed sensor 18 works properly (ST27). If the output shaft speed sensor works properly, a value stored in the PGB_OK is equal to FFh.<br>
If the output shaft speed sensor 18 is determined to work properly in step ST27 (that is, PGB_OK = FFh), the ECU determines whether an output shaft speed No is higher than a predetermined fourth critical speed (ST32). Preferably, the predetermined fourth critical speed can be set at 1200 RPM.<br>
If the output shaft speed is determined to be higher than the predetermined fourth critical speed in step ST32, the procedure advances to (a).<br>
Contrarily, if the output shaft speed is determined to be not higher than the predetermined fourth critical speed in step ST32, the procedure advances to<br>
(b).<br>
On the other hand, if the output shaft speed sensor is determined to be faulty in step ST27, the ECU 20 determines whether a brake switch 14 works properly by using a third-state flag BRK_SW_OK that so indicates (ST28).<br>
If the brake switch 14 works properly, a value stored in the third-state flag BRK_SW_OK is 'FFh'. The ECU determines whether the brake switch is<br>
faulty by a predetermined control logic.<br>
If the brake switch is determined to work properly in step ST28, the ECU 20 determines whether the brake switch is turned on by using a fourth-state flag BRK_SW that so indicates (ST29).<br>
If the brake switch is turned on, a value stored in the fourth-state flag is 'ON'.<br>
If the brake switch is determined not to be not turned on in step ST29, the ECU 20 determines whether an engine speed detected by the engine speed sensor 15 is higher than a predetermined third critical speed (ST30). Preferably, the predetermined third critical speed can be set at 1800 RPM.<br>
If the brake switch is determined to be faulty in step ST28, or if the brake switch is determined to be turned on in step ST29, the ECU 20 determines whether the engine speed Ne is higher than a predetermined sixth critical speed (ST31). Preferably, the predetermined sixth critical speed can be set at 3000 RPM.<br>
If the engine speed Ne is determined to be higher than the predetermined third critical speed in step ST30, or if the engine speed Ne is determined to be higher than the predetermined sixth critical speed in step ST31, the procedure advances to (b).<br>
Contrarily, if the engine speed is determined to be not higher than the predetermined third critical speed in ST30, or if the engine speed is determined to be not higher than the predetermined sixth critical speed in step ST31, the procedure advances to (b).<br>
Hereinafter, the procedure after (a) and  (b)will  be explained with<br>
reference to FIG 2b.<br>
After (a), the procedure advances to step ST33, where the ECU determines whether a turbine speed Nt is higher than a predetermined first critical speed. Preferably, the predetermined first critical speed can be set at 100 RPM.<br>
If the turbine speed Nt is determined to be not higher than the predetermined first critical speed in step ST33, the ECU 20 determines that the input shaft speed sensor fault is present and adds one to a flag F_CNT that indicates a number of fault diagnoses (ST34).<br>
After step ST34 is performed, the ECU 20 determines whether the fault duration is longer than the predetermined time period.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the fault duration time period 'A' is obtained by multiplying the F_CNT by a diagnosis cycle period.<br>
If the fault duration is longer than the predetermined time period, it is determined that forward counting is finished (ST35). That is, if the sensor fault lasts over the predetermined time period, the ECU determines that the sensor is faulty.<br>
If the forward counting is determined to be finished in step ST35, the ECU adds one to FAIL_CNT (ST36), where FAIL_CNT indicates the number of times the ECU determines the sensor to be faulty.<br>
Then, the ECU 20 determines whether the FAIL_CNT is equal to a predetermined critical number (ST37). Preferably, the predetermined critical number can be set as 4.<br>
If the FAIL_CNT is determined to be equal to 4 in step ST37, the ECU inaugurates a fail-safe mode and turns the MIL (Malfunction Indication Lamp) on such that the driver can recognize the fault of the input shaft speed sensor (ST38).<br>
If the forward counting is determined to be not finished in step ST35, or if the FAIL_CNT value is smaller than the predetermined critical number in step ST37, the ECU 20 performs a suitable safety function in accordance with the FAIL_CNT without informing the driver of the fault (ST39).<br>
After steps ST38 and ST39 are executed, the procedure ends and returns to a main routine.<br>
On the other hand, if the turbine speed is higher than the predetermined first critical speed in step ST33, the ECU determines that the input shaft speed sensor fault is not present. The ECU 20 adds one to a flag B_CNT value that indicates the number of non-fault diagnoses (ST40).<br>
After step ST40 is executed, the ECU 20 determines whether a non-fault duration is longer than a predetermined time period. If the non-fault duration is longer than the predetermined time period, it is determined that backward counting is finished (ST41).<br>
If the backward counting is determined to be finished in step ST41, the ECU 20 allots 'FFh' to the PGA_OK value (ST42).<br>
If the backward counting is determined to be not finished in step ST41, the procedure ends and returns to the main routine.<br>
On the other hand, if the procedure advances to (b) in FIG. 1, the ECU 20 determines that conditions for the fault diagnosis are not fulfilled and the<br>
procedure ends and returns to the main routine.<br>
According to the aforementioned fault diagnosis method, it is possible to determine whether the input shaft speed sensor of the automatic transmission is faulty, by using the signals of the output shaft speed sensor, the brake switch, the engine speed sensor and so on, without making use of the signal of the vehicle speed sensor.<br>
Moreover, even if there are faults in the output shaft speed sensor or the shift lever is positioned in the P range or the N range, or if the engine speed is lower than the stall speed, the fault diagnosis method for the input shaft speed sensor can be available.<br>
In addition to the above, a possibility of a misjudgment caused by a bad N-D hydraulic pressure response at an extremely low temperature can be removed.<br>
