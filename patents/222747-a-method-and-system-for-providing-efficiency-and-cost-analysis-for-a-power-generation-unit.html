				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This disclosure relates to the efficiency and cost analysis of power generation<br>
systems, and more specifically, describes a system and method to analyze the<br>
efficiency and impact on cost of steam-turbine operation during steam path audits.<br>
Generally, estimating the efficiency and the impact on cost of the efficiency of<br>
a steam-turbine power generation system is a complicated, labor-intensive process.<br>
Typically, performance engineers visit power generation sites (i.e., sites using steam-<br>
turbine power generation) during scheduled outages to examine the condition of the<br>
steam turbines and to makes recommendations for maintenance to improve the<br>
efficiency and lower the operating cost of the steam turbine. In order to improve the<br>
efficiency, and thus lower the operating cost of the steam turbine, performance<br>
engineers must calculate the efficiency of the steam turbine at each stage. Once the<br>
current efficiency factors are known at each stage, the performance engineer must use<br>
established guidelines and educated guesses as to what maintenance and/or repairs<br>
must be performed on each section of the turbine and determine the impact of the<br>
maintenance and/or repairs to the turbine's efficiency and the operating cost.<br>
Since power generation sites may have limited budgets for maintenance, they<br>
may require several alternative proposals. At a minimum, they require a proposal in<br>
order to determine the cost-benefit equation. The engineer performing the audit must<br>
calculate the steam turbine efficiency from the measurement of clearances resulting<br>
from wear during the turbine operation and other changes in the turbine from its<br>
initial design condition. The effect of changes in these measurements require<br>
execution of engineering analysis programs to calculate the impact on the turbine<br>
efficiency. Preparing the input for the engineering analysis programs is frequently a<br>
time-consuming and error prone process.<br>
The engineer performing the audit will typically prepare a detailed report for<br>
the power system site identifying the condition of the steam-turbine power generation<br>
system and making recommendations for maintenance and repairs. This report<br>
includes the engineer's observations and results from the engineering analysis<br>
performed to support the recommendations. Preparing the report, including formatting<br>
for printing, is a time-consuming process.<br>
Traditionally, the reports for the power sites have been delivered as draft<br>
copies printed on paper from portable printers, followed by final copies printed from<br>
color printers and mailed from headquarters.<br>
Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the<br>
aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This disclosure describes a system and method for providing efficiency and<br>
cost analysis of power generation systems operation. Briefly described, in<br>
architecture, the system can be implemented as follows. The system of this disclosure<br>
includes a current condition data acquisition logic that acquires a plurality of current<br>
condition variables for the power generation unit. A design constants acquisition<br>
logic acquires a plurality of design constants for the power generation unit; and an<br>
analysis logic calculates a operational efficiency of the power generation unit.<br>
This disclosure can also be viewed as describing a method for providing for<br>
providing efficiency and cost analysis of power generation systems. In this regard,<br>
the method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: acquiring a plurality<br>
of current condition variables for the power generation unit, and acquiring a plurality<br>
of design constants for said power generation unit. With the current condition<br>
variables and design constants, the method calculates an operational efficiency of the<br>
power generation unit.<br>
Other features and advantages of this disclosure will become apparent to one<br>
with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed<br>
description. It is intended that all such additional features and advantages be included<br>
herein within the scope of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the description of the invention as<br>
illustrated in the drawings. Although the invention will be described in connection<br>
with these drawings, there is no intent to limit it to the embodiment or embodiments<br>
disclosed therein. On the contrary, the intent is to include all alternatives,<br>
modifications, and equivalents included within the spirit and scope of the invention as<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a block diagram of possible system<br>
configurations that illustrate the flexibility and platform independence of the<br>
efficiency and cost analysis system and method of the present invention. While the<br>
efficiency and cost analysis system configurations could take many forms, the<br>
diagram of FIG. 1 illustrates a plurality of computer systems 5, 6, 16 and 18 that may<br>
be connected to a power generation system 7 (i.e. steam turbine) either directly or by<br>
network. The network can be for example, but is not limited to, a dial-in, coaxial<br>
cable, Ethernet, LAN, WAN, PSTN, Intranet and/or Internet networks 8 and 17. Each<br>
of the computer systems in FIG. 1 are uniquely illustrated to emphasize that<br>
efficiency and cost analysis system may operate on diverse hardware platforms. In<br>
configurations where the steam-turbine power generation system 7 is not connected to<br>
a computer system, the engineer measures and inspects the turbine and physically<br>
records the results, which then are entered into the system manually or through data<br>
input files.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 is shown<br>
residing in computer systems 5,6, 16 or 18. These computer systems 5,6, 16 or 18<br>
generally comprises a processor 21 and memory 22 (e.g., RAM, ROM, hard disk, CD-<br>
ROM, etc.) with an operating system 32. The processor 21 accepts code and data<br>
from the memory 31 over the local interface 23, for example, a bus(es). Direction<br>
from the user can be signaled by using input devices, for example but not limited to, a<br>
mouse 24 and a keyboard 25. The actions input and resulting output are displayed on<br>
the display terminal 26 or printer (not shown). An efficiency and cost analysis system<br>
50 can access other computers and resources on a network utilizing modem or<br>
network card 27.<br>
Also shown in FIG. 2 are the processes that comprise the efficiency and cost<br>
analysis system 50. The efficiency and cost analysis system 50 includes the following<br>
processes: create new project process 60, default construction process 80, what-if<br>
construction process 100, load data process 120, run stage by stage process 140,<br>
create customer output process 160, add N-packing sheet process 180, add snout ring<br>
sheet process 200, solve snout ring pressure process 220, create customer summary<br>
process 240, print customer output process 260 and print customer summary process<br>
280 in memory area 22. Databases 33 are also shown to reside in memory area 22.<br>
These components are herein described in further detail with regard to FIGS. 2-15.<br>
The memory area 22 can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic,<br>
magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus,<br>
device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the<br>
memory area 22 include any one or more of the following: an electrical connection<br>
(electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a<br>
random access memory (RAM) (magnetic), a read-only memory (ROM) (magnetic),<br>
an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (magnetic),<br>
an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM)<br>
(optical).<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example of the efficiency and cost<br>
analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The efficiency and cost analysis system 50<br>
provides the ability to each engineer to visit a customer steam-turbine power<br>
generation system to examine the steam turbines and recommend maintenance and<br>
replacement of parts and ways of improving the overall unit efficiency and cost of<br>
operation. The efficiency and cost analysis system 50 provides a performance<br>
engineer with the ability to perform data entry and compute efficiency and cost<br>
analysis of the steam turbine operation in a system that leads the performance<br>
engineer through the analysis process. First, the performance engineer creates a new<br>
project using the creates a new project process 60. The creates a new project process<br>
60 enables the user to define the site variables of the steam turbine to be analyzed by<br>
the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The create a new project<br>
process 60 is herein defined in further detail with regard to FIG. 4.<br>
Next, the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 performs the default<br>
construction process 80. This operation results in the construction of the interface to<br>
load the design parameters of the steam-turbine unit to be processed by the efficiency<br>
and cost analysis system 50. This operation also constructs the interface to collect<br>
data for the current condition and the condition of the steam-turbine unit after the<br>
proposed maintenance has been performed. The required input contains the values<br>
that are most likely to require a change from the default parameters. The default<br>
construction process 80 is herein defined in further detail with regard to FIG. 5.<br>
The what-if construction process 100 is next performed. This step is<br>
performed if more than one combination of maintenance recommendations will be<br>
reported. The what-if construction process constructs the interface to collect<br>
additional data that are the most likely values that require a change from the original<br>
value specified in the default construction process for the additional maintenance<br>
configuration. The what-if construction process 100 is herein defined in further detail<br>
with regard to FIG. 6.<br>
Next, the load data operation process 120 is performed. The load data process<br>
120 loads the data for the design parameters of the steam-turbine unit. The load data<br>
process 120 allows the user to enter data that describes the current steam-turbine unit<br>
condition and the expected steam-turbine unit condition after repairs and<br>
maintenance. The load data operation process 120 is herein defined in further detail<br>
with regard to FIG. 7. Later, the run stage by stage process 140 is performed. This<br>
process generates the stage by stage input file for the selected group and selected<br>
stage data. The stage by stage process 140 is herein defined in further detail with<br>
regard to FIG. 8.<br>
Next, the create customer output process 160 is performed. The create<br>
customer output process 160 allows the user to identify the states and sections of the<br>
steam-turbine unit to be compared. The create customer output process 160 is herein<br>
defined in further detail with regard to FIG. 9. Then, the add N-packing sheet process<br>
180 is performed. The add N-packing sheet process 180 enables the user to identify<br>
the number of N-packings to be analyzed and provide input data for the selected<br>
number of N-packings. The add N-packing sheet process 180 is herein defined in<br>
further detail with regard to FIG. 10.<br>
Next, the add snout ring process 200 is performed. The add snout ring process<br>
200 allows the user to specify the number of snout ring valves and the maximum<br>
number of rings per valve, and input data for each valve specified. The add snout ring<br>
process 200 is herein defined in further detail with regard to FIG. 11. The solve snout<br>
ring pressure process 220 is then performed and computes the optimized intermediate<br>
pressures between each ring for each valve. The solve snout ring pressure process<br>
220 is herein described in further detail with regard to FIG. 12.<br>
The create customer summary process 240 enables the user to select the<br>
sections to be included in the customer summary output. The create customer<br>
summary process 240 is herein defined in further detail with regard to FIG. 13. The<br>
print customer output 260 provide the means for the user to select the comparison<br>
report and output printer, and select if an electronic version of the comparison report<br>
is to be created. The print customer output process 260 is herein defined in further<br>
detail with regard to FIG. 14. The final process performed by the efficiency and cost<br>
analysis system 50 is print customer summary process 280. The print customer<br>
summary process 280 allows the user to select the comparison summary report and<br>
printer for output and to indicate if an electronic version of the comparison summary<br>
report is to be created. The print customer summary process 280 is herein defined in<br>
further detail with regard to FIG. 15.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example of the create new project<br>
process 60 that can be utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this<br>
disclosure. The create new project process 60 is first initialized at step 61. This<br>
creates a new project file. At step 62, the create new project process 60 retrieves the<br>
list of site variables and adds them to the project file, so that the user may enter these<br>
associated values later at step 64. The create new project process 60 also constructs<br>
the base section data sheet at step 62. At step 63, the create new project process 60<br>
copies the section variables and comments which describe each variable into the<br>
project file. The create new project process 60 also copies the list of output variables<br>
required to calculate the impact on overall and section efficiency at step 63. The<br>
output variables contain a list of the stage by stage output variables that will be<br>
extracted and stored in resulting work groups. The output variables also contain some<br>
results that apply to the entire section referred to as overall variables. Each variable<br>
indicates whether the values are stage specific or overall variables. The user may add<br>
additional variables to this work group before running the stage by stage process 140<br>
herein defined with regard to FIG. 8, to retrieve additional values for the current<br>
project.<br>
Next, the user is prompted to input site variables at step 64. These site<br>
variables include, but are not limited to, customer name and customer ID, fuel cost,<br>
overall parameters including turbine number, turbine kilowatt output, figure plant<br>
heat rate, capacity factor, cost factors, number of N-packing, number of valves, the<br>
max number of snout rings per valve, and the like.<br>
Next, at step 65, the user is asked to define each section by name. At step 66,<br>
the create new project process 60 creates a column for section data variables for each<br>
section name that the user has defined. The section data variables include the first<br>
and last stage numbers that must be completed before constructing the base variables.<br>
The base section variables are the design values for a steam-turbine power generation<br>
unit. The base section variables include, but not limited to, rotations per minute,<br>
section bowl pressure, section bowl temperature, section bowl enthalpy, section<br>
exhaust pressure, section exhaust temperature, section exhaust enthalpy.<br>
The stage numbers do not need to be unique between groups, so if two groups<br>
represent two flows for the same section, the numbers may be repeated. These<br>
numbers are input at step 67, which allows input of the section data variables. Other<br>
variables may be input by the user at this stage, or indicated if they will be loaded by<br>
reading a stage by stage input file from another source.<br>
At step 68, the create new project process 60 determines whether there are<br>
more groups to be constructed. If there are more groups to be constructed, the create<br>
new project process 60 returns to repeat step 63 through 68. If there are no more<br>
groups to be constructed, the create new project process exits at step 69.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 5 is the default construction process 80 that can be utilized<br>
in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. First the default<br>
construction process 80 is initialized at step 81. Next, at step 82, the default<br>
construction process 80 constructs the base stage data work sheet using the section<br>
data variables defined in the create new project process 60 (FIG. 4). At step 82, the<br>
default construction process 80 also copies the input data parameters for all variables<br>
used in the analysis process to the base stage data work sheet, and then constructs a<br>
separate column for each stage in each group where the data for the variables may be<br>
entered by the user. The base stage data variables include, but are not limited to, stage<br>
flow, carryover type, stage type, nozzle parameters, bucket parameters, clearances<br>
and wheel hole parameters.<br>
Next, in step 83, the default construction process 80 constructs the open<br>
section data worksheet using base section data variables. These base section data<br>
variables include the section variables most likely to differ from the design values of<br>
the device being analyzed by the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of the present<br>
invention. The open section data variables most likely to differ from the design state<br>
include, but are not limited to section group pressure, section group temperature,<br>
section group enthalpy, section exhaust pressure, section exhaust temperature, section<br>
exhaust enthalpy. At step 84, the default construction process 80 constructs the open<br>
stage data work sheet using section data variables, and copies the variables most<br>
likely to differ from the design value of the device being measured. The open stage<br>
data variables are the current variable values for a stage of the steam-turbine power<br>
generation unit. The open stage data variables most likely to differ from the design<br>
state include, but are not limited to, clearances, stage flow and correction factors for<br>
damage to nozzles and buckets.<br>
The default construction process 80 also constructs a separate column for each<br>
stage in each group where the data for these variables may be entered by the user at<br>
step 84. Next, the default construction process 80 constructs the closed section data<br>
work sheet using base section data variables at step 85. These closed section data<br>
variables also include the section variables most likely to differ from design values.<br>
The closed section data variables are the optimum target variable values for a steam-<br>
turbine power generation unit. The closed section data variables most likely to differ<br>
from the design state include, but not limited to, section bowl pressure, section bowl<br>
temperature, section bowl enthalpy, section exhaust pressure, section exhaust<br>
temperature, section exhaust enthalpy.<br>
At step 86, the construction of the closed stage data work sheet using the<br>
section data variables is performed. The closed stage data variables are the optimum<br>
target variable values for each stage of the steam-turbine power generation unit. The<br>
closed stage data variables most likely to differ from the design state include, but are<br>
not limited to, clearances, stage flow and correction factors for damage to nozzles and<br>
buckets. At this point, the default construction process 80 also copies the data<br>
variables most likely to differ from the design values, and then constructs a separate<br>
column for each stage in each group where the data for these variables may be entered<br>
by the user. The default construction process 80 then exits at step 89.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 6 is the what-if construction process 100 that can be utilized<br>
in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The what-if<br>
construction process 100 allows the user to include data variables representative of<br>
different target conditions (i.e. alternative target condition values) for comparison<br>
with the base condition data (i.e. design condition values), open condition data (i.e.<br>
current condition values), and close condition data (i.e. target condition values)<br>
variables. The first step of the what-if construction process 100 is the initialization at<br>
step 101. Next, the what-if construction process 100 prompts the user to input the<br>
name of the what-if work sheet at step 102. At step 103 the what-if construction<br>
process 100 creates a new section data work sheet copying the section variables into<br>
the work sheet that are most likely to differ. The what-if section data variables<br>
include, but are not limited to, any of the variable defined in the open or closed<br>
section data variables configurations. At step 104, a new stage data work sheet is<br>
constructed using base section data variables copying the what-if stage variables into<br>
the work sheet. The what-if stage data variables include, but are not limited to, any of<br>
the variable defined in the open or closed stage data variables configurations. These<br>
what-if section data variables include variables that are most likely to differ from the<br>
design values. The what-if construction process 100 then constructs at step 105, a<br>
separate column for each stage in each group where the data for these variables may<br>
bs entered by the user. The what-if construction process 100 then exits at step 109.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 7 is the load data process 120 that can be utilized in the<br>
efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. First the load data process<br>
120 is initialized at step 121. At step 122, the load data process 120 determines<br>
whether a design data file is available. If it is determined at step 122 that a design<br>
data file is not available, the load data process 120 proceeds to step 135 and allows<br>
the user to enter data for the current design state into the base sections and stage data<br>
sheets. After entering the data for the design state at step 135, the load data process<br>
then proceeds to step 137.<br>
If it is determined at step 122 that a design data file is available, the load data<br>
process 120 requests the user to indicate the selected section for input at step 123.<br>
Next, the load data process 120 makes a determination whether the section for input is<br>
indicated at step 124. If a section for input has not been indicated, the load data<br>
process 120 returns to request the selected section for input at step 123. If it is<br>
determined at step 124 that the section for input has been indicated, the load data<br>
process 120 then requests the selected file for input at step 125. At step 126, the load<br>
data process determines if a file was selected at step 125. If a file was not selected for<br>
input at step 125, the load data process 120 returns to repeat step 125.<br>
If it is determined at step 126 that a file was selected, then the load data<br>
process 120 retrieves the selected input file at step 131. At step 132, the load data<br>
process loads the selected input file into columns in a worksheet for the selected base<br>
section and stage data sections. Each variable in the design input file is identified<br>
explicitly or implicity by a tag. These tags are associated with each variable on the<br>
section data sheet for overall input variables and on the stage data sheet for stage<br>
variables. The load data process 120 first processes the overall section variables and<br>
determines the correct row on the base section data sheet for each overall section<br>
variable read from the input file and then places the value from the input file into the<br>
selected row and the column corresponding to the current work group.<br>
At step 133, the load data process 120 then processes each stage in the input<br>
file. The row for each stage variable read is found on the base stage data sheet. The<br>
corresponding value is copied to the selected row and the column associated with the<br>
current stage in the current work group on the base stage data sheet.<br>
At step 137, the load data process 120 allows the user to enter data states that<br>
differ from the design values. After entering data for other states that differ from the<br>
design values, the load data process 120 then exits at step 139.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 8 is the run stage by stage process 140 that can be utilized<br>
in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The run stage by<br>
stage process 140 allows the user to indicate one or more section and state<br>
combinations to be constructed for later analysis. First, the run stage by stage process<br>
140 is initialized at step 141. At step 142, the user is requested to select a section to<br>
be run. The user may select one or more sections (groups). At step 143, the run stage<br>
by stage process 140 determines whether the user has selected the requested section to<br>
be run at step 142. If it is determined that the user has not selected a requested<br>
section to be run, the run stage by stage process 140 returns to repeat step 142.<br>
If it is determined at step 143 that the user has selected a section to be run, the<br>
run stage by stage process 140 then requests the user to select the state to be run at<br>
step 144. The states to select from include, but are not limited to, the base, open,<br>
closed, and all of the what-if condition cases constructed by the user. The user may<br>
select more than one state. At step 145, the run stage by stage process 140 determines<br>
whether a state to be run has been selected or whether more than one state is to be<br>
selected. If it is determined at step 145 that a state has not been selected or if more<br>
states are to be selected, the run stage by stage process 140 returns to repeat step 144.<br>
If at step 145 it is determined that the user has selected a state to be run, the<br>
run stage by stage process then constructs the selected section and state combinations<br>
at step 146, by pairing every section selected with every state selected and selects the<br>
first combination.<br>
At step 151, it is determined whether there are more section-state<br>
combinations to process in the stage by stage analysis. If it is determined at step 151<br>
that there are no more section-state combinations to be run, the run stage by stage<br>
process 140 then exits at step 159.<br>
If it is determined that there are more section-state combinations to be created,<br>
the run stage by stage process 140 then constructs the new stage by stage analysis<br>
input file or the current section state combination, at step 152. The new stage by stage<br>
analysis file is constructed by using data from the selected state section and stage data<br>
sheet and the base section and stage data sheet for values that are not different. Also<br>
at step 152, the run stage by stage process 140 first constructs the overall section<br>
variable section of the stage by stage analysis file by writing the tag for each non-<br>
blank variable followed by the value in the base section data sheet. Then if the<br>
current state is not the base state, and the variable is not blank on the current state<br>
section data worksheet, the tag is written to the analysis input file followed by the<br>
new value. This allows the stage by stage process 140 to override the value with the<br>
last value read from the analysis input file. Still at step 152, the run stage by stage<br>
process 140 then constructs the data input for each stage by writing the tags for each<br>
non-blank variable from the base stage data sheet followed by the value of the<br>
variable for the current section. Similarly, if the current state is not the base stage, and<br>
the variable is not blank on the current state stage data work sheet, the tag is written to<br>
the analysis input file followed by the new value.<br>
The run stage by stage process 140 then processes the new input file at step<br>
153. The stage by stage analysis output file is also processed to read the output<br>
variables (identified in Fig 4) and store the output data in a new work sheet. The next<br>
section-state combination is selected. The run stage by stage process 140 then returns<br>
to repeat step 151.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 9 is the create customer output process 160 that can be<br>
utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The create<br>
customer output process 160 allows the user to select one or more comparison<br>
operations. In this particular instance, the comparisons made include, but are not<br>
limited to, section efficiency loss, unit kilowatt loss, heat rate loss and the cost of fuel<br>
due to the loss. In this example, these losses may be calculated for, but are not<br>
limited to, the nozzle, bucket, tip, root and shaft leakages, as well as other causes.<br>
The create customer output process 160 is started by being initialized at step<br>
161. At step 162, the create customer output process 160 requests the user to indicate<br>
the states to be compared. It is determined at step 163 whether the states to be<br>
compared have been selected. If it is determined at step 163 that the states to be<br>
compared have not been selected, the create customer output process 160 returns to<br>
repeat 162.<br>
If it is determined at step 163 that the requested states to be compared were<br>
selected, the create customer output process 160 then requests the user to select the<br>
sections to be compared at step 164. It is determined at step 165 whether the<br>
requested sections to be compared were selected. If it is determined at step 165 that<br>
the sections to be compared were not selected, the create customer output process 160<br>
returns to repeat step 164. If it is determined at step 165 that the sections to be<br>
compared were selected, the create customer output process 160 then constructs the<br>
state comparison section combinations at step 166.<br>
At step 171, the create customer output process 160 determines whether there<br>
are more combinations to be compared. If it is determined at step 171 that there are<br>
no more combinations to be compared, the create customer output process 160 then<br>
exits at step 179.<br>
However, if it is determined at step 171 that there are more combinations to be<br>
compared, the create customer output process 160 then performs the indicated<br>
comparisons at step 172. The create customer output process 160 compares the<br>
output results from the two comparison states (e.g. base and close) for the selected<br>
section. The difference between the first and second states are calculated for selected<br>
output variables for each stage which measure performance. Then the values of<br>
interest such as, but not limited to, heat rate loss and the cost of fuel due to the loss,<br>
are calculated from the difference and the overall site variables entered in step 62<br>
(FIG. 4). When all the stages have been calculated, the impact on the entire group<br>
(section) is calculated.<br>
At step 173, the create customer output process 160 constructs the output<br>
reports using the data from the comparison performed at step 172. The output reports<br>
include tables summarizing the performance impact in terms of key values, such as,<br>
but not limited to, percent of section efficiency loss, heat rate loss, cost of fuel due to<br>
the loss for key parts of the section. Cost of fuel due to the loss of key parts includes,<br>
but is not limited to, nozzle, bucket, tip leakage, shaft leakage, root leakage and other<br>
losses. The next state-section combination is selected and the create customer output<br>
process 160 then returns to repeat step 171.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 10 is the add N-packing process 180 that can be utilized in<br>
the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. The add N-packing<br>
process 180 allows the user to define the number of N-packings to analyze and create<br>
requisite input data sheets for the analysis of the N-packings.<br>
First, the add N-packing process 180 is initialized at step 181. At step 182, the<br>
add N-packing process 180 requests the user to select the number of N-packings to be<br>
processed. At step 183, the add N-packing process 180 determines whether a number<br>
• of N-packings has been specified. If it is determined at step 183 that the number of<br>
N-packings has not been specified, the add N-packing process 180 returns to repeat<br>
step 182.<br>
However, if it determined at step 183 that the number of N-packings has been<br>
specified, the add N-packing process 180 creates the N-packing data and calculation<br>
sheets at step 184. At step 185, the add N-packing process 180 starts with the first N-<br>
packing by having the user input the design and measure data into the first N-packing<br>
column on the N-packing data sheet at step 185. Next, it is determined at step 186<br>
whether there are more N-packings to be processed. If it is determined at step 186<br>
that there are no more N-packings to be processed, the add N-packing process 180<br>
proceeds to exit at step 189. However, if it is determined at step 186 that there are<br>
more N-packings to be processed, the add N-packing process 180 then the user inputs<br>
the design and measure data into the next N-packing column on the N-packing data<br>
sheets. The add N-packing process 180 then returns to repeat step 186.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 11 is the add snout ring process 200 that can be utilized in<br>
the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. This process allows the<br>
user to enter data required for calculating the impact of the snout ring clearances on<br>
the flow efficiency. The number of valves and maximum number of allowed rings in<br>
each valve is established.<br>
First, the add snout ring process 200 is initialized at step 201. Also at step<br>
201, the add snout ring process 200 loads the default number of snout ring valves and<br>
maximum number of rings per valve. At step 202, the add snout ring process 200<br>
prompts the user to specify a new number of snout ring valves and maximum rings<br>
per valve. If the user does not specify a new number of snout ring valves and<br>
maximum number of rings per valve at step 202, the add snout ring process 200<br>
utilizes the default number of snout ring valves and maximum number of rings per<br>
valve established during initialization.<br>
At step 203, the add snout ring process 200 creates a new snout ring sheet. The<br>
maximum number of rings per valve defined during step 201 is used to define the row<br>
sections and setup the data on the snout ring sheet. At step 204, the number of rings<br>
for each valve is selected. Any unused ring sections are blacked out to prevent<br>
inadvertent data entry. At step 205 the input valve data for each valve is input. At<br>
step 206, the add snout ring process 200 determines whether there are more snout ring<br>
valves to be processed. If it is determined at step 206 that there are more snout ring<br>
valves to be processed, the add snout ring process 200 returns to repeat step 203<br>
through 206. However, if it determined at step 206 that there no more snout ring<br>
valves to be processed, the add snout ring process 200 then exits at step 209.<br>
Illustrated in FIGs. 12A and 12B is the solve snout ring pressure process 220<br>
that can be utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure.<br>
FIG. 12A illustrates an example of the higher level solve snout ring pressure process<br>
220 and FIG. 12B illustrates an example of the calculate intermediate pressures<br>
routine utilized in the solve snout ring pressure process 220. First, the solve snout<br>
pressure process 220 initializes at step 221. At step 222, the solve snout ring pressure<br>
process 220 gets the data for the first/next valves to be processed.<br>
At step 223, the solve snout ring pressure process 220 then runs the calculate<br>
intermediate pressure routine 230 to calculate and optimize the intermediate<br>
pressures. The calculate intermediate pressures routine 230 is herein described in<br>
further detail with regard to FIG. 12B.<br>
After running the calculate intermediate pressures routine 230, the solve snout<br>
ring pressure process 220 then determines whether there are more valves to be<br>
processed at step 224. If it is determined at step 224 that there are more valves to be<br>
processed, the solve snout ring pressure process 220 gets the data for the next valve at<br>
step 225 and returns to repeat step 223.<br>
If it is determined at step 224 that there are no more valves to calculate the<br>
intermediate pressure for in the solve snout ring pressure process 220, the solve snout<br>
ring pressure process 220 then proceeds to determine if any of the previous<br>
optimizations failed at step 226. Optimization failure occurs when the optimization<br>
did not reach a satisfactory conclusion. If it is determined at step 226 that any of the<br>
previous optimizations failed, the solve snout ring pressure process 220 then<br>
identifies all the failed valves and returns to repeat steps 222 through 226 for the<br>
failed valves. However, if it is determined at step 226 that none of the previous<br>
optimizations failed, the solve snout ring pressure process 220 exits at step 229.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 12(B) is the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230.<br>
First, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 determines whether an<br>
intermediate pressure has been assigned at step 231. If it is determined at step 231<br>
that the intermediate pressure was not assigned, the calculate intermediate pressure<br>
routine 230 then calculates the default intermediate pressures at step 234. The<br>
intermediate pressures are calculated using linear interpolation between the starting<br>
and ending pressure values previously input by the user at step 131 (FIG. 7) and<br>
proceeds to step 235.<br>
However, if it is determined at step 231 that an intermediate pressure has been<br>
assigned, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 then determines whether the<br>
previous optimization failed at step 232. If it is determined at step 232 that the<br>
previous optimization did not fail, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230<br>
then proceeds to step 235. However, if it is determined at step 232 that the previous<br>
optimization did fail, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 then prompts the<br>
user to manually vary the intermediate pressures to provide a new starting point for<br>
the optimization process at step 233.<br>
At step 235, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 calculates the flow<br>
rate between the current rings. Next, at step 236 it is determined whether the<br>
difference between the maximum and minimum calculated flow rate between the<br>
rings is greater than the threshold. If it is determined at step 236 that the difference in<br>
flow is not greater than the threshold, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230<br>
then returns to step 224 (FIG. 12A).<br>
However, if it is determined at step 236 that the calculated flow rate is greater<br>
than the threshold, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 then modifies the<br>
intermediate pressures utilizing any well-known optimization technique to minimize<br>
the difference in flow rates calculated from the pressures at step 237. Next, at step<br>
238, the calculate intermediate pressure routine 230 determines whether the current<br>
optimization iteration has failed to find a solution with the difference less than the<br>
given threshold within a predetermined iteration limit at step 238. If the optimization<br>
has not failed, the calculate intermediate pressures routine 230 increases the number<br>
of optimization iterations and then returns to repeat step 235. If it is determined at<br>
step 238 that the optimization iteration did fail, the calculate intermediate pressures<br>
routine 230 then highlights the failed solution at step 239 and returns to step 224<br>
(FIG. 12 A).<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 13 is the create customer summary process 240 that can be<br>
utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. First, the<br>
create customer summary process 240 is initialized at step 241. Next, the cover and<br>
other sheets which summarize the N-Packing and Snout Ring results are created at<br>
step 242. At step 243, the create customer summary process 240 prompts the user to<br>
select the sections to be included in the summary. At step 244, the create customer<br>
summary process 240 determines whether the sections to be included in the summary<br>
have been selected. If it is determined at step 244 that the sections to be included in<br>
the summary have not been selected, the create customer summary process 240 then<br>
returns to repeat step 243.<br>
However, if it is determined at step 244 that the sections to be included in the<br>
summary have been selected, the create customer summary process 240 then allows<br>
the user to identify which sheets represent the open and close conditions. Normally,<br>
these will default to the open and close conditions, but the user may select other<br>
conditions if they have performed what-if analysis (particularly to represent<br>
alternative closing conditions as a result of different maintenance operations<br>
performed). Next, at step 246, a customer summary report is created for all stages for<br>
each section selected by selecting the totals from the comparison sheets for the<br>
section and conditions and copying them to the Summary Sheet.<br>
The create customer summary process 240 then determines whether the N-<br>
packings are defined at step 251. The N-Packings are not defined if the user has not<br>
constructed the N-Packing sheet through performing the add N-Packing sheet process<br>
180 (Fig. 10). If it is determined at step 251 that the N-packings are not defined, the<br>
create customer summary process 240 then skips to step 253. However, if it is<br>
determined at step 251 that the N-packings are defined, the create customer summary<br>
process 240 then calculates the N-packing packing summary at step 252 by selecting<br>
the calculated impact on efficiency from the N-Packing sheet for each N-Packing<br>
(column) defined. The total impact for N-Packings is then summed and copied to the<br>
Summary Sheet.<br>
At step 253, the create customer summary process 240 then determines<br>
whether the snout rings are defined. If the snout rings are not defined, the create<br>
customer summary process 240 then proceeds to exit at step 259. The Snout Rings are<br>
not defined if the user has not constructed the Snout Ring sheet through create snout<br>
ring sheet process 200 (Fig. 11) and solve snout ring pressure process 220 in (Fig.<br>
12). However, if it is determined at step 253 that the snout rings are defined, the<br>
create customer summary process 240 then calculates the snout ring summaries at<br>
step 254 by selecting the calculated impact on efficiency from the Snout Ring sheet<br>
for each valve defined. The total impact from the Snout Rings is summed and copied<br>
to the Summary Sheet. The create customer summary process 240 then exits at step<br>
259.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 14 is the print customer output process 260 that can be<br>
utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. First, the<br>
print customer output process 260 is initialized at step 261. At step 262, the print<br>
customer output process 260 prompts the user the select the comparison report for<br>
output. At step 263 and 264, the print customer output process 260 prompts the user<br>
to select the printer and the colors for the comparison report. The user selects the<br>
option for color, or black and white printing for the comparison report to be output.<br>
At step 265, the print customer output process 260 sends a comparison report to the<br>
printer selected at step 263.<br>
At step 266, it is determined whether the user wishes to create an electronic<br>
version of the comparison report. If it is determined that the user does not wish to<br>
create an electronic version of the comparison report, the print customer output<br>
process 260 then skips to step 268 to determine whether there are more comparison<br>
reports to be output. However, if it is determined at step 266 that the user wishes to<br>
create an electronic version of the comparison report, the print customer output<br>
process 260 creates and saves an electronic version of the comparison report to an<br>
indicated destination at step 267.<br>
At step 268, the print customer output process 260 determines whether there<br>
are more comparison reports to be output. If it is determined at step 268 that there are<br>
more comparison reports to be output, the print customer output process 260 returns<br>
to repeat steps 262 through 268. However, if it is determined at step 268 that there<br>
are no more comparison reports to be output, the print customer output process 260<br>
then exits at step 269.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 15 is a print customer summary process 280 that can be<br>
utilized in the efficiency and cost analysis system 50 of this disclosure. First, the<br>
print customer summary process 280 is initialized at step 281. At step 282 and 283,<br>
the user is prompted to select the printer and the colors that the comparison summary<br>
report is to be output. At step 284, the print customer summary process 280 then<br>
sends the comparison summary report to the selected printer.<br>
At step 285, it is determined whether the user wishes to create an electronic<br>
version of the comparison summary report. If it is determined that the user does not<br>
wish to create an electronic version of the comparison summary report, the print<br>
customer summary process 280 then exits at step 289. However, if it is determined at<br>
step 285 that the user does wish to create an electronic version of the comparison<br>
summary report, the print customer summary process 280 creates and saves the<br>
electronic version of the comparison summary report to an indicated location at step<br>
286. The print customer summary process 280 then exits at step 289.<br>
The efficiency and cost analysis system and method 50 comprises an ordered<br>
listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. The ordered<br>
listing can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection<br>
with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based<br>
system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions<br>
from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, and execute the<br>
instructions. In the context of this document, a "computer-readable medium" can be<br>
any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program<br>
for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or<br>
device.<br>
The computer readable medium can be, for example, but not limited to, an<br>
electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system,<br>
apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive<br>

(magnetic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory)<br>
(magnetic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory<br>
(CDROM) (optical).<br>
Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another<br>
suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be<br>
electronically captured via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other<br>
medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if<br>
necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.<br>

unit (7);<br>
