"AN ENGINE FOR A MOTOR VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1 Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
8 SEP 2006<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to an engine for a motor vehicle.<br>
The present invention relates to an engine for a motorcycle,.and more particularly to an engine for a motorcycle having a erankcase, a cylinder block extending upwardly and forwardly of a motor vehicle from an upper portion of the front end of the erankcase, and a cylinder head joined to the upper end of the cylinder block, the erankcase housing and supporting a crankshaft, a transmission input shaft, and a transmission output shaft which are arranged to have their axes oriented transversely of the motor vehicle.  The. transmission input shaft is offset upwardly with respect to a plane which includes the axes of the crankshaft and the transmission output shaft.<br>
[0.002]<br>
[Prior art]<br>
is<br>
Conventional engines for motorcycles generally' have a cylinder block arranged to. have its axis extending<br><br><br>
across the axis of the crankshaft (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-29085).<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In such engines for motorcycles, offsetting a transmission input shaft upwardly with respect to a plane which includes the axes of a crankshaft and a transmission output shaft is effective to reduce the interaxial distance between the crankshaft and the transmission output shaft thereby to shorten the overall length of the engine in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle for making the engine compact.  However, the conventional engines fail to provide a sufficient upward offset of the transmission input shaft because of the cylinder block which is positioned in the way.  One solution would be to reduce the angle through which the cylinder block rises from the horizontal plane in order to provide a sufficient upward offset of the transmission input shaft.  However, since the front end of the cylinder head would be shifted forwardly, there would be an increase in the overall length of the engine in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle, canceling out the reduction in the overall length of the engine in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle, which is<br><br><br>
provided by the increased upward offset of the transmission input shaft.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks.  It is an object of the present invention to provide an engine for motorcycles which has a transmission input shaft of which the upward offset is sufficiently increased without being obstructed by the cylinder block to effectively reduce the overall length of the engine in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided in accordance with a first feature of the present invention an engine for a motorcycle having a crankcase, a cylinder block extending upwardly and forwardly of a motor vehicle from an upper portion of the front end of the crankcase, and a cylinder head joined to the upper end of the cylinder block, the crankcase housing and supporting a crankshaft, a transmission input shaft, and a transmission output shaft which are arranged to have their axes oriented transversely of the motor vehicle, the transmission input shaft being offset upwardly with<br><br><br>
respect to a plane which includes the axes of the crankshaft and the transmission output shaft, characterized in that the cylinder block is disposed to have its axis passing forwardly of the axis of the crankshaft.<br>
According to the above first feature, with the cylinder block being disposed to have its axis passing forwardly of the axis of the crankshaft, if the angle through which the axis of the cylinder block rises from the horizontal plane is increased, then a free upper area of the crankcase which is not obstructed by the cylinder block is widened without changing the position of the front end of the engine.  Therefore, the upward offset of the input shaft with respect to the horizontal plane can be sufficiently increased without being obstructed by the cylinder block, thus effectively shortening the interaxial distance between the crankshaft and the output shaft. As a result, the size of the crankcase in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle is made compact, thus reducing the overall length of the engine in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle for thereby effectively making the engine compact.<br>
[0007]<br><br><br>
The offset of the axis of the cylinder block with<br>
respect to the axis of the crankshaft causes a reduction<br>
in the angle of inclination of the connecting rod under a<br>
maximum pressure in the expansion stroke of the engine.<br>
As a result, a side thrust which the piston receives from<br>
the inner surface of the cylinder bore is reduced,<br>
reducing the frictional resistance to the sliding motion<br>
of the piston, which contributes to lower fuel<br>
consumption.<br>
- [0008]	<br>
According to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the cylinder block is disposed substantially parallel to a downward portion of a down tube of a vehicle frame. ..[0009]—<br>
According to the second feature, the dead space between the down tube and the cylinder head is minimized to reduce the wheelbase of the motorcycle.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to a third feature of the present invention, in addition to the first and second features, a breather chamber communicating with the interior of the crankcase is mounted on a portion of the crankcase near a rear surface of the cylinder block.<br><br><br>
According to the third feature, the dead space present between the cylinder block and the input shaft in the crankcase is effectively utilized to form the breather chamber, further making the engine conpact.<br>
The present invention relates to an engine for a motor vehicle, comprising: a crankcase; a cylinder block, said cylinder block being positionable to extend upwardly and forwardly of the motor vehicle from an upper portion of a front end of said crankcase; and a cylinder head, said cylinder head being joined to an upper end of said cylinder block, wherein said crankcase houses and supports a crankshaft, a transmission input shaft, and a transmission output shaft arrangeable to have respective axes thereof oriented transversely of the motor vehicle; said transmission input shaft is offset upwardly with respect to a plane including the axes of said crankshaft and said transmission output shaft, and said cylinder block is disposed to have an axis thereof passing forwardly of the axis of said crankshaft wherein the transmission input shaft is arranged upside of said crankshaft and said transmission output shaft is arranged downside of said crankshaft.<br><br><br>

The terms "front" , "rear", " 1ongitudinal"left" "right", and "transverse" used in the description refer to directions with respect to a motorcycle M to which the present invention is applied.<br><br><br>
A first embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 will first be described below.  In FIG. 1, a motorcycle M has a vehicle frame F including a head pipe 1, a main tube 2 welded to an upper portion of the head pipe 1 and extending rearwardly and downwardly at a low gradient, and a down tube 3 welded to a lower portion of the head pipe 1.  The down tube 3 includes a downward portion 3a extending downwardly from the head pipe 1, and a horizontal portion 3b bent rearwardly from the lower end of the downward portion 3a.  A central tube 4 extending downwardly from an intermediate portion of the main tube 2 is connected to the rear end of the horizontal portion 3b.  A stay 5 is connected between the main tube 2 and the down tube 3 in the vicinity of the head pipe 1.  An engine E supported by the down tube 3 and the stay 5 is disposed in a space which is surrounded by the main tube 2, the down tube 3, the stay 5, and the central tube 4. <br>
A front fork 7 on which a front wheel 6f is rotatably supported is steerably pivotally supported on the head pipe 1. A rear fork 8 on which a rear wheel 6r is supported is pivotally supported on the rear end of<br><br><br>
the down tube 3 through a pivot shaft 9.  A rear cushion 10 is connected between the rear fork 8 and the main tube 2 . <br>
A fuel tank 11 and a saddle 12 are disposed on the main tube 2.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the engine E has an engine body 20 including a crankcase 21, a cylinder block 22 coupled to an upper portion of the front end of the crankcase 21 and projecting upwardly and forwardly therefrom, and a cylinder head 23 joined to the upper end of the cylinder block 22.<br>
A crankshaft 28 housed in the crankcase 21 is supported on the left and right side walls of the crankcase 21 by bearings 27, 27'.  A piston 29 slidingly movable in a single cylinder bore 22a in the cylinder block 22 is connected to the crankshaft 28 by a connecting rod 30. <br>
The cylinder head 23 has a combustion chamber 31 faced by the top surface of the piston 29, an intake port 32 communicating with the combustion chamber 31 and<br><br>
opening at a rear surface of the cylinder head 23, and an exhaust port 33 communicating with the combustion chamber 31 and opening at a front surface of the cylinder head 23. An intake valve 34 and an exhaust valve 35 for opening and closing the intake port 32 and the exhaust port 33, respectively, are mounted in the cylinder head 23.  The intake valve 34 and the exhaust valve 35 are operated by a valve operating mechanism 36 which is disposed in a valve operating chamber 37 in the cylinder head 23. <br>
The valve operating mechanism 36 includes a camshaft 38 rotatably supported on the cylinder head 23 by a pair of left and right bearings 39, 39' parallel to the crankshaft 28 in a position intermediate between the intake and exhaust valves 34, 35, an intake rocker arm 40 pivotally supported on the cylinder head 23 and operatively interconnecting the camshaft 38 and the intake valve 34, an exhaust rocker arm 41 pivotally supported on the cylinder head 23 and operatively interconnecting the camshaft 38 and the exhaust valve 35, and valve springs 42, 43 for normally biasing the intake and exhaust valves 34, 35, respectively, in a valve closing direction. <br><br><br>
The camshaft 38 is operatively coupled to the crankshaft 28 by a timing transmission device 51.  The timing transmission device 51 includes a drive sprocket 52 fixed to the crankshaft 28 disposed outwardly of and adjacent to the left bearing 27 which supports the crankshaft 28, a driven sprocket 53 fixed to an end of the camshaft 38, and an endless timing chain 54 trained around the sprockets 52, 53.  The timing transmission device 51 is capable of transmitting rotation of the crankshaft 28 to the camshaft 38 at a speed reduction ratio of 1/2.  The timing chain 54 is disposed in a timing chain passage 55 that is defined in a side wall of the cylinder block 22. <br>
A carburetor 13 (see FIG. 1) connected to the intake port 32 is connected to the rear surface of the cylinder head 23.  An exhaust pipe 14 (see also FIG. 1) connected to the exhaust port 33 is connected to the front surface of the cylinder head 23, and a muffler 15 is connected to the rear end of the exhaust pipe 14. <br>
The cylinder block 22 is disposed such that the cylinder bore 22a has its axis Ab is offset forwardly a distance e with respect to an axis Ac of the crankshaft<br><br><br>
28.  With the front end of the cylinder head 23 being positioned as closely to the downward portion 3a of the down tube 3 as possible in the same manner as the conventional engine, the axis Ab of the cylinder block 22 rises from the horizontal plane through a relatively<br>
sharp angle 0.  Preferably, the cylinder block 22 is arranged to extend parallel to the downward portion 3a of the down tube 3.<br>
A breather chamber 57 is defined in a portion of the crankcase 21 close to the rear surface of the cylinder block 22.  The breather chamber 57 has an inlet 57a communicating with the interior of the crankcase 21 and an outlet 57b communicating with an intake system including the carburetor 13 through a breather pipe 59. The interior of the breather chamber 57 is constructed as a labyrinth between the inlet 57a and the outlet 57b for separating a lubricating oil from a blow-by gas produced in the crankcase 21 while the blow-by gas is passing through the breather chamber 57. <br>
A generator 60 has a rotor 61 keyed to one end of the crankshaft 28.  The rotor 61 is connected to a starter gear 62 which is rotatably supported on the crankshaft 28<br><br>
by a one-way clutch 63.  The one-way clutch 63 transmits rotational forces from the starter gear 62 to the rotor 61 in one direction only.  The starter gear 62 is rotated through a speed reduction gear train by a starter motor 65 which is mounted on a front portion of the crankcase 21 below the cylinder block 22.<br><br>
The crankcase 21 accommodates a transmission 70 having an input shaft 71 and an output shaft 72 which extend parallel to the crankshaft 28.  The input and output shafts 71, 72 are supported on the opposite side walls of the crankcase 21 by respective pairs of bearings 73, 73' and 74, 74'.  Transmission gear trains 75x through 75n is interposed between the input and output shafts 71, 72.  Power generated by the crankshaft 28 is transmitted through a centrifugal clutch 76, a primary speed reduction gear train 77, and a transmission clutch 78 to the input shaft 71, and then transmitted from the input shaft 71 through a selected transmission gear train to the output shaft 72, from which the power is transmitted through a chain transmitting device 79 (see FIG. 1) disposed outside of the crankcase 21 to the rear wheel 6r, thus rotating the rear wheel 6r.<br><br><br>
In the transmission 70, the input shaft 71 is disposed such that its axis Ai is offset upwardly a distance s with respect to a plane P which includes the axes Ac, Ao of the crankshaft 28 and the output shaft 72 at a position intermediate between the crankshaft 28 and the output shaft 72.<br>
Operation of the above embodiment will be described below. <br>
FIG. 2 shows the outline of a conventional engine E' as indicated by the chain lines.  A comparison between the outlines of the engine E according to the present invention and the conventional engine E' shows that with the front end of the cylinder head 23 being positioned as closely to the downward portion 3a of the down tube 3 as possible, the cylinder block 22 is arranged such that the angle 0 through which the axis Ab of the cylinder block 22 rises from the horizontal plane is greater than the<br>
conventional angle 0' and the axis Ab of the cylinder block 22 passes forwardly of the axis Ac of the crankshaft 28.  Therefore, a free upper area of the crankcase 21 which is not obstructed by the cylinder block 22 is widened without changing the position of the<br><br><br>
front end of the engine E.  Therefore, the upward offset s of the input shaft 71 with respect to the horizontal plane P can be sufficiently made greater than the conventional offset s' without being obstructed by the cylinder block 22, thus effectively making the interaxial distance L1 between the crankshaft 28 and the output shaft 72 much smaller than the conventional interaxial distance L1' .  As a result, the size of the crankcase 21 in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle is made compact, thus greatly reducing the overall length L2 of the engine E in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle so as to be smaller than the conventional overall length L2' for thereby effectively making the engine E compact. Particularly, if the cylinder block 22 is parallel to the downward portion 3a of the down tube 3 of the vehicle frame F, the dead space between the downward portion 3a and the cylinder head 23 is minimized for thereby reducing the wheelbase of the motorcycle M.<br><br>
The offset of the axis Ab of the cylinder bore 22a with respect to the axis Ac of the crankshaft 28 causes a reduction in the angle of inclination of the connecting rod 30 under a maximum pressure in the expansion stroke of the engine E.  As a result, a side thrust which the<br><br><br>
piston 29 receives from the inner surface of the cylinder bore 22a is reduced, reducing the frictional resistance to the sliding motion of the piston 29, which contributes to lower fuel consumption. <br>
Since the breather chamber 57 is defined in the portion of the crankcase 21 close to the rear surface of the cylinder block 22, the dead space between the cylinder block 22 and the input shaft 71 in the crankcase 21 is effectively utilized to form the breather chamber 57, further making the engine E compact.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 4 will be described below.<br><br>
According to the present invention, the present invention is applied to a V-shaped engine E having a front bank Bf and a rear bank Br.  The front bank Bf corresponds to the cylinder block 22 and the cylinder head 23 according to the first embodiment.  The rear bank Br is arranged such that the axis Ab of the cylinder block 22 thereof is offset forwardly a distance e with respect to the axis Ac of the crankshaft 28 in order to avoid interference with the transmission 70.  In the<br><br><br>
illustrated embodiment, the forward offset of the cylinder block axis Ab from the crankshaft axis Ac of the front bank Bf and the forward offset of the cylinder block axis Ab from the crankshaft axis Ac of the rear bank Br are set to equal distances e.  However, these offsets may be set to different distances.<br><br>
Other structural details of the second embodiment are identical to those of the first embodiment.  Therefore, those parts of the second embodiment which correspond to those of the first embodiment are denoted by identical reference characters, and will not be described in detail below. <br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, but may be modified in design without departing from the scope thereof. [Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the first feature of the present invention, as described above, there is provided an engine for a motorcycle having a crankcase, a cylinder block extending upwardly and forwardly of a motor vehicle from an upper portion of the front end of the crankcase,<br><br><br>
and a cylinder head joined to the upper end of the cylinder block, the crankcase housing and supporting a crankshaft, a transmission input shaft, and a transmission output shaft which are arranged to have their axes oriented transversely of the motor vehicle, the transmission input shaft being offset upwardly with respect to a plane which includes the axes of the crankshaft and the transmission output shaft, characterized in that the cylinder block is disposed to have its axis passing forwardly of the axis of the crankshaft.  Therefore, with the cylinder block being disposed to have its axis passing forwardly of the axis of the crankshaft, the angle through which the axis of the cylinder block rises from the horizontal plane is increased, widening a free upper area of the crankcase which is not obstructed by the cylinder block without changing the position of the front end of the engine. Therefore, the upward offset of the input shaft with respect to the horizontal plane can be sufficiently increased without being obstructed by the cylinder block, thus effectively making the engine compact in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle.  The offset of the axis of the cylinder block with respect to the axis of the crankshaft causes a reduction in the angle of<br><br>
inclination of the connecting rod under a maximum pressure in the expansion stroke of the engine.  A side thrust which the piston receives from the inner surface of the cylinder bore is reduced, reducing the frictional resistance to the sliding motion of the piston, which contributes to lower fuel consumption. <br>
According to the second feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the cylinder block is disposed substantially parallel to a downward portion of a down tube of a vehicle frame.  Consequently, the dead space between the down tube and the cylinder head is minimized to reduce the wheelbase of the motorcycle. <br>
According to the third feature of the present invention, in addition to the first and second features, a breather chamber communicating with the interior of the crankcase is mounted on a portion of the crankcase near a rear surface of the cylinder block.  Consequently, the dead space present between the cylinder block and the input shaft in the crankcase is effectively utilized to form the breather chamber, further making the engine compact.<br><br>
