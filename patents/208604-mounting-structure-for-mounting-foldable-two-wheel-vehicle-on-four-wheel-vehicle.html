"MOUNTING   STRUCTURE FOR MOUNTING FOLDABLE TWO-WHEEL VEHICLE ON FOUR-WHEEL VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
21-05-2007<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains] The present invention relates to a mounting structure for mounting two-wheel vehicle on four-wheel vehicle in which the containing space "at" the time of mounting a folded two-wheel vehicle on a four-wheel vehicle is reduced, and the two-wheel vehicle can be easily mounted on the four-wheel vehicle. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As a mounting structure on a bicycle side for mounting a foldable two-wheel vehicle on a four-wheel<br>
2<br><br>
vehicle, there has been known, for example, that which is described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 7-228284 "Tricycle".<br>
FIG. 3 in the above-mentioned publication shows a tricycle in the state of being mounted in the vehicle compartment by folding a handle post portion to the rear side, and FIG. 2 in the publication shows a plan view of the tricycle having two front wheels and one rear wheel.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-mentioned tricycle, in the sate of being mounted on the four-wheel vehicle, has a large vehicle width due to the two front wheels, and necessitates a large width of the containing space because the pedals provided at the tip ends of the foot step levers 3 are projected to the left and right. Thus, the object is simply to mount the tricycle on a four-wheel vehicle, and reduction of space is not taken into consideration. Therefore, a large space for exclusive use is required in the vehicle compartment, and it is not easy to mount the folded tricycle onto the four-wheel vehicle.<br>
[0004]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the containing space for the folded<br>
3<br><br>
two-wheel vehicle, to make it possible to mount the two-wheel vehicle on a portion of a four-wheel vehicle which has not been present in the related art, and to enable easy mounting of the two-wheel vehicle onto the four-wheel vehicle, by improving the mounting structure for mounting the foldable two-wheel vehicle on the four-wheel vehicle.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, claim 1 is characterized in that a two-wheel vehicle foldable to a width equal to the width of a license number plate can be contained in a vehicle body component member of a four-wheel vehicle.<br>
[0006]<br>
Since the vehicle width of the two-wheel vehicle is equal to the width of the license number plate, the containing space at the time of mounting the two-wheel vehicle on the four-wheel vehicle can be reduced, the two-wheel vehicle can be mounted on the four-wheel vehicle while sufficiently securing a vehicle compartment space in the four-wheel vehicle, and the operation of mounting the two-wheel vehicle onto the four-wheel vehicle can be easily carried out.<br><br>
                     4<br><br>
[0007]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the foldable two-wheel vehicle has a structure in which a handle post is fitted to a front portion of a vehicle body so as to be foldable in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body, handles are fitted to the handle post so as to be foldable in the vehicle width direction, steps are fitted to lower portions of side portions of the vehicle body so as to be foldable in the vehicle width direction, a front wheel support member for supporting a front wheel is fitted to the vehicle body so as to be swingable to the rear side of the vehicle body, and a rear wheel support member for supporting a rear wheel is fitted to the vehicle body so as to be swingable to the front side of the vehicle body, whereby the foldable two-wheel vehicle is folded into a roughly rectangular parallelopiped form.<br>
[0008]<br>
With the foldable two-wheel vehicle folded into a roughly rectangular parallelopiped form by folding the handle post, the handles, the steps and the front and rear wheels, the containing space for the two-wheel vehicle provided on the four-wheel vehicle side may be roughly rectangular parallelopiped in shape, so that the degree of freedom in designing the containing space can<br><br>
                        5<br><br>
be increased. [0009]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that rearview mirrors are provided at end portions of the handles, and the rearview mirrors are rotatably fitted to the handles so as to have an interval roughly equal to the interval in the vehicle width direction of the handles when the handles are folded.<br>
With the rearview mirrors provided at the end portions of the handles rotatably fitted to the handles, the rearview mirrors which might be projected in the vehicle width direction when the handles are folded can be folded into a more compact form. [0010]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that the vehicle body component member of the four-wheel vehicle is a side wall or a rear wall.<br>
Since the vehicle body component member for containing the two-wheel vehicle is the side wall or rear wall of the four-wheel vehicle, the two-wheel vehicle can be utilized as a strength member for the side wall or rear wall, and, therefore, the four-wheel vehicle can be reduced in weight.  In addition, with the two-wheel vehicle small in width contained in the side wall or rear<br><br>
                          6<br><br>
wall, a collected large vehicle compartment space can be formed as compared, for example, with the case of containing the two-wheel vehicle in a portion of the vehicle compartment, and the vehicle compartment space can be utilized more effectively.<br>
[0011]<br>
Claim 5 is characterized in that the side wall or rear wall of the four-wheel vehicle includes an outer panel member which permits the inside to be seen therethrough.<br>
Since the two-wheel vehicle mounted on the four-wheel vehicle can be visually recognized from the outside, the four-wheel vehicle permitting the folded two-wheel vehicle mounted thereon to be recognized at a glance has a characteristic design, which can enhance the attractiveness of the article of commerce.<br>
[0012]<br>
Claim 6 is characterized in that the vehicle body component member of the four-wheel vehicle is a door.<br>
When, for example, the door is opened and the two-wheel vehicle is contained into the door through an end portion of the door, the operation of mounting the two-wheel vehicle can be easily carried out.<br>
[0013]<br>
7<br><br>
Claim 7 is characterized in that the door includes a rail member which can be drawn out and can be bridgingly set between the ground and the door at the time of mounting the two-wheel vehicle.<br>
By moving the two-wheel vehicle on the rail member, it is possible to easily mount the two-wheel vehicle. [0014!<br>
Claim 8 is characterized in that the rail member has a lifter structuire, and the rail member can be raised and lowered by an electric motor.<br>
The rail member becomes an electric lifter, and the operations of loading and unloading the two-wheel vehicle can be performed more easily. [0015] [Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>

FIG. 19 is a flowchart for illustrating the main points of folding the front and rear wheels of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention.  STXX represent the step number.<br>
ST01:  It is judged whether or not a folding switch (Here, the motor operating switch is referred to as the folding switch in the meaning of using the switch by tilting to the "FOLD" side.) provided on the handle is ON.<br>
When the folding switch is OFF (NO), ST01 is carried out again.<br>
When the folding switch is ON (YES), ST02 is entered. [0071]<br>
ST02:  It is judged whether or not the front brake has been operated by gripping a front brake lever.<br>
When the front brake has not been operated (NO), ST02 is again carried out.<br>
When the front brake has been operated (YES), ST03 is entered. [0072]<br>
ST03:  It is judged whether or not the rear brake lever has been ungripped and the rear brake has not been operated.<br><br>
                            48<br><br>
When the rear brake has been operated (NO), ST02 is again carried out.<br>
When the rear brake has not been operated (YES), ST04 is entered, [0073]<br>
ST04: An electric current is passed to the solenoid to operate the actuator, thereby unlocking the front swing arm and the rear swing arm.<br>
ST05:  It is judged whether or not the lock detection switch of the lock pin for locking the front swing arm and the rear swing arm is OFF (namely, whether or not the front swing arm and the rear swing arm are unlocked).<br>
When the lock detection switch is ON (NO) (namely, when the locked condition is detected), ST05 is again carried out.<br>
When the lock detection switch is OFF (YES) (namely, when the unlocked condition is detected), ST06 is entered. [0074]<br>
ST06: An electric current is passed to the electric motor to rotate the rear wheel forward, thereby starting the folding of the front and rear wheels.<br>
ST07:  It is judged whether or not the lapse of time t from the start of passage of the electric current<br><br>
                        49<br><br>
to the electric motor is shorter than a predetermined period of time tst.<br>
When t &gt; tst (NO) , ST09 is entered. This is for cutting off the passage of electric current so as to protect the motor, because it is judged that the folding is not completed even after the lapse of time normally required for folding, namely, it is judged that there is some trouble.<br>
When t 
ST08:  It is judged whether or not the folding detection switch for the front and rear wheels is ON, namely, whether or not the front and rear wheels have both been completely folded.<br>
When the folding detection switch for the front and rear wheels is OFF (NO), ST07 is again carried out.<br>
When the folding detection switch for the front and rear wheels is ON (YES), ST09 is entered.<br>
ST09: Passage of electric current to the electric motor and the solenoid is stopped. [0076]<br>
Next, the action of folding the front and rear wheels will be described along the flow shown in the flowchart in FIG. 19.<br><br>
                        50<br><br>
First, in FIG. 1, the motor operating switch 24 provided on the right-side handle 18 is tilted to the "FOLD" side. [0077]<br>
Then, when the front brake is operated by gripping the front brake lever (not shown) which will be described later provided on the right-side handle 18, the front lever is locked by the brake lock lever, and a rear brake lever (not shown) provided on the left-side handle 17 is ungripped and therefore the rear brake is not operated, it is detected by a front brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the front brake is operated, whereas it is detected by a rear brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the rear brake is not operated, and a control device (not shown) passes an electric current to the solenoid shown in FIG. 17, thereby operating the actuator 17 8. [0078]<br>
FIGS. 20(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the action of the swing arm unlocking mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
When the actuator 178 (See FIG. 17) is operated, in (a), the arm lock pin 165 is pulled through the wire 168, and is moved as indicated by the arrow, so that the tip<br><br>
                           51<br><br>
end of the arm lock pin 165 is disengaged from the penetration hole 161a of the projected piece 161, and the front swing arm 37 is unlocked.<br>
In (b), when the arm lock pin 165 is disengaged from the penetration hole 161a, the roller of the rollered arm 174c of the lock detection switch 174 comes off from the detection piece 173, so that the lock detection switch 174 is turned OFF. [0079]<br>
FIGS. 21(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the action of folding the front and rear wheels according to the present invention.<br>
In (a) and (b), when the lock detection switch 174 (See FIG. 16(b)) is turned OFF, the control device starts passing an electric current to the electric motor 116, and the rear wheel 12 is driven at a low speed by the electric motor 116.  The rotating direction of the electric motor 116, namely, of the rear wheel 12 at this time is the forward rotation direction (the rotating direction at the time of running, namely, the direction of the arrow). [0080]<br>
By this, the rear wheel 12 moves to the front side of the vehicle body (the direction of the void arrow<br>
52<br><br>
(front) is the front side). At this time, the front wheel 11 is in the braked condition and is not moved to the front side of the vehicle body, so that the distance between the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 is decreased, whereby the front swing arm 37 and the rear swing arm 42 respectively unlocked with reference to the vehicle body are tilted with the front swing shaft 57 and the rear swing shaft 58 as centers, respectively, gradually into folded conditions. [0081]<br>
Then, when the predetermined period of time has elapsed from the start of the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116 or when the front wheel folding detection switch 184 and the rear wheel folding detection switch 186 are both turned ON, the control device stops the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116. By this, the folding of the front and rear wheels 11, 12 is completed. [0082]<br>
Next, the action of unfolding the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 which have been folded will be described below.<br>
FIG. 20 is a flowchart for illustrating the main points of unfolding the front and rear wheels of the two-<br><br>
                         53<br><br>

ST11:  It is judged whether or not an unfolding switch (Here, the motor operating switch is referred to as the unfolding switch in the meaning of using the motor operating switch by tilting to the "UNFOLD" side.) provided on the handle is ON.<br>
When the unfolding switch is OFF (NO), ST11 is again carried out.<br>
When the unfolding switch is ON (YES), ST12 is entered. [0083]<br>
ST12:  It is judged whether or not the front brake has been operated by gripping the front brake lever.<br>
When the front brake has not been operated (NO), ST12 is again carried out.<br>
When the front brake has been operated (YES), ST13 is entered. [0084]<br>
ST13:  It is judged whether or not the rear brake lever has been ungripped and the rear brake has not been operated.<br>
When the rear brake has been operated (NO), ST12 is again carried out.<br>
54<br><br>
When the rear brake has not been operated (YES), ST14 is entered. [0085]<br>
ST14:  It is judged whether or not the lock detection switches on the front swing arm side and on the rear swing arm side are OFF.<br>
When the lock detection switches are ON (NO), ST14 is carried out again.<br>
When the lock detection switches are OFF (YES), ST15 is entered. [0086]<br>
ST15: An electric current is passed to the electric motor to rotate the rear wheel reversely, thereby starting to unfold the front and rear wheels.<br>
ST16:  It is judged whether or not the lapse of time t from the start of passage of electric current to the electric motor is shorter than a predetermined period of time tst.<br>
When t &gt; tst (NO), ST16 is again carried out.<br>
When t 
ST17:  The passage of electric current to the electric motor is stopped. [0087]<br>
The condition of ST14 mentioned above will be<br><br>

[0088]<br>
In (b), with the arm lock pin 165 moved to the most left-side position, the roller of the lock detection switch 174 comes off from the detection piece 173, so that the lock detection switch 174 is turned OFF.<br>
Based on this OFF condition, the control device starts passing an electric current to the electric motor 116, in FIGS. 21(a) and (b), so that the front and rear wheels 11, 12 are unfolded. [0089]<br>
Next, the condition immediately before completion of the unfolding of the front and rear wheels 11, 12 will<br><br>

FIGS. 36 (a) to (c) are action views for illustrating the action of the knob of the handle support mechanism according to the present invention, in which (a) is a sectional view, and (b) and (c) are views of the bar 266 and the handle post 23 from direction A of (a).<br>
In (a), the knob 236 is pushed, whereby the bar 266 is lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c of the handle post 23. [0116]<br>
In (b), with the bar 266 lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 comes to be rotatable. Then, the knob 236 is rotated in the direction of the arrow.  Since the above-mentioned step portions 23d, 23e are present in the direction of the arrow of each of the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 can be rotated without interference with the handle post 23 . [0117]<br>
In (c), the knob 236 is shown as being rotated by<br>
90°  from the position of (b). The bar 266 comes into the condition of being disposed along the cutout portion 23a<br><br>
                            69<br><br>
of the handle post 23, whereby the knob 236 becomes capable of coming out of the cutout portion 23a of the handle post 23 together with the handle clamp lever 237 (See FIG. (a)), namely, the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237 is released by the knob 236. [0118]<br>
FIGS. 37(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the actions of the handle clamp lever and peripheral component parts of the handle support mechanism according to the present invention. While description will be made below based on the constitution on the side of the handle 17, the same action applies also to the side of the handle 18.<br>
In FIGS. 36(a) to (c), the knob 236 is rotated to cancel the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237, and, thereafter, in FIG. 37(a), the handle clamp lever 237 is kicked up in the direction of the arrow with the connection pin 243 as a center. [0119]<br>
Returning to FIG. 33, the distance LI between the first end portion 241a of the handle clamp lever 237 and the axis of the connection pin 243 is greater than the distance L2 between the second end portion 241b and the<br><br>
                             70<br><br>
axis of the connection pin 243, and, therefore, in FIG. 37 (a), a gap with a distance C is generated between the second end portion 241b and the washer 262 by the kick-up of the handle clamp lever 237. [0120]<br>
With the gap with the distance C thus generated, in (b), the handle 17 can be moved in the direction of the arrow together with the nut member 244 and the center bolt 253, and the projected portion 17d of the handle 17 can be disengaged from the recessed portion 263 of the handle post 23, whereby restriction on the rotation of the handle 17 is eliminated, and the handle 17 can be folded. [0121]<br>
FIG. 38 is a front view showing the folded condition of the handles according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the handles 17, 18 are folded to the greatest extent.<br>
Thus, by folding the handles 17, 18, the maximum width WH (The maximum width WH is smaller than the width of the above-mentioned number plate.) of the handles 17, 18 can be made to be very small, as compared with the maximum width of the handles 17, 18 before folding, which is markedly advantageous as to the containing space<br><br>
