				<td>Combinations for the Treatment of Diseases involving Cell Proliferation<br>
The invention relates to new pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diseases involving cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis of cancer cells, or angiogenesis and the preparation thereof. The invention further relates to a method for the treatment of diseases involving cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis of cancer cells, or angiogenesis, which method comprises co-administration to a person in need of such treatment and/or co-treatment of a person in need of such treatment with effective amounts of:<br>
(i)   A compound 1_ of Formula (I) (Figure Remove)<br>
wherein the groups L, R1, R2, R3, R4and R5 have the meanings given in the claims and specification, optionally in form of its tautomers, racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers and the mixtures thereof and optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts, solvates, hydrates, polymorphs, physiologically functional derivatives or prodrugs thereof; and (ii) At least a further chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic or<br>
immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, hormonal or naturally occurring, semi-synthetic or synthetic therapeutic agent 2; and/or<br>
 (iii) Radiotherapy or radio-immunotherapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are serine/ threonine kinases that play important roles in regulating processes in the cell cycle. There are four PLKs disclosed in the state of the art, i.e. PLK-1, PLK-2, PLK-3.and PLK-4. PLKs play a role in the entry into and the exit from mitosis in mammalian cells. Especially for PLK-1 a central role with respect to the regulation of mitosis was shown (Glover et al. 1998, Genes Dev. 12:3777-87; Qian et al. 2001, MolBiol Cell. 12:1791-9). Overexpression of PLK-1 seems to be strongly associated with neoplastic cells including cancers (WO 2004/014899). Overexpression of PLK1 has been documented for various tumor types such as non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinomas, breast, ovary or papillary carcinomas as well as colorectal cancers (Wolf et al. 1997, Oncogens 14, pages 543-549; Knecht et al. 1999, Cancer Res. 59, pages 2794-2797; Wolf et al. 2000, Pathol Res Pract. 196, pages 753-759; Weichert et al. 2004, Br. J. Cancer 90, pages 815-821; Ito et al. 2004, Br. J. Cancer 90, pages 414-418; Takahashi et al. 2003, Cancer Sci. 94, pages 148-152).<br>
For the treatment of diseases of oncological nature, a large number of chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic or immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic or hormonal agents have already been suggested, which can be used as monotherapy (treatment with one agent) or as combination therapy (simultaneous, separate or sequential treatment with more than one agent) and/or which may be combined with radiotherapy or radio-immunotherapy. In this respect, chemotherapeutic agent means a naturally occurring, semi-synthetic or synthetic chemical compound which, alone or via further activation, for example with radiations in the case of radio-immunotherapy, inhibits or kills growing cells, and which can be used or is approved for use in the treatment of diseases of oncological nature, which are commonly also denominated as cancers. In the literature, these agents are generally classified according to their mechanism of action. In this matter, reference can be made, for example, to the<br>
classification made in "Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents", American Chemical Society, 1995, W.O. FoyeEd.<br>
The efficacy of Chemotherapeutic agents can be improved by using combination therapies with other Chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic, immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic or hormonal compounds. Combination therapies constitute the gold standard in many settings of cancer therapy.<br>
Even if the concept of combining several therapeutic agents or therapies already has been suggested, and although various combination therapies are under investigation and in clinical trials, there is still a need for new and efficient therapeutic compositions for the treatment of cancer diseases, which show advantages over standard therapies.<br>
It is the purpose of the present invention to provide a combination therapy with the PLK Inhibitors of Formula (I) for the treatment of various cancer diseases.<br>

Results on day 26 (end of the controls):<br>
50 mg/kg exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 i.v. significantly delays HCT 116 tumour growth (T/C = 28 %).<br>
100 mg/kg gemcitabine i.p. only marginally delays tumour growth (T/C = 65%) Higher doses of gemcitabine were not tolerated.<br>
A combined administration of 50 mg/kg exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 and of 100 mg/kg gemcitabine delays tumour growth to the same extend as exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 alone (T/C = 24%).<br>
50 mg/kg exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1, 100 mg/kg gemcitabine and their combination were well tolerated. Control mice gained 6.2 % body weight. Mice treated with 50 mg/kg exemplified<br><br>
compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 showed 8.2 % body weight increase, mice treated with 100 mg/kg gemcitabine gained 8.8 % in average and mice treated with the combination gained 8.5. % body weight.<br>
Results on day 43 (end of the study):<br>
Weekly treatment (until day 36) with exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 or a combination of exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 and gemcitabine delays the average time to reach 1000 mm in tumour volume to the same extend. There is no significant difference between the two treatment groups.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Treatment with suboptimal doses of exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 significantly delays tumour growth and is tolerated well. In contrast, the maximal tolerated dose of gemcitabine does not result in significant anti-tumour activity.<br>
Treatment with the combination of suboptimal doses of exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 and gemcitabine shows a comparable growth delay as exemplified compound Nr. 46 of Table 1 alone, indicating that the two agents do not act antagonistically in this model.<br>

The reaction mixture is purified for example over silica gel and the product (A8) is isolated from the solution or obtained by suitable crystallisation. The product (A8) is dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example dioxane and mixed with acid, for example semiconcentrated hydrochloric acid, for example in the ratio of solvent to acid of 3: 1. Then the mixture is refluxed for 1 - 48 h, for example 12 h, and the precipitate formed is isolated. If desired the product (A9) is purified by crystallisation.<br>
Step 5A<br>
Diagram 5A<br>
(Figure Remove)For example, 1 equivalent of the compound (A9) is dissolved with 1 equivalent of an activating reagent, e.g. O-benzotriazolyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and a base, for example 1.5 equivalents of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in an organic diluent, for example dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide, preferably dichloromethane or dimethylformamide.
