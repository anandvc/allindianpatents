				<td>Dithiocarbamate derivatives and their use as antibacterial agents<br>
The invention relates to the use of dithiocarbamate derivatives, including novel<br>
dithiocarbamate derivatives, as antibacterial agents in infectious diseases of mammals<br>
(humans and animals) caused by bacteria, especially diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and<br>
lepra caused by mycobacteria and infectious diseases caused by staphylococci. The<br>
invention further relates to novel dithiocarbamate derivatives as such and pharmaceutical<br>
preparations containing the same.<br>
As known, there is a threadful worldwide increase in tuberculosis infections with<br>
mycobacteria which developed resistance against the available therapeutics (B.R.Bloom,<br>
J.L.Murray, tuberculosis: commentary on a reemergent killer. Science 257, 1992, 1055-<br>
1064). Extremely dangerous is the development of multidrug resistant (MDR)<br>
mycobacteria. These are mycobacteria, resistant at least against two of the most active<br>
tuberculosis drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, but also against streptomycin, pyranzinamid<br>
and ethambutol. The proportion of MDR-TB in some countries is already more than 20%.<br>
In Germany resistance against a single tuberculosis drug raised since 1996 for 50%.<br><br>
Together with the increased number of diseases generally, worldwide<br>
tuberculosis causes a number of 3.000.000 deaths annually. Another growing problem is<br>
the therapy of infections with multiresistant staphylococci (M. Kresken,<br>
Bundesgesundheitsblatt 38, 1996, 170-178).<br>
For the treatment of such diseases there is an urgent need for new drugs with new<br>
mechanisms of actions, especially to overcome drug resistance and to overcome the<br>
known dramatic side effects of the available drugs.<br>
The present invention aims at the generation of new compounds with activity<br>
against mycobacteria as potential new tuberculosis drugs and with activity against other<br>
Gram-positive pathogens like staphylococci to overcome problems concerning resistance<br>
and drug intolerance.<br>
According to the present invention, it was surprisingly discovered that<br>
dithiocarbamate derivatives exhibit strong antibacterial activity, especially, against<br>
mycobacteria<br>
The aim is thus solved by the use of compounds of the general formula I<br><br>

tuberculosis, and against multiresistant staphylococci (MRSA) in a MIC range of. 0,4-50<br>

Determination of the inhibitory activity of the compounds of the invention against<br>
staphylococci and mycobacteria.<br>
The antibacterial activities of the compounds against multiresistent staphylococci<br>
(MRSA) strains 134/93 and 994/93 as well as against Mycobacterium smegmatls SG 987,<br>
M. aureum SB66, M. vaccae MET 1010670 and M. fortuitum B were tested by<br>
determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) by the micro broth dilution<br>
method in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) according to the NCCLS guidelines [National<br>
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards: Methods for dilution antimicrobial<br>
susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; 4th Ed.; Villanova, Ed.; Approved<br>
standard Document M7-A4. NCCLS, (1997)]. The results are presented in Table 1.<br>
Activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and two drug-resistant clinical isolates was tested<br>
by the following method for determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)<br>
and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC):<br>
Strains were inoculated onto solid Lowenstein-Jensen medium. After 21 days, the<br>
cultures grown were used to prepare an inoculum suspension corresponding to 5 x 108<br>
microbial cells/ml). With 0,2 ml of that suspension tubes with 2 ml liquid Shkolnikova<br>
medium containing corresponding concentrations of compounds under study- from 100,0<br>
to 0,195 µg/ml. were inoculated. After 14 days of incubation at 37 °C the tubes with<br>
liquid medium were centrifuged for 15min. at 3000 RPM. After discarding the<br>
supernatant, the sediment was resuspended in 0,8 ml of sterile 0,9% NaCl. 0,1 ml of the<br>
suspension was used to prepare smears subsequently stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen<br>
method. The remaining sediment was inoculated in 0,2 ml volumes into three tubes with<br>
solid drug free Lowenstein-Jensen medium to determine minimal bactericidal<br>
concentrations (MBC). The results were read after 21-28 days of cultivation at 37 °C.<br>
Controls were tubes cultured with test-strains not treated with the studied agents.<br>
Minimal bactericidal concentration of drugs (MBC) was considered as the drug<br>
concentration completely inhibiting the growth of mycobacteria on the solid medium. The<br>
bacteriostatic effect (MIC) was characterized by the presence of only individual<br><br>
mycobacteria in the smear and a strong decrease in the number of colonies grown<br>
on solid media compared to the controls. The results are presented in Table 2 as mean<br>
values of the three strains.<br><br><br><br>

arnino-6-diethyldithiocarbamoyl-5-nitro-pyrimidine.<br><br>
The invention relates to the use of dithiocarbamate derivatives<br>
for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of infectious diseases in mammals<br>
(humans and animals) caused by bacteria, especially diseases like tuberculosis (TB)<br>
and lepra caused by mycobacteria and infectious diseases caused by<br>
staphylococci. The invention further relates to novel dithiocarbamate derivatives<br>
of the formula (I), wherein X is a bivalent residue selected from the group<br>
consisting of formulae (1, 2, 3, 4) having excellent antibacterial activities, and<br>
to pharmaceutical preparations containing the same.</td>
