				<td>AN   APPARATUS METHOD FOR PURIFYING AN EVAPORATION PRODUCT TO PRODUCE PURE<br>
STEAM   AND   METHOD   THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying an evaporation product to produce pure steam. Particularly, the invention relates to the production of pure steam using a falling-film evaporator and rising channels for separating water droplets and impurities.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Highly purified steam is required for various medical purposes, such as production of<br>
10	pharmaceuticals, demanding sterilization applications and production of water for injec-<br>
tion. A method and device for production of such steam are disclosed in US patent<br>
3,875,017. A falling film evaporator as disclosed therein comprises a vertical bundle of<br>
evaporation tubes enclosed into a heating jacket, which in turn is enclosed by an outer shell<br>
so that an annular space is formed between the heating jacket and the outer shell. Water fed<br>
15	into the evaporating tubes at their upper end flows down the inner surface of the tubes,<br>
thereby evaporating and forming steam, which emerges at the lower ends of the tube bun<br>
dle. The flow of steam makes a 180° turn and flows upwards in the space between the<br>
heating jacket and the outer shell. Fins forming a spiral path are attached to the outer sur<br>
face of the heating jacket, leaving a narrow gap between their edges and the inner surface<br>
20	of the shell. The steam flowing upwards is forced into a spiraling path, whereby water<br>
droplets in the evaporation product are driven towards the outer shell by centrifugal force.<br>
The droplets adhere to the outer shell wall and form a film of water flowing downwards<br>
and finally forming a pool of liquid at the bottom of the device. From there, a stream of<br>
water proportional to the amount of pure steam produced is withdrawn as a reject stream.<br>
25	As the water phase in the evaporation product tends to be rich in impurities, these are en-<br>
riched into the reject stream. From above the spiral path, pure steam is led to the consumption points or to a condenser for producing highly pure water.<br>
A variation of the device is disclosed in US patent 5,983,842. The evaporation product<br>
emerging from the lower ends of the tube bundle is brought into a circular motion by baffle<br>
30	fins at the bottom of the device, and the rising space narrows towards the top. The spiral<br>
path is arranged into the top of the rising space and it is closed, i.e. the fins reach the inner surface of the outer shell. No downwards-flowing reject phase is formed, but the droplets accelerate and are collected into an annular channel above the spiral path. A separate tube returns the resulting water phase to the bottom of the device.<br><br>
2<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An improved method and device have been invented for enhancing the separation of water<br>
droplets and impurities in the rising channel of a falling film evaporator for production of<br>
highly pure steam. A further object of the invention is a system for the production and dis-<br>
5	tribution of pure steam, the system comprising the improved device.<br>
The device according to the present invention is used together with a vertical tube bundle with a heating jacket, i.e. a conventional type of falling film evaporator. The evaporation product emerges from the lower end of the tube bundle.<br>
According to the invention, the device for separating water droplets and impurities from<br>
10	the evaporation product comprises a length of downpipe through which the evaporation<br>
products initially flows before making a 180 ° turn and entering a rising channel between the outer surface of the downpipe and the inner surface of an intermediate shell. The downpipe may be initially tapered, forming a funnel.<br>
Spiral fins adapted in the upper part of the rising channel set the evaporation product in an<br>
15	upwardly spiraling, circular motion. According to the present invention, the intermediate<br>
shell is provided with at least one opening or outlet slit, allowing droplets carried by cen<br>
trifugal force to the periphery of the spiral path to leave.. Outside the openings, a cooled<br>
surface in the outer shell ensures, that condensation of steam takes place.<br>
Steam condensing on the inner surface of the outer shell causes a radial outward stream<br>
20	carrying steam, water droplets and impurities to the said inner surface. A water film is<br>
formed which flows down said surface in the space between the outer and intermediate<br>
shells. A pool of water is formed on the bottom of the unit, submerging the lower edge of<br>
the intermediate shell. A controlled stream of reject water is withdrawn from the pool. The<br>
pure, dry steam leaving the upper end of the spiral path exits the device.<br>
25	The invention enables the use of detachable inner parts in the steam generator, which pro-<br>
vides for easy maintenance and cleaning, as the whole of the apparatus need not be pressure vessel certified.<br>
 Brief description of the/accompanying drawings<br>
30	The invention is disclosed in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein<br>
Figure 1 shows a steam generator comprising a falling film evaporator provided with a<br>
separator unit according to the present invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows details of a separator unit according to the present invention,<br><br>
3<br>
Figure 3 is a top view section of the unit of Fig. 2, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a system for the production of pure steam, which system includes the device of Figure 2.<br>
5	Disclosure of the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a shell-and-tube heat exchanger arranged in a vertical position to form a<br>
falling film evaporator. Evaporation tubes 1 are enclosed in a jacket 2, through which a<br>
heating medium is conducted via in- and outlets 4 and 5. Feed water enters the upper ends<br>
of the evaporation tubes through inlet 6. At the lower end of the evaporator, a separating<br>
10	device according to the invention is connected.<br>
The construction of the separating device is shown in Figure 2. The evaporation product<br>
enters downpipe 7. In the embodiment shown, the upper end of the downpipe is shaped as<br>
a funnel in order to maintain the same outer diameter in the separator as in the evaporator.<br>
The evaporation product emerges from the lower end of the downpipe, encounters the wa<br>
15	ter surface 8 on the bottom of the device, and turns 180 ° to enter the annular rising channel<br>
9 between the downpipe and intermediate shell 10. Spiral fins 11 form a spiral path 12 for the evaporation product.<br>
The spiral movement of the evaporation product causes centrifugal force which force water<br>
droplets in the product to the periphery of path 12. Foreign matter present in the evapora-<br>
20	tion product may act as nuclei for condensation, and this phenomenon thus enhances the<br>
transport of this matter to the periphery of the spiral path. Pure, dry steam leaves spiral path 12 and exits the device at connection 21.<br>
At least one opening 13 is provided the intermediate shell 10 to allow droplets to enter<br>
space 16 between the intermediate shell and outer shell 14. Outer shell 14 is provided with<br>
25	a temperature control jacket 15. As this jacket is used to cool the inner surface of shell 14,<br>
steam in space 16 condense on said inner surface and form a descending water film. The<br>
condensation ensures, that no backflow occurs into spiral path 12 through openings 13. A<br>
suitable number of openings 13 of an appropriate shape may be provided. Droplets and<br>
impurities driven to the inner wall of shell 10 by centrifugal force pass through the open-<br>
30	ings, and are carried to the cooled inner wall of outer shell 14 by the radial outward stream<br>
caused by condensation of steam.<br>
The openings may be designed as vertical slits in the outer periphery of the spiral path, i.e. in shell 10. One or more slits running in parallel to the spiral fins is also possible, as well<br><br>
4<br>
as circular, oval or other shapes of openings, possible arranged with edges enhancing the capture of droplets in circular motion along the spiral path.<br>
The surface of the pool of water formed from condensate and droplets is kept above lower<br>
edge 17 of intermediate shell 10; thus flow of evaporation product is possible only along<br>
5	the route described. Spacer indents 18 may be provided to center the lower end of the in-<br>
termediate shell. A reject flow rich in impurities is withdrawn at 19. A sight glass 20 may be provided to monitor the water level.<br>
Figure 3 shows a top view of the unit of Figure 2, with the top cut off at the level of the<br>
temperature control jacket. The large arrows indicate the circular movement of the evapo<br>
10	ration product in the spiral path. Openings 13 are shown with baffles 16 to enhance the<br>
capture of droplets and impurities carried to the periphery of the path, as shown by the small arrows<br>
Preferably, the temperature of outer shell 14 is be controlled to effect a suitable rate of<br>
condensation. To conserve energy, feed water can be used in jacket 15: By means of this<br>
15	temperature control, the amount of reject water formed can be controlled according to load<br>
and purity requirements.<br>
Figure 4 shows a system for the production of pure steam. To a falling film evaporator 22,<br>
feed water is provided by means of pump 23. The evaporator comprises a separating unit<br>
24 according to the present invention. Heating steam enters through valve 25, while con-<br>
20	densate leaves by connection 26 (tubing not shown). Pure steam leaves the evaporator via<br>
line 27 and control valve 28, and enters the distribution network which includes pure steam<br>
line valves 29 and pure steam traps 30. Reject water enriched in impurities leaves separat<br>
ing unit 24 through line 31. Feed and return lines 32,33 for the temperature control jacket<br>
are provided.<br>
25	In prior art devices, corrosion and the closed structure of the separator units caused prob-<br>
lems as the steam paths were not easily accessible The inner structure was integrated with<br>
the pressure vessel shell, and could not be altered without going through the tedious proce<br>
dure involved with pressure vessel construction. In the disclosed device according to the<br>
invention, only the outer shell part must fulfil pressure vessel requirements. Accordingly,<br>
30	the inner parts and/or details thereof can be manufactured from any required, corrosion-<br>
proof material, and may be removed for cleaning and inspection. Such materials include fluorocarbon polymers, ceramic materials and special steels or other metals which need not be suited for being joined by welding to the pressure vessel shell. The inner parts may also be      exchanged      to      suit      different     throughputs      and      purity     requirements.<br><br>
