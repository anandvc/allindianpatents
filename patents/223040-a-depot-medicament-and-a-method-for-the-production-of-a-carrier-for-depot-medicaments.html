				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a depot medicament having a<br>
pharmacological active ingredient and a carrier, in<br>
particular depot medicament for parenteral administra-<br>
tion, and carrier materials for depot medicaments and a<br>
method for the production of these carrier materials.<br>
Depot medicaments, especially those which can be<br>
administered parenterally or else orally, are becoming<br>
increasingly important because they not only allow<br>
controlled release of the active ingredients enclosed<br>
in the carrier over a lengthy period, and thus a<br>
uniform blood level of the active ingredient in the<br>
body, but they additionally permit targeted use of the<br>
active ingredients and provide protection for unstable<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Carrier materials which have already been employed are<br>
a large number of different biodegradable polymers,<br>
especially polyesters such as, for example,<br>
polylactides and polypeptides, although all the systems<br>
are associated with considerable disadvantages.<br>
Thus, R. Mank et al. describe, in Pharmazie (1991),<br>
page 9 to 18, "Parenterale Depotarzneiformen auf der<br>
Basis von biologisch abbaubaren Polymeren", various<br>
starting materials which are possible in principle for<br>
producing carrier materials for depot medicaments,<br>
namely polyesters and polypeptides. Subsequently,<br>
various studies, e.g. L. Meinel et al. , Journal of<br>
Controlled Release 70 (2001), pages 193 to 202,<br>
"Stabilizing insuline-like growth factor-I in poly(D,L-<br>
lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres", have then<br>
described the use of polyesters as carrier material for<br>
active pharmaceutical ingredients.<br>
The study by Y.S. Nam and T.G. Park,<br>
J. Microencapsulation 16 (1999), pages 625 to 637,<br>
"Protein loaded biodegradable microspheres based on<br>
PLGA-protein bioconjugates" is likewise based on<br>
poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolides) , and in this case a<br>
prototype active ingredient (lysozyme) is chemically<br>
coupled to the polylactide.<br>
J.K. Li et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 86<br>
(1997), pages 891 to 895, "A Novel Biodegradable System<br>
Based on Gelatin Nanoparticles and Poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolic acid) microspheres for Protein and Peptide<br>
Drug Delivery" use gelatin-PLGA mixtures. A further<br>
publication, namely WO 94/15587, uses ionic molecular<br>
conjugates of biodegradable polyesters and biologically<br>
active polypeptides.<br>
A further example which may finally be mentioned is<br>
also the publication of A. Kosasih et al. in<br>
International Journal of Pharmaceutics 204 (2000) ,<br>
pages 81 to 89, "Characterization and in vitro release<br>
of methotrexate from gelatin/methotrexate conjugates<br>
formed using different preparation variables", where<br>
gelatin/<br>
methotrexate conjugates are used for producing depot<br>
medicaments.<br>
Polypeptides are per se a suitable material as<br>
biodegradable carriers, but their rate of dissolution<br>
is usually distinctly too high, so that, after<br>
parenteral administration, they do not provide adequate<br>
protection from proteolytic degradation or, on oral<br>
administration, almost instantaneous release of the<br>
active ingredients takes place. Peptide active<br>
ingredients in particular cannot be brought safely<br>
through the gastrointestinal tract via polypeptide<br>
carrier materials, because the acidic environment in<br>
the stomach leads both to rapid hydrolytic<br>
decomposition of the carrier material and of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Accordingly, insoluble polymers, e.g. polylactides,<br>
have been preferred in the literature as polyesters<br>
which degrade considerably more slowly in an aqueous<br>
medium.<br>
However, the biodegradation of polylactides in aqueous<br>
solution produces protons which may adversely affect<br>
the stability of the pharmacological active ingredients<br>
and, in particular, may lead to degradation thereof or<br>
to their denaturation.<br>
With pure polylactide particles there is an accelerated<br>
decomposition of the polymeric material in the first<br>
place mainly in the interior (heterogeneous bulk<br>
degradation), because an acidic medium forms there and<br>
does not exchange with the surroundings, so that the<br>
higher hydrogen ion concentration consequently formed<br>
in the particle interior leads quasi-autocatalytically<br>
to an accelerated further degradation of the<br>
polylactide particle interior. However, the largest<br>
amounts of the active ingredient are usually present in<br>
the particle interior, so that, until exchange of the<br>
liquid phase in the interior of the particle with the<br>
surroundings takes place, most of the active ingredient<br>
present in the particle has been modified or else<br>
already denatured by the hydrogen ion concentration.<br>
This results in an irregular active ingredient release<br>
which cannot be determined beforehand.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to propose a<br>
depot medicament of the type described at the outset..,<br>
with which a defined active ingredient delivery over<br>
time is obtained and with which the active ingredient<br>
is maintained in its pharmacologically active form.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention with<br>
the depot medicament described at the outset by<br>
producing the carrier with use of a carrier material<br>
which comprises, a carrier polymer formed from a<br>
polypeptide and a biodegradable polyester covalently<br>
linked thereto.<br>
Surprisingly, it is possible through the use of such a<br>
novel carrier polymer firstly to achieve defined active<br>
ingredient delivery over time, i.e. being distributed<br>
over a distinctly longer period compared with active<br>
ingredient release of active ingredients incorporated<br>
into polypeptides, and in addition substantially to<br>
avoid denaturation of the active ingredient itself.<br>
With the carrier polymer according to the invention,<br>
swelling, degradation and dissolution take place<br>
homogeneously. This firstly makes continuous diffusion<br>
of the active ingredient out of the carrier polymer<br>
particles possible and additionally means that no<br>
acidic environment can form in the interior of the<br>
particle, because this interior of the particle is<br>
connected to the exterior aqueous environment and, at<br>
the same time, the polypeptide content acts as buffer<br>
substance.<br>
The carrier polymer can be used to envelop an active<br>
ingredient phase so that the active ingredient is<br>
employed quasi-encapsulated or present in a matrix. It<br>
is also conceivable for the carrier polymer to take up<br>
the pharmacological active ingredient by adsorption<br>
and/or contain it included in pores which are present.<br>
The content of chemically bound polyester in the<br>
carrier polymer is preferably 1 mol% or more. This<br>
means that on reaction of polyester with polypeptide at<br>
least 1 mol% of the polyester employed is chemically<br>
linked to polypeptide. Unbound contents of the<br>
polyester and/or polypeptide may remain in the mixture.<br>
or, for special requirements, be removed by a workup<br>
process. It is possible to influence the despot effect<br>
of the medicaments or the intended period for release<br>
of the active ingredient via the content of polyester<br>
in the carrier polymer.<br>
The ratio by weight of polyester to polypeptide in the<br>
carrier polymer varies preferably in the range from<br>
1:99 to 99:1, preferably in the range from 30:70 to<br>
99:1. The rate of degradation of the carrier polymer<br>
can be varied within wide limits, and corresponding<br>
thereto the active ingredient release, by varying this<br>
ratio.<br>
At each of the limits there is a marked change in the<br>
degradation behavior of the carrier polymer compared<br>
with the respective starting polymers. In particular,<br>
even 1% by weight of polypeptide makes itself notice-<br>
able with its buffer effect in the process of<br>
degradation of the carrier polymer.<br>
Experience has shown that in preferred carrier polymers<br>
for depot medicaments even polypeptide contents of 2%<br>
by weight, in particular 3% by weight, are sufficient<br>
to ensure an optimal effect for the release and also<br>
the protection of the pharmacological active ingredient<br>
by the carrier. Carrier polymers with 10% by weight<br>
polypeptide or else more are most preferred.<br>
Suitable polyesters are, in particular, polyglycolides,<br>
poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolides), polyalkylene glycol-<br>
polylactide block copolymers, polyalkylene glycol-PLGA<br>
block copolymers, POE-POP-PLA block copolymers, POE-<br>
PLGA block copolymers, pply-e-caprolactams, stereo-<br>
isomeric lactide oligomers, oligolactides (n &gt;3) or<br>
polylactides.<br>
The polypeptide of the carrier polymer is preferably<br>
selected from collagen, gelatin, globular proteins and<br>
albumins or other hydrogel-forming proteins, enzymes<br>
and protein degradation products.<br>
Used as basis for the polypeptides are both mammalian<br>
collagen materials and their degradation products, in<br>
particular gelatin, such as, for example, beef gelatin,<br>
pig gelatin, sheep gelatin, but also poultry and fish<br>
gelatin. Also suitable of course are genetically<br>
engineered protein materials such as, for example,<br>
gelatin, collagen or collagen fragments, especially<br>
including those which are produced on the basis of<br>
plants and which may become increasingly important in<br>
future in the light of the BSE discussion taking place<br>
at present. Chemically and/or enzymatically modified<br>
polypeptides are likewise suitable.<br>
The gelatin can have a Bloom number in the range 30-32 0<br>
or be hydrolyzed and be obtained by the acid process<br>
(type A) or the alkaline process (type B) or by<br>
pressure/temperature or by enzymatic means.<br>
Suitable as further constituent of the carrier polymers<br>
are conventional plasticizers, buffer substances,<br>
surfactants, lipids and pore formers.<br>
In the particularly preferred carrier polymers, the<br>
linkage of polypeptide and polyester takes place via a<br>
free hydroxyl function of the polyester with a reactive<br>
group of the polypeptide.<br>
An alternative, but also supplementary, possibility is<br>
to link polypeptide and polyester via a free carboxyl<br>
function of the polyester or, after oxidation of a<br>
hydroxyl function to a carbonyl group, via the latter<br>
to a reactive group of the polypeptide.<br>
The preferred reactive group of the polypeptide is the<br>
amino function.<br>
In view of the preferred mode of linkage, lysine-<br>
containing polypeptides are to be preferred, with a<br>
content of, for example, 3% of lysine groups, where<br>
appropriate also modified lysine groups, giving very<br>
good results.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the<br>
production of a carrier material for depot medicaments,<br>
which is characterized in that a polyester is produced<br>
in a first step with activated hydroxyl groups, and in<br>
a second step a polypeptide is added and reacted with<br>
its reactive groups with the activated hydroxyl groups<br>
of the polyester to form a covalent bond.<br>
This results in a new block copolymer which is<br>
outstandingly suitable as carrier material for depot<br>
medicaments.<br>
Activation of the hydroxyl group is carried out in such<br>
a way that it is converted into a good leaving group.<br>
Suitable polyesters are a very wide range of compounds<br>
with different molecular weights (for example 2000 to<br>
300 000), especially including a wide variety of<br>
poly(D,L-lactides) or poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolides).<br>
With the last-mentioned polyesters it is possible to<br>
use a wide variety of ratios of glycolic acid and D- or<br>
L-lactic acid. It is likewise possible to use<br>
polyesters having modified ester end groups,<br>
polyalkylene glycols, polypropylene oxide-polyethylene<br>
oxide-polylactide-coglycolide- block copolymers (POP-<br>
POE-PLGA block copolymers), and various combinations of<br>
these polymers are likewise suitable as starting<br>
material.<br>
Suitable reagents for activating the hydroxyl group of<br>
the polyester are, for example, p-toluenesulfonyl<br>
chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, p-bromobenzene-<br>
sulfonyl chloride, p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride and others which are<br>
known to the skilled worker for forming good leaving<br>
groups.<br>
Since most reagents are sensitive to water, this<br>
reaction must be carried out in a dry, organic solvent,<br>
most preferably under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
Suitable solvents are tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform and others.<br>
In order to trap the hydrogen ions liberated during the<br>
reaction, it is possible to add various bases such as,<br>
for example, diethylamine, triethylamine, Hiinig's base,<br>
pyridine, 2,6-di(tert-butyl)-4-methylpyridine and<br>
others to the reaction mixture. The resulting product<br>
is isolated in a conventional way. The polypeptides to<br>
be employed are those already mentioned above and<br>
especially those which form hydrogels, such as, for<br>
example, gelatin.<br>
In order to adjust the reactivity of the activated<br>
polyester, the activated group can also be converted<br>
into a halide compound. Suitable for this is a modified<br>
Finckelstein reaction, in which case it is possible to<br>
obtain the corresponding iodide or bromide compounds.<br>
Halide compounds can additionally be obtained directly<br>
from the hydroxyl group using, for example, thionyl<br>
chloride, the more sensitive triphenylphosphine<br>
dibromide or triphenylphosphine in CCl4.<br>
The activated polyester can then be reacted with any<br>
nucleophilic group of the polypeptide, such as, for<br>
example, amino groups or hydroxyl groups. This reaction<br>
is carried out in a polar solvent, (e.g. DMF or DMSO) or<br>
in solvent mixtures such as, for example, ethyl<br>
acetate/water, acetone/water, THF/water, CHCl3/water<br>
and CH2Cl2/water.<br>
The temperature of the reaction and the reaction time<br>
can be varied depending on the reactivity of the<br>
reagents used.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the solvent is<br>
evaporated off, and the product is dried further,<br>
resulting in a white or pale yellowish powder.<br>
The presence of a novel compound was demonstrated by<br>
means of IR and NIR spectroscopy and differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC), in which case it is<br>
possible to observe a new glass transition temperature<br>
for the product. In addition, the solubility of the<br>
product is entirely different from the starting<br>
materials.<br>
These and further advantages of the invention are<br>
explained in more detail with reference to the<br>
examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
Activation of the hydroxyl groups of the polyester<br>
component<br>
3.4 g of Resomer RG503H (poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)<br>
with a molecular weight of 34 000, glass transition<br>
temperature 49.9°C from Boehringer Ingelheim) are<br>
dissolved in 10 ml of dry dichloromethane in a dry<br>
reaction flask with a capacity of 50 ml under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. Other solvents which can be<br>
employed similarly well are THF, CHC13 and ethyl<br>
acetate. 104 mg of triethylamine (dried over KOH) are<br>
added thereto. The mixture is cooled to 0°C for 15 min<br>
and then 114 mg of methanesulfonyl chloride are metered<br>
in through a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred<br>
at room temperature for one hour and then poured into<br>
an ice/water mixture for hydrolysis. The aqueous phase<br>
is extracted three times with dichloromethane, and the<br>
combined organic phases are washed with a saturated<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution. After the extraction, the<br>
organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate. The<br>
solvent is evaporated off and any remaining solvent<br>
residues are removed under high vacuum.<br>
Coupling of the polyester component to a polypeptide<br>
The freshly prepared activated polyester component is<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of chloroform and added to 20 ml of<br>
an aqueous solution of 3.7 g of pig skin gelatin (high-<br>
Bloom type A, glass transition temperature 67.9°C). The<br>
mixture is stirred at a temperature of 55°C (oil bath<br>
temperature) for 6 hours and then stirred at room<br>
temperature overnight. The solvent is evaporated as far<br>
as is possible in a rotary evaporator. The remaining<br>
water is removed in a desiccator containing a<br>
desiccant.<br>
Unreacted PLGA is removed by extraction with methylene<br>
chloride. The insoluble residue is dried in vacuo and<br>
then taken up in DMSO. The product according to the<br>
invention is thus dissolved. Subsequently, the DMSO<br>
solution containing the product according to the<br>
invention is spray dried. Spherical particles in the<br>
diameter range 1-10 mm are obtained depending on the<br>
spraying conditions.<br>
The product according to the invention has a<br>
polyester:polypeptide ratio of 90:10 and a glass<br>
transition temperature of 55.9°C.<br>
To determine the glass transition temperatures, all the<br>
investigated materials have previously been conditioned<br>
at 25°C and 25% relative humidity.<br>
The IR and NIR data of the product according to the<br>
invention differ significantly both from the starting<br>
compounds and from superimposed spectra of the starting<br>
substances.<br>
In contrast to the starting gelatin, the product<br>
according to the invention is completely soluble in<br>
DMSO. The product is insoluble in otherwise customary<br>
solvents such as alcohols, acetone (ketones), ethers<br>
and water.<br>
The kinetics of degradation can be varied within wide<br>
limits through the selection of the polyester type, its<br>
chain length and the ratio of gelatin to polyester<br>
content in the product according to the invention, and<br>
the nature of the end groups of the polyester.<br>
The kinetics of degradation of the product according to<br>
the invention can also be influenced within certain<br>
limits by appropriate selection of the gelatin.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Various polyester components, namely PLGA, PLA and POP-<br>
POE-PLGA copolymers with various ratios of the two<br>
polymer groups, are reacted in the same manner as in<br>
example 1. The reaction was successful in each of the<br>
cases, irrespective of the manufacturer of the<br>
particular polyester component (compounds supplied by<br>
Boehringer Ingelheim, Medisorp and Vako were tested).<br>
The results in terms of yield of product according to<br>
the invention are comparable with those of example 1.<br>
Example 3:<br>
The hydroxyl function of the polyester component was<br>
activated by using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride,<br>
resulting in a simplified procedure compared with the<br>
procedure in example 1:<br>
3.4 of Resomer RG503H are dissolved in 10 ml of<br>
distilled dichloromethane in a reaction vessel with a<br>
capacity of 50 ml. 104 mg of triethylamine (analytical<br>
grade) are added thereto. The mixture is cooled to 0°C<br>
for 15 min, and 190 mg of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride<br>
are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room<br>
temperature for one hour and then poured into an<br>
ice/water mixture for hydrolysis. The aqueous phase is<br>
extracted three times with dichloromethane, and the<br>
combined organic phases from the extraction steps are<br>
washed with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution. After the washing with the sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution, the organic phase is dried over magnesium<br>
sulfate, the solvent is evaporated off, and remaining<br>
solvent residues are removed under high vacuum.<br>
The advantage of this procedure is that exclusion of<br>
water is unnecessary.<br>
The freshly prepared activated polyester component is<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of chloroform, and 2 0 ml of an<br>
aqueous solution of 3.7 g of pig skin gelatin (type A)<br>
are added thereto. The mixture is stirred at a<br>
temperature of 55°C (oil bath temperature) for<br>
six hours and then stirred at room temperature<br>
overnight. The solvent is evaporated as far as is<br>
possible with a rotary evaporator. Remaining water is<br>
removed in a desiccator with a desiccant. The<br>
properties of the resulting product correspond to those<br>
of example 1.<br>
Example 4:<br>
3.4 g of Resomer RG503H are dissolved in 10 ml of dry<br>
dichloromethane in a dry flask with a capacity of 50 ml<br>
under a nitrogen atmosphere. 104 mg of triethylamine<br>
(dried over KOH) are added. The mixture is cooled at<br>
0°C for 15 min, and 114 mg of methanesulfonyl chloride<br>
are added using a syringe. The reaction mixture is<br>
stirred at room temperature for one hour and then<br>
poured into an ice/water mixture for hydrolysis. The<br>
aqueous phase is extracted three times with<br>
dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases are<br>
washed with saturated sodium dicarbonate solution.<br>
After the organic phase has been washed it is dried<br>
over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated, and<br>
the remaining solvent residues are removed under high<br>
vacuum.<br>
A difference from the procedure described in example 1<br>
is in this case conversion of the polyester component<br>
with activated hydroxyl groups (which in this case are<br>
converted into sulfonate groups) into an iodide or<br>
bromide in a modified Finckelstein reaction, in which<br>
the compound is simply stirred with an excess of sodium<br>
iodide or lithium bromide in dry acetone as solvent.<br>
After the mixture has been stirred for one day (at room<br>
temperature) , it is filtered off and the acetone is<br>
removed from the resulting product.<br>
The reactivity and thus the degree of conversion of a<br>
coupling reaction can be influenced by the subsequent<br>
Finckelstein reaction.<br>
Coupling reaction of the polyester component with the<br>
polypeptide component<br>
The freshly prepared polyester component (see above) is<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of chloroform, 20 ml of an aqueous<br>
solution of 3.7 g of pig skin gelatin (type A) are<br>
added thereto. Alternative solvents are in this case<br>
1:1 water/dichloromethane, 1:1 water/ethyl acetate, DMF<br>
and DMSO. The mixture is stirred at 55°C (oil bath<br>
temperature) for six hours and then stirred at room<br>
temperature overnight. The solvent is evaporated as far<br>
as is possible with a rotary evaporator. Remaining<br>
water is removed in a desiccator containing a<br>
desiccant.<br>
Example 5:<br>
The same procedure as in example 1 is used, but in this<br>
case a type B gelatin which is produced from bone or ox<br>
skin is used in place of the pig skin gelatin of<br>
type A. It was possible to carry out the coupling<br>
reaction of polypeptide component and polyester<br>
component in the same way as described previously.<br>
Example 6:<br>
The same production method as in example 1 is used, but<br>
enzymatically hydrolyzed gelatin (Gelita-Collagel® A)<br>
is used in the coupling reaction of the polypeptide<br>
component with the activated polyester component.<br>
Example 7:<br>
The same preparation method as in example 1 is used,<br>
but gelatin hydrolyzate (enzymatically hydrolyzed<br>
gelatin such as, for example Gelita-Sol® D/Sol DA and<br>
others) is used for the coupling reaction of the<br>
polypeptide with the activated polyester.<br>
Example 8:<br>
The same production method as in example 1 is used, but<br>
ovalbumin is used as polypeptide component for the<br>
coupling reaction with the activated polyester.<br>
Example 9:<br>
The same preparation method as in example 1 is used,<br>
but the coupling reaction of the activated polyester<br>
component with the polypeptide is carried out in basic<br>
solution. The basicity of the reaction medium enhances<br>
the reactivity and thus shortens the reaction time.<br>
The same preparation method as in example 1 can be used<br>
although the coupling reaction of the activated<br>
polyester component with the polypeptide component is<br>
carried out in an acidic solution. The reaction time is<br>
reduced by the acidic environment of the reaction<br>
medium.<br>
Example 10:<br>
The same production method as in example 1 is used, but<br>
the coupling reaction of the activated polyester<br>
component with the polypeptide component is carried out<br>
at room temperature with a prolonged reaction time<br>
compared with example 4.<br>
The same preparation method as in example 1 can be<br>
used, although the reaction of the activated polyester<br>
component with the polypeptide component is carried out<br>
by refluxing the reaction mixture with a corres-<br>
pondingly reduced reaction time.<br>
Example 11;<br>
This example is intended to describe the introduction<br>
of an active ingredient into a carrier material and<br>
thus the production of a depot medicament, using the<br>
enzyme lysozyme as model active ingredient. Both the<br>
kinetics of release and the activity of the released<br>
model active ingredient is determined.<br>
The model active ingredient lysozyme is introduced in<br>
an amount of 10% by weight based on the total solids<br>
content, of the DMSO solution contained in the workup<br>
of the reaction product of the coupling reaction of<br>
example 1, into the latter, and the solution is then<br>
spray dried in the same manner as described in<br>
example 1. The particles obtained in this way<br>
correspondingly have a lysozyme content of 10% by<br>
weight.<br>
The degradation behavior of the carrier polymer<br>
according to the invention, and the release,<br>
corresponding thereto, of the model active ingredient<br>
lysozyme, was measured in an isotonic PBS solution with<br>
serum hydrolases at a temperature of 37°C and at a pH<br>
value of 7.4.<br>
Figure 1 shows three release curves of the model active<br>
ingredient lysozyme from microparticles consisting of<br>
polypeptide (¦) (high-Bloom gelatin of type A, glass<br>
transition temperature 67.9°C), polyester ( ) (Resomer<br>
RG503A) and the carrier polymer according to the<br>
invention (?) over the course of 28 days. 10% by weight<br>
lysozyme had been added as model active ingredient to<br>
the three types of polymer, as described at the outset<br>
of this example.<br>
The polypeptide (gelatin) shows virtually immediate<br>
100% release of the model active ingredient lysozyme<br>
within the chosen timescale.<br>
The release of lysozyme from the polyester is not<br>
complete even after 28 days. As the incubation time<br>
increases there seems to be a progressive inactivation<br>
of the active ingredient and a gradual stagnation of<br>
release.<br>
Release from the carrier polymer of example 1 according<br>
to the invention takes place very uniformly over<br>
five days without an adverse effect on the activity of<br>
the active ingredient. Comparable release profiles are<br>
obtained with the carrier materials according to the<br>
invention produced as per examples 2 to 10.<br>
