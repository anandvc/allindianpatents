				<td>METHOD AND BASE STATION CONTROLLER FOR OPERATING<br>
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE OF A PLURALITY OF AVAILABLE<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and base station controller for operating in<br>
accordance with one of plurality of available wireless communication protocols, and more<br>
particularly, to a method and a base station for operating in accordance with a wireless<br>
communication protocols.<br>
Background<br>
A wireless communication system is a complex network of systems and<br>
elements. Typical systems and elements include (1) a radio link to mobile<br>
stations (e.g., a cellular telephone or a subscriber equipment used to access the<br>
wireless communication system), which is usually provided by at least one and<br>
typically several base stations, (2) communication links between the base<br>
stations, (3) a controller, typically one or more base station controllers or<br>
centralized base station controllers (BSC/CBSC), to control communication<br>
between and to manage the operation and interaction of the base stations, (4) a<br>
switching system, typically including a mobile switching center (MSC), to<br>
perform call processing within the system, and (5) a link to the land line, i.e., the<br>
public switch telephone network (PSTN) or the integrated services digital<br>
network (ISDN).<br>
A base station subsystem (BSS) or a radio access network (RAN), which<br>
typically includes one or more base station controllers and a plurality of base<br>
stations, provides all of the radio-related functions. The base station controller<br>
provides all the control functions and physical links between the switching<br>
system and the base stations. The base station controller is also a high-capacity<br>
switch that provides functions such as handover, cell configuration, and control<br>
of radio frequency (RF) power levels in the base stations.<br>
The base station handles the radio interface to the mobile station. The<br>
base station includes the radio equipment (transceivers, antennas, amplifiers,<br>
etc.) needed to service each communication cell in the system. A group of base<br>
stations is controlled by a base station controller. Thus, the base station<br>
controller operates in conjunction with the base station as part of the base station<br>
subsystem to provide the mobile station with real-time voice, data, and<br>
multimedia services (e.g., a call).<br>
After a call is initiated in an original cell, the mobile station may<br>
continue to scan the neighboring cells to determine if the signal from another<br>
cell becomes comparable to that of the original cell. When this happens, the<br>
switching system (e.g., MSC) indicates to the mobile station that the call has<br>
entered a new cell's coverage area and that a handoff can be initiated. The<br>
mobile station transmits a control message to the MSC, which states that the<br>
new cell site is now strong and identifies the new cell. The MSC initiates the<br>
handoff by establishing a link to the mobile station through the new cell while<br>
maintaining the old link. While the mobile station is locate in the transition<br>
region between the two cells, the call is supported by communication through<br>
both cells; thereby eliminating the ping-pong effect (i.e., repeated requests to<br>
hand the call back and forth between cells). The original cell site will only<br>
discontinue handling the call when the mobile station is firmly established in the<br>
new cell.<br>
The cells may operate in accordance with a variety of wireless<br>
communication standards. For example, the original cell may be operable in<br>
accordance with the code division multiple access (CDMA) 2000-1X standard<br>
while the new cell may be operable in accordance with either the CDMA 2000-<br>
1X standard or the CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard. The CDMA 2000-1X standard<br>
provides wireless data packet services at 144 kilobits-per-second (kbps) whereas<br>
the CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard may provide real time voice, data, and<br>
multimedia services on a single radio frequency carrier with existing CDMA<br>
2000 networks at data rates up to 3.07 megabits-per-second (Mbps). With the<br>
enhanced data rates provided by CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard, a user may<br>
browse the Internet, access e-mail, or transmit/receive large data files or images<br>
via a mobile station (e.g., a cellular telephone) with a wireless communication<br>
link as if the user accessed the Internet via a laptop or a desktop computer with a<br>
wired Internet connection. Further, the CDMA 1X-EV/DV may be backward<br>
compatible with other CDMA components such as IS-95A and IS-95B<br>
components. Thus, it may desirable to use the CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard<br>
when all possible.<br>
One aspect of designing a wireless communication system is to optimize<br>
the resources available to the wireless communication system. For example, a<br>
mobile station should operate in accordance with the CDMA 1X-EV/DV<br>
standard when available because the CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard provides<br>
higher data rates and greater data capacity than the CDMA 1X standard.<br>
Therefore, a need exist to optimize communication resources by operating in<br>
accordance with the CDMA 1X-EV/DV standard.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for operating a call in a<br>
wireless communication system having a plurality of base stations comprising a first<br>
base station operable in accordance with a first communication protocol and a second<br>
base station operable in accordance with a second communication protocol, and<br>
wherein a mobile station is operating in accordance to the first communication<br>
protocol, the method being operable in accordance with the second communication<br>
protocol, and comprising the steps of: detecting that the mobile station is operable in<br>
accordance with the second communication protocol based on information associated<br>
with the mobile station; detecting at least one condition of the wireless communication<br>
system suggesting a potential for improved system performance by operating in<br>
accordance with the second communication protocol; and transmitting a notification<br>
message from the first base station to the mobile station via a communication<br>

Detailed Description<br>
A method and a base station controller for operating in accordance with<br>
a wireless communication protocol are described. In a wireless communication<br>
system, a mobile station may initiate a call from a first cell serviced by a first<br>
base station, and then move into a second cell serviced by a second base station.<br>
The call may be, but is not limited to, a voice call, a data call, and a multimedia<br>
call. The first base station may be operable in accordance with a first<br>
communication protocol whereas the second base station may be operable in<br>
accordance with a second communication protocol. However, the second base<br>
station may be operable in accordance with the first communication protocol as<br>
well. For example, the first base station may be operable in accordance with the<br>
code division multiple access (CDMA) 2000 1X communication protocol, and<br>
the second base station may be operable in accordance with either the CDMA<br>
2000 1X communication protocol or the CDMA 1X-EV/DV communication<br>
protocol. A base station controller may determine whether the mobile station is<br>
operable in accordance with the second communication protocol based on<br>
information associated with the mobile station. For example, the base station<br>
controller may detect that the mobile station is operable in accordance with the<br>
second communication protocol based on a device identifier associated with the<br>
mobile station. In particular, the device identifier may be stored within a home<br>
location register (HLR), a status message, or a message associated with a service<br>
negotiation (e.g., service negotiation between the mobile station and the second<br>
base station). If the base station controller detects that the mobile station is<br>
operable in accordance with the second communication protocol then the base<br>
station controller may detect for at least one condition of the wireless<br>
communication system suggesting a potential for improved system performance<br>
by operating in accordance with the second communication protocol. That is,<br>
the base station controller may detect a condition of the wireless communication<br>
system suggesting a potential for an increase in communication resources<br>
available. For example, more Walsh codes may be available in response to the<br>
mobile station operating in accordance with the second communication protocol.<br>
The base station controller may also detect a condition of the wireless<br>
communication system suggesting a potential for a reduction in interference. In<br>
particular, the aggregate forward power given to the mobile station may be<br>
reduced by the mobile station operating in accordance with the second<br>
communication protocol. Further, the base station controller may detect a<br>
condition of the mobile station suggesting a potential for an increase in data<br>
throughput (i.e., quality of service). Upon detecting at least one condition of the<br>
wireless communication system suggesting a potential for improved system<br>
performance by operating in accordance with the second communication<br>
protocol, the base station controller may transmit a notification message from<br>
the first base station to the mobile station via a communication channel. In<br>
particular, the notification message may notify the mobile station to operate in<br>
accordance to the second communication protocol. For example, the base<br>
station controller may transmit a handoff message from the first base station via<br>
a forward dedicated control channel (F-DCCH) to the mobile station. As a<br>
result, the mobile station and the second base station may operate in accordance<br>
with the second communication protocol to improve system performance.<br>
A communication system in accordance with the present invention is<br>
described in terms of several preferred embodiments, and particularly, in terms<br>
of a wireless communication system operating in accordance with at least one of<br>
several standards. These standards include analog, digital or dual-mode<br>
communication system protocols such as, but not limited to, the Advanced<br>
Mobile Phone System (AMPS), the Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone<br>
System (NAMPS), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), the<br>
IS-55 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) digital cellular, the IS-95 Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital cellular, CDMA 2000, the Personal<br>
Communications System (PCS), 3G, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System (UMTS) and variations and evolutions of these protocols. As shown in<br>
FIG. 1, a wireless communication system 100 includes a core network (CN)<br>
110, a plurality of base station controllers (BSC), generally shown as 120 and<br>
125, servicing a total service area 130. As is known for such systems, each BSC<br>
120 and 125 has associated therewith a plurality of base stations (BS), generally<br>
shown as 140, 142, 144, and 146, servicing communication cells, generally<br>
shown as 150, 152, 154, and 156, within the total service area 130. The BSCs<br>
120 and 125, and base stations 140, 142, 144, and 146 are specified and operate<br>
in accordance with the applicable standard or standards for providing wireless<br>
communication services to mobile stations (MS), generally shown as 160, 162,<br>
164, and 166, operating in communication cells 150, 152, 154, and 156, and<br>
each of these elements are commercially available from Motorola, Inc. of<br>
Schaumburg, Illinois.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the communication network 110 generally includes<br>
a switching system, typically one or more network subsystems (NSS) 210,<br>
performing call processing within the wireless communication system 100. The<br>
network subsystem 210 generally includes a home location register (HLR) 212<br>
and a mobile switching center (MSC) 214. The HLR 214 is a database of<br>
subscriber profiles such as name and address of users, assigned telephone<br>
number, services subscribed (e.g., voice-mail, caller ID, call waiting), serial<br>
number of subscriber equipments (e.g., serial number of mobile stations), etc.<br>
The MSC 212 is an interface between typically one or more base station<br>
subsystems (BSS), generally shown as 220 and 230, and other communication<br>
networks 240 such as the public switch telephone network (PSTN) and the<br>
integrated services digital network (ISDN). Each base station subsystem 230<br>
and 240 has associated therewith a base station controller and a plurality of base<br>
stations. For example, the base station subsystem 230 may include the base<br>
station controller 120 and the base stations 142, 144, and the base station<br>
subsystem 240 may include the base station controller 125 and the base stations<br>
144, 146.<br>
After a call is initiated by a mobile station within a cell, the mobile<br>
station may move away from that cell. As shown in FIG. 2, for example, the<br>
mobile station 160 may initiate a call within a first communication cell 150 and<br>
then move into a second communication cell 152. A handoff may occur to<br>
switch coverage responsibility of the on-going call from one base station to<br>
another when the mobile station 160 moves from one cell to another.<br>
Accordingly, the BSC 120 may switch coverage responsibility from a first base<br>
station 140 to a second base station 142 when the mobile station 160 moves<br>
from the first cell 150 to the second cell 152. In particular, the first base station<br>
140 may be operable in accordance with a first wireless communication protocol<br>
and the second base station 142 may be operable in accordance with a second<br>
wireless communication protocol. For example, the first communication<br>
protocol may be, but is not limited to, the CDMA 2000 1X communication<br>
protocol (hereinafter "1X protocol") whereas the second communication<br>
protocol may be, but is not limited to, the CDMA 1X EV/DV communication<br>
protocol (hereinafter "EV/DV protocol"). The second base station 142 may also<br>
be operable in accordance with the 1X protocol if the mobile station 160 is not<br>
operable in accordance with the EV/DV protocol. Although the embodiments<br>
disclosed herein are particularly well suited for use with the 1X protocol and the<br>
EV/DV protocol, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that<br>
the teachings herein are in no way limited to those communication protocols.<br>
On the contrary, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that<br>
the teachings can be employed with other communication protocols.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a base station controller (e.g., BSC 120 shown in<br>
FIG. 2) adapted to switch from the first wireless communication protocol to the<br>
second wireless communication protocol is shown. The base station controller<br>
120 generally includes a processor 350 and a memory 360. The processor 350<br>
is operatively coupled to the memory 360, which stores a program or a set of<br>
operating instructions for the processor 350. The processor 350 executes the<br>
program or the set of operating instructions such that the base station controller<br>
120 operates as described herein. The program or the set of operating<br>
instructions may "be embodied in a computer-readable medium such as, but not<br>
limited to, paper, a programmable gate array, an application specific integrated<br>
circuit (ASIC), an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), a read<br>
only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), a magnetic media, and<br>
an optical media.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a basic flow 400 for switching from a first wireless<br>
communication protocol to a second wireless communication protocol that may<br>
be applied with the base station controller 120 shown in FIGs. 2 and 3 may start<br>
with the mobile station 160 initiating a call within the first cell 150 serviced by<br>
the first base station 140 operating in accordance with a first communication<br>
protocol as described above (i.e., box 405). The call may be, but is not limited<br>
to, a voice call, data call, and a multimedia call (i.e., a voice over Internet<br>
Protocol (VoIP) call). The mobile station 160 may then move into the second<br>
cell 152 serviced by the second base station 142, which may be operable in<br>
accordance with either the first communication protocol or a second<br>
communication protocol. As noted above, the first base station 140 may be<br>
operable in accordance with the 1X protocol whereas the second base station<br>
142 may be operable in accordance with either the 1X protocol or the EV/DV<br>
protocol. After initiating the call, the mobile station 160 may move into the<br>
second cell 152, which is serviced by the second base station 142. That is, the<br>
first base station 140 in box 410 may handoff coverage responsibility of the on-<br>
going call to the second base station 142. Accordingly, the base station<br>
controller 120 in box 415 determines whether the mobile station 160 is operable<br>
in accordance with the EV/DV protocol. For example, the base station<br>
controller 120 may determine whether the mobile station 160 is operable in<br>
accordance with the EV/DV protocol based on a device identifier such as, but<br>
not limited to, an electronic serial number (ESN) associated with the mobile<br>
station 160. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the ESN may<br>
be a unique number assigned to a cellular telephone by the manufacturer. The<br>
base station controller 120 may retrieve the ESN associated with the mobile<br>
station 160 from the HLR 214 (i.e., the ESN may be stored with the HLR 214).<br>
In another example, the base station controller 120 may determine the mobile<br>
station 160 is operable in accordance with the EV/DV protocol via a message<br>
associated with a service negotiation between the base station 142 and the<br>
mobile station 160. Yet another example may be a status message from the<br>
mobile station 160 that indicates whether the mobile station 160 is operable in<br>
accordance with the EV/DV protocol.<br>
If the base station controller 120 detects that the mobile station 160 is<br>
not operable in accordance with the EV/DV protocol then the mobile station 160<br>
and the base station 142 may continue to operate in accordance with the 1X<br>
protocol as in box 420. However, if the mobile station 160 is operable in<br>
accordance with the EV/DV protocol then the base station controller 120 may<br>
determine whether the performance of the wireless communication system 100<br>
may improved by switching from the 1X protocol over to the EV/DV protocol.<br>
To switch from operating in accordance with the 1X protocol to the EV/DV<br>
protocol, the base station controller 120 in box 430 may determine whether<br>
there is a potential for an increase in data throughput, i.e., enhance quality of<br>
service of the mobile station 160. For example, the base station controller 120<br>
may determine whether the data rate may be sustained or increased, the amount<br>
of end-to-end delay may be reduced, and/or the amount of transmission time<br>
may be reduced. If the base station controller 120 fails to detect a potential for<br>
an increase in data throughput then the mobile station 160 and the second base<br>
station 142 may continue operate in accordance with the 1X protocol as in box<br>
420. Otherwise, the base station controller 120 may proceed to box 435 where<br>
the base station controller 120 may monitor for a condition of the wireless<br>
communication system 100 suggesting a potential for an increase in<br>
communication resources available, i.e., the mobile station 160 uses less of<br>
Walsh codes as described in detail below. If the base station controller 120 fails<br>
to detect a potential for an increase communication resources available then the<br>
mobile station 160 and the second base station 142 may continue operate in<br>
accordance with the 1X protocol as in box 420. However, the flow 400 may<br>
advance to box 440 in response to the base station controller 120 detecting a<br>
potential for an increase in communication resources available at box 435. In<br>
box 440, the base station controller 120 may detect a potential for a reduction of<br>
interference, i.e., the aggregate forward power consumed by mobile station 160<br>
may be reduced. Otherwise, the mobile station 160 at box 420 may continue to<br>
operate in accordance with the 1X protocol.<br>
On the forward link (i.e., from the base station to the mobile station),<br>
both the 1X protocol and the 1X-EV/DV protocol use Walsh codes to separate<br>
multiple users on the same channel. The two CDMA protocols share a code<br>
spectrum of Walsh codes to differentiate between channels. In particular, the<br>
code spectrum includes 32 Walsh codes for data packets and 128 Walsh codes<br>
for data and/or voice packets. As a result, the code spectrum may need to be<br>
partitioned between the two CDMA protocols.<br>
To partition Walsh codes between the 1X protocol and the EV/DV<br>
protocol, a Walsh code tree 500 as shown in FIG. 5 may be used to allocate a<br>
number of Walsh codes used for calls operating in accordance with the 1X <br>
protocol (1X) and a number of Walsh codes used for calls operating in<br>
accordance with the EV/DV protocol (Ev). In particular, the Walsh code tree<br>
500 generally includes a first level 510, a second level 520, and a third level<br>
530. The first level 510 may include four Walsh codes, i.e., Walsh codes W0<br>
through W3. The second level 520 may include 32 Walsh codes, i.e., Walsh<br>
codes W0 through W31. The third level 530 may include 128 Walsh codes, i.e.,<br>
Walsh codes WO through W127. To optimize Walsh codes used by the 1X <br>
protocol and the EV/DV protocol, a branch of Walsh codes associated with a<br>
lower level may need to be fully utilized before more another branch of Walsh<br>
codes associated with a higher level may be available. That is, the second level<br>
520 is a lower level relative to the first level 510 but it is a higher level relative<br>
to the third level 530 whereas the third level 530 is a lower level relative to both<br>
the first and second levels 510, 520. Accordingly, for example, the Walsh codes<br>
of the third level 530 stemming from the Walsh code W0/32 of the second level<br>
520 (i.e., WO/128 through W7/128) must be used before the Walsh codes on the<br>
third level 530 stemming from the Walsh code W1/32 of the second level 520<br>
(i.e., W8/128 through W15/128) may be available. In another example, the<br>
Walsh codes of the second and third levels 520, 530 stemming from the Walsh<br>
code W0/4 of the first level 510 (i.e., W0/32 through W7/32, and W0/128<br>
through W30/128) must be used before the Walsh codes of the second and third<br>
levels 520, 530 stemming from the Walsh code W1/4 may be available. Based<br>
on whether the base station controller 120 detects at least one condition of the<br>
wireless communication system 100 suggesting a potential for improved system<br>
performance, a threshold of Walsh codes allocated for calls to operate in<br>
accordance with the EV/DV protocol (i.e., the EV/DV threshold (Th)) may<br>
either decrease or increase as described in detail below.<br>
Thus, referring back to FIG. 4, the base station controller 120 in box 445<br>
determines whether the number of calls operating in accordance with the<br>
EV/DV protocols, i.e., EV/DV calls (Ev), by the second base station 142 is less<br>
than the EV/DV threshold (Th). If the number of Walsh codes used for calls<br>
operating in accordance with the EV/DV protocol is greater than or equal to the<br>
EV/DV threshold (i.e., Ev &gt;= Th), then the mobile station 160 and the base<br>
station 142 may continue to operate in accordance with the 1X protocol in box<br>
420, and the base station controller 120 may reduce the EV/DV threshold (Th)<br>
in box 450 to allocate more communicate resources for the 1X protocol. In<br>
particular, a fine threshold counter at box 450 may reduce the EV/DV threshold<br>
(Th). For example, the fine threshold counter may reduce the EV/DV threshold<br>
(Th) by 1, which in turn, may be divided at box 480 by a dampening factor such<br>
as 16. To illustrate this concept, the EV/DV threshold (Th) may be 49 Walsh<br>
codes. Accordingly, the fine threshold counter at box 450 may increment the<br>
EV/DV threshold (Th) down by one to produce a reduced number of 48. At box<br>
480, the reduced number of 48 may be divided by a dampening factor of 16.<br>
Because the reduced number of 48 may be divisible by 16 to produce a whole<br>
number (i.e., a whole number of 3) at box 485, the EV/DV threshold (Th) at box<br>
490 may shift to the right on the Walsh code tree 500 to reduce the potential<br>
number of Walsh codes available for the EV/DV protocol. As a result, more<br>
communication resources (i.e., Walsh codes) may be available to be allocated to<br>
the 1X protocol, i.e., 1X may potentially shift to the right as well. On the other<br>
hand, if the fine threshold counter reduces the EV/DV threshold (Th) by one,<br>
and the reduced number (i.e., Th - 1) is not divisible by the dampening factor to<br>
produce a whole number then the EV/DV threshold (Th) may not be reduced.<br>
Continuing from the above example, the EV/DV threshold (Th) is now 48, and<br>
the fine threshold counter may increment the EV/DV threshold (Th) down by<br>
one to a reduced number of 47. Here, the reduce number of 47 may not<br>
divisible by the dampening factor of 16 to produce a whole-number quotient.<br>
Thus, the EV/DV threshold (Th) may not shift to the right to reduce the number<br>
of Walsh codes available for the EV/DV protocol until the reduced number is<br>
divisible by the dampening factor to produce a whole-number quotient (e.g., a<br>
reduced number of 32).<br>
Referring back to box 445, if the base station controller 120 determines<br>
that the number of Walsh codes used for calls operating in accordance with the<br>
EV/DV protocol is less than the EV/DV threshold (i.e., Ev 
460, the base station controller 120 (e.g., via the first base station 140) may<br>
transmit a notification message to the mobile station 160. For example, the base<br>
station controller 120 may transmit a handoff message from the first base station<br>
140 via a forward dedicated control channel (F-DCCH) to the mobile station.<br>
The handoff message may notify the mobile station 160 to operate in accordance<br>
with the EV/DV protocol as shown in box 465. Accordingly, the first base<br>
station 140 may handoff coverage responsibility to the second base station 142<br>
so that the second base station 142 may provide communication service to the<br>
mobile station 160 in accordance with the EV/DV protocol. Further, the base<br>
station controller 120 via the fine threshold counter in box 470 may increase the<br>
EV/DV threshold (Th) to allocate more communication resources for the<br>
EV/DV protocol. In particular, the fine threshold counter may increment the<br>
EV/DV threshold (Th) by one to produce an increased number. For example,<br>
the EV/DV threshold (Th) may be 71 Walsh codes so the fine threshold counter<br>
may increment the EV/DV threshold (Th) by one to produce an increased<br>
number of 72. At box 480, the increased number of 72 may be divided by the<br>
dampening factor of 16. Because the increased number of 72 is divisible by 16<br>
then the EV/DV threshold (Th) may shift to the left on the Walsh code tree 500<br>
to allocate more communication resources for the EV/DV protocol. On the<br>
other hand, the fine threshold counter may increase the EV/DV threshold (Th)<br>
by one but the increased number (i.e., Th + 1) may not be divisible by the<br>
dampening factor to produce a whole number then the EV/DV threshold (Th)<br>
may not be increased. Following the above example, the EV/DV threshold (Th)<br>
may now be 72, and the fine threshold counter may increase the EV/DV<br>
threshold (Th) by one to produce an increased number of 73. Because the<br>
increased number of 73 is not divisible by the dampening factor of 16 to<br>
produce a whole-number quotient, the EV/DV threshold (Th) may not shift to<br>
the left to increase the number of Walsh codes available for the EV/DV<br>
protocol. Until enough calls are operating in accordance with the EV/DV<br>
protocol, no more Walsh codes may be allocated for the EV/DV protocol (i.e.,<br>
the EV/DV threshold (Th) may not increase). Accordingly, more<br>
communication resources may be available for the 1X protocol.<br>
One possible implementation of the computer program executed by the<br>
base station controller 120 (e.g., via the processor 350) is illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the computer program can<br>
be implemented in any of many different ways utilizing any of many different<br>
programming codes stored on any of many computer-readable mediums such as<br>
a volatile or nonvolatile memory or other mass storage device (e.g., a floppy<br>
disk, a compact disc (CD), and a digital versatile disc (DVD)). Thus, although a<br>
particular order of steps is illustrated in FIG. 6, persons of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that these steps can be performed in other temporal<br>
sequences. Again, the flow chart 600 is merely provided as an example of one<br>
way to program the base station controller 120 to switch a base station and a<br>
mobile station to operate in accordance with one wireless communication<br>
protocol over to another. The flow chart 600 begins at step 610, wherein the<br>
base station controller may determine whether a mobile station is operable in<br>
accordance with the second communication protocol based on information<br>
associated with the mobile station. Upon detection that the mobile station is<br>
operable in accordance with the second communication protocol, the base<br>
station controller at step 620 may monitor for at least one condition of the<br>
wireless communication system suggesting a potential for improved system<br>
performance by operating in accordance with the second communication<br>
protocol. For example, the base station controller may detect a condition of the<br>
wireless communication system suggesting a potential for such as, but not<br>
limited to, an increase in communication resources available, an increase in data<br>
throughput, and a reduction in interference. Upon detecting at least one<br>
condition of the wireless communication system suggesting a potential for<br>
improved performance by operating in accordance with the second<br>
communication protocol, the base station controller at step 630 may transmit a<br>
handoff message from the first base station to the mobile station via a<br>
communication channel. In particular, the handoff message may notify the<br>
mobile station to operate in accordance with the second communication<br>
protocol.<br>
Although much of the above discussion has focused on communicating<br>
in accordance with either the 1X protocol or the EV/DV protocol, persons of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that mobile stations operating in<br>
accordance with other communications protocols may be used without departing<br>
from the scope or spirit of this disclosure.<br>
Many changes and modifications to the embodiments described herein<br>
could be made. The scope of some changes is discussed above. The scope of<br>
others will become apparent from the appended claims.<br>
