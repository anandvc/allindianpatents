				<td>APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR PERFORMING PROCESS SIMULATION USING<br>
A HYBRID MODEL<br>
Prior Applications<br>
[0001] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/443,182, filed February 5, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates generally to methods of process simulation and analysis. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to the simulation of injection molding using a multidimensional<br>
model.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] Manufacturers use process analysis and structural analysis in designing a wide variety<br>
of products, including consumer goods, automotive parts, electronic equipment, and medical<br>
equipment. It is often advantageous to simulate or otherwise model a manufacturing process to<br>
aid in the development of a particular product A computer simulation of a manufacturing<br>
process may allow accurate prediction of how changes in process variables and/or product<br>
configuration will affect production. By performing process simulation, a designer can<br>
significantly reduce the time and cost involved in developing a product, since computer<br>
modeling reduces the need for experimental trial and error. Computer-aided process simulation<br>
allows for optimization of process parameters and product configuration during the early design<br>
phase, when changes can be implemented more quickly and less expensively.<br>
[0004] A manufacturer may also use modeling to predict structural qualities of a manufactured<br>
product, such as how the product will react to internal and external forces after it is made. A<br>
structural model may be used, for instance, to predict how residual stress in a molded product<br>
may result in product warpage. Structural models aid in the design of a product, since many<br>
prospective versions of the design can be tested before actual implementation. Time-consuming<br>
trial and error associated with producing and testing actual prototypes can be greatly reduced.<br>
[0005] There is increasing demand for uniquely designed components. This is particularly true<br>
in the field of plastics manufacturing, where uniquely adaptable materials may be formed into a<br>
myriad of configurations using processes such as injection molding, compression molding,<br>
thermoforming, extrusion, pultrusion, and the like. This is also true in the manufacturing of<br>
parts made with fiber-filled materials, composites, and other specialty materials, custom-<br>
designed for specialized uses.<br>
[0006] Process and structural analysis in these fields poses significant challenges. For<br>
example, there is increasing demand for products having complex geometries. In order to<br>
properly model a molding process for a product having a complex geometry, the mold must be<br>
adequately characterized by the solution domain of the model. Modeling processes involving<br>
components with complex geometries requires significantly more computational time and<br>
computer resources than modeling processes involving components with simple geometries.<br>
[0007] Also, injection-molded plastic is viscoelastic and may have highly temperature-<br>
dependent and shear-dependent properties. These complexities further increase computational<br>
difficulty of process and structural simulations involving plastic components. Governing<br>
equations of adequate generality must be solved over complex domains, taking into account the<br>
changing properties of the material being processed. Analytical solutions of these equations over<br>
complex domains are generally unavailable; thus, numerical solutions must be sought<br>
[0008] Computer models use numerical methods to approximate the exact solution of<br>
governing equations over complex geometries, where analytical solutions are unavailable. A<br>
model of an injection molding process may include, for example, a solution domain in the shape<br>
of the mold interior, discretized to enable accurate numerical approximation of the solution of<br>
the applicable governing equations over the solution domain.<br>
[0009] Process models often simulate molds having complicated shapes by using solution<br>
domains with simplified geometries, thereby reducing required computation time and computer<br>
resources. For example, certain injection molding process simulators use a two-dimensional<br>
(2D) solution domain to simplify the geometry of the real, three-dimensional (3D) mold, thereby<br>
greatly reducing computational complexity. Many of these simulators use a Hele-Shaw solution<br>
approach, where pressure variation and fluid flow in the thickness direction are assumed to be<br>
zero. These "2.5D" models are generally beneficial for simulating injection molding of thin-<br>
walled components having relatively simple geometries. However, in components that have<br>
thick portions or complex geometries, injected material flows in all three directions, and<br>
traditional thin-wall assumptions do not apply, making the 2.SD analysis inadequate.<br>
[0010] Current 3D models of injection molding processes do not make thin-wall assumptions;<br>
they solve constitutive equations over a three-dimensional solution domain. These models are<br>
computationally complex, generally requiring significantly greater computer resources and<br>
computation times for process simulation than the simpler 2.5D models. Three-dimensional<br>
models of injection molding processes generally use a finite element scheme in which the<br>
geometry of the mold is simulated with a mesh of 3D elements. The size of the elements, or the<br>
discretization, required to accurately model a given process depends on the geometry of the<br>
solution domain and the process conditions. The generation of a 3D mesh is not trivial, and there<br>
is currently no consistent method of automatically generating a suitable 3D mesh for a given<br>
application.<br>
[0011] Determining a suitable mesh for a 2.5D, Hele-Shaw-based model is also non-trivial.<br>
For example, it is typically necessary to define a surface representing the midplane of a thin-<br>
walled component, which is then meshed with triangular or quadrilateral elements to which<br>
appropriate thicknesses are ascribed. Thus, there is an added step of determining a midplane<br>
surface that must be performed after defining solution domain geometry.<br>
[0012] Many manufactured components have at least some portion that is thin-walled or shell-<br>
like, that may be amenable to simulation using a 2.5D model. However, many of these<br>
components also have one or more thick or complex portions in which the 2.SD assumptions do<br>
not hold, thereby making the overall analysis inaccurate. One may use a 3D model to more<br>
comprehensively simulate processing of components that have both thick and thin portions.<br>
However, the computational complexity of a 3D model is much greater than that of a 2.5D<br>
model, thereby increasing the time and computer resources required for analysis.<br>
[0013] Additionally, the way a 3D model must be discretized further reduces the efficiency of<br>
a 3D process model for a component having thin portions. For example, a typical thin portion of<br>
a molded component may have a thickness of about 2 mm, whereas the length of the thin portion<br>
may be hundreds of millimeters. During the molding process, there will generally be a large<br>
thermal gradient across the thickness of the thin portion, perhaps hundreds of degrees per<br>
millimeter, whereas the temperature gradient along the length of the portion transverse to the<br>
thickness) may be extremely low. Conversely, the pressure gradient in the thickness direction<br>
will generally be very low, while the pressure gradient in the transverse direction will be very<br>
high. The high variability of these properties in at least two directions - temperature across the<br>
thickness, and pressure along the length - calls for a very dense mesh with many solution nodes<br>
in order to achieve an accurate process simulation, thereby increasing computational complexity.<br>
Thus, the time required for accurate 3D simulation of a typical component containing both a<br>
thick and a thin portion may be as much as a day or more and may require significant computer<br>
resources, due to the fine discretization required.<br>
[0014] Hybrid simulations solve simplified flow equations in the relatively thin regions of a<br>
given component and more complex flow equations in other regions. Hybrid simulations may<br>
reduce the computational complexity associated with full 3D models while improving the<br>
simulation accuracy associated with 2.5D models.<br>
[0015] A hybrid solution scheme has been proposed in Yu et al., "A Hybrid 3D/2D Finite<br>
Element Technique for Polymer Processing Operations," Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol.<br>
39, No. 1,1999. The suggested technique does not account for temperature variation and, thus,<br>
does not provide accurate results in non-isothermal systems where material properties vary with<br>
temperature, as in most injection molding systems. Example applications of the technique<br>
involve relatively simple solution domains that have been pre-divided into "2D" and "3D"<br>
portions. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a suggestion of how to adapt the technique<br>
for the analysis of more complex parts than the examples shown.<br>
[0016] U.S. Pat No. 6,161,057, issued to Nakano, suggests a simple hybrid solution scheme<br>
that solves for process variables in a thick portion and a thin portion of a solution domain. The<br>
suggested technique requires simplifying assumptions to calculate pressure and fluid velocity in<br>
both the thick and thin portions of the solution domain. For example, the technique requires<br>
using Equation 1, below, to calculate fluid velocity in the thick portion of the solution domain:<br><br>
where ux, ut, and u, are fluid velocity in the x, y, and z directions, respectively; P is pressure;<br>
and ? is flow conductance, which is defined in the Nakano patent as a function of fluid<br>
viscosity. The approximation of Equation 1 is more akin to the 2.5D Hele Shaw approximation<br>
than full 3D analysis, and Equation 1 does not adequately describe fluid flow in components<br>
having thick and/or complex portions, particularly where the thick portion makes up a substantial<br>
(nontrivial) part of the component.<br>
[0017] Current modeling methods are not robust; they must be adapted for use in different<br>
applications depending on the computational complexity involved. Modelers decide which<br>
modeling method to use based on the process to be modeled and the geometry of the component<br>
to be produced and/or analyzed. Modelers must also determine how to decompose a solution<br>
domain into elements depending on the particular component and process being simulated. The<br>
decisions made in the process of choosing and developing a model for a given component and/or<br>
process may well affect the accuracy of the model output The process of adapting models to<br>
various applications is time-consuming and generally involves significant customization by a<br>
highly-skilled technician.<br>
[0018] There is a need for a more accurate, more robust, faster, and less costly method of<br>
modeling manufacturing processes and performing structural analyses of manufactured<br>
components. Current methods require considerable input by a skilled technician and must be<br>
customized for the component and/or process being modeled.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0019] The invention provides an apparatus and methods for using CAD system data to<br>
automatically define a hybrid analysis solution domain for a mold cavity and/or molded<br>
component. The invention also provides an apparatus and methods for simulating the molding of<br>
a manufactured component using a hybrid analysis technique.<br>
10020] The invention overcomes the problems inherent in current hybrid analysis systems,<br>
which require intervention by a skilled technician to define a solution domain from CAD system<br>
output. The invention provides an automatic, standardized method of defining a hybrid solution<br>
domain from CAD system output without requiring expert human intervention. The invention<br>
also provides hybrid process analysis techniques that offer improvements upon prior techniques,<br>
i for example, by accounting for temperature variation and/or complex flow behaviors.<br>
[0021] Simulation of fluid flow within a mold cavity generally requires a representation of the<br>
mold cavity or molded component. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for<br>
simulating fluid flow that automatically divides a representation of a component and/or mold<br>
cavity into at least two portions - a portion in which a simplified analysis may be conducted,<br>
and a portion in which a more complex analysis is required. The method then includes<br>
performing a hybrid analysis- that is, solving a set of simplified governing equations in the<br>
simpler portion and a set of more complex governing equations in the complex portion. This<br>
reduces the amount of time and memory required to perform a simulation, without<br>
compromising accuracy, since the complex set of equations must be solved only where the<br>
geometry of the mold or component is complicated. The simplified analysis may be a 2.5D<br>
Hele-Shaw analysis, a 2D analysis, a 1D analysis, or any other kind of analysis in which<br>
simplifying assumptions can be made with respect to one or more dimensions and/or other<br>
variables.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, the invention automatically separates a representation of the<br>
geometry of a manufactured component or mold into at least two portions - a portion for 2.SD<br>
analysis and a portion for 3D analysis. For example, the invention may use a surface<br>
representation of a manufactured component or mold to define a solution domain for hybrid<br>
analysis, where the domain is automatically separated into one or more 2.5D-analysis portions<br>
and one or more 3D-analysis portions. The 2.5D-analysis portions of the domain each have a<br>
substantially invariant or gradually-varying thickness, while the 3D-analysis portions generally<br>
have a more complex geometry. For example, the method may identify thin-walled portions of a<br>
manufactured component for 2.5D analysis, and separate these from more complex portions -<br>
such as corners, the bases of ribs, and intersections of surfaces - for which 3D analysis is<br>
performed. In one embodiment, the method also automatically discretizes the 2.5D-analysis<br>
portions and the 3D-analysis portions of the solution domain and solves for the distribution of<br>
process variables- such as pressure, velocity, and temperature- as functions of time.<br>
[0023] The invention provides simulations having greater accuracy than current hybrid<br>
schemes. For example, an embodiment of the invention accounts for temperature by<br>
incorporating an energy conservation equation in the analysis. Furthermore, the invention allows<br>
solution of accurate forms of the mass and momentum conservation equations in the analysis<br>
scheme, without requiring simplifying assumptions, as in Equation 1.<br>
[0024] Methods of the invention provide faster, less costly simulations than traditional 3D<br>
solution techniques, since a full 3D analysis is only performed where necessary. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, the invention analyzes as much of the domain as possible - for example, thin,<br>
flat portions of the domain - with a simpler, 2.5D scheme, with negligible impact on accuracy.<br>
[0025] Methods of the invention are more robust and require less input from skilled<br>
technicians than traditional simulation techniques. For example, in one embodiment, the<br>
invention uses simple CAD system output to define a surface mesh of a component or mold to be<br>
modeled, then automatically divides the mesh into a 2.5D-analysis portion and a 3D-analysis<br>
portion via a subsurface matching technique, and automatically discretizes the two portions to<br>
form a solution domain in which hybrid analysis is performed. It is not necessary for a<br>
technician to decide how to separate a solution domain into 2.5D and 3D analysis portions, since<br>
the embodiment performs the separation automatically. In addition to CAD system output, the<br>
invention may use any other type of data file conveying a representation of the surface of the<br>
component or mold to be modeled. Since the domain is tied to the actual geometry of the<br>
component or mold surface, the invention is capable of displaying results directly on the 3D<br>
geometry of the component, making interpretation of results more intuitive for a user than<br>
schemes which require the creation of a midplane mesh, for example.<br>
[0026] In some cases it is useful to allow a user to exert control over the automatically-<br>
decomposed solution domain. For example, the automatic decomposition of a given surface<br>
domain into a hybrid solution domain may result in regions that are classified as part of the<br>
complex portion (i.e. 3D-analysis portion), in which it may be reasonable to perform a simpler<br>
analysis (i.e. 2.5-D analysis). For example, a user may wish to tolerate some reduction in<br>
accuracy in order to increase analysis speed during the early stages of design, where more<br>
accurate analysis may be performed later. In another example, a user may wish to increase<br>
simulation accuracy at the expense of the computer time required. Therefore, one embodiment<br>
of the invention allows a user to manually re-characterize a given region that has been<br>
automatically characterized as falling within either the first portion or the second portion of the<br>
solution domain.<br>
[0027] The method may also or alternatively allow a user to manually characterize part of the<br>
volume to be analyzed as either belonging to the first portion or the second portion of the<br>
solution domain prior to the automatic decomposition. This may be useful where the user knows<br>
that she/he would like a particular kind of analysis (2.5D, 3D, etc.) in a given region of the<br>
volume.<br>
[0028] Although descriptions of certain embodiments of the invention include the<br>
decomposition of a solution domain into a first and a second portion, it is within the scope of the<br>
invention to further decompose the solution domain into a third, fourth, fifth, or additional<br>
portions in which different types of analysis are to be performed.<br>
[0029] Thus, in one aspect, the invention defines a surface representation from user-provided<br>
CAD output separates the surface representation into two or more portions by analyzing and<br>
matching subsurfaces; discretizes the two or more portions; and solves for the distribution of one<br>
or more process variables - such as pressure, velocity, and temperature - as a function of time.<br>
The process being modeled may be the filling phase and/or packing phase of an injection<br>
molding process, for example. The two or more portions may include one or more 2.5D-analysis<br>
portions and one or more 3D-analysis portions. The 2.5D-analysis portions of the solution<br>
domain may be discretized with wedge elements, and the 3D-analysis portions of the solution<br>
domain may be discretized with tetrahedral elements. Dual domain elements of the type<br>
discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,096,088, to Yu et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety, may be used instead of wedge elements in the 2.5D-analysis<br>
portion. Hexahedral elements may be used instead of tetrahedral dements in the 3D-analysis<br>
portion. Other types of elements may be used instead of or in addition to those above.<br>
Furthermore, either or bom of the 2.5D analysis and the 3D analysis may be performed using a<br>
technique other than a finite element technique, such as a boundary element method (BEM), a<br>
natural element method (NEM), smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), or other meshless<br>
scheme.<br>
[0030] Interface elements provide a link between the simplified-analysis portions and the<br>
complex-analysis portions of a solution domain. In one embodiment, conservation equations and<br>
continuity requirements are enforced at the boundary between 2.5D-analysis portions and 3D-<br>
analysis portions using interface elements. The interface elements are co-linear sets of nodes or<br>
surfaces at the boundaries between the two types of portions of the solution domain. In one<br>
embodiment, the interface elements are line elements. In the case of structural analysis, an<br>
embodiment of the invention uses interface elements to satisfy continuity requirements and/or to<br>
match degrees of freedom at interfaces between the two portions of the solution domain.<br>
[0031] The invention provides a method for simulating fluid flow within a mold cavity that<br>
includes the steps of providing a surface representation of a mold cavity or molded component;<br>
automatically separating the surface representation into at least a first portion and a second<br>
portion; defining a solution domain corresponding to the first and second portions; and solving<br>
for one or more process variables in both portions of the solution domain.<br>
[0032] In one embodiment, one or more steps of the method are performed automatically in<br>
the sense that they are performed by computer, requiring limited or no input from a skilled<br>
technician. For example, in one embodiment, a discretized, hybrid solution domain is produced<br>
automatically from a user-provided description of the surface of a component or mold cavity,<br>
without requiring additional input from the user. In another example, a discretized, hybrid<br>
solution domain is produced automatically from a user-provided description of the surface of a<br>
component or mold cavity, where the user also provides (or is prompted to provide) information<br>
regarding element aspect ratio, specified edge length (SEL), process model inputs such as<br>
boundary conditions and/or initial conditions, and/or other information related to how the<br>
solution domain will be used. The production of the solution domain is still automatic, even<br>
though a user provides certain specifications, since the separation of the domain into portions<br>
and the discretization of the solution domain are subject to internal constraints imposed by the<br>
computer-performed method. Certain embodiments provide default values of one or more<br>
modeling specifications for which the user is prompted. The default values may or may not be<br>
based on the specific component and/or process being modeled. Certain embodiments provide a<br>
user the option of providing a modeling specification himself, accepting a pre-determined default<br>
value of the modeling specification, and/or using a computer-determined value of the modeling<br>
specification based on information about the component and/or process being modeled.<br>
[0033] In another aspect, the invention provides a method for automatically defining a hybrid<br>
solution domain that includes the steps of dividing a surface representation of a mold cavity or<br>
molded component into subsurfaces; matching pairs of subsurfaces, where the two subsurfaces<br>
of a given pair are separated by a substantially constant or gradually-varying thickness (but<br>
where the separation thickness of one pair may differ from that of another); and defining a<br>
hybrid solution domain having a first portion bound at least partly by the matched subsurfaces<br>
and a second portion bound at least partly by one or more of the unmatched subsurfaces. In one<br>
embodiment, the first portion is amenable to 2.SD analysis while the second portion requires 3D<br>
analysis for accurate solution. The method may further comprise using the hybrid solution<br>
domain to model a molding process such as injection molding or to determine a structural<br>
property of a molded object, such as the warpage of a molded plastic component.<br>
[0034] The invention also provides an apparatus for simulating fluid flow within a mold<br>
cavity, as well as an apparatus for defining a hybrid solution domain. Each apparatus includes a<br>
memory that stores code defining a set of instructions, and a processor that executes the<br>
instructions to perform one or more methods of the invention described herein.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0062] Table 1 lists various symbols used herein and is provided as a convenience for the<br>
reader. Entries in Table 1 do not serve to limit interpretation of embodiments of the invention<br>
described herein.<br><br>
[0063] In general, the invention relates to an apparatus and methods for performing process<br>
simulation and structural analysis using a hybrid model. A hybrid model performs both 2.SD<br>
analysis and 3D analysis in respective portions of a solution domain. Full three-dimensional<br>
analysis of molded parts is often not possible due to constraints on computer memory and CPU<br>
time. For example, in order to mesh a plastic component or mold cavity for full 3D analysis, it is<br>
often necessary to exceed the limit of addressable memory that is available on a personal<br>
computer with a 32-bit Windows operating system. The requirement for computer memory and<br>
CPU time increases for the analysis of fiber-filled components (parts), the analysis of injection<br>
molding, and the analysis of warpage of injection molded parts after exposure at elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
[0064] Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides an apparatus and methods that automatically<br>
divide a representation of a component or mold cavity into a 2.5D-analysis portion and a 3D-<br>
analysis portion via a subsurface matching technique, and that automatically discretize the two<br>
portions to form a solution domain in which hybrid analysis is performed. Since many molded<br>
components contain thin areas in which 2.5D analysis is appropriate, run times and memory<br>
requirements are greatly decreased for many applications.<br>
[0065] Figure 1 through Figure 5 provide an introductory demonstration that shows the<br>
simplification provided by application of an embodiment of the invention to simulate an<br>
injection molding process. Figure 1 depicts the solution domain 100 for simulating injection<br>
molding of a plastic component or mold cavity, determined using a traditional technique. The<br>
solution domain 100 of Figure 1 is discretized using tetrahedral elements for full 3D analysis.<br>
Overall discretization is complex, since the entire domain is made up of three-dimensional<br>
tetrahedral elements, sized sufficiently small so that simulation is accurate. For example, values<br>
of process variables such as temperature, pressure, and fluid velocity, may vary more in<br>
geometrically complex portions of the domain, thus requiring smaller discretization for accurate<br>
simulation in these regions. In addition to the dense discretization, the full 3D governing<br>
equations must be solved throughout the entire domain in order to solve for distribution of<br>
process variables using the solution domain 100 of Figure 1.<br>
[0066] Certain portions of the solution domain 100 of Figure 1 are thin sections, each having a<br>
relatively constant thickness. It is not necessary to perform full 3D analysis in these sections.<br>
For example, methods of the invention can automatically divide a surface representation of a<br>
component or mold cavity into a portion having pieces each with a relatively constant thickness,<br>
where this portion can be modeled using a 2.5D analysis technique. Figure 2 depicts a portion of<br>
the solution domain 200 of the component/mold cavity in Figure 1 which can be modeled using a<br>
2.5D analysis technique. This 2.5D-analysis portion 200 includes pieces 202,204,206,208, and<br>
210, each having relatively constant thickness (although the thickness of one piece may differ<br>
from the thickness of another piece). The 2.5D-analysis portion is automatically discretized<br>
using 6-node wedges. Alternatively, dual domain elements can be used instead of wedges.<br>
[0067] The remaining portion of the solution domain for the component/mold cavity is<br>
automatically discretized using 3D elements, such as tetrahedral elements, suitable for 3D<br>
analysis. Figure 3 depicts the portion 300 of the solution domain of the component/mold cavity<br>
in Figure 1 that is discretized using 3D tetrahedral elements. This 3D-analysis portion 300<br>
includes pieces 302,304,306,308,310, and 312. These pieces represent portions of the<br>
component/mold cavity at the intersection of two or more surfaces, at corners, and at other<br>
locations where thickness varies suddenly.<br>
[0068] Figure 4 depicts a hybrid mesh solution domain 400 used to simulate injection molding<br>
of the component/mold cavity in Figure 1. The solution domain 400 contains pieces of relatively<br>
constant thickness, shown in Figure 2, as well as the remaining pieces, shown in Figure 3. The<br>
hybrid solution scheme solves for the distribution of one or more process variables - such as<br>
pressure, velocity, and temperature - as a function of time, throughout the solution domain 400.<br>
The scheme includes use of a 2.5D analysis technique for the wedge elements and a 3D analysis<br>
technique for the tetrahedral elements. Interlace elements lie at the boundary between the wedge<br>
elements and the tetrahedral elements, where conservation equations and continuity requirements<br>
are enforced.<br>
[0069] Figure 5 depicts pressure distribution 500 at a particular point in time during the<br>
injection molding of the illustrative component/mold cavity in Figure 1 for which a hybrid<br>
solution domain is determined and a combined 2.5D/3D flow analysis is performed according to<br>
an embodiment of the inventioa In this case, the point in time corresponding to the pressure<br>
distribution 500 shown is the switchover from the filling phase of injection molding to the<br>
packing phase. The method for automatically determining the hybrid solution domain and me<br>
method of performing the combined 2.5D/3D flow analysis is described in more detail herein<br>
below.<br>
[0070] Figure 6 is a schematic flow diagram 600 depicting components in a system for<br>
automatically defining a hybrid mesh solution domain, which is used to solve for the distribution<br>
of process variables as functions of time. Embodiments of the invention also include systems<br>
that automatically define a hybrid mesh solution domain without necessarily using the solution<br>
domain to solve for process variables. The system includes components for preprocessing CAD<br>
system output 604 to provide an overall surface mesh; analyzing surface elements 608 of the<br>
surface mesh; locating feature edges 612 of the surface mesh; classifying subsurfaces 616 of the<br>
surface mesh; remeshing 620 the surface mesh; matching subsurfaces 624 of the surface mesh,<br>
thereby identifying portions of the solution domain in which 2.5D analysis can be performed;<br>
diseretizing the 2.5D-analysis portion 628 of the solution domain; locating interface elements<br>
632; discretizing the 3D-analysis portion 636 of the solution domain; and solving the governing<br>
equations 642 subject to initial conditions, boundary conditions, and process inputs to obtain the<br>
solution for the distribution of process variables throughout the solution domain, as functions of<br>
tune. Each of these components are discussed in more detail herein below.<br>
[0071] The preprocessor component 604 in Figure 6 uses as input a geometric description of a<br>
component to be manufactured, for example, CAD output 602, and turns it into a representation<br>
for the surface of the three-dimensional component/part or mold cavity 606. Input can be any<br>
convenient form of geometric description. For example, the preprocessor component 604 can<br>
use CAD system output in Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IOES) format (for example,<br>
IOES Version 5.3, as well as later and earlier versions). In another example, the component 604<br>
uses a CAD system output file associated with a common geometry kernel, such as Parasolids*<br>
or ACIS. Furthermore, the component 604 may use a CAD system output file associated with a<br>
proprietary geometry kernel, such as Pro-Engineer* from Parametric Technology Corporation of<br>
Needham, MA, or I-DEAS® from Structural Dynamics Research Corporation of Milford, OH. A<br>
further means of usable CAD system output includes stereolithography (STL) formatted files,<br>
used in creating 3D prototypes. This format consists of planar triangles with no connectivity in<br>
the finite element sense. Any file format that describes a mesh covering the outer surfaces of a<br>
three-dimensional solid region may be used as input. A remesher (i.e. see component 620 in<br>
Figure 6, discussed below) is used to improve the mesh quality for subsequent processing.<br>
[0072] The preprocessor 604 of Figure 6 meshes the outer surfaces of the three-dimensional<br>
part/component/mold cavity with a surface mesh, for example, a mesh of triangular surface<br>
elements. Such a mesh is frequently available from a CAD system using a geometry kernel. For<br>
CAD output in stereolithography format, it is generally necessary to remesh the<br>
part/component/mold cavity surface representation to create a set of triangles with a reasonable<br>
aspect ratio. A method of remeshing is depicted in component 620 of Figure 6, discussed in<br>
more detail herein below. Alternatively, the surface representation provided by the preprocessor<br>
component 604 is made up of quadrilateral elements. Other two-dimensional elements are also<br>
possible.<br>
[0073] Once the preprocessor 604 in Figure 6 produces a surface mesh of triangular surface<br>
elements, a surface element analyzer 608 determines properties of the surface elements, and<br>
stores them for later use. The surface element properties are used to divide the surface mesh into<br>
subsurfaces, which are then classified and matched to determine a first portion of the solution<br>
domain where simplified analysis (i.e. 2.5D analysis) is sufficient. The surface element analyzer<br>
608 of Figure 6 determines element properties and nodal properties 610 associated with each of<br>
the surface elements. For example, the surface element analyzer 608 computes and stores the<br>
following element properties for each of the surface elements:<br>
• Area;<br>
• Normal at the element centroid;<br>
• Edge lengths of the element;<br>
• Internal angles at the vertices of the element;<br>
• Adjacent elements (contiguous elements);<br>
• Bending angle between adjacent elements (the angle between normals of adjacent<br>
elements); and<br>
• Bending curvature between adjacent elements (the curvature of a cylindrical<br>
surface on which the bending edge and nodes of the adjacent element lie).<br>
[0074] Figures 7 A and 7B demonstrate computation of bending angle between adjacent<br>
elements, determined by the surface element analyzer 608 of Figure 6. Elements El and E2 of<br>
Figure 7A happen to lie along a feature edge 708 separating two subsurfaces 704,706. Figure<br>
7B depicts a cross-sectional view of elements El and E2 as viewed in the direction of arrow 702<br>
in Figure 7A. The bend angle between adjacent elements E1 and E2 is shown in Figure 7B as<br>
the angle between the normals of elements E1 and E2.<br>
[0075] Figures S A and 8B demonstrate computation of bending curvature (or "element<br>
curvature") between adjacent elements, determined in the surface element analyzer 608 of Figure<br>
6. Figure 8B depicts a cross-sectional view of elements El and E2 as viewed in the direction of<br>
arrow 702 in Figure 8A. Bending (element) curvature associated with element El on the edge<br>
El and E2 equals 1/R1, while bending (element) curvature associated with element E2 on the<br>
edge El and E2 equals 1/R2, as shown in the diagram 800 of Figure 8B. The bending curvature<br>
is the curvature of a cylindrical surface on which the bending edge and nodes of the adjacent<br>
element can lie.<br>
[0076] In addition to element properties, the surface element analyzer 608 of Figure 6<br>
determines nodal properties 610 associated with each of the surface elements of the surface mesh<br>
606. In one embodiment, the following nodal properties are computed and stored for each of the<br>
surface elements:<br>
• Measure of minimum curvature at the node;<br>
• Connecting elements (the set of elements connected to the node); and<br>
• Number of edges connected to the node.<br>
The minimum curvature at a given node is the smallest bending curvature of all the elements<br>
attached to the given node.<br>
[0077] The feature edge locator 612 of Figure 6 men uses the properties computed above to<br>
determine the location of feature edges of the 3D part/mold being modeled. A feature edge is an<br>
edge that would be apparent to one viewing me part/mold. The feature edge locator 612<br>
identifies elements of the surface mesh adjacent to a feature edge. In one embodiment, the<br>
feature edge locator identifies feature edges by first classifying each of the elements of the<br>
surface mesh as planar elements or "curved" elements. For example, a planar (triangular)<br>
element either (1) has each of its three bend angles either equal to zero or greater than a given<br>
feature edge threshold, or (2) has at least one adjacent planar element where the bending angle<br>
between the element and the adjacent planar element is zero. All other elements are classified as<br>
"curved" elements (even though, individually, they are actually planar). In one embodiment, the<br>
feature edge locator 612 in Figure 6 identifies feature edges at the following locations: (1) where<br>
the bend angle between two adjacent elements is greater than a given feature edge threshold (for<br>
example, from about 40° to about 45°); (2) at the edge between planar elements and curved<br>
elements; and (3) where there is a significant change in bending (element) curvature direction,<br>
for example, as shown in the diagram 800 of Figure 8B.<br>
[00781 Once the feature edge locator has located feature edges, further organization of the<br>
subsurfaces is performed to identify the remaining edges separating all of the subsurfaces of the<br>
surface mesh. The subsurface classifier 616 in Figure 6 performs an element-by-element,<br>
pseudo-recursive process to group elements into subsurfaces according to bending angle and<br>
bending curvature, so that adjacent elements having similar bending curvature are grouped<br>
together. High-curvature subsurfaces will generally bound regions of the 3D-analysis portion of<br>
the solution domain, while planar and low-curvature subsurfaces will generally bound regions of<br>
the 2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain. The pseudo-recursive process performed by<br>
the subsurface classifier 616 begins by determining the location of large planar subsurfaces<br>
(sheets) of the surface mesh. In one embodiment, a large planar sheet is a planar sheet in which<br>
one of its elements has an area greater than a threshold value, based on the mesh geometry size,<br>
average associated thickness, and number of elements. Here, the size of the elements are based<br>
on a reasonable aspect ratio. By identifying large planar sheets first, the subsurface classifier<br>
616 avoids grouping large elements into curved subsurfaces. After a large planar sheet is<br>
identified, adjacent planar elements are added to the large planar sheet as long as planar surface<br>
(sheet) constraints are met In one embodiment, the planar sheet constraints are as follows:<br>
(1) The edge bend angle inside the sheet (i.e., the maximum element-to-element bend<br>
angle along the edge, as illustrated in Figures 7A and 7B) is less than a tolerance<br>
value, set, for example, from about 5° to about 15°; and<br>
(2) Each node of the sheet has an off-distance below a tolerance level, set from about<br>
0.05 times an average associated thickness (see below) to about 0.1 times the average<br>
associated thickness;<br>
where "off-distance" is the perpendicular distance from a node to the "plane of the subsurface,"<br>
and the plane of the subsurface is the plane defined by the largest element of the subsurface.<br>
[0079] The next step in the subsurface classifier 616 is the identification of "other" (not large)<br>
planar sheets. In one embodiment, all connecting planar (non-"curved") elements that are not<br>
already part of a large planar sheet make up one of these "other" planar sheets.<br>
[0080] The next step in the subsurface classifier 616 is the element-by-element, pseudo-<br>
recursive classification of low-curvature subsurfaces, followed by high-curvature subsurfaces.<br>
Adjacent "curved" elements (as defined above) with similar curvatures are grouped into an<br>
individual curved sheet (subsurface). The pseudo-recursive process proceeds by applying<br>
criteria to determine whether an adjacent "curved" element belongs to the current curved<br>
subsurface. In one embodiment, there are four criteria used to determine if a neighboring<br>
(adjacent) element belongs to the current curved subsurface:<br>
(1) The bending angle between the neighboring (candidate) element and the current<br>
subsurface is less than about 1°;<br>
(2) The curvature of the neighboring element is less than a threshold value (applied for<br>
low-curvature subsurfaces). For example, a low-curvature subsurface must have a<br>
maximum curvature less than or equal to about (0.06/tbickness), where "thickness" is<br>
the average thickness associated with the subsurface (see below);<br>
(3) The curvature of the current subsurface and the neighboring element is larger than<br>
about (0.5/thickness), where "thickness" is the average thickness associated with the<br>
current subsurface (applied for high-curvature subsurfaces); and<br>
(4) The bending angle between the neighboring element and the current subsurface is<br>
less than a threshold edge bending angle (set, for example, from between about 30°<br>
and about 45°), and the curvature of the neighboring element is less than about 4<br>
times the minimum curvature of the current subsurface, where the minimum<br>
curvature of the subsurface is the smallest element-to-element bend angle of all<br>
elements belonging to the subsurface.<br>
[0081] The next step in the subsurface classifier 616 is to group all the remaining elements into<br>
planar subsurfaces. The subsurface classifier 616 then identifies the final edges separating the<br>
subsurfaces, and computes and stores the following properties for each edge:<br>
• Length;<br>
• Bending angle;<br>
• Direction of bending (in or out); and<br>
• Adjacent elements.<br>
[0082] Next, the subsurface classifier 616 identifies surface loops. Surface loops are the<br>
oriented edges of the subsurfaces. For example, a rectangular surface with a hole cut in it will<br>
have two associated loops - one for the outer edges of the rectangle and one describing the<br>
interior hole. The subsurface classifier 616 computes and stores the following loop properties:<br>
• Length; and<br>
• Edges connected to the loop.<br>
[0083] Finally, the subsurface classifier 616 computes and stores the following properties for<br>
each subsurface:<br>
• Perimeter,<br>
• Area;<br>
• Nodes in the subsurface;<br>
• Elements in the subsurface;<br>
• Edges;<br>
• Loops; and<br>
• Minimum measure of curvature associated with the subsurface.<br>
Subsurface curvature, as described herein, is different from element curvature in that subsurface<br>
curvature is characterized by a minimum, maximum, average, and/or range of the element edge<br>
curvatures belonging to the subsurface.<br>
[0084] Once the subsurfaces are classified, the mesh associated with each subsurface is further<br>
refined or coarsened according to given criteria for optimizing mesh quality and efficiency, for<br>
purposes of numerical analysis. For example, the remesher 620 in Figure 6 coarsens or refines<br>
the mesh of a given subsurface according to a user-defined value of Specified Edge Length<br>
(SEL). The larger the value of SEL, the coarser the remeshed mesh will be and, conversely, the<br>
smaller the value of SEL, the finer the remeshed mesh will be. In one embodiment, a default<br>
value of SEL is calculated based on the complexity of the model. A user can increase or<br>
decrease the value of SEL to trade off accuracy for analysis speed and, vice versa, subject to<br>
internal constraints. In one embodiment, internal constraints are imposed on allowable values of<br>
SEL such that the maximum off-distance of the remeshed nodes to their positions in the original<br>
mesh is below a given threshold (for example, from about 1% to about 5% of SEL), and such<br>
that the maximum bend angle is below a given threshold (for example, a value from about 15° to<br>
about 30°).<br>
[0085] In one embodiment, the remesher 620 in Figure 6 performs the following sequence:<br>
(1) After all the subsurfaces of the surface mesh are classified by the subsurface<br>
classifier 616, the boundaries of the subsurfaces (edges) are remeshed. Here, the<br>
loops of each sheet are divided into lengths (SEL) by inserting and/or merging nodes<br>
on the current set of edges that define the loops;<br>
(2) Constraints are applied in the merging of edge nodes according to internal constraints<br>
on SEL. These constraints ensure that the loop does not drift substantially from its<br>
initial shape. For example:<br>
(a) Bend angle constraints are applied: If the loop is bent more than a specified bend<br>
angle, then that section of the loop is not subject to the edge length criteria (edge<br>
nodes should not be merged according to SEL).<br>
(b) Chord height constraints are applied: If the chord height of a short edge node (a<br>
node on an edge shorter than SEL) with respect to its adjacent node is larger than<br>
a specified length, then that section of the loop is not subject to the edge length<br>
criteria (edge nodes should not be merged according to SEL); and<br>
(3) SEL is applied to the mesh of the subsurface to be remeshed. For example, an<br>
iterative "bisection and merge algorithm" is performed as follows:<br>
(a) Start with the longest element in the subsurface and insert nodes by bisecting the<br>
longest edge of the element if the edge is significantly larger than SEL (for<br>
example, if the edge is larger than about 1.5 times SEL).<br>
(b) Look for element edges that are significantly shorter than SEL (for example,<br>
where the edge is smaller than 0.S times SEL), and merge these nodes together.<br>
(c) Repeat until all the element edge lengths lie in a close range of SEL.<br>
Figure 9 depicts the application of "bend angle constraints" and "chord height" constraints in<br>
item (2) above. The chord height 908 must be less than a given threshold, and the bend angle<br>
must be less than a given threshold in order for SEL to be applied in coarsening a mesh by<br>
merging original nodes 902 on the loop to form new elements 906. Figure 9 shows seven<br>
original elements 904 which are replaced by two new elements 906 following merging according<br>
to a value of SEL, subject to bend angle constraints and chord height constraints.<br>
[0086] Note that in all of the mesh modification operations, the element node linkages can be<br>
modified to optimize the aspect ratio about a node at any time in the process. This is a local<br>
optimization operation, and can be defined as one or more "rules" for meshing around nodes.<br>
This causes certain components of the system represented in Figure 6 to be iterative and/or<br>
recursive.<br>
[0087] Figure 10 is a schematic 1000 that demonstrates the formation of additional elements<br>
on a subsurface 1002 at sequential stages of a remeshing procedure, as in the "bisection and<br>
merge" algorithm in item (3) above, or as in a local optimization operation. In this case, the<br>
mesh of a subsurface is further refined by bisecting the longest side of an element on the<br>
subsurface to create additional elements. For example, mesh 1002 is the initial mesh. The mesh<br>
is refined by defining a node at the midpoint of the longest element side and extending lines to<br>
one or more vertices not yet connected to the midpoint, thereby creating one or more additional<br>
triangles. This is illustrated by subsequent meshes 1004,1006,1008,1010, and 1012 in Figure<br>
10. In meshes 1004,1006,1008,1010, and 1012, the midpoint of the longest side (denoted by<br>
"o") and the dotted lines extending from this point define the new elements. Remeshing<br>
continues until the elements satisfy one or more criteria on size (i.e., given by SEL). For<br>
example, Figure 11 shows an initial stereolithography surface representation 1100 used in a<br>
remeshing procedure. Figure 12 shows the surface representation of Figure 11 after remeshing<br>
(1200) using the bisection algorithm discussed above.<br>
[0088] After the subsurfaces are remeshed, the subsurface matcher 624 in Figure 6 determines<br>
which subsurfaces are "matched subsurfaces," and the remaining subsurfaces are each classified<br>
as "unmatched subsurfaces" or "edge subsurfaces." The matched subsurfaces are later connected<br>
with wedge elements to form a first portion of the solution domain - the portion in which 2.5D<br>
analysis can be accurately performed.<br>
[0089] Matched subsurfaces are those that are related to another surface such that a notion of<br>
thickness between them can be sensibly defined. The thickness between matched subsurfaces is<br>
either substantially invariant or gradually varying. For example, Figure 13 depicts a cross-<br>
section 1300 of a T-shaped object (a filleted rib) and illustrates matching individual subsurfaces<br>
of the overall surface representation. In the cross-section 1300, line segments ab, cd, and gh are<br>
on edge subsurfaces. Line segments aj and ed are matched to be. Line segment fg is matched to<br>
hi. The curved sections ij and ef are unmatched. It is not possible to sensibly define a thickness<br>
of unmatched subsurfaces ij and ef.<br>
[0090] Figure 14 further illustrates the concept of matching subsurfaces. Figure 14 shows a<br>
cross section 1400 through a filleted rib. Here, line segments ab, cd, and gh are on edge<br>
subsurfaces. Line segments aj and ed are matched to be. Line segments fg and hi are matched.<br>
Curved sections ij and ef are unmatched. Note that line segments fg and hi are still considered<br>
matched, despite the taper. However, if the taper is extreme, the surfaces forming the tapered<br>
ribs may not be matched.<br>
[0091] Matched subsurfaces arc subsurfaces containing matched elements. Matching is<br>
performed element-by-element and subsurface-by-subsurface until all the elements that can be<br>
matched are considered. In one embodiment, the subsurface matcher 624 of Figure 6 applies<br>
criteria to determine whether two triangular elements are matched or not. In one embodiment,<br>
these two criteria are (1) whether the "Triangle Match Angle" (TMA) is less than a given value<br>
(for example, from about 30° to about 45°) and (2) whether "Triangle Match Distance" (TMD) is<br>
less than a given value based on the mesh average thickness, the matching subsurface's average<br>
width, and the matching subsurface's boundary characteristic. A boundary characteristic of a<br>
subsurface is the ratio of its expending edge length to the total edge length. The determination of<br>
TMA and TMD are demonstrated in the diagram 1500 of Figure 15. To determine TMA, first,<br>
find the centroid of the triangle to be matched (Triangle A in Figure 15). Then, project it along<br>
its normal to find the intersection with a triangle on a subsurface on the opposite side of the<br>
model (surface representation). Here, this is the "Projection point" on Triangle B in Figure 15.<br>
TMA is then calculated as shown in Figure 15. Triangle Match Distance, TMD, is the<br>
perpendicular distance of the projection used in calculating TMA, shown in Figure 15.<br>
[0092] The subsurface matcher 624 in Figure 6 uses a "collapse" procedure to identify which<br>
of the unmatched subsurfaces are edge subsurfaces, and to assign the following subsurface<br>
properties: (1) a sheet (subsurface) type, indicating how it was collapsed (primary/secondary or<br>
edge); (2) a "move distance" for each node; and (3) a "move vector" for each code.<br>
[0093] Figures 16A through 16C demonstrate steps in an example collapse procedure.<br>
Matched subsurfaces 1602 and 1604 are "collapsed" together to a final collapse position 1608,<br>
shown in diagram 1600 of Figures 16A and 16B. The collapse direction is established using the<br>
matching information from the previous mesh step and the subsurface properties, including the<br>
area, eigendimension, and the boundary characteristic. "Primary sheets" are the subsurfaces that<br>
are chosen to be moved first. The moving distance of a node on a primary sheet provides the<br>
average matching distance of the sheet The moving distance of a node on a secondary sheet is<br>
the distance from the node to the opposite primary sheet minus the primary sheet moving<br>
distance. After collapse, the nodes on both the primary 1602 and secondary sheets 1604 in<br>
Figure 16A have been moved to the midplane 1608. Non-matched sheets (subsurfaces) (1642,<br>
1644 of Figure 16C) do not move in the collapsing process. A non-matching sheet whose area<br>
shrinks to about 20% or less of its original size after primary and secondary sheets are collapsed<br>
to the midplane is considered an "edge subsurface." Subsurfaces 1642 and 1644 in Figure 16 are<br>
edge subsurfaces, since then* areas shrink to zero (or near zero), in the example shown in Figure<br>
16. Note that the collapse procedure is used to identify edge surfaces and to assign subsurface<br>
properties. The collapse procedure is not used to consolidate the mesh into a midplane<br>
representation. The mesh is "re-inflated" to its original node positions, shown in diagram 1640<br>
of Figure 16C.<br>
[0094] After categorizing the subsurfaces, the subsurface matcher 624 of Figure 6 assigns<br>
thicknesses to the subsurfaces. These thicknesses are used, for example, in performing a 2.5D<br>
flow analysis (i.e. using a Hele Shaw approximation) in a first portion of the solution domain.<br>
The subsurface matcher 624 assigns a thickness to elements on matched subsurfaces equal to the<br>
average distance between the subsurfaces. Elements on an edge subsurface are assigned the<br>
thickness of the matched subsurfaces to which they are attached. Elements on unmatched<br>
subsurfaces are assigned an average thickness of surrounding elements on matched subsurfaces.<br>
In some embodiments, thicknesses are not assigned to edge subsurfaces and/or unmatched<br>
subsurfaces, as they may be unnecessary for performing a flow analysis in certain applications.<br>
[0095] The subsurface matcher 624 categorizes each of the subsurfaces of the model as either a<br>
matched, unmatched, or edge subsurface, and determines a set of paired elements that define the<br>
possible 2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain between the matched subsurfaces (the<br>
2.5D-analysis portion may comprise one or more non-contiguous regions). After the possible<br>
2.SD regions are identified, the final 2.5D regions making up the 2.5D-analysis portion of the<br>
solution domain are determined by removing all paired elements which: (1) connect to surface<br>
edges for which the edge bending angle is greater than a given value (for example, about 30°);<br>
(2) connect to unmatched elements that do not belong to an edge surface; and/or (3) form a small<br>
patch of 2.5D regions. The remaining paired elements define (bound) the 2.5D-analysis portion<br>
of the solution domain (first portion), and the rest of the elements define (bound) the 3D-analysis<br>
portion of the solution domain (second portion).<br>
[00961 After the solution domain is divided into a 2.5D-analysis portion and a 3D-analysis<br>
portion, the portions are discretized using the matched, unmatched, and edge subsurface<br>
elements. In one embodiment, the element pairs in the 2.5D-analysis portion are converted into<br>
6-node wedge elements, and the remaining subsurface elements are closed up with triangular<br>
elements to form the 3D-analysis regions, which are meshed with tetrahedral elements.<br>
[0097] The first portion solution domain discretizer 628 in Figure 6 converts the matched<br>
element pairs that define the 2.5D-analysis portion (first portion) into 6-node wedge elements<br>
(where each wedge element has one node at each of its six corners). Calculations are performed<br>
at each grid point. The six nodes defining the wedge element may all have different pressures,<br>
and solution grid points through the thickness of the wedge may provide increased accuracy.<br>
However, in thin areas where the flow approaches two-dimensional flow, the pressures on the<br>
top three nodes of the wedge are about the same as the pressures on the respective bottom three<br>
nodes of the wedge, and either no grid points are needed, or only 1,2, or 3 grid points are<br>
needed, for example. In one example, the number of grid points used along the thickness of an<br>
element is in a range from about 3 to about 40. In another embodiment, the number of grid<br>
points used along the thickness of an element is in a range from about 8 to about 20. A lower<br>
number of grid points provides a faster analysis, which may be more suitable for design<br>
iterations early in the development of a product. For each wedge element, there may be any<br>
number of grid points through the thickness of the element, depending on the desired accuracy of<br>
the model. In some embodiments, there are no solution grid points between element nodes, and<br>
solutions are obtained only at the six nodes of each element. With the addition of grid points,<br>
each wedge is a discretely layered element. In an alternative embodiment, each wedge is a<br>
continuously layered element.<br>
[0098] The interface element locator 632 in Figure 6 defines interface elements along the<br>
boundary between the first portion (i.e. 2.5D-analysis portion) and the second portion (i.e. 3D-<br>
analysis portion) of the solution domain. The interface element locator 632 uses one or more of<br>
the following types of interface elements, for example, according to the types of first portion and<br>
second portion elements to be linked:<br>
• Disk-shaped element with a central node on the end of a ID-analysis element and<br>
a plurality of surrounding nodes belonging to the 3D-analysis region elements<br>
which contact the end face of the ID-analysis element;<br>
• Line-shaped element which connects the 2.5D-analysis element (i.e. wedges) and<br>
3D-analysis elements (i.e. tetrahedra);<br>
• Rectangular-shaped element with 4 corner nodes belonging to a 2.5D-analysis<br>
element (which may or may not connect to 3D-analysis elements) and any<br>
number of 3D-analysis element nodes lying on and inside that 2.5D-analysis<br>
element; and<br>
o Triangular-shaped element with 3 corner nodes belonging to a 2.5D-analysis<br>
element (which may or may not connect to 3D-analysis elements) and any<br>
number of 3D-analysis element nodes lying on and inside that 2.5D-analysis<br>
element.<br>
Alternatively, the interface element locator 632 may use a different type of element than those<br>
listed above.<br>
[0099] In an embodiment in which the first portion of the solution domain comprises wedge<br>
elements, a set of line elements is created along the interface of the 2.5D-analysis portion and the<br>
3D-analysis portion after the 2.5D-analysis portion is meshed with wedge elements by using<br>
nodes at the corners of each wedge plus one or more grid point nodes in between. The number<br>
of grid points used may be from about 3 to about 40. Generally, the number of grid points<br>
ranges from about 8 to about 20. Alternatively, fewer (0,1, or 2) or more (over 40) grid points<br>
than indicated by these ranges is used.<br>
[0100] The interface element locator 632 uses all of the nodes of the interface elements to<br>
make triangular elements to close the 3D-analysis portion (second portion) of the solution<br>
domain. At the open edges of the 2.5D-analysis portion (first portion), the grid points and nodes<br>
forming the wedges are discretized with a surface mesh to ensure that the first and second<br>
portions are connected. For example, in applying the above classification and discretization<br>
procedure to a planar, thin square plate, the region to be meshed with 2.5D-analysis wedges (first<br>
portion of the solution domain) is defined internal to all edges of the plate. The region between<br>
the wedges and the exterior edges of the plate are then meshed with 3D-analysis tetrahedral<br>
elements. This mesh allows accurate calculation of heat loss at the edge of the plate. However,<br>
for thin regions, the heat loss is minimal and may be ignored. Thus, in one example, the<br>
invention automatically places wedge elements at free edges of the model in order to lower the<br>
number of tetrahedral elements needed.<br>
[0101] After the interface elements are located and the closing step above is performed, the<br>
second portion solution domain discretizer 636 in Figure 6 discretizes the 3D-analysis portion<br>
with three-dimensional elements. The three-dimensional elements can be tetrahedral elements,<br>
hexahedral elements, or some combination of the two. However, any type or combination of<br>
polyhedral elements can be used.<br>
[0102] In an alternate embodiment, the steps of discretizing the first and second portions of the<br>
solution domain and creating interface elements are ordered differently than described above.<br>
For example, components 628,632, and 636 of the system of Figure 6 may operate in a different<br>
order than shown in Figure 6. For instance, the relative ordering of these three components of<br>
the system of Figure 6 may be any of the following: (1) 628,632,636; (2) 628,636, 632; (3)<br>
632,628,636; (4) 632, 636,628; (5) 636,628,632; and (6) 636,632,628.<br>
[0103] Figure 17 depicts an example of a hybrid mesh solution domain 1700 with a 2.5D-<br>
analysis portion and a 3D-analysis portion separated by interface elements, automatically created<br>
from CAD output according to an embodiment of the invention. The 2.5D-analysis portion is<br>
made up of regions 1702,1704,1706 (light colored) that are discretized with wedge elements.<br>
The wedge elements connect matched subsurfaces of the model. The 3D-analysis portion 1708<br>
(darker colored) is discretized with tetrahedral elements. Linear interface elements lie along the<br>
boundary of the 2.5D-analysis and 3D-analysis portions and are shown as heavy line segments,<br>
such as those at 1710 and 1712. Figure 18 depicts a close-up 1800 of the interface elements (for<br>
example, 1710,1712,1802,1804,1806,1808,1810) and tetrahedral elements (1708) of the<br>
hybrid solution domain in Figure 17.<br>
[0104] The equation solver 642 in the system 600 of Figure 6 solves for the distribution of one<br>
or more process variables (such as pressure, temperature, flow velocity, stress, viscosity, and<br>
fluid flow front) in the first and second portions of the solution domain as functions of time. The<br>
governing equations include mass, momentum, and energy balances, and they are solved<br>
(concurrently) in the respective portions of the solution domain, subject to process inputs 640<br>
that describe the process being modeled, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Examples<br>
of solution procedures performed by the equation solver 642 are shown herein below for the<br>
2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain, the 3D-analysis portion of the solution domain,<br>
and the interface elements.<br>
[0105] The 2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain may be discrctized using wedge<br>
elements that have or do not have grid points along their thicknesses. A low Reynolds number<br>
fluid flow is typical for fluid injection into narrow regions such as those that make up the 2.5D-<br>
analysis portion (first portion) of the solution domain. In one embodiment, a general Hele-Shaw<br>
approximation is used for process simulation with low Reynolds number flow in the 2.5D-<br>
analysis portion. The governing equations include momentum, energy, and mass (continuity)<br>
conservation equations, and are applied in the 2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain. The<br>
governing equations for the 2.5D-analysis portion are shown in Equation 2 through Equation 4 as<br>
follows:<br><br>
where Equation 2 represents the conservation of momentum equation in Cartesian coordinates (z<br>
is the thickness direction), Equation 3 represents the conservation of energy equation, and<br>
Equation 4 represents the continuity (conservation of mass) equation. In one embodiment,<br>
equations 2-4 are solved in each region of the 2.5D-analysis portion subject to the boundary<br>
conditions shown in Equations 5 and 6 as follows:<br><br>
where Tw is the mold wall temperature, and the mold walls are located at z = h and z = -h, where<br>
h is the halfwall thickness associated with the given region of the 2.5D-analysis portion. Heat<br>
conduction in the x- and y-directions may be ignored, and a slab formulation may be used to<br>
facilitate the calculation of temperature profile and viscosity profile (where viscosity may be a<br>
strong function of temperature). In an alternative embodiment, this simplification is not made.<br>
A finite difference method may be used for the solution of the energy balance in the 2.5 D-<br>
analysis portion, where convection is based on an up-winding scheme. An example of an<br>
upwinding scheme is described in co-owned European Patent Number 1218163, issued<br>
November 19, 2003, and U.S. Patent Application No. 09 / 404, 932, (Indian pending Patent<br>
Application No. IN/PCT/2002/00344 filed on March 13, 2002), the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0106] By combining Equation 2 (momentum balance) and Equation 4 (continuity equation),<br>
the equation solver 642 in Figure 6 derives finite element equations for the pressure field in the<br>
2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain using a Galerkin weighted residual approach.<br>
Equation 7 is obtained by expressing lumped mass on the right side of the equation:<br><br>
where Se is the elemental flow conductance, defined as in Equation 8:<br><br>
and where ATe is the top area of an element and ABe is the bottom area of the element. In<br>
general, an asymmetric temperature profile results in an asymmetric viscosity profile. In this<br>
case, the flow conductance in a slab channel may be expressed as in Equation 9;<br>
 (9)<br>
where integrals arc evaluated from z = -h to z = h.<br>
[0107] Thus, distributions of any of the following process variables throughout the 2.5D-<br>
analysis portion may be obtained as functions of time, for example: temperature, pressure, fluid<br>
velocity, fluid flow front position, internal energy, density, fluidity, viscosity, and gradients<br>
thereof.<br>
[0108] In an alternative embodiment, the distribution of a process variable throughout the<br>
2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain is determined using the method of U.S. Patent<br>
Number 6,096,088 to Yu et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety, so that flow fronts along matching subsurfaces are synchronized. In an embodiment<br>
employing this solution technique for the 2.5D-analysis portion of the solution domain, interface<br>
elements are planar in shape and lie between the 2.5D-analysis regions and the 3D-analysis<br>
regions.<br>
[0109] The 3D-analysis portion of the solution domain is discretized with three-dimensional<br>
tetrahedral elements; however, other shapes may be used. The 3D analysis may include solution<br>
of Navier Stokes equations or the simplified Stokes equation, where inertia and gravity are<br>
ignored. Body forces such as inertia and gravity are generally negligible in injection molding<br>
where the fluid has a high viscosity and a low Reynolds number, but this simplification is not<br>
necessary.<br>
[0110] The governing equations that are solved in the 3D-analysis portion include momentum,<br>
energy, and mass (continuity) conservation equations. In one embodiment, the generalized<br>
momentum equation is expressed as in Equation 10:<br><br>
For modeling an injection molding process, the following boundary condition in Equation 14<br>
may be applied: <br>
where 3ft is the mold/plastic interface. For linear tetrahedral elements in the 3D-analysis<br>
portion of the solution domain, the equation solver 642 uses element interpolation functions as<br>
the weighting functions. Applying the Bubnov-Galerkin approach then yields residual Equations<br>
15-22:<br><br><br>
Without modification, this system may be ill-posed, since it does not satisfy the "inf-sup" or<br>
Babuska-Brezzi stability condition. Spurious pressure modes may cause severe oscillation in the<br>
pressure solution, and the velocity solution may lock, regardless of mesh size. Therefore, the<br>
Equation solver uses a "Mini" element formulation to stabilize the system. In the Mini element<br>
formulation, an enriched space of velocity trial functions is constructed out of the linear trial<br>
space and the space of bubble functions as in Equation 24:<br><br>
where 0, is the usual linear interpolation in the element and is the bubble velocity in the<br>
element The bubble velocity is expressed in terms of a bubble shape function, F(x), as in<br>
Equation 25: <br>
The quantity ueb is an element vector such that ub has constant direction in an element but a<br>
varying magnitude determined by the bubble shape function, F(x). A cubic bubble shape<br>
function, which is actually quartic in three-dimensions, is one option, shown as in Equation 26:<br><br>
A quadratic bubble shape function may be used for greater stability, as in Equation 27:<br><br>
Since the linear subspace and the bubble subspace are orthogonal, Equation 28 applies:<br>
Having solved for the linear part of the velocity, U,, the actual velocity, v+, is obtained from<br>
Equation 24. For a cubic bubble, the bubble velocity is zero at nodes such that the nodal values<br>
of 0, are, in fact, the desired solutioa For a quadratic bubble, the bubble velocity at each node<br>
within an element, according to Equation 27, is 2vab • In one embodiment, this term is<br>
considered to be negligible.<br>
[0111] Alternatively, the equation solver 642 of Figure 6 solves for the distribution of process<br>
variables in the 3D-analysis portion of the solution domain using a boundary element method<br>
(BEM). Here, the boundary element method only requires an external mesh and there is no need<br>
to mesh the interior of the 3D-analysis portion of the solution. A boundary element method may<br>
be applied for simple fluids and/or for linear structural analysis. The equation solver 642 may<br>
solve a nonlinear problem with an extended BEM or a meshless technique by inserting points<br>
within the 3D-analysis portion.<br>
[0112] The equation solver 642 in Figure 6 can solve for the temperature field in the 3D-<br>
analysis portion of the solution domain. The generalized energy conservation equation that is<br>
solved in the 3D-analysis portion is shown in Equation 35:<br><br>
Equation 35 accounts for the variation of temperature in a mold as a function of position and<br>
time, due to convection, compressive heating, viscous dissipation, heat conduction to/from the<br>
mold, and/or heat sources such as heat of reaction and/or other heat source effects. The energy<br>
conservation equation is generally solved concurrently with the mass and momentum<br>
conservation equations. Equation 35 may be solved using one or more finite element techniques,<br>
finite different techniques, or a combination of finite difference and finite element techniques.<br>
[0113] In one example, the equation solver 642 solves the energy balance of Equation 35 for<br>
the 3D-analysis portion of the solution domain using a finite element method. Shear heating and<br>
compressive heating may be explicitly calculated based on the results of the preceding time step.<br>
Convection may be calculated based on an up-winding method and temperature interpolation.<br>
Heat capacity can be lumped or consistent An example of an up-winding method and<br>
temperature interpolation method is described in co-owned European Patent No. 1218163, issued<br>
November 19,2003, and U.S. Patent Application No. 09/404,932, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0114] Thus, distributions of any of the following process variables throughout the 3D-analysis<br>
portion may be obtained as functions of time, for example: temperature, pressure, fluid velocity,<br>
fluid flow front position, internal energy, density, fluidity, viscosity, and gradients thereof.<br>
[0115] An energy balance is generally not solved for the interface elements; however, their.<br>
connectivity information may be used for the heat convection calculation when heat is converted<br>
between a 2.5D-analysis region and a 3D-ana]ysis region.<br>
[0116] The interface elements can bridge up the geometry and/or degrees-of-freedom<br>
discontinuities on the boundaries between regions of the solution domain. For example, the<br>
where NT represents the top node and NB represents the bottom node of the interface element,<br>
and where h is the half-height of the interface element.<br>
[0117] Figures 19-23 demonstrate the simulation of fluid flow within an example mold cavity.<br>
The simulation includes automatically creating a hybrid solution domain for the mold cavity<br>
using CAD output, automatically discretizing the domain, and solving for the distribution of<br>
process variables within the solution domain.<br>
[0118] Figure 19 depicts an injection-molded, plastic component 1900 for an automobile<br>
dashboard. In order to manufacture the plastic component 1900, it is desired to create a model of<br>
the component for performing a simulation of flow within the mold during injection molding.<br>
The process simulation allows, for example, adjustment of process conditions, injection point<br>
placement, identification of potential processing trouble spots, and/or adjustment of the<br>
component design at any stage of the design and/or manufacturing process, without (or with a<br>
minimum of) experimental trial-and-error.<br>
[0119] Figure 20 is a graphical representation 2000 of STL-formatted CAD output produced<br>
during the design of the plastic component 1900 of Figure 19. The mesh 2000 in Figure 20 is<br>
not yet adapted for use in finite element analysis. The system 600 depicted in Figure 6 uses the<br>
CAD output 602 to automatically create a hybrid solution domain comprising a 2.5D-analysis<br>
portion and a 3D-analysis portion, which is then used in finite element analysis. These steps are<br>
described in more detail herein above.<br>
[0120] Figure 21 depicts the hybrid mesh solution domain 2100 for the component 1900 as<br>
automatically determined using the system 600 of Figure 6. The hybrid mesh solution domain<br>
2100 has two portions - the light-colored portion 2104 is discretized using 6-node wedge<br>
elements, and the dark-colored portion 2102 is discretized using tetrahedral elements. A 2.5D<br>
flow analysis will be performed in the light-colored portion 2104, and a 3D flow analysis will be<br>
concurrently performed in the dark-colored portion 2102.<br>
[0121] The flow analysis is performed, for example, by the equation solver component 642 of<br>
the system 600 of Figure 6, as described in more detail above. The solver 642 determines the<br>
distribution of process variables throughout the solution domain. For example, Figure 22 depicts<br>
a map 2200 of times at which the flow front reaches points within the mold of the component<br>
1900 of Figure 19, given the location of the two injection points 2202 and 2204. The location of<br>
the two injection points 2202 and 2204 are two of the process inputs 640 used by the equation<br>
solver 642 in the system 600 of Figure 6. In the example shown in Figure 22, the time required<br>
to completely fill the mold for the component 1900 is 2.771 seconds. According to the index at<br>
reference 2206, the red-colored portions are the last portions of the mold to be filled.<br>
[0122] Figure 23 depicts the pressure distribution at the filling/packing switchover point in the<br>
injection molding of the component 1900 of Figure 19. Pressure distribution is another of the<br>
process variables determined using the hybrid mesh solution domain 2100 of Figure 21 and the<br>
combined 2.5D/3D flow analysis approach described herein. Other process variables that may<br>
be determined include, for example, temperature distribution, fluid velocity, viscosity, fluid flow<br>
front position, internal energy, density, fluidity, and gradients thereof, all of which may be<br>
expressed as functions of time.<br>
[0123] Figure 24 depicts a computer hardware apparatus 2400 suitable for use in carrying out<br>
any of the methods described herein. The apparatus 2400 may be a portable computer, a desktop<br>
computer, a mainframe, or other suitable computer having the necessary computational speed<br>
and accuracy to support the functionality discussed herein. The computer 2400 typically<br>
includes one or more central processing units 2402 for executing the instructions contained hi the<br>
software code which embraces one or more of the methods described herein. Storage 2404, such<br>
as random access memory and/or read-only memory, is provided for retaining the code, either<br>
temporarily or permanently, as well as other operating software required by the computer 2400.<br>
Permanent, non-volatile read/write memory such as hard disks are typically used to store the<br>
code, both during its use and idle time, and to store data generated by the software. The software<br>
may include one or more modules recorded on machine-readable media such'as magnetic disks,<br>
magnetic tape, CD-ROM, and semiconductor memory, for example. Preferably, the machine-<br>
readable medium is resident within the computer 2400. In alternative embodiments, the<br>
machine-readable medium can be connected to the computer 2400 by a communication link. For<br>
example, a user of the software may provide input data via the internet, which is processed<br>
