				<td>Method and apparatus for acoustical outer ear characterization<br>
The invention relates to a method of characterizing acoustical properties of an outer ear, the method comprising the steps of transmitting a first acoustic signal towards the outer ear, receiving a second acoustic signal from the outer ear, and characterizing acoustical properties of the outer ear on the basis of the second acoustic signal. The invention ftirther relates to an apparatus and a system for characterizing acoustical properties of an outer ear, the qjparatus and the system each comprising: transmitting means arranged to transmit a first acoustic signal towards the outer ear, receiving means arranged to receive a second acoustic signal fixjm the outer ear, and characterizing means arranged to characterize the acoustical properties of the outer ear on the basis of the second acoustic signal.<br>
In security applications, as well as in every day life, authentication and identification of persons are of paramount importance. Credit cards, ED cards, passports, and badges are used by many people on a daily basis but are stolen and abused quite frequently. As a result, there is a strong drive to develop reliable biometrics that can be acquired in a preferably non-intrusive and convenient manner. However, certain biometrics such as fingerprints have a disadvantage in that they are left involuntarily by their owners and, as a result, malicious parties have successfully forged fingerprints, e.g. using gummy fingers.<br>
The drive for new biometrics has led to the use of acoustical properties of the outer ear as a biometric. U.S. patent 5,787,187 discloses a system for verifying/recognizing the identity of an individual by characterizing the acoustical properties of the ear canal as a biometric. To this end, a source signal is emitted into the ear canal that comprises e.g. broadband noise, or fi^quency tones. However, individuals whose outer ear acoustics are being characterized perceive such source signals as intrusive and/or xmpleasant.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, it is an object to provide a method<br>
of acoustical outer ear characterization that is less intrusive for the person being characterized.<br>
This objective is realized in that the method as set forth in the opening paragraph is fiirther characterized in that the first acoustic signal comprises at least one of the<br>
following elements: music, and speech.<br>
The advantage of using music or speech for characterizing the outer ear is that a person beiag characterized will find the characterization process less intrusive than when being confronted with (white) noise, or tone sequences. The present method has the further advantage that it can be conducted during a conversation, or when a person is listening to a message and/or music. The melhod is so inconspicuous that characterization can take place without the person being aware of it.<br>
When transmitting the first acoustic signal con:^rising music and/or speech towards the human outer ear, part of the signal will be reflected by the pinna (the visible part of the outer ear), the ear canal, and the eardrum. A second acoustic signal is cultured by using a microphone, which signal con^ses part of the reflected signal that in turn comprises information with respect to the outer ear structure. The second acoustic signal is used to characterize acoustical properties of the outer ear.<br>
In a first embodiment, the amplitude of the spectral components present in the second acoustic signal is established in order to characterize acoustical properties. In an alternative embodiment, a transfer fiinction is established on the basis of the frequency domain representation of both the source representation and the received second acoustic signal in order to characterize acoustical properties.<br>
The use of music and/or speech allows the use of low-cost consumer elecfronics loudspeakers and microphones for characterization.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, the method of characterizing acoustical properties of an outer ear can be further enhanced by the addition of noise to the music and/or speech used in the characterization process. The added noise may comprise white or colored noise. Although music and/or speech allow characterization, music and/or speech may not comprise all relevant spectral components in the audible spectrum.<br>
Reliability can be improved by adding noise comprising at least the relevant missing spectral components. Furthermore, by using a relatively low amplitude noise signal, in comparison with that of music and/or speech, the less intrusive nature of music and/or speech can be preserved.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, the method of characterizing acoustical properties of an outer ear can be fiirther enhanced by using a particularly elegant method of adding noise. The human auditory system is a very sensitive system that can pick up even minute quantities of noise, provided it is quiet. However, in the presence of music and/or speech, the distinguishing capabihties of the human auditoiy system are compromised.<br>
By exploiting a technique referred to as spectral and temporal masking, it is possible to add noise to an audio signal without a person noticing. More information related to perceptual coding can be found, inter alia, in "Auditory Perception and the MPEG Audio Standard", by Chris A. Lanciani, published by the Georgia Institute of Technology, August 11,1995, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The psycho-acoustic model of the human auditory system is used elaborately in lossy digital audio compression techniques. These techniques exploit, inter alia, the fact that the human ear has difficulty in distinguishing small amplitude frequency components in the presence of a, spectrally proximate, frequency component with a substantially larger amplitude. As a result, it is possible to use a coarser quantization for the smaller components, or discard the smaller components altogether in order to reduce the size of the audio representation.<br>
In the above example, the "compressed" signal is distorted; the quantization errors, and/or discarded frequency components can be considered as noise that is added to the original signal. The present invention suggests adding noise based on the psycho-acoustic model of the himian auditory system in order to exploit the tenqjoral and/or spectral masking effect, and not to compress the resulting signal but add inaudible noise in order to shape the frequency spectrum of the signal so as to improve characterization of the outer ear.<br>
Methods according to all of these aspects of the invention can be used in systems for biometric authentication or identification of a user that use acoustical properties of the outer ear as a biometric. Usually, two phases can be distinguished in systems for biometric authentication and identification;<br>
an enrohnent phase during which reference data is acquired, and<br>
an authentication/identification phase during which authentication/identification data is acquired and compared with previously enrolled reference data.<br>
During both phases, the acoustical properties of an outer ear are characterized. As a result, the present invention can be used beneficially in methods for biometric enrohnent, authentication, and identification that use acoustical properties of the outer ear as a biometric.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, it is an object to provide an apparatus for acoustical outer ear characterization that is less intrusive for the person being characterized.<br>
This objective is realized in that the apparatus as set forth in the opening paragraph is further characterized in that the first acoustic signal comprises at least one of the following elements: music, and speech.<br>
In one embodiment, an apparatus according to the present invention comprises a noise generation means that allows the addition of noise to the first acoustic signal conprising music and/or speech. In an alternative embodiment, the noise generation means is used in combination with a noise generation control means that allows the addition of noise based on a psycho-acoustic model of the human auditory system.<br>
The invention fiirther relates to a device for enrolliog the acoustical properties of an outer ear of a person that characterizes acoustical properties according to the present invention, as well as to an ^aratus for authenticating and an ^aiatus for identifying a person using acoustical properties characterized according to the present invention.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, it is an object to provide a system for acoustical outer ear characterization that is less intrusive for the person being characterized.<br>
This objective is realized in that the system as set forth in the opening paragraph is fiirther characterized in that the first acoustic signal comprises at least one of the following elements: music, and speech.<br>
The present invention further relates to a telecommimication system configured to provide telecommunication services via a network and remotely authenticate a persoa The system comprises two terminals, a first terminal associated with a party, and a second terminal operated by a person. The system is arranged in such a way that, according to the present invention, the two terminals jointly characterize the acoustical properties of the outer ear of the person, wherein the characterized acoustical properties are used by an authentication means conqjrised in the first terminal that matches the characterized acoustical properties of the outer ear of the person with enrolled acoustical ear properties in order to authenticate the person to said party.<br>

Well-known biometric methods for identity verification are based on biometrics such as fingerprints, irises, feces, or speech. Here, measurements are performed in order to obtain biometric data, also known as feature vector data. As a rule, not all biometrics are suitable for all plications. Characteristics such as the price and/or form factor of the required sensors, or the effort involved in deriving characteristics/feature vectors from sensor measurements, can limit the scope of application.<br>
The acoustical properties of the outer ear, in particular the pinna (the outer flap of the ear), the ear canal, and the eardrum, can be measured with little effort, using low-cost loudspeakers and microphones. The shape of the outer ear, such as the folds of the pinna and the length and shape of the ear canal, differs among individuals, as can be observed by visual conparison of the ears of individuals. These differences are even more pronounced for acoustical measurements, and in particular for the transfer fimction of the outer ear when<br>
characterized, using a loudspeaker close to the ear and a microphone close to or in the ear canal.<br>
When a pre-defined first acoustic signal is transmitted towards the outer ear of a person, the acoustic signal is in part reflected by the outer ear. In parallel, a second acoustic signal is received for characterization. Such a characterization can be used to acquire biometric data for biometric authentication/identification.<br>
In one embodiment, characterization involves transforming the second acoustic signal into the fi-equency domain and comparing the resultant spectrum with previously enrolled spectra. In a different embodiment, a transfer fimction is established to characterize the acoustical properties of the outer ear. Such a transfer fimction can be established in such a way that it is independent of the first acoustic signal and, as a result, can be used to characterize an ear on the basis of different acoustic signals. To establish a transfer fimction during enrolment that is truly independent of the first acoustic signal, it is relevant to establish the transfer fimction for all relevant fi-equency components. Furthermore, in order to be able to reliably authenticate or identify a person, the first acoustic signal used during authentication/identification must provide sufficient information so as to differentiate between individuals.<br>
The ear canal is a resonance system that, together with the pinna, provides rich features. In a coarse approximation, the outer ear is a one-dimensional system that resonates at one quarter of the acoustic wavelength. The resonance is typically aroxmd 2500 Hz but varies from person to person. The typical resonance fi-equencies correspond to typical dimensions of both pinna and ear canal.<br>
The length of the ear canal and the curvature of the pinna have dimensions that can range fi-om millimeters to a few centimeters. To be able to detect these shapes and curvatures, the acoustic probing waves should have proper wavelengths. Assuming that it is possible to resolve structures of the order of one tenth of the wavelength, an acoustic signal ranging fi-om 100 Hz to 15kHz will allow detection of feature sizes up to approximately 2 mm, which seems sufficient for distinguishing most features. Although the range from 100 Hz to 15 kHz may suffice for practical applications, it does not exclude the use of the present invention for other ranges of the audible spectrum ranging fiom 20 Hz to 22 kHz.<br>
When a fixed pre-determined signal is used as a first acoustic signal during enrolment and identification/authentication, it may suffice to compare the frequency spectrum of the resultant second acoustic signal in order to authenticate and/or identify individuals. To be able to differentiate between different individuals, the first acoustic signal<br>
must have sufficient characteristic features available. Generally, the first acoustic signal does not need to have a flat spectrum in which all ftequency components are present to allow successful characterization for authentication/identification.<br>
However, when characterizing a transfer ftmction in order to obtain an iiput- independent transfer function, all fi-equency conponents are relevant. In order to obtain an accurate transfer ftmction, all frequency components must be present. In particular in music and or speech, in which generally not all spectral components are present, noise can be added to coir5)lement the spectrum. In this way, the resultant outer ear transfer flmction can be characterized for all relevant fiiequency components in the range of 100 Hz to 15 kHz, rather than for a subset. As a result, the transfer ftmction can also be used in combination with other excitation signals.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts an ^aratus 100 according to the present invention for characterizing the acoustical characteristics of an outer ear. The ^aratus comprises a storage means, such as a hard disk, for storing a digital representation of music 105 and speech 110. Either representation can be used to measure fte response, although typically music will have a somewhat broader frequency spectrum than speech.<br>
One of the representations is selected as the source signal 115. The apparatus 100 uses the source signal to generate a first acoustic signal 125. To this end, the apparatus 100 corrprises a loudspeaker 120 positioned preferably in the proximity of the ear. The loudspeaker 120 transmits the first acoustic signal 125 towards the outer ear 130, comprising piima 131, ear canal 135, and eardrum 140. Parts of the first acoustic signal 125 are reflected by the outer ear 130, and a resulting second acoustic signal 150 is received by a microphone 155 fitted close to or in the ear canal 135. The second acoustic signal 150 may also comprise environmental noise that can be measured separately by using a fiirther microphone (not shown), and can be subsequently weighted and subtracted from the output of the microphone 155.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the characterizing means 160 uses both the selected source signal 115 as well as the microphone output 170 to establish a transfer ftmction characterizing the outer ear 130.<br>
In order to establish this transfer ftmction, the characterizing means 160 transforms the source signal 115, x(t), into a frequency domain representation X((ji), using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Use of other time domain-to-frequency domain transformations, including Discrete Fourier Transforms can also be envisaged. The <br>
microphone output 170, r(t), is also transformed, resulting in Subsequently, a transfer fimction is established:<br>
H(0i)=R(0i)/X:((£,)<br>
This transfer function is an approximation of the actual transfer function and can be represented as a cascade of:<br>
the transfer function of the loudspeaker (Hisp(G))), the transfer fimction of the outer ear (Hear((i&gt;)), the transfer function of the microphone (H„uc(i)).<br>
H(ai) = Hup(q) ■ Hea^Gi) ' HUo^)<br>
Although this transfer function also includes the transfer fimctions of both loudspeaker 120 and microphone 155, these can be chosen within predefined specifications leaving the transfer fimction of the ear as the characteristic part.<br>
The resulting transfer fimction iH((£&gt;)) is a complex entity. In a preferred embodiment, the characterizing means 160 discards delay and phase shift information and uses the amplitude of the transfer function as acoustical properties 165. The delay and phase shift information, and thereby some differentiating information, will be lost by using the an:5)litude of the transfer fimction. However, it is expected that this will result in a gain of robustness by reducing intra-class variation. The acoustical properties 165 can be used as a biometric feature vector in a method of authentication and identification.<br>
Although the apparatus depicted in Fig. 1 comprises both the loudspeaker 120 and the microphone 155, it is possible to partition the apparatus into two modules that can be separated during use, for example, an apparatus comprising a first module in the form of a wireless headset comprising both the loudspeaker 120 and the microphone 144, and a second module comprising a handheld device wherein the two modules are arranged to communicate with each other by means of a wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth using wireless communication means.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts a set of transfer fimctions \H((ii)\ 180,185,190, as established for three individuals characterized by using one piece of music. Fig. 2 is illustrative of the wealth of features present in the transfer fimctions. Each transfer fimction 180,185,190 shows characteristic peaks where a particular transfer fimction differs considerably from the other <br>
. t<br>
transfer fiinctions, thereby providing sufBcient opportunity to differentiate between these three persons.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts an apparatus 200 according to the second aspect of the present invention for characterizing a human outer ear 130.<br>
The apparatus 200 comprises a storage means, such as a memory conq)rising two representations of an audio signal, one comprising speech 110 and another comprising music 105. One of these representations is selected as a source signal; the selected source signal 115. The apparatus further comprises a noise generator 220, which is arranged to generate noise that can be added to the selected source signal 115. The resulting signal is a noisy selected source signal 225 that is used by Ifae apparatus 200 to generate a first acoustic signal 125. In order to generate the first acoustic signal, the ^paratus 200 comprises a loudspeaker 120.<br>
In one embodiment, the added noise is white noise that effectively increases the background noise of the selected source signal 115 in a uniform manner. In an alternative embodiment, the noise comprises colored noise with spectral components in the range of 100 Hz to 15 kHz, which are limited, or no spectral components in the selected source signal spectrum.<br>
In parallel with the transmission of the first acoustic signal, the microphone 155 receives a second acoustic signal 150. The microphone output 170 is sent to the characterizing means 245. The characterizing means 245 uses the microphone output 170 to characterize a transfer function which, at least in part, is based on the acoustical properties of the outer ear 130. In this embodiment, the acoustical properties are based on the noisy version of the selected source signal 225 and the output of the microphone 155.<br>
Although it is possible to add noise to the selected audio representation 115, it is also possible to perform this addition in the analog (electric), or even in the acoustic domain. Fig. 4 depicts an apparatus 300 in which tiie noise generator 220 is arranged as a source for a separate loudspeaker. Here, the first acoustic signal is effectively added in the acoustic domain by superposition of the signals 315 and 310.<br>
An apparatus for characterizing acoustical properties of an outer ear such as depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 resembles an apparatus for enrolment of acoustical properties of an outer ear of a person. Both characterize acoustical properties. However, in the case of enrolment, it is important to do so in a reliable maimer so as to facilitate a robust authentication or identification. Typically, an apparatus for enrohnent of acoustical properties will perform a series of characterizations, using a series of first acoustic signals.<br>
Subsequently, the results of the characterization process will be combined in order to obtain a more reliable characterization.<br>
Fig. 5 is a plot depicting the amplitude of two transfer ftmctions over . frequency characterized according to the present invention. The first transfer ftmction 580 is established while using music by means of an afq)aratus as shown in Fig. 1, whereas the second transfer fimction 590 was characterized while using music with added noise by means of an apparatus as shown in Fig. 3. This plot illustrates that by enhancing the first acoustic signal, by adding noise, the resulting transfer fimction will also be enhanced. This particular plot shows that the transfer fimction is emphasized for large parts of the spectrum, and in addition is "smootiied" over the entire audible spectrum.<br>
The inventors have found that the plication of a lossy audio compression algorithm is a particularly elegant method of adding noise to a music and/or speech signal. Lossy audio cortpression algorithms are typically based on a psycho-acoustic model of the human auditory system As the name suggests, lossy compression involves discarding information comprised in the original audio signal. The discarded information can also be considered as a noise signal added to the original audio content As a result, a lossy conpressed audio file, such as a file encoded by means of well-known audio compression standards such as MPEG audio layer 2 or 3, AAC, ATRAC, or WMA, may comprise large quantities of additional noise, albeit encoded in an inaudible fashion. In fact, the higher the compression ratio used during encoding, the larger the amount of additional noise. Consequently, when a lossy compressed audio signal is used for characterization, the added noise may benefit the characterization process.<br>
Although lossy compressed audio already provides additional noise, a fiirther improvement is possible. Fig. 6 depicts an apparatus 500 for authenticating a person by using previously enrolled acoustical properties. The apparatus 500 comprises various conponents also found in Fig. 3. The apparatus 500 fiirther coir^rises a noise generator control means 505 that analyzes the selected representation 115, and, based on a psycho-acoustic model of the human auditory system, determines the amount of noise that can be added, as well as the fi^quency band in which it has to be added to the selected representation 115 without causing audible distortions in the first acoustic signal 125.<br>
Apparatus 500 uses the same psycho-acoustic model of the human auditory system as is used in lossy digital audio compression, but the goal is different. The goal of a system applying lossy digital audio compression is to efl5ciently use a constrained number of bits to encode the audio signal while minimizing the perceived distortion. As a result, the<br>
lossy audio conpression algorithm will ibcus on the reduction of the number of frequency conponents that need to be encoded.<br>
In contrast, the present invention aims to add as much noise as possible to the first acoustic signal in order to optimize detection while minimizing the perceived distortion. A method according to the present invention does not have the bit-rate constraint found in a lossy audio conpression algorithm. As a result, the present invention has more freedom to add noise to the selected source signal. For example, it is typically advantageous for a method according to the present invention to add frequency components to the selected source signal where there are none present. In contrast, such an addition would clash with the bit-rate constraint in a lossy audio compression algorithm. The present invention can e?q)loit this additional freedom and optimize detection in an even more e£5cient ;^bion than a lossy audio compression algorithm can.<br>
The ^&gt;paratus 500 conprises a delay line 501 to allow temporal analysis of the selected representation 115 by the noise generator control means 505. The noise generator control means 505 sends a control signal to the noise generator 220 in order to control both amplitude and frequency characteristics of the noise generator output. In doing so, apparatus 500 can add noise in a hardly perceptible manner, exploiting both tenporal and spectral masking. The noise generated by the noise generator 220 is added to the delayed selected representation.<br>
The ^paratus 500 uses the resultant noisy audio representation 510 to generate a first acoustic signal 125 sent to the outer ear 130 by means of a loudspeaker 120. In parallel, a second acoustic signal 150 is acquired by means of a microphone 155. The microphone output is sent to a characterizing means 525. The characterizing means 525 establishes a transfer fiinction based on the noisy audio representation 510 and the output from the microphone 155. This transfer flmction can be used as, or in an alternative embodiment as a basis for, a feature vector 530. The resulting feature vector 530 is subsequently offered to the authentication means 540.<br>
The authentication means 540 uses an alleged identity 545, for example, entered by the person being authenticated, using a keyboard, or read from a badge reader. The alleged identity 545 is used to retrieve enrolled acoustical properties from a database 535 of enrolled acoustical properties. The retrieved acoustical properties are subsequently matched with those of the resulting feature vector 530. Provided a sufficient match is found within a pre-determined range, the authentication is said to be successful. It should be noted<br>
that an authentication decision may be either a hard decision or a soft decision. The use of soft decisions is particularly beneficial in multi-modal biometric authentication systems.<br>
To further improve the performance of the authentication system, well-known techniques such as Fischer Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be applied to characterize the most differentiating fi-equency components. To improve performance in a system applying Fischer LDA, the system for authenticating or identifying a person can enphasize those spectral components in the first acoustic signal that result in the most differentiating fi:equency components. Subsequently, the noise control generator means 505 will have to be configured so as to add as much signal energy as possible to these particular fiequency conponents in the first acoustic signal that result in the most differentiating fi^quency corr;)onents.<br>
The apparatus 500 depicted in Fig. 6 represents an apparatus for biometric authentication, whose general structure is not unlike that of an ^aratus for biometric identification. However, there is one main difference between these devices. In an apparatus for identification, a biometric is characterized and matched with, potentially, all entries in the reference database. In contrast, an apparatus for authentication typically only matches the established feature vector with the reference data associated with the alleged identity.<br>
Although the use of lossy audio compression in a characterization method may not result in optimal characterization, it does present a substantial improvement over a system that does not apply noise insertion. Fig. 7 depicts an alternative apparatus 595 for authenticating a person, using previously enrolled acoustical properties. In the apparatus 595, the delay line 501, the noise generator control means 505, the noise generator 220, and the adder found in apparatus 500 (Fig. 6) have been replaced by alternative means that perform a similar fimction.<br>
In the apparatus 595, the selected source signal 115 is sent to a lossy audio coii5)ression encoder 591. This encoder comprises a processor executing a lossy audio con:5)ression algorithm, or parts of such an algorithm as described below. The lossy conpressed audio signal 592, output by the lossy audio compression encoder 591, is sent to a lossy audio conpression decoder 593. The decoder 593 comprises a processor for executing the accompanying audio decompression algorithm, or parts thereof. The combination of both the lossy encoding and subsequent decoding results in a noisy audio representation 510 with minimal audible distortioa<br>
A typical lossy audio conpression encoder comprises three stages: A transformation stage<br>
llie mput signal is transtormecL.<br>
2.	A quantization stage<br>
Signal analysis and quantization are handled in this stage. As a result, this stage is the primary cause of the loss of information (added noise).<br>
3.	An encoding stage<br>
Conventional entropy encoding techniques are used to generate a more concise representation of the quantized data.<br>
The accompanying lossy audio compression decoder typically comprises stages that effectively mirror the encoder stages:<br>
1.	A decoding stage<br>
The encoded data is decoded by using conventional entropy decoding<br>
techniques.<br>
2.	A reconstruction stage<br>
An approximation of the transformed representation is reconstructed by means of the decoded data.<br>
3.	A transformation stage<br>
The transformed representation is transformed back into a signal resembling the original input signal.<br>
In the present embodiment, the encoder and the decoder are placed back-to- back. This allows further optimization of the encoder and decoder. One important optimization is the removal of the encoding and decoding stages. Further optimizations are possible, depending on the actual algorithm applied. The resultant audio processing module 594 will perform the same ftinction but will do so in a more efficient manner.<br>
Fig. 8 depicts a system 600 according to the present invention. The system conprises an apparatus 605 for enrolment of acoustical properties of a person's outer ear. The apparatus 605 is used to characterize the acoustical properties of an outer ear 601, using a first acoustic signal 602 comprising music and/or speech. The apparatus 605 receives a second acoustic signal 603 and uses this to characterize acoustical properties related to the outer ear 601 that are subsequently stored in a database 610.<br>
The system fiirther includes an apparatus 625 for identification of a person, using acoustical properties of an outer ear. When a person is present at the apparatus 625 that needs to be identified, the apparatus 625 supplies a first acoustic signal 622 comprising music and/or speech. The first acoustic signal 622 is transmitted towards the outer ear 621 of the person being identified. The apparatus 625 receives a second signal 623 and uses this to characterize acoustical properties of the outer ear 621. The characterized acoustical properties are subsequently matched with enrolled acoustical properties from the database 610. When the difference is within a predetermined threshold, a match is found and the identity is established as being the identity associated with the database entry.<br>
To match acoustical properties, data is sent from the database 610 to tiie apparatus 625 via a network 615. This network may be a GSM network, a UMTS network, a wireless LAN, a proprietary network, or even the Internet. To prevent excessive data transfers, the database may be distributed, or alternatively, the matching process may be centralized at one or multiple sites in the network.<br>
Although the q^&gt;aratus 605 and the ^aratus 625 may be dedicated devices, the present invention can also be incorporated in existing or future consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, DECT phones, regular phones, or other devices such as portable audio and/or video players that comprise earphones, or headphones.<br>
Fig. 9 depicts a teleconmiunication system 700 configured to provide telecommunication services via a network and allow remote authentication of a person, using acoustical properties of an outer ear. The depicted system comprises at least two terminals; the first terminal 701 is the terminal that performs the actual authentication, the second terminal 702 in turn establishes the acoustical properties of the person 705 who is being authenticated. Although the depicted first terminal 701 is structurally similar to the second terminal 702, this is not necessary. In an alternative embodiment, the first terminal 701 may be e.g. a computer system operated by a service provider arranged to automatically answer orders placed by telephone.<br>
The actual authentication process is distributed through both terminals. The first terminal 701 provides a representation 720 of an audio signal comprising music and/or speech. This representation 720 can be pre-recorded or created on-the-fly by the first terminal 701, e.g. by sampling the voice of the operator 703 of the first terminal 701. The representation 720 is subsequently transmitted to the second terminal 702 via a network 725. In the second terminal, noise is added to the incoming signal according to the present invention. This noisy representation is converted into a first zicoustic signal 730 by the second terminal 702, using a loudspeaker 120.<br>
The second teiminal 702 further receives a second acoustic signal 735. The second acoustic signal 735 conqjrises reflected parts of the first acoustic signal 730. These parts are reflected by an outer ear 706 of the person 705 operating the second tenninal 702. The signal registered by the microphone 155 is used together with the noisy representation in<br>
the characterizing means 770 to derive characterized acoustical properties 750. The characterized acoustical properties 750 are transmitted to the first terminal 701 via the network 725.<br>
The first terminal 701 comprises an authentication means 755. The authentication means 755 obtains an alleged identity 545. The alleged identity 545 may be e.g. communicated by tiie person being authenticated to the first terminal, or may be obtained by using a card reader. Using tiie alleged identity 545, the authentication means obtains enrolled acoustical properties associated with the alleged identity 545 from the database 760. Subsequently, the authentication means 755 matches the characterized acoustical properties 750 with these enrolled acoustical properties. The person operating the second terminal 702 is authenticated when a sufficient match is found with the enrolled acoustical properties associated with the alleged identity 545, otherwise authentication fails.<br>
The network used in system 725 may be a GPS network, a UMTS network, a 802.11 wireless LAN, a proprietary network, or a TCP/IP network. The system 700 can be used to remotely authenticate persons, e.g. to grant them access to services on a network, to content available through the network, or it may be used to authorize transactions, e.g. in order to allow electronic banking.<br>
Although the system 700 depicted in Fig. 9 is partitioned in an efficient manner, it is possible to distribute functionality from the second terminal 702 to the first terminal 701. This is relevant when there is limited control of the integrity of the second terminal 702. In this scenario, it is interesting to move the characterizing means from the second terminal 702 to the first terminal 701. However, although certain networks such as a TCP/IP network allow transparent data transmission, other networks such as GSM networks may not be transparent for audio signals. As a result, re-distribution of fianctionality may not always be feasible.<br>
Apart from the above-mentioned embodiments, the present invention can also be applied in consumer electronics devices such as audio and/or video playback devices utilizing headphones, or earphones. Here, the present invention can be used to identify a user and customize e.g. equalizer settings, or program offers based on the user identity.<br>
Alternatively, a mobile phone, or an alternative device comprising earphones or headphones may be assigned exclusively to one or more particular users. In doing so, the present invention would allow an efficient thefl-deterrent/abuse-prevention system for said consumer electronics device.<br>
, Ji<br>
The present invention can allow the authentication of users with or without knowledge of said users, e.g. for allowing automatic priority scheduling in a telephone queue.<br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims.<br>
In the claims, any reference signs placed between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claim. Use of the verb "comprise" and its conjugations does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those stated in a claim. Use of the article "a" or "an" preceding an element or step does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements or steps.<br>
The invention can be implemented by means of hardware comprising several distinct elements, and by means of a suitably programmed computer. In the device claim enumerating several means, several of these means can be embodied by one and the same item of hardware. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.<br>
