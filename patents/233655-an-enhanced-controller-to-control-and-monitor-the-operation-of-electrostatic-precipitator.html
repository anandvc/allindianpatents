				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), which is a<br>
dust-collection equipment widely used in thermal plants, cement plants, steel<br>
plants, sugar plants etc., and having electronic controllers for control and<br>
monitoring of its operation. In particular, the invention relates to the electronic<br>
controller for a controlled operation of the high voltage transformer rectifier and<br>
the rapping motor, which are all controllable parts of ESP. Also, the invention<br>
relates to the electronic controller for on-line monitoring and sharing of operating<br>
status with peer controllers to have coordinated operation of ESP by adapting an<br>
open-standard multi-master communication protocol interface.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The electrostatic precipitators (ESP) are basically segmented into number of<br>
electrical fields depending upon the size. Each field consists of a collecting and<br>
emitting electrode system pair with collecting electrode at negative polarity and<br>
emitting at positive polarity typically. The field is electrically energized by applying<br>
high voltage between positive and negative electrodes using a high voltage<br>
power supply system. The applied voltage produces necessary high electric field<br>
and electrostatic forces between electrodes, which ionizes and charges dust<br>
particles when pass between the electrodes and collected in the surface of the<br>
electrodes with opposite polarity. Typically, collected dust is removed from the<br>
electrodes by a tumbling hammed based rapping mechanism driven by rapping<br>
motors. Each of the fields of ESP needs to be individually controlled with respect<br>
to applying high voltage and rapping system.<br>
Normally high voltage power supply and rapping motors of fields of ESP are<br>
controlled and monitored by a plurality of micro-controller based controllers. The<br>
micro-controller based controllers are connected through a data communication<br>
bus and often controlled from a remote controller or a central controller. Normally<br><br>
the micro-controller based controllers are slave controllers, wherein the remote<br>
controller or the central controllers are master controllers. The remote /central<br>
computer is responsible for the overall performance of the ESP.<br>
In the prior art, mechanism exists to control the high voltage power supply<br>
individually for each field through electronic controller. Also, the rapping motors<br>
are controlled by a separate electronic controller. However, no mechanism exists<br>
to control and monitor each ESP field in complete using a single common<br>
electronic controller by controlling both high voltage power supply and rapping<br>
motors. This method also enhances efficiency of ESP by synchronizing<br>
energization and rapping system.<br>
The position of each field with respect to gas flow direction, decides the amount<br>
of dust collected in that field. Fields facing gas flow early is set to collect more<br>
dust. Any failures of a field will immediately need to be communicated to the<br>
subsequent fields to adjust to new load input to those fields so that they can<br>
adjust their control parameters to maintain desired efficiency of ESP. In the prior<br>
art mechanism exist to connect all electronic controllers through communication<br>
network in master-slave mechanism, where the slave will have to wait for its turn<br>
for communication with master. Also, mechanism do exists, that the<br>
communication is provided with proprietary communication protocol over different<br>
physical layer topologies including RS-485 and current loop communication.<br>
But, no mechanism exist, where all electronic controllers are interfaced in<br>
MASTER-MASTER (multi-master) mechanism. This will enable faster<br>
communication between peers of electronic controllers and subsequently making<br>
ESP responding to the changes in field conditions quickly thereby increasing its<br>
effectiveness. Also, no mechanism exists, where such communication interfaces<br>
are provided with open-standard communication protocol. This will enable for any<br>
third-party system to interact with electronic controller directly.<br><br>
Also, no mechanism exists, where the electronic controllers are equipped with<br>
reading boiler-load and opacity signals directly and communicate them among<br>
peers thereby avoiding a third-party system like central computer to those<br>
signals.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an enhanced controller for control and<br>
monitoring of both power supply unit and rapper motors of ESP field for<br>
synchronized operation for improving collection efficiency.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a master-master (multi-<br>
master) communication mechanism between electronic controllers for speedy<br>
communication of field data between peers so that they adjust to field changes<br>
immediately.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a communication interface<br>
between peers using open-standard communication protocol so that any third-<br>
party systems can interact with electronic controller.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to enable electronic controller to read<br>
plant data like boiler-load and opacity signal and communicate to peers for any<br>
coordinated operation of ESP.<br>
And yet another object of the invention is to propose an enhanced controller in an<br>
electrostatic precipitator, which reduces the optimization time and responds<br>
quickly on variation of field parameters.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
In the invented enhanced controller both the power supply control and rapper<br>
motor control functionalities are integrated in a single system. Also additional<br>
signals like boiler load and opacity signals are monitored in the invented<br>
controller. In order to share the operating parameters among other controllers<br>
communication interface is provided in the enhanced controller. In the invented<br>
enhanced controller an open standard multi-master communication protocol,<br>
Controller Area Network (CAN), is adopted for communicating with other<br>
controllers. In multi-master communication protocol any controller can initiate the<br>
communication. Data sharing is also possible, which enable implementation of<br>
coordinated operation schemes with-in the controller itself. This invention<br>
includes implementation of hardware and software in the aforesaid controller<br>
using STANDALONE CAN controller and CAN transceiver.<br>
The enhanced controller for control and monitoring of ESP field is developed<br>
based on embedded hardware. It comprises a hardware part and a software part.<br>
The hardware is based on 16 Bit micro-controller, memory devices, peripheral<br>
devices and Controller Area Network (CAN) communication devices. The 16-bit<br>
micro-controller enables and controls all other devices. The software part is<br>
stored in the memory. Peripheral devices interface the field signals to the micro-<br>
controller. Communication devices interface the processor with the Controller<br>
Area Network (CAN) communication physical bus. The CAN communication<br>
physical bus connects a plurality of controllers in a large plant.<br>
