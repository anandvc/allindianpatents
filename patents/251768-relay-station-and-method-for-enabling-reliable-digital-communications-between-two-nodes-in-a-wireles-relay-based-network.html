				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to the telecommunications field and, in<br>
particular, to a relay station and method for enabling reliable digital communications to occur<br>
between two nodes in a wireless relay based network.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Manufacturers and operators of wireless relay based networks are constantly trying to<br>
develop new ways to improve the reliability of digital communications transmitted between<br>
two nodes. The traditional wireless relay based networks described below each include one<br>
station (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital communications to<br>
another station (node B) via one or more relay stations (RSs). The relay station can be part of<br>
a base station (BS), a mobile station (MS) or a stand-alone relay station. The nodes A and B<br>
can be a BS, a MS and/or a relay station. And, the digital communications could be either<br>
uplink communications (link from MS to BS), downlink communications (link from BS to<br>
MS), MS to MS communications or BS to BS communications. Examples of different<br>
traditional wireless relay based networks and some of their respective drawbacks are briefly<br>
discussed below with respect to FIGURES 1-5.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of a traditional<br>
wireless relay based network 100. The wireless relay based network 100 includes a first node<br>
102 (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital communications to a<br>
second node 104 (node B) via one relay station 106. As shown, the first node 102 transmits a<br>
channel coded and modulated signal So(t) over a first link 108 that has a complex channel<br>
coefficient h0 such that So(t) is received at relay station 106 as R1(t)=h0*S0(t)+n1(t), where<br>
ni(t) is a noise sequence. The relay station 106 is a repeater that generate a signal S1(t) which<br>
is an amplified version of the received sequence and is shown as S1(t)=A*R1(t). The relay<br>
station 106 then transmits the generated signal Si(t) over a second link 110 that has a complex<br>
channel coefficient h1 such that S1(t) is received at the second node 104 as<br><br>
R2(t)=h1*S1(t)+n2(t), where n2(t) is a noise sequence. There are several drawbacks associated<br>
with this type of wireless relay based network 100. First, the amplification of R1(t) at relay<br>
station 106 amplifies not only the signal R1(t) but also the noise n1(t) caused by the first link<br>
108. Secondly, the relay station 106 is not very efficient when it amplifies R1(t) since there is<br>
a large amount of redundancy in So(t) due to channel coding.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of another<br>
traditional wireless relay based network 200. The wireless relay based network 200 includes<br>
a first node 202 (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital<br>
communications to a second node 204 (node B) via one relay station 206. As shown, the first<br>
node 202 transmits a channel coded and modulated signal So(t) over a first link 208 that has a<br>
complex channel coefficient ho such that So(t) is received at relay station 206 as<br>
R1(t)=h0*So(t)+n1(t), where ni(t) is a noise sequence. The relay station 206 then decodes, re-<br>
encodes, re-modulates and transmits a signal S1(t)=Al*Soest(t) over a second link 210 that has<br>
a complex channel coefficient h1 which is received at the second node 204. This is a good<br>
solution whenever the relay station 206 makes a correct decision when it estimates and re-<br>
encodes So(t). However, when the relay station 206 makes an incorrect decision, the second<br>
link 210 further propagates the information errors and increases the bit error rate of the signal<br>
Si(t) transmitted to second node 204.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of yet another<br>
traditional wireless relay based network 300. The wireless relay based network 300 includes<br>
a first node 302 (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital<br>
communications to a second node 304 (node B) via one relay station 306. As shown, the first<br>
node 302 transmits a channel coded and modulated signal So(t) over a first link 308 that has a<br>
complex channel coefficient ho such that So(t) is received at relay station 306 as<br>
R1(t)=ho*So(t)+n1(t), where n1(t) is a noise sequence. The relay station 306 then decodes, re-<br>
encodes, re-modulates, amplifies and transmits a signal S1(t) over a second link 310 that has a<br>
complex channel coefficient h1 which is received at the second node 304. In this example, the<br>
relay station 306 checks the correctness of the decoding of So(t) using for example a cyclic<br>
redundancy check (CRC) and only re-generates, re-modulates and transmits S1(t)=Al*So(t) in<br>
case of correctness, otherwise the relay station 306 simply amplifies and retransmits the<br><br>
received signal as S1(t)=A2*R1(t). This solution is problematic since the relay station 306<br>
needs to make a hard decision on the information symbols in S1(t) instead of having the<br>
second node 304 make that hard decision. It is well known that in a communication chain it is<br>
advantageous not to make hard decisions until late as possible in the chain. As described<br>
below in detail there are some known ways to avoid making hard decisions in relay stations<br>
which include using a second relay path or using an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 4 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of yet another<br>
traditional wireless relay based network 400. The wireless relay based network 400 includes<br>
a first node 402 (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital<br>
communications to a second node 404 (node B) via one relay station 406. As shown, the first<br>
node 402 transmits a channel coded and modulated signal So(t) over a first link 408 that has a<br>
complex channel coefficient ho to relay station 406. The relay station 406 then transmits<br>
S1(t)=Q(R1(t)) which is a quantized base band representation of R1(t) over a second link 410<br>
that has a complex channel coefficient h1 to the second node 404. In this solution, the second<br>
link 410 generally has a larger bandwidth and uses a different air interface protocol than the<br>
first link 408. This solution is problematic in that the quantized base band signal S1(t)<br>
contains a large amount of data about phase and noise that does not necessarily need to be<br>
sent to the second node 404.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of a traditional<br>
wireless relay based network 500. The wireless relay based network 500 includes a first node<br>
502 (node A) that transmits information in coded and modulated digital communications to a<br>
second node 504 (node B) via two relay stations 506a and 506b. As shown, the first node 502<br>
transmits a channel coded and modulated signal So(t) over a link 508a that has a complex<br>
channel coefficient ho to relay station 506a. At the same time, the first node 502 also<br>
transmits So(t) over a link 508b that has a complex channel coefficient ho to relay station<br>
506b. The relay stations 506a and 506b know or can estimate their respective channel<br>
coefficients ho, ho, h1 and h1 on links 508a, 508b, 510a and 510b. As such, relay station 506a<br>
can transmit S1(t)=A*conj(h0)*conj(h1)*R1(t) over link 510a to the second node 504. And,<br>
relay station 506b can transmit S1(t)=A*conj(h0)*conj(h1)*R1(t) over link 510b to the second<br>
node 504. As is well known the signals R1(t) and R1(t) because of the scaling and phase<br><br>
shifts involved can be added coherently in a maximum ratio combining sense when they are<br>
received at the second node 504. This scheme can be extended to three or more relay paths.<br>
Even with multiple relay paths there is still a reliability problem since each relay station 506a<br>
and 506b may make a different decision in decoding signals R1(t) and R1(t) which makes it<br>
difficult for the second node 504 to coherently combine signals S1(t) and S1(t). One possible<br>
solution when there are multiple relay paths is for each relay station 506a and 506b to check<br>
an error detecting outer code in signals R1(t) and R1(t). If either R1(t) and/or R1(t) checks out<br>
OK then the respective relay station 506a and/or 506b transmits the corresponding S1(t)<br>
and/or S1(t), otherwise the respective relay station 506a and/or 506b does not send anything<br>
or they can send an amplified version of the respective received signal(s). The problem with<br>
this solution is that it relies on the following assumptions that (1) at least one relay station<br>
506a or 506b has correctly decoded signal R1(t) and R1(t) and (2) that the corresponding<br>
second link 510a or 510b for such relay station 506a or 506b is sufficiently good to enable the<br>
decoding of signals S1(t) or S1(t). Accordingly, there is a need for a new signal processing<br>
solution that can be implemented in a relay station which addresses the aforementioned<br>
shortcomings and other shortcomings of the traditional wireless relay based networks 100,<br>
200, 300, 400 and 500. This need and other needs are satisfied by the wireless relay based<br>
network and relay station of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCR1PTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
ReferR1ng to FIGURES 6 and 7A, there are disclosed preferred embodiments of a<br>
wireless relay based network 600 and method 700 in accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
The wireless relay based network 600 includes a first node 602 (node A) that transmits<br>
information in coded and modulated digital communications to a second node 604 (node B)<br>
via a relay station 606. Like the traditional wireless relay based networks 100, 200, 300, 400<br>
and 500 shown in FIGURES 1-5, the relay station 606 can be part of a BS, MS or a stand-<br>
alone relay station. The first node 602 and the second node 604 can be a BS, a MS and/or a<br>
relay station. And, the digital communications could be either uplink communications (link<br>
from MS to BS), downlink communications (link from BS to MS), MS to MS<br>
communications or BS to BS communications. However, the relay station 606 of the present<br>
invention has a functionality shown in method 700 that is a marked improvement over the<br>
functionalities of the traditional relay stations 106, 206, 306, 406 and 506 descR1bed above<br>
with respect to the traditional wireless relay based networks 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500.<br>
The relay station 606 basically enables information to be reliably transmitted between<br>
the first node 602 and the second node 604 by receiving (step 702) a coded and modulated<br>
digital communication 607a which was transmitted from the first node 602 over a wireless<br>
link 608 that has a complex channel coefficient h0 The relay station 606 then computes (step<br>
704) a plurality of reliability values for a plurality of symbols in the received digital<br>
communication 607a (R1(t)). There are many ways of which two are descR1bed in detail<br>
below as to how the relay station 606 can compute the reliability values for the symbols in the<br>
received digital communication 607a.<br>
In the first way, the relay station 606 utilizes a maximum a posteoR1 (MAP) filter<br>
612a to compute the reliability values for code symbols based on a code structure of the<br>
received coded digital communication 607a. For more details about the MAP filter 612a<br>
reference is made to the following articles all of which are incorporated by reference herein:<br>
•	J. Lodge et al. "Separable MAP "filters" for the Decoding of Product and<br>
Concatenated Codes" Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on<br>
Communication, pp 1740-1745, 1993.*<br>
•	I. Land et al. "On the Interpretation of the APP AlgoR1thm as an LLR Filter"<br>
ISIT 2000, Sorrento, Italy, June 25-30, 2000.*<br><br>
* It should be noted that in the literature the acronym MAP (maximum a posteR1oR1) can be<br>
called APP (a posteR1oR1 probability, Log-APP or Max-log-APP.<br>
FIGURE 7B is a diagram showing how a Log-APP filter 612a can implement an APP<br>
algoR1thm that helps perform steps 702, 704 and 706 in the method 700. It should be<br>
appreciated that the notation used herein is the same notation as used in Land et al. where the<br>
log-likelihood values for the code symbols are denoted by L(X) and the log-likelihood values<br>
for the information symbols are denoted by L(U) with superscR1pts + or - depending if the<br>
corresponding reliabilities are considered before (-) or after (+) the Log-APP filter 612a.<br>
The log-likelihood value L(X) for a binary code symbol X is In (P(X=+1 | received<br>
data) / P(X=-1 I received data))(see Land et al.) As such, it follows that equally probable<br>
symbols then have log-likelihood value (L-value) of zero and a highly likely '+1' have a large<br>
positive L-value, and conversely a highly likely '-1' have a large negative L-value. Most<br>
often the information symbols are equally likely from the receivers perspective before<br>
processing, hence L(U")=0 is often assumed which further simplifies the calculations in the<br>
Log-APP filter 612a. After processing the updated L(X+) and/or L(U+) these values can be<br>
embedded into transmitted radio signal (see step 706 in FIGURE 7A). In the most basic and<br>
preferred form either information or code symbol reliabilities are embedded, but of course<br>
they can be combined as well. If only code symbol reliabilities are to be used, of course the<br>
reliability calculator (Log-APP in the example) need not calculate information reliabilities or<br>
vice versa. FIGURE 7B shows the case where all information is used in the most general<br>
form.<br>
The Log-APP filter 612a can be interpreted as using the code structure to 'amplify' the<br>
reliability and the more amplification there is the more reliable the symbols are up to a limit<br>
decided by the code parameters. If only L(X") and L(X+) are used then the Log-APP filter<br>
612a can be seen as a very non-linear log likelihood filter which outputs values in the same<br>
domain with the same type of values and code symbols as the output but with an improved<br>
signal to noise ratio. It should be appreciated that since the input and outputs are of the same<br>
form (L(U) and/or L(X)) then in some cases, after a first application of the APP algoR1thm that<br><br>
the output L(X+) can be connected to the input L(X-) and the APP algoR1thm can be run again<br>
with these new values as input. The same follows for L(U)-values.<br>
An additional functionality and advantage of using the Log-APP filter 612a shown in<br>
FIGURE 7B is that it makes use of the redundancy and structure of the channel code in the<br>
received digital communication 607a to clean-up or filter that digital communication 607a and<br>
redistR1bute noise to unreliable parts in the digital communication 607b (S1(t)) transmitted to<br>
the second node 604. It should be appreciated that the Log-App filter 612a does not<br>
necessaR1ly regenerate a valid code word but computes a code symbol by code symbol<br>
reliability value.<br>
In the second way, the relay station 606 utilizes a soft output channel decoder 612b to<br>
compute the reliability values for information symbols based on a code structure of the<br>
received coded digital communication 607a. To accomplish this, the soft output channel<br>
decoder 612b can employ for example: (1) a maximum a posteR1oR1 (MAP) algorithm; (2) a<br>
soft output Viterbi algoR1thm (SOVA); (3) a Log-MAP algoR1thm; or (4) a Max-LOG-MAP<br>
algoR1thm. For more details about the soft output channel decoders 612b reference is made to<br>
the following articles all of which are incorporated by reference herein:<br>
•	P. Robertson et al. "Optimal and Sub-Optimal Maximum a Posteriori Algorithms<br>
Suitable for Turbo Decoding" European Transaction on Telecommunications (ETT),<br>
Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 1-16, 1997.<br>
•	J. Hagenauer et al. "A Viterbi Algorithm with Soft-Decision Outputs and its<br>
Applications" IEEE Globecom, pp. 1680-1686, 1989.<br>
The reliability values that are computed for the code symbols or information symbols<br>
could have anyone of a wide variety of formats. For example, a binary '1' symbol could have<br>
a reliability value +1.0 if there is a 100% certainty of a T. And, a binary '0' symbol could<br>
have a reliability value -1.0 if there is a 100% certainty of a binary '0'. Moreover, the<br>
reliability value can be 0.0 if the bit is completely unreliable (T and '0' equally probable). In<br>
another example, a reliability value of+0.2 could indicate that a binary T symbol is more<br><br>
likely to be correct but a +0.8 would indicate an even stronger conviction of a binary '1'<br>
symbol. It should be appreciated that there could be more possible reliability values than<br>
symbols in order to be able to exploit 'soft' information. For example, a reliability value of<br>
{+1.0, 0, -1.0} could denote three possible reliabilities for two symbols '0' and T. In another<br>
example, a reliability value of {+1.0, +0.5, +0.2, 0, -0.2, -0.5, -1.0} could denote seven<br>
possible reliability values for '0' and '1' symbols and also provide a better resolution. The<br>
seven possible reliability values could be represented by a 3-bit code.<br>
After the relay station 606 computes reliability values for either the code symbols or<br>
information symbols within the received digital communication 607a, the relay station 606<br>
then transmits (step 706) a coded and modulated digital communication 607b that has the<br>
computed reliability values embedded therein over a wireless link 614 which has a complex<br>
channel coefficient h1 to the second node 604. There are a vaR1ety of ways for embedding the<br>
reliability values in the transmitted digital communication 607b (S1(t)). For example, the<br>
reliability values can be explicitly embedded into the transmitted coded digital<br>
communication 607b by actually transmitting data representing those reliability values. In<br>
another example, the reliability values can be implicitly embedded into the transmitted digital<br>
communication 607b by using the reliability values to modulate the amplitude (and/or phase)<br>
of the transmitted digital communication 607b. Several different examples are descR1bed<br>
below on how the reliability values can be embedded into the transmitted digital<br>
communication 607b.<br>
Example #1: The reliability values can actually be embedded in the transmitted digital<br>
communication 607b if one increases the bandwidth or bitrate of the transmitted digital<br>
communication 607b. And, instead of transmitting reliability values of'0' or '1' which takes a<br>
single bit one could get a better resolution by tripling the bit rate and transmitting three bits<br>
denoting one of seven reliability values {+1.0, +0.5, +0.2, 0, -0.2, -0.5, -1.0} for each of the<br>
symbols in the digital communication 607b. In this example, the relay station 606 would act<br>
as a supportive processing element for the second node 604 (e.g., user terminal). This option<br>
is especially attractive if the wireless relay based network has a very high capacity second link<br>
610 like the ones shown in FIGURE 9.<br><br>
Example #2: If multiple reliability values {+1.0, +0.5, +0.2, 0, -0.2, -0.5, -1.0} for each of the<br>
symbols are embedded in the transmitted digital communication 607b, then something has to<br>
be increased like the bandwidth as descR1bed in example #1. Another option is to increase the<br>
size of the signal constellation from 2 to 8 (for example) to embed multiple reliability values<br>
associated with each symbol in the transmitted digital communication 607b. For example, a<br>
binary phase shift key (BPSK) may be used when two reliability values for each symbol are<br>
embedded in the transmitted digital communication 607b. If there are seven reliability values<br>
as described in example #1 then 8-PSK is an option.<br>
Example #3: To implicitly transmit reliability values one can use different signal constellation<br>
sizes (modulation schemes) for symbols with different reliabilities such that more energy per<br>
symbol is spent on the reliable symbols in the transmitted digital communication 607b.<br>
Example #4: One could generate the transmitted digital communication 607b and modulate it<br>
using the reliability values for the corresponding bits in the digital communication 607b. For<br>
example, one can amplitude modulate the transmitted digital communication 607b with the<br>
reliability of symbol at time t, REL(t) and transmit the coded digital communication 607b<br>
(e.g., S2(t)=REL(t)*Si(t)). In this case, the reliable parts of the digital communication 607b<br>
are transmitted with higher power than the low reliability parts of the digital communication<br>
607b. This is done because there is no reason to waste energy on already unreliable bits since<br>
the reliability of a bit can only decrease in the transmission chain.<br>
Example #5: The reliable parts of the digital communication 607b could use a longer signal<br>
time occupation signal than the one for unreliable parts. This is another way of ensuring that<br>
reliable parts are transmitted with higher total energy. An advantage of this example when<br>
compared to example #4 is that the amplitude of the transmitted digital communication 607b<br>
is now constant which is sometimes desirable. It should be appreciated that any modulation<br>
scheme (amplitude modulation, phase modulation) implies an expansion of the bandwidth on<br>
the link 610 to the second node 604.<br><br>
Again, it should be appreciated that there are other ways that are known or can be<br>
subsequently developed which can be used to embed reliability values into the transmitted<br>
digital communication 607b in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 8, there is shown a block diagram of another embodiment of a<br>
wireless relay based network 800 in accordance with the present invention. The wireless<br>
relay based network 800 includes a first node 802 that transmits information in coded and<br>
modulated digital communications to a second node 804 via two relay stations 806a and 806b.<br>
As shown, the first node 802 transmits a channel coded and modulated signal 807a (So(t))<br>
over link 808a that has a complex channel coefficient ho to relay station 806a. At the same<br>
time, the first node 802 also transmits digital communication 808a' (So(t)) over a link 808a'<br>
that has a complex channel coefficient ho to relay station 806b. The relay stations 806a and<br>
806b respectively perform the signal processing associated with method 700 and transmit<br>
digital communications 807b and 807b' over links 810a and 810a' to the second node 804.<br>
The second node 804 then coherently combines the two digital communications 807b and<br>
807b' with only a small risk of propagating errors. This scheme can be extended to three or<br>
more relay paths.<br>
In an one embodiment of the wireless relay based network 800, the relay stations 806a<br>
and 806b can be configured like example #4 and transmit high reliability symbols with higher<br>
power and low reliability symbols with smaller power in the digital communications 807b and<br>
807b' which enables the second node 804 to combine them in a less risky manner since the<br>
erroneous symbols are likely to have a small reliability. Furthermore, it is likely in this<br>
embodiment that a less reliable portion of the received digital communication 807b from one<br>
relay station 806a (for example) would be matched by more reliable symbols in the digital<br>
communication 807b' from another relay station 806b (for example).<br>
In another embodiment of the wireless relay based network 800, the relay stations<br>
806a and 806b know or can estimate the channel responses h0 ho, h1 or h1 on any of the links<br>
808a, 808a', 810a and 810a' but on at least the second links 810b and 810b'. As such, one<br>
relay station 806a to construct a digital communication 807b that can be coherently combined<br><br>
at the second node 804 with a similar digital communication 807b' constructed by another<br>
relay station 806b. This is like the traditional wireless relay based network 500 shown in<br>
FIGURE 5 except that the relay stations 806a and 806b perform better using the advanced<br>
signal processing of the present invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that the relay station 806a (for example) can estimate the<br>
channel coefficient ho on the first link 808a if a known pilot symbol is transmitted together<br>
with the data in the digital communication 807a to relay station 806a. In this case, the<br>
channel coefficient ho can then be estimated by comparing the received corrupted pilot with<br>
the known pilot signal. The channel coefficient ho is then the same also for the data. In<br>
contrast, the relay station 806a (for example) has to know the channel coefficient h1 in<br>
advance of the transmission of the digital communication 807b to the second node 804. This<br>
is possible if the channel coefficient h1 is sufficiently slowly changing and there is some form<br>
of feedback between the relay station 806a and the second node 804. It could be that the<br>
second node 806a measures the channel coefficient h1 using the pilot method described above<br>
and then sends back information about h1 to relay station 806a with the hope that it will be the<br>
same (or close to) when it is time to transmit the next digital communication 807b. Another<br>
possibility is that there is also a link (not shown) from the second node 804 to the relay station<br>
806a, and that both links use the same frequency band separated in time (TDD=time division<br>
duplex). In this case, any traffic in the direction from the second node 804 to relay station<br>
806a experiences the same or almost the same channel coefficient h1 as the traffic in the<br>
direction from the relay station 806a to the second node 804. Hence, the relay station 806a<br>
can estimate the channel coefficient h1 in the direction from the second node 804 to relay<br>
station 806a and assume it to be the same in the other direction.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 9, there is shown a block diagram of yet another embodiment of<br>
a wireless relay based network 900 in accordance with the present invention. The wireless<br>
relay based network 900 includes a first node 902 that transmits information in coded and<br>
modulated digital communications to a second node 904 via two relay stations 906a and 906b.<br>
As shown, the first node 902 respectively transmits two channel coded and modulated signals<br>
907a and 907a' (S0(t)) over two links 908a and 908a' to two relay stations 906a and 906b. The<br>
relay stations 906a and 906b then transmit coded and modulated digital communications 907b<br><br>
and 907b' (S1(t) and S1(t)) over two links 910a and 910a' to the second node 904. As can be<br>
seen, the second links 910a and 910a' have a larger bandwidth (higher bit rate) and may use a<br>
different air interface protocol than the first links 908a and 908a' in order to carry quantized<br>
reliability information about the code or information symbols and possibly channel amplitude<br>
and phase information from the relay stations 906a and 906b to the second node 904. This<br>
configuration is especially useful if the second node 904 is an MS because then the relay<br>
stations 906a and 906b can be seen as a wirelessly connected antenna system which enhances<br>
the reception at the second node 904. Another advantage of this set-up is that the antennas at<br>
the relay stations 906a and 906b could be spaced further apart and still enable virtual antenna<br>
diversity at the second node 904 (MS 904). In addition, the relay stations 906a and 906b<br>
could be multiple antenna/MIMO systems so that a second node 904 (MS 904) which has a<br>
low complexity could make use of method 700 of the present invention where part of the<br>
signal processing can be done in the relay stations 906a and 906b and part of it in the second<br>
node 904 (MS 904).<br>
Referring to FIGURE 10, there is shown a block diagram of yet another embodiment<br>
of a wireless relay based network 1000 in accordance with the present invention. The<br>
wireless relay based network 1000 includes a first node 1002 that transmits information in<br>
coded and modulated digital communication 1007a and 1007b to a second node 1004 via one<br>
relay station 1006. If the second node 1004 is able to decode the digital communication<br>
1007b which is generated and transmitted from the relay station 1006 then it sends an<br>
acknowledgement message (ACK)(not shown) to the first node 1002. And, if the second<br>
node 1004 is not able to decode the digital communication 1007b then it sends a negative<br>
acknowledgment message (NAK) 1009 to the first node 1002. If the NAK 1009 is<br>
transmitted, then the first node 1002 transmits another digital communication 1007a' which is<br>
processed by the relay station 1006 and transmitted as digital communication 1007b' to the<br>
second node 1004. The second node 1004 then attempts to combine the two versions of the<br>
digital communication 1007b and 1007b'. Thus, if only one relay path is available between<br>
the first node 1002 and the second node 1004 then there is still a way to combine several<br>
temporally differentiated versions of the digital communication 1007b and 1007b' assuming<br>
there is an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, an incremental redundancy ARQ<br>
protocol or a similar protocol running over the relay station 1006.<br><br>
Referring to FIGURE 11, there is shown a block diagram of still yet another<br>
embodiment of a wireless relay based network 1100 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The wireless relay based network 1100 includes a first node 1102 that transmits information<br>
in coded and modulated digital communications to a second node 1104 via multiple relay<br>
stations 1106 (four shown) each of which implements method 700. The second node 1104<br>
then combines the different digital communications. It should be appreciated that the number<br>
of relay stations 1106 shown in this wireless based relay network 1100 has been selected for<br>
simplicity of illustration and that the number of relay stations 1106 and their configuration is<br>
not a limitation on the invention. This is also true for the other embodiments of the wireless<br>
based relay networks 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000.<br>
It should be appreciated that the aforementioned embodiments of the present invention<br>
can be combined in various ways to enhance the performance of wireless based relay<br>
networks.<br>
Although several embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the<br>
accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it should be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of<br>
