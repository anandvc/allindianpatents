				<td>A GYPSUM BOARD AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a gypsum board and method of production<br>
thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to the composition of<br>
coatings for gypsum board products, and methods of producing and applying the<br>
coatings in one continuous gypsum board manufacturing process.<br>
DISCUSSION OF RELATED ARTS:<br>
[0002] In the discussion of the related art that follows, reference is made to certain<br>
structures and/or methods. However, the following references should not be<br>
construed as an admission that these structures and/or methods constitute prior art.<br>
Applicant expressly reserves the right to demonstrate that such structures and/or<br>
methods do not qualify as prior art against the present invention, if appropriate.<br>
[0003] The product density and surface type and finish of traditional gypsum<br>
board products are manufactured to have a desired strength and appearance while<br>
minimizing product weight and costs. Generally, calcined gypsum slurry is<br>
agitated in a mixer with aqueous foaming agents and deposited onto a conveyor<br>
carrying a facing sheet. A backing sheet is applied over the slurry and the wet<br>
gypsum board product is formed to the desired thickness between forming rollers.<br>
The wet gypsum sets during the conveying process, is cut to the desired length,<br>
and is dried by passing the gypsum board product through a drying oven.<br>
[0004] Coatings for gypsum board products may be used to impart surface<br>
homogeneity and improved surface appearance, both in the manufactured<br>
condition and after a decorative coating has been applied. An example of a<br>
previously known two-step manufacturing method for coated gypsum board<br>
products is disclosed in Australian Patent Application No. 19322/92, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A surface coating is<br>
applied to the facing sheet and dried before the gypsum is applied to the facing<br>
sheet in the gypsum board manufacturing process.<br>
[0005] An alternative method for applying a coating utilizes a separate coating<br>
process subsequent to the manufacture and drying of the gypsum board product.<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent No. 6,105,325, issued to Zuber et al., the disclosure of which<br>
is also incorporated herein by reference, discloses the use of matching the finished<br>
appearance of a joint-pointing coat to that of the lining of the paper of the plaster<br>
boards jointed.<br>
[0007] In the above processes, the coating imparts desirable aesthetic qualities<br>
including surface coloration, reflectance, and absorbency. However, the methods<br>
are capital intensive, requiring separate and dedicated production facilities in<br>
which to apply the coating and suffering inefficiencies by not being part of a larger<br>
in-line production facility.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] The present invention provides a coated gypsum board which can be<br>
produced in one continuous gypsum board manufacturing process. Such gypsum<br>
board can be made either with paper on both sides thereof, paper on one side<br>
thereof, or without paper on either side thereof. Further, such gypsum board<br>
coatings may be applied to wet gypsum board prior to drying.<br>
[0009] In an exemplary embodiment, a coated gypsum board comprises a gypsum<br>
core having a first side and second side and a facing sheet disposed on the first<br>
side. A coating is disposed on at least a portion of the facing sheet and at least a<br>
portion of the coating penetrates into the gypsum core. In an additional<br>
embodiment, the gypsum board further comprises a backing sheet on the second<br>
side of the gypsum core. In one aspect, the coating may penetrate into the gypsum<br>
core to a substantially uniform depth across an area of the gypsum board. A<br>
gypsum board with such a coating exhibits a naiJ hold value of greater than 80<br>
pounds.<br>
[0010] In a method of producing a coated gypsum board, a gypsum slurry is<br>
deposited to form a wet gypsum board, a coating is applied to the wet gypsum<br>
board, and the wet gypsum board is dried. The coating can be applied directly to<br>
the gypsum core or to a facing sheet applied over the gypsum slurry. When the<br>
coating is applied to the gypsum board prior to drying, the coating can penetrate<br>
into the facing sheet and/or the gypsum core and forms a coating that is up to 30<br>
mils in thickness.<br>
[0011] In one exemplary embodiment, a coating to be applied to a gypsum board<br>
is a joint compound or a diluted joint compound.<br>
[0012] In another exemplary embodiment, the coating has a composition of 25-75<br>
vol.% water, 30-70 wt. % calcium carbonate, 0-30 wt.% fillers, 2-10 wt. % latex<br>
emulsion, and 0-10 wt. % other additives. Fillers can comprise one or more of<br>
mica, talc, clay and limestone. 2-8 wt. % perlite can be added to the coating to<br>
form a lightweight product and pigment can also be added in an amount effective<br>
to provide a desired tint to the coating.<br>
[0013] In a further embodiment, a coating to be applied to a gypsum board has a<br>
composition of 10-60 vol. % water, 50-90 vol. % calcined gypsum; 0.1-10 vol. %<br>
binder; 0-50 vol. % limestone; 0-10 vol. % clay; 0-30 vol. % other fillers; and 0-10<br>
vol% additives. Fillers can comprise one or more of mica and talc. 2-15 vol. %<br>
perlite can be added to the coating to form a lightweight product and pigment can<br>
also be added in an amount effective to provide a desired tint to the coating.<br>
[0014] An exemplary method of making a wall deposits a gypsum slurry to form a<br>
wet gypsum board having a gypsum core, applies a coating to the wet gypsum<br>
board, and dries the wet gypsum board. The step of applying the coating occurs<br>
prior to the step of drying the wet gypsum board. The coated gypsum board is<br>
then fastened to a support structure to form the wall and the seams between<br>
adjacent coated gypsum boards are taped and finished using a joint compound<br>
having a composition substantially similar to the composition of the coating.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020] Although the description herein may from time to time refers to either a<br>
wallboard, a ceiling tile, a ceiling board, or collectively to a gypsum board, in<br>
each case, the concepts of the present invention may be applied generally to<br>
wallboards, ceiling boards, or ceiling tiles.<br>
[0021] Generally, gypsum beard is installed during construction on surfaces such<br>
as wall, ceilings, and the like, in edge abutting engagement. After affixing the<br>
gypsum board to the surface with suitable attachments (e.g., nails, screws, epoxy,<br>
and so forth), the seams and/or artifacts from the attachments (eg., depressions<br>
from nails, nail heads, screw holes, and so forth) are covered with a coating to<br>
present a uniform and smooth finish. For seams, said coatings can be used in<br>
combination with tape. The coating material is sometimes referred to as joint<br>
compound.<br>
[0022] Coatings for use in the gypsum board industry can be of one of two types.<br>
In a first type, the coating is applied and the evaporation of water over time<br>
produces a hard coating. In a second type, the coating is applied and allowed to<br>
set for a suitable time during which the components of the coating solidify into a<br>
hard gypsum-based coating.<br>
[0023] A coating of either of the first type or the second type can be applied to<br>
one side of a gypsum board (e.g., applied to a facing sheet or directly to a gypsum<br>
core) during the manufacturing process to form a coated gypsum board. The<br>
selection of the coating can be made such that the coating of the coated gypsum<br>
board substantially matches the coating or joint compound intended to be used to<br>
cover the seams and/or artifacts of attachment associated with the affixing of the<br>
coated gypsum board to a structural support.<br>
[0024] An embodiment of a coated gypsum board 100 is shown in Figure 1. A<br>
gypsum core 105 is disposed between a backing sheet 110 and a facing sheet 115.<br>
A coating 120 is disposed on the facing sheet 115. An alternative embodiment of<br>
a coated gypsum board 200 is shown in Figure 2, in which a coating 205 is<br>
directly disposed on a gypsum board 210. It should be clear that any combination<br>
of facing sheet and backing sheet may be utilized in practicing the invention. In<br>
cases where one or more sheets have been removed, the coating may be applied<br>
directly to the gypsum core with attendant penetration of the coating into the<br>
gypsum core.<br>
[0025] The coating is evenly applied onto the surface of the gypsum board (e.g.,<br>
applied to the facing sheet, if used, or directly to the gypsum core) to a uniform<br>
thickness t that is preferably not sensitive to surface irregularities. A typical<br>
thickness t for the coating is up to 30 mils, preferably from 3-20 mils, and more<br>
preferably from 5-15 mils. The preferred thickness can be dependent on the<br>
ultimate application. For example, for wallboards, the thickness t is preferably 10<br>
mils; for ceiling tiles it is 20 mils. Furthermore, thicknesses outside of these<br>
ranges may also be contemplated by the present invention. However, a coating of<br>
approximately 30 mils or greater may result in cracks and grazing of the surface<br>
finish when dried. Accordingly, thicker coatings should be used carefully.<br>
[0026] In embodiments in which the gypsum board has a facing sheet, the coating<br>
may penetrate into at least a portion of the facing sheet and, in some cases, all the<br>
way through the facing sheet and into sections of the gypsum core, over at least a<br>
portion of the gypsum board. In one embodiment, the coating may penetrate into<br>
the gypsum board over substantially the whole of the area to which it is applied,<br>
i.e, the whole gypsum board, or predetermined portions if selected regions of the<br>
gypsum board have been coated.<br>
[0027] The depth of penetration of the coating can be influenced by the relative<br>
moisture level and/or degree of set of the gypsum board, although the coating<br>
preferably penetrates into the gypsum board to a substantially uniform depth. In<br>
the cross-sectional view as shown in Figure 1, the coating 120 is shown to have<br>
penetrated into the facing sheet 115 and into the gypsum core 110 to a depth d. In<br>
other cases, i.e., where the moisture content is lower or the gypsum is in a state of<br>
more advanced set, the coating only penetrates a certain depth into the facing<br>
sheet. In one embodiment of a gypsum board with a facing sheet, the depth of<br>
penetration into the gypsum core is from about 5 mils to 20 mils, preferably from<br>
10 mils to 15 mils. In embodiments of a gypsum board without a facing sheet, the<br>
depth of penetration is from about 5 mils to 30 mils, preferably from 10 mils to 20<br>
mils.<br>
[0028] A method of producing a coated gypsum board is shown in Figure 3, in<br>
which a flow chart of a coated gypsum board manufacturing line is depicted. The<br>
general manufacturing steps 300 include mixing 305 the gypsum slurry and<br>
forming 310 the gypsum into a desired shape, cutting 315 the gypsum into the<br>
desired dimensions, followed by coating 320 to form a gypsum board product and<br>
then drying 325. Setting of the gypsum occurs primarily between the forming step<br>
310 and the cutting step 315. The manufacturing steps from forming 310 to<br>
cutting, inclusive, are herein described as the forming and setting line; the steps<br>
following cutting 315 are herein described as the coating and drying line.<br>
[0029] Starting at the forming and setting line, a formed, coated gypsum board is<br>
manufactured. In a first embodiment, a gypsum core is coated on a first surface<br>
with a coating while the gypsum core is wet. In alternative embodiments, the<br>
gypsum board has a facing sheet and/or a backing sheet and is coated on a first<br>
surface, e.g., on the facing sheet surface, with a coating while the gypsum core is<br>
wet. For purposes of this application, a gypsum core is considered wet at any<br>
time during the manufacturing process before the gypsum board is passed through<br>
the drying oven.<br>
[0030] To control the setting time of the gypsum core, the components of the<br>
gypsum board can be adjusted, by, for example, controlling the quantity of<br>
accelerator and the retarder used in the composition of the gypsum slurry. The<br>
accelerator includes small crystal-like objects which are coated with a starch or<br>
other dissolvable substances. As the coating on the starch or other dissolvable<br>
substances is dissolved, the accelerator crystals form a starting point or seed for<br>
crystal growth of the gypsum. Retarder is preferably added to the gypsum board<br>
components in order to delay the set time of the gypsum core. The retarder has no<br>
long term effect on the strength or other characteristics of the final board product.<br>
[0031] It is desirable to delay the set time under certain circumstances so that the<br>
gypsum slurry does not set earlier than desired. For example, if the gypsum<br>
slurry begins to set in the mixer, inefficiencies result, such as blocked and/or<br>
clogged apparatus with attendant down time for maintenance and/or repairs. In<br>
addition, if the slurry sets beyond the mixer but prior to forming, forming of the<br>
slurry may cause the crystal structure to be disrupted during the setting process,<br>
which can result in a weaker final board product. Accordingly, accelerator and<br>
retarder may be used singularly or in combination to adjust the set time of the<br>
gypsum to achieve a desired set or hardness at a desired time in the manufacturing<br>
process.<br>
[0032] After forming, the gypsum board is conveyed by a conveying system along<br>
the forming and setting line to a cutting position. The conveying speed and<br>
distance are chosen in combination with the set time of the gypsum to result in<br>
gypsum having a desired set or hardness for subsequent cutting and manipulation.<br>
Cutting is accomplished by a cutting machine, as is conventionally known in the<br>
art. After being cut, the gypsum board is turned over and placed on a conveying<br>
surface and transported to a coating and drying line. Where the gypsum core has a<br>
facing and/or backing sheet, the manipulation of the gypsum board results in<br>
placing the backing sheet in contact with conveying surface and exposing the<br>
facing sheet.<br>
[0033] On the coating and drying line, the gypsum board, with or without the<br>
facing and/or backing sheet, is conveyed by the conveying means through coating<br>
machinery, which is located prior to the drying apparatus. Figure 4 schematically<br>
depicts an in-line coating process 400. The coating machinery 405 is positioned<br>
over the conveying path 410 of the gypsum board 415. The conveying path<br>
typically includes a conveying belt 420 on which the gypsum board to be coated<br>
has been placed, although other suitable conveying paths can be used, such as<br>
driven and nondriven rollers. An uncoated and wet gypsum board 425 is passed<br>
under the coating machinery 405 and a coating is applied via a coating applicator<br>
430. The coated gypsum board 435 is then conveyed to the next manufacturing<br>
steps, if any, and is then dried in, for example, an oven.<br>
[0034] The coating can be applied using traditional coating machinery, such as a<br>
curtain coater. An example of a curtain coater is that provided by Hymmen<br>
International, which can be custom designed to adapt to a particular production<br>
line or manufacturing facility. The curtain coater provides a continuous curtain of<br>
the coating through which the wet gypsum board is passed. Alternative coating<br>
machinery may include sprayers, such as nozzle or shower sprayers, drip lines,<br>
and atomization techniques. An example of a spray technology is that provided by<br>
Graco, Inc. using spray tips suspended over the wallboard line. Another<br>
alternative method is a blade technology that scrapes the coating mix on to the<br>
surface of the gypsum board, i.e., on the surface of the gypsum core or the facing<br>
sheet.<br>
[0035] Coatings may be applied to the gypsum board under any condition of set of<br>
the gypsum. For example, the coating can be applied before oven drying, thus<br>
allowing the coating to penetrate into the wet facing sheet and/or the wet gypsum<br>
core during the conveying period. After coating, the coated gypsum board is dried<br>
and then prepared for storage and shipping. Alternatively, the coating can be<br>
applied after drying where, for example, the coating is heat sensitive or<br>
penetration into the facing sheet is to be minimized.<br>
[0036] Coatings can be applied to the whole surface area of the gypsum board , or<br>
to predetermined portions thereof. In the latter, predetermined portions can be so<br>
designated by, for example, masking the gypsum board to prevent coating of the<br>
designated sections or by adjusting the coating machinery to only apply a coating<br>
to predetermined portions.<br>
[0037] Several alternative embodiments of compositions of coating are envisioned,<br>
each affecting the end product. One embodiment of a coating, referred to herein<br>
as the "rapid coating", is a coating that hardens by evaporation of the water<br>
content. The rapid coating comprises water; calcium carbonate; fillers such as<br>
limestone, mica, talc, and/or clay; binder; latex emulsion; and other additives such<br>
as preservative, and thickener. The rapid coating is provided with a water content<br>
of 35-45 wt. % and is diluted in the mixture to between 10% and 60% dilution,<br>
e.g., to between 25-70 wt. %, preferably between 39 wt. % and 56 wt. % water, by<br>
the addition of water. Table 1 presents an exemplary formulation of an<br>
embodiment of the rapid coating.<br>
[0039] In a lightweight embodiment of the rapid coating, the filler can include<br>
from 2% to 8% by weight perlite. An additional embodiment of the rapid coating<br>
incorporates a pigment added in an amount effective to provide a desired tint to<br>
the coating. Additionally, the rapid coating may be made so as to substantially<br>
match a property of the joint compound, such as the absorbency, the reflectance,<br>
and so forth. The substantial matching of one or more properties may improve the<br>
aesthetic appearance of the gypsum board in the finished condition after a<br>
decorative coating has been applied.<br>
[0040] Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, a wall can be assembled by<br>
producing a gypsum board and coating the gypsum board before the drying step<br>
with a joint compound or a diluted joint compound. And, when the gypsum board<br>
is fastened to a supporting structure to form the wall, the seams between adjacent<br>
boards can be taped and finished using a joint compound having a substantially<br>
similar composition to the coating.<br>
[0041] Another embodiment of the present invention uses a coating referred to<br>
hereinafter as the "setting coating". The setting coating forms a hard gypsum-<br>
based coating by a setting process similar to that of the gypsum in the gypsum<br>
board. The setting coating comprises is a dry product comprising calcined<br>
gypsum; binder; fillers such as limestone, mica, talc, and/or clay; and other<br>
additives such as preservative, accelerator, and thickener. The calcined gypsum<br>
may be either alpha or beta type or a blend of these types. Prior to use the setting<br>
coating is mixed with 30-60 vol. % water to form a mixture. Table 2 presents an<br>
exemplary formulation of a setting coating.<br>
[0043] In a lightweight embodiment of the setting coating, the filler can include<br>
from 2% to 15% by volume perlite. An additional embodiment of the setting<br>
coating incorporates a pigment added in an amount effective to provide a desired<br>
tint to the coating.<br>
[0044] The setting coating is generally more resilient to impact, i.e., tougher, than<br>
the rapid coating, and may be utilized to provide an abuse resistant surface on the<br>
gypsum board, for example, for use in high traffic areas or public spaces.<br>
Additionally, the rapid coating may be made so as to substantially match a<br>
property of the joint compound, such as the absorbency, the reflectance, and so<br>
forth. The substantial matching of one or more properties may improve the<br>
aesthetic appearance of the gypsum board in the finished condition after a<br>
decorative coating has been applied.<br>
[0045] Binders suitable for use in the above rapid coating and setting coating<br>
include starches, which assist the binding properties. Examples of such binders<br>
are wheat starch which can be preset between 0.01 and 5%.<br>
[0046] A preservative suitable for use in the above rapid coating and setting<br>
coating can be present between 0.01 and 5%. This additive prevents the product<br>
from spoiling prematurely, prior to application. The coatings can spoil because<br>
there can exist inside the formulations water and/or a number of organic raw<br>
materials. The preservative is also commonly known as the biocide.<br>
[0047] Accelerators may be used to adjust the set time in the above setting<br>
coating. An example of an accelerator is potassium sulfate. The accelerator can<br>
be present in a suitable amount to achieve the desired set time. Typically, the<br>
accelerator is present from 0.01 and 15% by solids weight.<br>
[0048] Thickeners, such as generic cellulose-based thickeners, may be used to<br>
adjust the rheological properties of the coatings and can be present in suitable<br>
amounts. Typical values are between 0.01 and 35% by solids weight.<br>
[0049] The penetration of the coating provided by the application of coatings to a<br>
wet gypsum board results in improved coated gypsum board properties, such as<br>
better adhesion of the facing sheet to the gypsum core. In one example, a coating<br>
improves board strength, as measured by nail hold. Table 3 includes nail hold<br>
values for both coated gypsum board and uncoated gypsum board. From Table 3,<br>
it is shown that the coating improves nail hold by up to 25% of nail hold values<br>
for traditional uncoated gypsum board products.<br>
[0051] Additionally, a coated gypsum board displays a mechanical or strength<br>
advantage over uncoated gypsum board products that may allow for utilization of<br>
facing sheets of lower weight with attendant cost reductions. Typically, facing<br>
sheets are anywhere between 40 to 60 lbs. weight. In some applications, the<br>
facing sheet is a paper blended with mineral or synthetic fibers. If the facing sheet<br>
is to be coated, the improved board strength imparted by the coating allows the<br>
paper weight to be reduced. This advantage of the invention is realized while still<br>
obtaining the required handling characteristics to allow manipulation without<br>
breakage during the manufacturing process.<br>
[0052] According to one preferred embodiment, a gypsum board is produced by<br>
forming a gypsum slurry and depositing the slurry onto a facing sheet laid out on<br>
an endless conveyor belt. A backing sheet is then laid on top of the gypsum<br>
slurry. The facing sheet, the gypsum slurry, and the backing sheet are then<br>
formed into a wet gypsum board by passing the gypsum and optional facing and<br>
backing sheet through a forming roller or rollers to produce the desired thickness.<br>
The wet gypsum board is carried by a conveyor belt until a set time expires, after<br>
which the gypsum board is cut into desired lengths with a blade cutter, and then<br>
passed through a mechanical coater. A subsequent application of heat, such as in<br>
a dryer or an oven, removes excess water. At any stage during the process, either<br>
the facing sheet or the backing sheet or both may be removed.<br>
[0053] In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the gypsum board<br>
product can be formed in a manufacturing line as generally known for making<br>
ceiling tiles. In such a process, the desired components are blended with a high<br>
shear mixer in a batch. The batch is then extruded through an opening of an<br>
extruder onto an endless conveyor belt. After a predetermined set time, the<br>
mixture is then cut into desired lengths. The cut lengths are then passed through a<br>
mechanical coater followed by a dryer to evaporate the excess water.<br>
[0054] According to an embodiment of the present invention, lightweight gypsum<br>
boards can be made. The density of such boards can range from as low as 1,000<br>
lbs. per thousand square feet to about 1,700 lbs. per thousand square feet, or<br>
greater. After cutting the gypsum and while the gypsum is still not dry, the wet<br>
gypsum board is transported to the coating and drying line. A coating of thickness<br>
of up to 30 mils is applied which is subsequently dried in a drying process, e.g.,<br>
dried in an oven.<br>
[0055] According to another embodiment of the present invention, a gypsum board<br>
product of a desired thickness can be made as conventionally known. For<br>
example, a 1/2 inch or 1/4 inch gypsum board can be made. After cutting the<br>
gypsum and while the board is still not dry, the wet gypsum board is transported<br>
to the coating and drying line. A coating of thickness of up to 30 mils is applied<br>
which is subsequently dried in a drying process, e.g., dried in an oven.<br>
[0056] Although the present invention has been described in connection with<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that additions, deletions, modifications, and substitutions not specifically described<br>
may be made without department from the spirit and scope of the invention as<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br>
