Device, strap and garment for treating skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for repairing sports injury, and method for making same.<br>
The present invention relates to a device for treating skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for repairing sports injury, of the type comprising a first web of flexible material and a projecting structure which is joined to the web and comprises a plurality of discrete projecting elements, said projecting elements comprising pieces of foam which are spaced apart from one another and are joined to said first web.<br>
There are various known devices of that type, such as foam pads from one face of which hemispherical forms project (DE-296 18 426 U1). In other known devices, a textile surface or a flexible material carries half-spheres which have a very small radius of curvature, from 1 mm to 5 mm, and are constituted by a relatively hard material.<br>
However, such devices exhibit disappointing therapeutic results and are poorly tolerated by patients owing to allergies or a lack of comfort.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the effectiveness of the treatment of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders by means of a device, which is well tolerated by patients.<br>
To that end, the invention relates to a device of the above-mentioned type, characterized in that the pieces of foam are compressed between said first web and a second web of flexible material, the two webs adhering together between the projecting elements.<br>
Other features of the device are described in claims 2 to 15.<br><br>
The invention relates also to a piece of foam for a treatment device as defined above, characterized in that it comprises a first end layer with high indentation and a second end layer with low indentation.<br>
According to an embodiment, the piece of foam is composed of two superposed elements which are constituted by different foams and are joined to one another, namely a first element of foam with low indentation and a second element of foam with high indentation.<br>
The invention relates also to:<br>
-	a strap for treating skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for repairing sports injury, comprising a device as defined above bordered by two edges which do not have projecting elements;<br>
-	a garment for treating skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and for repairing sports injury, comprising a device as defined above on at least a portion of its inside surface; and<br>
-	a method for producing a device as defined above, characterized in that said first web is advanced on a substantially horizontal plane, the pieces of foam are dropped at regular intervals onto said first web as it advances and are fixed thereto, and said second web of flexible material is applied to the pieces of foam so that it compresses the pieces of foam and adheres to said first web between the pieces.<br>
In a mode of implementation, strips of foam are moved forward in parallel chutes which open into a supply zone, and the strips of foam are cut at regular intervals to form the pieces of foam, which fall onto said first web as it advances.<br>
The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description, which is given solely by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

-	Figure 14 is a cross-sectional view of the device in a particular embodiment in which the pieces are composed of two different foams.<br>
The device 1 shown in Figures 1 and 2 is to be placed on the skin beneath a compression or retaining bandage in order to treat skin or subcutaneous tissue disorders and, in particular, to treat various types of edema or excessive tissue infiltration. In that case, the device is said to be reducing. The device can also be used for repairing sports injury after strain. The device 1 substantially comprises blocks of foam 3 which are spaced apart from one another and are compressed<br><br>
between two webs of flexible material 5 and 7. The two webs adhere to one another between the blocks of foam.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the blocks are obtained from a sheet of cast latex foam, which is able to expand freely so as to form a lightweight foam having open cells. The foam is very resilient so that it is able to adapt to the shape of any body surface against which it is pressed. The indentation of the foam can vary according to the pathologies and the area of the body to which the device 1 is applied, as is shown by the table below. In general, the indentation is from 200 to 250 N, but it can also be higher on healthy skin, for use in the repair of sports injury. The density of the foam can vary in a range of from 13 to 100 kg/m’.<br>
As is well known, indentation is a method of measuring the hardness by indentation of flexible alveolar materials. The indentation value is the force applied for a penetration of 40% of an indenter, under standardized conditions described in standard IS02439 of September 1997.<br>
Foam indentation values as a function of the type of pathology<br><br>
Low indentation	Edemas of soft texture on fragile skin or particularly painful edemas:-	post-surgical edemas (orthopedic surgery, etc.)-	edemas following liposuction-	traumatic edemas (sprain)-	cardiac or renal edemas which affect the lower limbs-	inflammatory edemas (aigodystrophy, gonarthrosis, etc.)-	allergic edemas-	edemas of burns in the acute phase<br>
Medium indentation	-	edemas of stases-	edemas   of   venous,   acute   or   chronic   insufficiency   (phlebitis,hypodermitis,)-	fatty edemas, cellulite, excess weight, edemas of peripheralneurological origin (laxities due to irradiation)<br><br>
	-	edemas of central origin: hemiplegia, paraplegia, etc.-	incipient lymphedemas<br>
High indentation	-	constituted lymphedemas-	elephantiasis-	all healthy fibrous tissues-	all chiliad scars (if they are not inflammatory)-	ulcers which are neither infected nor inflammatory-	ochre dermatitis<br>
Foam indentation values as a function of the area of the body<br><br>
Low indentation	All visible osseous reliefs (Achilles tendon, tibia crest, clavicle, etc.) and all areas where the lymphatic ganglions are palpable-	knee-	neck of the foot-	crease of the groin-	antero-internal face of the thigh-	antero-internal face of the arm-	elbow-	axillary hollow, etc.<br>
High indentation	-	top of the foot-	back of the lateral and medial alveolus-	outside surface of the thigh, hip, buttocks, back in general, pubis andvirtually the whole of the leg (except the tibia crest)-	back of the hand-	forearm-	ext and post face of the arm-	the toes<br>
The size and shape of the blocks vary according to the pathology and the area of the body against which the device is pressed. In the embodiment shown, the pieces of foam are in the form of regular blocks of height h and substantially square cross-section, of side d. Their height h preferably varies from 8 to 12 mm and the cross-sectional area varies from 25 mm  for the fingers and toes to<br><br>
900 mm’ for the back or the abdomen, passing through 100   for the hand and 400 mm’ for the arm or thigh. In another embodiment, the blocks are parallelepipeds in the form of elongated tongues, one of the dimensions of which is very much greater than the others.<br>
The flexible material used for the webs 5 and 7 can be, for example, an adhesivated polyester nonwoven which has a density of 50 g/m’ and has intrinsic elasticity in one direction. By way of variation, it can be a polyurethane nonwoven in two directions orthogonal with respect to one another, or a multidirectional elastic woven material<br>
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the blocks of foam relative to one another in the plane of one of the two webs. The blocks of foam are aligned substantially according to regular rows parallel to a direction X, but their orientation is irregular relative to the axis of symmetry of each cube perpendicular to the plane of the web.<br>
Each block 3 is at a distance of from d/2 to d from a first group of four immediately adjacent blocks 11 and at a distance of the order of 2d from a second group of four immediately adjacent blocks 13. The pieces 3 and 11 are aligned substantially according to the direction X and according to a direction X' substantially orthogonal to X, and the pieces 3 and 13 are aligned in two directions Y and Y' which are substantially orthogonal to each other and are inclined by approximately 45° relative to the directions X and X'.<br>
That arrangement can be obtained by the production method described in Figure 11. The first web 5 of adhesivated flexible material, which is covered with a temporary protective film 14 and wound on a supply spool 15, is spread out on a flat horizontal support 16 and advances horizontally, pulled by a receiving spool 17. Upstream of the support 16, the sheet 14 is wound on another spool 18. A block supply zone 19 is defined at the upstream end of the support 16. The<br><br>
supply zone contains several strips of foam which are aligned in parallel chutes and are cut into blocks by a guillotine 23.<br>
The blocks fall at an adjustable frequency, and their height of fall is also adjustable. The frequency of fall determines the spacing of the cubes on the support web 5 as it advances. The height of fall determines the orientation of the blocks, which will be less regular as the height increases.<br>
As the blocks fall, they become fixed to the adhesive web 5. The second web of flexible material 7, which is unwound from a spool 24, is likewise adhesivated and protected temporarily by a film 25, which is collected on a spool 26. The web 7 is then applied to the blocks of foam by a calendaring roller 27. As it compresses the blocks of foam 3, it adheres to the first support web 5 between them.<br>
In another embodiment (Figure 12), the supply zone contains blocks of foam which are pre-cut in the chutes 21 and are distributed by a distributor/metering device 29, for example having two doors 30, 31 which move alternately.<br>
The methods described above are suitable for permitting the production of the device 1 in the form of a sheet, for example having a length of 5 meters and a width of 30 cm, or alternatively in the form of a strap of the same length and having a width of 10 cm.<br>
In both cases, cut piece of sheet or strap, the device 1 can be held against the skin by means of a retaining strip, for example of FLEXIDEAL®, which holds the device against the skin, or alternatively by a compression bandage, for example of BIFLEX®, which, in addition to holding the device, exerts a pressure to a greater or lesser degree, which compresses the device against the skin. The type of strip used, rigid or elastic, for the reducing bandage depends on the pressure required for the pathology that is being treated.<br><br>
The sheet is intended to be cut by a practitioner, who will adapt it to the area of tissue to be treated.<br>
Figure 3 shows the use of the device in sheet form on an arm, without appreciable compression. The device 1 is held by a dressing in the form of a circular net 33. This assembly acts very rapidly on edemas of vascular origin, which are most of the time very soft, as well as on lymphedemas, especially fluid lymphedemas.<br>
Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional view of the use of the same device on an arm, with compression. In that case, the device 1 is held by a compression bandage 34, which maintains a substantial pressure on the cubes of foam, which are much more compressed. That use of the device is carried out in the case of very fibrous lymphedemas.<br>
The strap (Figure 5) is to be used to make a bandage around a limb. In the case of the strap, the production process will provide along the strap two edges 35 and 36 which do not have blocks of foam. The edges are used when bandaging a limb, as is shown in Figures 6 and 7. The advantage of the strap is that it can be adapted to the reduction in volume that it causes and that, owing to its simplicity, it can be used by the patient himself. The edge serves as a guide for the juxtaposition of the different bandage turns. Figure 6 shows, in cross-sectional view, two bandage turns 37 and 38. The edge portion 35 of the bandage turn 37 serves as a guide for the bandage turn 38, the edge portion 36 of which comes to rest on the adjacent blocks of the turn 37. Figure 7 shows in a top view, in diagrammatic form, that the bandage so produced on the arm is substantially homogeneous with regard to the distribution of the blocks of foam.<br>
The device 1 can also be used in the form of a retaining garment. The advantage of the retaining garment is that it renders treatment much more bearable for the<br><br>
patient. The patient will accordingly be more disposed to follow his treatment, which will therefore be more effective.<br>
An embodiment of a garment associated with the device 1 is shown in Figures 10A to 10C: the device 1, in the form of a cut piece 41 of sheet or strap, is inserted into a garment 42 which has been cut along a generating line 43. The piece 41 is sown inside the garment at the location where the treatment is to be applied. The garment is finally sown up along the generating line 43.<br>
The garment can be especially a sports sock, stocking or tights, or briefs for various uses. The briefs can likewise be used for anti-cellulite treatment.<br>
As a precaution, the inside of the garment should not be covered with the device in areas of articulation such as the knee and the political hollow 44 in the case of a stocking that comes up over the knee (Figure 9).<br>
That type of garment can be made-to-measure, advantageously being designed by CAD (computer-assisted design) and then cut and sown, or can be produced by means of a digitally-controlled circular knitting machine operated by a software program capable of adjusting the compression by its adaptability to the patient's measurements, which are stored in a memory.<br>
The reducing bandage is all the more effective if the pressure of the device against the skin is great, if it is worn for a long time and if muscular activity is associated therewith.<br>
The pressure can be increased by a compression fitting and/or by muscular activity of the limb on which the bandage is applied.<br>
The time for which the patient wears the bandage can be increased, because the device is well tolerated and simple to use. The patient's tolerance of the device,<br><br>
associated with a low-compression bandage or a made-to-measure garment, allows the patient to wear the device during his sleep, for example.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 show the marks of the blocks on the skin after the reducing bandage has been removed from an arm (Figure 9) and a leg (Figure 10). The edges of the blocks of foam pressed against the skin act by a shearing effect on the skin, massage it, allowing the surface microcirculation in the region of the superficial cutaneous network to be increased and, in the case of lymphatic edemas, allowing softening of the subjacent skin elements to begin. The shearing effect consists in moving the tissues relative to one another, in promoting sliding planes in order to reach the deeper layers of the cutaneous network. Owing to the different distances between immediately adjacent pieces of foam and the elasticity of the webs 5 and 7, different pressures exerted on the subjacent tissue have the effect of reducing the stiffness and immobility thereof.<br>
The shearing effect thus renders the pressure much more effective, which results in the drainage of the fluids towards the superficial collectors then the deeper collectors of the lymphatic network. The pressure effect is made effective by the small distance separating each piece of foam from the first group of adjacent pieces, while the shearing effect, linked with the freedom of movement of the blocks, is promoted by the large distance separating each block from the second group of adjacent blocks, and by the elasticity of the webs 5 and 7.<br>
Accordingly, the device according to the invention has a double effect, of shearing and of draining self-massage, which is particularly beneficial for circulation in the cutaneous and subcutaneous region.<br>
That essential double action is all the more effective because the treatment is well tolerated by patients owing to the production processes between two webs. The device can also be used at night,  in the form of a garment or low-<br><br>
compression bandage, which promotes good patient compliance with the treatment.<br>
In another embodiment, shown in Figure 14, each piece of foam is composed of two superposed elements constituted by different foams, the first element 8 made of a foam with high indentation on the side of one of the webs of flexible material 5 and the second element 9 of a foam with low indentation, bonded to the element 8 on the side of the other web of flexible material 7. The elements 8 and 9 can be bonded to one another. By way of variation, by means of an appropriate foaming process, it is possible to obtain blocks in which the indentation varies continuously from one face to the other.<br>
The advantage of that embodiment is that the distribution of the retaining/compression force is improved, the compression force being applied on the face with low indentation, without making the blocks more aggressive towards the patients skin.<br>
Figure 13 shows another embodiment in which the blocks are staggered from one row according to direction X to the next row, each block being joined to four of its closest neighbours by a foam joining element 44, That arrangement of the blocks can be obtained by punching a sheet of foam out.<br>
In that case, each block 3 has six close neighbours 11, aligned according to three directions X, X' and X", and two substantially more distant neighbours 13, which are aligned according to a direction Y which lies between the directions X and X".<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
