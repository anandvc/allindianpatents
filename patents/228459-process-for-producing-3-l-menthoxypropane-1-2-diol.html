The present invention relates to a process for producing 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol useful as a cooling agent and a refrigerant, and to a 3-^-menthoxypropane derivative useful as an intermediate for producing 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol and a process for producing the same.  According to the invention, highly pure 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol and 3-1-menthoxypropane derivatives useful as synthetic intermediates for 3-1-menthoxypropane-l , 2-diol can be obtained safely and in high yields through simple operations.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
3-1-Menthoxypropane-l,2-diol is a known compound as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 48813/1986. 3-1-Menthoxypropane-l,2-diol is excellent in safety and also have a nature of imparting a cooling effect on skin and mucous membrane like 1-menthol.  On the other hand, it is odorless unlike 1-menthol, and itself has no smell. Therefore, in the case of using 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol, a cooling effect can be imparted to a product without affecting the fragrance imparted to the product. Thus, utilizing the above characteristic of 3-1-menthoxypropane-l ,2-diol, 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol has been blended with oral compositions such as tooth<br><br>
paste and chewing gtun, and food and drink such as sherbet and hard candies, and further, it has been proposed to blend it with toilet articles such as cosmetics<br>
(Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 25908/1985 and 208505/1988) , an eye-pack agent (P\iblished Japanese Patent Application No. 96403/1987) and a haia? cosmetic<br>
(Published Japanese Patent Application No. 192312/1987), and others such as an aerosol composition for anti¬inflammatory agents (Published Japanese Patent Application No. 264522/1988).<br>
Processes for producing 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol which are known heretofore include (i) a process wherein 1-menthol is converted to the sodium salt with metal sodium or sodium hydride, then an allyl halide is reacted therewith to produce 3-1-menthoxypropan-l-ene, and it is oxidized using an organic peroxide to form an oxide, followed by hydrolysis (Japanese Patent Publication No. 48813/1986), and (ii) a process wherein 1-menthol is added to benzyl glycidyl ether in the presence of a Lewis acid to produce l-benzyloxy-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol and it is subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of palladi;im-Garbon catalyst to eliminate the benzyl group<br>
(P-ublished Japanese Patent Application No. 82200/1995) .<br>
However, in the above conventional method (i), sodium salt of 1-menthol is produced with metal sodium or sodium hydride, and therefore there are problems of the<br><br>
risk of explosion and the generation of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, an intermediate of 3-1-menthoxypropan-l-ene is oxidized with an organic peroxide, and thus the risk of explosion also exists at the use.  Accordingly, the process is not regarded as an industrially advantageous one and also some improvement is required from an economical point of view.<br>
Moreover, since the above conventional process (ii) is a process for the purpose of synthesizing an optical isomer, it is necessary to use expensive benzyl glycidyl ether.  In addition, 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol finally obtained contains about 10% of 2-1-menthoxypropane-l,3-diol as a by-product, so that the purification or fractionation by silica gel coltimn chromatography or the like is necessary and thus it is difficult to obtain a large amount of highly pure 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol.<br>
Furthermore, other than the above conventional processes, proposed is (iii) a process wherein 1-menthol is added to a 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane such as epichlorohydrin in an aqueous solution in the presence of a base and a quaternary ammonium salt to produce 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane which is a synthetic intermediate for 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol [French Patent No. 2479822 (1981)].  However, l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane such as epichlorohydrin is known to be unstable and prone to decompose in the presence of an<br><br>
acid or a base ["Kagaku Daijiten", p. 292, published by Tokyo Kagaku Dojin (1989)].  Therefore, in the case of this process where a 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane is reacted in the presence of a base, the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane decomposes when the reaction takes a long period of time, so that it is difficult to syjithesize 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane, and thus this process is not regarded as an advantageous process from industrial and economical viewpoints.<br>
Furthermore, as the reaction between epichlorohydrin and an alcohol, proposed is (iv) a process for producing l-allyloxy-3-chloro-2-propanol by reacting epichlorohydrin with allyl alcohol in the presence of an acidic catalyst (Published Japanese Patent Application No. 221/1990).  In this conventional process (iv), however, the alcohol to be used in the reaction is only primary allyl alcohol and the application to a secondary alcohol, much less the addition reaction with menthol, is not reported.<br>
In addition, as another conventional process, there is proposed (v) a process wherein an epihalohydrin is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, then the product is treated with an alkali to form a glycidyl ether through ring closure, and after hydrolysis, the reaction mixture is heated at 100 to 230°C in the presence of a salt formed from a strongly basic<br><br>
compound and a weakly acidic compound to produce a glycerol ether (Published Japanese Patent Application No. 212114/2000).  However, in order to decompose an organohalogen contained in hydrolyzate of the glycidyl ether, this process requires heating the reaction mixture at a high temperature of 100 to 230°C, especi,ally 150 to 200°C in the presence of a salt formed from a strongly basic compound and a weakly acidic compound, and thus is not an efficient process.  Furthermore, the alcohol to be used in the process is a primary alcohol represented by the general formula: R-(OA) p-OH (wherein R represents a saturated or unsaturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 1 to 36 carbon atoms, A represents an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and p represents one niamber of 0 to 100) , and the use of secondary alcohol is not disclosed, much less the use of menthol is not disclosed at all.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a process for producing highly pure 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol safely and in high yields through simple operations.<br>
Other object of the invention is to provide an intermediate useful for obtaining highly pure 3-1-menthoxypropane-l ,2-diol.<br>
Still other object of the invention is to provide a process for producing intermediates useful for obtaining 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol efficiently.<br><br>

(wherein X represents a halogen atom)<br>
Namely, l-menthol is added to a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) in an organic solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid to produce a novel l-halogeno-3-1-menthoxypropan-2-ol (II).  Then, the l-halogeno-3-1-menthoxypropan-2-ol (II) is epoxidated with a base in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst to produce 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane (III), and 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol (IV) is obtained by hydrolyzing it.<br>
As a halogen atom X in the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I), fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, iodine atom, and the like may be mentioned. Thus, specific examples of the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane include 1,2-epoxy-3-fluoropropane (epifluorohydrin), 1,2-epoxy-3-chloropropane (epichlorohydrin), 1,2-epoxy-3-bromopropane<br><br>

The addition of 1-menthol to a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) is necessarily carried out in an organic solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid.  When a br(j)nsted acid (protonic acid) , a Grignard reagent or a base is used instead of a Lewis acid, an adduct (1-halogeno-3-l-menthoxYpropane or 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane) is not formed or is formed only in low yields.<br>
At the addition of 1-menthol to a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I), preferably adopted is the method wherein a Lewis acid is added to a solution of 1-menthol dissolved in an organic solvent, and then, a solution of 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) dissolved in an organic solvent is added dropwise thereto to carry out the reaction.<br><br>

The 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane (III) obtained by the above epoxidation reaction is oily and storable. Therefore, the 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane (III) obtained by the above epoxidation reaction may be stored after purification by, for example, distillation or column chromatography or without any purification, and at the production of 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (IV), the former compound may be taken out of a storing vessel and used.

The temperature for the above hydrolysis is preferably about 20 to 100°C, more preferably about 50 to 80°C.  3-1-Menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (IV) can be produced by the reaction for about 0.5 to 5 hours, preferably about 1 to 3 hours with maintaining the above temperature.  Isolation of 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (IV) from the reaction product containing 3-1-menthoxypropane-l , 2-diol (IV) can be carried out according to a conventional method.  Although the method of recovery is not particularly limited, 3-1-menthoxypropane-l , 2-diol (IV) can be isolated as a concentrate, for example, in the case that a water-soluble organic solvent is used in the reaction, by adding water to the reaction mixture according to need, removing the water-soluble organic solvent used in the reaction by evaporation, adding thereto an alkaline aqpieous solution and a hydrocarbon organic solvent such as hexane, butane, benzene, toluene or xylene to neutralize the acidic catalyst used and to extract 3-1-<br><br>
menthoxypropane-1,2-diol (IV) with an organic solvent, and finally removing the solvent by evaporation. Purification of 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (IV) can be effected by distillation or column chromatography.<br>
3-1-Menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (IV) obtained as above is used for a variety of applications such as cosmetics, toiletry goods, bath agents, food and drink, medicines, and the like with making good use of the characteristics such as cooling effect, refreshing effect, odorless property and safety.  Examples thereof include various lotions such as body lotion, after-shave lotion and hair-growth lotion; skin cosmetics such as washing cream, vanishing cream, cleansing cream, cold cream, emulsion, toilet water, facial mask, makeup remover and lip cream; cataplasm, plaster, nasal decongestant, antiperspirant; hair-care goods such as shampoo, rinse, treatment and conditioner; hair cosmetics such as hair tonic, hair cream and hair spray; perfumes, colognes; bath agent, body shampoo, soap; shaving foam and gel; detergents, softeners; in-door aromatic agent; tooth paste; mouth wash; ointment; food and drink such as refreshing drink, gram, candy, ice cream, sherbet, jelly, tablet, troche; and the like.<br>

Thereafter, 60% sodium hydride (2.82 g, 70.5 mmol) was added thereto and then the temperature was raised to 100°C.  Into the solution was added dropwise epichlorohydrin (5.93 g, 64.1 mmol) over a period of 1 hour.

As apparent from the results of Examples 1 to 5 shown in above Table 1, l-chloro-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol was obtainable in high yields of 65% or more by carrying out the reaction with Lewis acids [aluminaam chloride (AICI3) , zinc bromide (ZnBr2) , ferric chloride (FeCla) , zinc chloride (ZnCl2) , boron trifluoride ether complex<br>

EXAMPLE 7 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6 Synthesis of 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane<br>
(1)	As Example 7, 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane was synthesized in a similar manner to Example 6 with using benzyltrimethylammoniiim chloride as the phase transfer catalyst and changing the reaction time.  The conversion of l-chloro-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol at each reaction time and the selectivity to 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane were as shown in following Table 2.<br>
(2)	As Comparative Example 6, 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane was synthesized in a similar manner to Example 6 with the exception that a phase transfer catalyst (benzyltrimethylammonium chloride) was not added, with changing the reaction time.  The conversion of l-chloro-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol at each reaction time and the selectivity to 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane were as shown in following Table 2.<br><br>

9	-	-	99.4	96.9<br>
As is apparent from the results shown in Table 2, in Example 7 wherein the reaction was carried out with using a phase transfer catalyst, at the reaction time of 4 hours, the conversion of l-chloro-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol reached 100% and the selectivity to 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane is 98.2% which is an extremely high value.<br>
On the other hand, in Comparative Example 6 wherein the reaction was carried out with adding no phase transfer catalyst, increase of the conversion remarkably diminished after 2 hours of the reaction, and thus, at the reaction time of 9 hours, the conversion of 1-chloro-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol reached barely 99.4%.  At that time, however, the selectivity to 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthoxypropane decreased to 96.9%.<br><br>
From tnese results, it is evident that the process of the invention wherein epoxidation of l-halogeno-3-1-menthoxypropan-2-ol to 1,2-epoxy-3-l-menthbxypropane is carried out with using a phase transfer catalyst is extremely effective.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Synthesis of 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol<br>

temperature.  Then, anhydrous aluminum chloride (20.5 g,<br>
0.154 mol) was added thereto and dissolved under<br>
stirring, and the temperature was raised to 116°C.  Into<br>
the solution was added dropwise a solution of<br>
epichlorohydrin (178 g, 1.923 mol) dissolved in toluene<br>

they were reacted at the same temperature for 1 hour.<br>
Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled to 50°C.<br>

a 50% aqueous benzyltrimethylammonium chloride solution<br>
(14.4 g), and they were reacted at 75°C for 2 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the mixture was washed with water (513 g) and then the solvent was removed by<br><br>
evaporation to obtain an oily substance.  The substance was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 1,2-epoxy-3-1-menthoxypropane (250 g) [boiling point:' 125-140°C/1200 Pa (9 mmHg)] as a colorless transparent oily substance<br>
(yield: 61.3% based on epichlorohydrin).<br>
(3) Under a nitrogen atmosphere, into a reaction flask<br>

(2), acetone (500 ml), and 3% aqueous sulfuric acid (235 g), and the whole was dissolved under stirring, followed by heating under reflux for 2 hours.  Next, water (1000 ml) was added thereto and then, acetone was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure.  Thereafter, a 3% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (800 ml) and toluene<br>
(850 ml) was added thereto and after separation of the organic layer, the solvent was removed by evaporation to obtain an oily substance.  The stibstance was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol (250 g, chemical purity: 98.7%) [boiling point: 120-140°C/40 Pa (0.3 mmHg)] as a colorless transparent oily substance.<br>
According to the process of the invention, 3-1-menthoxypropane-l , 2 -diol useful as a cooling agent or a refrigerant can be produced safely and in high yields with a high purity through simple operations without using metal sodiiam, sodium hydride, a peroxide, or the<br><br>
like which is unstable and has an danger of explosion, and thus the process is industrially advantageous.<br>
Moreover, according to the invention,' a 1-halogeno-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-diol which is a novel intermediate for producing 3-1-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol can be produced through simple operations, safely and in high yields with a high purity by adding 1-menthol to a 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane in an organic solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid without using metal sodium, sodiiim hydride, a peroxide, or the like.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, 1,2-epoxy-3-1-menthoxypropane which is an intermediate for 3-1-menthoxypropane-l , 2-diol can be produced safely and in high yields with a high purity through a simple operation of epoxidating the novel intermediate of a l-halogeno-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-diol with a base in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
