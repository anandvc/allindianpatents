LUBRICATING OILS, LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITIONS, AND FUEL<br>
OIL COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FTELD<br>
The present invention relates to lubricating oils and lubricating oil compositions.  More particularly, the invention relates to lubricating oils comprising an α-<br>
olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer, lubricating oil compositions comprising the copolymer, and lubricating oil compositions comprising a base oil composed of a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil and an α-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer.<br>
The present invention also relates to lubricating oil viscosity index improvers and lubricating oil compatibility improvers each comprising an α-olefin/aromatic vinyl<br>
compound random copolymer.<br>
The present invention further relates to fuel oil compositions having lubricating properties, which comprise a middle fraction fuel oil and an α-olefin/aromatic vinyl<br>
compound random copolymer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Lubricating base oils, which comprise a mineral oil contained in petroleum or a synthetic oil such as an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, have been hitherto known.<br>
Further, lubricating oil compositions containing a<br><br>
viscosity index improver or a lubricating oil additive each comprising an α-olefin polymer are also known.<br>
The lubricating base oils are desired to be excellent not only in viscosity properties (particularly low-temperature fluidity) but also in heat stability, oxidation stability and lubricating properties.<br>
The lubricating base oils are blended with additives such as an extreme pressure agent, but the lubricating base oils, particularly hydrocarbon synthetic oils, usually have poor compatibility with the lubricating oil additives, and therefore the kind and the amount of the viscosity index improver or the lubricating oil additives added to the lubricating oils have been markedly limited.<br>
Lubricating oil compositions wherein esters are added as compatibility improvers to improve the compatibility of the lubricating base oils with the lubricating oil additives are known.<br>
Even the lubricating oil compositions containing the viscosity index improver or the compatibility improver are desired to be further improved in the heat stability, oxidation stability, lubricating properties and compatibility with the lubricating oil additives.  Further, lubricating base oils, which show sufficient compatibility with the lubricating oil additives even if no compatibility improver is used, are desired.<br>
By the way, when middle fraction fuel oils such as gas oil (light oil) and heavy oil are used or stored at low temperatures, crystals of waxes contained in the oils grow.<br><br>
If oils containing grown wax crystals are used, problems such as plugging (clogging) of pipes and extreme increase of viscosity of the whole oil to cause difficulty of oil flow are brought about.  To cope with the problems, addition of a fluidity improver such as an ethylene/α-<br>
olefin copolymer to the middle fraction fuel oils is known.<br>
It is also known to add polybutadiene having hydroxyl end group and containing not less than 70 % of 1,2-bonds or its hydrogenated product to the middle fraction fuel oils to lower a cold filter plugging point (CFPP).<br>
For purifying automobile exhaust gas, a low-sulfur gas oil, that is a diesel gas oil having a decreased sulfur content, tends to be used, and legal regulation is becoming severe.  However, sulfur in the fuel oil contributes to lubricating properties of the fuel oil, and if the sulfur content in the fuel oil is decreased, the lubricating properties of the fuel oil are sometimes lowered to thereby cause abrasion of fuel injection nozzles.  Accordingly, fuel oil fluidity improvers having excellent lubricating properties are desired.<br>
The present invention has been made under such circumstances as mentioned above, and it is an object of the invention to provide a lubricating oil and a lubricating oil composition each of which is excellent not only in compatibility with lubricating oil additives but also in viscosity properties, heat stability, oxidation stability and lubricating properties.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a lubricating oil composition having excellent properties, which comprises a base oil composed of a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil and a viscosity index improver comprising a specific a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a lubricating oil composition having excellent properties, which comprises a base oil composed of a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil, a compatibility improver comprising a specific low-molecular weight a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer and a lubricating oil<br>
additive.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to provide a viscosity index improver comprising a specific α-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a lubricating oil composition comprising an a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer which comprises:<br>
40 to 75% by mol of constituent units derived from ethylene,<br>
0	to 45% by mol of constituent units derived from an α-olefm of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and<br>
1	to 40% by mol of constituent units derived from an aromatic vinyl compound,<br>
with the proviso that the total amount of the constituent units derived from ethylene and the constituent units derived from the α-olefin is 60 to 99% by mol,<br>
said a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer having an intrinsic viscosity (n). as measured in decalin at 135°C, of 0.01 to 0.50 dl/g.<br>
and, a lubricating oil additive.<br>
The composition of the present invention is neither a product of a chemical reaction nor a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of the properties of the components thereof and is in fact a synergistic mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>

The process for preparing the a-olefin/aromatic vinyl<br>
compound random copolymer will be described later.<br>
The lubricating oil of the invention comprising the a-<br>
olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer is excellent in compatibility with additives as well as in viscosity properties, heat stability, oxidation stability and abrasion resistance.<br><br>
Next, the first lubricating oil composition according to the invention is described.<br>
The first lubricating oil composition of the invention comprises a lubricating base oil, which comprises the same α-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer as used<br>
for forming the above-mentioned lubricating oil, and a lubricating oil additive.<br>
Lubricating oil additive<br>
The lubricating oil additive for use in the invention is at least one additive selected from an extreme pressure agent, an abrasion resistance agent, an oiliness improver and a detergent-dispersant.<br>
Examples of the extreme pressure agents include sulfur type extreme pressure agents, such as sulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, thiophosphinates, thiocarbonates, fats and oils, sulfurized fats and oils, and olefin sulfides; phosphoric acids, such as phosphoric esters, phosphorous esters, phosphoric ester amines and phosphorous ester amines; and halogen compounds, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
Examples of the abrasion resistance agent include inorganic or organic molybdenum compounds, such as molybdenum disulfide; organoboron compounds, such as alkylmercaptyl borate; graphite; antimony sulfide; boron compounds; and polytetrafluoroetnylene.<br>
Examples of the oiliness improvers include higher fatty acids, such as oleic acid and stearic acid; higher alcohols, such as oleyl alcohol; amines; esters; sulfurized fats and oils; and chlorinated fats and oils.<br><br>
Examples of the detergent-dispersants include metallic sulfonates, such as calcium sulfonate, magnesium sulfonate and barium sulfonate; thiophosphonates,- phanates; salicylates; succinimides; benzylamine; and succinates.<br>
The first lubricating oil composition of the invention may further contain a viscosity index improver, an antioxidant, an anti-corrosion agent and an anti-foaming agent.<br>
AS the viscosity index improvers, those generally-added to lubricating oils are available, and examples thereof include natural resins, such as mineral oil, and synthetic resins, such as ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, a-<br>
olefin homopolymer, styrene/butadiene copolymer, poly(meth)acrylate and naphthalene condensate.<br>
Examples of the antioxidants include amine compounds, such as 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol; and sulfur or phosphorus compounds, such as zinc dithiophosphate.<br>
Examples of the anti-corrosion agents include carboxylic acids and their salts, such as oxalic acid; sulfonates; esters; alcohols; phosphoric acid and its •alts; beozotriazole and its derivatives; and thiazole compounds.<br>
Examples of the anti-foaming agents include silicone compounds, such as dimethylsiloxane and silica gel dispersion; alcohol compounds; and ester compounds.<br>
Though the amount of the lubricating oil additive used varies depending on the lubricating properties requested, it is in the range of usually 0.01 to 80 parts by weight,<br><br>
preferably 0.05 to 60 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random<br>
copolymer.<br>
The lubricating oil composition of the invention may further contain a mineral oil or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil in an amount of up to 50 % by weight.<br>
Since the first lubricating oil composition of the invention contains the a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound<br>
random copolymer as a base oil, the composition is excellent in compatibility with additives as well as in viscosity properties, heat stability, oxidation stability and abrasion resistance.<br>
Next, the second lubricating oil composition and the viscosity index improver according to the invention are described.<br>
The second lubricating oil composition of the invention comprises a base oil, which comprises a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil, and a specific a-<br>
olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer functioning as ft viscosity index improver.<br>
The viscosity index improver of the invention comprises the same a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random<br>
copolymer as used in the second lubricating oil composition of the invention.<br>
Base oil The base oil used in the second lubricating oil composition of the invention is a lubricating base oil comprising a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic<br><br>
oil. These oils can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds without specific limitation, as far as they have a viscosity at 100 °C of 1.5 to 40.0 mm2/S, preferably 2.0 to 10.0 mm2/S.<br>
The mineral oil has a viscosity in the above range.<br>
The mineral oil is, for example, a refined oil obtained by subjecting a paraffin base crude oil or an intermediate base crude oil to atmospheric distillation or subjecting a residual oil of the atmospheric distillation to vacuum distillation and then refining the resulting distillate oil in a conventional manner, or a deep-dewaxed oil obtained by deep-dewaxing the refined oil obtained above.  Examples of the refining methods include hydrogenation, dewaxing, solvent extraction, alkali distillation, sulfuric acid washing and clay treatment. These methods can be carried out singly or in appropriate combination, or the same method can be repeated plural times.  In these cases, there is no specific limitation on the order of the methods and the number of repetition times. In the present invention, it is particularly preferable to use a mineral oil obtained by a solvent dewaxing process that is made under severe conditions or obtained by a deep-dewaxing process such as a catalytic hydrogenation dewaxing process using a zeolite catalyst.<br>
Examples of the hydrocarbon synthetic oils preferably used include oligomers obtained by polymerizing or copolymerizing olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms or arbitrary mixtures of these olefins, such as an oligomer of 1-octene,<br><br>
an oligomer of 1-decene and an oligomer of 1-dodecene.  In addition to the mineral oil and/or the hydrocarbon synthetic oil, also available are diesters, such as di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate, dioctyl adipate and dioctyl dodecanoate, and polyol esters, such as pentaerythritol tetraoleate and trimethylolpropane tripelargonate.<br>
The oligomers are obtained by (co)polymerizing olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms by conventional processes.<br>
In the second lubxicating oil composition of tne invention, the base oil is used in an amount of 50.0 to 99.8 % by weight, preferably 60.0 to 95.0 % by weight.<br>
α-Olafin/aromatic vinvl compound random copolymer<br>
In the second lubricating oil composition of the invention, a specific a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound<br>
random copolymer functioning as a viscosity index improver is used as the base oil or the viscosity index improver. This copolymer is similar to the a-olefin/aromatic vinyl<br>
compound random copolymer for forming the lubricating oil or the first lubricating oil composition of the invention mentioned above, and is a random copolymer of ethylene and an aronatic vinyl compound (ethylene/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer) or a random copolymer of ethylene, an α-olefin of 3 to 20 carbon atoms and an aroiaacic vinyl compound (ethylene/α-olefin/aromatic vinvl<br>
compound random copolymer).<br>
The a-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer<br>
for use in the second lubricating oil composition of the invention, however, has an intrinsic viscosity [ŋ] , as<br><br>
measured in decalin at 135 °C, of 0.1 to 5.0 dl/g, preferably 0.5 to 3.0 dl/g.<br>
The amount of the α-olerm/aromatic vinyl compound<br>
random copolymer functioning as the viscosity index improver is in the range of 1.0 to 50.0 parts by weight, preferably 2.0 to 30.0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the base oil.<br>
The second lubricating oil composition of the invention has excellent lubricating oil properties because the base oil comprising the mineral oil and/or the hydrocarbon synthetic oil is blended with the α-<br>
olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer functioning as the base oil or the viscosity index improver.<br>
Next, the third lubricating oil composition and the lubricating oil compatibility improver according to the invention are described.<br>
The third lubricating oil composition of the invention comprises a base oil, which comprises a mineral oil and/or a hydrocarbon synthetic oil, a specific lov-molecular weight α-olefin/aromatic vinyl compound random copolymer<br>
functioning as a compatibility improver, and a lubricating oil additive.<br>
The lubricating oil compatibility improver according to the invention is the same α-olefin/aromatic vinyl<br>
compound random copolymer as used for forming the third lubricating oil composition of the invention.<br><br>
Examples of the base oils include the aforesaid mineral oils and hydrocarbon synthetic oils employable as the base oil of the second lubricating' oil composition.<br>
α-Olefin/aromatic vinvl comnound random copolymer<br>

Moreover, the fluidity improver has excellent lubricating properties.  By virtue of these advantageous properties, fuel supply and air supply can be stabilized to achieve safety operation, and abrasion of fuel injection nozzles can be inhibited.<br>
Accordingly, the fuel oil composition of the invention is prevented from viscosity increase of the middle fraction fuel oil and is lowered in the cold filter plugging point and the pour point.  Besides, the fuel oil composition contributes to inhibition of abrasion of fuel injection nozzles.<br>
