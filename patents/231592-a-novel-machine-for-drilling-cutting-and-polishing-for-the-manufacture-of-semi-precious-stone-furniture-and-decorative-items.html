				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel machine for drilling, cutting and polishing for the manufacture of semi-precious stone furniture and decorative items.<br>
The novel machine of the present invention is useful for polishing, cutting to any shape or size of stone materials like paper weight, pen stand, flower pot, sofa set, beds, wall clocks, ash tray. The machine provides good finishing to the article. Earlier machines developed were for a particular processing like polishing or cutting or drilling. The novel machine is capable of multi tasking and multi processing can be done in a single machine.<br>
Various kinds of stones for furniture and decorative as well as utilitarian value is in great demand. The use of same type of stone has increased during the last 20 years. The increasing consumption of stone required proper machine for cutting, drilling and polishing techniques of these stones. The common man will continue to use stone in many parts of the country in the hilly areas in particular, in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the tribal belt of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal and in coastal Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Orissa. Stone is not only locally available, but is also a highly environment friendly and energy efficient and these reasons alone will continue to be the preferred material of general use. In spite of this no effective machines for multi tasking such as polishing, cutting and cutting operation is available. Generally in all stone industries, separate machines are used for different purposes like cutting, polishing and grinding. Compact ,machine which can provide all these operations has not been developed so far. No such stone processing machine has been developed where the 5 operations such as cutting, grinding, drilling, polishing and ground polishing can be carried out.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel machine for drilling, cutting and polishing for the manufacture of semi-precious stone furniture and decorative items which obviates the draw backs as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel machine for processing in which all the five operations like cutting, drilling, polishing grinding and floor polishing can be carried out instead of using separate machines for each of the operations.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a stone processing machine useful for rural and cottage industry because of low cost and simple operation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a cost effective stone processing machine for rural industries.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a stone processing machine with low electricity consumiption.<br>
The novel machine of the present invention can effectively carry out operations such as drilling, cutting, grinding, polishing and also ground / floor polishing. In the machine of the present invention there is only one prime mover such as an electric motor, thus resulting in lower energy requirement. The singular prime mover is used in an innovative manner to transmit rotational movement to carry out at least two of the functions such as drilling, polishing, cutting / grinding simultaneously through inter connections between the prime mover and the individual processing tools in such a manner that they function in unison.<br>
Figure. 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification shows front view of the machine of the present invention. Fig. 2 shows the side view of the machine of the present invention. The description of various parts of the novel machine as per serial numbers in the figures are given below :<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention the coolant used is oil/water.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the novel machine may be provided with the following specifications:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The novelty of the machine of the present invention provides for a multifunctional, drilling, cutting, polishing and bi-directional working. The novel machine of the present invention incorporates the inventive steps such as spring loaded clutch mounted motor which enables bi-directional working and drill<br>
assembly case mounted on vertical shaft by means of bearings and clamp which enables multi functionality.<br>
Different rotation per minute is required for various operations of a stone processing machine like cutting, drilling, polishing and grinding etc. The machine is multifunctional with variable RPM, which can be used for different purpose as follows: <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Another feature of the machine is bi-directional(horizontal and vertical) cutting facility of the machine. Lower end of the drilling shaft may be used for the drilling and polishing of center table, corner table, sofa, single and double bed stone upto 8 feet length. Upper end may be used for leather polish and grinding of paper weight, ash trays pen stand and upto 4"(|&gt; agate pieces which are to be used in Sofa and single and double bed horizontal partition of the machine.
