"A    METHOD     FOR    MEASURING     DNA     POLYMERIZATION    AND APPLICATIONS OF THE METHOD"<br>
CAVIDI TECH AB, a Swedish corporation of Uppsala Science Park, SE-751 83 Uppsala, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>
1<br>
method for measuring DNA polymerization and applications of the method.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for measuring DNA polymerization and applications of the method. More precisely, the invention relates to a method for measuring <br>
5     DNA-dependent DNA polymerization. Background<br>
The latest decades have experienced a rapid development of new methods for measurement of reverse transcription, RNA dependent DNA polymerization. The more complex issue concerning methods for quantification of DNA dependent DNA <br>
10     	polymerization has so far received much less attention.<br>
The classic DNA polymerase activity assays involve use of DNAse treated DNA ("activated DNA") as primer / template and incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into DNA (Aposhian and Kornberg 1962). Measurement of acid preciptable radioactivity allows calculation of the amount of nucleotides incorporated and the number of enzyme units <br>
15     present. However, use of radioactivity is currently restricted and discouraged in many<br>
laboratories and there is due to this a general trend away from radioactivity-based techniques.<br>
For DNA polymerases a commercial assay based on ELISA detection of<br>
digoxigenine labeled nucleotides incorporated in newly made DNA is available (Roche<br>
Molecular Biochemicals Cat. no 1468120, US5635350). This assay is hampered by the use of<br>
20         two different nucleotide substrate analogues with bulky groups, digoxigenine as label and<br>
            biotin for product immobilization. As a result the polymerization reaction velocity and<br>
             subsequent detection sensitivity is reduced. The utilization of substrate analogues with highly<br>
              deviating kinetic properties makes this system less relevant for studies of drug susceptibility<br>
              of different polymerases.<br>
25	Another more attractive alternative method is a fluorescence-based assay for<br>
DNA polymerase holoenzyme, based on the specific reaction of the dye PicoGreen with double-stranded DNA (Seville et all 1996). The latter process has recently been modified to make it suitable for a broader range of different DNA polymerizing enzymes (Tveit and Kristensen 2001). This assay is technically simple and based on the utilization of natural <br>
30     nucleotides. The detection sensitivity is, however, still in the same range as the classic<br>
radioactive DNA polymerase assay and the applications described demonstrates a detection range of 0.05-0.5 U DNA polymerase / sample.<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>
2<br>
HIV therapy today is based on multidrug therapy. The regimens are based on combinations of all three types of drugs available: nucleoside analogues, non-nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors. The strategy is to minimize the probability for a mutant virus to survive.<br>
The reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are either nucleoside analogues or non-nucleoside analogues. The non-nucleoside inhibitors bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the RT enzyme close to, but not contiguous with,, the active site. HTV-1 replication is inhibited allosterically by displacing the catalytic aspartate residues relative to the polymerase binding site.<br>
The nucleoside inhibitors used today terminates the DNA chain elongation as they lack a 3'-hydroxyl group. Prolonged therapy with nucleoside inhibitors commonly leads to the development of resistant virus. This process is associated with the gradual appearance of mutations in the virus pol gene, each leading to defined amino acid substitutions (for a review see Vandamme et al 1998). The effects of these substitutions at the enzymatic levels is complicated and includes enhancement of a primitive DNA editing function. This reaction is nucleotide dependent and produces dinucleoside polyphosphate and an extendible DNA 3'end .(Arion et al 1998, Meyer et al 1999).<br>
The HTV-l RT as well as other reverse transcriptases perform three different enzymatic reactions: RNA-dependent DNA polymerization, DNA-dependent DNA polymerization, and degradation of RNA in the DNA-RNA hybrid (RNase H). The HTV â€¢ reverse transcriptase, encoded by the pol gene, is a heterodimer consisting of a p66 and a p51 subunit. Both RNA-dependent DNA polymerization and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization are performed by the same active site localized in the p66 subunit (for a review see Goff 1990). The reaction mechanism of these drugs has mainly been defined according to their action on the RNA-dependent DNA polymerization reaction. The effect on the DNA-dependent DNA polymerization reaction is comparatively less studied.<br>
Provided that the reaction mechanism and the active metabolized drug is known and available, phenotypic virus drug susceptibility could be determined at the enzyme level. Depending on the capacity of the enzyme assays and the virus isolation techniques used, the drug sensitivity testing can theoretically be done either on supematants from virus culture propagation, the primary virus isolation or on virus preparations recovered directly from the patients. Conventional RT activity assay is performed by utilizing an artificial template-primer construction and labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphate as nucleotide substrate. The template / primer pair poly(rA-) /oligo(dT) is the most efficient and most used combination for<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>
3<br>
..determination of HTV as well as for other retroviral RTs. A drawback of this type of assay ""when drug.sensitivity testing is concerned, is that only non-nucleoside analogues or analogues that can base pair with rA can be tested. Analogues to the other nucleotide bases will require an assay based on a variable polymer template. RNA polymers containing pyrimidine bases are notoriously sensitive to RNases and in practice not compatible with biological samples. It would therefore be advantageous to base a polymerase assay intended for drag sensivity testing on a variable DNA template, provided that the assay system gives results that correlate with those from inhibition of reverse transcription and classic phenotypic drug resistance tests.<br>
HTV therapy used today is only one example of the potency of DNA polymerase inhibitors. The current situation concerning resistance development among bacteria and other microorganisms motivates the search for new classes of antimicrobial drugs. DNA polymerases are one. of the major targets during this effort. As such there is a great demand for technically simple polymerase assays, which do not cause potential environmental hazards and can be applied for drug screening towards a broad range of microbial DNA polymerase isozymes. The toxicity of the drug leads found must further be evaluated towards the corresponding mammalian DNA polymerases.<br>
Quantification of proliferation associated polymerases such as polymerase -a and -5 can be used for monitoring cell proliferation. It may be mentioned in this context that the serum levels of thymidine kinase, another cell proliferation associated enzyme, are currently used for prognosis and classification of malignant disease (US4637977). Phosphorylation of thymidine is just one of the two intracellular synthetic pathways, which provides thymidine triphosphate for DNA synthesis. Measurement of the DNA polymerase itself has the potential to give a more correct estimation of total DNA synthesis compared to thymidine kinase activity or thymidine incorporation.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a non-radioactive DNA polymerase assay in microtiter plate format enabling colorimetric or fluorimetric product detection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment it utilizes, as nucleoside triphosphate substrate, 5-bromodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP). The difference in Van der Waals' radius between the 5' position bromine in BrdUTP and the 5' position methyl group in thymidine triphosphate is minimal (1.95 A compared to 2.0 A) and the enzyme kinetic properties of<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/0M55<br>
4<br>
! these two nucleotides are quite similar. The method can be aromatized and have a detection range down to 3nU polymerase activity /sample.<br>
One of the applications of the present invention is drug susceptibility testing. All anti-retroviral drugs approved hitherto interfere with the enzymatic reaction of either the viral<br>
5     	protease or the RT. There are in addition candidate drugs in the pipeline which affect the function of the retroviral integrase.<br>
In particular, the presentinvention provides a procedure to measure a broad range of different DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. It has proved suitable even for studies of highly processive DNA polymerase systems in spite of the comparatively short template used. The <br>
10     	usefulness for determination of the activity of bacterial polymerase I and m, mammalian DNA polymerase a, p and y, a proliferation associated polymerase activity in human serum and DNA dependent DNA polymerization by HTV RT is demonstrated, but the method can be used for studies of virtually all viral and cellular DNA polymerases. One of the features that distinguish the present DNA polymerase assay from previous art is its outstanding sensitivity, <br>
15     	which makes detection of down to 3nU E. coli DNA polymerase I activity feasible.<br>
Thus, one aspect of the invention is directed to a method for measuring DNA dependent DNA polymerisation in a biological sample, comprising the steps of<br>
		a)  providing a primer with a single stranded short specific sequence, which<br>
         is unable to base pair internally, bound to a solid phase,<br>
20	b)  contacting the primer construct with a reaction mixture containing a<br>
	single stranded deoxy nucleotide template with a part of the sequence<br>
complementary to the primer and the four deoxy nucleoside<br>
triphosphates, one of which is modified so that it is specifically<br>
recognized by a labeled antibody<br>
25	c)   adding a biological sample comprising the DNA polymerase to the<br>
mixture of b),<br>
d)	allowing the polymerase reaction to proceed,<br>
e)	incubating the immobilized reaction product resulting from d) with the labeled antibody,<br>
30	f)   detecting the amount of bound labeled antibody with the aid of the label<br>
used, and <br>
g)  measuring the amount of incorporated modified deoxynucleotide, as a measure of the DNA polymerization, with the aid of the label of the bound antibody.<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>
In an embodiment the DNA polymerization is made by a retrovirus reverse transcriptase (RT), such as human immunodeficiency virus (HTV) RT.<br>
In another embodiment the modified deoxy nucleoside triphosphate is <br>
5        -5     	bromodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP) and the labeled antibody is an alkaline phosphatase (Ap) conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method accordmg to the invention, the measured DNA polymerisation is used for drug susceptibility testing.<br>
The drug susceptibility testing is performed to evaluate if a certain drug is <br>
10     	effective in a mammalian individual, and the result may be used for selecting drug treatment therapy for that individual. In practice, the individual will be subjected to testing at several points of time to monitor the development of drug treatment in said individual.<br>
The invention is also directed to a commercial package comprising written and/or data carrier instructions for measuring DNA-dependent DNA polymerisation according the. <br>
15     invention. The package will comprise at least the following items:<br>
a)	a primer with a single stranded short specific sequence, which is unable to base pair internally, bound to a solid phase,<br>
b)	a single stranded deoxynucleotide template with a part of the sequence complementary to the primer in a),<br>
20 	c)  the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, one of which is modified so that<br>
it is specifically recognized by a labeled antibody, and d)  the labelled antibody that recognizes the modified deoxynucleoside triphosphate in c). The invention will now be illustrated by the following unlimiting description of <br>

15     Description of embodiments<br>
Production of primer coated microliter plates<br>
l-ethyl-3-(3-dimetylamino-propyl)carboimide hydrochloride (final concentration 10 mg / ml) was added to a 100 mM l-Methylimidazole buffer (pH 7.0) and the mixture was used to dilute the primer construct to a final concentration of 1 ug /ml. 100 ul of the primer solution was<br>
20     aliquoted to each well of a microtiter plate consisting of Nalge Nunc<br>
NucleoLinkÂ® transparent strips (Cat no 248259). The plates were incubated 6-8 hours at 37 Â°C, washed thoroughly in 2M NaOH with 2 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and soaked in three 5 L vials with water. Residual fluid in the wells was removed by tapping the plates upside down on absorbing cloth or paper. The plates were allowed to dry for 30 min at<br>
25     room temperature and finally frozen for storage at - 20 Â°C. Protocol for DNA-polymerase assay.<br>
The DNA-polymerase assay is based on a short primer with a specific sequence that is covalently bound to the wells of a 96 well microtiter plate. The reaction mixture contains a single stranded deoxynucleotide template with a part of the sequence <br>
30     complementary to the primer and the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Thymidine<br>
triphosphate is, however, replaced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP). The amount of bromodeoxyuridine monophosphate (BrdUMP) incorporated into DNA during the<br><br>
,   WO 02/103059	PCT/SE02/01155<br>
7<br>
polymerase reaction, is detected with an alkaline phosphatase (Ap) conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. An Ap substrate, 4-methyiumbelliferyl phosphate, is used for fluorimetric product detection.<br>
100 ul of DNA polymerase reaction mixture was added to each well of the primer coated microtiter plates. The samples were diluted in DNA polymerase base buffer and the polymerase reaction was initiated by transferring 50 ul sample dilution to each well on the plate. The microtiter plate was incubated at 33 Â°C and reaction was terminated after indicated times by washing the plate in 3 mM borate buffer (pH 8.9) with 1.5 % (v/v)octophenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100). Usually two incubation times, 4 hours and over night (16 hours), were used to check the linearity of the polymerization reaction. The plates were washed thoroughly in 2M NaOH with 2 mM EDTA and soaked in three 5 L vials with water.<br>
Next the plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 33 Â°C with 100 u.1 alkaline phosphatase (Ap) conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody diluted to 4.8 ug/ml in 25 mM (bis(2-HyaVoxyethyl]iminotris[hydroxymemyl]methane;2a-bis[2-Hydroxyemyl]amino-2-[hydroxymethyl]-1,3-propanediol) (Bis Tris) buffer (pH 7.2) with 50 mM NaCl, 37.5 mM (NTL^SO^ 1 mg/ ml Dextran sulphate, 1 % TritonX-100 and 25 mg/ ml Sigma non-fat dried milk.<br>
The plates were thereafter washed again in 3 mM borate buffer (pH 8.9) with 1.5 % (v/v) TritonX-100 to remove unbound labeled antibody. The alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate substrate dissolved in Tris-buffer (pH 8.9). Fluorescence was read at 460 nm with a Wallac Victor 2 reader at defined intervals (excitation 355 nm). Protocol for determination of inhibition of second strand synthesis on variable DNA template.<br>
The inhibition studies were performed in a modified DNA polymerase assay. The drugs were serially diluted in five steps and 25 ul aliquots were transferred to each well in the microtiter plate, mixed with 100 ul DNA polymerase reaction mixture and the enzyme reaction was initiated by addition of 25 ul enzyme dilution. Non-nucleoside analogues were studied at standard reaction conditions while the concentration of all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) were reduced to luM in the studies of dNTP competing inhibitors. The polymerase reaction was allowed to proceed over-night (16-24 hours at 33Â°C). Thereafter the reaction was terminated by a wash of the plate. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of drug giving 50% inhibition of the polymerase activity studied.<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/O1155<br>
8 Protocol for determination of RT activity,<br>
A modification of the colorimetric RT assay (CavidiÂ® Lenti RT activity kit), available from Cavidi Tech, Uppsala, Sweden was used for the determination of the level of RT activity in the virus preparations studied. The method has been described (Ekstrand at al 1996). In short, poly(rA) covalently bound to the wells of a 96 well microtiter plate serves as template for the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP) during the reverse transcription step at 33Â°C. The amount of bromodeoxyuridine monophosphate (BrdUMP) incorporated into DNA, is detected with an alkaline phosphatase (Ap) conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. An Ap substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, is finally used for fiuorimetrie detection . Protocol for determination of inhibition of reverse transcription.<br>
The inhibition studies were performed in a modified Cavidi HS-kit Lenti RT assay. The inhibitors were serially diluted in five steps and 25 ul aliquots were transferred, to each well in the microtiter plate, mixed with 100 ul RT reaction mixture and the enzyme reaction was initiated by addition of 50 ul enzyme dilution. The final nucleoside triphosphate substrate (BrdUTP) concentration was 16 uM and the primer (odT22) amount 12 ng per well. The RT reaction was allowed to proceed overnight (16-24 hours ait 33Â°C). Thereafter the reaction was terminated by a wash of the plate. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of drug giving 50% inhibition of the RT activity studied.<br>
Protocol for isolation of viral RT from material which contains RT blocking antibodies, based on destruction of soluble cellular enzymes followed by isolation of viral RT from mini columns.<br>
1) Label the 4.5ml plastic tubes to be used. Place them in a Nalgene box. Add 1 ml of sample (e.g. EDTA plasma from HTV infected individuals) to each labeled tube. Add 100 u.1 of a 66 mM solution of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in buffered water, vortex and incubate the samples for one hour at room temperature.<br>
The activity of the free plasma enzymes is destroyed during this procedure while the enzymes contained within the virions remain intact. The virions can then be purified from 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), enzyme activity blocking antibodies and other substances that may interfere with quantification of viral RT by several separation procedures. The protocol below is based on the use of FractogelÂ® EMD TMAE Hicap gel. 2)   Suspend the separation gel carefully and transfer 1500 u.1 gel slurry to each sample pre-treatment tube.<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155.<br>
9<br>
3)  Incubate the samples with the gel slurry for 90 minutes at room temperature with the tubes lying down horizontally on an orbital shaker.<br>
4)	Label the desired amount of 10 ml plastic mini columns to identify the samples being<br>
analyzed. Mount the columns in a column washing device i.e. a Supelco Visiprep solid<br>
phase extraction vacuum manifold. Transfer the contents in the binding tubes to their<br>
corresponding columns. Before transfer vortex the tube briefly to evenly distribute the gel.<br>
5)	When all the columns are filled, apply the vacuum and suck the gels dry. Turn off the<br>
vacuum and start the washing by filling each column with 9 ml buffer A. When all<br>
columns have been filled, apply the vacuum and suck the gels dry.<br>
6)	  Repeat step 5 three more times, giving a total of four washes. Suck the gels dry after each<br>
wash. After sucking the gels dry after the fourth wash, turn off the vacuum and proceed to<br>
step 7.<br>
The washing step removes unbound RT blocking antibodies and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) from the system.<br>
7)	Add to all dry gels 9 ml of conditioning buffer (B). After one minute apply vacuum and suck the gels dry.<br>
8)	Repeat step 7. Before turning off the vacuum check that all conditioning buffer (B) has been removed from all gels.<br>
9)	Lift off the upper part of the column wash device. Mount the tube holder with the labeled tubes into a clean container. Refit the upper part of the device. Control that the small tubings from each column go down in their corresponding tubes.<br>
10)	Add 600 p.1 lysis buffer (C) to each column. Let the buffer stand in the column for five minutes. Then apply the vacuum slowly and suck the gels dry. This will in each tube give approximately 600 p.1 of virus lysate from the connected gel.<br>
The RT activity recovered in the lysates from step 10 are essentially free from RT blocking antibodies, drugs and cellular polymerase activity, and can be quantified with a sensitive RT activity assay, i.e. the Cavidi HS-kit Lenti RT, which is based on the method described by Ekstrand et al [7]. 25 ul lysate obtained according to the current protocol is sufficient for determination of the RT activity in the sample. The Remaining 575 p.1 sample should be frozen at -70 Â°C or below for later use in the drug sensitivity test.<br><br>

Note: RT enzymes that are not sensitive to cystein modifying agents e.g. wild type HTV 1 RT can optionally be assayed in the presence of up to 5 mM 5,5'-dithiobis-{2-nitrobenzoic acid). Sensitive enzymes such as MULV RT and RT from certain therapy resistant HTV 1 strains (containing e.g. the mutation Yl 81C) on the other hand require addition of a sulfhydryl <br>

Example 1. Utilization of different templates for second strand synthesis by HTV RT.<br>
Two step dilution series of indicated template constructs starting from 200 ng / ml were  included in each well of mictrotiter plates with immobilized primer according to "Production of primer coated microtiter plates ". 100 fg recombinant HTV 1 RT was added to <br>
30     	each well and the duration of the RT reaction was 18 hours. The polymerase activity on each template was determined according to "Protocol for DNA-polymerase assay" using DNA polymerase /and Retro DNA polymerase base buffer. 50 mM NaCl or alternatively 100 mM was used during the binding of anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. The activities found were<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>

  plotted towards concentration of template and the maximal signal achieved for each template type were calculated from the plateau value of respective graph.<br>
The results are summarized in Table 1. A clear correlation was found between the length of the A-tail and maximal signal obtainable in the polymerase assay. The length of the A-tail did also affect the ability of the antibody used for product detection to bind at increased ionic strength.<br>
Example 2. Effects of template sequence on inhibition of DNA polymerase III with TMAU.<br>
6-anilinouracils are selective inhibitors of DNA polymerase III from gram-positive bacteria. The anilinouracil molecule inhibits its polymerase LI target by sequestering it into an inactive DNA-drug-protein complex (Tarantino et al 1990). The drug TMAU can be regarded as an analogue to GTP. The inhibitory capacity of indicated concentrations of TMAU towards 1.25 ng / well recombinant DNA polymerase IK was determined according to "Protocol for determination of inhibition of second strand synthesis on variable DNA template" utilizing either (CTGA)6-A12 (SEQ ID NO: 10) (â– ) or (CTG)6-A3 (SEQ ID NO: 11) (A,) as template. The polymerase reaction time was one hour and the GTP concentration in the DNA polymerase m reaction mixture was reduced to 2.5 uM. The polymerase activities obtained on indicated template were recalculated into % of the activities found with the same polymerase incubated in absence of inhibitor.<br>
The results are depicted in Figure. 1. This highly specific inhibitor exhibited varying inhibitory capacity depending on the sequence of the template used. The current invention provides a system were the DNA template used easily can be changed to account for the specific conditions required by the enzyme or inhibitor studied.<br>
Example 3. Detection sensitivity of the DNA polymerase assay.<br>
The activity of serial dilutions of: HTV 1 wild type RT (â™¦), mammalian DNA polymerase P (â€¢) and E. coli DNA polymerase I (A) were measured according to "Protocol for DNA-polymerase assay" utilizing base buffers optimized for indicated enzyme. The polymerase reaction time used was over-night (18 hours). The results are depicted in Figure 2. Each of the three enzyme preparations displayed a linear relationship between amount of enzyme used and amount of product recovered. The assay background was 3800 rfu/ hour. Utilizing double background as cut-off value for significant signal detection it was possible to<br><br>

i detect down to 1 OntX HIV 1 wild type RT, 6 nil mamalian DNA polymerase p* and 3nU E. coli DNA polymerase I.<br>
Example 4. The activity of five DNA polymerases in different assay systems.<br>
The activity of serial dilutions of DNA polymerase a, DNA polymerase (3, DNA <br>
5     	polymerase y, serum from a patient suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and HTV-l RT were measured according to "Protocol for DNA-polymerase assay" and "Protocolfor determination of RT activity" using reaction solutions based on indicated polymerase base buffers. The polymerase reaction time used was 2 hours. The activities found were recalculated into % of the activity on variable DNA template at the optimal reaction<br>
10     conditions for each enzyme. The results are shown in Table 2. Each of the five en2yme preparations investigated had their individual preferences concerning optimal reaction conditions. DNA polymerase a and the human serum polymerase, however, displayed a similar pattern. Only HTV-l RT and DNA. polymerase y gave a significant activity in the reverse transcriptase assay.<br>
15     Example 5. Demonstration of the ability of the DNA polymerase assay to measure inhibition by the dideoxy analogues to all the four DNA bases.<br>
The inhibitory capacity of indicated concentrations of ddATP (â– ), ddGTT (â™¦), ddCTP (â€¢) and ddTTP (A) towards the activity of 80 fg recombinant wild type HTV 1 RT was determined according to ilProtocolfor determination of inhibition of second strand<br>
20     	synthesis on variable DNA template". The polymerase activity at each inhibitor concentration was recalculated into % of the activity of a control in absence of inhibitor. The results are depicted in Figure 3.<br>
The polymerase reaction utilizing the template (CTGA)6-Ai2 (SEQ ID NO: 10) was found sensitive to inhibition by the dideoxy analogues to all the four DNA bases. The <br>
25     IC50 values found varied from 20 nM for ddCTP to 80 nM for ddATP.<br>
Example 6. Comparison of the effect of non-nucleoside inhibitors on first and second strand DNA synthesis by HIV 1 RT.<br>
The effects of three non-nucleoside inhibitors on indicated recombinant HTV 1 RT were determined according to "Protocol for determination of inhibition of second strand<br>
30    	 synthesis on variable DNA template" using DNA polymerase /and Retro DNA polymerase base buffer and "Protocol for determination of inhibition of reverse transcrivtion "<br><br>
WO 02/103039	PCT/SE02/01155<br>

    respectively. The duration of the polymerization reactions were 19 hours for the second strand synthesis on (GTGA)6-Ai2 (SEQ ID NO: 10) and 2 hours for the first strand synthesis on prA respectively. The RT activities obtained were recalculated into % of the activities found with the same RT incubated in absence of inhibitor.<br>
The results are summarized in Table 3. Both assay systems had the capacity to distinguish between resistant (Y181C, V179D) and sensitive RT enzymes. The IC50 values for any of the inhibitors was not significantly affected of a five fold difference in the amount of enzyme used in any of the two assay systems. Further there was no significant difference between the IC50 values achieved by measuring inhibition of first or second strand DNA synthesis.<br>
Example 7. Demonstration of the biochemical mechanism underlying resistance to the antiviral drug tenofovir.<br>
Prolonged therapy of HTV infected individuals with nucleoside analogues leads to the development of resistant virus. This process is associated with the gradual appearance of mutations in the viral pol gene. The effects of these substitutions at the enzymatic levels are complicated and include enhancement of a primitive DNA editing function. This reaction is nucleotide dependent and produces dinucleoside polyphosphate and an extendible DNA 3'end.<br>
The effects of serial dilutions of tenofovir triphosphate on 4 pg /well of indicated recombinant HIV 1 RT were determined according to "Protocol for determination of inhibition of second strand synthesis on variable DNA template" utilizing standard reaction solution based on DNA polymerase /and Retro DNA polymerase base buffer and the same reaction solution supplemented with ATP. The duration of the polymerization reactions was 19 hours. The RT activities obtained were recalculated into % of the activity of the same RT incubated in absence of inhibitor. Figure 4 shows the resuts.<br>
