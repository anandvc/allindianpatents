Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a polyolefin composition containing a crystalline propylene homopolymer having a high melt flow rate  and an olefin polymer composition, as well as fiber and non-woven fabric prepared therefrom. Non-woven fabrics prepared from fibers of this polyolefin composition exhibit a desirable combination of acceptable tensile strength, superior cross-directional fabric elongation, good processability, and improved fabric softness and drape.<br>
International Patent Application WO 99/14261 discloses compositions comprising a blend of a linear low density polyethylene and a low viscosity propylene polymer having utility in the production of stretch wrap films.<br>
European Patent Application No. 1059332 discloses bimodal polypropylene blends having high dispersion index and showing a good balance between melt strength and drawability in the preparation of films and fibers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,529,845 discloses fibers and non-woven fabrics made from compositions having a high content of polypropylene of low melt flow rate which require a relatively high processing tanperature.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,460,884 discloses a non-woven fabric prepared from a polyolefin composition having a highly crystalline propylene homopolymer as a major component and a heterophasic ethylene/propylene random copolymer as a minor component. The non-woven fabric is said to be very strong but yet soft in comparison to comparable non-woven fabrics.<br>
Non-woven fabrics have gained acceptance in various products, including diapers, disposable medical products and personal hygiene products. Non-woven fabrics destined for use in these applications may be subjected to post-manufacturing finishing operations such as coating or stretching. Fabrics having high tensile strength can be difficult to process, and also may exhibit inadequate suppleness ("drape") as well as reduced fabric elongation.<br>
Non-woven fabrics prepared from polyolefin fibers having a high melt flow rate have been proposed. Thus, U.S. Patent No. 5,529,850 discloses fibers and non-woven furies produced food crystalline propylene polymers and copolymers having a polydispersity index of 2.5 to 3,7 and a melt flow rate of from 600 to 2000 g/10 minutes.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a polyolefin composition capable of being formed into fibers of fine diameter.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a polyolefin fiber capable of being formed into a non-woven fabric having a combination of desirable properties, including acceptable tensile strength, superior cross-directional fabric elongation, good processability, and improved fabric softness and drape.<br><br>
A feature of this invention is a polyolefin composition which includes an as-polymerized, high melt flow rate (MKR) propylene homopolymer and a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene and/or a C4.-io alpha-olefin.<br>
Snottier feature of this invention is a fiber prepared from &amp;is polyolefin composition and which has a diameter of from 15 to 23 microns.<br>
Yet another feature of this invention is a nonwoven fabric prepared from this polyolefm fiber and which has superior cross-directiOBal fabric elongation, as measured by peak tensile elongation,<br>
An advantage of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention U that it h^ improved processability, softness and drape. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>

The catalysts that can be used to produce the polymer composition of the present invention aie well known in patent literature. Particularly suited are the catalysts described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,339,054, 5,539,067 and 5,618,771. Other examples of catalysts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,472,524 and 4,473,660-<br>
The above mentioned catalysts used in the polymerization comprise the product of the reactioQ between:<br><br>
a)	a solid component, containing a titanixmi compound and an electron-donor compound (internal electron donor) supported on magnesium chloride in active form,<br>

Illustrative examples of ethers whose structures conform to formula (1) include 2^-diphenyl-lj3-dimethox)propane, 2,2-diben2:yl-l,3-dimethoxypropane, 2,2-bis(cyclohexylmethyl) 1,3-diuiethoxypropane, 1,3-bix(methoxymethyi)cyclohexane and 2,2'-bix(methoxymethyl)norboniane, 2-methyl-2-isopfopyl-l,3-dimeth-oxypropane, 2,2-diisobutyl-l,3-diinethoxypropane, and 2-isopropyl-2-cyclopentyl-l,3-diinethoxy propane. The diethers of the type described are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,095,153, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
The preparation of the described catalyst components is done according to various methods. One of them consists of milling or co-milling the magnesium dihaiide (used in the anhydrous state containing less than 1% water), together with the titanium compound, and the electron-donor compound under conditions where the magnesium dihaiide is activated; the milled product is then treated one or more times with excess TiCU at temperatures from 80 to 135° C, and subsequently washed repeatedly with a hydrocarbon (hexane, for example) until the chlorine ions have disappeared from the wash waters. The electron-donor compound may also be added during the milling operation or during the treatment with excess TiCU. (if more than one treatment with excess TiCU is employed, the electron donor compound is added during the first treatment^<br>
According to another method the anhydrous magnesium halide is preactivated according to known methods, and then treated one or more times with excess TiCU containing the electron-donor compound in solution. In this, case the operation also takes place at a temperature from 80 to 135° C. Optionally, the TiCU treatment is repeated. The solid is then washed with hexane or other solvents to eliminate all traces of unreacted TiCU-The elecfron-donor compound may also be added during the treatment with excess TiCLi, preferably during the first treatment, if more than one treatment with excess TiCl* is used.<br>
According to another method, a MgCljuKOH adduct (particularly in the form of spherical particles) where n is generally a number ranging from 1 to 3 and ROH is ethanol, butanol or isobutanol, is treated one or more times with excess TiCU containing the electron-donor compound in solution. The electron-donor compound may also be added during the treatment with excess TiCU, preferably during the first treatment, if more than one treatment<br><br>
with excess TiClj is used. The reaction temperature generally ranges firom 80 to 120 °C. After the reaction the solid is isolated and treated one or more times with TiCU, and then washed with a hydrocarbon solvent until all traces of unreacted TiCU have been eliminated.<br>
According to yet another method, magnesium alcoholates and chloroalcoholates (the chloroalcoholates can be prepared according to U.S. Patent No. 4,220,554) are treated one or more times with excess TiCLi containing the electron-donor compound in solution, operating under the same conditions ahready described. The electron-donor compound may also be added during the treatment with excess TiCLt, preferably during the first treatment, if more than one treatment with excess TiCU is used.<br>
The titanium compound in the solid catalyst component, expressed as Ti content, is generally present in the amount ranging fi-om 0.5 to 10% by weight, and the quantity of the electron-donor compound that remains set on the soHd magnesium dihalide usually ranges from 5 to 20% in moles with respect to the magnesium dihalide.<br>
Titanium compounds which can be used for the preparation of catalyst components are halides or halogen alcoholates. Titanium tetrachloride is the preferred compound. Satisfactory resuhs are obtained also with titanium trihalides, particularly TiCljHR (HR=Hydrogen Reduced), TiCUARA (ARA=AIuminum Reduced and Activated), and with titanium hahde alcoholates such as TiCUOR, where R is a phenyl radical.<br>
The preparations indicated above lead to the formation of activated magnesium dihaUde. Besides the ones ahready mentioned, other reactions are known in the art which lead to the formation of activated magnesium dihalides starting from magnesium compounds which are different from the magnesium haUdes, such as magnesium carboxylates.<br>
The active form of magnesium halides in the sohd catalj^t component can be recognized by the fact that in the X-ray spectrum of the catalyst component the major intensity reflection presents a width at half-peak at least greater than 30% with respect to the major intensity reflection which appears in the spectrum of the nonactivated magnesium dihahde, or by the fact that the major intensity reflection (which appears in the spectrum of the nonactivated magnesium hahdes, having a surface area smaller than 3 mVg) is absent and in its place there is a halo with the maximum intensity shifted with respect to the position of<br><br>
the maximum intensity reflection of the nonactivated magnesium dihalide. The most active forms of magnesium halide are those where the X-ray spectrum shows a halo.<br>
Among the magnesium dihalides, the magnesium chloride is the preferred compound. In the case of the most active forms of magnesium chloride, the X-ray spectrum of the catalyst component shows a halo instead of the reflection, which in the spectrum of the nonactivated magnesium chloride is situated at the distance of 2.56 A.<br>
As cocatalysts (b), one preferably uses the trialkyl aluminum compounds, such as Al-tiiethyl, Al-triisobutyl and Al-tri-n-butyl.<br>
Other examples of cocatalysts (b) are the linear or cyclic Al-alkyl compounds containing two or more Ai atoms bonded by means of O, or N atoms, or by SO2, SO3 or SO4 groups. Some examples of these compounds are; (C2H5)r-Al-0--Al(C2Hs)2<br>
(C2H3)2~A1-N(C6H5)-'A1(C2H5)2 (C2H5)2~A1-S02-A1-(C2H5)2<br>
CH3--[CCH3)Al-0-j„~Al(CH3)a<br>
-[{CH3)Al-0]n-<br>
wherein n is a number from 1 to 20.<br>
In general, the Al-AIkyl compoimd is present in quantities that allow the Al/Ti ratio to vary from 1 to 1000.<br>
The electron-donor compounds (c) that can be used as external electron-donors comprise the aromatic acid esters (such as alkyUc benzoates), heterocyclic compounds (such as the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and 2,6-diisopropylpiperidine), and in particular silicon compounds containing at least one Si—OR bond (where R is a hydrocarbon radical). Some examples of silicon compounds are: (tert-C^ig); Si(OCH3)2 and (C6Hs)2Si(OCH3)2- Suitable sihcon compounds are described m U.S. Patent Nos. 5,539,067 and 5,618,771 and U.S. Serial No. 08/469,735, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The 1,3-diethers of fomiula (1) are also suitable to be used as external donors. In the case that the internal donor is one of the 1,3-diethers of formula (T), the external donor can be omitted.<br><br>
The catalysts can be precontacted with small quantities of olefins (prepolymerization), maintaining the catalj^t in suspension in a hydrocarbon solvent, and polymerizing at temperatures ranging &amp;om ambient to fiCC. The quantity of polymer produced is from 0.5 to 3 times the wei^t of the catalyst.<br>

The polyolefin composition of the present invention may be manufactured into fibers and films using conventional techniques and apparatus well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, for example, the composition may be extruded through a spinnerette into a fiber or filament which is then oriented and quenched prior being wound onto a bobbin. Alternatively, the extruded fiber may be immediately formed into a non-woven fabric using known techniques such as spunbonding, meltblowing, needlepunching, air-layering etc. The term "nonjwoven fabric" means a web having a strucmre of individual fibers or threads which are interlaid, but not in a regular, repetitive manner as m a knitted fabric. The fibers of the present invention have particular utility as starting materials for the production of nonwoven fabrics.<br>
Fibers prepared fi-om the composition of the present invention typically have a fiber diameter of fi'om 15 to 23 microns, preferably 16 to 17.5 microns, and most preferably 16 to 17 microns.<br>
The spunbond process generally uses a hopper which suppUes polymer to a heated extruder, which supplies molten polymer to a spinnerette where the polymer is formed into a plurality of filaments by passing it through the holes of the spinnerette. The filaments are usually quenched with air at a low pressure, drawn, usually pneumatically, and deposited on a moving foraminous mat, belt or "forming wire" to form the nonwoven fabric. Spunbonding processing temperatures generally range &amp;om about 175°C to 320°C.<br>
"Cross-diiectional peak elongation" is the fabric elongation when fabric strength is at its peak. "Cross directional elongation" is the maximum elongation at which the fabric fails. CD elongation is higher than CD peak elongation.<br>
At a given fiber diameter, fabric elongation will generally be highest when the fabric is bonded at the optimum bonding temperature. Fabric elongation decreases with a decrease in fabric weight.<br><br>
The non-woven fabrics of tiie present invention have superior cross-diieotional fahric elongation, as measured by peak tensile elongation, and relatively low tensile strength. Thus, the nonwoveQ fabrics of the present invention preferably have a peak tensile elongation of at least 80%, still more preferably at least 100%, and most preferably a peak tensile elongation of at least 120%, as measured by ASTM D-5035, at a fabric weight of from 21 to 26 g/m^. Such non-woven fabrics will exhibit a desirable combination of processability (e.g., high melt spinning speeds of at least 4000 meters/minute at a melt temperature of 220°C) and improved "drape" when manufactured into nonwoven articles or nonwoven components of articles such as diapers, disposable medical products, e.g., hospital gowns, and personal hygiene products, e.g., sanitary napkins.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nonwoven fabric of the present invention has a relatively low tensile strength of less than 750 g/cm, as measured by ASTM D-5035. It is prefenred that the nonwoven fabric's tensile strength be less than 700 g/cm, even more preferred if the tensile strength is less than 600 g/cm, and most preferred if the tensile strength is about 350 g/cra.<br>
