Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to l-thia-3-aza-dibenzoazulene derivatives, to their pharmacologically acceptable salts and solvates, to processes and intermediates for the preparation thereof as well as to their antiinflammatory effects, especially to the inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production and the inhibition of interleukin-1 (iL-1) production as well as to their analgetic action.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Some 1,3-diaza-dibenzoazulene derivatives and salts thereof are known as a novel class of compounds having an antiinflammatory action (US 3,711,489, US 4,198,421 and CA 967,573). From the class of 1-thia-dibenzoazulenes, in the literature there are described derivatives substituted in 2-position with methyl, methyl-ketone, nitro group or with carboxylic group derivatives (Cagniant PG, C. R. Hebd. Sceances Acad. Sci., 1976, 2^3:683-686) and 1-thia-dibenzoazulene derivatives having alkyloxy substituents in 2-position (WO 01/878990), which also possess strong antiinflammatory action.<br>
According to our knowledge and to available literature data, derivatives of 1,8-dithia- 3-aza-dibenzoazuIenes having in 2-position an amino group are well-known (Kovtunenko VA et ah, Vkr. Khim. Zh.t 1983 45:975-978), whereas other derivatives and especially those having alkyl or some other groups, which are alkyl derivatives and intermediates for the preparation thereof, in 2-position have now been prepared and described for the first time. It has not been known either that dibenzoazulenes<br><br>
from the class of thiazoles show antiinflammatory action (inhibitors of TNF-a production, inhibitors of IL-1 production) and/or analgetic action.<br>
TNF-a is defined as a serum factor induced by endotoxin and causing tumour necrosis in vitro and in vivo (Carswell EA et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1975, 72:3666-3670). Besides an antitumour action, TNF-a also possesses numerous other biological actions important in the homeostasis of an organism and in pathophysiological conditions. The main sources of TNF-a are monocytes-macrophages, T-lymphocytes and mastocytes.<br>
The discovery that anti-TNF-a antibodies (cA2) have an action in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RAJ (Elliott M et al., Lancet, 1994, 344:1105-1110) led to an increased interest in finding novel TNF-a production inhibitors as possible potent drugs for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes in the joints. Besides in RA, TNF-a antagonists may also be used in numerous pathological conditions and diseases such as spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gout and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrom, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, glomerulonephritis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, asthma, cachexia, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive cardiac arrest, insulin resistance, lung fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, viral infections and AIDS.<br>
Some of the proofs indicating the biological importance of TNF-a were obtained by in vivo experiments in mice, in which mice gens for TNF-a or its receptor were inactivated. Such animals are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (Mori L et al, J. Immunol., 1996, /57:317S-3182) and to endotoxin-caused shock (Pfeffer K et al., Cell, 1993, 73:457-467). In animal experiments where TNF-a level was increased, a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis similar to RA occurred (Georgopoulos S et al., J.Injlamm., 1996, 46~:86-97; Keffer J et al, EMBO J., 1991, 70:4025-4031) and its<br><br>
clinical picture was alleviated by inhibitors of TNF-a production. The treatment of such inflammatory and pathological conditions usually includes the application of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs and, in more severe cases, gold salts, D-penicillinamine or methotrexate are administered. Said drugs act symptomatically, but they do not stop the pathological process. Novel approaches in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis are based upon drugs such as tenidap, leflunomide, cyclosporin, FK-506 and upon biomolecules neutralizing the TNF-a action. At present there are commercially available etanercept (Enbrcl, Immunex/Wyeth), a fusion protein of the soluble TNF-a receptor, and infliximab (Remicade, Centocor), a chimeric monoclonal human and mouse antibody. Besides in RA therapy, etanercept and infliximab are also registered for the therapy of Crohn's disease (Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2000, 9:103).<br>
In an optimal RA therapy, besides inhibition of TNF-a secretion, also the inhibition of IL-1 production is very important since IL-1 is an important cytokin in cell regulation and immunoregulation as well as in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation (Dinarello CA et ah, Rev. Infect. Disease, 1984, (5:51). Well-known biological activities of IL-1 are: activation of T-cells, induction of elevated temperature, stimulation of secretion of prostaglandine or collagenase, chemotaxia of neutrophils and reduction of iron level in plasma (Dinarello CA, J. Clinical Immunology, 1985, 5:287). Two receptors to which IL-1 may bind arc well-known: IL-1RI and IL-1RII. IL-1RI transfers a signal intracellularly, whereas IL-lRII, though situated on the cell surface, does not transfer a signal inside the cell. Since ILl-Rll binds IL-1 as well as 1L1-RI, it may act as a negative regulator of IL-1 action. Besides this mechanism of signal transfer regulation, another natural antagonist of IL-1 receptor (IL-lra) is present in cells. This protein binds to IL-1RI but does not bring about a stimulation thereof. The potency of IL-lra in stopping the signal transfer stimulated by IL-1 is not high and its concentration has to be 500 times higher than that of IL-1 in order to achieve a break in the signal transfer. Recombinant human IL-lra (Amgen) was clinically tested (Bresnihan B ct ah, Arthrit. Rheum., 1996, 39:73) and the obtained results indicated an improvement of the clinical picture in RA<br><br>
patients over a placebo. These results indicate the importance of the inhibition ofIL-I action in treating diseases such as RA where IL-1 production is disturbed. Since there exists a synergistic action of TNF-a and IL-1, dual TNF-a and IL-1 inhibitors may be used in treating conditions and diseases related to an enhanced production of TNF-a and IL-1.<br>

Some compounds of the formula I may form salts with organic or inorganic acids or bases and these are also included in the present invention.<br>
Solvates (most frequently hydrates) which may be formed by the compounds of the formula I or salts thereof are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Depending upon the nature of particular substituents, the compounds of the formula I may have geometric isomers and one or more chiral centres so that there can exist<br><br>
enantiomers or diastereoisomers. The present invention also relates to such isomers and mixtures thereof, including racemates.<br>
The present invention also relates to all possible tautomeric forms of particular compounds of the formula I.<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to the preparation of compounds of the formula I according to processes comprising:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
with the compounds of the formula VI, wherein R4 has the meaning of a leaving group;<br>
e)   for the compounds of the formula I, wherein Q, has the meaning of -C=C-,<br>
a reaction of the compounds of the formula Va, wherein Q, has the meaning of carbonyl, with phosphorous ylides.<br>
Preparation methods:<br>
a) Cyclization of ct-bromoketones of the formula III and thioamides of the formula IV is carried out by methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds (Teitei, Aust. J. Chem., 1980, 35:605-611). The reaction is carried out in an appropriate solvent such as e.g. ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, A'.A'-dimethylformamide, MN-dimethylacetamide, toluene or xylene at an elevated temperature (preferably from 50°C to 150°C). The formed tetracyclic products may be isolated by column chromatography or recrystallization from an appropriate solvent.<br><br>
The starting compounds for this reaction are already known or they are prepared by methods described for the preparation of analogous compounds: for a-bromoketones of the formula HI in e.g. US 3,711,489 or US 4,198,421, or for thioamides of the formula IV, in e.g. Kavtunenko V.A. et al., Ukr. Khim. Zk, 1983, 49:975-978. The so obtained compounds may be purified, isolated and characterized or may be subjected to a further cyclisation reaction without isolation.<br>
b) The compounds of the formula I according to the present process may be prepared by a reaction of alcohols of the formula V and of compounds of the formula VI, wherein R has the meaning of a leaving group, which may be a halogen atom (most frequently bromine, iodine or chlorine) or sulfonyloxy group (most frequently trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or /?-toluenesulfony!oxy). The condensation reaction may be carried out according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds (Menozzi G et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1997, 34:963-968 or WO 01/87890). The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 20°C to 100°C during 1 to 24 hours in a two-phase system (preferably with 50% NaOH/toluene) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst (preferably benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride, benzyl triethyl ammonium bromide, cetyl trimethyl bromide), After the treatment of the reaction mixture, the products formed are isolated by recrystallization or chromatography on a silica gel column.<br>
The starting compounds, alcohols of the formula V, may be prepared from the compounds of the formula I, wherein R has the meaning of an appropriate functional group. So, the alcohols of the formula V may be obtained by the reduction of an alkanoyl group (e.g. formyl) or alkyloxycarbonyl group (e.g. methyloxycarbonyl or ethyloxycarbonyl) by the use of metal hydrides such as lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride. Further, the alcohols of the formula IV may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding esters (in alkaline or acidic mediums).<br><br>
1 he starting compounds of the formula VI are already known or are prepared according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds.<br>
c)	Compounds of the formula I may be prepared according to the present process<br>
by reacting compounds of the formula Va, wherein L has the meaning of a leaving<br>
group as defined earlier for R4, and compounds of the formula Via, wherein Q, has<br>
the meaning of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or -C=C-. The most suitable condensation<br>
reactions are reactions of nucleophilic substitution on a saturated carbon atom as<br>
disclosed in the literature.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula Va (most frequently halides) may be obtained by halogenation (e.g. bromination or chlorination) of compounds of the formula V with the usual halogenating agents (e.g. hydrobromic acid, PBr3, SOCl2 or PC15) by processes as disclosed in the literature. The obtained compounds may be isolated or may be used without isolation as suitable intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula Via are already known or are prepared according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds.<br>
d)	The compounds of the formula I, wherein Q, has the meaning of-0-, -NH- or<br>
-S-, may be prepared by the condensation of the compounds of the formula Vb and of<br>
compounds of the formula VI, wherein R4 has the meaning of a leaving group as<br>
defined earlier. The reaction may be carried out at reaction conditions disclosed in the<br>
method b) or at conditions of the nucleophilic substitution reactions disclosed in the<br>
literature. The starting alcohols, amines or thiols may be obtained by a reaction of<br>
water, ammonia or hydrogen sulfide with compounds Va according to processes<br>
disclosed in the literature.<br><br>
e) The alcohols of the structure V may be oxidized to corresponding compounds of the formula Vb, wherein Q| has the meaning of carbonyl, which may further, by reaction with corresponding ylide reagents, result in a prolongation of the chain and in the formation of an alkenyl substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No. 20000310.<br>
Besides the above-mentioned reactions, the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by transforming other compounds of the formula I and it is to be understood that the present invention also comprises such compounds and processes. A special example of a change of a functional group is the reaction of the aldehyde group with chosen phosphorous ylides resulting in a prolongation of the chain and the formation of an alkenyl substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No. 20000310. These reactions are carried out in solvents such as benzene, toluene or hexane at elevated temperature (most frequently at boiling temperature).<br>
By reacting the compounds of the formula Va with 1-alkyne in an alkaline medium (such as sodium amide in ammonia), compounds of the formula 1, wherein Qi is -C=C-, are obtained. The reaction conditions of this process are disclosed in the literature. At similar reaction conditions (nucleophilic substitution) various ether, thioether or amine derivatives may be prepared.<br>
The formylation of the compounds of the formula I by processes such as e.g. Vilsmeier acylation or reaction of n-BuLi and Af,A'-dimethylformamide is a further general example of a transformation. The reaction conditions of these processes are well-known in the literature.<br>
By hydrolysis of the compounds of the formula I having nitrile, amide or ester groups, there  may  be  prepared  compounds  with  a  carboxyl  group,  which  are  suitable<br><br>
intermediates for the preparation of other compounds with novel functional groups such as e.g. esters, amides, halides, anhydrides, alcohols or amines.<br>
Oxidation or reduction reactions are a further possibility of the change of substituents in the compounds of the formula I. The most frequently used oxidation agents are peroxides (hydrogen peroxide, m-chloroperbenzoic acid or benzoyl peroxide) or permanganate, chromate or perchlorate ions. Thus e.g. by the oxidation of an alcohol group by pyridinyl dichromate or pyridinyl chtorochromate, an aldehyde group is formed, which group may be converted to a carboxyl group by further oxidation. By oxidation of the compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 has the meaning of alkyl, with lead tetraacetate in acetic acid or with A'-bromosuccinimide using a catalytic amount of benzoyl peroxide, a corresponding carbonyl derivative is obtained.<br>
By a selective oxidation of alkylthio group, alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl groups may be prepared.<br>
By the reduction of the compounds with a nitro group, the preparation of amino compounds is made possible. The reaction is carried out under usual conditions of catalytic hydrogenation or electrochemically. By catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon, alkenyl substituents may be converted to alkyl ones or the nitrilc group can be converted to aminoalkyl.<br>
Various substituents of the aromatic structure in the compounds of the formula I may be introduced by standard substitution reactions or by usual changes of individual functional groups. Examples of such reactions are aromatic substitutions, alkyiations, halogenation, hydroxylation as well as oxidation or reduction of substituents. Reagents and reaction conditions are known from the literature. Thus e.g. by aromatic substitution a nitro group is introduced in the presence of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid. By using acyl halides or alkyl halides, the introduction of an acyl group or an alkyl group is made possible. The reaction is carried out in the presence of<br><br>
Lewis acids such as aluminum- or iron-trichloride in conditions of Frie del -Crafts reaction. By the reduction of the nitro group, an amino group is obtained, which is by a diazotizing reaction converted to a suitable starting group, which may be replaced with one of the following groups: H, CN, OH, Hal.<br>
In order to prevent undesired interaction in chemical reactions, it is often necessary to protect certain groups such as e.g. hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy. For this purpose a great number of protecting groups may be used [Green TW, Wuts PGH, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1999] and the choice, use and elimination thereof are conventional methods in chemical synthesis.<br>
A convenient protection for amino or alkylamino groups are groups such as e.g. alkanoyl (acetyl), alkoxycarbonyl (methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl); arylmethoxycarbonyl (benzyloxycarbonyl), aroyl (benzoyl) or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl or trimethylsilylethoxymethyl) groups. The conditions of removing a protecting group depend upon the choice and the characteristics of this group. Thus e.g. acyl groups such as alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl or aroyl may be eliminated by hydrolysis in the presence of a base (sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), tert-butoxycarbonyl or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl) may be eliminated by treatment with a suitable acid (hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid), whereas arylmethoxycarbonyl group (benzyloxycarbonyl) may be eliminated by hydrogenation using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon.<br>
Salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by generally known processes such as e.g. by reacting the compounds of the formula I with a corresponding base or acid in an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture e.g. ethers (diethylethcr) or alcohols (ethanol, propanol or isopropanol).<br><br>
Another object of the present invention concerns the use of the present compounds in the therapy of inflammatory diseases and conditions, especially of all diseases and conditions induced by excessive TNF-a and IL-1 production.<br>
The inhibitors of production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, which are the object of the present invention, or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof may be used in the production of drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of any pathological condition or disease induced by excessive unregulated production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, which drugs should contain an effective dose of said inhibitors. The present invention more specifically relates to an effective dose of TNF-a inhibitor, which may be determined by usual methods.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation containing an effective non-toxic dosis of the present compounds as well as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or solvents.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical formulations may include blending, granulating, tabletting and dissolving ingredients. Chemical carriers may be solid or liquid. Solid carriers may be lactose, sucrose, talcum, gelatine, agar, pectin, magnesium stearate, fatty acids etc. Liquid carriers may be syrups, oils such as olive oil, sunflower oil or soya bean oil, water etc. Similarly, the carrier may also contain a component for a sustained release of the active component such as e.g. glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate. Various forms of pharmaceutical formulations may be used. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, these forms may be tablets, hard gelatine capsules, powder or granules that may be administered in capsules per os. The amount of the solid carrier may vary, but it is mainly from 25 mg to 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the formulation would be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatine capsules, sterile injectable liquids such as ampoules or non-aqueous liquid suspensions.<br><br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be applied per os, parenterally, locally, intranasally, intrarectally and intravaginally. The parenteral route herein means intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous applications. Appropriate formulations of the present compounds may be used in the prophylaxis as well as in the treatment of inflammatory diseases induced by an excessive unregulated production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, primarily TNF-a. They comprise e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic pathological conditions and diseases, eczemas, psoriasis and other inflammatory skin conditions, inflammatory eye diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and asthma.<br>
The inhibitory action of the present compounds upon TNF-a and 1L-1 production was determined by the following in vitro and in vivo experiments:<br>
Determination of TNF-a and IL-1 secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from heparinized whole blood after separating PBMC on Ficoll-Paque™Plus (Amersham-Pharmacia). To determine the TNF-a level, 3.5-5xl04 cells were cultivated in a total volume of 200 pi for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which there were added 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) previously inactivated at 54°C/30 min, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin and 20 mM HEPES (G1BCO). The cells were incubated at 3TC in an atmosphere with 5% C02 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in the medium (NC), whereas in a positive control TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 1 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coli serotype 0111:B4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of the tested substances upon TNF-a secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated by LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure according to the suggestions of the producer (R&amp;D Systems). Tlie test sensitivity was<br><br>
% inhibition = [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] * 100.<br>
The IC5o value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br>
Compounds showing IC50 with 20 pM or lower concentrations are active.<br>
Determination of TNF-a and IL-1 secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages in<br>
vitro<br>
In order to obtain peritoneal macrophages, Balb/C mouse strain males, age 8 to 12 weeks, were injected i.p. with 300 pg of zymosan (SIGMA) dissolved in a phosphate buffer (PBS) in a total volume of 0.1 ml/mouse. After 24 hours the mice were euthanized according to the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. The peritoneal cavity was washed with a sterile physiological solution (5 ml). The obtained peritoneal macrophages were washed twice with a sterile physiological solution and, after the last centrifugation (350 g/10 min), resuspended in RPMI 1640, into which 10% of FBS were added. In order to determine TNF-a secretion, 5xl04 cells/well were cultivated in a total volume of 200 pi for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) inactivated by heat, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 50 pM 2-mercaptocthanol (all of GIBCO) were added. The cells were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in a medium (NC),<br><br>
whereas in a positive control the TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 10 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coli serotype 0111 :B4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of the substances upon the TNF-a secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated with LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the ceil supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure specific for TNF-a or IL-1 (R&amp;D Systems, Biosource). The percentage of inhibition of TNF-a or IL-1 production was calculated by the equation:<br>
% inhibition = [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] * 100.<br>
The IC50 value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br>
Compounds showing IC5(, 10 uM or less are active.<br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced excessive TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice<br>
TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice was induced according to the already disclosed method (Badger AM et al., J. Pharmac. Env. Therap., 1996, 279.1453-1461). Balb/C males, age 8 to 12 weeks, in groups of 6 to 10 animals were used. The animals were treated p.o. either with a solvent only (in negative and in positive controls) or with solutions of substances 30 minutes prior to i.p. treatment with LPS (E. coli serotype 011LB4, Sigma) in a dosis of 1-25 u.g/animal. Two hours later the animals were euthanized by means of i.p. Roumpun (Bayer) and Ketanest (Parke-Davis) injection. A blood sample of each animal was taken into a Vacutainer tube (Becton Dickinson) and the plasma was separated according to the producer's instructions. The TNF-a level in the plasma was determined by ELISA procedure (Biosource, R&amp;D Systems) according to the producer's instructions. The test sensitivity was 
 <br>
IL-1 level was determined by ELISA procedure (R&amp;D Systems). The percentage of inhibition of TNF-a or IL-1 production was calculated by the equation:<br>
% inhibition = [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] * 100.<br>
Active are the compounds showing 30% or more inhibition of TNF-a production at a dosis of 10 mg/kg.<br>
Writhing assay for analgetic activity<br>
In this assay pain is induced by the injection of an irritant, most frequently acetic acid, into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Animals react with characteristic writhings, which has given the name of the assay (Collier HOJ et al., Pharmac. Chemother., 1968, 32:295-310; Fukawa K et al., J. Pharmacol Meth ., 1980, 4:251-259; Schweizer A et al., Agents Actions, 1988, 23:29-31). The assay is convenient for the determination of analgetic activity of compounds. Procedure: male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weeks, were used. A control group received methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of acetic acid in a concentration of 0.6%, whereas test groups received standard (acetylsalicylic acid) or test substances in methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of 0.6% acetic acid (volume 0.1 ml/10 g). The mice were placed individually under glass funnels and the number of writhings was registered for 20 minutes for each animal. The percentage of writhing inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>
% inhibition - (mean value of number of writhings in the control group - number of writhings in the test group)/number of writhings in the control group * 100.<br>
Active are the compounds showing such analgetic activity as acetylsalicylic acid or better.<br><br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced shock in mice<br>
Male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weks, were used. LPS isolated from Serratie marcessans (Sigma, L-6136) was diluted in sterile physiological solution. The first LPS injection was administered intradermally in a dosis of 4 ug/mouse. 18 to 24 hours later, LPS was administered i.v. in a dosis of 90-200 (ig/mouse. A control group received two LPS injections as disclosed above. The test groups received substances p.o. half an hour prior to each LPS application. Survival after 24 hours was observed.<br>
Active are the substances at which the survival at a dosis of 30 mg/kg was 40% or more.<br>
Compounds from Examples (19 and 20) show activity in at least two investigated assays though these results only represent an illustration of the biological activity of the compounds and should not limit the invention in any way.<br>
