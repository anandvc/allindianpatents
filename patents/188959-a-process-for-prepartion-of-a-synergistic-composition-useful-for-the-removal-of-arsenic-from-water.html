				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a composition useful for the removal of arsenic from water and capsules/tablets made from the said composition. Arsenic is a commonly occurring toxic metal in natural ecosystem. It may originate from geochemical reactions, industrial wastes or arsenical pesticides. When its concentration gets increased (&gt;0.05 ppm) in ground water which ultimately is used for drinking purposes, it results in the incidence of many diseases caused by arsenic poisoning amongst the people, drinking such water. Incidence of arsenic contamination in ground water and consequent sufferings of the people from chronic arsenic toxicity are reported from different parts of the globe. But the problem reported from the seven districts of West Bengal, India, surpasses all other reported cases as more than 1,75,000 villagers are showing advanced manifestations of arsenic toxicity. Thus the development of a cost effective treatment method for the removal of arsenic from drinking water becomes an imperative. The concerted efforts of the Geo-scientists, Engineers, Planners and Administrators of both state and central organisations, universities and research institutes and NGO's have already made some progress in mitigating the problem of arsenic menace in the state of West Bengal by harnessing surface water, completely circumventing the use of ground water. But, this may not be such a feasible method, more so in far flung villages where people will have to ultimately tap the ground water sources. So, it is of paramount importance that a simple, efficient and economically viable treatment technique should be developed   for   treating   the   drinking  water   in   a   domestic   scale.<br>
Most     research  has   been   directed   at   the   control     of     arsenic pollution  of  potable  water   (Prasad,   Gur   (1994);   Removal   of     Arsenic      (v)    from  aqueous   system  by  adsorption  onto     some     geological materials.   Arsenic   in  Environment,   Part   I,   J.O.   Nriagu(Ed.),   John Wiley     &amp;  sons,    Inc.).   A  variety  of   methods  have  been  used  in     the past     for     the   arsenic   removal   from  water     and     wastewater     which include   ion-exchange,   complexation  with  ferric   iron  and  coprecip-itation  with  metal  hydroxide  plus   adsorption  onto  coagulant   flock or  onto   other   adsorbents.   However,   most   of   these   methods   describe the     removal     of   a   single   species  of   arsenic   separately     and     are also  not  very  cost   effective.   Use  of   lime  water  softening  process yielded   85%   removal    (Magnusen,   L.M.,   Wough,   T.C.,   Galle,   O.K.   and Bredfeldt,      J.      (1970);   Arsenic   in  detergents,      Science).      Simple filtration  through  a  charcoal  bed  yielded  70%   removal      (Magnusen, L.M.,   Wough,   T.C.,   Galle,   O.K.   and   Bredfeldt,   J.    (1970);      Arsenic in  detergents,   Science   ;   Patterson,   J.W.   and  Minar,   R.A.       (1973); Waste   water   Technology,    2nd  Edn.,    Illinois   Inst,    for     Environment Quality     Document).      Lee   and  Rosehart    (Rosehart,   R.   and     Lee,      J. (1972);      Effective     methods   for  Arsenic   Removal     from     Gold     Mine Waste,   Can  mining  J.)   have  reported  40%   reduction  of   arsenite     by activated  carbon.    Ion   -   exchange   resins   also   appear   effective     in removing     arsenate     and  arsenite   but   these   are     too     costly.      The treatment     process   development   for  arsenic   removal   making  use     of activated  carbon   (Huang,   C.P.   and  Fu,    P.L.K.    (1982);   Treatment   of Arsenic      (v)    containing  water  by  activated   carbon     process.      55th Annual     Conf.,      W.P.C.F.,   St.   Louis   Missour)    takes   care     of     only As(V).   Similarly,   attempts   to   remove   arsenic   from  aqueous     system<br>
by     adsorption     onto  hematite   and   feldspar   (Prasad,      Gur      (1994); Removal     of     Arsenic   (v)    from  aqueous   system  by     adsorption     onto some     geological   materials.   Arsenic   in  Environment,   Part   I,      J.O. Nriagu(Ed.),      John     Wiley   &amp;   sons,    Inc.)   were      fruitful     only     for As(V).      Removal   of   arsenic    (pentavalent)    from  drinking  water     was achieved  by  the   activated  alumina   system,   treating  the   raw     water at     pH     5.5    (Hathaway,   S.W.   and     Rubel,      F.(Jr.)(1988);      Removing Arsenic   From  Drinking  Water.   Journal   of  A.W.W.A.),   not   at     drinking  water  pH   (pH   6.5   -   8.5).   Adsorption  of   arsenic    (both     As(III) and  As(V)   onto  clay  minerals,   kiolinite   and  montmorillonite,      has been     studied     by     some  workers    (Frost,   R.R.      and     Griffin,      R.A. (1977) ,-Effect     of     pH  on  adsorption  of  Arsenic     &amp;     Selenium     From landfill     leachate  by  clay  minerals.   Soil   Sci.   Am.   J.).   But     this study  has   been  done   for   leachate  of   these   species  by  the  minerals and     not   for  the   removal   of   arsenic   from  water.    In  all   the     above described  methods,   dependent   on  adsorption  theory,   a   large   amount of   adsorbent   is   needed  which   is   possible   only   in   laboratory   scale and   is   inconvenient   for  commercial   use  due   to  production  of     huge quantity  of   sludge.<br>
Major treatment methods for arsenic removal employing precipitation technique include sulfide precipitation with addition of sodium or hydrogen sulfide (Curry, N.A. (1972);Philosophy &amp; Methodology of Metallic Waste Treatment. 27th Purdue Industrial Waste Conf., Purdue University) which is partially effective for arsenate, but ineffective for arsenite (Rosehart, R. and Lee, J. (1972);      Effective     methods   for  Arsenic   Removal      from     Gold     Mine<br>
Waste,   Can  mining  J.).   Other  precipitating  agents  have   also     been used     for     arsenic  removal   such  as,   lime  which  is     effective     for both,      arsenite     and  arsenate   (Rosehart,   R.   and  Lee,      J.       (1972); Effective     methods   for  Arsenic  Removal   from  Gold  Mine  Waste,      Can mining  J.)    but   at   a   higher  pH    (   &gt;   11.0   )    and   it   is   effective   only in     the     presence   of   iron    (Skripach,      T.,Kagan,v.,      Ramanov,      ML, Kamer,   L.   and  Semina,   A.    (1971);   Removal   of   Fluorine   and     Arsenic from     the  Waste  Water  of   rare   earth   Industry.   5th     Internat.Conf. Water     Poll.   Res.).   Alum  could  be  used   for  arsenic      (pentavalent) removal   but   is   less   effective   giving   only   10-25   %   removal       (Logs-don,      G.S.,   Sorg,   T.J.   and  Symons,   J.M.    (1974);Removal     of     heavy metals     by     Conventional     Treatment.   16th     Water     Quality     Conf., University     of      Illinois   Urbana,    Illinois.)    and     doses     are     also high.      When  polyvalent   metallic   ions   are   introduced   in  the     water samples,   they  react   with  the   complex  arsenic   ions   and  are     copre-cipitated  at   the  pH  of   their  hydroxide  deposits   (Patterson,      J.W. and     Minar,   R.A.    (1973);   Waste  water  Technology,   2nd  Edn.,      Illinois   Inst,    for  Environment   Quality  Document.).   Thus   ferric     chloride  has  been  used  for  precipitation   (Shen,   Y.S.    (1973);   Study  of Arsenic   Removal   from  Drinking  Water.   J.   of   A.W.W.A.)    giving     good results  with  As(V)    in  the   absence   of   any  oxidising  agent.      Recent workers      (Pande,   S.P.,   Deshpande,   L.S.,   Patni,   P.M.      and     Lutade, S.L.       (1997);      Arsenic  Removal   Studies   on  Some  Ground     Waters     of West     Bengal,    India.   J.   Environ.   Sci.   Hlth.)   have     used     chlorine for   oxidation   followed  by  coagulation   using   ferric   chloride.   This method     apart      from  being   clumsy,    is   a   two   step  process     and     the suggested     dose   is   also   high.    Ferric   sulfate   along  with   alum     has<br>
also  been  used  as   coagulant   and  has  given  good  results      (Logsdon, G.S.,    Sorg,   T.J.   and  Syraons,   J.M.    (1974)/Removal   of   heavy     metals by     Conventional   Treatment.    16th  Water  Quality  Conf.,      University of      Illinois     Urbana,      Illinois.)   but   it   is      successful     only     in removing  As(V).    Ferrous   sulfate   can   also  precipitate   arsenic     but then     again     it   can  only  remove     pentavalent     arsenic      (Shabumin, I.I.,   Gutman,   A.I.   and  Kogan,   B.L.    (1968);   Removing  Arsenic     from sewage     of  Gold  extraction  Plants.   Tsventnye  Metally.;      Rosehart, R.   and  Lee,    J.    (1972);   Effective   methods   for  Arsenic   Removal   from Gold  Mine  Waste,   Can  mining  J.).   Similar   is   the   case  with   ferrous and   ferric   hydroxide  precipitation   (Viniegra,   G.,   Marquez,      R.E., Espinosa,      M.B.      and     Caballero,    P.J.    (1964);      Treatment     of      the Drinking    Water.Salud.   Publ.   Mex.    ;   Gulledge,   J.H.   and  0     Connor, T.J.      (1973);   Removal   of  Arsenic   (v)   from  water  by  Adsorption     on Alumina     and  Ferric   hydroxide.   J.   A.W.W.A.).   Thus,    in     all     these methods,      described     above,   chemicals   were     used     separately     for adsorption  or  precipitation  of   either  arsenite   or  arsenate   and   if used     for  both   species,    they  have   not   given  good   results   or     have huge     sludge  yield  or  need  high  doses.   While   the     composition     of present   invention  can   initiate  different   actions   like     oxidation, complexation,   coprecipitation  and  adsorption   followed  by  decolou-risation   simultaneously  at   pH   levels   specified   for  drinking  water<br>
(pH     6.5   -   8.5),   overcoming   the   previous   shortcomings.   So,      also,<br>
above   99%   removal   of   arsenic   is   achieved.<br>
The     main     object   of   the   present   invention   is   to     provide     a composition  useful   for   the   removal   of   arsenic   from  water.   Another<br>
Object      is      to     provide      capsule/tablets     made      from     the      said composition    .Yet   another   object   of   the   present   invention   is   to provide   a   composition  useful   for   removal   of   arsenic,   both  As(III) and   As(V),      from   water   which   can   be   easily   adopted   in   ordinary households.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of a synergistic composition composition useful for removal of arsenic from water which comprises conventional mixing of complexing and coprecipitating agent (ferrous sulphate) 73% to 87%,oxidising agent (potassium permanganate) 9% to 18% and adsorbing  agent   (   activated  charcoal)   4%  to  10%   .<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the complexing and co precipitating agent used is ferrous sulphate. In another embodiment oxidizing agent used is potassium permanganate.In yet another embodiment the adsorbing and de colourising agent used is activated  charcoal.<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides a capsule/tablet made  from  the  above  composition  by  conventional  methods.<br>
The composition prepared is not a mere admixture resulting in mere aggregation of the properties of individual ingredients but is  a  synergistic  mixture.<br>
It is a small capsule, containing about 0.6 g of simple chemicals<br>
like   ferrous   sulphate     (FeSO  4.   7H20),        potassium	permanga<br>
nate (KMn04) and activated charcoal in the ratio of 7.5:1.5:1 to 20:2:1 (+O.05) . The composition achieves the removal of arsenic by a process of oxidation, complexation, co-precipitation and adsorption followed by decolourisation simultaneously. The resulting precipitate can be removed by filtration (using clean cotton wool or a fine cloth or water filter candle). Here, one component of the composition i.e., potassium permanganate oxidises ferrous to ferric and arsenite to arsenate and then, arsenic forms a complex with iron and gets coprecipitated with its hydroxide. Thus, KMn04 acts as an oxidising agent as well as a disinfectant and activated charcoal acts as an adsorbent and decolourising material. In short, ferrous sulphate and potassium permanganate collectively precipitate arsenic and activated charcoal works as a good adsorbent. Hence, the efficiency of arsenic   removal   is   enhanced.<br>
The process is as follows, the contents of one capsule is added to about 10 litres of water containing upto about 0.3 ppm of arsenic and after stirring well with wooden or glass rod it is allowed to stand for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Then, the water is filtered through clean cotton wool or a fine piece of cloth. Arsenic concentration in the filtered water falls below 0.005 ppm. This result has been found at normal conditions of pH and temperature of water. This composition must prove to be a boon to the villagers threatened with arsenic poisoning owing to its simplicity and low cost. Even the very poor can afford it. Care has to be taken in storing the capsules in airtight containers to prevent them from coming into contact with atmospheric moisture. Following examples are given by way of illustration therefore it should not for construed to the limit of the scope of present invention.<br><br>
Example    :    1<br>
0.6g of said composition, FeS04.7H20, KMn04 and activeted charcoal in the ratio of 87% : 9% : 4% was added in 10 litres of water containing 0.3ppm arsenic, stirred well and filtered after one hour. In the filtrate the concentration of aresenic was estimated and was found 0.037ppm which is below permissible limit.   The   removal   was   87%.<br>
Example 2 0.6g of said composition, FeS04.7H20, KMn04 and activeted charcoal in the ratio of 75% : 15% : 10% was added in 10 litres of water containing 0.3ppm arsenic, stirred well and filtered after one hour. In the filtrate, the concentration of aresenic was estimated and was found 0.006ppm which is below permissible limit.   The   removal   was   98%.<br>
Example        3<br>
0.6g of said composition, FeS04.7H20, KMn04 and activeted charcoal in the ratio of 73% : 18% : 9% was added in 10 litres of water containing 0.3ppm arsenic, stirred well and filtered after one hour. In the filtrate the concentration of aresenic could not be detected upto 0.005ppm which is below permissible limit. The removal   was  more   than   99%.<br>
The  main  advantages  of   the  present   invention<br>
(1)	The Composition of the present invention can be used for the removal of both species i.e. arsenite and arsenate from water<br>
(2)	The   composition  acts   as   a  disinfectant.<br>
(3)      The   composition  acts   as   a  decolourising  mixture. (4)      The   composition   is   very  easy   to  use.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
