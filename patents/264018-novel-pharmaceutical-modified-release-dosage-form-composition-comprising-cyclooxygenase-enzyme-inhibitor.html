				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical modified release dosage form comprising at least one cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvates, hydrates, or derivatives thereof as active agent, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for controlling the release of the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor. Further, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention provides for the administration of a therapeutically and/or prophylactically effective amount of the active agent. Furthermore, the dosage form preferably provides a release of not more than about 60% of the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor in 1 hour and not less than about 75% of the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor after 12 hours when tested in accordance with the dissolution method (I) described herein employing Distilled water with 2.0% Sodium lauryl sulphate as the dissolution medium or in accordance with the dissolution method (II) described herein employing pH 7.0 Phosphate buffer with 2.0% Sodium lauryl sulphate as the dissolution medium or in accordance with the dissolution method (III) described herein employing 0.001 N Hydrochloric acid with 1.0% Sodium lauryl sulphate as dissolution medium. Still further, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention when tested in a group of healthy humans preferably achieves a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after at least about 1 hour of administration of the dosage form,. The present invention also provides process of preparing such dosage form compositions and prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods of using such dosage form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is an enzyme which is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including sites of inflammation and the stomach. The COX-1 enzyme of the stomach produces certain chemical messengers (called prostaglandins) that ensure the natural mucus lining which protects the inner stomach. Common anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin block the function of the COX-1 enzyme along with another enzyme, COX-2 (see below). When COX-1 enzyme is blocked, inflammation is reduced, but the protective mucus lining of the stomach is also reduced, that can cause stomach upset, ulceration, and bleeding from stomach and intestines. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are newly developed drugs for inflammation that selectively block the COX-2 enzyme. Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of the chemical messengers (prostaglandins) that cause the pain and swelling of arthritis inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors are a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because they selectively block the COX-2 enzyme and not the COX-1 enzyme, these drugs are uniquely different from traditional NSAIDs. This selective action provides the benefits of reducing inflammation without irritating the stomach. These<br>
drugs pose an advantage in comparison to previous anti- inflammatory drugs because their mechanism of action carries nowhere near the risk of stomach ulceration and bleeding. The COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, valdecoxib, itacoxib, deracoxib and the like. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed medications for the inflammation of arthritis and other body tissues, such as in tendinitis and bursitis. Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, indomethacin, nimesulide, ketorolac, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, nabumetone, and the like. Nimesulide is a potent NSAID, presently used in the treatment of painful inflammatory conditions, due to rheumatoid arthritis, which also possesses antipyretic activity. Compared to other NSAIDs, nimesulide has a better therapeutic ratio, low gastrotoxicity and generally good tolerability. Nimesulide is a strongly hydrophobic substance that is practically insoluble in water (solubility in water at room temperature being 0.01mg/ml).<br>
Drug levels can be maintained above the lower level of the therapeutic plasma concentration for longer periods of time by administering larger doses of conventionally formulated dosage forms, but this approach might produce toxic effects due to high plasma concentration of the drug. Alternatively, another approach is to administer a drug at certain intervals of time, resulting in oscillating drug levels, the so-called peak and valley effect. This approach is generally associated with several potential problems, such as a large peak (toxic effect) and valley (non-active drug level) effect, and a lack of patient compliance leading to drug therapy inefficiency or failure. To overcome such issues, modified release compositions can be formulated with the objective of either releasing the drug in a sustained or controlled manner for an extended period of time or releasing a portion of the drug immediately followed by a sustained or controlled release of the drug. PCT publication bearing no. WO 95/14460 describes such compositions which initially release a burst of a therapeutic agent and then release the agent at an essentially constant rate for extended time period. Patients suffering from pain and/or inflammatory conditions primarily require high daily dosages of NSAIDs. In order to administer such high doses of NSAID only once a day, the release from the dosage form must be safe, predictable and reliable. Also the dosage form should be designed such that there is no sudden undesirable rise in plasma concentrations due to dose dumping. Moreover, the rate and extent of release and also the release pattern of the drug from the composition during in-vitro evaluation should correlate substantially to in-vivo performance of the composition.<br>
US patent no. 6,713,089 describes a quick release pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising a therapeutically and/or prophylactically active substance such as nimesulide and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, said active substance being<br>
defined by one of features such as when tested in accordance with the dissolution method USP XXIII Apparatus 2 employing 0.07 N hydrochloric acid as dissolution medium, at least 50% w/w of the active substance is dissolved within the first 20 minutes of the test. US patent no. 6,638,535 pertains to a pharmaceutical pellet comprising a substantially homogenous mixture of a rapidly-acting hypnotic agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pellet forming carrier of microcrystalline cellulose, wherein the amount of said hypnotic agent and said pellet forming carrier is at least 90% of the pellet weight, said pellet having a particle size within the range of 0.85 to 2.0 mm and wherein said pellet exhibits a dissolution profile under U.S. Pharmacopoeia XXIII, Apparatus I, in a basket apparatus at 37°C, in 0.01N HC1 medium and at 100 r.p.m., such that at 5 minutes from the start of the test, less than 60% of the hypnotic agent has been released from the pellet.<br>
Another US patent no. 6,599,529 discloses an oral pharmaceutical modified release multiple-units composition in unit dosage form for administration of a therapeutically and/or prophylactically effective amount of a NSAID, said unit dosage form comprising at least two NSAID-containing fractions; a first NSAID-containing fraction of multiple-units for quick release of the NSAID, wherein said fraction comprises an antacid or an alkaline agent and wherein the quick in-vitro release is such that, when subjecting the first NSAID-containing fraction to dissolution in USP XXIII  Apparatus 2, dissolution medium 900.0 ml, at 50 rpm. employing 0.07 N HC1 as dissolution medium, at least 50% w/w of the NSAID is released within the first 20 min of the test; and a second NSAID-containing fraction of multiple-units in the form of coated delayed release multiple units for extended release of the NSAID, said units coated with a coating substantially water-insoluble, but water-diffusible and substantially pH-independent, wherein said second NSAID-containing fraction of multiple-units releases from about 6% to 30% of said NSAID within 0.5 hours upon dissolution testing by USP XXIII  Apparatus 2, dissolution medium comprising 750 ml of 0.1 N HC1 for 1 hour followed by 250 ml of dissolution medium comprising trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide in distilled water at 50 r.p.m., and wherein the release of said second NSAID-containing fraction is independent of the release of said first NSAID-containing fraction.<br>
US patent no. 6,086,920 describes disintegratable microspheres giving 100% aqueous dissolution in less than 30 minutes made from a composition comprising about 50% to about 90% of at least one bio-affecting agent such as nimesulide; about 2% to about 40% of at least one disintegrant; and about 5% to about 15% by weight of at least one spheronization aid. US publication no.<br>
20050020613 pertains to a sustained-release oral dosage form comprising a subunit, wherein the subunit comprises an opioid analgesic and a sustained-release material, wherein the dissolution rate in-vitro of the subunit, when measured by standard USP Drug Release test of U.S. Pharmacopeia (2003) , is less than about 10% within about 6 hours and at least about 60% within about 24 hours; less than about 10% within about 8 hours and at least about 60% within about 24 hours; less than about 10% within about 10 hours and at least about 60% within about 24 hours; or less than about 10% within about 12 hours and at least about 60% within about 24 hours; the dosage form providing a duration of therapeutic effect of about 24 hours. US publication no. 20030170303 describes an orally deliverable pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory drug of low water solubility and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable polymers, wherein the composition provides an in vitro sustained-release dissolution profile following placement in a standard dissolution medium exhibiting release of about 5% to about 35% of the drug 2 hours after said placement; release of about 10% to about 85% of the drug 8 hours after said placement; and release of about 30% to about 90% of the drug 18 hours after said placement.<br>
However, still there exists a need to develop oral modified release pharmaceutical compositions comprising NSAID for prophylactic and/or therapeutic use, which can release the drug in a desired manner so as to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug in the plasma for extended period of time but without causing drug related toxicity, and which can be prepared in an easy and cost-effective manner.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have done extensive research and conducted several experiments to alleviate the drawbacks existing in prior art to develop a dosage form by using different excipients and formulation methods for modifying the release rate of a cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor preferably a NSAID so as to obtain the desired in vitro and/or in vivo release characteristics for providing release of the active agent for an extended duration of time devoid of any substantial toxicity, thus demonstrating a significant advancement over the prior art.<br>

In-Vivo study method<br>
A comparative bio-availability (in vivo) study of nimesulide formulations of the present invention was carried out against Aulin® tablets (CSC PHARMACEUTICALS HANDELS GmbH) in a group of healthy humans. The aim of the study was to conduct comparative pharmacokinetic evaluation of modified release formulations containing 200 mg (referred to as 'T-l') of Nimesulide. The Nimesulide modified release tablets (Test composition i.e. 'T-l' as in example-1) was evaluated against Nimesulide conventional release tablet (Aulin® 2x100 mg immediate release tablets referred to as 'REFERENCE' i.e. R-l taken at 0 hours) in healthy human volunteers, before and after food, using a, randomized, open-label , balanced, two-treatment, two period, two-sequence, multiple-dose, cross over design and relative bioavailability study. The study design involved twelve healthy human volunteers aged between 22-31 years, weighing 70.1±8 kgs with a mean BMI (Body Mass Index) of 16.9±1.9. Two studies namely fed &amp; fasted studies were conducted by giving the formulations after heavy breakfast and fasting conditions respectively. Volunteers were abstained from caffeine intake for 24 hours before the study and during the period of study. Two study periods were used for the experiment. The dosing was conducted for 7 days in each period. One Tablet of Test product at "0" hour on each day or two tablets of Reference product at "0" hour on each day was orally administered with 240-ml of water after consuming the whole standard high fat non-vegetarian breakfast within 30 minutes. Drug analysis was done by collecting blood samples in vials through indwelling cannula/clean vein puncture throughout the study at predose with a blood sample (1x5 ml) within 1 hour prior to dosing on each day upto 7 days. The post dose samples (1x5 ml) were collected at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 12.5, 13.0, 13.5, 14.0, 14.5, 15.0, 16.0, 18.0, 20.0 and 24.0 hours after the administration of nimesulide tablet. The blood samples were collected in sample collection tubes containing Sodium EDTA as the anticoagulant. The plasma obtained was separated from blood by centrifugation and the samples were analyzed using HPLC for the concentration of Nimesulide. The various pharmacokinetic parameters (pK) were evaluated namely Cmax(peak plasma concentration of the drug), Tmax (time to reach peak plasma<br>
concentration), AUC 0-t (area under the 'plasma concentration versus time' curve from time=0 to time=t where't' denotes the time of last measurable concentration), AUC 0-∞ (area under the 'plasma concentration versus time' curve from t=0 to time=∞, where '∞' denotes infinity) and ti/2 (plasma elimination half life). The statistical and pharmacokinetic analyses were generated using WinNonlin® software (version 5.0). The statistical and pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table-1 (for fed study) and Table-2 (for fasted study) below.<br>
Table   1:   Comparative   pharmacokinetic  parameters	of 'REFERENCE'   (R-l)  and  TEST<br>
composition (T-l) in the fed state:<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Table 2:  Comparative	pharmacokinetic  parameters	of 'REFERENCE'   (R-l)  and  TEST<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The study showed that the TEST product (T-l) i.e. the Nimesulide Modified release composition of the present invention achieved a delayed Tmax compared to the REFERENCE product which is a 'immediate release' composition in both the fasted and fed state studies. However, the Cmax and AUC values obtained for the TEST product in both the studies indicated that the composition of the present invention produced desired plasma concentration of nimesulide for extended period of time. All the pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated in the study showed an increase in the fed state study in comparison to the fasted state study for the TEST as well as REFERENCE product indicating that presence of food in stomach might increase the plasma concentration of nimesulide in both the Modified release (MR) and Immediate release (IR) formulations. The examples of pharmaceutical compositions given below serve to illustrate embodiments of<br>
the present invention. However, they do not intend to limit the scope of present invention.<br>
