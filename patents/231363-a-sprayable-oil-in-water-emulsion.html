				<td>High Lipid Content Sprayable Emulsions<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to sprayable cil-in-water emulsions with a high content of oil<br>
phase.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Sprays are attractive as a vehicle to apply liquid formulations on the skin such as in<br>
skin care and cosmetic applications. Sprays are convenient to use and typically allow a<br>
more controlled and even application of the formulation to the skin. Formulations for<br>
use on the skin often are emulsion based, usually in the form of oil-in-water (O/W)<br>
emulsions, allowing the presence of both lipophilic and hydrophilic components in one<br>
formulation. In a number of instances an emulsion-based formulation requires a<br>
relatively high amount of lipophilic components. This for example is the case where<br>
the formulation needs to have high amounts of lipophilic actives, which in turn require<br>
the presence of relatively high amounts of liquid oily components that are needed to<br>
build a liquid oil phase. However, emulsions with high lipid phase content need<br>
relatively high amounts of emulsifie:. This in turn results in an increase of viscosity<br>
having the consequence that such formulations cannot be sprayed.<br>
Also sunscreen formulations are frecuently formulated as oil-in-water emulsions.<br>
Sunscreen formulations having a high SPF (Sun Protection Factor) are nowadays more<br>
and more wanted by consumers because of increased awareness of skin damage and of<br>
the long term effects of exposure of the skin to sunlight. Sunscreen formulations with<br>
SPF values as high as SPF 50 and even higher are recommended for use on sensitive<br>
skin types and for children. Such high SPF sunscreen formulations require the presence<br>
of large amounts of UV filters. The largest choice of UV filters is amongst the<br>
lipophilic filters, which also are the most effective and therefore are widely used in<br><br>
sunscreen formulations. The choice of hydrophilic UV filters is limited and so is their<br>
effectiveness so that increasing the amount of this type of filters is not sufficient to<br>
reach high SPF value and moreover usually gives rise to white staining upon usage.<br>
Inorganic pigments are another type of filters, the amounts of which could also be<br>
increased, but this leads to problems of stability of the formulations and again of white<br>
staining. Consequently sunscreen formulations with high SPF values can only be<br>
obtained by adding larger amounts of lipophilic filters. This poses a special challenge<br>
to sprayable formulations since increasing the; amount of lipophilic components in the<br>
formulations requires more emulsifier, resulting in increased viscosity.<br>
WO-03/013455 relates to light protecting cosmetic or dermatological emulsions, which<br>
contain: (a) at least one benzotriazole derivative and (b) at least one grade of latex<br>
particles having a mean particle size of 100 to 400 nm.<br>
EP-A-1 206 933 relates to compositions containing caprylyl glycol or an analogue<br>
thereof, and a preservative agent. It further relates to the use of caprylyl glycol or an<br>
analogue thereof to increase the activity of preservative agents. EP-A-1 238 651<br>
additionally relates to chemical compositions containing caprylyl glycol or an analogue<br>
thereof, and a particular combination of preservative agents. It further relates to the use<br>
of caprylyl glycol or an analog thereof to increase the activity of preservative agents,<br>
more in particular of a combinatior of iodopropynyl butyl carbamate and<br>
phenoxyethanol.<br>
EP-A-1 005 851 discloses cosmetic or dermatological compositions useful for treating<br>
Malassezia spp. infections, especially dandruff, comprising an alkynyl carbamate<br>
derivative and polyol.<br>
Hence there is a need to provide sprayable formulations that have a high content of<br>
lipophilic components. In particular there is a need for sprayable formulations that<br>
contain relatively high amounts of ipophilic ingredients, in particular of lipophilic<br>
active ingredients. There is a more specific need to provide sprayable sunscreen<br>
formulations that have a high SPF value. Providing such formulations is an object of<br>
this invention.<br><br>

The emulsions according to the inver tion can also be used in sunscreen applications<br>
and in that instance take the form of sunscreen sprays. In these products, the lipid<br>
and/or aqueous phase contains one of more sunscreen filters which are for example<br>
organic substances that are capable of absorbing ultraviolet radiation and to set free the<br>
absorbed energy as longer-wave radiation.<br>
UVB-filters can be oil or water-soluble. As oil-soluble substances there can be<br>

The emulsions of the invention are prepared following art-known procedures to prepare<br>
oil-in-water emulsions. In generat, the oil and the water phases are prepared separately<br>
whereupon the oil phase is added to the water phase or vice versa, upon vigorous<br>
stirring as to form the emulsion. If desired, additional components may be added to the<br>
emulsion. If desired, the emulsification process may be done at increased temperature,<br>
e.g. at a temperature above 50 °C, or above 70 °C.<br>
The sprayable emulsions of this invention may find use in instances where high lipid<br>
content is required, e.g. emulsions with relatively high amounts of active ingredients<br>
that are lipophilic, e.g. sunscreen formulations with high SPF, or sprays aimed at<br>
delivering oils.<br>
