				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns novel flavour modulating substances that may advantageously be applied in foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics. The flavour modulating substances according to the invention are capable of modulating the impact of flavour imparting substances. The present invention also provides flavour compositions that can be used to confer a fuller and richer taste and/or aroma to foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics. The present invention also encompasses the use of the aforementioned flavour modulating substances for improving the flavour of foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics, as well as to foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics containing these substances.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The flavour of foodstuffs and beverages consists of two parts: ihe aroma and the taste. In general what is perceived through the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity is referred to as 'aroma', whereas the term 'taste' is generally used to describe the sensory impact that is perceived via the mouth, especially the tongue. The sense of taste provides the final analysis of food prior to ingestion thereof. Visual and olfactory signals already give a first indication but only after intake of the food into the mouth the final decision is made either to ingest or to reject the food. Sweet taste is usually a signal that the food is safe (nice) leading to ingestion of the food. The 'reactions' to salt and umami are really dependent on the strength of the signal. Bitter and sour are usually repulsive taste sensations, leading to rejection. Temperature is another measure by which the food is judged just as well as aching sensations like capsaicin (hot pepper) and certain chemicals (like carbon dioxide).<br>
In short, this means that taste is a very crucial and very complex system. Until recently most flavour research was focused towards aroma. Especially the last years a series of publications relating to molecules with a (positive) contribution to the taste of foodstuffs has emerged.<br>
Such research has been stimulated significantly by the fact that quite some receptors which are involved in the different taste sensations have been characterized by now (B. Lindemann; Nature 413, 219 (2001)).<br><br>
Several screening systems have been described that make it possible to screen, in a short time, large series of molecules for their (modulating) effect on taste response (cf. WO04055048, GB2396414, WO0177292 and US2004/0072254).<br>
It is remarkable that most research on these taste modulating molecules so far has been devoted to taste enhancement in savoury products. Several, mainly Japanese, publications describe umami molecules, i.e. alternatives to mono sodium glutamate (MSG) (H Suzuki et al, J Agric Food Chem 50, 313-318 (2002); K Shima et al, J Agric Food Chem 46, 1465-1468 (1998); Y Ueda et al, Biosc Biotech Biochem 61 1977 (1997)).<br>
In EP 1291342, a 'general taste enhancer' is disclosed that was reported to be suitable for enhancing sweetness as well.<br>
In patent applications WO9704667 and WO04075633 tripeptides and amino acid condensates with lactic acid and succinic acid are described that have both their own taste as well as some enhancing properties. Alpha keto acids are reported to give body and mouthfeel to foodstuffs they are added to (US6287620).<br>
Chlorogenic acids are claimed to enhance sweetness and to reduce bitterness (WO02100192).<br>
in sweet and beverage products, further examples of the importance of the gustative dimension of flavourings have been reported including bitterness, tingling and cooling-freshness.<br>
Bitterness is an essential aspect of some food flavours, among which chocolate taste. Purine alkaloids, like theombromine and caffeine, as well as amino acids and peptides have been known for a long time as bitter compounds. In British patent no. GB 1420909 it is disclosed that the bitter flavour of cocoa can be reproduced using a combination of a purine alkaloid and an amino acid or an oligopeptide which 'produces a surpringly more natural simultaneously bitter and astringent flavour note than either of these types of substances alone'.<br>
Quite a bit of work has been devoted to find bitter taste suppressors (A.N.Pronin et al, Chemical Senses 29, 583-593 (2004); EP1401500; P.A. Breslin, Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology 7, 390-399 (1996)).<br>
Menthol, an important constituent of peppermint oil, has a strong impact on flavoured products not only because of its mint smell but also because it imparts a cooling, fresh taste. Next to mint flavoured products, the use of menthol in other type of flavour to impart a cool taste has been suggested. US patent application no. US<br><br>
2005/013846, for example, discloses how menthol and derivatives thereof can be used as flavouring in water continuous spreadable acidified food products to obtain table spreads exhibiting a fresh, cool taste impression.<br>
Similarly, cinnamic aldehyde and eugenol, constituents of cinnamon oil, are used in flavouring composition for confectionary products, not only for their smell but also because they impart a warm and piquant-tingling taste. The oral pungency of cinnamic aldehyde was described as burning and tingling by Cliff M and Heymann H [ Journal of Sensory Studies 7 (1992)279-290]. According to the same authors eugenol exhibits a long-lasting numbing effect. Cinnamon oil has been proposed as a taste improving flavouring. International patent application no. WO 90/06689 discloses that cinnamon oil, among other spice extracts, added to a minty flavour formulation, can be used to improve the long-lasting flavour of chewing-gum.<br>
Another interesting aspect of taste is that it can have an impact on aroma. It was reported that people having artificially sweetened water in their mouth were significantly more sensitive to the smell of benzaldehyde than people having plain water in their mouth (P. Dalton et al, Nature Neurosci. 3, 431-432 (2000)).<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide new 'flavour modulating substances' that provide a positive contribution to the overall flavour impression of foodstuffs, beverages, and/or pharmaceutics they are incorporated in.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that flavour modulating substances represented by the following formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof can be used advantageously for modulating the flavour of foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics:<br>
R1-CR2OR3-CO-NR4Y-X (i)<br>
The flavour improving substances according to the present invention can be applied advantageously to impart desirable flavour, especially taste, attributes to the aforementioned products. In addition, the present flavour improving substances are capable of modifying the taste and/or aroma impact of other flavour ingredients contained within these same products, thereby improving the overall flavour quality of these products.<br><br>
A substance according to formula (I) wherein Y represents dimethyl-substituted methylene, X represents phenyl, R1 represents C4 alkyl R2 and R4 represent hydrogen and R3 represents methyl has been described previously in US patent no. 4,274,862, which document relates to herbicidal compositions and methods for controlling weeds. US 4,274,862 does not in any way mention or refer to flavour characteristics of the substances disclosed therein.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to flavour modulating substances according to formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof, as well as to flavour compositions, foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics, comprising one or more substances according to formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof.<br>
Other aspects of the present invention relate to the use of the substances according to formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof for modulating,, especially enhancing, the flavour of foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics, and to a process for modulating the flavour of the latter products.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention in a first aspect relates to a flavour composition comprising at least 0.1 wt.% of one or more flavouring substances and between 0.001 and 80 wt.% of one or more flavour modulating substances according to formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof:<br>
R1-CR2(OR3)-CO-NR4-Y-X (i)<br>
wherein:<br>
Y represents a covalent bond, C1-C5 alkylene or C2-C5 alkenyl, each optionally substituted<br>
with 1-5 substituents selected from hydroxyl, C1-C3 alkoxyl and C1-C3 acyl;<br>
X represents phenyl, substituted with one or more substituents selected from hydroxyl and<br>
CrC3 alkoxyl, and optionally further substituted with one or more substituents selected<br>
from C1-C3 hydroxyalkyl<br>
R1 represents hydrogen; C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl or C3-C8<br>
cycloalkenyl, each optionally substituted with 1-8 substituents selected from hydroxyl,<br>
oxo, C1-C3 alkyl, C1-C3 alkoxyl, C1-C3 acyl, C2-C3 alkenyl and C1-C3 carboxyl;<br><br>
R2 represents hydrogen; C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, or C3-C8<br>
cycloalkenyi, each optionally substituted with 1-8 substituents selected from hydroxyl,<br>
C1-C3 alkyl, C2-C3 alkenyl and C1-C3 carboxyl;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen; or CrC3 acyl or CrC3 alkyl, each optionally substituted with 1-3<br>
hydroxyl groups; and<br>
R4 represents hydrogen; C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkenyl, C1-C3 acyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C3-C6<br>
cycloalkenyl or C1-C6 acyl, each optionally substituted with 1-6 substituents selected from<br>
hydroxyl, C1-C3  alkyl and C2-C3 alkenyl.<br>
The present inventors have found that the above-mentioned substances are very useful ingredients which, particularly in the presence of other flavour imparting substances, are capable of imparting highly appreciated taste sensations to the products in which they are incorporated, specifically a quite remarkable "roundness", "fullness", "substance", "fermented fish character" and/or "continuity". Because of this, the present flavour modulating substances can be employed to improve the taste (including "mouthfeel") of foodstuffs, beverages and pharmaceutics. In addition, it has been found that the flavour modulating substances according to the invention are capable of complementing and modifying the sensory impact of other, flavour imparting, substances contained in the aforementioned products.<br>
The term "flavour modulating" as used herein refers to the capability of a composition or substance to alter the taste and/or aroma impact of other, flavour imparting, substances present within the same product, with the proviso that this change in taste and/or aroma impact is not caused by a flavour contribution of said substance per se, but instead that it mainly results from the combined effect of on the one hand the flavour modulating substance and on the other hand the other flavour imparting substances. The present substances combine the capability of modifying the taste of other flavour substances and a taste contribution of their own. The favourable impact of the present flavour modulating substances is believed to be the result of the combination of these two effects. Because the flavour modulating substances according to the invention are not particularly volatile, they do not produce a strong aroma impact, even though they do affect the aroma impact of other flavour imparting substances. Here the term "aroma" refers to the aspect of flavour that is perceived through the olfactory epithelium. Because of the low volatility of the present flavour modulating substances it is believed that the advantageous properties of these substances are somehow associated with the impact that these substances have on the sensory receptors located within the mouth.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, related to flavour modulating substances according to formula (I) wherein Y represents a covalent bond or a linear C1-C5 alkylene or C2-C5 alkenyl, each optionally susbtituted with 1-5 substituents selected from hydroxyl, C1-C3 alkoxyl and C1-C3 acyl;<br>

The invention is further illustrated by means of the following examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
Lactic acid (9 g) and tyramine (3 g ) were mixed and heated for 4 hrs at 120 °C. The reaction mixture was cooled and washed with ethyl acetate. The residue (7 g) was dissolved in 25 g of water. NMR showed that at least 20 % of the reaction mixture was N-lactoyl-tyramine.<br>
Subsequently 12 g of maltodextrin (MD 10) and 6 g of salt were added and the slurry was spray-dried.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of pure N-lactoyl tyramine<br>
40g of ethyl lactate and 10 g of tyramine were reacted at 120 °C for 4 hours. The reaction product was cooled and dissolved in 200g water. The solution obtained was washed first with 200 ml of ethyl acetate and then with another 100 ml of ethyl acetate. The water phase was evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 70 °C. 7.5g of a very viscous liquid was obtained; analysis by LC-MS and NMR showed that it contained 60% of N-lactoyl tyramine.<br>
This product was then purified using preparative liquid chromatography. The separation was carried out on two 100x20 mm ID 5 /µrn Atlantis dC18 columns (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) in tandem. Gradient elution was carried out with liChrosolv water (A) and liChrosoiv acetonitrile (B) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as follows: 0-1 min<br>
80% A, 1-10 min linear gradient to 60% B, 10-11 min 60% B, 11-14 min linear gradient back to 80% A (initial conditions), 14-18 min 80% A (re-equilibration) (%, v/v). The flow rate was 15 ml/min. A Gilson (Villiers le Bel, France) pump model 321 with a liquidhandler model 215 was used, equipped with a UV detector (model UV/VIS-151) set at 276 run.<br>
800 µl of the crude N-lactoyl tyramine product was injected onto the system and a fraction was collected in the 8-10 min range. This run was repeated 10 times and combined fractions were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 48 °C.<br>
0.1 g of 95%+ pure N-lactoyl tyramine (measured by NMR) was obtained as a colorless oil.<br>
Example 3:<br>
For a tasting session the following solutions were prepared:<br>
1)	A solution of 0.025 % of a composition as prepared in example 1 in tap water;<br>
2)	A solution of 0.025 % of a composition as prepared in example 1 and 0.3 % NaCl in<br>
tap water;<br>
3)	A solution of 0.025 % of a composition as prepared in example 1, 0.3 % NaCl and 0.03<br>

4)	A solution of 0.005 % of a composition as prepared in example 2 in tap water;<br>
5)	A solution of 0.005 % of a composition as prepared in example 2 and 0.3 % NaCl in<br>
tap water; and<br>
6)	A solution of 0.005 % of a composition as prepared in example 2, 0.3 % NaCl and 0,03<br>
% mono sodium glutamate in tap water.<br>
All samples were tasted by a professional panel. There was general agreement about the differences in taste between the samples.<br>
Solutions 1) and 4) were described as having a clean mouthfeel, body and thickness. Solution 2) and 5) were described as having a longlasting effect, a clean mouthfeel, body and thickness and as bouillon-like.<br>
Solution 3) and 6) were described as having a longlasting effect, a strong clean mouthfeel, body and thickness and as strong, natural and complex bouillon-like.<br>
