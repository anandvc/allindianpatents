â€œPROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF NATEGLINIDE" CIPLA LIMITED.; 289 Bellasis Road, Mumbai central, Mumbai 400 008, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
2<br>
PROCESS<br>
The present invention is concerned with a one-pot process for the preparation of nateglinide, nateglinide prepared thereby, compositions containing the same, therapeutic uses thereof and methods of treatment employing the same.<br>
N-(trans-4-isopropyl cyclohexylcarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine, generally known as nateglinide, is an antidiabetic drug used as a hypoglycemic agent in patients with type II diabetes. Nateglinide has the following structural formula<br><br>
The synthesis of nateglinide is previously described in US 4816484, and employs the activated N-hydroxy succinimide ester of trans-4-isopropyl cyclohexanecarboxylic acid as an intermediate for condensation with a D-phenyl alanine alkyl ester. The alkyl ester of nateglinide shown below, where R is an alkyl group, is obtained after reaction between the above referred to activated ester of trans-4-isopropyl cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and a D-phenyl alanine alkyl ester<br><br>
3<br>
It is taught by US 4816484 that the above alkyl group acts as a protecting group, limiting the amount of undesirable side reactions. The overall process described in US 481684 for the preparation of nateglinide can be represented as follows<br><br>
However, it has now been found that by following the process as described in US 4816484, the nateglinide ester is found to be present in an undesirable amount in the final nateglinide product.<br><br>
4<br>
Also,  crystallization   of nateglinide  from  aqueous  methanol   results  in   undesirable   further esterification.<br>
Chinese Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 12, page no: 94, describes the synthesis of trans-4-isopropylcyciohexane carboxylic acid through reduction of 4-isopropylbenzoic acid, which on reaction with N-hydroxyphthalimide in presence of N'N'- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide gives the activated N-hydroxyphthalimide ester. This is subjected to acylation reaction with D-phenylalanine ethyl ester, and subsequent hydrolysis gives nateglinide.<br>
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1989, Vol. 32, No. 7, page no: 1437, describes the reaction of trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carboxylic acid with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form the activated N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. This is then reacted with D-phenylalanine methyl ester, and subsequent hydrolysis gives nateglinide.<br>
PCT Application WO2004/018408 describes a method for the synthesis of nateglinide which includes reacting trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carboxylic acid with an alkyl chloroformate of the formula CICO2R, where R is an alkyl group, to form a trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane mixed acid anhydride. The mixed acid anhydride is then reacted with an aqueous alkali salt solution of D-phenylalanine to yield a reaction mixture including nateglinide.<br>
US 5,463,116 discloses stable crystals of nateglinide. The nateglinide is first produced according to the method described in Example 3 of Japanese patent application laid open no. 63-54321 (an equivalent of US 4,816,484).<br>
EP1334963A discloses a method for producing nateglinide crystals from a reaction mixture containing nateglinide. The nateglinide is obtained by reacting trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carboxylic acid chloride with D-phenylalanine in a mixed solvent of a ketone and water in the presence of an alkali, followed by neutralisation with an acid. Specific adjustment of the temperature of the mixture and the concentration of ketone solvent results in precipitation of nateglinide crystals. The ketone solvent(s) in the reaction is usually essential to proceed the reaction. However, a large quantity of acetone in the reaction causes high proportion of by-product.<br>
PCT Application WO 2004/005240 describes a process for the preparation of nateglinide by reacting trans-4-isopropyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid chloride with a suitable salt of D-phenyl alanine in presence of an effective amount of an organic amide.<br><br>
5<br>
D-phenylalanine used as the starting material in the processes of EP1334963A and WO 2004/005240 is not protected by an alkyl group, so reaction of the unprotected carboxylic acid group leads to undesirable side products.<br>
There exists a need for improved processes for the preparation of nateglinide.<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, there is now provided a one-pot process for the preparation of nateglinide, which process comprises reacting an alkyl ester of D-phenylalanine of formula (II)<br><br>
where R represents C1-4alkyl, typically methyl, either as the free base or in salt form (typically the hydrochloride), with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid or trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide of formula (III)<br><br>
where X represents hydroxy or halo, typically chloro, to obtain a C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV), preferably the methyl ester of nateglinide<br><br>
followed by hydrolysis to yield nateglinide of formula (I)<br><br><br>
The two key intermediates required in the preparation of nateglinide are D-phenyl alanine and trans-4-cyclohexane carboxylic acid. It will be appreciated from the above overall reaction scheme provided for US 4816484 that this known synthesis involves a multi-step process comprising (a) esterification of D-phenyl alanine to get the ester as a hydrochloride, (b) releasing the free base, (c) preparing an active ester of trans-4- isopropylcyclohexane carboxylic acid, (d) coupling of (b) and (c) and finally (e) hydrolysis of the nateglinide ester to nateglinide. The present invention has, however, eliminated the part (c) of the process and combined the other four steps into<br>
a one-pot process. The present invention further provides a process to obtain pure nateglinide directly from the reaction, with removal of impurities being achieved by washing a solution of nateglinide in water with an organic solvent prior to its isolation substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail.<br>
A process according to the present invention preferably further comprises initially reacting D-phenyl alanine with a solution of thionyl chloride in a Ci_4alcohol, preferably methanol, to give the corresponding alkyl ester of formula (II), preferably the methyl ester, as the hydrochloride salt,<br><br>
7<br>
which can either be reacted directly with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid of formula (III) or can be converted to the free base prior to reaction therewith.<br>
According to a preferred first embodiment of the present invention, a process as provided thereby further comprises initially reacting D-phenyl alanine with a solution of thionyl chloride in a<br>
C|_4alcohoI, preferably methanol, to give the corresponding alkyl ester of formula (II), preferably the methyl ester, as the hydrochloride salt, which is then reacted directly with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid of above formula (III) in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or the like, and a base, such as<br>
triethylamine or the like, to give the above described C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV), preferably the methyl ester of nateglinide. The thus obtained C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV) is then preferably subjected to alkali hydrolysis, without isolation, and subsequent<br>
acidification to yield nateglinide. Suitably, where the alkali employed is sodium hydroxide, this provides nateglinide in the form of its sodium salt, which is then subjected to acidification as referred to above.<br>
Preferably a process according to the above described preferred first embodiment of the present invention can be represented by the following reaction scheme<br><br><br>
According to a preferred second embodiment of the present invention, a process as provided thereby further comprises initially reacting D-phenyl alanine with a solution of thionyl chloride in a C1-4alcohol, preferably methanol, to give the corresponding alkyl ester of formula (II), preferably<br>
the methyl ester, as the hydrochloride salt, which is converted in situ to the free base suitably using aqueous ammonia, and then reacted with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid of above formula (III) in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as N.N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-<br><br>
hydroxybenzotriazole or the like, to give the above described C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of<br>
formula (IV), preferably the methyl ester of nateglinide. The thus obtained C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV) is then preferably subjected to alkali hydrolysis, without isolation, and subsequent acidification to yield nateglinide. Suitably, where the alkali employed is sodium hydroxide, this provides nateglinide in the form of its sodium salt, which is then subjected to acidification as referred to above.<br>
Preferably a process according to the above described preferred second embodiment of the present invention can be represented by the following reaction scheme<br><br><br>
10<br>
According to a preferred third embodiment of the present invention, a process as provided thereby further comprises initially reacting D-phenyl alanine with a solution of thionyl chloride in a C1-4alcohol, preferably methanol, to give the corresponding alkyl ester of formula (II), preferably the methyl ester, as the hydrochloride salt, which is converted in situ to the free base suitably using aqueous ammonia, and then reacted with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide of above formula (III), preferably trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid chloride, in the presence of base such as triethylamine and N,N-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP), to give the above described C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV), preferably the methyl ester of nateglinide. The thus obtained C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV) is then preferably subjected to alkali hydrolysis, without isolation, and subsequent acidification to yield nateglinide. Suitably, where the alkali employed is sodium hydroxide, this provides nateglinide in the form of its sodium salt, which is then subjected to acidification as referred to above.<br>
Preferably a process according to the above described preferred third embodiment of the present invention can be represented by the following reaction scheme<br><br><br>
A process according to the present invention desirably further comprises purification of nateglinide by one or more solvent washes. After the above described reaction of an alkyl ester of D-phenylalanine of formula (II) with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid or trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide of formula (III), the reaction solution containing the alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV) is preferably washed with NaOH solution (typically 5%) to remove trans-4- isopropyl cyclohexanecarboxylic acid or trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide and other acid impurities. Furthermore, after the above described hydrolysis step to yield nateglinide of formula (I), purification of nateglinide from the methyl ester of nateglinide of formula (la) is preferably accomplished by washing the reaction mass comprising nateglinide with organic solvents typically selected from the group of water immiscible<br><br>
12<br>
organic solvents.   Preferably, the aqueous phase on acidification substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described yields nateglinide as white crystalline solid with total impurities being present at less than about 0.1%, with an overall yield of about 75%.<br>
According to the present invention, there is, therefore, further provided a one-pot process for the preparation of nateglinide, which process comprises reacting an alkyl ester of D-phenylalanine of formula (II)<br><br>
where R represents C1-4alkyl, typically methyl, either as the free base or in salt form (typically the hydrochloride), with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxyIic acid or trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide of formula (III)<br><br>
where X represents hydroxy or halo, typically chloro, to obtain a C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV), preferably the methyl ester of nateglinide<br><br><br>
wherein the reaction solution containing the above C1-4 alkyl ester of nateglinide of formula (IV) is washed with NaOH solution (typically 5%) to remove trans-4- isopropyl cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and other acid impurities, followed by alkali hydrolysis to yield nateglinide of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein the resulting reaction mass comprising nateglinide of formula (I) is washed with one or more water immiscible organic solvents, followed by acidification to yield crystalline nateglinide of formula (I).<br>
The main advantages of the process of the present invention are that (a) there is no isolation of an y intermediate (b) the processing time is reduced (c) it does not require any activation of the intermediate trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid and (d) the product obtained from the process does not require additional purification and / or crystallization.<br>
