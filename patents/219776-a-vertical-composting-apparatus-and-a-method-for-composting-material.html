Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a vertical composting apparatus and a method for composting material. The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for containing, composting, and reducing biodegradable waste, and more particularly to a vertical composting apparatus having discrete processing zones and a method of composting biodegradable materials using the inventive apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is well known to process and systematically decompose organic waste material using composting apparatus. Under pressure from a burgeoning population with a taste for unrestrained consumption, the development and use of composting systems and apparatus have evolved and matured rapidly; so too has the understanding of the decomposition process. It is now known that the thermophilic species of aerobic bacteria best suited for breaking down organic waste thrive only in limited ranges of environmental conditions. Those with knowledge in the art understand the importance of controlling several conditions to provide the optimal environment for a rapid decomposition process with a minimum of unpleasant odor. Such conditions include the porosity, temperature, oxygen level, and moisture content of the compost pile and the surrounding atmosphere.<br>
Curiously, the motivation compelling the development and use of composting systems, namely the reduction of organic waste, has failed to reduce the waste of physical space required by the composting systems themselves. Thus, in the commercial setting, it is common to provide large-scale composting systems predicated on a model of moving waste horizontally during the decomposition process. Such systems have a large footprint and require the use of a considerable area of potentially valuable land. Generally, the systems are located in remote, rural, agricultural areas, necessitating the transportation of large amounts of biodegradable waste from urban areas, if such areas are committed to the practice of composting. There is, as yet, no known system in the art that provides a large-scale vertical composting apparatus. Known systems are exemplified by those disclosed in the patents discussed below.<br>
A process for treatment by lumbricid-composting and device for its implementation is disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 5,527,373. An early method and apparatus is taught in U. S. Pat. No. 4,326, 874, to Burklin. The system entails preparing   the compost  material  on  a  storage  surface  in  which  layered  strips  of<br><br>
compost material are placed side-by-side with adjacent edges and at least one additional layer of compost material is placed on the adjacent strips. Hard substances are removed and the compost material then deposited by a rake-type conveyor member which is capable of being raised and lowered. An aerating system includes aerating lances that move into and from the compost material. Material is moved through the system on a belt-type horizontal conveyor.<br>
In the residential setting, it is known to provide composting apparatus employing horizontally stacked units to improve heat containment and aeration, and to simplify manual turning and mixing of the compost pile. For instance, U. S. Pat. No. 5,190, 572 to Long discloses a composter having a plurality of rectangular stackable boxes, each box having four interlocking double walled plastic panels. Each box can be secured above or below another box so that the boxes can be stacked to any height and the stacking order can be readily changed. The device includes a lid to cover the uppermost box in the stack. In use, the boxes are stacked between an original bottom box and an original top box over a first region of open ground to form a first stack. Biodegradable matter is placed into the composter and allowed to begin decomposing. After decomposition has occurred, the stacking order of boxes is reversed, thereby mixing and aerating the material and ostensibly promoting uniform decomposition. The restacking process also provides access to the interior of the compost mass.<br>
An earlier device is taught in U. S. Pat. No. 4,683, 674, to Paul, which shows a panel for use in a garden compost bin. The panel is shaped to allow horizontal and vertical nesting with like panels to create a cylindrical modular panel structure. As will be readily appreciated, neither Paul nor Long teaches an automated system suitable for large-scale, high-out composting.<br>
Systems more suitable to commercial use include that shown in U. S. Pat. No.6,352, 855 to Kerouac, which discloses an in-vessel composting apparatus and process for continuous processing of food waste into a two component end products consisting of a bulk organic compost material and a compost-rich, liquid tea. The apparatus includes a shredder/particle sizer feeding a horizontally disposed drum having at least three chambers with connecting ports of sequentially increasing diameter, and through to a bulk collection container. Motorized drum rotation and fluid drains in the first chamber hold a batch volume at elevated temperature for a period of time, and then percolate it through the finished<br><br>
compost product in the third or final chamber to make a nutrient-rich liquid compost tea. The apparatus is designed only for continuous input of raw waste and for horizontal movement of the processed material through a four-process, three-week throughput cycle.<br>
An active contributor to the art of continuous composting is Jack Wright of Canada. His patents include: U. S. Pat. Nos. 5,846, 815; 5,551, 969, and 5,409,831. In the '831 patent, Wright teaches a continuous composter which includes an enclosed elongate horizontally-disposed tunnel having a garbage inlet end with a mixing hopper, and an outlet end for the discharge of compost. A raised conveyor track comprising parallel rails with rollers is situated in the tunnel floor and extends the length of the tunnel. A train of conveyor trays travel on the track to move processing material. Each tray has a shunting frame and a foramenous base for the aeration of composting material. A ram urges the most upstream tray to advance downstream against the train of trays preceding it, thereby moving the entire train of trays. Aeration means provide air into a space between the tunnel floor and conveyor trays so that air rises through the bases of the trays and the material. A gas exhaust is provided at the top of the tunnel. Mixing rollers with paddles extend from sides of the tunnel to mix the garbage. The tunnel outlet has a pressure-closed hinged door that is urged open by an advancing conveyor tray.<br>
The '969 patent discloses an improved version of the system of the '831 patent, which includes the addition of a blending trough at the garbage inlet and water input means to add water immediately after mixing by the mixing rollers.<br>
The apparatus of the '815 patent improves on the devices disclosed in the '969 patent and the '831 patent. While providing the same horizontally-disposed tunnel having essentially the same footprint, and while providing the same mechanical means for moving composting material, it teaches the segregation of the composting apparatus into processing zones, each • having self-contained aeration units that minimize the interchange of air between the processing zones. If the apparatus includes only two processing zones, the first self-contained aeration unit aerates the upstream composting zone and recirculates a portion of venting aerating gases within the upstream zone; the second self-contained aeration unit aerates the downstream composting zone and recirculates a portion of its venting aerating gases within the downstream zone. Multi-chamber systems may be provided, with each processing zone having a self-contained aeration unit. The upstream and downstream zones may be separated by intermediate zones, blending with the upstream and downstream zones<br><br>
but tending to minimize any interchange of air between the zones. Each of Wright's systems are large, complex horizontal systems that are costly to manufacture. Additionally, the aeration system in the latest system is less than optimal in that it supplies air only to the underside of the composting material, rather than injecting air into the material piles; thus, substantial portions of the waste material may receive insufficient air flow and reduced aerobic activity.<br>
Finally, U. S. Pat. No. 6,171, 852, to Bright, discloses a composting system having a horizontally-disposed composting bay with inlet and outlet ends. A transport system on the bottom of the bay receives waste material and moves the material lengthwise along the length of the bay from the inlet to the outlet end. The system also includes movable fluid distribution cells including fluid injectors which inject water and air into the waste material as the material moves through the system.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 through 8, wherein like reference numerals refer to like components in the various views, FIG. 1 is a partial cross-sectional front-left perspective view of a first preferred embodiment of the vertical composting apparatus of the present invention, while FIGS. 2,3 and 4 are, respectively, a cross-sectional rear view and cross-sectional side view, and an axial, cross-sectional view thereof. These views show the inventive apparatus 100 in its most essential aspect comprises a vessel housing 110 having at least one housing wall!20. For purposes of composting waste according to the present invention, the vessel is preferably either generally cylindrical, in which event the wall is singular and contiguous, or cuboid, in which event the housing has four walls comprising sides. However, in the first preferred embodiment the vessel housing is cuboid and is supported on a frame 130. Vessel dimensions will vary according to the scale of the composting operation, though heights ranging from approximately nine to eighteen meters (thirty to sixty feet) have proven most serviceable and work best for materials processed for a typical resonance time in a plug-flow system.<br>
A waste inlet 140 is located at the top of the housing above an upper processing zone 150. The inlet may be either directly above the upper processing zone or to the side, depending upon the means provided for distributing and spreading the waste before<br><br>
introduction into the first processing zone. Positioned below the first processing zone is a lower processing zone 160.<br>
Waste introduced into the housing through the waste inlet is leveled and evenly distributed over the upper processing zone by leveling means 170, preferably comprising at least one auger screw having either continuous solid or ribbon flights. It will be appreciated, however, that numerous suitable alternative means may be employed, including, for instance, a rotary leveler (as illustrated in FIG. 8). The at least one auger screw is driven by a reversible motor 180, which permits periodic and systematic movement of the waste material in each direction along the length of the auger screw.<br>
At least one upper agitating device 190 is interposed between the upper processing zone 150 and the lower processing zone 160. Preferably the agitating device comprises a first set of side-by-side rollers 200,210, each of which include a plurality of surface paddles or bars 220. The rollers are actuated by one or more reversible motors, 230. When operated, the rollers are preferably rotated in opposite directions such that when viewed from either end, the left hand roller rotates clockwise and toward the right hand roller, and the right hand roller rotates counterclockwise and toward the left hand roller. However, each roller may also be rotated in the opposite direction, as long as both rollers are not simultaneously rotated in the same direction.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the agitating device may be replaced by a different, non-agitating device such as a stationary grid, bars, a moving floor, slide gate, or a hatch. In these embodiments, the device, which separates the different zones in the apparatus, keeps the weight of compost material in the upper region of the composting apparatus from compressing composting material at the lower region of the composting apparatus. The fundamental concept of processing the compost in vertically disposed but discrete processing zones is nonetheless preserved in such embodiments.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the present in invention, a lower agitation device 250 is positioned at the base of the lower processing zone 160. Preferably the agitation device comprises a second set of side-by-side rollers 260,270 that operate in the manner as described above. The second set of rollers is actuated by at least one second motor 280.<br><br>
Throughout the composting cycle, the agitation means are operated at predetermined intervals. The agitators mix, delump, aerate, and turn over the compost material inside vessel. The agitation means also support the compost material above them so that the full weight of compost pile does not compact the compost material below it, thereby limiting oxygen supply to material deep within the pile. Effective agitation can be enhanced by the provision of one or more baffle plates 240 positioned on the interior surface (s) of the vessel housing. Alternatively, the vessel housing itself include inwardly tapering walls 290, in the fashion of a hopper, to direct the material flow into the agitators and through the opening at the lower portion of the processing zone.<br>
A discharge outlet 300 is positioned directly below the lower agitation device. This portion of the vessel housing is configured to direct finished compost into a discharge conveyor system 310, preferably a screw auger, which transports nutrient rich plant growth media from the apparatus to holding bins or other containers to await use.<br>
For large scale processing of biodegradable waste, it is preferable for the inventive system to include a waste input conveyor system 320, preferably a vertically disposed bucket conveyor. The preference of conveyor type is driven by the angle or orientation of the system, and the orientation is directed to advancing the space-saving purpose of the inventive apparatus, though it is not critical to its effective function. Thus, alternative systems could be employed if the conveyor were more horizontally disposed. The waste input conveyor system includes a waste loading inlet 330, a vertically disposed tube 340, a motor driven bucket conveyor cable 350, and a material outlet 360, all of which are well known in the art.<br>
Misting nozzles 380 may be positioned in any processing zone to increase the humidity of the atmosphere and to increase the water content of the compost pile. Optimally added water will not be required in the upper processing zone.<br>
FIGS. 5 through 7 illustrate a second preferred embodiment 400 of the present invention. Reference numerals in these views indicate identical elements to those in FIGS. 1-4. These views show the inventive apparatus as having an additional, intermediate processing zone 410, interposed between the upper processing zone 150 and the lower processing zone 160. Provision of one or more intermediate processing zones requires the concomitant provision of one or more intermediate agitation devices 420, preferably a third set of rollers 430,440, as well as a third motor system 450.<br><br>
Environmental control systems may be provided to tightly regulate the conditions under which the material is processed during the resonance period. As noted, misting nozzles can be provided to add water to selected processing zones. Additionally, temperature, oxygen level, and moisture level sensors may be installed in one or more of the processing zones so that adverse conditions can be corrected promptly. The sensors are not shown as they are common and well known in the art. The system may further include gas outlet duct 460 for venting and removing exhaust gasses produced by the composting process. The air removed from the system may be processed in a bio-filter 470, released directly into the atmosphere (if appropriate and permitted), or directed into a ground berm. Either fresh or recycled air may be directed into the vessel housing via air inlet 480, and such may be heated or cooled by a heating and cooling unit 490. All of the environmental systems are preferably coordinated with one another, as well as with the agitation systems, through programmable logic means, either a PLC 500 or a computer.<br>
FIG.8 is a perspective view of a third preferred embodiment 600 of the vertical composting apparatus of the present invention. This view shows a system having a cylindrical housing 610, an upper processing zone 620 and a lower processing zone 630, a waste inlet 640 through which biodegradable waste is conveyed into the upper processing zone by a waste conveyor system 650, and one or more discharge outlets 660 through which compost is directed to a discharge conveyor system 670. The system may include hydration means (not shown), temperature control and regulation means (not shown), and exhaust and air conditioning means, preferably a bio-filter 680 in fluid communication with the vessel interior through air inlet and outlet ducts 690, 700, respectively.<br>
Unlike the first and second embodiments discussed above, the third preferred embodiment separates the upper and lower processing zones, and the lower processing zone and the discharge outlets, with floors 710, 720, having openings 710a, 710b, 720a, 720b, selectively exposed or closed by slide gates 730, 740. The slide gates are actuated by gate actuating means, 750, 760, preferably hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, as are well known in the art. Agitation means are provided, preferably comprising a shaft 770 vertically disposed in the processing zones, the shaft having a plurality of arms 780 extending radially from the shaft to engage and project into the compost pile in each processing zone, and to break up.<br><br>
delump, and aerate the pile when operated. Actuation of the shaft is by a motor (not shown) coupled to the shaft at one end 790.<br>
Method Steps: The following steps comprise the essential processing sequence in employing the vertical composting apparatus of the present invention:<br>
(1) Organic waste (biodegradable waste) is combined with a bulking agent (wood chips, sawdust, etc.) to achieve a proper carbon to nitrogen ration and a correct porosity in waste material mixture.<br>
(2)	The organic waste and bulking agent are mixed thoroughly (typically in a automated four auger mixer, though this can also be accomplished with a front loader or an equivalent method).<br>
(3)	The mixed organic waste and bulking agent are loaded into a bucket elevator receiving hopper. This is typically accomplished with a conveyer, though it can also be done with a front loader or an equivalent method.<br>
(4)	The waste mixture is vertically conveyed by bucket elevator to the top of the composting apparatus.<br>
(5)	The waste mixture is deposited into the top of the composting apparatus.<br>
(6)	The waste mixture is distributed evenly in the horizontal plane by leveling screws into the upper processing zone in the composting apparatus.<br>
(7)	The waste mixture is retained in the upper processing zone for approximately seven days. Each day the waste mixture is moving down as compost is unloaded and new waste is added).<br>
(8)	The waste mixture reaches the agitation system rollers on approximately the seventh day.<br>
(9)	The waste mixture is turned, agitated, de-lumped and forced into the lower processing zone by the agitation system rollers.<br><br>
(10)	Water is added to the waste mixture if needed to maintain adequate moisture content after the waste mixture passes through the agitation system rollers.<br>
(11)	The waste mixture is retained in the lower processing zone for approximately seven additional days. Each day the waste mixture progressively moves down as compost is unloaded and new waste is added.<br>
(12)	After approximately the fourteenth day, retention in the composting apparatus waste mixture has been stabilized to meet pathogen destruction and vector attraction regulations and now comprises a nutrient rich plant growth media.<br><br>
(13) Plant growth media is discharged from the bottom of the composting apparatus via screw conveyor or an equivalent method for further post processing (such as curing, drying, screening, bagging, etc.).<br>
Monitoring/Controls: The following controls and monitoring systems may be employed to ensure the maintenance of optimum composting conditions:<br>
(1)	Vertically oriented temperature probes may be permanently fixed in the center of the composting mass to give continuous feedback to the control panel which activates fans or blowers to effectively regulate temperature and oxygen within the composting mass. The temperature may be controlled so as not to exceed 71 C (160 degrees Fahrenheit) and not to go below 54 C (131 degrees Fahrenheit). Positive air may be pushed by blowers into the bottom of the composting mass and negative air pressure is exerted on top of the composting mass to pull air from the top of the composting mass to a bio-filter. The bio-filter may include a specific mixture of stabilized mature compost, woodchips and other filtering media to clean exhaust air in order to prevent odor from being emitted into the surrounding environment. Other air filtration devices can be utilized to scrub or clean the air instead of a bio-filter.<br>
(2)	Moisture sensors can be positioned throughout the composting mass to give continuous feedback to the control panel which activates irrigation emitters to control moisture content of the composting material. The moisture level of the composting mass can be maintained at approximately 60% to optimize the composting process.<br>
(3)	All leachate (waste liquid) generated during the composting process can be contained and diverted for appropriate handling. Leachate can be recycled and used for irrigation purposes or can be diverted to a drain or container for disposal.<br>
