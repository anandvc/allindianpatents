				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a cooling device comprising a housing with at least one<br>
cooling channel for a cooling liquid, and with at least one thermoelectric cooling<br>
element comprising a layer of semiconductor material that is sandwiched<br>
between two plates, at least one of the plates presenting an electrically<br>
insulating contact surface that, in use, is in direct contact with the cooling liquid,<br>
that at least one cooling element being sealingly mounted in a carrier such that<br>
the contact surface remains free to contact the cooling liquid, the carrier and the<br>
contact surface defining a wall portion of the cooling channel.<br>
Such a cooling device is known from US 5 918 469. In the cooling device of US 5<br>
918 469, the cooling element is clamped in the carrier with a gasket positioned<br>
on the top plate of the cooling element to provide a seal.<br>
US 6 119 462 discloses a water cooler having a thermoelectric cooling element<br>
for maintaining a supply of water at a reduced temperature level. The Cooling<br>
element is clamped between two flanges of the housing, such that the warm side<br>
of the module is in direct contact with cooling liquid flowing through the cooling<br>
channel, thus enabling an efficient cooling process, while the cold side of the<br>
module abuts against the base of a chiller probe that is in conductive thermal<br>
contact with the supply of water to be cooled.<br>
A problem associated with the known devices is that the clamp construction may<br>
cause leakage due to thermal expansion and contraction of the cooling element.<br>
In addition, the tolerance for size and shape of the thermoelectric element must<br>
be kept small, and the clamping force must be relatively high. In view of the<br>
above, only one cooling element can be used in each clamp construction.<br>
Further, due to their brittle structure, low cost cooling elements of semiconductor<br>
material sandwiched between ceramic plates of low size and shape tolerance<br>
cannot be used in mechanically demanding applications.<br>
The invention aims to provide a cooling device in which the advantage of<br>
efficient cooling by direct contact of the cooling element with the cooling liquid is<br>
maintained, while the above problems are alleviated. In particular, the invention<br>
aims to provide a cooling device in which an array of standardized cooling<br>
elements of semiconductor material sandwiched between plates of ceramic<br>
material, each having low size and shape tolerance can be provided in a simple<br>
and elegant manner.<br>
According there is provided a cooling device having the features of the invention.<br>
By flexibly and sealingly framing the cooling element along its outer perimeter,<br>
the size and shape tolerance and the thermal expansion and contraction of the<br><br>
element can be compensated for. By framing the cooling element along its outer<br>
perimeter, only the circumference of the cooling element is framed, while the<br>
contact surface can remain free to contact the cooling liquid. Within this context,<br>
the outer perimeter of the cooling element is meant to comprise the outer edge<br>
of the surface of the plates and at least a portion of the rim of that plate.<br>
By arranging the carrier and the contact surface to define a wall portion of the<br>
cooling channel, the carrier and the cooling element frame therein can be used in<br>
an elegant manner to close off the cooling channel. The contact surface and the<br>
portion of the carrier being in contact with the liquid together form a barrier<br>
shielding the electronics of the cooling element and other parts of the cooling<br>
device from the cooling liquid. The electrically insulating contact surface allows<br>
for the use of normal water as cooling liquid. Preferably, the insulating contact<br>
surface is part of the plate surface, e.g. the plate surface of a ceramic plate.<br>
By flexibly and sealingly framing the cooling element, assembly can be less<br>
delicate and the lifetime of the cooling elements can be extended. In particular,<br>
standard peltier elements comprising a ceramic upper layer and a ceramic lower<br>
layer sandwiching a layer of semiconductor material can be used in mechanically<br>
demanding applications and/or applications that require relatively high cooling<br>
capacities, such as car climate control systems and................................................<br>
portable cooling boxes. Advantageously, a plurality of cooling elements can be<br>
framed in a single carrier.<br>
Preferably, the carrier comprises a rigid framework in which the at<br>
least one cooling element is framed by means of a flexible packing. The flexible<br>
sealing can then be interposed between the carrier and the cooling element.<br>
The packing is preferably formed as a flexible gasket, e.g. a round or a<br>
rectangular packing ring having a C-, L- or H-shaped cross section.<br>
Preferably, the framework comprises an upper portion and a lower<br>
portion between which at least one cooling element is sealingly clamped.<br>
Alternatively, the framework can be formed as a singular unit, e.g. by injection<br>
molding around the cooling elements. In this way the cooling elements can be<br>
framed in an elegant and efficient manner. Preferably, at least one cooling<br>
element is a flat, rectangular sandwich.<br>
In an elegant manner, the carrier is substantially planar and frames<br>
a plurality of cooling elements, arranged in a row or matrix within a plane.<br>
This allows for a cheap and elegant manner to provide a high capacity cooling<br>
device. Naturally, the cooling elements can also be stacked e.g. by stacking a<br>
plurality of carriers, each comprising one or more cooling elements.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the carrier comprises a flexible body<br>
in which the at least one cooling element is directly framed. Such a carrier,<br>
which may have a matlike structure, can e.g. be provided by embedding a<br>
plurality of cooling elements in a layer of elastomeric material that keeps the<br>
contact surfaces of the cooling elements free. A suitable material for such a<br>
carrier is e.g. silicone material or liquid packing material. In an advantageous<br>
manner, such a flexible carrier may be provided with reinforcement elements,<br>
e.g. embedded rods or stiffening strips on the surface to prevent sagging of the<br>
wall portion of the cooling channel formed therewith.<br>
In yet a further embodiment, the housing comprises two cooling<br>
channels and the at least one cooling element that is framed in the carrier<br>
comprises opposite contact surfaces on both plates of the cooling element, the .<br>
carrier and the framed cooling elements thus forming a partition between the<br>
cooling channels. This allows for a highly compact construction with efficient<br>
cooling.<br>
In an elegant manner, the cooling device can be assembled from two<br>
housing portions, each having an open cooling channel between which the<br>
carrier with framed cooling elements is interposed to close off the cooling<br>
channels by forming a partition. To enhance thermal exchange, in at least one<br>
of the cooling channels the cooling liquid is forced to move through the<br>
channel, preferably in both channels, to increase the cooling capacity. By<br>
providing turbulators on the contact surface and/or in the cooling channels, the<br>
heat exchange can be increased even further.<br>
Elegantly, the plates of the cooling elements present a plate surface<br>
that is impregnated. This way, in case of a porous plate material, such as<br>
ceramics, absorption of the cooling liquid into the plate material at the contact<br>
surface can be prevented. Alternatively, the cooling element can carry a film<br>
that forms the contact surface. This way, an electrically conducting plate can<br>
be provided with an electrically insulating contact surface.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the plate surface has a surface structure<br>
for increasing the contact area with the cooling liquid. This way, the<br>
thermoelectric cooling element can be provided with a higher heat exchanging<br>
efficiency, but it can, due its way of framing, still be leakfree. Preferably, the<br>
increased contact surface is formed by grooves in the ceramic surface material<br>
of a plate or as ceramic protrusions on the ceramic surface of the plate.<br>
Although this embodiment allows for high efficiency in heat exchange, it shall<br>
be clear that it is also possible to provide cooling fins of other means for<br>
increasing the contact surface that are not integrated with the plate and that<br>
are e.g. glued to the plate surface. It shall further be clear that a<br>
thermoelectric cooling element comprising a layer of semi-conductor material<br>
sandwiched between two ceramic plates of which at least one plate is provided<br>
with a plate surface with a surface structure for increasing the contact area<br>
that is integrated in the ceramic material, can be used advantageously in other<br>
types of cooling devices or in other applications. It shall be clear that, as<br>
defined in this context, the contact surface presented on the plate surface and<br>
is equal to or lesser in area than the plate surface, depending on the way the<br>
cooling element is framed, and preferably lies on the plate surface.<br>
The invention also relates to a carrier in which thermoelectric<br>
cooling elements are flexibly and sealingly framed.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are described<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention shall be illucidated using exemplary embodiments<br>
shown in the drawing. In the drawings<br>

Fig. 8 shows a schematic view of a cooling device according to the<br>
invention assembled in a motor cooling system of motor vehicles to serve as an<br>
air conditioning system.<br>
The figures show only a schematic view of preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention. The described embodiments are given by way of non-limiting<br>
examples of exemplary embodiments of the invention. In the drawings,<br>
identical or corresponding parts are provided with the same reference<br>
numerals.<br>
Figures 1-7 show a cooling device 1 having a housing 2 comprising<br>
several layers of parts. A carrier 3 comprises a rigid upper portion 4 and a<br>
rigid lower portion 5 each of them provided with rectangular apertures 6 with<br>
recesses 7 for receiving a plurality of identical cooling elements 8 arranged in a<br>
matrix structure within a plane. The upper sides of the strips 9 between the<br>
apertures 6 are in case of the upper carrier portion or part 4 provided with<br>
semi-spherical bulges 10 for conducting cooling liquid 15 in a cooling channel<br>
11 as will be explained in more detail in the following. In case of the lower<br>
carrier portion or part 5 the semi-spherical bulges 10 are provided on the lower<br>
sides of the strips 9 between the apertures 6.<br>
The cooling elements 8 are commercial available flat thermoelectric<br>
coolers (TEC's), also known as peltier elements. In this embodiment the cooling<br>
elements 8 have a substantially rectangular form, but it is noted that each<br>
specific shape is in principle suited for application of the invention. The<br>
coooling element 8 also consists of a number of layers, thus forming a<br>
sandwich. The planar upper layer 14a and the lower layer 14b comprise<br>
ceramic plates 14, while a semiconductor layer 12 generates in the working<br>
mode a temperature difference between the upper ceramic plate 14a and the<br>
lower ceramic plate 14b. The cooling element 8 may also comprise more layers,<br>
e.g. metal plates with electrical interconnections 13 for providing an electrical<br>
current to the semiconductor layer 12.<br>
The thermoelectric coolers 8 are incorporated or framed between the<br>
upper carrier part 4 and the lower carrier part 5 employing flexible gaskets 16<br>
which are interposed between the thermoelectric coolers 8 and the carrier<br>
parts 4, 5. More precisely, the flexible gaskets 16 in the form of a rectangular<br>
packet ring clamp the thermoelectric coolers 8 along its outer perimeter 17<br>
sealingly in the carrier parts 4, 5. In this context the outer perimeter 17 is<br>
defined as the outer edge of at least one of the plates 14 inclusive at least a<br>
portion of the rim of that plate. The abovementioned assemblage procedure<br>
permits the cooling element 8 to have at least one contact surface 18 which in<br>
process is in direct contact with the cooling liquid 15. In this embodiment both<br>
opposite ceramic plates 14 have a contact surface 18 which during process is in<br>
direct contact with the cooling liquid 15, such that the contact surfaces 18 of<br>
the cooling elements 8 form in combination with the carrier 3 a partition for<br>
the cooling liquid 15 in the cooling channels 11 on each side of the carrier 3,<br>
thus avoiding leakage of the cooling liquid 15 to the electronic interconnections<br>
13 and other parts of the cooling elements 8.<br>
In order to admit different kinds of cooling liquids 15 the contact<br>
surfaces 18 represented by the plates 14 of the cooling elements 8 are<br>
electrically insulating. To that end electrically conducting plates 14 may be<br>
provided with an insulating film 20, as may explicitly be seen in Figs. 6 and 7.<br>
Otherwise, the plates 14 may be impregnated to obtain an electrically<br>
insulating contact surface. Moreover, ceramic plates, being porous material,<br>
become less sensitive to water absorption when the plate surface is<br>
impregnated.<br>
The carrier is further sandwiched between an upper housing part 22<br>
and a lower housing part 23 with interposed anti-leakage strips 21 to form the<br>
housing 2 with cooling channels 11. The upper cooling channel 11 is on the<br>
lower side defined by the partitioning comprising the carrier 3 and the upper<br>
contact surfaces 18 of the cooling elements 8, while it is on the upper side<br>
defined by the upper housing part 22. As may be seen most obviously in Fig. 4,<br>
the lower part of the upper housing part 22 comprises cavities 24<br>
corresponding with the semi-spherical bulges 10 of the upper carrier part 4.<br>
This configuration permits a relatively narrow channel geometry which<br>
enables a relatively high flow of the cooling liquid 15 and improves the cooling<br>
efficiency. The flow of the cooling liquid 15 may be enforced by means of a<br>
pump (not shown). Further, the upper housing part 22 is provided with an<br>
inflow coupling unit 25 and an outflow coupling unit 26 which are connected to<br>
the upper channel configuration 11. The lower cooling channel 11 and the<br>
lower housing part 23 are configured in a similar way. The entire assembly is<br>
clamped by means of bolts 27, rings 28 and nuts 29.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1-5 the cooling device 1 thus comprises a housing<br>
2 with at least one cooling channel 11 for a cooling liquid 15, and with at least<br>
one thermoelectric cooling element 8 comprising a layer of semiconductor<br>
material 12 that is sandwiched between two plates 14. At least one of the<br>
plates 14 presents an electrically insulation contact surface 18 that, in use, is<br>
in direct contact with the cooling liquid 15. The at least one cooling element 8<br>
is along its outer perimeter 17 flexibly and sealingly framed in a carrier 3 such<br>
that the contact surface 18 remains free to contact the cooling liquid 15. The<br>
carrier 3 and the contact surface 18 define a wall portion of the cooling channel<br>
11.<br>
Finally, Fig. 8 shows an application of the electric cooling device 1<br>
assembled in a motor cooling system 30 of motor vehicles in order to provide an<br>
air conditioning feature to a climate control system. A conventional cooling<br>
system of a motor M is provided with a large cooling radiator R1 in front of the<br>
motor M and a small cooling radiator R2 in the cabin for heater purposes (not<br>
shown), both accomplished with vans 32. The warm liquid of the electric<br>
cooling device 1 according to the invention is cooled employing the large<br>
cooling radiator R1. This configuration demonstrates a cheap and efficient<br>
cooling application in motor cars.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described in the<br>
application. Many variants are possible. Similar variants shall be clear to the<br>
