				<td>This invention relates to novel benzoxazoclne compounds which inhibit monoamine reuptake and their therapeutic use. Backoround of the Invention<br>
Nefopam f(± )-3.4.5.6-tetrahvdro-5-methvl-1 phenyl-1 H-2,5-benzQxazocine hydrochloride] is a centrally acting non-narcotic analgesic not structurally related to other analgesics. Nefopam has been shown to induce antinociception in animal models of pain and in humans (reviewed in Heel etal., 1980). However, nefopam is not active in the mouse tall-flick test, or the hot plate test and the Randall-Selitto pressure test in rats (Conway and Mitchell, 1977) suggesting that its analgesic meCHanism is not opiate-like or anti-inflammatory in nature. Nefopam's antinociception is not blocked by nalaxone further suggesting that its analgesic action   is   not through  opiate  receptors.  Although the  precise meCHanism of antinociception is not knovm it is thought to involve inhibition of synaptosomal    uptake    of    dopamine,     norepinephrine    and    serotonin (VonVoigtiander et a/., 1983; Rowland and Hole, 1990; Mather et ai, 2001). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies with nefopam enantiornere haveSbown that (+)-nefopam has more potent analgesic and dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin uptake inhibitory properties than (-)-nefopam with the order of potency given as (+)-nefopam &gt; (±)-nefopam &gt; (-)-nefopam (Fasmeref a/., 1987; Rosland and Hole, 1990; Mather et al, 2001). summary of the Invention<br>

It will be appreciated that the compourvSs according to the invention contain an asymmetricaUy si ihstitued carabon atom. The presence of this asymmetric centrejn compound of formula (1) can give rise to stereoisomers, and in each case the invention is to be understood to extend to atl such stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures including racemic and non-racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
As used in this specification, alone or in combination, the *erm "C1-C6 alkyl" refers to straight or branched CHain alkyl moiety having from one to six carbon atoms, Including for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like.<br>
The term "C2-C6 alkenyl" refers to a straight or branched CHain alkyl moiety having two to six carbon atoms and having in addition one double bond, of either E or Z stereochemistry where applicable. This term would include for example, vinyl, 1-propenyl, 1- and 2- butenyl, 2- methyl-2-propenyl etc.<br>
The term "C2-C6 alkynyl" refers to a straight or branched CHain alkyl moiety having two to six carbon atoms and having in addition one triple t&gt;ond. This term would Include for example, ethynyl, 1 -propargyl, 1 - and 2- butynyl etc.<br>
The term "C3-C6 cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated alicydic moiety having from three to six carbon atoms and includes for example cyclopropyl, cyckjbutyl. cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like.<br>
The term "aryl" means an optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl group.<br>

The term "halogen" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Compounds of the general formula (1) may be prepared by any suitable method known in the art and/or by the processes described below. It will be appreciated that where a particular stereoisomer of formula (1) is required, the synthetic processes described herein may be used with the appropriate homochiral starting material and/or isomers maybe resolved from mixtures using conventional separation techniques (e.g.   HPLC).<br>
The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by the following process. In the description and formulae below the groups R1, R2, R3, R4, R5. R6, W, X, Y and Z are as defined above, except where otherwise indicated. It will be appreciated that functional groups, such as amino, hydroxy I or carboxyl groups, present in the various compounds described below, and which it is desired to retain, may need to be in protected form before any reaction is initiated. In such instances, removal of the protecting group may be the final step in a particular reaction. Suitable protecting groups for such functionality will be apparent to those skilied in the art.  For specific details see<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley Interscience, TW Greene, PGM Wuts.<br>
A process required for preparing compounds of general formula (1), where W, X, Y or Z are N or C-Br comprises acid (for instance p-toluenesuiphonic acid) cyclisation of the diol of general formula (2) which can in turn be obtained by reduction of the ketone (3) with a suitable reducing agent. <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Reduction of a keto amide of general formula (3) can be carried out with<br>
reagents well known to those familiar in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. An example of a highly reactive reducing agent is lithium aluminium hydride, although reagents based on borane (e.g. borane.tetrahydrofuran complex) or modified sodium borohydride reduction (e.g. with a nickel or cobalt sait enhancer) are equally effective.<br>
Equally, reduction of the ketone in (3), for example with sodium borohydride, followed by acid cyclisation, for example with p-toluenesulphionic acid, then ultimate reduction of the amide group, for example with borane, aiso leads to compounds of general formula (1).<br>
Ketones of general formula (3) can be prepared by condensation of a carboxyiic acid of general formuia (4) or an active -derivative thereof, with an<br>
amine of formula (5).   Active derivatives of acids of formula (4) include for example acid anhydrides or acid lialides, such as acid chlorides. (Formula Removed)<br>
The coupling reiction may be performed usirg standard conaitions for amidation reactions of this type. Thus, the reaction may be achieved In a solvent, for example an inert organic solvent such as an ether, e.g. acyclicether such as tetrahydrofuran, an amide e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane at a low temperature e.g. -30°C to ambient temperatuR6, such as -20°C to 0°C, optionally in the presence of as base. e.g. an organic base such as an amine, e.g. triethylamine or a cyclic amine such as .V-methy!morpholine. Where an acid of formula (4) is used directly, the reaction may additionally be performed in the presence of a condensing agent, for example a diimide such as N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, advantageously in the presence of a triazole such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively, the acid may be reacted with a chioroformate, for example ethyl chloroformate, prior to reaction with the amine of formula (5).<br>
Acids of general formula (4) are prepared by Friedel-Crafts acyiation of an arene of general formula (6) with an anhydride of formula (7). This reaction is carried out in an Inert solvent (such as dichtoromethane) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst {such as aluminium trichloride).<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
It is well recognised by those skilled in the art that such reactions may provide mixtures of products and in turn that these mixtures can often be separated by tradition flash column chromatography. For example, where Y = C-Br and W = X = Z = CH and Ra and Ra are H, Friedel-Crafts acylation under aluminium trichloride catalysis provides two isomeric bromides (4a) and (4b). These can be readily separated by column chromatography and IrKlependently progressed to compouna. of general formula (1), wherein X or Y are C-Br, by the route described above. (Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds of general formula (1) where either W, X, Y or Z is CR4 and<br>
R4 is a halogen such as Br (1a) represent flexible interniediates that may be used for the preparation of other compounds of general formula (1). For instance, compounds of general formula (1) where either W, X, YorZ is CR4and R4 Is Brcan be smoothly converted into the corresponding nitrile (1b; R4 - CN) either by react/on with cuprous cyanide in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as A/-<br>
methylpyrroiidinonG    (NMP)       or   under   palladium-catalysed    conditions (Scheme 1).<br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br><br>
The nltrile of general formula (1) where either W, X, Y or Z is CR4 and R4 is CN (1b) can be readily converted, by hydrolysis, into the primary amide (1c, R4 = CONH2), esters and the corresponding carboxylic acid (Id, CO2R1) or into the corresponding tetrazole (1e) by treatment with a suitable azide donor such as<br>
sodium azide or trimethylsilylazide <br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br><br>
In addition, compounds of general formula (1) where either W, X, YorZ is CR4 and R4 is a halogen such as Br (1a) can be lithiated with n-, sec-, or tert-butyllithium in an inert organic solvent such as an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran at very low temperatuR6, e.g. -78°C. Treatment with either a carbon (e.g. carbon dioxide, N,N-dimethyl formamide or paraformaldehyde),<br>
sulphur (e.g. SO2CI2, followed by amidation, such as with ammonia) or nitrogen (dlphenylphosphoryl azide, followed by reduction, such as with REDAL) provides access, by subsequent derivatlsation to derivatives where R4 is CO2R1; CON(R1)2 (where each R4 is the same or different); CH2OR1 (If), S02N(R1)2 (1g, where each Ri is the same or different); and NR1COR5; NR1SO2R5 (1h); NR1CO2R5; NRiGON(R1)2 (where each R1 is the same or different). Examples are given in Scheme 3.<br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br><br>
In addition, compounds of general formula (1) where either W, X,Y or Z is CR4 and R4 is a halogen such as Br (1a) can undergo palladium-catalysed coupling reactions with carbon-based coupling partneR5. Thus, compounds of general formula (1) where either W, X, Y or Z is CR4 and R4 is a halogen such as Br can be coupled to alkenes of a general type CH2=CHR4 under Heck conditions, alkynes of a general type CH=CHR4 under Sonogoshira conditions,<br>
or metalloheterocycles e.g. where the metal is tin, under Stills coupling conditions. This gives access to compounds where either W, X, Y or Z can be C2-C6 alkenyl substituted with R4 (11) C2-C6 alkynyl substituted with R4 (1j) and where R4 is a five membered aromatic heterocycie containing 1-4 heteroatoms taken from N (such as in pyrrole, diazoles, triazoles or tetrazoles for example) and O (such as in furan (1k), oxazoies or oxadiazoles for example). Such coupling reactions ensure that CHains and rings are linked either through carbon. Examples are in Scheme 4.<br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br><br>
In addition to the examples described above, additional compounds of formula (1) rnay be prepared by interconversion of other compounds of formula<br>
 (1).   Thus, for example, a compound of formula (11) wherein R4 is a C1-6 alky! group may be prepared by hydrogenation (using palladium on carbon In suitable solvent, such as an alcohol - e.g. ethanol) of a compound of formula (1i) wherein R4 IS a C2-6 aikenyl group (e.g. as in Scheme 5). Scheme 5:<br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br>
Any mixtures of final products or intermediates obtained can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, In  Known<br>
manner, into the pi ire final products or internrediates, for example by chromatography, distillation, fractional crystallization, or by formation of a salt if appropriate or possible under the circumstances.<br>
The compounds according to the invention exhibit in vitro inhibiting activities with respect to monoamine (i.e. noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine) reuptake. The activity and selectivity of the compounds may be determined by use of an appropriate monoamine reuptake assay.<br>
This invention also relates to a method of treatment for patients (including man and/or mammalian animals raised in the dairy, meat or fur industries or as pets) suffering from disorders or diseases which can be attributed to monoamine reuptake as previously described, and more specifically, a method of treatment<br>
involving the administration of the monoamine reuptake inhibitor of fomiuia 
Accordingly, the compounds of formula (1) can be used among other things in the treatment of pain and emesis but also may find utility in a range of other therapeutic indications such as depression, post traumatic stress disorders, attention deficit disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, premenstrual syndrome, substance abuse and sexual dysfunction;<br>
a method of management (by which is meant treatment of prophyiaxis) of disease or conditions mediated by monoamine reuptake in mammals, in particular in humans, which method comprises administering to the mammal an effective, amount of a compound of formula (1) above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
and a compound of formula (1) for use in human or veterinary medicine, particularly in the management (by which is meant treatment or prophylaxis) of diseases or conditions mediated by monoamine reuptake;<br>

These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption In the gastointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.   For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyeryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques descrbed in the  US  Patents 4,2*56.108;4.166,452;  snd 4,266.874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules where in the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for exannple calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcelluiose, methylcellulose,    hydroxypropylmethylcelkjjose,   sodium   alginate   polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally occuring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long CHain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, orcorKiensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters dervied from fatty acids and a hexitol such a polyoxyethylene with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.

Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbto ackl.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a disfjersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspendlng agents are exemplified, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturelly-oocuring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occuring phosphatides, for example soya bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan  monooleate.     The emulsions may also contain  sweetening  and flavouring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example gycerot, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oJeagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be in a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenteraJly-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be eruptoyed iixiiuding synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These composKlons can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter aci polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc containing the compounds of Formula (1) are employed. For the purposes of this application, topical application includes mouth washes and gargles.<br>
Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.05 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 2.5 mg to about 7 gms per patient per day). For example, emesis may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 gms per patient per day).<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specifrc compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
