				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a reproducing apparatus to read and reproduce data from a storage medium and more particularly, to a moving picture reproducing apparatus in which player mode information indicating which data types can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus is set, a reproducing method using the same, and a storage medium.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Moving picture data recorded in a general storage medium includes compressed and coded moving picture information and navigation information for controlling reproduction of the moving picture information.<br>
The moving picture information includes an audio-visual stream that includes video, audio, and/or subtitles coded according to a moving picture experts group (MPEG) standard. Also, the moving picture information can include additional information, such as a coding attribute of the audio-visual stream, an entry point for random access, and a playlist, which is defined as an object determining a reproducing order.<br>
The navigation information includes navigation commands controlling reproduction of the moving picture information, such as a command for reproducing the playlist or a command for reproducing another playlist. The navigation information is generally stored in a binary code table. Accordingly, moving picture information can be reproduced with reference to navigation information of a storage medium, and a user can view a moving picture, such as a movie having a high-definition picture quality. A set of navigation commands is called a movie object.<br>
 However, a conventional storage medium in which moving pictures are recorded cannot provide additional functions, such as a program function providing a user-interactive function and a browsing function, except the reproducing function of moving picture information.<br>
    Also, even if a storage medium does provide functions other than the reproduction of moving picture information, a conventional reproducing apparatus having only a function for reproducing moving picture information cannot reproduce the storage medium including the additional functions. Therefore, compatibility between reproducing apparatuses and storage media is low.<br>
SUMMARY OF HE INVENTION<br>
   The invention provides a storage medium providing a program function and browsing function as additional functions besides reproduction of moving picture information.<br>
The invention also provides a reproducing apparatus that can smoothly reproduce information from the storage medium regardless of whether additional functions besides a function for reproducing moving picture information are provided, that is, regardless of a kind of reproducing apparatus.<br>
  The invention also provides a reproducing method, in which a storage medium can be smoothly reproduced regardless of the type of the storage medium or reproducing apparatus.<br>
  According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a reproducing apparatus including: a storage area in which player mode information indicating types of reproducible data is recorded; and a reproducing unit selectively reproducing first type data or first and second type data on the basis of the player mode information recorded in the storage area from a storage medium including at least one type data of the first type data for reproducing moving picture information and the second type data for providing additional functions using the moving picture information.<br>
  The player mode information can be recorded to indicate a first mode when the reproducing apparatus can only reproduce the first type data and indicate a second mode when the reproducing apparatus can reproduce the first type data and the second type data.<br>
The storage area can store a plurality of system parameters in which reproducing information set by the reproducing apparatus is recorded. The system parameters include the player mode information, and the player mode information cannot be reset after the reproduction starts.<br>
   The reproducing apparatus can further include a reading unit that reads at least one of the first type data and the second type data from a storage medium and reads system data for controlling reproduction of the data.<br>
 The reproducing apparatus can further include a buffering unit temporarily storing the read first type data or the first type data and the second type data, and the read system data. The reproducing unit can comprise an application manager controlling reproduction of the data on the basis of the system data and a blender generating an image by overlaying images reproduced from the first and second type data.<br>
 The reproducing unit can include a presentation engine decoding and reproducing compressed and coded moving picture information included in the first type data, and a navigation engine controlling the presentation engine on the basis of navigation information. The navigation information is included in the first type data, and is used for controlling reproduction of moving picture information. In this case, the player mode information indicates the first mode.<br>
 The reproducing unit can further include a program engine executing program data, which is included in the second type data, for providing a user-interactive function.  In this case, the player mode information indicates the second mode.<br>
 The reproducing unit can further include a browser engine executing browser data, which is included in the second type data, for reproducing relevant information from a markup document storing information related to a moving picture. Again, in this case, the player mode information indicates the second mode.<br>
  The application manager can transmit to the navigation engine location information of data to be initially reproduced included in the system data. The navigation engine can control the presentation engine so that the presentation engine reproduces the data to be initially reproduced and reads the player mode information from the storage area, and control the<br>
presentation engine such that the presentation engine reproduces reproducible first type data or first type data and second type data on the basis of the player mode information.<br>
   The data to be initially reproduced can be the first type data.<br>
    The application manager can control the engines such that the data to be initially reproduced is reproduced using the presentation engine and navigation engine. The succeeding data to be reproduced can be reproduced using the presentation engine and ravigation engine when the player mode information indicates the first mode and using the presentation engine, navigation engine, program engine, and browser engine when the player mode information indicates the second mode.<br>
   The storage medium can be a portable storage medium easily inserted into and taken out of the reproducing apparatus.<br>
  The storage medium can be an optical disc from which data can be read using an optical device.<br>
  According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a storage medium storing at least one of first type data for reproducing moving picture information and second type data for providing additional functions using the moving picture information, and player control information for controlling a reproducing unit so that the reproducing unit selectively reproduces reproducible first type data or first type data and second type data according to a reproducing apparatus.<br>
  The storage medium can also store system data for controlling reproduction of the first type data or the first type data and second type data.<br>
  The system data can include location information of data to be initially reproduced.<br>
   The data to be initially reproduced can be the first type data.<br>
  The data to be initially reproduced can include the player control information. The player control information is for controlling a reproducing apparatus so that player mode information is read from a storage area of the reproducing apparatus. When the read player mode information indicates a first mode, the first type data is reproduced, and when the read<br>
player mode information indicates a second mode, the first type data and the second type data are reproduced.<br>
   The first type data can include moving picture information, which is compressed and encoded, and navigation information for controlling reproduction of the moving picture nformation.<br>
  The second type data can include program data for providing a user-interactive iunction.<br>
  The second type data can further include browser data for reproducing relevant nformation from a markup document storing information related to moving pictures.<br>
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a reproducing method ncluding reading player mode information indicating types of reproducible data, and selectively eproducing first type data or first type data and second type data on the basis of the player node information read from a storage medium. The player mode information includes at least )ne of the first type data for reproducing moving picture information and the second type data or providing additional functions using the moving picture information.<br>
 The player mode information can be read from a storage area of a reproducing apparatus. When a type of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus is the irst type, the player mode information can be recorded to indicate a first mode, and when the ype of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus is the first type and the second type, the player mode information can be recorded to indicate a second mode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
    Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference<br>
numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
 According to an aspect of the invention, a first type data for reproducing a moving picture or the first type data and second type data for providing additional functions using the moving picture information is recorded in a storage medium. In particular, the storage medium includes player control information, that controls a reproducing apparatus so that the reproducing apparatus reproduces first type data when the reproducing apparatus is a first mode reproducing apparatus, and first type data and second type data when the reproducing apparatus is a second mode reproducing apparatus, according to player mode information indicating types of reproducible data. The player mode information is included in a predetermined storage area of the reproducing apparatus.<br>
  Also, a reproducing apparatus according to an aspect of the invention includes a predetermined storage area storing player mode information indicating data, that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus, as first type data and second type data; and a reproducing unit reproducing the first type data when the player mode information indicates a first mode and the first type data and the second type data when the player mode information indicates a second mode.<br>
    Accordingly, a storage medium providing a function for reproducing moving picture information and/or additional functions can be reproduced regardless of a type of reproducing apparatus used.<br>
  FIG. 1 illustrates first type data recorded in a storage medium according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a storage medium stores core data 1 and system data 3. The core data 1 is used for reproducing a moving picture (the core data is also called "first type data"). Each core data 1 is realized as an object. The core data 1 includes compressed and coded moving picture information 101 and navigation information 102 for controlling reproduction of the moving picture information 101. A set of the navigation commands is called a movie object. The moving picture information 101 can be reproduced with reference to the navigation information 102 stored in the storage medium, and a user can view a moving picture such as a movie having high-definition picture quality.<br>
   The system data 3 controls reproduction of the core data 1. The system data 3 includes at least startup information 105 and title information 106. The startup information 105 indicates a location of an object to be initially reproduced when the storage medium is reproduced by a reproducing apparatus. The title information 106 includes entry point information indicating a location of each object to be reproduced.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates first type data and second type data recorded in a storage medium according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 2, a storage medium stores core data 1, full data 2, and system data 3. The core data 1 is in FIG. 1. The full data 2 provides additional functions besides the reproduction of a moving picture (the full data is also called 'second type data"). The full data 2 may include browser data 203 for reproducing relevant information from a markup document storing information related to a moving picture, and/or program data 204 providing a user-interactive function.<br>
  The browser data 203 may include at least one object having commands for reproducing relevant information from a markup document storing information related to a moving picture. The commands may be realized with a markup language and/or an executing script language (for example, an ECMA script). Accordingly, relevant information may be reproduced from a markup document storing information related to moving pictures when the moving pictures are reproduced. For example, with respect to a movie recorded in the storage medium, relevant information, such as latest news related to actors/actresses stored in webpages or other files, news related to the movie, and updated subtitles, can be reproduced with the movie.<br>
 The program data 204 may include at least one object providing a function, such as a game function using a moving picture, a function for reproducing a director's commentary while reproducing a portion of the moving picture, a function for displaying additional information while reproducing a portion of the moving picture, or a function for chatting during reproducing a portion of the moving picture. In the program data 204, to execute a program with a moving picture, an application program interface (API) of a presentation engine for reproducing moving picture information, which will be described later, may be included. The full data 2 can also include another data type for providing another additional function besides production of a moving picture.<br>
   The system data 3 is used to control reproduction of the core data 1 and full data 2. The system data 3 includes startup information 205 and title information 206. The startup information 205 and title information 206 are not discussed here in detail because they are the same as discussed above in FIG. 1.<br>
   Accordingly, a storage medium in which the first type and second type data are recorded may provide various additional functions using a moving picture besides reproduction of the moving picture.<br>
  FIG. 3 illustrates the system data 3 of the first type data shown in FIG. 1.  Referring to FIG. 3, the system data 3 includes the startup information 105 and the title information 106. The system data 3 may further include menu information 307 for displaying a menu on a screen. The startup information 105 indicates a location of an object to be initially reproduced when a storage medium is reproduced by a reproducing apparatus. In FIG. 3, the startup information 105 points at a movie object (M-OB) 301 included in the core data 1. Accordingly, when the storage medium is inserted in the reproducing apparatus, the movie object (M-OB) 301 is initially reproduced. The startup information 105 is not limited to being directed to the movie object 301.<br>
 The title information 106 includes control information (title	1, title_2, title_3, ...) for<br>
reproducing at least one of movie objects (M-OB) 303, 304, 305	 The title information 106 of<br>
the storage medium in which first type core data 1 is recorded indicates a movie object having navigation commands for reproducing a moving picture. The title information 106 includes entry point information indicating a location of each object to be reproduced.<br>
   The movie objects 303 through 305 include of a plurality of navigation commands for reproducing moving pictures and may be binary tabulated. Each object has an identification number, and the identification number is identical to the entry point information indicated by the title information 106.<br>
   Also, a second movie object 303 through 305 can be reproduced when connected to a first movie object 303 through 305 that indicates a location of the second movie object 303 through 305. For example, the movie object (M-OB) 302 and also the movie objects (M-OBs) 303 through 305 can be reproduced when indicated by the movie object (M-OB) 301.<br>
    FIG. 4 illustrates the system data 3 of the first type data and second type data shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 4, the system data 3 is used to control reproduction of the core data 1 and full data 2. The system data 3 includes the startup information 205 and the title information 206. The system data 3 may further include menu information 407 for displaying a menu on a screen.<br>
 The startup information 205 indicates a location of an object to be initially reproduced when a storage medium is reproduced by a reproducing apparatus. In FIG. 4, the startup information 205 points at a movie object (M-OB) 401 included in the core data 1. Accordingly, when the storage medium is inserted in the reproducing apparatus, the movie object (M-OB) 401 is initially reproduced. It is understood that the startup information 205 can be directed to any movie object 401 included in the core data 1.<br>
The title information 206 includes entry point information indicating a location of each object to be reproduced. The title information 206 includes control information (title_1, title_2, title_3, ...) for reproducing at least one object. The objects indicated by the title information 206 may be classified into at least a first type core mode object 402 (hereinafter, a movie object), a second type program mode object 204 (hereinafter, a program object), and/or a browser mode object 203 (hereinafter, a webpage object).<br>
, The movie objects 401 and 402 include a plurality of navigation commands for reproducing moving pictures and may be binary tabulated.  Each movie object 401 and 402 has an identification number, and the identification number is identical to the entry point information indicated by the title information 206. The webpage object 203 includes a markup language script and/or an execution script, and a file name of a relevant markup document can be the entry point information. The program object 204 includes programs for providing a user-interactive function, and a file name of a relevant program can be the entry point information.<br>
   A second object can be reproduced when connected to a first object that indicates a location of the second object.<br>
As described above, the storage media may store core data for reproducing a moving picture and may further store program data and/or browser data as full data to provide additional functions using the moving picture. In particular, the storage medium storing the full data may<br>
provide various additional functions, such as a game using a moving picture, on-line chatting, displaying of information related to a webpage, etc.<br>
  A storage medium may be a portable storage medium that is easily inserted into and taken out of a reproducing apparatus and/or may be an optical disc from which data may be read using an optical device of the reproducing apparatus. For example, an optical disc, such as CD-ROM, a DVD, or a Blu-ray Disc, can be included in the storage medium, and an optical disc that will be developed later can also be included in the storage medium.<br>
  Hereinafter, a reproducing apparatus for reproducing from the storage medium described above will be described.<br>
    FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a reproducing apparatus according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the reproducing apparatus includes a reading unit 502, a buffering unit 503, a reproducing unit 504, and a system register 505 as a predetermined storage area.<br>
    The reading unit 502 reads data to be reproduced from a storage medium 501 as described above. For example, if the storage medium 501 is an optical disc, the reproducing apparatus includes an optical device that reads data recorded on the optical disc. The reading unit 502 reads first type core data or the first and the second type full data according to a type of the storage medium 501.<br>
  The buffering unit 503 temporarily stores the data read from the reading unit 502 and transmits the data to the reproducing unit 504. The reproducing unit 504 reproduces an object using a reproducing engine using a special reproducing function according to a data type on the basis of player mode information recorded in the system register 505. The reproduced object is displayed using a display apparatus (not shown). The system register 505 is a predetermined storage area in which the player mode information indicating types of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus is stored. The system register 505 will be described in detail later.<br>
    FIG. 6 is a detailed block diagram of a reproducing apparatus that can reproduce first type data (a first mode reproducing apparatus). Referring to FIG. 6, the buffering unit 503 temporarily stores data in a navigation data buffer 601, a moving picture data buffer 602, and a<br><br>
system data buffer 603 according to the types of data. The temporarily stored data is transmitted to a relevant reproducing engine according to player mode information of the system register 505.<br>
  The reproducing unit 504 includes at least reproducing engines 604 and 605 and an application manager 606. The reproducing engines 604 and 605 include a navigation engine 604 and a presentation engine 605. The navigation engine 604 receives navigation data from the navigation data buffer 601 and controls reproduction of moving picture stream data. The presentation engine 605 may be controlled to reproduce moving picture information using an API function having commands for reproducing a moving picture. The presentation engine 605 receives the moving picture stream data from the moving picture data buffer 602 and decodes and reproduces a compressed and coded moving picture.<br>
  The system register 505 includes player mode information indicating types of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus. Since the reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 6 can reproduce only core data for reproducing moving picture information (first type data), a first mode is recorded in the player mode information.<br>
   The navigation engine 604 reproduces an object to be initially reproduced and reads the player mode information from the system register 505. When the player mode information indicates the first mode, the navigation engine 604 reproduces a succeeding first type object through the navigation engine 604 and presentation engine 605.<br>
 The application manager 606 receives the system data 3 from the system data buffer 603 and controls the reproducing engines 604 and 605 to reproduce the moving picture information. That is, the application manager 606 seeks and reproduces an object that must be initially reproduced using the startup information 105 of the system data 3 when information stored in the storage medium is reproduced. Also, the application manager 606 seeks a location of an object to be reproduced with reference to the title information 106 of the system data 3 and reproduces the object to be reproduced.<br>
 Accordingly, even when a reproducing apparatus can reproduce only the first type data supporting only reproduction of a moving picture without an engine that can reproduce second type data providing additional functions, as shown in FIG. 6, the reproducing apparatus can smoothly reproduce only the first type data by setting the player mode information of the<br>
system register 505 as the first mode, even when a storage medium storing both first type and second type data is inserted. For example, even when a storage medium having additional functions is inserted into the reproducing apparatus, a moving picture can be smoothly reproduced without an error by reproducing only the information that the reproducing apparatus ran support.<br>
 FIG. 7 is a detailed block diagram of a reproducing apparatus that can reproduce first type and second type data (a second mode reproducing apparatus). Referring to FIG. 7, the buffering unit 503 temporarily stores data in a browser data buffer 701, a program data buffer 702, a navigation data buffer 703, a moving picture data buffer 704, and a system data buffer 705 according to the type of data. The temporarily stored data is transmitted to a relevant reproducing engine according to player mode information of the system register 505.<br>
 The reproducing unit 504 includes reproducing engines 706 through 709, an application manager 710 and a blender 711.<br>
 The reproducing engines 706 through 709 perform respective reproducing functions according to the type of the temporarily stored data. In detail, the reproducing engines 706 through 709 include at least a browser engine 706, a program engine 707, a navigation engine 708, and/or a presentation engine 709.<br>
  The browser engine 706 receives browser data 203 from the browser data buffer 701 and reproduces information related to moving picture information from a markup document. That is, the browser engine 706 executes a browsing command having a markup language script or an execution script included in the browser data 203.<br>
   The program engine 707 receives the program data 204 from the program data buffer 702 and provides a user-interactive function. That is, the program engine 707 executes a special program realizing a special function, such as a game, chatting, or a director's commentary. Accordingly, interactive actions with the user using a moving picture can be performed. Here, the browser engine 706 or the program engine 707 can provide additional functions for a moving picture by using API functions for the presentation engine 709.<br>
  The navigation engine 708 receives the navigation data 202 from the navigation data buffer 703 and controls reproduction of moving picture stream data. The navigation engine 708<br><br>
can also control reproduction of moving picture information by the presentation engine 709 using an API function that includes commands for reproducing a moving picture.<br>
  The presentation engine 709 receives the moving picture stream data 201 from the moving picture data buffer 704 and decodes and reproduces the compressed and coded moving picture.<br>
  The application manager 710 receives the system data 3 from the system data buffer 705 and controls the reproducing engines 706 through 709 when reproducing the moving picture information and providing the additional functions. That is, the application manager 710 seeks and reproduces an object that must be initially reproduced using the startup information 205 of the system data 3 when a storage medium is reproduced. Also, the application manager 710 seeks a location of an object to be reproduced with reference to the title information 206 of the system data 3 and reproduces the object using a relevant reproducing engine according to a data type.<br>
    The system register 505 is a predetermined storage area in which player mode information indicating types of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus is recorded. Since the reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 7 can reproduce both core data for reproducing moving picture information (fist type data) and full data (first type data and second type data), a second mode is recorded in the player mode information. A configuration of the system register 505 will be described in detail later.<br>
  The navigation engine 708 reproduces an object to be initially reproduced and reads the player mode information from the system register 505. When the player mode information indicates the second mode, the navigation engine 708 reproduces a succeeding first type object using the navigation engine 708 and the presentation engine 709 and reproduces a succeeding second type object using the browser engine 706 and the program engine 707.<br>
     The blender 711 outputs a single image by overlaying graphic pictures reproduced by the reproducing engines, i.e., the browser engine 706, the program engine 707, the navigation engine 708, and/or the presentation engine 709.<br>
    Accordingly, additional functions, such as a browsing function and a program function, can be realized when simultaneously reproducing a moving picture. That is, in the reproducing<br><br>
apparatus in which the system register 505 stores information indicating the second mode, first type moving picture data is decoded by the navigation engine 708 and the presentation engine 709, program data and/or browser data providing second type additional functions are decoded by the browser engine 706 and the program engine 707, and the decoded data is overlaid and displayed on a single screen by the blender 711. For example, when pictures including a cast profile are overlaid and reproduced or advertising pictures for a cell-phone used in the movie are overlaid when the first type moving picture data called "The Matrix" is reproduced, the moving picture and the additional functions can be simultaneously provided.<br>
 FIG. 8 is a table showing system parameters stored in the system register 505 of the reproducing apparatus of FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 8, the system register 505 is a predetermined storage area storing a plurality of parameters for recording information related to reproduction set by the reproducing apparatus. In FIG. 8, 64 system parameters numbered 0 through 63 are shown. Each system parameter has a fixed length of 32 bits and has a positive integer value. In the system parameters, various control information related to reproduction of a moving picture supported by the reproducing apparatus, such as an audio stream number, a playlist number, a navigation timer, menu language information, and subtitle language information, is recorded. Also, there are a plurality of reserved areas. In particular, the system parameter numbers 11 and 12 as shown, cannot be reset after reproduction starts.<br>
The system register 505 stores player mode information indicating types of data that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus. The player mode information is recorded in an Nth area among the reserved areas. The player mode information indicates the first mode when the reproducing apparatus supports only reproduction of the first type data and indicates the second mode when the reproducing apparatus supports reproduction of both the first type and second type data. That is, when the player mode information of the system register 505 is read, a data type that can be reproduced by the reproducing apparatus can be determined. In particular, the player mode information can be recorded in either the number 11 or 12 area, as shown, so that the player mode information cannot be reset.<br>
    The number of system parameters, a length of each parameter, and an order of the parameters stored in the system register 505 shown in FIG. 8 are only one embodiment of the invention and various changes in form and details can be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
  FIG. 9 illustrates the structure of a system parameter stored in the system register 505 of the reproducing apparatus of FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 9, player mode information is stored in a register having a 32-bit fixed length, and the least significant bit (LSB) bO (P-mode) of the player mode information is recorded as 0 or 1. The value 0 indicates that a reproducing apparatus is a first mode reproducing apparatus, and the reproducing apparatus can reproduce only first type moving picture information. The value 1 indicates that a reproducing apparatus is a second mode reproducing apparatus, and the reproducing apparatus can reproduce first type moving picture information and provide additional functions using a second type moving picture. A bit arrangement and the number of bits of the player mode information shown in FIG. 9 are just one embodiment and various changes in form and details can be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
    To increase compatibility between a storage medium and a reproducing apparatus, data to be initially reproduced can be the first type core data that can be reproduced in any kind of reproducing apparatus. Succeeding data can be selectively reproduced according to the player mode information. When the player mode information indicates the first mode, the data is reproduced using a presentation engine and navigation engine, and when the player mode information indicates the second mode, first type data is reproduced using the presentation engine and navigation engine and second type data is reproduced using a browser engine and a program engine.<br>
    FIG. 10 illustrates player control information recorded in a storage medium according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 10, player control information, with which any kind of reproducing apparatus can smoothly reproduce information stored in a storage medium including first type data or first type and second type data using system data 3, is shown.<br>
     In a navigation command of FIG. 10, player mode information (mode info) stored in a system register of a reproducing apparatus is read, and when the value of the player mode information is 0 (a core mode or a first mode), a first type movie object is called. When the value of the player mode information is 1 (a full mode or a second mode), the first type movie object and a second type program and/or a browser object are called. The designations relating to each of the player mode information types may be switched.<br>
   The navigation command is included as a portion of a movie object to be initially reproduced (the first type core data) indicated by startup information 105 or 205 of the system register 3. The object to be initially reproduced can be the first type movie object. Since both a first mode reproducing apparatus and a second mode reproducing apparatus can reproduce the first type movie object, when the object to be initially reproduced is the first type movie object, compatibility between a storage medium and a reproducing apparatus increases. That is, with reference to the player mode information, data can be smoothly reproduced regardless of the kind of data recorded in a storage medium and of the kind of data supported by a reproducing apparatus.<br>
   A method of reproducing moving picture data including mode information according to an aspect of the invention will be described on the basis of the configuration described above.<br>
  FIG. 11 is a block diagram for illustrating a reproducing method according to an aspect of the invention.  Referring to FIG. 11, a movie object 1102 to be initially reproduced is reproduced based on startup information 1101 included in system data 3, and player mode information of a system register 1103 of a reproducing apparatus is read to determine a succeeding object to be reproduced. For example, if the player mode information indicates a first mode, a movie object (first type data) is reproduced using a presentation engine and navigation engine, and when the player mode information indicates a second mode, a movie object (first type data) is reproduced using the presentation engine and navigation engine, and, simultaneously, a browser object and/or program object (second type data) are reproduced using a browser engine and/or program engine. A single image is obtained from the reproduced graphics using a blender and output via a display unit (not shown).<br>
     FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the reproducing method according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 12, to smoothly reproduce a moving picture regardless of a kind of storage medium or reproduce apparatus, system data is read from the storage medium in operation 1201, and a first type movie object to be initially reproduced is called with reference to startup information 105 or 205 included in the system data in operation 1202. To reproduce succeeding data, according to a navigation command (player control information) included in the called movie object, player mode information is read from a system register of a reproducing apparatus in operation 1203, and according to the read player mode information, when the player mode information indicates a first mode, core mode data (first type data) is reproduced,<br>
and when the player mode information indicates a second mode, full mode data (first type data and second type data) are reproduced in operation 1204.<br>
   The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable recording medium. The computer readable recording medium is any data storage device that can store data that can be thereafter read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable recording medium include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks, optical disks, and carrier waves (such as data transmission through the Internet). The computer readable recording medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.<br>
   As described above, according to aspects of the invention, a storage medium can provide additional functions, such as a program function for providing a user-interactive function and a browsing function for reproducing relevant information from a markup document, besides reproduction of moving picture information.<br>
Also, information in the storage medium can be smoothly reproduced using a reproducing apparatus regardless of whether the storage medium includes only first type data for reproduction of moving picture information or further includes second type data, providing additional functions, and furthermore, regardless of whether the reproducing apparatus can reproduce both the first type data and second type data.<br>
