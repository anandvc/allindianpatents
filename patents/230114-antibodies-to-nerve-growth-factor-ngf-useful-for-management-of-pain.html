CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the priority benefit of provisional patent applications<br>
U.S. Serial No. 60/436,905, filed December 24,2002; U.S. Serial No. 60/443,522, filed<br>
January 28,2003; and U.S. Serial No. 60/510,006, filed October 8,2003 all of which are<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention concerns anti-NGF antibodies (such as anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibodies). The invention further concerns use of such antibodies in the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of pain, including post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, and<br>
osteoarthritis pain.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR<br>
DEVELOPMEN<br>
[0003]	This invention was made with TU.S. Government support under Contract No.<br>
DAAD19-03-C-0006, awarded by DARPA. The U.S. Government may have certain rights<br>
in this invention.<br>
BACKGROUN D OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and<br>
its role in the development and survival of both peripheral and central neurons has been<br>
well characterized. NGF has been shown to be a critical survival and maintenance factor in<br>
the development of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and of basal<br>
forebrain cholinergic neurons. Smeyne et al, Nature 368:246-249 (1994) and Crowley et<br>
al., Cell 76:1001-1011 (1994). NGF up-regulates expression of neuropeptides in sensory<br>
neurons (Lindsay and Harmer, Nature 337:362-364 (1989)) and its activity is mediated<br>
through two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA receptor and the p75 common<br>
neurotrophin receptor (sometimes termed 'high affinity" and "low affinity" NGF receptors,<br>
respective). Chao et al., Science 232:518 -521 (1986). For review on NGF, see Huang et<br>
al., Anni. Rev. Nevrosci. 24:677-736 (2001): Bibel et al., Genes Dev. 14:2919-2937 (2000).<br><br>
The crystal structure of NGF and NGF in complex with the trkA receptor have been<br>
determined. See Nature 254:411 (1991); Nature 401:184-188 (1996).<br>
[0005]	Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and<br>
its role in the development and survival of both peripheral and central neurons has been<br>
well characterized. NGF has been shown to be a critical survival and maintenance factor in<br>
the developement of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and of basal<br>
forebrain cholinergic neurons (Smeyne, et al., Nature 368:246-249 (1994) and Crowley, et<br>
al., Cell 76:1001-1011 (1994)). NGF upregulates expression of neuropeptides in sensory<br>
neurons (Lindsay, et al., Nature 337:362-364 (1989)), and its activity is mediated through<br>
two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA tyrosine kinase receptor and the p75<br>
receptor which is structurally related to other members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor<br>
family (Chao, et al., Science 232:518-521 (1986)).<br>
[0006]	In addition to its effec s in the nervous system, NGF has been increasingly<br>
implicated in processes outside of the nervous system. For example, NGF has been shown<br>
to enhance vascular permeability (Otien, et al., Eur J Pharmacol. 106:199-201 (1984)),<br>
enhance T- and B-cell immune responses (Otten, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
86:10059-10063 (1989)), induce lymphocyte differentiation and mast cell proliferation and<br>
cause the release of soluble biological signals from mast cells (Matsuda, et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 85:6508-6512 (1988;; Pearce, et al., J. Physiol. 372:379-393 (1986);<br>
Bischoff, et al., Blood 79:2662-2669 (1992); Horigome, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14881-<br>
14887 (1993)). Although exogenousjy added NGF has been shown to be capable of having<br>
all of these effects, it is important to note that it has only rarely been shown that<br>
endogenous NGF is important in any of these processes in vivo (Torcia, et al., Cell.<br>
85(3):345-56 (1996)). Therefore, it is not clear what that effect might be, if any, of<br>
inhibiting the bioactivity of endogenous NGF.<br>
[0007]	NGF is produced by a number of cell types including mast cells (Leon, et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3739-3743 (1994)), B-lymphocytes (Torcia, et al., Cell<br>
85:345-356 (1996), keratinocytes (Di Marco, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:22838-22846)),<br>
smooth muscle cells (Ueyama, et al., /. Hypertens. 11:1061-1065 (1993)), fibroblasts<br>
(Lindholm, el&amp;.,Eur. J. Neurosci. 2 795-801 (1990)), bronchial epithelial cells (Kassel, et<br>
al., Clin, Exp. Allergy 31:1432-40 (2(01)), renal mesangial cells (Steiner, et al., Am. J.<br>
Physiol. 261 .F792-798 (1991)) and skeletal muscle myotubes (Schwartz, et al., J<br><br>
Photochem. Photobiol B66:195-200 (2002)). NGF receptors have been found on a variety<br>
of cell types outside of the nervous system. For example, TrkA has been found on human<br>
monocytes, T- and B-lymphocytes and mast cells.<br>
[0008]	An association between increased NGF levels and a variety of inflammatory<br>
conditions has been observed in hum an patients as well as in several animal models" These<br>
include systemic lupus erythematosus (Bracci-Laudiero, et al., Neuroreport 4:563-565<br>
(1993)), multiple sclerosis (Bracci-Laudiero, et al., Neurosci. Lett. 147:9-12 (1992)),<br>
psoriasis (Raychaudhuri, et al., Acta Derm. Penereol 78:84-86 (1998)), arthritis (Falcim, et<br>
al., Ann. Rheum. Dis. 55:745-748 (1996)), interstitital cystitis (Okragly, et al., J. Urology<br>
161:438-441 (1999)) and asthma (Braun, et al., Eur. J Immunol. 28:3240-3251 (1998)).<br>
[0009]	Consistently, an elevated level of NGF in peripheral tissues is associated<br>
with hyperalgesia and inflammation and has been observed in a number of forms of<br>
arthritis. The synovium of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis expresses high levels of<br>
NGF while in non-inflamed synovium NGF has been reported to be undetectable (Aloe, et<br>
al., Arch. Rheum. 35:351-355 (1992)) Similar results were seen in rats with<br>
experimentally induced rheumatoid arthritis (Aloe, et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 10:203-204<br>
(1992)). Elevated levels of NGF have been reported in transgenic arthritic mice along with<br>
an increase in the number of mast cells (Aloe, el al., Int. J. Tissue Reactions-Exp. Clin.<br>
Aspects 15:139-143 (1993)). PCT Publication No. WO 02/096458 discloses use of anti-<br>
NGF antibodies of certain properties in treating various NGF related disorders such as<br>
inflammatory condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). It has been reported that a purified<br>
anti-NGF antibody injected into arthritic transgenic mice carrying the human tumor<br>
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) gene caused reduction in the number of mast cells, as well as a<br>
decrease in histamine and substance P levels within the synovium of arthritis mice (Aloe et<br>
al.,Rheumatol.Int.14:249-252 (1995)). It has been shown that exogenous administration<br>
of a NGF antibody reduced the enhanced level of TNF-a occurring in arthritic mice (Manni<br>
et al.,Rheumatol. Int. 18:97-102 (1993)).<br>
[0010]	Also, increased expression of NGF and high affinity NGF receptor (TrkA)<br>
was observed in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes (lannone et al., Rheumatology 41:1413-<br>
1418(2002)).<br>
[0011]	Rodent anti-NGF antagonist antibodies have been reported. See, e.g.,<br>
Hongo et al, Hybridoma (200) 19(3):215-227; Ruberti et Al. (1993) Cell. Molec.<br><br>
Neurobiol. 13(5): 559-568. However, when rodent antibodies are used therapeutically in<br>
humans, a humar anti-murme antibody response develops in significant numbers of treated<br>
individuals. In addition, effector functions of mouse antibodies have proven to be less<br>
efficient in the human context Thus, there is a serious need for anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibodies, including humanized anti-NGF antagonist antibodies.<br><br>

in the presence of either 0.04 ng/ml of human NGF (approximately 1.5 pM; shown in lower<br>
panel) or 0.4 ng/ml human NGF (approximately 15 pM; shown in upper panel). Survival<br>
of E13.5 mouse trigeminal neurons in various concentrations of Fab E3; murine 911 Fab;<br>
and Fab H19-L129 and Fab 8L2-6D5 was assessed. The IC50 (in pM) was calculated for<br>

[0090]	FIGURE 9: is a graph showing the results of BIAcore analysis of the<br>
binding affinity to human NGF of mouse antibody 911 (Fab). Mouse antibody 911 bound<br>
NGF with a KD of 3.7 nM, koff of 8.4x10-5V-1 and k0n of 2.2x104Ms-1.<br>
[0091]	FIGURE 10: is a graph showing the results of BIAcore analysis of the<br>
binding affinity to human NGF of antibody E3 (Fab) (referred to as "3E Fab"). E3 bound<br>
human NGF with a KD of approximately 0.07 nM (and with a kon of about 6.0 x 105 M'V<br>
1, and a koff of about 4.2x10-5 s-1 )<br>
[0092]	FIGURE 11: is a graph depicting that antibody E3 blocks the interaction of<br>
NGF with its receptors, trkA ard p75, as assessed by percent binding detected between<br>
NGF and trkA (shown in black circles) and NGF and p75 (shown as hollow squares). The<br><br>
X axis corresponds to concentration of antibody 3E (Fab) and the Y axis corresponds to<br>
NGF binding (percent maximum RU). Increased concentrations of Fab E3 blocked the<br>
interaction of NGF with both p75 and trkA, as shown by decreased signal (measured in<br>
RU). When antibody E3 (Fab) concentration equaled NGF concentration, no NGF binding<br>
was observed (as shown by a signal of zero).<br>

antibody E3 and Fab E3. Survival of El3.5 mouse trigeminal neurons in the presence of<br>
human NGF and various concentrations of Fab E3 and antibody E3 was assessed. The X<br>
axis corresponds to NGF binding sites (nM) and the Y axis corresponds to normalized<br>
count of trigeminal (TG) neurons. Full antibody E3 and Fab 3E showed similar levels of<br>
inhibition of NGF-dependent survival of trigeminal neurons when the concentration of<br>
whole antibody and Fab were normalized to the number of NGF binding sites (Fab has one<br>
binding site and whole antibody has two binding sites).<br>

4, 0.8, 0.16, 0.032,0.0064, 0.00128, and 0.0 nM) of antibody E3 (solid triangles; referred<br>
to as "3E"), antibody 911 (solid cicles), and a trkA receptor immunoadhesin (shaded<br>
squares; referred as "trkA-Fc) to inhibit NGF-dependent survival of E13.5 trigeminal<br>
neurons in the presence of 0.4 ng/ml human NGF (saturating conditions). The X axis<br>
corresponds to concentration of artibody (nM) and the Y concentration corresponds to<br>
counted neurons. These results demonstrated that antibody E3 blocked NGF significantly<br>
better than either mouse monoclonal anti-NGF antibody 911 or the trkA immunoadhesin.<br>

Definitions<br>
[0110]	An "antibody" is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding<br>
to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc., through at least<br>
one antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin<br>
molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal<br>
antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (ScFv),<br><br>
mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified<br>
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site.<br>
An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class<br>
thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody<br>
amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be<br>
assigned to different classes. Then: are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD,<br>
IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes),<br>
e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2:. The heavy-chain constant domains that<br>
correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon,<br>
gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations<br>
of different classes of immunoglobalins are well known<br>
[0111]	"Fv" is an antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition<br>
and -binding site. In a two-chain F v species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy<br>
and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv<br>
species, one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a<br>
flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric<br>
structure analogous to that in a two -chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the<br>
three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding specificity on the<br>
surface of the VH-VL dimer. However, even a single variable domain (or half of a Fv<br>
comprising only 3 CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind<br>
antigen, although generally at a lover affinity than the entire binding site.<br>
[0112]	The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and<br>
the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab<br>
fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1<br>
domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge regions.<br>
[0113]	A "monoclonal antibody" refers to a homogeneous antibody population<br>
wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally occurring and<br>
non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen. A<br>
population of monoclonal antibodies is highly specific, being directed against a single<br>
antigenic site. The term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses not only intact monoclonal<br>
antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab,<br>
Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an<br><br>
antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule<br>
that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind<br>
to an antigen. It is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the<br>
manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression,<br>
transgenic animals, etc.).<br>
[0114]	As used herein, "human antibody" means an antibody having an amino acid<br>
sequence corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made<br>
using any of the techniques for mating human antibodies known in the art or disclosed<br>
herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one<br>
human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such<br>
example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain<br>
polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the<br>
art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that<br>
phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology,<br>
14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter,<br>
1991, J. Mol. Biol, 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol, 222:581). Human antibodies<br>
can also be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g.,<br>
mice in which the endogenous immnuioglobulin genes have been partially or completely<br>
inactivated. This approach is desc ibed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806;<br>
5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may<br>
be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed<br>
against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may<br>
have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer<br>
Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (l):86-95; and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,750,373.<br>
[0115]	"Chimeric antibodies" refers to those antibodies wherein one portion of each<br>
of the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains is homologous to corresponding<br>
sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular class,<br>
while the remaining segment of the chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in<br>
another. Typically, in these chimeric antibodies, the variable region of both light and heavy<br>
chains mimics the variable regions of antibodies derived from one species of mammals,<br>
while the constant portions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from<br><br>
another. One clear advantage to such chimeric forms is that, for example, the variable<br>
regions can conveniently be derived from presently known sources using readily available<br>
hybridomas or B cells from non human host organisms in combination with constant<br>
regions derived from, for example, human cell preparations. While the variable region has<br>
the advantage of ease of preparation, and the specificity is not affected by its source, the<br>
constant region being human, is less likely to elicit an immune response from a human<br>
subject when the antibodies are injected than would the constant region from a non-human<br>
source. However, the definition is not limited to this particular example.<br>
[0116]	A "functional Fc region" possesses at least one effector function of a native<br>
sequence Fc region. Exemplary "eifector functions" include Clq binding; complement<br>
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc roceptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated<br>
cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell<br>
receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector Junctions generally require the Fc region to be<br>
combined with a binding domain (e g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed<br>
using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.<br>
[0117]	A "native sequence I c region" comprises an amino acid sequence identical<br>
to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A "variant Fc region"<br>
comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region<br>
by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function<br>
of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino<br>
acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent<br>
polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from<br>
about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc<br>
region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at<br>
least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc<br>
region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity<br>
therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith.<br>
[0118]	As used herein "antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and<br>
"ADCC" refer to a cell-mediated retction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express<br>
Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize<br>
bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. ADCC<br>
activity of a molecule of interest can be assessed using an in vitro ADCC assay, such as<br><br>
that described in U.S. Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such<br>
assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Alternatively, or<br>
additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a<br>
animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., 1998, PNAS (USA), 95:652-656.<br>
[0119]	As used herein, "Fc receptor" and "FcR" describe a receptor that binds to the<br>
Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a<br>
preferred FcR is one which binds an lgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes<br>
receptors of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and<br>
alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcyRII receptors include FcyRII A (an<br>
"activating receptor") and FcγRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino<br>
acid sequences that differ primarily n the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed<br>
in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994,<br>
Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. "FcR"<br>
also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal<br>
IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976: J. Immunol, 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J.<br>
Immunol, 24:249).<br>
[0120]	"Complement depend ent cytotoxicity" and "CDC" refer to the lysing of a<br>
target in the presence of complemem. The complement activation pathway is initiated by<br>
the binding of the first component of the complement system (Clq) to a molecule (e.g. an<br>
antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC<br>
assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996),<br>
may be performed.<br>
[0121]	As used herein, the te ms "E3", "3E", and "antibody E3" are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to an antibody comprising the amino acid sequence of the heavy<br>
chain and light chain variable regions shown in Figures 1A (SEQ ID NO:l) and 1B (SEQ<br>
ID NO:2), respectively. The CDR portions of antibody E3 (including Chothia and Kabat<br>
CDRs) are diagrammatically depicted in Figures 1A and 1B. Figures 2 and 3 show<br>
polynucleotides encoding heavy and light chains, respectively, comprising the heavy and<br>
light chain variable regions shown in Figures 1A and 1B, respectively. The generation and<br>
characterization of E3 is described in the Examples. Different biological functions are<br>
associated with E3, including, but not limited to, ability to bind to NGF and inhibit NGF<br>
biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by NGF signaling; and ability<br><br>
to inhibit NGF-dependent survival of mouse E13.5 trigeminal neurons. As discussed<br>
herein, antibodies of the invention nay have any one or more of these characteristics. In<br>
some embodiments, the term "E3" refers to immunoglobulin encoded by (a) a<br>
polynucleotide encoding E3 light c lain that has a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4893<br>
or ATCC No. PTA-4894, and (b) a polynucleotide encoding E3 heavy chain that has a<br>
deposit number of ATCC No. PTA 4895.<br>
[0122]	As used herein, "immunospecific" binding of antibodies refers to the antigen<br>
specific binding interaction that ocours between the antigen-combining site of an antibody<br>
and the specific antigen recognized by that antibody (i.e., the antibody reacts with the<br>
protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and does not react detectably with unrelated<br>
proteins).<br>
[0123]	An epitope that "specifically binds", or "preferentially binds" (used<br>
interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art,<br>
and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the<br>
art. A molecule is said to exhibit "specific binding" or "preferential binding" if it reacts or<br>
associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity<br>
with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An<br>
antibody "specifically binds" or "preferentially binds" to a target if it binds with greater<br>
affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other<br>
substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to an NGF<br>
epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily,<br>
and/or with greater duration than it binds to other NGF epitopes or non-NGF epitopes. It is<br>
also understood by reading this defir ition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or<br>
epitope) that specifically or preferen ially binds to a first target may or may not specifically<br>
or preferentially bind to a second target As such, "specific binding" or "preferential<br>
binding" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding.<br>
Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.<br>
[0124]	The terms "polypeptide", "oligopeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer<br>
may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be<br>
interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has<br>
been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation,<br><br>
glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or<br>
modification, such as conjugation vith a labeling component. Also included within the<br>
definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid<br>
(including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known<br>
in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are based upon<br>
an antibody, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.<br>
[0125]	"Polynucleotide," or "nucleic acid," as used interchangeably herein, refer to<br>
polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be<br>
deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs,<br>
or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A<br>
polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and<br>
their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before<br>
or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-<br>
nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization,<br>
such as by conjugation with a labehng component. Other types of modifications include,<br>
for example, "caps", substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with<br>
an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged<br>
linkages (e.g., methyl phosphorates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, cabamates, etc.)<br>
and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those<br>
containing pendant moieties, such as for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins,<br>
antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine,<br>
psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative<br>
metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha<br>
anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s).<br>
Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for<br>
example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting<br>
groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be<br>
conjugated to solid supports. The f' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or<br>
substituted with amines or organic capping groups moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides<br>
can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known<br>
in the art, including, for example, 2'--O-methyl-, 2'-0-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose,<br><br>
carbocyclic sugar analogs, α-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses<br>
or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic<br>
nucleoside analogs such as methyl iboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be<br>
replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are<br>
not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(0)S("thioate"), P(S)S<br>
("dithioate"), "(0)NR2 ("amidate") P(0)R, P(O)OR, CO or CH2 ("formacetal"), in which<br>
each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally<br>
containing an ether (-O-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all<br>
linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all<br>
polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.<br>
[0126]	A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the<br>
antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in<br>
combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four<br>
framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs)<br>
also known as hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close<br>
proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation<br>
of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining<br>
CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al.<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of<br>
Health, Bethesda MD)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-<br>
antibody complexes (Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877; Al-lazikani et al (1997) J.<br>
Molec. Biol. 273:927-948)). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either<br>
approach or by a combination of both approaches.<br>
[0127]	A "constant region" c f an antibody refers to the constant region of the<br>
antibody light chain or the constant legion of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
[0128]	As used herein, the term "nerve growth factor" and "NGF" refers to nerve<br>
growth factor and variants thereof that retain at least part of the biological activity of NGF.<br>
As used herein, NGF includes all mammalian species of native sequence NGF, including<br>
human, canine, feline, equine, or bovine.<br><br>
[0129]	"NGF receptor" refers to a polypeptide that is bound by or activated by<br>
NGF. NGF receptors include the TrkA receptor and the p75 receptor of any mammalian<br>
species, including, but are not limited to, human, canine, feline, equine, primate, or bovine.<br>
[0130]	As used herein, an " anti-NGF antagonist antibody" (interchangeably termed<br>
"anti-NGF antibody") refers to an antibody which is able to bind to NGF and inhibit NGF<br>
biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by NGF signaling. An anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or<br>
reduce (including significantly) NGF biological activity, including downstream pathways<br>
mediated by NGF signaling, such as receptor binding and/or elicitation of a cellular<br>
response to NGF. For purpose of the present invention, it will be explicitly understood that<br>
the term "anti-NGF antagonist antibody" encompass all the previously identified terms,<br>
titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the NGF itself, an NGF biological<br>
activity (including but not limited to its ability to ability to mediate any aspect of post-<br>
surgical pain), or the consequences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified,<br>
decreased, or neutralized in any n eaningful degree. In some embodiments, an anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody binds NGF and prevent NGF dimerization and/or binding to an NGF<br>
receptor (such as p75 and/or trkA). In other embodiments, an anti-NGF antibody binds<br>
NGF and prevents trkA receptor dimerization and/or trkA autophosphorylation. Examples<br>
of anti-NGF antagonist antibodies are provided herein.<br>
[0131]	"Biological activit y' of NGF generally refers to the ability to bind NGF<br>
receptors and/or activate NGF receptor signaling pathways. Without limitation, a<br>
biological activity includes any one or more of the following: the ability to bind an NGF<br>
receptor (such as p75 and/or trkA); the ability to promote trkA receptor dimerization and/or<br>
autophosphorylation; the ability to activate an NGF receptor signaling pathway; the ability<br>
to promote cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, growth and other changes in cell<br>
physiology, including (in the case of neurons, including peripheral and central neuron)<br>
change in neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, neurotransmitter and/or<br>
neuropeptide release and regeneration following damage; the ability to promote survival of<br>
mouse El3.5 trigeminal neurons; and the ability to mediate pain, including post-surgical<br>
pain.<br><br>
[0132]	As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to material which is at least 50%<br>
pure (i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably at least 90 % pure, more preferably at<br>
least 95% pure, more preferably at least 98% pure, more preferably at least 99% pure.<br>
[10133]	A "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has<br>
been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include<br>
progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical<br>
(in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural,<br>
accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a<br>
polynucleotide(s) of this invention.<br>
[0134]	As used herein, "treatment" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or<br>
desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results<br>
include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: improvement or alleviation of<br>
any aspect of pain, including acute chronic, inflammatory, neuropathic, post-surgical pain,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis pain, or osteoarthritis pain. For purposes of this invention, beneficial<br>
or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:<br>
including lessening severity, alleviation of one or more symptoms associated with pain<br>
including any aspect of pain (such as shortening duration of pain, reduction of pain<br>
sensitivity or sensation).<br>
[0135]	An "effective amount" of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition<br>
is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results including clinical results such<br>
as alleviation or reduction in pain sensation. An effective amount can be administered in<br>
one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug,<br>
compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to treat, ameliorate,<br>
reduce the intensity of and/or prevent pain, including post-surgical pain, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis pain, and/or osteoarthritis pain. In some embodiments, the "effective amount" may<br>
reduce pain at rest (resting pain) or mechanically-induced pain (including pain following<br>
movement), or both, and it may be administered before, during or after an incision, cut, tear<br>
or injury and/or before, during or after painful stimulus. As is understood in the clinical<br>
context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or<br>
may not be achieved in conjunc ion with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical<br>
composition. Thus, an "effective amount" may be considered in the context of<br>
administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be<br><br>
given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable<br>
result may be or is achieved.<br>
[0136]	"Reducing incidence" of pain means any of reducing severity (which can<br>
include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies<br>
generally used for this conditions, including, for example, opiates), duration, and/or<br>
frequency (including, for example delaying or increasing time to post-surgical pain in an<br>
individual). As is understood by those skilled in the art, individuals may vary in terms of<br>
their response to treatment, and, as such, for example, a "method of reducing incidence of<br>
rheumatoid arthritis pain or osteoarthritis pain in an individual" reflects administering the<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody based on a reasonable expectation that such administration<br>
may likely cause such a reduction in incidence in that particular individual.<br>
[0137]	"Ameliorating" a pam or one or more symptoms of a pain (such as<br>
rheumatoid arthritis pain or osteoarthritis pain) means a lessening or improvement of one or<br>
more symptoms of a pain as compared to not administering an anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibody. "Ameliorating" also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a symptom.<br>
[0138]	"Palliating" a pain or one or more symptoms of a pain (such as rheumatoid<br>
arthritis pain or osteoarthritis pain) means lessening the extent of one or more undesirable<br>
clinical manifestations of post-surgical pain in an individual or population of individuals<br>
treated with an anti-NGF antagon ist antibody in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0139]	As used therein, "» lelaying" the development of pain means to defer, hinder,<br>
slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone progression of pain, such as post-surgical pain,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis pain, or osteoarthritis pain. This delay can be of varying lengths of<br>
time, depending on the history oi the disease and/or individuals being treated. As is<br>
evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass<br>
prevention, in that the individual does not develop pain. A method that "delays"<br>
development of the symptom is a method that reduces probability of developing the<br>
symptom in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the symptoms in a given time<br>
frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on<br>
clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects.<br>
[0140]	"Pain" as used he ein refers to pain of any etiology, including acute and<br>
chronic pain, and any pain with an inflammatory component. Examples of pain include<br>
post-surgical pain, post-operative pain (including dental pain), migraine, headache and<br><br>
trigeminal neuralgia, pain associated with burn, wound or kidney stone, pain associated<br>
with trauma (including traumatic head injury), neuropathic pain, pain associated with<br>
musculo-skeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing<br>
spondylitis, sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism and<br>
peri-articular disorders, and pain associated with cancer (including "break-through pain"<br>
and pain associated with terminal cancer), peripheral neuropathy and post-herpetic<br>
neuralgia. Examples of pain with an inflammatory component (in addition to some of<br>
those described above) include rheumatic pain, pain associated with mucositis, and<br>
dysmenorrhea.<br>
[0141]	"Post-surgical pain' (interchangeably termed "post-incisional" or "post-<br>
traumatic pain") refers to pain aris ng or resulting from an external trauma such as a cut,<br>
puncture, incision, tear, or wound nto tissue of an individual (including that that arises<br>
from all surgical procedures, whether invasive or non-invasive). As used herein, post-<br>
surgical pain does not include pain that occurs (arises or originates) without an external<br>
physical trauma. In some embodiments, post-surgical pain is internal or external (including<br>
peripheral) pain, and the wound, out, trauma, tear or incision may occur accidentally (as<br>
with a traumatic wound) or deliberately (as with a surgical incision). As used herein,<br>
"pain" includes nociception and the sensation of pain, and pain can be assessed objectively<br>
and subjectively, using pain score s and other methods well-known in the art. Post-surgical<br>
pain, as used herein, includes allodynia (i.e., increased response to a normally non-noxious<br>
stimulus) and hyperalgesia (i.e., increased response to a normally noxious or unpleasant<br>
stimulus), which can in turn, be thermal or mechanical (tactile) in nature. In some<br>
embodiments, the pain is characterized by thermal sensitivity, mechanical sensitivity and/or<br>
resting pain. In some embodiments, the post-surgical pain comprises mechanically-induced<br>
pain or resting pain. In other embodiments, the post-surgical pain comprises resting pain.<br>
The pain can be primary or secondary pain, as is well-known in the art.<br>
[0142]	A "biological sample" encompasses a variety of sample types obtained from<br>
an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. The definition<br>
encompasses blood and other liquid samples of biological origin, solid tissue samples such<br>

sequence that directs transcription of a nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can<br>
be a promoter, such as a constitu ive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The<br>
expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be<br>
transcribed.<br>
[0146]	As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any material<br>
which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological<br>
activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are<br>
not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered<br>
saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting<br>
agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered<br>
saline or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by<br>
well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990; and<br>

METHODS OF USE<br>
E3 Compositions, E3 Derived Compositions, and Methods of Making the Compositions<br>
[0149]	This invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, comprising an E3 antibody or polypeptide; and polynucleotides comprising<br>
sequences encoding an E3 antibody or polypeptide. As used herein, compositions comprise<br>
one or more antibodies or polypeptides (which may or may not be an antibody) that bind to<br>
NGF, and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more<br>
antibodies or polypeptides that bind to NGF. These compositions may further comprise<br>
suitable excipients, such as pharrr aceutically acceptable excipients including buffers,<br>
which are well known in the art.<br>
[0150]	The invention also encompasses isolated antibody, polypeptide and<br>
polynucleotide embodiments. The invention also encompasses substantially pure antibody,<br>
polypeptide and polynucleotide embodiments.<br>
[0151]	The antibodies and polypeptides of the invention are characterized by any<br>
(one or more) of the following characteristics: (a) ability to bind to NGF; (b) ability to<br>
reduce and/or inhibit NGF biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by<br>
NGF signaling; (c) ability to reduce and/or inhibit NGF-dependent survival of mouse E13.5<br>
trigeminal neurons; (d) absence of any significant cross-reactivity to NT3, NT4/5, and/or<br>
BDNF; (e) ability to treat and/or prevent pain (including post-surgical pain); (f) ability to<br>
increase clearance of NGF; (g) ability to reduce or inhibit activation of trkA receptor, as<br>
detected, for example, using kinase receptor activation assay (KIRA) (see U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,027,927).<br>
[0152]	The binding properties of antibody E3, which binds human NGF with high<br>
affinity and slow dissociation kinetics, compared with parent murine anti-NGF monoclonal<br>
antibody 911, are summarized below. E3 binds human NGF with an approximately 50-fold<br>
higher binding affinity than pare at mouse antibody 911.<br><br><br><br>
[0153]	The E3 antibody and related antibodies also exhibit a strong capacity to<br>
antagonize human NGF, as assessed by in vitro assays (see Examples 2 and 3). For<br>
example, antibody E3 antagonizes the NGF-dependent survival of mouse El3 trigeminal<br>
neurons at an IC50 of about 21 pM in the presence of 15 pM of human NGF, and about 1.2<br>
pM in the presence of 1.5 pM of human NGF.<br>
[0154]	Accordingly, in another aspect, the antibodies and polypeptides of the<br>
invention are further identified and characterized by: (h) high affinity binding to human<br>
NGF with low dissociation kinetics (in some embodiments, with a KD of less than about 2<br>
nM, and/or a koff of slower than about 6x10-5 s-1) and/or (i) ability to inhibit (block)<br>
NGF-dependent survival of mouse E13.5 trigeminal neurons with an IC50 of about 100 pM<br>
or less at about 15 pM of NGF (in some embodiments, human NGF) and/or an IC50 of<br>
about 20 pM or less at about 1.5 pM of NGF.<br>
[0155]	In some embodiments, the antibody binds human NGF, and does not<br>
significantly bind an NGF from another vertebrate species (in some embodiment,<br>
mammalian). In some embodiments, the antibody binds human NGF as well as one or<br>
more NGF from another vertebrate species (in some embodiments, mammalian). In still<br>
other embodiments, the antibody binds NGF and does not significantly cross-react with<br>
other neurotrophins (such as the related neurotrophins, NT3, NT4/5, and/or BDNF). In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody binds NGF as well as at least one other neurotrophin. In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody binds to a mammalian species of NGF, such as horse or<br>
dog, but does not significantly bind to NGF from anther mammalian species.<br>
[0156]	In some embodir rents, the invention is an antibody comprising a light chain<br>
that is encoded by a polynucleotide that is produced by a host cell with a deposit number of<br>
ATCC No. PTA-4893 or ATCC No. PTA-4894. In another aspect, the invention is an<br>
antibody comprising a heavy chain that is encoded by a polynucleotide that is produced by<br>
a host cell with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4895. The present invention also<br>
encompasses various formulations of E3 and equivalent antibody fragments (e.g., Fab,<br><br>
Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fc, etc.), single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising<br>
an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of E3 that comprises an antigen<br>
(NGF) recognition site of the required specificity. The equivalent antibodies of E3,<br>
including antibody and polypeptide fragments (which may or may not be antibodies) of E3,<br>
and polypeptides comprising polypeptide fragments of E3 are identified and characterized<br>
by any (one or more) of the criteria described above.<br>
[0157]	Accordingly, the invention provides any of the following, or compositions<br>
(including pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any of the following: (a) antibody E3;<br>
(b) a fragment or a region of the antibody E3; (c) a light chain of the antibody E3 as shown<br>
in Figures 1B; (c) a heavy chain of the antibody E3 as shown in Figures 1 A; (d) one or<br>
more variable region(s) from a lignt chain and/or a heavy chain of the antibody E3; (e) one<br>
or more CDR(s) (one, two, three, tour, five or six CDRs) of antibody E3 shown in Figures<br>
1A and 1B; (f) CDR H3 from the heavy chain of antibody E3 shown in figure 1 A; (g)<br>
CDR L3 from the light chain of antibody E3 shown in Figure 1B; (h) three CDRs from the<br>
light chain of antibody E3 shown in Figure 1B; (i) three CDRs from the heavy chain of<br>
antibody E3 shown in Figure 1 A; (j) three CDRs from the light chain and three CDRs from<br>
the heavy chain, of antibody E3 snown in Figures 1A and 1B; and (k) an antibody<br>
comprising any one of (b) through (j). As is evident from the description herein,<br>
specifically excluded from the invention are polypeptide embodiments consisting of the<br>
identical amino acid sequence to an amino acid sequence of mouse monoclonal antibody,<br>
911. The extended CDR sequences of Mab 911 are shown in Figures 1A and 1B, and in<br>
SEQ ID NOS:9-14.<br>
[0158]	The CDR portions of antibody E3 (including Chothia and Kabat CDRs) are<br>
diagrammatically depicted in Figures 1A and 1B, and consist of the following amino acid<br>
sequences: (a) heavy chain CDR 1 ("CDR H1") GFSLIGYDLN (SEQ ID NO:3); (b) heavy<br>
chain CDR 2 ("CDR H2") IIWGDTTDYNSAVKS (SEQ ID NO:4); (c) heavy chain CDR<br>
3 ("CDR H3") GGYWYATSYYFDY (SEQ ID NO:5); (d) light chain CDR 1 ("CDR L1")<br>
RASQSISNNLN (SEQ ID NO:6); (e) light chain CDR 2 ("CDR L2") YTSRFHS (SEQ ID<br>
NO:7); and (f) light chain CDR3 ("CDR L3") QQEHTLPYT (SEQ ID NO:8).<br>
Determination of CDR regions is well within the skill of the art. It is understood that in<br>
some embodiments, CDRs can be a combination of the Kabat and Chothia CDR (also<br><br>
termed "combined CDRs" or "extended CDRs"). In some embodiments, the CDRs<br>
comprise the Kabat CDR. In other embodiments, the CDRs are the Chothia CDR.<br>
[0159]	In some embodiments, the invention provides an antibody which comprises<br>
at least one CDR that is substantially homologous to at least one CDR, at least two, at least<br>
three, at least four, at least 5 CDRs of E3 (or, in some embodiments substantially<br>
homologous to all 6 CDRs of E3, or derived from E3). Other embodiments include<br>
antibodies which have at least two, three, four, five, or six CDR(s) that are substantially<br>
homologous to at least two, three, four, five or six CDRs of E3 or derived from E3. It is<br>
understood that, for purposes of this invention, binding specificity and/or overall activity<br>
(which may be in terms of treating and/or preventing pain or inhibiting NGF-dependent<br>
survival of E13.5 mouse trigeminal neurons) is generally retained, although the extent of<br>
activity may vary compared to E3 (may be greater or lesser).<br>
[0160]	The invention also provides a polypeptide (which may or may not be an<br>
antibody) which comprises an amino acid sequence of E3 (shown in Figures 1A and 1B)<br>
that has any of the following: at least 5 contiguous amino acids, at least 8 contiguous amino<br>
acids, at least about 10 contiguous amino acids, at least about 15 contiguous amino acids, at<br>
least about 20 contiguous amino acids, at least about 25 contiguous amino acids, at least<br>
about 30 contiguous amino acids of a sequence of E3, wherein at least 3 of the amino acids<br>
are from a variable region of E3, with the understanding that embodiments that consist of<br>
the identical amino acid sequence to an amino acid sequence of mouse monoclonal<br>
antibody, 911, are specifically excluded. The extended CDR sequences of Mab 911 are<br>
shown in Figures 1A and 1B, and in SEQ 1D NOS:9-14. In one embodiment, the variable<br>
region is from a light chain of E3 In another embodiment, the variable region is from a<br>
heavy chain of E3. In another embodiment, the 5 (or more) contiguous amino acids are<br>
from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of E3 shown in Figures 1A and 1B.<br>
[0161]	In another embodiment, the invention provides a polypeptide which<br>
comprises an amino acid sequence of E3 that has any of the following: at least 5 contiguous<br>
amino acids, at least 8 contiguous amino acids, at least about 10 contiguous amino acids, at<br>
least about 15 contiguous amino acids, at least about 20 contiguous amino acids, at least<br>
about 25 contiguous amino acids, at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of a sequence of<br>
E3, wherein the E3 sequence comprises any one or more of: amino acid residue L29 of<br>
CDRH1,150 of CDRH2, W101 of CDRH3, and/or A103 of CDRH3; and/or amino acid<br><br>
residue S28 of CDRL1.N32 of CERL1, T51 of CDRL2,91E of CDRL3 and/or H92 of<br>
CDRL3, with the understanding thAt embodiments that consist of the identical amino acid<br>
sequence to an amino acid sequenc e of mouse monoclonal antibody, 911, are specifically<br>
excluded.<br>
[0162]	As is evident, throughout this disclosure, a sequential amino acid numbering<br>
scheme is used to refer to amino acid residues in the variable regions (that is, the amino<br>
acid residues in each variable region are numbered in sequence). As is well known in the<br>
art, the Kabat and/or Chothia numbering systems are useful when comparing two<br>
antibodies or polypeptides, such as an E3 antibody and an E3 variant (or polypeptide<br>
suspected of being an E3 variant). It is well understood in the art how to convert sequential<br>
numbering to Chothia and/or Kab it numbering, if desired, for example, for use in making<br>
comparisons between E3 and anoher polypeptide. Figure 23 depicts the E3 variable<br>
regions numbered using sequential. Chothia and Kabat numbering. In addition, to facilitate<br>
comparison, generally it is understood that framework residues generally, but not always,<br>
have approximately the same number of residues. However, the CDRs may vary in size<br>
(i.e., it is possible to have insertions and/or (deletions of one or more amino acid residues).<br>
When comparing an E3 antibody and a candidate E3 variant (for example, in the case of a<br>
CDR region from a candidate sequence which is longer in the sequence in antibody E3 to<br>
which is is aligned), one may follow the following steps (though other methods are known<br>
in the art). The candidate antibody sequence is aligned with E3 antibody heavy chain and<br>
light chain variable regions. Alignment may be done by hand, or by computer using<br>
commonly accepted computer programs. Alignment may be facilitated by using some<br>
amino acid residues which are common to most Fab sequences. For example, the light and<br>
heavy chains each typically have two cysteines, which are often found at a conserved<br>
position. It is understood tht the amino acid sequence of a candidate variant antibody may<br>
be longer (i.e. have inserted amir aci residues) or shorter (have deleted amino acid<br>
residues). Suffixes may be added to the residue number to indicate the insertion of<br>
additional residues, e.g., residue 34 abc. For candidate sequences which, for example, align<br>
with a E3 sequence for, e.g., residues 33 and 35, but have no residue between them to align<br>
with residue 35, the residue 35 is simply not assigned to a residue. In another approach, it<br>
is generally well known that comparison may be made between structural equivalent (e.g.,<br>
same position in the antigen-antibody complex) amino acids when comparing CDRs of<br><br>
different lengths. For example, tht; Chothia numbering (Al-Lazikani et al, supra) generally<br>
(but not in all cases), places insertions and deletions at the structurally corresct positions.<br>
Structural equivalence may also be deduced or demonstrated using X-ray crystallography<br>
or double mutant cycle analysis (see Pons et al. (1999) Prot. Sci. 8:958-968).<br>
[0163]	The binding affinity of an anti-NGF antibody to NGF (such as hNGF) can<br>
be about 0.10 to about 0.80 nM, about 0.15 to about 0.75 nM and about 0.18 to about 0.72<br>
nM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is about 2 pM, about 5 pM, about 10 pM,<br>
about 15 pM, about 20 pM, about 40 pM, or greater than about 40 pM. In one<br>
embodiment, the binding affinity is between about 2 pM and 22 pM. In other<br>
embodiments, the binding affinity is less than about 10 nM, about 5 nM, about 4 nnM,<br>

[0164]	The binding affinity of the antibody to NGF can be determined using<br>
methods well known in the art. One way of determining binding affinity of antibodies to<br><br>
NGF is by measuring affinity of monofunctional Fab fragments of the antibody, as<br>
described in the Examples. To obtain monofunctional Fab fragments, an antibody (for<br>
example, IgG) can be cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity of an<br>
anti-NGF Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by surface plasmon resonance<br>
(BlAcore3000™ surface plasmon esonance (SPR) system, BIAcore, INC, Piscaway NJ),<br>
as described in the Examples. This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding<br>
affinity of an antibody to NGF of any species, including human NGF, NGF of another<br>
vertebrate (in some embodiments, mammalian) (such as mouse NGF, rat NGF, primate<br>
NGF), as well as for use with other neurotrophins, such as the related neurotrophins NT3,<br>
NT4/5, and/or BDNF.<br>
[0165]	In some embodiments, the antibodies or peptides of the invention may<br>
inhibit (reduce, and/or block) human NGF-dependent survival of mouse E13.5 trigeminal<br>
neurons with an IC50 (in the presence of about 15 pM of NGF) of about any of 200 pM,<br>
150 pM, 100 pM, 80 pM, 60 pM, 40 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, or less. In some embodiments,<br>
the antibodies or peptides of the invention may inhibit (reduce, and/or block) human NGF-<br>
dependent survival of mouse El35 trigeminal neurons with an IC50 (in the presence of<br>
about 1.5 pM of NGF) of about any of 50 pM, 40 pM, 30 pM, 10 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5<br>
pM; 2 pM, 1 pM, or less. In some embodiments, the antibodies or peptides of the invention<br>
may inhibit (reduce, and/or block) rat NGF-dependent survival of mouse El3.5 trigeminal<br>
neurons with an IC50 (in the presence of about 15 pM of NGF) of about any of 150 pM,<br>
125 pM, 100 pM, 80 pM, 60 pM, 40 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5 pM, or less. In some<br>
embodiments, the antibodies or peptides of the invention may inhibit (reduce, and/or block)<br>
rat NGF-dependent survival of mouse El3.5 trigeminal neurons with an IC50 (in the<br>
presence of about 1.5 pM of NGF) of about any of 30 pM, 25 pM, 20 pM, 15 pM, 10 pM, 5<br>
pM, 4 pM, 3 pM, 2 pM, 1 pM, or less. Methods for measurement of the NGF-dependent<br>
survival of mouse El3 trigeminal neurons are known in the art, and described, e.g., in<br>
Example 2.<br>
[0166]	The invention also provides methods of making any of these antibodies or<br>
polypeptides. The antibodies of this invention can be made by procedures known in the art,<br>
some of which are illustrated in the Examples. The polypeptides can be produced by<br>
proteolytic or other degradation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (i.e., single or<br>
fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical synthesis. Polypeptides of the<br><br>
antibodies, especially shorter polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently<br>
made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis are known in the art and are<br>
commercially available. For example, a E3 antibody could be produced by an automated<br>
polypeptide synthesizer employing the solid phase method. See also, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 6,331,4 .5. Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared<br>
in vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving<br>
cross-linking agents. For example, Immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide<br>
exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this<br>
purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.<br>
[0167]	In another alternati ve, the antibodies can be made recombinantly using<br>
procedures that are well known ir the art. In one embodiment, a polynucleotide comprising<br>
a sequence encoding the variable and light chain regions of antibody E3 (shown in Figures<br>
1A and IB) is cloned into a vector for expression or propagation in a host cell (e.g., CHO<br>
cells). In another embodiment, the polynucleotide sequences shown in Figures 2 and 3 are<br>
cloned into one or more vectors for expression or propagation. The sequence encoding the<br>
antibody of interest may be maintained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then<br>
be expanded and frozen for future use. Vectors (including expression vectors) and host<br>
cells are further described herein. Methods for expressing antibodies recombinantly in<br>
plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for example, Peeters et al. (2001) Vaccine<br>
19:2756; Lonberg, N. and D. Hnszar (1995) Int.Rev.Immunol 13:65; and Pollock et al.<br>
(1999) J Immunol Methods 231 147. Methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g.,<br>
humanized, single chain, etc. are known in the art.<br>
[0168]	The invention also encompasses single chain variable region fragments<br>
("scFv") of antibodies of this invention, such as E3. Single chain variable region fragments<br>
are made by linking light and/or heavy chain variable regions by using a short linking<br>
peptide. Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426. An example of a linking peptide is<br>
(GGGGS)3 (SEQ ID NO:l5), which bridges approximately 3.5 nm between the carboxy<br>
terminus of one variable region and the amino terminus of the other variable region.<br>
Linkers of other sequences have been designed and used (Bird et al. (1988). Linkers can<br>
in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attachment of drugs or attachment to<br>
solid supports. The single chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or<br>
synthetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated synthesizer can be used. For<br><br>
recombinant production of scFv, a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes<br>
the scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukaryotic, such as yeast, plant,<br>
insect or mammalian cells, or profoiryotic, such as E. coli. Polynucleotides encoding the<br>
scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as ligation of polynucleotides.<br>
The resultant scFv can be isolated using standard protein purification techniques known in<br>
the art.<br>
[01691	Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also<br>
encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains<br>
are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for<br>
pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair<br>
with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see<br>
e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc Natl. Acad Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al.<br>
(1994) Structure 2:1121-1123).<br>
[0170]	The antibody may be a bispecific antibody, a monoclonal antibody that has<br>
binding specificities for at least two different antigens. A bisecific antibody can be<br>
prepared using the antibodies disclosed herein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies<br>
are known in the art (see, e.g., Stresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210).<br>
Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies was based on the<br>
coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, with the two heavy<br>
chains having different specificities (Millstein and Cuello, 1983, Nature 305, 537-539).<br>
[0171]	According to one approach to making bispecific antibodies, antibody<br>
variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites)<br>
are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2<br>
and CH3 regions. It is preferrec to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1),<br>
containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions.<br>
DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the<br>
immunoglobulin light chain, arc inserted into separate expression vectors, and are<br>
cotransfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting<br>
the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal<br>
ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields.<br>
It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide<br><br>
chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in<br>
equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.<br>
[0172]	In one approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in<br>
the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with an immunoglobulin light chain in only one<br>
half of the bispecific molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound<br>
from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations. This approach is described in PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 94/04690, published March 3,1994.<br>
[0173]	Heteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two covalently joined antibodies,<br>
are also within the scope of the irvention. Such antibodies have been used to target<br>
immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of<br>
HIV infection (PCT application publication Nos. WO 91/00360 and WO 92/200373; EP<br>
03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking<br>
methods. Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are well known in the art, and are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980.<br>
[0174]	The antibody may be a humanized antibody, for example, as known in the<br>
art, and as described herein.<br>
[0175]	Antibodies may be modified as described in PCT Publication No. WO<br>
99/58572, published November 18,1999. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a<br>
binding domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an amino acid<br>
sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a constant domain of a human<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target molecule<br>
without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of<br>
the target. Preferably, the effector domain is capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or<br>
FcγRIIb. These are typically based on chimeric domains derived from two or more human<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain CH2 domains. Antibodies modified in this manner are<br>
preferred for use in chronic anibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse<br>
reactions to conventional antibody therapy.<br>
[0176]	The invention encompasses modifications to antibody E3, including<br>
functionally equivalent antibodies which do not significantly affect their properties and<br>
variants which have enhanced or decreased activity. Modification of polypeptides is<br><br>
routine practice in the art and is further exemplified in the Examples. Examples of<br>
modified polypeptides include polypeptides with substitutions (including conservative<br>
substitutions) of amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids<br>
which do not significantly deleteriously change the functional activity, or use of chemical<br>
analogs.<br>
[0177]	A polypeptide "variant," as used herein, is a polypeptide that differs from a<br>
native protein in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions and/or insertions, such that<br>
the immunoreactivity of the polypep ide is not substantially diminished. In other words,<br>
the ability of a variant to specifically bind antigen may be enhanced or unchanged, relative<br>
to the native protein, or may be diminished by Hess than 50%, and preferably less than 20%,<br>
relative to the native protein. Polype ptide variants preferably exhibit at least about 80%,<br>
more preferably at least about 90% and most preferably at least about 95% identity<br>
(determined as described herein) to the identified polypeptides.<br>
[0178]	Amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies may be prepared by<br>
introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis.<br>
Such variants include, for example, c eletions from, and/or insertions into and/or<br>
substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:l or 2 described<br>
herein. Any combination of deletion, insertion., and substitution is made to arrive at the<br>
final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The<br>
amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as<br>
changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.<br>
[0179]	A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the<br>
antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis or modification is called "alanine<br>
scanning mutagenesis," and is described by Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science,<br>
244:1081-1085. A residue or group of target residues is identified (e.g., charged residues<br>
such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino<br>
acid (most preferably alanine or poly alanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids<br>
with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the<br>
substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of<br>
substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is<br>
predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example,<br>
to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random<br><br>
mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants<br>
are screened for the desired activity. Library scanning mutagenesis, as described herein,<br>
may also be used to identify locations in an antibody that are suitable for mutagenesis or<br>
modification.<br>
[0180]	Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal<br>
fusions ranging in length from one tsidue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more<br>
residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues.<br>
Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue<br>
or the antibody fused to an epitope [ag. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule<br>
include the fusion to the N- or C-te minus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide<br>
which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.<br>
[0181]	Substitution variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody<br>
molecule removed and a different tesidue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest<br>
for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also<br>
contemplated. Conservative subst tutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of<br>
"conservative substitutions". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity,<br>
then more substantial changes, denominated "exemplary substitutions" in Table 1, or as<br>
further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the<br>
products screened.<br><br><br><br>
[0182]	Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are<br>
accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on<br>
maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for<br>
example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the<br>
molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues<br>
are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:<br>
(1)	Hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala. Val, Leu, IIe;<br>
(2)	Neutral hydrophilic: CyS, Ser, Thr;<br>
(3)	Acidic: Asp, Glu;<br>
(4)	Basic: Asn, GIn, His, L&gt;s, Arg;<br>
(5)	Residues that influence Chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and<br>
(6)	Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe<br>
[0183]	Non-conservative substitutions; are made by exchanging a member of one of<br>
these classes for another class.<br>
[0184]	Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of<br>
the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative<br><br>
stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s)<br>
may be added to the antibody to improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an<br>
antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment.<br>
[0185]	Amino acid modifications can range from changing or modifying one or<br>
more amino acids to complete redesign of a region, such as the variable region. Changes in<br>
the variable region can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. In some embodiment, no<br>
more than one to five conservative amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR<br>
domain. In other embodiments, no more than one to three conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions are made within a CDR3 domain. In still other embodiments, the CDR<br>
domain is CDRH3 and/or CDR L3.<br>
[0186]	Modifications also include glycosylated and nonglycosylated polypeptides,<br>
as well as polypeptides with other post-translational modifications, such as, for example,<br>
glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Antibodies are<br>
glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997,<br>
Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 15:26-32). The<br>
oligosaccharide side chains of the in munoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et<br>
al., 1996, Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1818; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem. 29:4175-<br>
4180) and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein, which can<br>
affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein<br>
(Hefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416).<br>
Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based<br>
upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to<br>
affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with<br>
tetracycline-regulated expression of β(l,4)-N-acetyl glucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a<br>
glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have<br>
improved ADCC activity (Umana et al, 1999, Mature Biotech. 17:176-180).<br>
[0187]	Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-<br>
linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an<br>
asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-<br>
threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for<br>
enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the<br>
presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential<br><br>
glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine<br>
or threonine, although 5-hydroxyprc line or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.<br>
[0188]	Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished<br>
by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-<br>
described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also<br>
be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to<br>
the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).<br>
[0189]	The glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering<br>
the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to<br>
express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins,<br>
e.g. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, variations in the<br>
glycosylation pattern of the antibod es can be expected (see, e.g. Hse et al., 1997, J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 272:9062-9070).<br>
[0190]	In addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect glycosylation<br>
during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation,<br>
culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have<br>
been proposed to alter the glycosyh tion pattern achieved in a particular host organism<br>
including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide<br>
production (U. S. Patent Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or<br>
certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for<br>
example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be<br>
genetically engineered to be defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides.<br>
These and similar techniques are well known in the art.<br>
[0191]	Other methods of modification include using coupling techniques known in<br>
the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation.<br>
Modifications can be used, for exarnple, for attachment of labels for immunoassay.<br>
Modified E3 polypeptides are made using established procedures in the art and can be<br>
screened using standard assays known in the art, some of which are described below and in<br>
the Examples.<br>
[0192]	Other antibody mod fications include antibodies that have been modified as<br>
described in PCT Publication No. VO 99/58572, published November 18, 1999. These<br><br>
antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain directed at the target molecule, an<br>
effector domain having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a<br>
constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of<br>
binding the target molecule without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or<br>
cell-mediated destruction of the target. In some embodiments, the effector domain is<br>
capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or FcγRIIb. These are typically based on<br>
chimeric domains derived from two or more human immunoglobulin heavy chain CH2<br>
domains. Antibodies modified in this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic<br>
antibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reactions to conventional<br>
antibody therapy.<br>
[10193]	The invention also encompasses fusion proteins comprising one or more<br>
fragments or regions from the antibodies (such as E3) or polypeptides of this invention. In<br>
one embodiment, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 contiguous<br>
amino acids of the variable light chain region shown in Figure 1B and/or at least 10 amino<br>
acids of the variable heavy chain region shown in Figure 1 A. In another embodiment, the<br>
fusion polypeptide comprises a lignt chain variable region and/or a heavy chain variable<br>
region of E3, as shown in Figures 1A and 1B. In another embodiment, the fusion<br>
polypeptide comprises one or more CDR(s) of E3. In still other embodiments, the fusion<br>
polypeptide comprises CDR H3 and/or CDR L3 of antibody E3. In another embodiment,<br>
the fusion polypeptide comprises any one or more of: amino acid residue L29 of CDRH1,<br>
I50 of CDRH2, W101 of CDRH3, and/or A103 of CDRH3; and/or amino acid residue S28<br>
ofCDRLl,N32 of CDRLl, T51 Of CDRL2, 91E of CDRL3 and/or H92 of CDRL3. For<br>
purposes of this invention, a E3 fusion protein contains one or more E3 antibodies and<br>
another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule, for<br>
example, a heterologous sequenc e or a homologous sequence from another region.<br>
Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are not limited to a "tag" such as a FLAG<br>
tag or a 6His tag. Tags are well known in the art.<br>
[0194]	A E3 fusion polypeptide can be created by methods known in the art, for<br>
example, synthetically or recombinantly. Typically, the E3 fusion proteins of this<br>
invention are made by preparing an expressing a polynucleotide encoding them using<br>
recombinant methods described herein, although they may also be prepared by other means<br>
known in the art, including, for example, chemical synthesis.<br><br>
[0195]	This invention also provides compositions comprising E3 antibodies or<br>
polypeptides conjugated (for example, linked) to an agent that facilitate coupling to a solid<br>
support (such as biotin or avidin). I or simplicity, reference will be made generally to E3 or<br>
antibodies with the understanding that these methods apply to any of the NGF binding<br>
embodiments described herein. Conjugation generally refers to linking these components<br>
as described herein. The linking (which is generally fixing these components in proximate<br>
association at least for administration) can be achieved in any number of ways. For<br>
example, a direct reaction between an agent and an antibody is possible when each<br>
possesses a substituent capable of reacting with the other. For example, a nucleophilic<br>
group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl group, on one may be capable of reacting with a<br>
carbonyl-containing group, such as an anhydride or an acid halide, or with an alkyl group<br>
containing a good leaving group (e.g., a halide) on the other.<br>
[0196]	An antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be linked to a labeling<br>
agent (alternatively termed "label") such as a fluorescent molecule, a radioactive molecule.<br>
or any others labels known in the an. Labels are known in the art which generally provide<br>
(either directly or indirectly) a signa . Accordingly, the invention includes labeled<br>
antibodies and polypeptides.<br>
[0197]	The ability of the antibodies and polypeptides of this invention, such as<br>
binding NGF; reducing or inhibiting a NGF biological activity; reducing and/or blocking<br>
NGF-induced survival of E13.5 mouse trigeminal neurons, may be tested using methods<br>
known in the art, some of which are described in the Examples.<br>
[0198]	The invention also provides compositions (including pharmaceutical<br>
compositions) and kits comprising antibody E3, and, as this disclosure makes clear, any or<br>
all of the antibodies and/or polypeptides described herein.<br>
Polynucleotides, vectors and host ce ',ls<br>
[0199]	The invention also provides isolated polynucleotides encoding the<br>
antibodies and polypeptides of the invention (including an antibody comprising the<br>
polypeptide sequences of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions shown in Figures<br>
1A and 1B), and vectors and host cells comprising the polynucleotide.<br>
[0200]	Accordingly, the invention provides polynucleotides (or compositions,<br>
including pharmaceutical compositions), comprising polynucleotides encoding any of the<br><br>
following: (a) antibody E3; (b) a fragment or a region of the antibody E3; (c) a light chain<br>
of the antibody E3 as shown in Figures 1B; (d) a heavy chain of the antibody E3 as shown<br>
in Figures 1A; (e) one or more variable region(s) from a light chain and/or a heavy chain of<br>
the antibody E3; (f) one or more CDR(s) (one, two, three, four, five or six CDRs) of<br>
antibody E3 shown in Figures 1A and 1B; (g) COR H3 from the heavy chain of antibody<br>
E3 shown in figure 1A; (h) CDR L3 from the light chain of antibody E3 shown in Figure<br>
1B; (i) three CDRs from the light chain of antibody E3 shown in Figure IB; (j) three CDRs<br>
from the heavy chain of antibody E3 shown in Figure 1 A; (k) three CDRs from the light<br>
chain and three CDRs from the heavy chain, of antibody E3 shown in Figures 1A and 1B;<br>
or (1) an antibody comprising any of (b) to (k). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide<br>
comprises either or both of the polynucleotide(s) shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
[0201]	In another aspect, the invention is an isolated polynucleotide that encodes<br>
for an E3 light chain with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4893 or ATCC No. PTA-<br>
4894. In another aspect, the invention is an isolated polynucleotide that encodes for an E3<br>
heavy chain with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4895. In yet another aspect, the<br>
invention is an isolated polynucleotide comprising (a) a variable region encoded in the<br>
polynucleotide with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4894 and (b) a variable region<br>
encoded in the polynucleotide with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4895. In another<br>
aspect, the invention is an isolated polynucleotide comprising (a) one or more CDR<br>
encoded in the polynucleotide with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-4894; and/or (b)<br>
one or more CDR encoded in the polynucleotide with a deposit number of ATCC No. PTA-<br>
4895.<br>
[0202]	In another aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding any of<br>
the antibodies (including antibody 1 ragments) and polypeptides described herein.<br>
Polynucleotides can be made by procedures known in the art<br>
[0203]	In another aspect, the invention provides compositions (such as a<br>
pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any of the polynucleotides of the invention. In<br>
some embodiments, the compositic n comprises an expression vector comprising a<br>
polynucleotide encoding the E3 amibody as described herein. In other embodiment, the<br>
composition comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding any of<br>
the antibodies or polypeptides described herein. In still other embodiments, the<br>
composition comprises either or both of the polynucleotides shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br><br>
Expression vectors, and administration of polynucleotide compositions are further<br>
described herein.<br>
[0204]	In another aspect, the invention provides a method of making any of the<br>
polynucleotides described herein.<br>
[0205]	Polynucleotides comp lementary to any such sequences are also<br>
encompassed by the present invention Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or<br>
antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA<br>
molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and<br>
correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do<br>
not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be<br>
present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but<br>
need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials.<br>
[0206]	Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous<br>
sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a<br>
sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions<br>
and/or insertions such that the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not<br>
diminished, relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the<br>
immunoreactivity of the encoded po ypeptide may generally be assessed as described<br>
herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably at least<br>
about 80% identity and most preferably at least about 90% identity to a polynucleotide<br>
sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion thereof.<br>
[0207]	Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be "identical" if the<br>
sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for<br>
maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are<br>
typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and<br>
compare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison window" as used herein,<br>
refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, 40 to<br>
about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same<br>
number of contiguous positions afte the two sequences are optimally aligned.<br>
[0208]	Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the<br>
Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc.,<br>
Madison, WI), using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment<br><br>
schemes described in the following references: Dayhoff, MO. (1978) A model of<br>

comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison of at least 20<br>
positions, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the<br>
comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e. gaps) of 20 percent or less,<br>
usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which<br>
does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The<br>
percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical<br>
nucleic acid bases or amino acid resicue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of<br>
matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of<br>
positions in the reference sequence (i.e.. the window size) and multiplying the results by<br>
100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.<br>
[0210]	Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native<br>
gene; or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of<br>
hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence<br>
encoding a native antibody (or a complementary sequence).<br>
[0211]	Suitable "moderately stringent conditions" include prewashing in a solution<br>
of 5 X SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50°C-65°C, 5 X SSC,<br>
overnight; followed by washing twice at 65°C for 20 minutes with each of 2X, 0.5X and<br>
0.2X SSC containing 0. 1 % SDS.<br>
[0212]	As used herein, "highly stringent conditions" or "high stringency conditions"<br>
are those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for<br><br>
example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at<br>
50°C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example,<br>
50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bov ne serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1%<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone/50mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium<br>
chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42oC; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (0.75 M<br>
NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium<br>
pyrophosphate, 5 x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 µg/ml), 0.1%<br>
SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42°0, with washes at 42°C in 0.2 x SSC (sodium<br>
chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55°C, followed by a high-stringency wash<br>
consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55°C. The skilled artisan will recognize how<br>
to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as<br>
probe length and the like.<br>
[0213]	It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, as a result of<br>
the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are many nucleotide sequences that encode a<br>
polypeptide as described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to<br>
the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to<br>
differences in codon usage are specif cally contemplated by the present invention. Further,<br>
alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of<br>
one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The<br>
resulting mRNA and protein may, butneed not, have an altered structure or function.<br>
Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification<br>
and/or database sequence comparisor).<br>
[0214]	The polynucleotides of this invention can be obtained using chemical<br>
synthesis, recombinant methods, or PCR. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis<br>
are well known in the art and need not be described in detail herein. One of skill in the art<br>
can use the sequences provided herein and a commercial DNA synthesizer to produce a<br>
desired DNA sequence.<br>
[0215]	For preparing polynuc leotides using recombinant methods, a polynucleotide<br>
comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn<br>
can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification, as further<br>
discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be inserted into host cells by any means known in<br><br>
the art. Cells are transformed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide by direct<br>
uptake, endocytosis, transfection, F- mating or electroporation. Once introduced, the<br>
exogenous polynucleotide can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector<br>
(such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome. The polynucleotide so<br>
amplified can be isolated from the host cell by methods well known within the art. See,<br>
e.g., Sambrook et al. (1989).<br>
[02161	Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA sequences, PCR<br>
technology is well known in the arc and is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195,<br>
4,800,159,4,754,065 and 4,683,202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction,<br>
Muilis et al. eds., Birkauswer Press, Boston (1994).<br>
[0217]	RNA can be obtaired by using the isolated DNA in an appropriate vector<br>
and inserting it into a suitable host cell. When the cell replicates and the DNA is<br>
transcribed into RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well known to those of<br>
skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et al., (1989), for example.<br>
[0218]	Suitable cloning vectors may be constructed according to standard<br>
techniques, or may be selected from a large number of cloning vectors available in the art.<br>
While the cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used,<br>
useful cloning vectors will generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single<br>
target for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that<br>
can be used in selecting clones containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids<br>
and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUC 18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives,<br>
mpl8, mpl9, pBR322, pMB9, ColEl, pCRl, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such<br>
as pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are available from commercial<br>
vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and Invitrogen.<br>
[0219]	Expression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that<br>
contain a polynucleotide according to the invention. It is implied that an expression vector<br>
must be replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral part of the<br>
chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids,<br>
viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, and<br>
expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462. Vector components<br>
may generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal<br>
sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes; suitable transcriptional<br><br>
[0223]	Any of a variety of known methods can be used for detection, including, but<br>
not limited to, immunoassay, using antibody that binds the polypeptide, e.g. by enzyme-<br>
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the like; and<br>
functional assay for the encoded poly peptide, e.g. binding activity or enzymatic assay. In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody is detectably labeled.<br>
Diagnostic Uses of the E3 and Derivatives<br>
[0224]	Antibodies and polypeptides of the invention can be used in the detection,<br>
diagnosis and monitoring of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with altered or<br>
aberrant NGF expression (in some embodiments, increased or decreased NGF expression<br>
(relative to a normal sample), and/or inappropriate expression, such as presence of<br>
expression in tissue(s) and/or cell(s) that normally lack NGF expression, or absence of<br>
NGF expression in tissue(s) or cell(s) that normally possess NGF expression). The<br>
antibodies and polypeptides of the invention are further useful for detection of NGF<br>
expression, for example, in a disease associated with altered or aberrant sensitivity or<br>
responsiveness to NGF. In some embodiments, NGF expression is detected in a sample<br>
from an individual suspected of having a disease, disorder featuring or associated with an<br>
altered or aberrant sensitivity or responsiveness to NGF expression (e.g., a cancer in which<br>
NGF promotes growth and/or metastasis).<br>
[0225]	Thus, in some embodiments, the invention provides methods comprising<br>
contacting a specimen (sample) of an individual suspected of having altered or aberrant<br>
NGF expression with an antibody or polypeptide of the invention and determining whether<br>
the level of NGF differs from that of a control or comparison specimen. In some<br>
embodiments, the individual has a cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, and/or<br>
autonomic dysfunction.<br>
[0226]	In other embodiments, the invention provides methods comprises contacting<br>
a specimen (sample) of an individual and determining level of NGF expression. In some<br>
embodiments, the individual is suspected of having a disease, disorder featuring or<br>
associated with an altered or aberrant sensitivity or responsiveness to NGF expression. In<br>
some embodiments, the individual has small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic<br>
cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or melanoma.<br><br>
[0227]	For diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a<br>
detectable moiety including but not limited to radioisotopes, fluorescent labels, and various<br>
enzyme-substrate labels. Methods oi conjugating labels to an antibody are known in the<br>
art. In other embodiment of the invention, antibodies of the invention need not be labeled,<br>
and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the<br>
antibodies of the invention.<br>
[0228]	The antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known<br>
assay method, such competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and<br>
immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques,<br>
pp.147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).<br>
[0229]	The antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays, such as in<br>
vivo imaging. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide (such as 111In, 99Tc,<br>
14C, 1311,125I, or 3H) so that the cells or tissue of interest can be localized using<br>
immunoscintiography.<br>
[0230]	The antibody may also be used as staining reagent in pathology, following<br>
techniques well known in the art.<br>
Methods of using E3 and derivatives for therapeutic purposes<br>
[0231]	Antibody E3 is useful for reducing and/or blocking the biological activity of<br>
NGF. This antagonistic activity is believed to be useful in the treatment of pathological<br>
conditions associated with endogenous NGF production, such as pain. Generally, in these<br>
embodiments an effective amount is administered to an individual. Accordingly, in one <br>
aspect, the invention provides a method of antagonizing human NGF biological activity<br>
using any of the polypeptides (includ ng antibodies such as antibody E3) disclosed herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting human nerve growth factor with any<br>
of the polypeptides (including antibody E3) described herein, whereby human nerve growth<br>
factor activity is antagonized, reduced, blocked, or suppressed. In yet another embodiment,<br>
an individual with pain (such as post-surgical pain, or rheumatoid arthritis pain) is given<br>
treatment with E3.<br>
[0232]	For simplicity, reference will be made generally to E3 or antibody with the<br>
understanding that these methods apply to any of the E3 variant antibodies and<br>
polypeptides described herein.<br><br>
[0233]	Various formulations of E3 or fragments of E3 (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv,<br>
Fc, etc.), such as single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an<br>
antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of E3 that comprises an antigen<br>
NGF recognition site of the required specificity, may be used for administration. In some<br>
embodiments, E3 antibodies or various formulations of E3 thereof may be administered<br>
neat. In other embodiments, E3 or various formulations of E3 (including any composition<br>
embodiment described herein) thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient are<br>
administered, and may be in various formulations. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients<br>
are known in the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate administration of a<br>
pharmacologically effective substance. For example, an excipient can give form or<br>
consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to<br>
stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolality,<br>
encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as<br>
formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in Remington, The<br>
Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack Publishing (2000).<br>
[0234]	In some embodiments, these agents are formulated for administration by<br>
injection (e.g., intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, etc.),<br>
although other forms of administration (e.g., oral, mucosal, via inhalation, sublingually,<br>
etc) can be also used. Accordingly, E3 antibody and equivalents thereof are preferably<br>
combined with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's solution,<br>
dextrose solution, and the like. The particular dosage regimen, i.e., dose, timing and<br>
repetition, will depend on the particular individual and that individual's medical history.<br>
Generally, any of the following doses may be used: a dose of at least about 50 mg/kg body<br>
weight; at least about 10 mg/kg body weight; at least about 3 mg/kg body weight; at least<br>
about 1 mg/kg body weight; at least about 750 µg/kg body weight; at least about 500 µg/kg<br>
body weight; at least about 250 ug/kg body weight; at least about 100 µg /kg body weight;<br>
at least about 50 µg /kg body weight; at least about 10 ug /kg body weight; at least about 1<br>
µg/kg body weight, or less, is administered. For repeated administrations over several days<br>
or longer, depending on the conditior, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression<br>
of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an<br>
initial dose of about 2 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg of<br>
the anti-NGF antibody, or followed by a maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg every other<br><br>
week. However, other dosage regimens may be useful, depending on the pattern of<br>
pharmacokinetic decay that the pract tioner wishes to achieve. Empirical considerations,<br>
such as the half- life, generally will contribute to determination of the dosage. The<br>
progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.<br>
[02351	In some individuals, n tore than one dose may be required. Frequency of<br>
administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy. For example,<br>
frequency of administration may be cetermined or adjusted based on the type and severity<br>
of the pain to be treated, whether the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic<br>
purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the agent, and the<br>
discretion of the attending physician. Typically the clinician will administer an anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody (such as E3), unti1 a dosage is reached that achieves the desired result.<br>
In some cases, sustained continuous release formulations of E3 antibodies may be<br>
appropriate. Various formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known<br>
in the art.<br>
[0236]	In one embodiment, d( sages for E3 antibodies (or polypeptides) may be<br>
determined empirically in individuals who have been given one or more administration(s).<br>
Individuals are given incremental dosages of E3. To assess efficacy of E3 or other<br>
equivalent antibody, markers of the disease symptoms (such as pain) can be monitored.<br>
[0237]	Administration of an antibody (such as E3) or polypeptide in accordance<br>
with the method in the present inventi an can be continuous or intermittent, depending, for<br>
example, upon the recipient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the<br>
administration is therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled<br>
practitioners. The administration of an antibody may be essentially continuous over a<br>
preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced dose, e.g., either before, during,<br>
or after developing pain, before, during. before and after, during and after, or before,<br>
during, and after developing pain. Administration can be before, during and/or after<br>
wound, incision, trauma, surgery, and any other event likely to give rise to post-surgical<br>
pain.<br>
[0238]	Other formulations include suitable delivery forms known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to, carriers suach as liposomes. See, for example, Mahato et al.<br>
(1997) Pharm. Res. 14:853-859. Liposomal preparations include, but are not limited to,<br>
cytofectins, multilamellar vesicles and unilamellar vesicles.<br><br>
[0239]	In some embodiments, more than one antibody or polypeptide may be<br>
present. The antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal. Such compositions may contain<br>
at least one, at least two, at least thre, at least four, at least five different antibodies. A<br>
mixture of antibodies, as they are often denoted in the art, may be particularly useful in<br>
treating a broader range of population of individuals.<br>
[0240]	A polynucleotide encoding any of the antibodies or polypeptides of the<br>
invention (such as antibody E3) may also be used for delivery and expression of any of the<br>
antibodies or polypeptides of the invention (such as antibody E3) in a desired cell. It is<br>
apparent that an expression vector can be used to direct expression of an E3 antibody or<br>
polypeptide. The expression vector can be administered by any means known in the art,<br>
such as intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally,<br>
intraventricularly, orally, enterally, parenterally, intranasally, dermally, sublingually, or by<br>
inhalation. For example, administration of expression vectors includes local or systemic<br>
administration, including injection, oial administration, particle gun or catheterized<br>
administration, and topical administration. One skilled in the art is familiar with<br>
administration of expression vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo.<br>
See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471.<br>
[0241]	Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions comprising a polynucleotide<br>
encoding any of the antibodies or polypeptides of the invention (such as antibody E3) can<br>
also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are described in, for example,<br>
Findeis et al., Trends Biotechnol. (1993) 11:202; Chiou et al.. Gene Therapeutics: Methods<br>
And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J.A. Wolff, ed.) (1994); Wu et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. (1988) 263:621; Wu et al., J. Biol Chem. (1994) 269:542; Zenke et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad Sci. (USA) (1990) 87:3655; Wu et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1991) 266:338. Therapeutic<br>
compositions containing a polynuclectide are aolministered in a range of about 100 ng to<br>
about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration<br>
ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 µg to about 2 mg, about 5 µg to about 500<br>
µg, and about 20 µg to about 100 µg of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy<br>
protocol. The therapeutic polynucleo ides and polypeptides of the present invention can be<br>
delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-<br>
viral origin (see generally, Jolly, Cancer Gene Therapy (1994) 1:51; Kimura, Human Gene<br>
Therapy (1994) 5:845; Connelly, Human Gene Therapy (1995) 1:185; and Kaplitt, Nature<br><br>
Genetics (1994) 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using<br>
endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence<br>
can be either constitutive or regulited.<br>
[0242]	Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression<br>
in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are<br>
not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 90/07936;<br>

No. 0 345 242), alphavirus-based vectors (e.g., Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus<br>
(ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247) Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and<br>
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249;<br>
ATCC VR-532)), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (see, e.g., PCT Publication<br>
Nos. WO 94/12649, WO 93/0376'); WO 93/19191; WO 94/28938; WO 95/11984 and WO<br>
95/00655). Administration of DNA linked to killed adenovirus as described in Curiel,<br>
Hum. Gene Ther. (1992) 3:147 can also be employed.<br>
[0243]	Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including,<br>
but not limited to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus<br>
alone (see, e.g., Curiel, Hum. Gene. Ther. (1S&gt;92) 3:147); ligand-linked DNA(see, e.g., Wu,<br>
J. Biol. Chem. (1989) 264:16985); eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e.g., U.S.<br>

and WO 97/42338) and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes.<br>
Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are<br>
described in PCT Publication No. WO 90/11092 and U.S. Patent No. 5,580,859.<br>

[0244]	With respect to all methods described herein, reference to anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibodies also include compositions comprising one or more of these agents.<br>
These compositions may further co uprise suitable excipients, such as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art. The present<br><br>
invention can be used alone or in combination with other conventional methods of<br>
treatment.<br>
METHODS OF USING ANTI-NGF ANTAGONIST ANTIBODY FOR TREATING<br>
OR PREVENTING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PAIN<br>
[0245]	In some aspects, the invention provides methods for treating and/or<br>
preventing rheumatoid arthritis painan individutals including mammals, both human and<br>
non-human. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides methods of treating<br>
rheumatoid arthritis pain in an individual comprising administering an effective amount of<br>
an anti-NGF antagonist antibody. Anti-NGF antagonist antibodies are known in the art and<br>
described herein.<br>
[0246]	In another aspect, the invention provides methods for reducing incidence of,<br>
ameliorating, suppressing, palliating and/or delaying the onset, the development or the<br>
progression of rheumatoid arthritis pain in an individual. Thus, in some embodiments, the<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody is administered prior to development of pain or a pain<br>
episode in an individual having rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
[0247]	In another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating inflammatory<br>
cachexia (weight loss) associated with rheumatoid arthritis in an individual comprising<br>
administering an effective amount of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody (Roubenoff et al.,<br>
Arthritis Rheum. 40(3): 534-9 (1997): Roubenoff et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93(6):2379-86<br>
(1994)).<br>
[0248]	Diagnosis or assessment of rheumatoid arthritis pain is well-established in<br>
the art. Assessment may be performed based on measures known in the art, such as patient<br>
characterization of pain using various pain scales. See, e.g., Katz et al, Surg Clin North<br>
Am. (1999) 79 (2):231-52; Caraceni et al. J Pain Symptom Manage (2002) 23(3):239-55.<br>
There are also commonly used scales to measure disease state such as the American<br>
College of Rheumatology (ACR) (pelson, et al., Arthritis and Rheumatism (1993)<br>
36(6):729-740), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (Fries, et al., (1982) J.<br>
Rheumatol. 9: 789-793), the Paulus Scale (Paulus, et al., Arthritis and Rheumatism (1990)<br>
33: 477-484), and the Arthritis Impact Measure Scale (AIMS) (Meenam, et al., Arthritis<br>
and Rheumatology (1982) 25: 1048-1053). Anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be<br><br>
administered to an individual via any suitable route. Examples of different administration<br>
route are described herein.<br>
[0249]	Pain relief may be characterized by time course of relief. Accordingly, in<br>
some embodiments, pain relief is observed wthin about 24 hours after administration of<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody. In other embodiments, pain relief is observed within about<br>
36,48,60,72 hours or 4 days after administration of anti-NGF antagonist antibody. In still<br>
other embodiments, pain relief is observed before observing an indication of improvement<br>
of the inflammatory condition associated with rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments,<br>
frequency and/or intensity of pain as diminished, and/or quality of life of those suffering the<br>
the disease is increased.<br>
[0250]	Making and using anti-NGF antibodies for these methods is described in<br>
sections below ("Anti-NGF antagonist antibody"; "Identification of anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibodies"; "Administration of an mti-NGF antagonist antibody").<br>

Am. (1999) 79 (2):231-52; Caraceni et al. J Pain Symptom Manage (2002) 23(3):239-55.<br>
For example, WOMAC Ambulation Pain Scale (including pain, stiffness, and physical<br><br>
function) and 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) may be employed to assess pain and<br>
evaluate response to the treatment.<br>
[0254]	Anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be administered to an individual via any<br>
suitable route. Examples of different administration route are described herein.<br>
[0255]	Pain relief may be characterized by time course of relief. Accordingly, in<br>
some embodiments, pain relief is observed within about 24 hours after administration of<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody. In other embodiments, pain relief is observed within about<br>
36,48,60,72 hours or 4 days after administration of anti-NGF antagonist antibody. In<br>
some embodiments, frequency and/or intensity of pain is diminished, and/or quality of life<br>
of those suffering the the disease is increased.<br>
[0256]	Making and using anti-NGF antibodies for these methods is described in<br>
sections below ("Anti-NGF antagonist antibody"; "Identification of anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibodies"; "Administration of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody").<br>
Anti-NGF antagonist antibody<br>
[0257]	The methods of the invention (pertaining to rheumatoid arthritis pain and<br>
osteoarthritis pain) use an anti-NGF antagonis t antibody, which refers to any antibody<br>
molecule that blocks, suppresses or reduces (including significantly) NGF biological<br>
activity, including downstream pathways mediated by NGF signaling, such as receptor<br>
binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response to NGF.<br>
[0258]	An anti-NGF antagonist antibody should exhibit any one or more of the<br>
following characteristics: (a) bind to NGF and inhibit NGF biological activity or<br>
downstream pathways mediated by NGF signaling function; (b) prevent, ameliorate, or<br>
treat any aspect of rheumatoid arthrtis pain or osteoarthritis pain; (c) block or decrease<br>
NGF receptor activation (including TrkA receptor dimerization and/or<br>
autophosphorylation); (d) increase elearance of NGF; (e) inhibit (reduce) NGF synthesis,<br>
production or release. Anti-NGF antagonist antibodies are known in the art, see, e.g., PCT<br>
Publication Nos. WO 01/78698, WO 01/64247, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,844,092, 5,877,016, and<br>
6,153,189; Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 19:215-227 (2000); Cell. Molec. Biol. 13:559-568<br>

[0259]	For purposes of this invention, the antibody reacts with NGF in a manner<br>
that inhibits NGF and/or downstream pathways mediated by the NGF signaling function.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody recognizes human NGF. In yet<br>
other embodiments, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody specifically binds human NGF. In<br>
some embodiment, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody does not significantly bind to related<br>
neurotrophins, such as NT-3, NT4/5, and/or BDNF. In still other embodiments, the anti-<br>
NGF antibody is capable of bindir g NGF and effectively inhibiting the binding of NGF to<br>
its TrkA and/or p75 receptor in vivo and/or effectively inhibiting NGF from activating its<br>
TrkA and/or p75 receptor. In still other embodiment, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody is a<br>
monoclonal antibody. In still other embodiments, the anti-NGF antibody is humanized<br>
(such as antibody E3 described herein). In some embodiments, the anti-NGF antibody is<br>
human. In one embodiment, the antibody is a human antibody which recognizes one or<br>
more epitopes on human NGF. In another embodiment, the antibody is a mouse or rat<br>
antibody which recognizes one or more epitopes on human NGF. In another embodiment,<br>
the antibody recognizes one or more epitopes on an NGF selected from the group<br>
consisting of: primate, canine, feline, equine, and bovine. In still further embodiments, the<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody bincs essentially the same NGF epitope 6 as an antibody<br>
selected from any one or more of the following: MAb 911, MAb 912 and MAb 938 (See<br>
Hongo, et al., Hybridoma 19:215-227 (2000)). In other embodiments, the antibody binds<br>
the same epitope as Mab 911. In another embodiment, the antibody comprises a constant<br>
region that is immunologically inert (e.g., does not trigger complement mediated lysis or<br>
antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)). ADCC activity can be assessed<br>
using methods disclosed in U.S. Patent NO. 5, 500, 362. In some embodiments, the<br>
constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol. (1999) 29:2613-2624; PCT<br>
Application No. PCT/GB99/01441; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8.<br>
[0260]	In some embodiments, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody is a humanized<br>
mouse anti-NGF monoclonal antibody termed antibody "E3", any of the E3 related<br>
antibodies described herein, or any fragments: thereof, which are NGF antagonists.<br>
(02611	The antibodies useful in the present invention can encompass monoclonal<br>
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fc,<br>
etc.), chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, heteroconjugate antibodies, single chain<br>
(ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, humanized<br>
antibodies, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that<br>
comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity, including glycosylation<br><br>
variants of antibodies, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies, and covalently modified<br>
antibodies. The antibodies may be rnurine, rat, human, or any other origin (including<br>
chimeric or humanized antibodies).<br>
[0262]	The binding affinity of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody to NGF (such as<br>
hNGF) can be about 0.10 to about 0.80 nM, about 0.15 to about 0.75 nM and about 0.18 to<br>
about 0.72 nM. In one embodiment, the binding affinity is between about 2 pM and 22<br>
pM. In some embodiment, the binding affinity is about 10 nM. In other embodiments, the<br>
binding affinity is less than about 10 nM. In other embodiments, the binding affinity is<br>
about 0.1 nM or about 0.07 nM. In other embodiments, the binding affinity is less than<br>
about 0.1 nM or less than about 0.0 7 nM. In other embodiments, the binding affinity is any<br>
of about 100 nM, about 50 nM, abcut 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, or<br>
about 50 pM to any of about 2 pM, about 5 pM, about 10 pM, about 15 pM, about 20 pM,<br>
or about 40 pM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is any of about 100 nM, about<br>
50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, or about 50 pM, or less<br>
than about 50 pM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is less than any of about 100<br>
nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, or about 50<br>
pM. In still other embodiments, the binding affinity is about 2 pM, about 5 pM, about 10<br>
pM, about 15 pM, about 20 pM, about 40 pM, or greater than about 40 pM.<br>
[0263]	One way of determ ning binding affinity of antibodies to NGF is by<br>
measuring binding affinity of monofunctional Fab fragments of the antibody. To obtain<br>
monofunctional Fab fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be cleaved with papain<br>
or expressed recombinantly. The iffinity of an anti-NGF Fab fragment of an antibody can<br>
be determined by surface plasmon resonance (BlAcore3000™ surface plasmon resonance<br>
(SPR) system, BIAcore, INC, Piscaway NJ). CM5 chips can be activated with N-ethyl-N'-<br>
(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodi nide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human NGF (or any other NGF) can be<br>
diluted into 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 and injected over the activated chip at a<br>
concentration of 0.005 mg/mL. Using variable flow time across the individual chip<br>
channels, two ranges of antigen density can be achieved: 100-200 response units (RU) for<br>
detailed kinetic studies and 500-630 RU for screening assays. The chip can be blocked<br>
with ethanolamine. Regeneration studies have shown that a mixture of Pierce elution<br>
buffer (Product No. 21004, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford IL) and 4 M NaCl (2:1)<br><br>
effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of hNGF on the chip for over<br>
200 injections. HBS-EP buffer (0 01M HEPES, pH 7.4,0.15 NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.005%<br>
Surfactant P29) is used as running buffer for the BIAcore assays. Serial dilutions (0.1-1 ox<br>
estimated KD) of purified Fab samples are injected for 1 min at 100 µL/min and<br>
dissociation times of up to 2h are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins are<br>
determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known<br>
concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard. Kinetic association<br>
rates (kon) and dissociation rates (toff) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data to a<br>
1:1 Langmuir binding model (KarLsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. (1994).<br>
Methods Enzymologv 6. 99-110) tsing the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium<br>
dissociation constant (KD) values are calculated as koff/kon. This protocol is suitable for use<br>
in determining binding affinity of an antibody to any NGF, including human NGF, NGF of<br>
another vertebrate (in some embodiments, mammalian) (such as mouse NGF, rat NGF,<br>
primate NGF), as well as for use with other neurotrophins, such as the related<br>
neurotrophins NT3, NT4/5, and/or BDNF.<br>
[0264]	In some embodiments, the antibody binds human NGF, and does not<br>
significantly bind an NGF from another vertebrate species (in some embodiment,<br>
mammalian). In some embodimen s, the antibody binds human NGF as well as one or<br>
more NGF from another vertebrate species (in some embodiments, mammalian). In still<br>
other embodiments, the antibody binds NGF and does not significantly cross-react with<br>
other neurotrophins (such as the related neurotrophins, NT3, NT4/5, and/or BDNF). In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody binds NGF as well as at least one other neurotrophin. In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody binds to a mammalian species of NGF, such as horse or<br>
dog, but does not significantly bind to NGF from anther mammalian species.<br>
[0265]	The epitope(s) can be continuous or discontinuous. In one embodiment, the<br>
antibody binds essentially the same hNGF epitopes as an antibody selected from the group<br>
consisting of MAb 911, MAb 912, and MAb 938 as described in Hongo et al., Hybridoma,<br>
19:215-227 (2000). In another embodiment, the antibody binds essentially the same hNGF<br>
epitope as MAb 911. In still another embodiment, the antibody binds essentially the same<br>
epitope as MAb 909. Hongo et al., supra. For example, the epitope may comprise one or<br>
more of: residues K32, K34 and E35 within variable region 1 (amino acids 23-35) of<br>
hNGF; residues F79 and T81 within variable region 4 (amino acids 81-88) of hNGF;<br><br>
residues H84 and K88 within variable region 4; residue R103 between variable region 5<br>
(amino acids 94-98) of hNGF and the C-terminus (amino acids 111-118) of hNGF; residue<br>
El 1 within pre-variable region 1 (amino acids 10-23) of hNGF; Y52 between variable<br>
region 2 (amino acids 40-49) of hNGF and variable region 3 (amino acids 59-66) of hNGF;<br>
residues L112 and S113 within the C-terminus of hNGF; residues R59 and R69 within<br>
variable region 3 of hNGF; or residues V18, V20, and G23 within pre-variable region 1 of<br>
hNGF. In addition, an epitope can comprise one or more of the variable region 1, variable<br>
region 3, variable region 4, variable region 5, the N-terminus region, and /or the C-terminus<br>
of hNGF. In still another embodiment, the antibody significantly reduces the solvent<br>
accessibility of residue R103 of hNGF. It is understood that although the epitopes<br>
described above relate to human NGF, one of ordinary skill can align the structures of<br>
human NGF with the NGF of other species and identify likely counterparts to these<br>
epitopes.<br>
[0266]	In one aspect, antibodies (e.g., human, humanized, mouse, chimeric) that<br>
can inhibit NGF may be made by using immunogens that express full length or partial<br>
sequence of NGF. In another aspect, an immunogen comprising a cell that overexpresses<br>
NGF may be used. Another example of an immunogen that can be used is NGF protein<br>
that contains full-length NGF or a portion of the NGF protein.<br>
[0267]	The anti-NGF antagonist antibodies may be made by any method known in<br>
the art. The route and schedule of immunization of the host animal are generally in<br>
keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and<br>
production, as further described herein. General techniques for production of human and<br>
mouse antibodies are known in the art and are described herein.<br>
[0268]	It is contemplated that any mammalian subject including humans or<br>
antibody producing cells therefrom can be manipulated to serve as the basis for production<br>
of mammalian, including human, hybridoma cell lines. Typically, the host animal is<br>
inoculated intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, orally, subcutaneously, intraplantar, and/or<br>
intradermally with an amount of inununogen, including as described herein.<br>
[0269]	Hybridomas can be prepared from the lymphocytes and immortalized<br>
myeloma cells using the general somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler, B. and<br>
Milstein, C. (1975) Nature 256:495-497 or as modified by Buck, D. W., et al., In Vitro,<br>
18:377-381 (1982). Available myeloma lines, including but not limited to X63-Ag8.653<br><br>
and those from the Salk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, may be<br>
used in the hybridization. Generally, the technique involves fusing myeloma cells and<br>
lymphoid cells using a fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical means well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, the cells are separated from the fusion<br>
medium and grown in a selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminopterin-<br>
thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized parent cells. Any of the media<br>
described herein, supplemented with or without serum, can be used for culturing<br>
hybridomas that secrete monoclor al antibodies. As another alternative to the cell fusion<br>
technique, EBV immortalized B cells may be used to produce the anti-NGF monoclonal<br>
antibodies of the subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded and subcloned, if<br>
desired, and supernatants are assayed for anti-immunogen activity by conventional<br>
immunoassay procedures (e.g., radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or fluorescence<br>
immunoassay).<br>
[0270]	Hybridomas that may be used as source of antibodies encompass all<br>
derivatives, progeny cells of the parent hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies<br>
specific for NGF, or a portion thereof.<br>
[0271]	Hybridomas that produce such antibodies may be grown in vitro or in vivo<br>
using known procedures. The monoclonal antibodies may be isolated from the culture<br>
media or body fluids, by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as<br>
ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, chromatography, and<br>
ultrafiltration, if desired. Undesired activity if present, can be removed, for example, by<br>
running the preparation over adsorbents made of the immunogen attached to a solid phase<br>
and eluting or releasing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization of a host<br>
animal with a human NGF, or a fragment containing the target amino acid sequence<br>
conjugated to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole<br>
limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor<br>
using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide<br>
ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine<br>
residues), glytaradehyde, succinic anhydride, SOC12, or R1N=C=NR, where R and Rl are<br>
different alkyl groups, can yield a population of antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies).<br>
[0272]	If desired, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) of<br>
interest may be sequenced and the polynucleotide sequence may then be cloned into a<br><br>
vector for expression or propagation. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may<br>
be maintained in vector in a host ce 1 and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for<br>
future use. In an alternative, the polynucleotide sequence may be used for genetic<br>
manipulation to "humanize" the antibody or to improve the affinity, or other characteristics<br>
of the antibody. For example, the constant region may be engineered to more resemble<br>
human constant regions to avoid immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials<br>
and treatments in humans. It may be desirable to genetically manipulate the antibody<br>
sequence to obtain greater affinity to NGF and greater efficacy in inhibiting NGF. It will<br>
be apparent to one of skill in the art that one or more polynucleotide changes can be made<br>
to the anti-NGF antagonist antibody and still maintain its binding ability to NGF.<br>
[02731]	There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are:<br>
(1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody<br>
light and heavy variable domains (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding<br>
which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process (3) the actual<br>
humanizing methodologies/techniques and (4) the transfection and expression of the<br>
humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S Patent Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692;<br>
6,331,415; 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.<br>
[0274]	A number of "humamzed" antibody molecules comprising an antigen-<br>
binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including<br>
chimeric antibodies having rodem or modified rodent V regions and their associated<br>
complementarity determining reg ons (CDFs) fused to human constant domains. See, for<br>
example, Winter et al. Nature 34S :293-299 (1991), Lobuglio et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 86:4220-4224 (1989), Shaw et al. J Immunol. 138:4534-4538 (1987), and Brown et<br>
al. Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583 (1987). Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into<br>
a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human<br>
antibody constant domain. See, lor example, Riechmann et al. Nature 332:323-327 (1988),<br>
Verhoeyen et al. Science 239:1534-1536 (1988), and Jones et al. Nature 321:522-525<br>
(1986). Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly veneered<br>
rodent framework regions. See, or example, European Patent Publication No. 0519596.<br>
These "humanized" molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response<br>
toward rodent anti-human antibody molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness<br>
of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. For example, the<br><br>
antibody constant region can be engineered such that it is immunologically inert (e.g., does<br>
not trigger complement lysis). See; e.g. PCT Publication No. PCT/GB99/01441; UK<br>
Patent Application No. 9809951.8. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also<br>
be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 19:2471-2476 (1991) and in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671; and 6,350,861;<br>
and in PCT Publication No. WO 01 /27160.<br>
[0275]	In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be obtained by using<br>
commercially available mice that have been engineered to express specific human<br>
immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to produce a more<br>
desirable (e.g., fully human antibodies) or more robust immune response may also be used<br>
for generation of humanized or human antibodies. Examples of such technology are<br>
Xenomouse ™ from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, CA) and HuMAb-Mouse® and TC Mouse™<br>
from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, NJ .<br>
[0276]	In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly and expressed<br>
using any method known in the art. In another alternative, antibodies may be made<br>
recombinantly by phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,332;<br>
5,580,717; 5,733,743; and 6,265,150; and Winter et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455<br>
(1994). Alternatively, the phage display technology (McCafferty et al, Nature 348:552-<br>
553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro,<br>
from immunoglobulin variable (V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors.<br>
According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a<br>
major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as Ml3 or fd, and<br>
displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because<br>
the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome,<br>
selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the<br>
gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of<br>
the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for<br>
review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural<br>
Biology 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage<br>
display. Clackson et al, Nature 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-<br>
oxazolone antibodies from a smal random combinatorial library of V genes derived from<br>
the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors<br><br>
can be constructed and antibodies o a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens)<br>
can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Mark et al, J. Mol Biol.<br>
222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al, EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). In a natural immune<br>
response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation).<br>
Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-<br>
affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during<br>
subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the<br>
technique known as "chain shuffliig." Marks, et al, Bio/Technol'. 10:779-783(1992)). In<br>
this method, the affinity of "prima ry" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be<br>
improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with<br>
repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from<br>
unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody<br>
fragments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for making very large phage<br>
antibody repertoires (also known as "the mother-of-all libraries") has been described by<br>
Waterhouse et al, Nucl Acids Re:. 21:2265-2266 (1993). Gene shuffling can also be used<br>
to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar<br>
affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which<br>
is also referred to as "epitope imprinting", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of<br>
rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of<br>
human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in<br>
isolation of human variable regions capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site,<br>
i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in<br>
order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 93/06213, published April 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization<br>
of rodent antibodies by CDR graf ing, this technique provides completely human<br>
antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.<br>
[0277]	It is apparent that although the above discussion pertains to humanized<br>
antibodies, the general principles discussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for<br>
use, for example, in dogs, cats, pramate, equines and bovines. It is further apparent that one<br>
or more aspects of humanizing an antibody described herein may be combined, e.g., CDR<br>
grafting, framework mutation and CDR mutation.<br><br>
[02781]	Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first isolating the antibodies and<br>
antibody producing cells from host animals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the<br>
gene sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells (e.g., CHO cells).<br>
Another method which may be employed is to express the antibody sequence in plants<br>
(e.g., tobacco) or transgenic milk. Methods for expressing antibodies recombinantly in<br>
plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for example, Peeters, et al. Vaccine 19:2756<br>
(2001); Lonberg, N. and D. Huszar Int.Rev.Immunol 13:65 (1995); and Pollock, et al., J<br>
Immunol Methods 231:147(1999). Methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g.,<br>
humanized, single chain, etc. are known in the art.<br>
[0279]	Immunoassays and flow cytometry sorting techniques such as fluorescence<br>
activated cell sorting (FACS) can also be employed to isolate antibodies that are specific<br>
for NGF.<br>
[0280]	The antibodies can be bound to many different carriers. Carriers can be<br>
active and/or inert. Examples of well-known carriers include polypropylene, polystyrene,<br>
polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, glass, natural and modified celluloses,<br>
polyacrylamides, agaroses and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or<br>
insoluble for purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable<br>
carriers for binding antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine<br>
experimentation. In some embodiments, the carrier comprises a moiety that targets the<br>
myocardium.<br>
[0281]	DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced<br>
using conventional procedures (e.g; by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of<br>
binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated,<br>
the DNA may be placed into expression vectors (such as expression vectors disclosed in<br>
PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462), which are then transfected into host cells such as E.<br>
coli cells, simian COS cells, Chine se hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do<br>
not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal<br>
antibodies in the recombinant host cells. See;, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462.<br>
The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for<br>
human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine<br>
sequences, Morrison et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81:6851 (1984), or by covalently joining<br><br>
to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-<br>
immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, "chimeric" or "hybrid" antibodies are<br>
prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti-NGF monoclonal antibody herein.<br>
[0282]	Anti-NGF antagonist antibodies may be characterized using methods well<br>
known in the art. For example, one method is to identify the epitope to which it binds, or<br>
"epitope mapping." There are many methods known in the art for mapping and<br>
characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of<br>
an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and<br>
synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in Chapter 11 of Harlow and<br>
Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, New York, 1999. in an additional example, epitope mapping can be used to<br>
determine the sequence to which an anti-NGF antagonist antibody binds. Epitope mapping<br>
is commercially available from various sources, for example, Pepscan Systems<br>
(Edelhertweg 15, 8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands).. The epitope can be a linear<br>
epitope, i.e., contained in a single stretch of amino acids, or a conformational epitope<br>
formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino acids that may not necessarily be<br>
contained in a single stretch. Peptides of varying lengths (e.g., at least 4-6 amino acids<br>
long) can be isolated or synthesized (e.g., rscombinantly) and used for binding assays with<br>
an anti-NGF antagonist antibody. In another example, the epitope to which the anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody binds can be determined in a systematic screening by using<br>
overlapping peptides derived from the NGF sequence and determining binding by the anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open<br>
reading frame encoding NGF is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic<br>
constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of NGF with the antibody to be<br>
tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then<br>
transcribed and translated into protein in vitro, in the presence of radioactive amino acids.<br>
The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled NGF fragments is then determined<br>
by immunoprecipitation and ge1 electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by<br>
using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage<br>
particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide<br>
fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. In an<br>
additional example, mutagenesis of an antigen binding domain, domain swapping<br><br>
experiments and alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify residues<br>
required, sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope binding. For example, domain swapping<br>
experiments can be performed using a mutant NGF in which various fragments of the NGF<br>
polypeptide have been replaced (swapped) with sequences from a closely related, but<br>
antigenically distinct protein (such as another member of the neurotrophin protein family).<br>
By assessing binding of the antibody to the mutant NGF, the importance of the particular<br>
NGF fragment to antibody binding can be assessed.<br>
[02S3]	Yet another method which can be used to characterize an anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody is to use competition assays with other antibodies known to bind to the<br>
same antigen, i.e., various fragments on NGF, to determine if the anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibody binds to the same epitope as other antibodies. Competition assays are well known<br>
to those of skill in the art. Example of antibodies that can be used in the competition assays<br>
for the present invention include MAb 911,912-, 938, as described in Hongo, et al.,<br>
Hybridoma 19:215-227 (2000).<br>
[02841	An expression vector can be used to direct expression of an anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody. One skilled in the art is familiar with administration of expression<br>
vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471 Administration of expression vectors includes local<br>
or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or<br>
catheterized administration, and topical administration. In another embodiment, the<br>
expression vector is administered directly to the sympathetic trunk or ganglion, or into a<br>
coronary artery, atrium, ventricle, or pericardium.<br>
[0285]	Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing an expression<br>
vector, or subgenomic polynucleotide s can also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery<br>
techniques are described in, for example, Findeis et al., Trends Biotechnol. (1993) 11:202;<br>
Chiou et al., Gene Therapeutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J.A.<br>

Biol. Chem. (1991) 266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide are<br>
administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration<br>
in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1<br>
ug to about 2 mg, about 5 ug to about 500 µg, and about 20 ug to about 100 µg of DNA<br><br>
can also be used during a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and<br>
polypeptides can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can<br>
be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally, Jolly, Cancer Gene Therapy (1994) 1:51;<br>
Kimura, Human Gene Therapy (1994) 5:845; Connelly, Human Gene Therapy (1995)<br>
1:185; and Kaplitt, Nature Genetics (1994) 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences<br>
can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of<br>
the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.<br>
[0286]	Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression<br>
in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are<br>
not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 90/07936;<br>

virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-<br>
1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC<br>

described in Curiel, Hum. Gene Ther. (1992) 3:147 can also be employed.<br>
[0287]	Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including,<br>

Identification of anti-NGF antagonist antibodies<br>
[0288]	Anti-NGF antagonist antibodies can be identified or characterized using<br>
methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelioration, or neutralization of an NGF<br>
biological activity is detected and/or measured. For example, a kinase receptor activation<br>
(KIRA) assay described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,766,863 and 5,891,650, can be used to<br>
identify anti-NGF agents. This ELLSA-type assay is suitable for qualitative or quantitative<br>
measurement of kinase activation by measuring the autophosphorylation of the kinase<br>
domain of a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (hereinafter "rPTK"), e.g. TrkA receptor, as<br>
well as for identification and characterization of potential antagonists of a selected rPTK,<br>
e.g., TrkA. The first stage of the assay involves phosphorylation of the kinase domain of a<br>
kinase receptor, for example, a TrkA receptor, wherein the receptor is present in the cell<br>
membrane of an eukaryotic cell. The receptor may be an endogenous receptor or nucleic<br>
acid encoding the receptor, or a receptor construct, may be transformed into the cell.<br>
Typically, a first solid phase (e.g., a well of a first assay plate) is coated with a substantially<br>
homogeneous population of such cells (usually a mammalian cell line) so that the cells<br>
adhere to the solid phase. Often, the cells are adherent and thereby adhere naturally to the<br>
first solid phase. If a "receptor construct" is used, it usually comprises a fusion of a kinase<br>
receptor and a flag polypeptide. The lag polypeptide is recognized by the capture agent,<br>
often a capture antibody, in the ELISA part of the assay. An analyte, such as a candidate<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody is then added together with NGF to the wells having the<br>
adherent cells, such that the tyrosine kinase receptor (e.g. TrkA receptor) is exposed to (or<br>
contacted with) NGF and the analyte. This assay enables identification of antibodies that<br>
inhibit activation of TrkA by its liganc NGF. Following exposure to NGF and the analyte,<br>
the adhering cells are solubilized using a lysis buffer (which has a solubilizing detergent<br>
therein) and gentle agitation, thereby releasing cell lysate which can be subjected to the<br>
ELISA part of the assay directly, without the need for concentration or clarification of the<br>
cell lysate.<br>
[0289]	The cell lysate thus prepared is then ready to be subjected to the ELISA<br>
stage of the assay. As a first step in the ELISA stage, a second solid phase (usually a well<br>
of an ELISA microtiter plate) is coated with a capture agent (often a capture antibody)<br>
which binds specifically to the tyrosine kinase receptor, or, in the case of a receptor<br>
construct, to the flag polypeptide. Coaling of the second solid phase is carried out so that<br><br>
the capture agent adheres to the second solid phase. The capture agent is generally a<br>
monoclonal antibody, but, as is described in the examples herein, polyclonal antibodies<br>
may also be used. The cell lysate obtained is then exposed to, or contacted with, the<br>
adhering capture agent so that the receptor or receptor construct adheres to (or is captured<br>
in) the second solid phase. A washing step is then carried out, so as to remove unbound<br>
cell lysate, leaving the captured receptor or receptor construct. The adhering or captured<br>
receptor or receptor construct is then exposed to or contacted with, an anti-<br>
phosphotyrosine antibody which identifies phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the tyrosine<br>
kinase receptor. In one embodiment, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody is conjugated<br>
(directly or indirectly) to an enzyme which catalyses a color change of a non-radioactive<br>
color reagent. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the receptor can be measured by a<br>
subsequent color change of the reagent. The enzyme can be bound to the anti-<br>
phosphotyrosine antibody directly, or a conjugating molecule (e.g., biotin) can be<br>
conjugated to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and the enzyme can be subsequently<br>
bound to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody via the conjugating molecule. Finally, binding<br>
of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to the captured receptor or receptor construct is<br>
measured, e.g., by a color change in the color reagent.<br>
[0290]	The anti-NGF antagonist antibody can also be identified by incubating a<br>
candidate agent with NGF and monitoring any one or more of the following characteristics:<br>
(a) binding to NGF and inhibiting NGF biological activity or downstream pathways<br>
mediated by NGF signaling function; (b) inhibiting, blocking or decreasing NGF receptor<br>
activation (including TrkA dimerization and/or autophosphorylation); (c) increasing<br>
clearance of NGF; (d) treating or preventing any aspect of rheumatoid arthritis pain or<br>
osteoarthritis pain; (e) inhibiting (reducing) NGF synthesis, production or release. In some<br>
embodiments, an anti-NGF antagonist antibody is identified by incubating an candidate<br>
agent with NGF and monitoring binding and/or attendant reduction or neutralization of a<br>
biological activity of NGF. The binding assay may be performed with purified NGF<br>
polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, NGF<br>
polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay,<br>
where the ability of a candidate antibcdy to compete with a known anti-NGF antagonist for<br>
NGF binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the<br>
ELISA format. In other embodiments, an anti-NGF antagonist antibody is identified by<br><br>
incubating a candidate agent with NGF and monitoring binding and attendant inhibition of<br>
trkA receptor dimerization and/or autophosphorylation.<br>
[0291]	Following initial identification, the activity of a candidate anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody can be further confirmed and refined by bioassays, known to test the<br>
targeted biological activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to screen candidates<br>
directly. For example, NGF promotes a number of morphologically recognizable changes<br>
in responsive cells. These include, but are not limited to, promoting the differentiation of<br>
PC 12 cells and enhancing the growth of neurites from these cells (Greene et al., Proc Natl<br>
Acad Sci USA. 73(7):2424-8,1976, promoting neurite outgrowth from explants of<br>
responsive sensory and sympathetic ganglia (Levi-Montalcini, R. and Angeletti, P. Nerve<br>
growth factor. Physiol. Rev. 48:534-f 69,1968) and promoting the survival of NGF<br>
dependent neurons such as embryonic dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, or<br>
sympathetic ganglion neurons (e.g., Chun &amp; Patterson, Dev. Biol. 75:705-711, (1977);<br>
Buchman &amp; Davies, Development 118:989-1001 (1993). Thus, the assay for inhibition of<br>
NGF biological activity entail culturing NGF responsive cells with NGF plus an analyte,<br>
such as a candidate anti-NGF antagonist antibody. After an appropriate time the cell<br>
response will be assayed (cell differer tiation, neurite outgrowth or cell survival).<br>
[0292]	The ability of a candidate anti-NGF antagonist antibody to block or<br>
neutralize a biological activity of NGF can also be assessed by monitoring the ability of the<br>
candidate agent to inhibit NGF mediated survival in the embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia<br>
survival bioassay as described in Hongo et al, Hybridoma 19:215-227 (2000).<br>
Administration of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody<br>
[0293]	The anti-NGF antagonist antibody can be administered to an individual (for<br>
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis) via any suitable route. It should be apparent to a<br>
person skilled in the art that the examples described herein are not intended to be limiting<br>
but to be illustrative of the techniques available. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody is admir istered to a individual in accord with known<br>
methods, such as intravenous administ ation, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over<br>
a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerebrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-<br>
articular, sublingually, intrasynovial, v a insufflation, intrathecal, oral, inhalation or topical<br>
routes. Administration can be systemic, e.g., intravenous administration, or localized.<br><br>
Commercially available nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and<br>
ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid formulations can be directly<br>
nebulized and lyophilized powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody can be aerosolized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a<br>
metered dose inhaler, or inhaled as a yophilized and milled powder.<br>
[0294]	In one embodiment, an anti-NGF antagonist antibody is administered via<br>
site-specific or targeted local delivery techniques. Examples of site-specific or targeted<br>
local delivery techniques include various implantable depot sources of the anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody or local delivery catheters, such as infusion catheters, an indwelling<br>
catheter, or a needle catheter, synthetic grafts, adventitial wraps, shunts and stents or other<br>
implantable devices, site specific carriers, direct injection, or direct application. See, e.g.,<br>
PCT Publication No. WO 00/53211 and U.S. Patent No. 5,981,568.<br>
[02951	Various formulations of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be used for<br>
administration. In some embodiments, the anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be<br>
administered neat. In some embodiments, anti-NGF antagonist antibody and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipienc may be in various formulations. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients are known in the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate<br>
administration of a pharmacologically effective substance. For example, an excipient can<br>
give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited<br>
to stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolarity,<br>
encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as<br>
formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in Remington, The<br>
Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20 h Ed. Mack Publishing (2000).<br>
[0296]	In some embodiments these agents are formulated for administration by<br>
injection (e.g., intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, etc.).<br>
Accordingly, these agents can be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such<br>
as saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and the like. The particular dosage regimen,<br>
i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will depend on the particular individual and that<br>
individual's medical history.<br>
[0297]	An anti-NGF antibod) can be administered using any suitable method,<br>
including by injection (e.g., intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, etc.). Anti-NGF ant bodies can also be administered via inhalation, as<br><br>
described herein. Generally, for administration of anti-NGF antibodies, an initial candidate<br>
dosage can be about 2 mg/kg. For the purpose, of the present invention, a typical daily<br>
dosage might range from about any of 1 µg/kg to 3 µg/kg to 30 µg/kg to 300 µg/kg to 3<br>
mg/kg, to 30 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For<br>
example, an anti-NGF antibody may be administered at about 1 µg/kg, about 10 µg/kg,<br>
about 20 µg/kg, about 50 µg/kg, about 100 fig/kg, about 200 µg/kg, about 500 µg/kg, about<br>
1 mg/kg, or about 2 mg/kg. For repeated administrations over several days or longer,<br>
depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of<br>
symptoms occurs or until sufficient therapeutic levels are achieved to reduce pain. An<br>
exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial dose of about 2 mg/kg,<br>
followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg of the anti-NGF antibody, or<br>
followed by a maintenance dose of atout 1 mg/kg every other week. However, other<br>
dosage regimens may be useful, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the<br>
practitioner wishes to achieve. For example, in some embodiments, dosing from one-four<br>
times a week is contemplated. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by<br>
conventional techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the NGF antagonist(s)<br>
used) can vary over time.<br>
[0298]	For the purpose of the present invention, the appropriate dosage of an anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody will depend on the anti-NGF antagonist antibody (or<br>
compositions thereof) employed, the type and severity of the pain to be treated, whether the<br>
agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's<br>
clinical history and response to the agent, and the discretion of the attending physician.<br>
Typically the clinician will administer an anti-NGF antagonist antibody, until a dosage is<br>
reached that achieves the desired result. Dose arid/or frequency can vary over course of<br>
treatment.<br>
[02991	Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to<br>
the determination of the dosage. For ekample, antibodies that are compatible with the<br>
human immune system, such as human bed antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be<br>
used to prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the antibody being attacked by the<br>
host's immune system. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over<br>
the course of therapy, and is generally, out not necessarily, based on treatment and/or<br>
suppression and/or amelioration and/or delay of pain. Alternatively, sustained continuous<br><br>
release formulations of anti-NGF antagonist antibodies may be appropriate. Various<br>
formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known in the art.<br>
[0300]	In one embodiment, dosages for an anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be<br>
determined empirically in individuals who have been given one or more administration(s)<br>
of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody. Individuals are given incremental dosages of an anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody. To assess efficacy of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody, an<br>
indicator of pain can be followed.<br>
[0301]	Administration of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody in accordance with the<br>
method in the present invention can be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example,<br>
upon the recipient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the administration is<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled practitioners. The<br>
administration of an anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be essentially continuous over a<br>
preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced dose, e.g., either before, during,<br>
or after developing pain; before; during; before and after; during and after; before and<br>
during; or before, during, and after developing pain.<br>
[0302]	In some embodiments, more than one anti-NGF antagonist antibody may be<br>
present. At least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five different, or more<br>
anti-NGF antagonist antibody can be present. Generally, those anti-NGF antagonist<br>
antibodies have complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other.<br>
[0303]	Therapeutic formulaticns of the anti-NGF antagonist antibody used in<br>
accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody<br>
having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
excipients or stabilizers (Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack<br>
Publishing (2000)), in the form of lyo philized formulations or aqueous solutions.<br>
Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed, and may co uprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other<br>
organic acids; salts such as sodium chloride; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and<br>
methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride;<br>
hexamethonium chloride; benzalkoninum chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or<br>
benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens, such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol;<br>
cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10<br>
residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins;<br><br>
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine,<br>
glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosacchandes, disaccharides, and<br>
other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as<br>
EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions<br>
such as sodium; metal complexes (e g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants<br>
such as TWEENTM, PLURONICSTM or polyethylene glycol (PEG).<br>
[0304]	Liposomes containing the anti-NGF antagonist antibody are prepared by<br>
methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
82:3688 (1985); Hwang, et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030 (1980); and U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse<br>
phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine,<br>
cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are<br>
extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.<br>
[0305]	The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for<br>
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate)<br>
microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes,<br>
albumin microspheres, microemulsiors, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in<br>
macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington, The Science and Practice of<br>
Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack Publishing (2000).<br>
[0306]	Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of<br>
sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic<br>
polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g.<br>
films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,<br>
hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or 'poly(v nylalcohol)),<br>
polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and 7 ethyl-L-<br>
glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid<br>
copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT TM (injectable microspheres composed of lactic<br>
acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolde acetate), sucrose acetate isobutyrate, and poly-<br>
D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.<br><br>
[0307]	The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This<br>
is readily accomplished by, for example, filtration through sterile filtration membranes.<br>
Therapeutic anti-NGF antagonist antibody compositions are generally placed into a<br>
container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial<br>
having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.<br>
[0308]	The compositions according to the present invention may be in unit dosage<br>
forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, solutions or suspensions, or<br>
suppositories, for oral, parenteral or rectal administration, or administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation.<br>
[0309]	For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active<br>
ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients<br>
such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate,<br>
dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid<br>
preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the<br>
present invention, or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring<br>
to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient<br>
is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily<br>
subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This<br>
solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type<br>
described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present<br>
invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,<br>
the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits<br>
the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety<br>
of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a<br>
number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac,<br>
cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0310]	Suitable surface-active agents include, in particular, non-ionic agents, such<br>
as polyoxyethylenesorbitans (e.g. TweenTM 20, 40, 60, 80 or 85) and other sorbitans (e.g.<br>
SpanTM 20,40, 60, 80 or 85). Compositions with a surface-active agent will conveniently<br><br>
comprise between 0.05 and 5% sunace-active agent, and can be between 0.1 and 2.5%. It<br>
will be appreciated that other ingredients may be added, for example mannitol or other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles, if necessary.<br>
[0311]	Suitable emulsions may be prepared using commercially available fat<br>
emulsions, such as IntralipidTM, LiposynTM, InfonutrolTM, LipofundinTM and<br>
LipiphysanTM. The active ingredient may be either dissolved in a pre-mixed emulsion<br>
composition or alternatively it may be dissolved in an oil (e.g. soybean oil, safflower oil,<br>
cottonseed oil, sesame oil, com oil or almond oil) and an emulsion formed upon mixing<br>
with a phospholipid (e.g. egg phospholipids, soybean phospholipids or soybean lecithin)<br>
and water. It will be appreciated that other ingredients may be added, for example gylcerol<br>
or glucose, to adjust the tonicity of the emulsion. Suitable emulsions will typically contain<br>
up to 20% oil, for example, between 5 and 20%. The fat emulsion can comprise fat<br>
droplets between 0.1 and 1.0 .µm, particularly 0.1 and 0.5 .µm, and have a pH in the range<br>
of5.5to8.0.<br>
[0312]	The emulsion composi tions can be those prepared by mixing a nerve growth<br>
factor antibody with IntralipidTM.or the components thereof (soybean oil, egg<br>
phospholipids, glycerol and water).<br>
[0313]	Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and<br>
suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures<br>
thereof, and powders. The liquid or sclid compositions may contain suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as set out above. In some embodiments, the<br>
compositions are administered by the cral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic<br>
effect. Compositions in preferably sterile pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be<br>
nebulised by use of gases. Nebulised solutions may be breathed directly from the<br>
nebulising device or the nebulising device may be attached to a face mask, tent or<br>
intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension or powder<br>
compositions may be administered, pre ferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver<br>
the formulation in an appropriate manner<br>
[0314]	Treatment efficacy can be assessed by methods well-known in the art.<br>

METHODS FOR ADJUSTING THE AFFINITY OF AN ANTIBODY AND<br>
METHODS FOR CHARACTERIZING A CDR<br>
[0318]	We have developed a novel method for characterizing a CDR of an antibody<br>
and/or altering (such as improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, such as an<br>
antibody, termed "library scanning mutagenesis". Generally, library scanning mutagenesis<br>
works as follows. One or more amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced with two or<br>
more (such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, 19, or 20) amino acids<br>
using art recognized methods. This generates small libraries of clones (in some<br>
embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity<br>
of two or more members (if two or more amino acids are substituted at every position).<br>
Generally, the library also includes a elone comprising the native (unsubstituted) amino<br>
acid. A small number of clones, e.g., about 20-80 clones (depending on the complexity of<br>
the library), from each library are screened for binding affinity to the target polypeptide,<br><br>
and candidates with increased, the same, decreased or no binding are identified. Methods<br>
for determining binding affinity are well-known in the art. In some embodiments, binding<br>
affinity is determined using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analysis, which detects<br>
differences in binding affinity of about 2-fold or greater. BIAcore is particularly useful<br>
when the starting antibody already binds with a relatively high affinity, for example a KD of<br>
about 10 nM or lower. Screening using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance is described in<br>
the Examples, herein.<br>
 [0319]	In other embodiments, binding affinity is determined using Kinexa<br>
 Biocensor, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN immunoassay (IGEN),<br>
fluorescence quenching, fluorescence transfer, and/or yeast display. In other embodiments,<br>
binding affinity is screened using a suitable bioassay.<br>
[0320]	In some embodiments, every amino acid position in a CDR is replaced (in<br>
some embodiments, one at a time) with all 20 natural amino acids using art recognized<br>
mutagenesis methods (some of which are described herein). This generates small libraries<br>
of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each<br>
with a complexity of 20 members (if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every position).<br>
[0321J	In some embodiments, the library to be screened comprises substitutions in<br>
two or more positions, which may be in the same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, in<br>
some embodiments, the library comprises substitutions in two or more positions in one<br>
CDR. In other embodiments, the library comprises substitution in two or more positions in<br>
two or more CDRs. In still other em x)diments, the library comprises substitution in 3, 4, 5,<br>
or more positions, said positions found in two, three, four, five or six CDRs. In some<br>
embodiments, the substitution is prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e.g., Table 2<br>
of Balint et al., (1993) Gene 137(1): 109-18).<br>
[0322]	In some embodiments, the CDR is CDRH3 and/or CDRL3. In other<br>
embodiments, the CDR is one or more of CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1, CDRH2,<br>
and/or CDRH3. In some embodimente, the CDR is a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or an<br>
extended CDR.<br>
[0323]	Candidates with improved binding may be sequenced, thereby identifying a<br>
CDR substitution mutant which resuks in improved affinity (also termed an "improved"<br>
substitution). For example, as demor strated in Example 1, use of this method permitted<br>
identification of a single substitution which improved binding, even when an estimated 18<br><br>
other substitutions at the same amino acid position resulted in no binding (i.e., loss of<br>
antibody function). Candidates that bind may also be sequenced, thereby identifying a<br>
CDR substitution which retains binding.<br>
[0324]	In some embodiments, multiple rounds of screening are conducted. For<br>
example, candidates (each comprising an amino acid substitution at one or more position of<br>
one or more CDR) with improved binding are also useful for the design of a second library<br>
containing at least the original and substituted amino acid at each improved CDR position<br>
(i.e., amino acid position in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved<br>
binding). Preparation, and screening or selection of this library is discussed further below.<br>
[0325]	Library scanning rr utageneis also provides a means for characterizing a<br>
CDR, in so far as the frequency of clones with improved binding, the same binding,<br>
decreased binding or no binding also provide information relating to the importance of each<br>
amino acid position for the stability of the antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a<br>
position of the CDR retains binding when changed to all 20 amino acids, that position is<br>
identified as a position that is unhkely to be required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a<br>
position of CDR retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions, that position is<br>
identified as a position that is important to CDR function. Thus, the library scanning<br>
mutagenesis methods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs that can be<br>
changed to many different amino acid (including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the<br>
CDRs which cannot be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino acids. This<br>
aspect is discussed and exemplified in Example 1.<br>
[0326]	In some embodiments, candidates with improved affinity are combined in a<br>
second library, which includes the improved amino acid, the original amino acid at that<br>
position, and may further include additional substitutions at that position, depending on the<br>
complexity of the library that is desired, or permitted using the desired screening or<br>
selection method. In addition, if desired, adjacent amino acid position can be randomized<br>
to at least two or more amino ac ds. Randomization of adjacent amino acids may permit<br>
additional conformational flexibility in the mutant CDR, which may in turn, permit or<br>
facilitate the introduction of a la ger number of improving mutations. In some<br>
embodiments, the library also comprises substitution at positions that did not show<br>
improved affinity in the first round of screening.<br><br>
[0327]	The second library is screened or selected for library members with<br>
improved and/or altered binding affinity using any method known in the art, including<br>
screening using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using any<br>
method known in the art for selection including phage display, yeast display, and ribosome<br>
display.<br>
Advantages of the methods for adjusting the affinity of an antibody and characterizing a<br>
CDR<br>
[0328]	The methods are userul for pre-screening CDR amino acid positions in order<br>
to identify amino acid substitutions that improve binding or retain binding. Pre-<br>
identification of important residues, substitution that improve binding and/or substitutions<br>
that retain antibody function permits efficient design and screening of an affinity<br>
maturation library.<br>
[0329]	The present method is also useful for characterizing a CDR, and provides<br>
comprehensive information regarding the importance of each amino acid position in a CDR<br>
for binding to antigen. The present method may also be used to identify substitutions that<br>
improve binding.<br>
[0330]	The use of small libratis, in which each position may be randomized (in<br>
some embodiments, one at a time), permits screening of substitution mutants using<br>
sensitive methods such as BIAcore which provide detailed kinetic information. Screening<br>
methods are generally impractical when larger libraries are screened. Instead, selection<br>
methods, such as phage display, yeas display, and ribosome display, are commonly used to<br>
identify clones that retain binding. Phage display and ELISA assays may depend heavily<br>
on the concentration of the protein sample prepared from the clone, and thus tend to be<br>
heavily biased towards clones that have increased expression, increased stability, or<br>
decreased toxicity, rather than identifying clones with increased binding affinity. In<br>
addition, differences in expression level of the clones may mask small improvements in<br>
binding affinity. These disadvantages are particularly acute when an antibody with high<br>
binding affinity is used as the starting material, because very low levels of antigen must be<br>
used in order for screening to be sufficiently stringent.<br>
[0331]	By contrast, the methods of the invention, such as randomization at each<br>
position (in some embodiments, one position at a time), permits introduction and<br><br>
characterization of the effect of the substitution of, for example, all 20 amino acids at a<br>
given position. This analysis provides information as to how many substitutions at a given<br>
position are tolerated (i.e., retain antibody binding), which in turn, provides information<br>
relating to the importance of each amino acid for antibody function. Further, substitutions<br>
that result in improved binding can be identified, even under circumstances in which many<br>
or most of the substitutions at a giver position yield non-functional (non-binding)<br>
antibodies. By contrast, alanine-scanning mutagenesis, which is commonly used to identify<br>
important CDR positions, provides ir formation relating to whether the substitution of<br>
alanine permits or prevents binding. Generally, positions at which an alanine substitution<br>
prevents binding are removed from the affinity maturation library. In many cases,<br>
however, alanine may be a poor substitute at the CDR position.<br>
[0332]	The present methods also permit identification and characterization of the<br>
effect of single GDR mutations. By contrast, methods such as phage display introduce and<br>
select many mutations simultaneously, and thus potentially increase the risk that positive<br>
mutations will be masked by the presence of a detrimental mutation present in a particular<br>
clone.<br>
[0333]	The present methods are also useful for improving affinity while retaining<br>
the binding specificity of the original (starting) antibody, insofar as the present methods<br>
permit identification of small numbers of mutations (e.g., 1, 2, 3,4, or 5 mutations in a<br>
single CDR) that result in improved binding affinity. By contrast, methods such as phage<br>
display typically improve binding aff nity using multiple mutations at once, which may<br>
result in shifting specificity of the antibody and/or increasing undesirable cross-reactivity.<br>
[0334]	The following examples are provided to illustrate, but not to limit, the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Humanization and affinity maturation of mouse antagonist anti-NGF<br>
antibody 911<br>
A. General methods<br>
[0335]	The following general methods were used in this example.<br><br>
Library generation<br>
[0336]	Libraries were generate d by PCR cassette mutagenesis with degenerate<br>
oligonucleotides as described in Kay et al. (1996), Phage display of peptides and proteins :<br>
a laboratory manual, San Diego, Academic Press (see, pages pg 277-291). The doping<br>
codon NNK was used to randomize one amino acid position to include 20 possible amino<br>
acids. To randomize one amino acid position to include only a subset of amino acids with<br>
specific properties, doping codons we e used as described in Balint et al, (1993) Gene<br>
137(1):109-18). Site directed mutagenesis was performed using recombinant PCR as<br>
described in Innis et al, (1990) PCR p otocols: A guide to methods and applications (see,<br>
pp. 177-183).<br>
Small scale Fab preparation<br>
[0337]	Small scale expression in 96 wells plates was optimized for screening Fab<br>
libraries. Starting from E. coli transformed with a Fab library, colonies were picked to<br>
inoculate both a master plate (agar LB + Ampicillin (50 ug/ml) + 2% Glucose) and a<br>
working plate (2 ml/well, 96 well/plate containing 1.5 mL- of LB + Ampicillin (50 µg/ml) +<br>
2% Glucose). Both plates were grown at 30°C for 8-12 hours. The master plate was stored<br>
at 4°C and the cells from the working plate were pelleted at 5000 rpm and resuspended<br>
with 1 mL of LB+Ampicillin (50 µg/mi)+ 1 mM IPTG to induce expression of Fabs. Cells<br>
were harvested by centrifugation after 5 h expression time at 30°C, then resuspended in 500<br>
µL of buffer HBS-EP (100 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% P20, 3 mM<br>
EDTA). Lysis of HBS-EP resuspended cells was attained by one cycle of freezing (-80°C)<br>
then thawing at 37°C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to separate cell<br>
debris from supernatants containing Fabs. The supernatants were then injected into the<br>
BIAcore plasmon resonance apparatus to obtain affinity information for each Fab. Clones<br>
expressing Fabs were rescued from the master plate to sequence the DNA and for large<br>
scale Fab production and detailed characterization as described below.<br>
Large Scale Fab preparation<br>
[0338]	To obtain detailed kinetic parameters, Fabs were expressed and purified<br>
from large cultures. Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of LB+Ampicillin (50 µg/ml) +<br>
2% Glucose were inoculated with 5 mL of over night culture from a selected Fab-<br><br>
expressing E coli clone. Clones were incubated at 30°C until an OD500nm of 1.0 was<br>
attained and then induced by replacing the media for 200 ml, of LB+Ampicillin (50 µg/ml)<br>
+ 1 mM DPTG. After 5h expression time at 30°C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation,<br>
then resuspended in 10 mL PBS (pH 8). Lysis of the cells was obtained by two cycles of<br>
freeze/thaw (at -80°C and 37°C, respectively). Supernatant of the cell lysates were loaded<br>
onto Ni-NTA superflow sepharose (Qiagen, Valencia. CA) columns equilibrated with PBS,<br>
pH 8, then washed with 5 column volumes of PBS, pH 8. Individual Fabs eluted in<br>
different fractions with PBS (pH 8) 4 300 mM Imidazol. Fractions containing Fabs were<br>
pooled and dialized in PBS, then quantified by ELISA prior to affinity characterization.<br>
Full antibody preparation<br>
[0339]	For expression of full antibodies, heavy and light chain variable regions<br>
were cloned in 2 mammalian expression vectors (Eb.911 .E3 or u1.3E for light<br>
chain and Db.911.3E for heavy chain; described herein) and transfected using<br>
lipofectemine into HEK 293 cells for transient expression. Antibodies were purified using<br>
protein A using standard methods.<br>
Biacore Assay<br>
[0340]	Affinities of anti-NGF Fabs and monoclonal antibodies were determined<br>
using the BlAcore3000™ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system (BIAcore, INC,<br>
PiscawayNJ). CM5 chips were activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>
carbodiinide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the<br>
supplier's instructions. Human NGF was diluted into 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 and<br>
injected over the activated chip at a concentration of 0.005 mg/mL. Using variable flow<br>
time across the individual chip channels, two ranges of antigen density were achieved: 100-<br>
200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies and 500-600 RU for screening assays.<br>
The chip was blocked with ethanolamine. Regeneration studies showed that a mixture of<br>
Pierce elution buffer (Product No. 21004, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 4 M<br>
NaCl (2:1) effectively removed the bound Fab while keeping the activity of hNGF on the<br>
chip for over 200 injections. HBS-EP buffer (0..01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 NaCl, 3 mM<br>
EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P29) was used as running buffer for all the BIAcore assays.<br>
Screening assay<br><br>
[0341]	A screening BIAcore assay was optimized to determine the affinity of Fab<br>
clones from libraries. Supernatants of small culture lysates were injected at 50 µl/min for 2<br>
min. Dissociation times of 10 to 15 minutes were used for determination of a single<br>
exponential dissociation rate (koff) using BIAevaluation software. Samples that showed koff<br>
rates in the same range as the template used to create the library<br>
(clone 8L2-6D5, koff lxlO-3 s-1) were injected for confirmation and dissociation times of up<br>
to 45 min were allowed to obtain better koff values. Clones showing improved (slower) koff<br>
values were expressed at large scale and full kinetic parameters, kon and koff, were<br>
determined on purified protein. The assay was capable of detecting differences in affinity<br>
that were approximately 2-fold or larger.<br>
Affinity determination assay,<br>
[0342]	Serial dilutions (0.1 -10 x estimated KD) of purified Fab samples were<br>
injected for 1 min at 100 µL/min and dissociation times of up to 2h were allowed. The<br>
concentrations of the Fab proteins were determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE<br>
electrophoresis using as a standard a Fab of known concentration (as determined by amino<br>
acid analysis). Kinetic association rales (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) were obtained<br>
simultaneously by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H.<br>
Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. (1994). Methods Enzymology 6. 99-110) using the<br>
BlAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values were calculated as<br>
koff/Kon-<br>
B. Humanization and affinity naturation of mouse antagonist anti-NGF antibody<br>
911<br>
[0343]	The mouse antagonist anti-NGF antibody, 911 (see Hongo et al, (2000)<br>
Hybridoma 19(3):215-227) was selected for humanization and affinity maturation. Mab<br>
911 binds human and rat NGF with high affinity and exhibits no significant cross-reactivity<br>
with the neurotrophins NT3, NT4/5 ( or BDNF. See Hongo, id. The affinity of the papain-<br>
cleaved Fab fragment of mouse Mab 911 was determined using BIAcore analysis as<br>
described above. The papain-cleaved Fab fragment of mouse Mab 911 bound human NGF<br>
with a KD of approximately 10 nM.<br>
[0344]	Humanization and affinity maturation was conducted in several steps, as<br>
follows:<br><br>
[0345]	(1) Preparation of CDR-grafted template. The light chain extended CDRs<br>
of antibody 911 (i.e., including both the Kabat and Chothia CDR regions) were grafted into<br>
the human germline acceptor sequences 08 with JK2 and the heavy chain extended CDRs<br>
of antibody 911 were grafted in to human germline acceptor sequence VH4-59 with JH4.<br>
The amino acid sequences of the human germline acceptor sequences are shown in Figures<br>
1A and 1B. Amino acid numbering is sequential. Using the protein frameworks noted<br>
above, DNA sequences were designed for synthetic genes encoding human framework with<br>
the murine CDRs. These humanized heavy and light variable domains were termed hVH<br>
and hVL respectively. Codons were optimized for E. coli and hamster usage. Several<br>
overlapping oligonucleotides (69-90 bases in length) extending the full length of the hVL<br>
and hVH with two short flanking primers for each chain were used to separately synthesize<br>
the two genes by recursive PCR essentially as described in Prodromou et al, (1992) Protein<br>
Eng 5(8): 827-9. Resulting DNA fragments of the correct length were gel purified and then<br>
cloned into an E. coli bicistronic expression plasmid (ampicillin resistant). Expression of<br>
the antibodies was under control of an IPTG inducible IacZ promoter similar to that<br>
described in Barbas (2001) Phage dis play: a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (see Vector pComb3X, at pg 2.10), however,<br>
modifications included addition and expression of the following additional domains: the<br>
human Kappa light chain constant domain (see GenBank Accession No. CAA09181) and<br>
the CHI constant domain of IgG2a human immunoglobulin (GenBank Accession No.<br>
P01859).<br>
[0346]	The amino acid sequernces of the variable regions of the CDR-grafted<br>
antibody (also termed the "template") termed 8L2-4D5, are also shown in Figures 1A and<br>
1B. The affinity of 8L2-4D5 was determined using BIAcore analysis as described above.<br>
8L2-4D5 bound human NGF with a KD of approximately 38 nM.<br>
[03471	(2) Introduction of a point mutation into the framework sequence. The<br>
V71K substitution was introduced into me CDR-grafted heavy chain using recombinant<br>
PCR site directed mutagenesis as described in Innis et al, (1995) PCR strategies, San<br>
Diego, Academic Press. This substitu ion replaced the human framework residue with the<br>
corresponding mouse framework residue. The resulting antibody was termed 8L2-6D5,<br>
and the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain variable region of 8L2-6D5 is shown in<br>
Figure 1 A. The affinity of 8L2-6D5 was determined using BIAcore analysis as described<br><br>
above. The Fab fragment of 8L2-6D5 bound human NGF with a Kd of approximately 15<br>
nM. 8L2-6D5 was chosen as template for affinity maturation.<br>
[0348]	(3) Humanization and affinity maturation of CDRs L1, L2, H1 and H2.<br>
CDRs L1, L2, H1 and H2 were subjected to humanization and affinity maturation. Amino<br>
acid positions in CDRs L1, L2, H1, and H2 were identified that are not essential for the<br>
structure of the CDRs based on the Chothia canonical structure (see Al-Lazikani et al<br>
(1997)./. Mol Biol 273(4):927-48) and subjected to randomization as follows. Two<br>
libraries were prepared containing the light chain mutations or heavy chain mutations<br>
shown in Table 2, and the grafted (mouse) CDR L3 or CDR H3, respectively, using PCR<br>
cassette mutagenesis with degenerate oligonucleotides as described in Kay et al. (1996),<br>
Phage display of peptides and proteins : a laboratory manual. San Diego, Academic Press,<br>
using doping codons as described in Balint et al, (1993) Gene 137(1): 109-18). Generally,<br>
the amino acid residues were altered to residues that are more common in human<br>
antibodies, based on alignments of antibody 911 light chain and heavy chain amino acid<br>
sequences with human germline antibody sequences. The wildtype (unsubstituted) amino<br>
acid residue was also represented in the library with the exception of CDR H2 residue 50, a<br>
methionine, in which the wildtype methionine was not represented in the library.<br>
Methionine residues are subject to oxidation; thus, replacement of that residue was<br>
expected to improve stability of the lesulting antibody. The libraries of Fabs were cloned<br>
into vector pComb3X plus the human CH1 and CK regions, as described above.<br><br><br><br>
[0349]	For affinity screening experiments, each library was further paired with the<br>
corresponding CDR-grafted light or heavy chain (for example, the H1/H2 library was<br>
paired with CDR-grafted light chain), the antibody was expressed, and affinity to human<br>
NGF of the individual clones was screened using the BIACORE surface plasmon resonance<br>
(SPR) system (BIAcore, Inc. Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions<br>
and as described above, koff, kon and KD were determined. Antibody clones were ranked<br>
based on koff rates, since generally most variation in affinity is seen in koff rates, and further<br>
because koff rates are independent of mtibody concentration.<br>
[0350]	The sequence of clones that bound was determined and the sequence of<br>
clones that bound is shown in table 3.<br>
Table 3: L1 and L2 amino acid sequences, H1 and H2 amino acid sequences, and<br>
kinetic data for clones that bound following affinity screening of H1/H2 or L1/L2 library<br>
clones.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
CDR-L1: S26S (no change); D28S; H32N<br>
CDR-L2: Y50Y (no change); I51T; F54F (no change); S56S (no change)<br>
[0353]	These mutations were combined (by amplifying the H and L chains by PCR,<br>
cutting the PCR products and vector (pRN8) with restriction enzyme and performing a 3<br>
fragment ligation) into a single clone, termed H19-L129, which also included the grafted<br>
H3 and L3 CDRs. The sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of<br>
H19-L129 is shown in Figures 1A and 1B, and Table 4 shows the amino acid sequence of<br>
CDRs L1, L2, H1 and H2. H19-L129 bound NGF with a KD of approximately 1 nM, as<br>
determined using BIAcore analysis as described herein.<br><br>
[03541	(4) Affinity maturation of H3 and L3 CDRs. Affinity maturation of the<br>
H3 and L3 CDRs was carried out in two steps. First, in a process termed "library scanning<br>
mutagenesis", each amino acid residae in H3 and L3 was individually prescreened in order<br>
to identify amino acid positions at which a mutation resulted in increased binding affinity<br>
to human NGF. Based on the result; of the library scanning mutagenesis (also termed<br>
"small library randomization analysi'), a subset of amino acid positions in H3 and L3 were<br>
selected for preparation of the affinity maturation library, and the affinity maturation<br>
library was screened for affinity to human NGF using BIAcore analysis as described<br>
herein. It is appreciated that these techniques can be generally applied.<br><br>
(a) Library scanning muta genesis<br>
[03551	Each amino acid position in the H3 and L3 CDRs was individually pre-<br>
screened for substitutions which resulted in increased binding affinity to human NGF. The<br>
frequency of amino acid substitutions at any given position that resulted in improved<br>
binding, the same binding, worse binding or no binding provided information relating to<br>
relating to positions in the CDRs that can be changed to many different amino acid<br>
(including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot be changed or<br>
which can only be changed to a few amino acids. Amino acid substitutions resulting in<br>
increased binding affinity were also identified. Based on the results of this screening, a<br>
subset of amino acid positions in CDRs H3 and L3 were selected for preparation of an<br>
affinity maturation library.<br>
[0356]	Individual Fab librar es were prepared in which each amino acid of L3 and<br>
H3 CDRs was randomized to all 20 amino acids, one at a time, resulting in several (5<br>
libraries for the light chain and 13 libraries for the heavy chain) small libraries, each with a<br>
complexity of 20 amino acid possib lities at each amino acid position. In all cases, the<br>
native (i.e., unchanged) amino acid was represented in the library. Libraries were prepared<br>
by PCR cassette mutagenesis with degenerate oligonucleotides as described in Kay et al.<br>
(1996), Phage display of Peptides and Proteins: a laboratory manual, San Diego,<br>
Academic Press, using the doping codon NNK to randomize one amino acid position to<br>
include 20 possible amino acids. The 8L2-6D5 (the CDR grafted antibody, having the<br>
framework mutation V71K) served as the template for library construction because the<br>
lower affinity of the CDR grafted ar tibody peimitted easier detection of differences in<br>
affinity in H3 and L3 mutants during screening. Thus, each member of a library contained<br>
a CDR3 (either H3 or L3) with one amino acid substitution, and 5 grafted CDRs.<br>
[0357]	20-80 clones from each small library were screened using BIAcore analysis<br>
as described herein. Samples were simultaneously analyzed by BIAcore for binding<br>
affinity to NGF in one channel of the BIAcore chip and for presence of Fab by binding to a<br>
penta-histag antibody in another channel of the sensor chip, to detect the his tag at the C<br>
terminus of the heavy chain. Clones that expressed protein were classified as having the<br>
same affinity, worse affinity, better. affinity or no binding, using koff to classify: The<br>
results of this analysis are shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
[0358]	The sequence of all clones with improved affinity was determined, revealing<br>
the frequency and identity of amino acid substitutions that resulted in increased affinity. In<br>
addition, a few clones that retained an affinity similar to the 812-6D5 clone were selected<br>
from each library, in order to ascertain amino acid sequence substitutions that were<br>
permitted at a given position, even though the substitution did not necessarily increase<br>
binding affinity. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 6.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0359]	Several mutations resulted in increased binding affinity. At least the<br>
following mutations resulted in significantly increased binding affinity as compared with<br>
the 8L2-6D5 template: (H_Y10 W (CDR sequence GGYWYGTSYYFDY (SEQ ID<br>
NO:46)); H_S105A (CDR sequence GGYYYGTAYYFDY (SEQ ID NO:47)); H_S105T<br>
(CDR sequence GGYYYGTTY Y FDY (SEQ ID NO:48)); H_G103A (CDR sequence<br>
GGYYYATSYYFDY (SEQ ID NO:49); and L_S91E (CDR sequence QQEKTLPYT<br>
(SEQ ID NO:50)).<br>
[0360]	The results of this experiment were used to guide selection of amino acid<br>
positions for generation of the affinity maturation libraries.<br><br>
[0361]	This experiment also provided information regarding the frequency of<br>
amino acid substitutions at any given position that resulted in improved binding, the same<br>
binding, worse binding or no binding, as shown in Table 5. This information permitted<br>
identification of amino acid positions in the CDRs that could be changed to many different<br>
amino acid (including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which could be<br>
changed to a few amino acids or a very few amino acids (in some embodiments, no amino<br>
acids). These results also demorstrated amino acid substitutions that increased binding<br>
affinity.<br>
(b) Affinity maturation<br>
[0362]	Next, the results of the small library randomization analysis (above) were<br>
used to select residues for production of the H3 and L3 libraries for affinity maturation of<br>
the H3 and L3 CDRs. Residues Y101 and G103 of CDR H3 and residues S91 and K92 of<br>
CDRL3 were selected for production of the H3 and L3 libraries for affinity maturation of<br>
the H3 and L3 CDRs.<br>
[0363]	This library combined mutations in H3 and L3 at the same time in CDR-<br>
graftcd clone 8L2-6D5, and separately in the background of H19-L129, and had a diversity<br>
of 80 different clones. Table 7 shows the amino acid residues selected for substitution and<br>
the amino acids that were substituted at each position.<br>
Table 7. Amino acid residues in H3 and L3 selected for substitution and the amino<br>
acids that were substituted at eacn position<br>
CDR-H3:<br>
Y101 was changed to Y and W, C. (Note that C was included because use of<br>
codon TRS in one degenerated oligonucleotide also generated codon C).<br>
G103 was changed to A ,P, S<br>
CDR-L3:<br>
S91was changed 10 E.<br>
K92 was changed to all twenty amino acids. A, R, K, and H bound.<br>
[0364]	Each polypeptide was expressed as a Fab, and affinity to human NGF of 96<br>
individual clones was screened for each library using BIACORE analysis according to the<br><br><br><br><br>
[0365]	Based on binding affinity, the best clones, E3 (interchangeably termed "3E")<br>
and 3C, were selected for further characterization. E3 comprised the following CDR<br>
substitutions: CDR-H3: Y101W, G103A; and CDR-L3: S91E, K92H, which were<br>
combined into a single clone which also included the following L1, L2, H1 and H2<br>
mutations:<br>
CDR-H1:I34L:<br>
CDR-H2: M50I: L63V:<br>
CDR-L1:D28S:H32N:<br>
CDR-L2: I51T.<br>
The sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of E3 is shown in Figures<br>
1A and 1B. 3C comprised the following CDR substitutions: CDR-L3: S91E; K92R;<br>
CDRH3: Y101W; G103A, which were combined into a single clone which also included<br>
the LI, L2, H1 and H2 mutations described for clone 3E.<br>
[0366]	3E and 3C sequenc es were cloned into mammalian expression vectors for<br>
production of Fab and full antiboc y, and expressed in HEK293 cells and purified using Ni-<br>
NTA or protein A chromatographv. Pure protein was accurately quantified by amino acid<br>
analysis.<br>
[0367]	The binding affinit es to human NGF of Fabs E3 and 3C were measured<br>
using BIAcore analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described<br>
above, except that 100 RU NGF was used on chip to prevent a rebinding effect. Briefly,<br>
several concentrations of antibodies (Fabs) were injected for 2 minutes onto a CM5 chip<br>
with 100 RU of immobilized human NGF on it, and permitted to dissociate for 1800<br><br>
seconds. Mouse antibody 911 (Fab) was analyzed as a control. Data was analyzed using<br>
BIAevaluation software following the manufacturer's instructions. The results of the<br>
analysis of antibody E3 and 911 are shown in Figures 9 and 10. E3 bound human NGF<br>
with a KD of approximately 0.07 nM (and with a kon of about 6.0e5 M-ls-1, and a koff of<br>
about 4.2e-5 s-1). 3C bound human NGF with a KD of approximately 0.35 nM (with a koff<br>
of about 1.4E-5). By contrast, mouse antibody 911 bound NGF with a KD of 3.7 nM, koff<br>
of 8.4x10V and kon of 2.2xl04Ms-1.<br>
[0368]	Antibody E3 (interchangeably termed 3E) was selected for further analysis<br>
based on the high binding affinity. To test the ability of E3 to prevent the interaction of<br>
NGF with the NGF receptors trkA and p75,2.5 nM of human NGF was premixed and<br>
incubated for one hour with 0 to 50 oM of antibody E3 (Fab). After the incubation,<br>
samples were injected at 10 ul/minute on a BIAcore CM5 chip containing 260 RU of p75<br>
(channel 2) and 600 RU of trkA (channel 3), and percent binding was determined. The<br>
results of this analysis are shown in Figure 11. Increased concentrations of Fab E3 blocked<br>
the interaction of NGF with both p75 and trkA, as shown by decreased signal (measured in<br>
RU), indicating that Fab E3 blocks the interaction of human NGF with both trkA and p75.<br>
When antibody E3 (Fab) concent ation equaled NGF concentration (at about 2.5 nM NGF<br>
concentration), no NGF binding was observed (as shown by a signal of zero). The fact that<br>
zero percent NGF-receptor binding occurred when concentration of NGF was equal to<br>
antibody 3E concentration suggested that 2.5 nM NGF was at least ten-fold higher than the<br>
kD of E3 for NGF and at equilibtium.<br>
Example 2: evaluation of NGF-blocking ability of anti-NGF antibodies using mouse<br>
El3.5 trigeminal neuron survival assay<br>
[0369]	The ability of Fat H3 or full antibody E3 to block NGF activity was<br>
evaluated by measurement of the capacity of the antibody to inhibit NGF-dependent<br>
survival of mouse E13.5 trigeminal neurons in vitro. The trigeminal ganglion is comprised<br>
of cutaneous sensory neurons that innervate the facial region. The survival of mouse El 3.5<br>
trigeminal neurons is a sensitive assay to evaluate the NGF-blocking activity of anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibodies because NGF is required to support survival of these neurons. For<br>
example, at saturating concentrations of NGF, the survival is close to 100% by 48 hours in<br>
culture. By contrast, less than 5% of the meurons survive by 48 hours in absence of NGF.<br><br>
[0370]	The survival assay was conducted as follows: time-mated pregnant Swiss<br>
Webster female mice were euthanised by C02 inhalation. The uterine horns were removed<br>
and the embryos at embryonic stage El 3.5 were extracted and decapitated. The trigeminal<br>
ganglia were dissected using electrolytically sharpened tungsten needles. The ganglia were<br>
then trypsinized, mechanically dissociated and plated at a density of 200-300 cells per well<br>
in defined, serum-free medium in 96-well plates coated with poly-L-ornithine and laminin.<br>
[0371]	The blocking actvity of anti -NGF Fabs or antibodies was assessed by<br>
adding to the trigeminal neurons varying doses of anti-NGF antibodies Mab 911 (Fab),<br>
8L2-6D5; H19-L129; E3 and 3C: and human or rat NGF at the following concentrations:<br>
0.4 ng/ml (~15 pM; this concentration represented a saturating concentration of NGF for<br>
survival) and 0.04 ng/ml (~1.5 pM; this concentration is around the IC50). After 48 hours<br>
in culture, the cells were subjected to an automated immunocytochemistry protocol<br>
performed on a Biomek FX liquid handling workstation (Beckman Coulter) as follows:<br>
fixation using 4% formaldehyde, 5% sucrose, and PBS; permeabilization using 0.3% Triton<br>
X-100 in PBS); blocking of unspecific binding sites using 5% normal goat serum, 0.11%<br>
BSA in PBS; and sequential incu ration with a primary and secondary antibodies to detect<br>
neurons. The primary antibody vas rabbit polyclonal antibody against the protein gene<br>
product 89.5 (PGP9.5, Chemicon), an established neuronal phenotypic marker. The<br>
secondary antibody was Alexa Flaor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), together with<br>
the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) to label the nuclei of all the cells<br>
present in the culture. Image acquisition and image analysis were performed on a<br>
Discovery-I/GenII Imager (Unive rsal Imaging Corporation). Images were automatically<br>
acquired at two wavelengths for Aexa Fluor 488 and Hoechst 33342, with the nuclear<br>
staining being used as reference point for the image-based auto-focus system of the Imager,<br>
since nuclear staining is present in all of the wells. Appropriate objectives and number of<br>
sites imaged per well were selected to cover the entire surface of each well. Automated<br>
image analysis was set up to count the number of neurons present in each well after 48<br>
hours in culture based on their specific staining with the anti-PGP9.5 antibody. Careful<br>
thresholding of the image and application of morphology and fluorescence intensity based<br>
selectivity filter resulted in an accurate count of neurons per well.<br>
[0372]	The results of this experiment demonstrated that Fab E3 blocked NGF<br>
activity with a high affinity. The results are shown in Figures 4-6, and Table 9.<br><br>
[0373]	Figure 4 is a graph showing NGF-dependent survival of E13.5 neurons in<br>
the presence of varying concentration of human and rat NGF.<br>
[0374]	Figure 5 is a graph comparing the NGF blocking effect of various Fabs in<br>
the presence of either 0.04 ng/ml of human NGF (approximately 1.5 pM; shown in the<br>
lower panel) or 0.4 ng/ml human NGF (approximately 15 pM; shown in the upper panel).<br>
1.5 pM of NGF was around the EC 50 of NGF promoting survival, while 15 pM represented<br>
a saturating concentration of NGF. Survival of E13.5 mouse trigeminal neurons in various<br>
concentrations of Fab E3; murine 011 Fab; and Fab H19-L129 and Fab 8L2-6D5 was<br>
assessed as described above. The [C50 (in pM) was calculated for each Fab at each NGF<br>
concentration, and is shown in Table 9. Fab E3 strongly blocked human NGF-dependent<br>
trigeminal neuron survival, with an IC50 of approximately 21 pM in the presence of 15 pM<br>
human NGF, and an IC50 of approximately 1.2 pM in the presence of 1.5 pM human NGF.<br>
Fabs 3C and H19-L129 also strongly blocked human NGF-dependent trigeminal neuron<br>
survival.<br>
[0375]	Figure 6 is a graph comparing the NGF blocking effect of various Fabs in<br>
the presence of either 0.04 ng/ml of rat NGF (approximately 1.5 pM; shown in the lower<br>
panel) or 0.4 ng/ml rat NGF (app oximately 15 pM; shown in the upper panel). 1.5 pM of<br>
NGF was around the EC50, while 15 pM represented a saturating concentration of NGF.<br>
Survival of E13.5 mouse trigeminal neurons in various concentrations of Fab E3; murine<br>
Fab 911; and Fab H19-L129 and 8L2-6D5 was assessed as described above. The EC50 (in<br>
pM) was calculated for each Fab at each NGF concentration, and is shown in Table 9. Fab<br>
E3 strongly blocked human NGF -dependent trigeminal neuron survival, with an IC50 of<br>
approximately 31.6 pM in the presence of 15 pM ratNGF, and an IC50 of approximately<br>
1.3 pM in the presence of 1.5 pM rat NGF. Fabs 3 C and H19-L129 also strongly blocked<br>
rat NGF-dependent trigeminal n neuron survival.<br><br><br><br>
[0376]	In a different experiment, we compared the ability of full antibody E3 and<br>
Fab 3E to inhibit NGF-dependent survival of E13.5 neurons in the presence of 0.4 ng/ml<br>
(saturating concentration) of human NGF. The results of the analysis are shown in Figure<br>
12. Full antibody E3 and Fab 3E showed similar levels of inhibition of NGF-dependent<br>
survival when the concentration of whole antibody and Fab were normalized to the number<br>
of NGF binding sites (Fab has one binding site and whole antibody has two binding sites).<br>
These results demonstrated that there was no avidity effect due to the binding of a full<br>
antibody to the NGF dimer.<br>
[0377]	In another experimer ts, we compared the ability of various concentrations<br>
(20,4,0.8, 0.16, 0.032, 0.0064, 0.0C 128, and 0.0 nM) of antibody E3, antibody 911, and a<br>
trkA receptor immunadhesin (consisting of the extracellular domain of the NGF receptor<br>
trkA fused with the immunoglobulin Fc domain, CH2-CH3) to inhibit NGF-dependent<br>
survival of El 3.5 neurons in the presence of 0.4 ng/ml (saturating conditions). These<br>
results are shown in Figure 13. These results demonstrated that antibody E3 blocked NGF<br>
better than either antibody 911 or the trkA immunoadhesin.<br>
Example 3: Evaluation of the specificity of anti-NGF antibody E3 using mouse trigeminal<br>
and nodose neuron survival assays<br><br>
[0378]	The ability of antibody E3 to specifically block NGF activity was evaluated<br>
by measurement of the capacity of the antibody to inhibit survival of mouse E17/18<br>
trigeminal neurons in vitro in the presence of saturating concentrations of NGF, the NGF-<br>
related neurotrophin NT3, or the NGF- Inrelated neurotrophic factor, macrophage<br>
stimulating protein (MSP). The survival of mouse El7/18 trigeminal neurons is a sensitive<br>
assay to evaluate the NGF-blocking activity of anti-NGF antagonist antibodies because<br>
NGF is required to support survival of these neurons at higher concentrations than the level'<br>
of NGF required to support survival of El3.5 TG neurons). Survival of these neurons is<br>
also supported by NT3 or MSP; therefore, the survival of these neurons is also a sensitive<br>
assay to evaluate whether the anti-NGF antagonist antibody also blocked NT3 or MSP.<br>
[0379]	The ability of antibody E3 to specifically block NGF activity was also<br>
evaluated by measurement of the capacity of the antibody to inhibit survival of mouse<br>
nodose El7 neurons in the presence of saturating concentrations of BDNF or NT4/5.<br>
Survival of nodose neurons is supported by BDNF or NT4/5; therefore, survival of these<br>
neurons is a sensitive assay to evaluate the BDNF or NT4/5-blocking ability of the anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody..<br>
[0380]	The survival assay was conducted as follows: time mated pregnant Swiss<br>
Webster female mice were euthanised by C02 inhalation. The uterine horns were removed<br>
and the embryos (at embryonic day 17 or 18) were extracted and decapitated. The<br>
trigeminal and nodose ganglia were dissected and cleaned. The ganglia were then<br>
trypsinised, mechanically dissociatec and plated at a density of 100-300 cells per well in<br>
defined, serum-free medium in 4-well plates (Greiner) coated with poly-L-ornithine and<br>
laminin.<br>
[0381]	E17/18 trigeminal neurons wen; grown either without added neurotrophic<br>
factors (negative control) or in the presence of saturating concentrations of human NGF<br>
(400pM and 15pM) (positive control); NT3 (400 pM); or MSP (600pM). Duplicate<br>
cultures were set up that included varying concentrations of E3 and 911 Fabs and full<br>
antibodies. Concentration of Fab and full antibodies was indicated per binding site (e.g., a<br>
full antibody contains two binding sites, while: a Fab contains one binding site).<br>
[0382]	El7 nodose neurons were grown either in the absence of added neurotrophic<br>
factors (negative control), or with s lturating concentrations of BDNF (400pM) (positive<br>
control) or NT4/5 (400pM) or NGP unrelated growth factor ILF (interleukin inhibitory<br><br>
factor). High concentrations of neurotrophins were used, as the goal of this experiment<br>
was to test specificity of the antibodies. Duplicate cultures were set up that included<br>
varying again with and without the addition of antibodies E3 and 911. After 48 hours in<br>
culture the total number of neurons surviving in each well under each condition was<br>
ascertained by manual counting using a phase-contrast microscope.<br>
[03831	The results of these experiments demonstrated that E3 and 911 antibodies<br>
completely blocked the survival promoting effects of NGF on El8 trigeminal neurons. By<br>
contrast, E3 and 911 antibodies had no effect on survival of trigeminal neurons promoted<br>
by NT3 or MSP, or survival of nodose neurons promoted by BDNF or NT4/5 or LIF.<br>
These results demonstrated that antibody E3 possessed selective specificity for NGF, as<br>
there was no detected interaction between these antibodies and other NGF related<br>
neurotrophins (NT3, NT4/5, BDNF) at concentrations 1000-fold to 10,000-fold higher than<br>
effective concentration for NGF blc eking. Further, these results demonstrated that the<br>
neuronal death seen in NGF-supplemented cultures of NGF-dependent neurons on addition<br>
of antibody or Fab E3 was due to a specific interaction between these antibodies and NGF<br>
and was not due to a generalized toxic effect. Mouse anti-NGF antagonist antibody 911<br>
was also tested, and similar results were observed. Note that due to the high concentrations<br>
of neurotrophins used, both antibodi E3 and 911 are very close to their titration conditions<br>
and were expected to bind NGF at similar levels because the differences in binding affinity<br>
of these antibodies to NGF would to be less apparent under these conditions.<br>
[0384]	The results of these experiments are shown in figures 14, 15,16, and 17.<br>
The data showed mean percent survival after 48 hours in culture (±standard error of mean,<br>
n=3 for each data point) relative to the survival seen in the positive control for each<br>
experiment (e.g., 100% survival of rigeminal neurons grown in the presence of saturating<br>
NGF concentration, and 100 % survival of nodose neurons grown in the presence of<br>
saturating BDNF concentration, respectively). Figures 14-15 are graphs showing that anti-<br>
NGF antagonist antibody E3 or Fab E3 did not inhibit the survival promoted by NT3, and<br>
MSP, even at antibody concentrations as high as 200 nM. By contrast, 20 nM of antibody<br>
E3 or Fab 3E and Fab 911 totally blocked NGF-elicited survival. Mouse anti-NGF<br>
antagonist antibody 911 was also tested, and similar results were observed. Specifically,<br>
Figure 14 is a graph showing comparison of the effect of various concentrations (20 nM, 2<br>
nM, or 0.2 nM) of E3 Fab (termed "3E" in the figure) and mouse antibody 911 Fab on<br><br>

Mouse anti-NGF antagonist antibody 911 was also tested, and similar results were<br>
observed. Specifically, Figure 16 is a graph showing comparison of the effect of various<br>
concentrations (200 nM or 80 nM) of full antibody E3 (termed "3E in the figure"), Fab E3,<br>

of Fab E3 (termed "3E in the figure"), or Fab 911 on the survival of E17 nodose neurons in<br>

[0390]	Transient cell expression was perfomed as follows: CHO and HEK293T<br>
cells in 150 mm dishes were transiently co-transfected with 25 ug of each plasmid (i.e., one<br>
plasmid containing the heavy chain and one plasmid containing the light chain). DNA was<br>
mixed with 100 ul lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. The DNA-lipid complexes were allowed to contact the cells in DMEM/F12<br>
medium without serum or antibiotics for 5 hours. Following this incubation, the media was<br>
changed for expression to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) without any additives for two days. Cell<br>
supernatants containing antibody were harvested sequentially up to four times with<br>
subsequent media replacement. Supernatants were purified by affinity chromatography<br>
using MapSelect Protein A resin (Amersham biosciences 17-5199-02). Antibody was<br>
bound to the protein A resin in 0.3M glycine, 0.6M NaCl buffer at pH 8, then eluted with<br>
0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 3. Fractions containing antibody were immediately neutralized<br>
with 1M Tris byffer at pH 8.0, An ibody fractions were then dialyzed and concentrated in<br>
PBS.<br>
Example 6: Anti-NGF ant body E3 is effective in treating post-surgical pain<br>
[0391]	We used a pain model that mimics post surgical pain to assess the efficacy<br>
of treatment with antibody E3. Antibody E3 comprised the human heavy chain IgG2a<br>
constant region containing the following mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid<br>
numbering with reference to the wildtype IgG2a sequence; see Eur. J. Immunol. (1999)<br>
29:2613-2624); the human light chain kappa constant region; and the heavy and light chain<br>
variable regions shown in Tables 1A and 1B.<br>
[0392]	Animals. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighting between 220-240 grams<br>
were purchased from Harlan (Wisconsin) and acclimated to the animal facility for one<br>
week prior to surgery.<br>
[0393]	Surgery. The surgery was based on the procedure described by Brennan, et<br>
al. Pain 64:493-501 (1996). Animals were anesthetized with a 2% isoflurane in air mixture<br>
that was maintained during surgery via amose cone. The plantar surface of the right hind<br>
paw was prepared with a povidone-iodine pad, and a 1-cm central longitudinal incision was<br>
made through skin and fascia, starting 0.5 cm from the edge of the heel and extending<br>
toward the toes. Measurements were made with a ruler with the foot held in a flexed<br>
position. The plantaris muscle was elevated using curved forceps and incised<br><br>
longitudinally. The muscle was incised through its full depth, between the origin and<br>
insertion. Bleeding was controlled throughout surgery by pressure applied through a gauze<br>
pad. The wound was closed with two mattress sutures (5-0 ethilon black monofilament).<br>
These sutures were knotted 5-6 tin tes, with the first knot loosely tied. The wound site was<br>
swabbed with bacitracin solution. Animals were allowed to recover and rest in clean cages<br>
for two hours or more before behavioral testing began.<br>
[0394]	Evaluating resting pain. A cumulative pain score was used to assess pain<br>
related to weight bearing. Animal s were placed on a plastic mesh (grid: 8mm ) in clear<br>
plastic cages that were elevated on a platform (h: 18") allowing inspection of the underside<br>
of their paws. After a 20 minute acclimation period, weight bearing was assessed on a<br>
scale of 0 to 2. A score of 0 was given if the; paw was blanched or pressed against the<br>
mesh, indicating full weight bearing. A score of 1 was given if the paw was favored with<br>
the skin just touching the mesh, with no blanching or indentation of the skin. A score of 2<br>
was given if the paw was held completely off the mesh. Flinching the paw was considered<br>
a 2 if the rat was still at rest. Each animal was observed for 1 minute every 5 minutes for<br>
30 minutes. The sum of 6 scores (0-12) obtained during 1/2-hour was used to assess pain<br>
in the incised foot. Frequency of scores of 2 was also calculated and used to assess the<br>
incidence of severe pain or total guarding of the paw by the animal. Each animal was<br>
tested 24 hours before surgery (baseline), and 2h, 24h, 48h, and 72h postoperatively. The<br>
results of this experiment are shown in Figure 1, which depicts the cumulative resting pain<br>
score observed in animals treated with 35 mg/kg of anti-NGF mouse antibody 911. These<br>
results demonstrated that treatment with anti-NGF antibody significantly reduced post-<br>
surgical resting pain. Weight bearing was a good correlate of how willing the animal was<br>
to use the limb, and therefore was an effective measure of pain relief.<br>
[0395]	The E3 antibody was injected intra peritoneal (i.p.) at various concentrations<br>
of the antibody (0.004, 0.01, 0.02 0.1, 0.6, and 1 mg per kilogram of animal weight) at 15<br>
hours pre-incision. The negative control group received no antibody but was injected i.p.<br>
with a saline solution. Fentanyl a: 0.01 mg/kg was injected i.p. as a positive control 30<br>
minutes before testing at 24 hours post-surgery. Each experiment involved 8 animals (n=8<br>
per group) for each condition, anc the control group had 56 animals. Surgery was<br>
performed and a cumulative pain score was measured as described above. Resting pain<br>
was evaluated twenty-four hours after the surgery.<br><br>

reduced resting pain (p

[0397]	In another experiment, the efficacy of the E3 antibody in reducing post-<br>
surgical pain when administered post-surgically was tested. Antibody E3 (0.5 mg/kg) were<br>
injected intravenously (i.v.) two hours after surgery. The control group received no<br>
antibody but was injected i.v. with a saline solution. Surgery was performed and resting<br>
pain expressed as a cumulative pain score was assessed 24 hours after surgery. As shown<br>
in Figure 8, treatment with anti-NGF antibody significantly (p

arthritis in rats were investigated using the vocalization test, in comparison with<br>
indomethacine used as reference substance.<br>
[0399]	Fifty (50) male Lewis rats (LEWIS LEW / Crl Ico) (Charles River Belgium)<br>
weighing 150 g to 220 g at the beginning of the experimental phase were included in this<br>
study. All animals were kept for at least 5 days before the experiment, and were housed in<br>
a temperature (19.5-24.5 °C), relative humidity (45-65 %) and 12-h light/dark cycle-<br>
controlled room with ad libitum access to filtered tap-water and standard pelleted<br>
laboratory chow (U.A.R., France) throughout the study. Animals were individually<br>
identified on the tail.<br>
[0400]	On day 0 (DO),arthritis was induced in rats by intradermal injection into the<br>
tail of 0.05 ml of a Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco, USA) suspension in mineral oil (10<br>
mg/ml). On day 14 (D14), arthritic rats were included in the study according to their ability<br><br>
to vocalize upon gentle flexion of the hindpaw and by their arthritis index, evaluated using<br>
an inflammation score for each hind and forepaw (see Kuzuna et al., Chem. Pharm.<br>
Bull.(Tokyo) 23:1184-1191 (1975); Pearson et al., Arthritis Rheum. 2:440-459 (1959)).<br>
Animals were scored based on the following criteria: Score 0: normal aspect; Score 1:<br>
erythema; Score 2: erythema with slight edema; Score 3: strong inflammation without<br>
ankylosis; Score 4: ankylosis. Only animals able to vocalize upon gentle flexion and<br>
presenting a score of 2 or 3 were included in. the study.<br>
[0401]	Four groups of 10: yats each were included in the study. For group 1<br>
(vehicle), on day 14 (D14), after selection, rats were intravenously administered by vehicle<br>
(saline). On day 18 (D18), the not iceptive intensity was evaluated by gentle flexion of the<br>
hindpaw and the intensity of the level of vocalization was recorded for each animal. For<br>
group 2 (4 days), on D14, after selection, rats were intravenously administered 911 (10<br>
mg/kg). On day 18 (D18), the nociceptive intensity was evaluated by gentle flexion of the<br>
hindpaw and the intensity of the 1 level of vocalization was recorded for each animal. For<br>
group 3 (24 hours), on day 17 after injection of CFA, rats were intravenously administered<br>
911 (10 mg/kg). The nociceptive intensity Avas evaluated by gentle flexion of the hindpaw<br>
24 hours later, and the intensity of the level of vocalization was recorded for each animal.<br>
For group 4 (indomethacin), on day 18 (D18), the nociceptive intensity was evaluated by<br>
gentle flexion of the hindpaw one hour after oral administration of indomethacin (10<br>
mg/kg). The intensity of the level of vocalization was also recorded for each animal. The<br>
test substances were administerec in a blind and random manner by intravenous route<br>
under a volume of 5 ml/kg, whereas indomethacin was administered by oral route under a<br>
volume of 10 ml/kg.<br>

an internal positive control substance. Analgesic effects of E3 and 911 were evaluated by<br>
the measurement of nociceptive response. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by<br>
paw volume, arthritis index (inflanimation score), body and hindpaws weight. Paw<br>
cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-lβ, TUF-α and TGF-βl), circulating TGF-βl in serum, E3 and<br>

Experimental protocol<br>
1. Study design<br><br>
[04051	80 male Lewis rats (LEWIS Lew / Ico) (Charles River Laboratories-<br>
Belgium) 5-weeks old were included in this study. They were housed in a temperature<br>
(19.5-24.5°C) and relative humidity (45-65%) controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle,<br>
with ad libitum access to filtered tap-water and standard pelleted laboratory chow (SAFE,<br>
France) throughout the study. Upon receipt at animal facilities, they were housed 5 per<br>
cage and a 10-day acclimatization period were observed before any testing. Animals were<br>
individually identified on the tail.<br>
[0406]	Five groups of 10 animals (5-weeks old male Lewis rats -LEWIS Lew/Ico,<br>
from Charles River Laboratories. Belgium) each were included in this study: Group 1:<br>
non arthritic rats / saline (vehicle), i.v. bolus,n=10; Group 2: arthritic rats / saline (vehicle),<br>
i.v. bolus, n=10; Group 3: arthritic rats / Indomethacin 3 mg/kg, p.o daily over 10 days,<br>
n=10; Group 4 : arthritic rats / E3,1 mg/kg , i.v. bolus, n=10; Group 5 :<br>
arthritic rats / 911,10 mg/kg, i.v. bolus, n=10. The doses were expressed in terms of free<br>
active substance (mg/kg). E3 ant, 911 were extemporaneously prepared in saline from the<br>
stock solution to the desired concentration. E3 1 mg/kg: 3.41 mL of the stock solution<br>
(0.88 mg/ml) q.s.p. 15 mL of saline. 911 10 mg/kg: 12 mL of the stock solution (2.5<br>
mg/ml) q.s.p. 15 mL of saline. All diluted solutions (before i.v. injection) were sterilized<br>
using a sterile filter unit of 0.20 (µm. pH and osmolarity values of diluted solutions were<br>
measured before each i.v. injection. Before the first i.v., osmolarity (mosm/L) for saline,<br>
E3, and 911 were 278,269, and 308 respectively; pH for saline, E3, and 911 were 5.93,<br>
6.76, 6.71 respectively. Before the second i.v., osmolarity (mosm/L) for saline, E3, and<br>
911 were 280,270, and 309 respectively; pH for saline, E3, and 911 were 5.86, 6.72, and<br>
6.59 respectively.<br>
[0407]	E3 or 911 or saline were administered by i.v. bolus injection on Day 14 and<br>
Day 19 after arthritis induction in a coded end random order with a volume of 5 mL/kg.<br>
The non arthritic group was given by i.v. bolus injection of saline on Day 14 and Day 19<br>
with a volume of 5 mL/kg. Indomethacin was extemporaneously prepared in 1%<br>
methylcellulose. Indomethacin was administered by oral route (p.o.) once daily over 10<br>
days from Day 14 to Day 23 after arthritis induction in a coded and random order with a<br>
volume of 10 mL/kg.<br>
2. Induction of arthritis<br><br>
[0408]	On Day 0 (D 0), arthritis was induced in 70 rats by intradermal injection into<br>
the tail of 0.05 ml of a Mycobacterium butyricum suspension. A group of 10 rats did not<br>
receive any intradermal injection (non arthritic rats). On Day 14 (D 14), the arthritic rats<br>
were included in the study using the following criteria: all included rats displayed an<br>
increase of mean paw volume (mean of the left and right paw volume) of at least 0.30 ml<br>
compared to the mean paw volume (mean of the left and right paw volume) in the non<br>
arthritic group (paw volume measurement as described below); all included rats displayed a<br>
vocalization upon gentle flexion (ncciceptive response measurement as described below);<br>
and all included rats displayed a score of arthritis index of 2-3 on each hindpaw (arthritis<br>
index measurement as described be(ow) (the (animals with a score of 0,1 or 4 were<br>
discarded).<br>
3. Body weight<br>
[0409]	The animals were weighed once daily from Day 0 to Day 24 (except during<br>
the week-end days before the treatment: D 1, D 2, D 8, D 9, D10). All measurements were<br>
performed between 9:00 and 12:00 am except at D 14 (7:30 - 9:00 am) and D 24 (7:30 -<br>
8:00 am).<br>
3.	Paw volume measurement<br>
[0410]	The right and left hindpaw volume of each rat (arthritic and non arthritic<br>
rats) was measured using a plethysmometer. The measurements were performed at the<br>
following times (after induction of arthritis): Day 14 (before i.v. bolus or p.o.<br>
administration); and Day 24 (5 days after the last i.v. bolus injection or 24 h after the last<br>
p.o. administration). All measurements were performed between 9:00 and 12:00 am. All<br>
the data were collected and stored by the WinDas software.<br>
4.	Arthritis index<br>
[0411]	Arthritis index was evaluated using an inflammation score for each hind and<br>
forepaw (arthritic rats): Score 0 normal aspect; Score 1: erythema; Score 2: erythema with<br>
slight edema; Score 3: strong inflammation without ankylosis; Score 4: ankylosis. This<br>
evaluation was performed at the following times (after induction of arthritis): Day 14<br>
(before i.v. bolus or p.o. admin stration); and Day 24 (5 days after the last i.v. bolus<br>
injection or 24 h after the last p .o. administration). All measurements were performed<br>
between 2:00 and 3:00 pm (D 4), 8:00 and 9:00 am (D 24). All the data were collected<br>
and stored by the WinDas software.<br><br>
5. Measurement of nociceptive response (Vocalization test)<br>
[0412]	The nociceptive response was evaluated by gentle flexion of the right and<br>
left hindpaw repeatedly 2 times an intervals of 4 to 5 sec with a finger of the operator<br>
(arthritic rats). The intensity of the level of vocalization was recorded for each animal for<br>
each hindpaw (2 times: on right hindpaw: s1 and s3; 2 times: on left hindpaw: s2 and s4).<br>
This evaluation was performed at the following times (after induction of arthritis): Day 14<br>
(before i.v. bolus or p.o. administration); Day 18 (before the second i.v. bolus injection or 1<br>
hr after p.o. administration); and Day 24 (5 days after the last i.v. bolus injection or 24 h<br>
after the last p.o. administration). All measurements were performed between 9:00 and<br>
12:00 am except at D 14 (7:30 - S :()0 am) and D 24 (7:30 - 9: 00 am).<br>
6. Blood collection for measurement of E3 or 911 concentration and circulating TGF-βl<br>
and hematological parameters<br>
[0413]	On Day 24 (after paw volume and arthritis index measurements and test<br>
vocalization), under general anaesthesia using isoflurane (in a mixture of oxygen and<br>
nitrous oxide), the blood samples (about 800-1000 µl) was collected by capillary action<br>
with a micropipette from retroorbilal sinus.<br>
[0414]	Measurement of E 3 or 911 concentration (groups 2,4 and 5): A part of<br>
blood sample was collected in tubes containing Li-Heparin (maintained on ice) and<br>
centrifuged at 2500-3000 g for 10 min. Plasma samples (at least 100 µL) were obtained,<br>
frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80°C. One sample was slightly hemolyzed (vehicle-<br>
treated arthritic rat # 36).<br>
[0415]	Measurement ofc rculating TGF-βI (groups 1-2-3-4-5): A part of blood<br>
sample was collected in micro tubes for serum preparation at ambient temperature.<br>
Following sample collection, blood was mixed and allowed to clot for 30 minutes prior to<br>
the centrifugation. The tubes were centrifuged at about 6000 g for 3 minutes. Each serum<br>
sample (at least 100 µL, except for rat # 52 and #53) was aliquoted and stored at -20°C<br>
until sample activation for TGF-β1analysis;. These aliquots (50 vials) were kept for a<br>
period of 6 months starting from the end of the study. Some samples were slightly<br>
hemolyzed (vehicle-treated non arthritic rat: # 2, # 5, # 9, # 10; vehicle treated arthritic rat:<br>
# 53, # 63; E3-treated arthritic rai #31, #51; 911 -treated arthritic rat: # 52, 62, #64). TGF-<br>
pl levels were measured using human TGF-βl ELISA kit (ref. DB100, Batch 212258 and<br>
213610, R&amp;D Systems - France).<br><br>
[0416]	Blood collection for hematological parameters (groups 1-2-3-4-5: 50 vials):<br>
A part of blood sample was collected in tubes containing K3 - EDTA (at least 100 µL). The<br>
determination of parameters were parformed on the day of the collection and the samples<br>
were not stored. The hematological parametersi including red blood cells, white blood cells,<br>
platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit were measured with a hematology cell counter (D 24).<br>
Some hematological parameters were not measured due to the clotted samples (vehicle-<br>
treated non arthritic rat: # 10; E3-treated arthritic rats: # 59, # 67; 911-treated arthritic rats:<br>
#16).<br>
7. Paw cytokines levels<br>
[0417]	On Day 24 (5 days after the last i.v. bolus injection or 24 hours after the last<br>
p.o. administration) (after X-rays radiographies), each animal hindpaw (arthritic and non<br>
arthritic rats) was weighed and was collected in a labelled polyethylene vial. Tissue<br>
samples were frozen in liquid nitregen and stored at -80°C.<br>
[0418]	Preparation of join t homogenates: Frozen hind paws were pulverized using .<br>
a Bio-Pulverizer. The powdered hind paws were then placed into a 50 ml conical centrifuge<br>
tube containing 3 ml PBS supplernented with 50 µl of anti-protease cocktail and<br>
homogenized on ice using Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (50% of the maximal speed).<br>
Homogenates were then centringed at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C and supernatants<br>
were filtered through 0.2 µm Sar onus filters, aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use.<br>

duplicate, according to the manufacturer's procedure. Aliquots of hind paw homogenates<br>
were stored at -80°C<br>
8. X-ray analysis<br>
[0420]	On Day 24, afte r blood collecting the animals were sacrificed and X-ray<br>
radiographies (hindpaws) were obtained for assessment of joint lesions. X-ray analysis was<br>
focused on articular erosions, articular space, periosteum abnormalities on both hindpaws.<br><br>
All the radiographics were analyzed by looking at seven different items: the soft tissue<br>
damage, deformity, demineralization, joint space, erosions, osteogenesis and periostal<br>
reaction. For each animal, the first six items were analyzed independently by looking at the<br>
worse hind foot. The periostal reaction was analyzed by looking at the tail. For each item,<br>
the score goes from 0 (normal) to 4 (maximal damage). Therefore the total score goes from<br>
0 to 28. The radiographic interpretation was done by the same reader without knowing<br>
anything about the animals (treated or not treated).<br>
9.	Observations<br>
[0421]	One animal (# 65) died at D 23 after indomethacin administration (before<br>
the administration at D 23) due to an unknown cause.<br>
10.	Analysis and expression of results<br>
[0422]	All results were re ported as Mean ± S.E.M. of 10 rats in each group at each<br>
time point. Paw volume was expressed in ml calculated from the mean value of the right<br>
and left paw volume. Arthritis ir dex was calculated from the sum of the score obtained for<br>
each of the 4 paws. The nocicepive response was evaluated by the intensity of the level of<br>
vocalization recorded for each arimal (mean of 4 values: 2 times/paw) in mV. The<br>
percentage inhibition of the nociceptive response was calculated from the mean value of<br>
the vehicle-treated arthritic group&gt; [(mean value of vehicle-treated arthritic group- mean<br>
value of treated arthritic group/ mean value of vehicle-treated arthritic group)* 100]. Body<br>
weight was expressed in grams. Hindpaws (left and right) weight was expressed in grams.<br>
Cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-lβ, TKF-a and TGF-βl) of each hind paw was expressed in<br>
pg/ml. Circulating levels of TGIF-β1 was expressed in pg/ml. Radiological index for each<br>
parameter (demineralization, erosions, periostal reaction, soft tissue damage, space joint,<br>
osteogenesis deformity) and tota radiological index (total score) were calculated from the<br>
sum of the scores obtained for each parameter. The inter-group significances of the<br>
deviations between the values of vehicle-treated group (arthritic rats) and vehicle-treated<br>
group (non arthritic rats) were as jessed by the Student / test or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum<br>
Test when equal variance or nonrrnality test failed. The inter-group significances of the<br>
deviations between the values of vehicle-treated group (arthritic rats) and E3- and 911- and<br>
Indomethacin-treated groups were assessed by the 1-way analysis of variance ANOVA<br>
followed by the non-paired Dunr ett / test. A probability of P≥0.05 was considered as<br>
significant. All statistical analys s was performed by the Sigmastat™ software.<br><br>
Results<br>
1. Nociceptive response (vocalization test)<br>
[0423]	As shown in Table 11 and Figure 18, on D 14, the nociceptive response was<br>
4147 ±331,4386 ± 235,4644 ± 367 and 4468 ± 143 in vehicle-, indomethacin-, E3-, and<br>
911-treated arthritic groups, respectively. Indomethacin strongly and significantly<br>
decreased the nociceptive response after 3 mgfcg/day p.o. (for 10 days) by about -3768 mV<br>
(% inhibition: 71 %) and -4353 mV (% inhibition: 74 %) at D 18 and D 24, respectively<br>
compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group (D 18: 1511 ± 398 vs 5279 ± 326 mV; D 24:<br>
1552 ± 508 vs 5905 ± 345 mV). E J (1 mg/kg i.v. at D 14 and D 19) strongly and<br>
significantly decreased the nociceptive response by about -4167 mV (% inhibition : 79 %)<br>
and -5905 mV (% inhibition: 100 %) at D 18 and D 24, respectively compared to the<br>
vehicle-treated arthritic group (D : 8:1112 ± 401 vs 5279 ± 326 mV; D 24: 0 ± 0 vs 5905 ±<br>
345 mV). 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. 2 days at D 14 and D 19) strongly and significantly decreased<br>
the nociceptive response by about -3932 (% inhibition: 74 %) and -5358 mV (% inhibition:<br>

2. Body weight<br>
[0424]	As shown in Table 12 and Figure 19, a marked decrease in the body weight<br>
gain was observed in arthritic rats in comparison to non arthritic rats from D 0 to D 14 due<br>
to arthritis establishment. At D 14 (selection day) the arthritic rats displayed a significant<br>
decrease in weight compared to the non arthritic rats (289 ±2vs217±4g) (Student / test<br>
P
groups (Dunnett / test P&gt; 0.05). The body weight moderately and significantly increased in<br>
Indomethacin-treated group (3 mg/kg/day for 10 days) from D 17 to D 24 with a maximum<br>
of about 43 g at D 24 compared tc the vehicle-treated arthritic group (261 ± 5 vs 218 ± 3 g).<br>
After E3 treatment (1 mg/kg i.v. at D 14 and D 19), the body weight moderately and<br>
significantly increased from D 17 to D 24 with a maximum of about 46 g at D 24 compared<br>
to the vehicle-treated arthritic group (264 ± 5 g vs 218 ± 3 g). After 911 treatment (10<br>
mg/kg i.v. at D 14 and D 19), the body weight moderately and significantly increased from<br>
D 18 to D 24 with a maximum of about 47g; at D 24 compared to the vehicle-treated<br>
arthritic (265 ± 7 vs 218 ± 3 g).<br><br><br><br>
[0425]	On D 14, a randomi zation was performed in order to obtain homogenous<br>
groups in terms of paw volume. As shown in Table 13, on D 14, the hindpaw volume<br>
(mean of the right and left paw volume) was significantly greater in arthritic group than<br>
that in non arthritic group (2.10 ± 0.05 vs 1.44 ± 0.02 mL (Student / test P
Indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day p.o. for 10 days) significantly decreased the paw volume by<br>
about -0.75 mL (D 24) compared 10 the vehicle-treated arthritic group (1.59 ± 0.03 mL vs<br>
2.34 ± 0.08 mL). E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) slightly and significantly increased<br>
the paw volume by about 0.37 mI compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group (2.71 ±<br>
0.09 mL vs 2.34 ± 0.08 mL). 911(10 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) slightly and<br>
significantly increased the paw volume by about 0.36 mL compared to the vehicle-treated<br>
arthritic group (2.70 ± 0.11 mL vs 2.34 ± 0.08 mL).<br><br><br>

4. Arthritis index<br>
[0426]	As shown in Table 14, on D 14, the arthritis index was 10.1 ± 0.8, 8.7 ± 0.6,<br>
10.2 ± 0.4 and 9.4 ± 0.7 and in vehicle- indomethacin-, E3-, and 911- treated arthritic<br>
groups, respectively. Indomethacin strongly and significantly decreased the arthritis index<br>
after 3 mg/kg/day p.o. (for 10 days) by a maximum of about -8.0 compared to the vehicle-<br>
treated arthritic group (2.7 ± 0.7 vs 10.7 ± 0.6). E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) did not<br>
affect the arthritis index compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group (11.4 ± 0.4 vs 10.7<br>
± 0.6). 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. on 1) 14 and D 19) did not affect the arthritis index compared to<br>

5. Paw cytokines levels<br>
[0427]	As shown in Table 15, on D 24, the left and right paws cytokine levels were<br>
increased in arthritic vehicle-treaed group by a maximum of about 3.5 (IL-lβ), 4 (TNF-α)<br>
and 1.8 (TGF-βi) fold compared to the non-arthritic vehicle-treated group. No significant<br>
difference was observed for IL-6 levels, in right and left paw, between the two groups.<br>
The cytokines levels of arthritic group were similar in left and right paw: 259.7 ± 38.5 vs<br>
219.2 ± 32.4, 4802.8 ± 365.5 vs 
1219.8 vs 9161.4 ± 846.1 pg/ml lor IL-6, IL-ip, TNF-α and TGF-β1 respectively.<br>
Indomethacin slightly, but significantly, decreased the TGF-β1 level in right paw after 3<br>
mg/kg/day p.o. (for 10 days) by about 1.3 times, compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic<br>
group (7057.4 ± 335.6 vs 9161.4 ± 846.1), whereas it did not modify IL-6, TNF-a or 1L-1 β<br>
levels. A similar but not signific mt effect was observed in the left paw. E3 (1 mg/kg i.v.<br><br>
on D 14 and D 19) did not affect the IL-6, IL-lβ, TNF-a or TGF-βl levels, in both paws,<br>
compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group. 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19)<br>
increased the IL-1β level in right paw compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group<br>
(6215.3 ± 666.7 vs 4007.1 ± 380.4) It had no effect on others cytokine levels in both<br>
paws.<br><br><br><br>

6. Measurement of circulating TGF-β1<br>
[0428]	As shown in Table 16, on D 24, the serum TGF-β1 level was increased in<br>
arthritic vehicle-treated group compared to the non arthritic vehicle-treated group (81715.7<br>
± 1984.1 vs 60269.9 ± 2142.8). [ndomethacin significantly decreased the serum TGF-β1<br>
level after 3 mg/kg/day p.o. (for 10 days) by about 1.5 times, compared to the vehicle-<br>
treated arthritic group (57222.2:: 3194.1 vs 81715.7 ± 1984.1). E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. on D 14<br>
and D 19) and 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) significantly decreased the serum<br>
TGF-βl level so that the cytokir e level in E3- and 911-treated groups were comparable<br>
with those observed in vehicle-treated non arthritic group (69408.8 ± 3926.7 and 67214.5 ±<br>
3649.4 respectively, vs 60269.9 ± 2142.8).<br>

treated non arthritic rats (Student t test P
and hematocrit (Student t test P&gt; 0.05) were unchanged. Indomethacin did not affect the<br>
blood parameters after 3 mg/kg/day p.o. (for 10 days) compared to the vehicle-treated<br>
arthritic group. E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) did not affect the blood parameters<br>
compared to the vehicle-treated arthritic group. 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19) did<br>

[0430]	As shown in Table 18, the left and right hindpaw weight was greater in<br>
vehicle-treated arthritic rats than in vehicle-treated non arthritic rats (3.43 ± 0.11 vs 1.98 ±<br>

8. X-ray analysis<br>
[0431]	As shown in Table 19, a total score of 0.0 ± 0.0 was observed in the vehicle-<br>
treated non arthritic rats. The vehic le-treated arthritic rats have a total score of 15.1 ±1.3<br>
with high scores for demineralization (2.4 ± 0.3), erosions (2.7 ± 0.3), soft tissue damage<br>
(3.1 ± 0.2) and space joint (3.3 ± 0 2), a moderate score for periostal reaction (1.0 ± 0.3),<br>
osteogenesis (0.8 ± 0.2) and defomity (1.8 ± 0.2). Indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day p.o. for 10<br>
days) strongly and significantly de ;i eased the total score by about 10.7 in comparison to<br>
vehicle-treated arthritic rats (4.4 ± 0 9 vs 15.1 ± 1.3). E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. on D 14 and D 19)<br>
did not affect the total score comp* red to the vehicle-treated arthritic group (14.2 ± 1.3 vs<br>

Conclusion<br>
[0432]	Under experimental conditions described above, E3 (1 mg/kg i.v. 2 days: D<br>
14 - D 19) and 911 (10 mg/kg i.v. 2 days: D 14 - D 19) showed strong analgesic effects, but<br>
did not show significant anti-inflammatory effects in this arthritis model.<br>
Example 9 Effects of different doses of anti-NGF antibody E3 in a rat model of rheumatoid<br>
arthritis<br>
[0433]	The ability of E3 to produce reduction in pain in arthritic rats was further<br>
investigated by examining the dose response relationship between E3 administration and<br>
pain reduction. Rats were treated with adjuvant to induce arthritis as described above. Ten<br>
rats not injected with adjuvant were used as non-arthritic controls. Fourteen days after<br>
adjuvant injection, animals were qualif ed into the study based on the criteria stated above,<br><br>
randomized into eight groups of ten rats and tested for the intensity of their vocalization<br>
response. They were then dosed on day 14 with saline, or 0.003 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg, 0.03<br>
mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of E3 antibody as described above.<br>
Animals were tested for their vocalization response on days 16,18,20, and 24. Animals<br>
were redosed with saline or the same dose of E3 on day 18 after the vocalization testing.<br>
Animals were also weighed each day, starting at day 14. Thus, animals were dosed twice<br>
with a given dose of antibody or saline on days 14 and 18, and assessed for pain five times,<br>
on days 14,16,18,20 and 24. Data are shown in Tables 20-22 and in Figures 20-22.<br><br><br>
[0434]	The effect of treating animals with various doses of anti-NGF antibody E3<br>
on pain induced vocalization (data shown in Table 20) was statistically analyzed by using<br>
two-way AN OVA to compare the results obtained pairwise between arthritic animals<br>
treated with vehicle with those treated with a given dose of antibody E3. There was a<br>
highly significant effect at all levels of E3 tested (p
tested (0.003 mg/kg of E3), the difference in vocalization was significant (p
[0435]	As shown in Table 20 and Figure 20, in agreement with the above<br>
experiments, treatment with antibody E3 at 1 mg/kg showed a rapid and robust relief of<br>
pain. Within two days (the earliest time point tested) the vocalization intensity fell by 90%.<br>
Treatment with lower concentrations c f E3 also provided robust pain relief, although at<br>
lower doses the pain relief took somewhat longer to manifest. It is likely that the apparent<br>
decrease in efficacy on day 24 of all but the highest doses tested is due to a decrease in the<br>
actual level of plasma E3 level secondary to an immune response by the subject rats. It is<br>
apparent that doses as low as 0.003 mg/kg provide at least partial pain relief in this model.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0436]	The effect of treating animals with various doses of anti-NGF antibody E3<br>
on body weight was statistically analyzed by using two-way ANOVA to compare the<br>
results obtained pairwise between arthr tic animals treated with vehicle with those treated<br><br>
with a given dose of antibody E3. Using data normalized to weight on day 14 (Table 21),<br>
doses of 0.03 mg/kg of E3 resulted in a significant change in body weight (p
higher dose of E3, the difference between treated and untreated arthritic animals was<br>
significant (p=or 
0.03 mg/kg of E3 resulted in a signi Scant change in body weight (p
dose of E3, the difference between treated and untreated arthritic animals was significant<br>
(p
[0437]	Again in agreement with earlier studies, rats treated with E3 showed less<br>
apparent weight loss than saline treared arthritic rats (Table 22 and Figure 22). In fact, rats<br>
treated with high doses of antibody E3 were recovering the earlier weight loss, and actually<br>
gaining weight faster than their non- arthritic cohorts (Table 21 and Figure 21).<br>
