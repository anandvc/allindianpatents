Protective element for a measuring probe and<br>
corresponding measuring probe and honeycomb element<br>
The subject matter of the invention is a protective<br>
element, in particular for use in the exhaust system of<br>
an internal combustion engine for preventing water<br>
shock on measuring probes, and a measuring probe having<br>
such a protective element and a honeycomb element, in<br>
particular a catalytic converter carrier element and/or<br>
filter element with such a measuring probe and a<br>
corresponding motor vehicle. The preferred field of<br>
application is in the exhaust system of a motor<br>
vehicle, for example of an automobile or of a motor-<br>
operated two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
Measuring probes, in particular lambda probes, which<br>
are used in the exhaust systems of internal combustion<br>
engines, for example in honeycomb elements, are often<br>
made inoperative by water shock. Water shock is<br>
understood to be the process of wetting of the surface<br>
of the measuring probe with fluid water or else the<br>
condensing out of water vapor on the surface of the<br>
measuring probe.<br>
Since a water shock generally leads to irreparable<br>
damage or at least to a malfunction of the measuring<br>
probe, the present invention is based on the object of<br>
specifying measures which reliably prevent the water<br>
shock on a measuring probe, and to specify a<br>
corresponding measuring probe and honeycomb element as<br>
well as a corresponding motor vehicle.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a protective<br>
element having the features of claim 1, a measuring<br>
probe having the features of claim 15, a honeycomb<br>
element having the features of claim 21 and a motor<br>
vehicle having the features of claim 23., Advantageous<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 2 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
developments are the subject matter of the respective<br>
dependent claims..<br>
In a protective element according to the invention for<br>
a measuring probe, the protective element comprises at<br>
least one temporarily water-binding layer which in a<br>
first operating state binds water chemically and/or<br>
physically and in a second operating state releases the<br>
bound water. The protective element according to the<br>
invention is suitable in particular for a measuring<br>
probe for use in the exhaust system of a motor vehicle.<br>
The protective element is preferably configured in such<br>
a way that an inner surface can be applied at least<br>
partially to an outer surface of the measuring probe.<br>
When a measuring probe is installed in a honeycomb<br>
element such as, for example, a catalytic converter<br>
carrier element and/or a filter element, a temperature<br>
minimum is also present at the base of the measuring<br>
probe particularly in a cold starting phase of an<br>
internal combustion engine owing to the exothermic<br>
catalytic reaction, said base lying on the outer<br>
surface of the honeycomb element, in particular on an<br>
outer casing pipe which is formed there. This is due to<br>
the maximum thermal capacity which is present there and<br>
which brings about relatively slow heating. If the<br>
catalytic reaction has then started in parts of the<br>
honeycomb element, it is possible for water vapor to<br>
form in the interior of the honeycomb element owing to<br>
the exothermic character of the reaction. If said water<br>
vapor then touches the measuring probe, in particular a<br>
lambda probe, water condenses out here, that is to say<br>
a water shock occurs, at the coldest point, in<br>
particular on the outer surface of the honeycomb<br>
element and/or the base of the measuring probe bearing<br>
against the outer casing pipe, which base heats up<br>
slowly as a result of the relatively high thermal<br>
capacity of the outer casing pipe at this point. If a<br><br>
WO 2006/048192	- 3 - 				PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
protective element according to the invention is then<br>
formed here, in particular as an additional component<br>
which simply fits snugly over the measuring probe or<br>
else is integrally formed onto it, the water-binding<br>
layer causes water to be bound temporarily on or in<br>
said layer chemically and/or physically by<br>
chemisorption or physisorption in the first operating<br>
state.. In particular in the case of heated lambda<br>
probes, the protective element can also be embodied in<br>
such a way that a gap is formed between an inner<br>
surface of the protective element and an outer surface<br>
of the measuring probe, at least in certain areas. If<br>
the measuring probe comprises a measuring sensor, which<br>
is for example a corresponding semiconductor component<br>
which is surrounded by a protective cap which provides<br>
in particular protection against mechanical and/or<br>
thermal influences on the measuring sensor, the<br>
protective element can also preferably be embodied in<br>
such a way that it is formed between the measuring<br>
sensor and protective cap.<br>
The present chemical and/or physical bonding is<br>
reversible by changing into the second operating state.<br>
The change into the second operating state can be<br>
carried out, for example, by increasing the temperature<br>
so that, for example, water adsorbs onto and/or into<br>
the water-binding layer at temperatures below a<br>
limiting temperature, and desorbs again after the<br>
limiting temperature has been exceeded., The protective<br>
element is preferably also formed in its entirety from<br>
a temporarily water-binding material so that the<br>
temporarily water-binding layer forms the entire<br>
protective element.<br>
The water-binding layer thus acts as a type of sponge<br>
in which the water which causes the water shock is at<br>
least partially temporarily bound. If a large number of<br>
cold starts are carried out one after the other without<br><br>
WO 2006/048192	- 4 - PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
the limiting temperature being exceeded, this would<br>
cause the water absorption capacity of the water-<br>
binding layer to be exhausted at a specific time. For<br>
this reason, an engine management system for the<br>
internal combustion engine is particularly<br>
advantageous, in particular within the scope of the<br>
engine control system of the internal combustion engine<br>
of an automobile in which the execution of a plurality<br>
of cold starts which do not bring about a change into<br>
the second operating state is detected and the<br>
composition and/or quantity of the fuel is changed in<br>
good time before the water absorption capacity of the<br>
water-binding layer is exhausted, with the result that,<br>
for example, unburnt hydrocarbons reach the honeycomb<br>
element and are burnt there so that the second<br>
operating state is reliably brought about.<br>
The suitability of the protective element for a<br>
measuring probe for use in the exhaust system of a<br>
motor vehicle has the result, in particular, that the<br>
protective element can withstand the conditions in the<br>
exhaust system, in particular the temperatures present<br>
there and the temperature transients and/or temperature<br>
gradients occurring there, the corresponding gas<br>
pressures and/or highly reactive substances as well as<br>
mechanical loading and vibrations or impacts. Depending<br>
on the design of the protective element it may be<br>
suitable for surrounding the measuring probe and/or the<br>
measuring sensor completely or else only around part of<br>
its circumference, in particular in certain areas. In<br>
the latter case, the protective element can be<br>
embodied, for example, as a circular ring segment. It<br>
is also possible, and in accordance with the invention,<br>
to form a plurality of corresponding protective<br>
elements which extend around part of the circumference<br>
and which together enclose the measuring probe around<br>
its entire circumference, in particular in an axial<br>
region.<br><br>
WO 2006/048192		- 5 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
According to one advantageous development of the<br>
invention, the protective element has an essentially<br>
closed shape with an inner surface and an outer<br>
surface, and in particular the protective element is in<br>
the form of a ring and/or circular ring.<br>
The protective element may be embodied in particular in<br>
an annular fashion as a protective ring. A ring<br>
designates in this context in particular a closed<br>
structure which matches and/or can be matched in its<br>
geometric shape to the geometric shape of a measuring<br>
probe, a protective cap and/or a measuring sensor. A<br>
ring can consequently not only have a circular ring-<br>
shaped geometry but rather, for example, also have the<br>
basic shape of a polygon, preferably of a hexagon or<br>
quadrilateral, in particular a square or a rectangular<br>
or else an ellipse. Any closed, annular structure which<br>
has an outer surface and an inner surface is to be<br>
considered a ring within the sense of the present<br>
invention.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the<br>
securing ring according to the invention the protective<br>
element is at least partially compressible or elastic.<br>
When the protective element is embodied as a component<br>
which is separate from the measuring probe, this<br>
advantageously facilitates the attachment of the<br>
protective element to the measuring probe, for example<br>
by making it simply fit snugly over the measuring<br>
probe.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
securing ring according to the invention, at least the<br>
temporarily water-binding layer is porous, and has in<br>
particular a porosity of at least 40%, preferably more<br>
than 70%.<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 6 - 		PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
The formation of at least the temporarily water-binding<br>
layer as a porous structure advantageously increases<br>
the surface which is available for chemical and/or<br>
physical binding of the water.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
latter, in particular the water-binding layer,<br>
comprises at least one of the following materials:<br>
a)	mica;<br>
b)	aluminum oxide, in particular □-aluminum oxide; or<br>
c)	zeolite, in particular zeolite A, X and/or Y<br>
and/or faujasite..<br>
Mica is understood in particular to be silicate<br>
materials which crystallize in a monoclinal fashion,<br>
for example muscovite, lepidolite, biotite or<br>
paragonite. In particular, mica is understood to be<br>
materials, which can be represented by means of the<br>
following formula:<br>
(K, Na, Ca) (Al, Mg, Fe, Li) 2_3 (OH) 2 (Si, A1)4-5O10<br>
where the atoms in brackets can be represented in any<br>
desired combination.. The term zeolite is understood to<br>
mean both naturally occurring and synthetically<br>
manufactured aluminosilicates, in particular also those<br>
which have been subjected to at least partial cationic<br>
exchange.. Basically however, it is also possible, and<br>
in accordance with the invention, to use other<br>
materials to construct the water-binding layer if, by<br>
means of these materials, water can be bound in a first<br>
operating state and released again in a second<br>
operating state., The formation of the water-binding<br>
layer from a plurality of materials or a plurality of<br>
water-binding layers is also possible and in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/048192		- 7 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, said<br>
protective element is temperature resistant at<br>
temperatures up to 500°C, preferably 750°C,<br>
particularly preferably 1000°C.<br>
Such temperature resistance advantageously permits use<br>
in the exhaust system of an automobile.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
first operating state and the second operating state<br>
differ in operating temperature.<br>
Accordingly, the change from one operating state to the<br>
other can be brought about by changing the operating<br>
temperature, that is to say the temperature which is<br>
present at the protective element.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
first operating state is present essentially at<br>
temperatures below a limiting temperature, in<br>
particular a desorption temperature, and the second<br>
operating state is present essentially at temperatures<br>
above the limiting temperature.<br>
This distinguishes in particular the temporary binding<br>
of the water by adsorption. Limiting temperature is to<br>
be understood here also as a limiting temperature range<br>
in which a change in the ratio of adsorption to<br>
desorption occurs at or in the water-binding layer.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
limiting temperature is higher than the boiling<br>
temperature of water.<br><br>
WO 2006/048192		- 8 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
This effectively prevents water from being released by<br>
the water-binding layer and condensing directly out<br>
again. In particular, the limiting temperature is<br>
higher than 100°C.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
water-binding layer is located at least partially on a<br>
surface of the protective element.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
water-binding layer is formed at least partially on a<br>
surface of the protective element which is at least<br>
partially on the outside in relation to the measuring<br>
probe and/or in relation to a measuring sensor.<br>
The water-binding layer is thus at least not<br>
exclusively formed on the inner surface of the<br>
protective element and also not exclusively formed on<br>
the outer surface of the protective element which in<br>
particular bears against the inner surface of the<br>
measuring probe wall when the measuring sensor is<br>
installed later. This means that the water-binding<br>
layer is preferably formed in areas at the surface of<br>
the protective element which are in contact with the<br>
exhaust gas when said protective element is used, for<br>
example, in the honeycomb element.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br>
protective element is suitable for essentially gas-<br>
tight abutment against the outer surface of the<br>
measuring probe and/or of the measuring sensor.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention, the<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 9 - 		PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
protective element is suitable for essentially gas-<br>
tight abutment against an inner surface of a measuring<br>
probe bore.<br>
By Virtue Of the suitability for essentially gas-tight<br>
abutment against the outer surface of the measuring<br>
probe and/or the inner surface of the measuring probe<br>
bore, the protective element can also carry out a<br>
sealing function, and can, for example, by embodied as<br>
a sealing ring.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
protective element according to the invention the<br>
protective element comprises heating means.<br>
The protective element can be heated by these heating<br>
means. Heating the protective element additionally<br>
effectively reduces the possibility of water shock. The<br>
heating means may, for example, comprise a simple<br>
heating wire which is formed in the interior of the<br>
protective element.<br>
According to a further aspect of the inventive idea, a<br>
measuring probe is proposed for use in the exhaust<br>
system of an internal combustion engine, in particular<br>
a lambda probe, a temperature sensor and/or gas<br>
concentration sensor which comprises at least one<br>
protective element according to the invention.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the<br>
measuring probe according to the invention, the<br>
measuring probe comprises a measuring sensor, wherein<br>
the protective element comprises at least an inner<br>
surface which abuts at least partially against an outer<br>
surface of the measuring probe and/or of the measuring<br>
sensor and/or is formed at least partially opposite an<br>
outer surface of the measuring probe and/or of the<br>
measuring sensor. It is particularly preferred here for<br><br>
WO 2006/048192		- 10 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
a gap to be formed between the outer surface of the<br>
measuring probe and/or of the measuring sensor and the<br>
inner surface of the protective element, at least in<br>
certain areas.<br>
The protective element can preferably be integrally<br>
formed on the measuring probe and/or the measuring<br>
sensor and/or be connected thereto in a materially<br>
joined fashion, in particular welded thereto. A<br>
positively locking and/or frictionally locking<br>
connection is also possible and in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
measuring probe according to the invention, said<br>
measuring probe comprises a protective cap, the<br>
protective element being formed between the protective<br>
cap and measuring sensor.<br>
A protective cap is generally formed in particular on<br>
lambda probes. In this case, the protective cap<br>
surrounds the measuring sensor, with suitable openings<br>
permitting the gas to be analyzed to pass to the<br>
measuring senor of the lambda probe which lies inside<br>
the protective cap. This protective cap serves<br>
primarily to avoid transportation damage and<br>
installation damage. Although such a protective cap is<br>
also intended to prevent water shock, that is to say<br>
for example a thermal shock to the generally heated<br>
measuring sensor through contact with water droplets,<br>
damage due to water shock occurs relatively often<br>
despite such protective caps, in particular if a motor<br>
vehicle is predominantly driven over short distances,<br>
that is to say generally in cold start phases. In such<br>
a case, the formation of the protective element<br>
according to the invention additionally between the<br>
protective cap and actual measuring sensor can further<br><br>
WO 2006/048192		- 11 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
significantly reduce the risk of water shock, in<br>
particular in the case of lambda probes.<br>
According to a further aspect of the inventive idea, a<br>
honeycomb element, in particular a catalytic converter<br>
carrier element and/or filter element, is proposed<br>
which has cavities through which a fluid can flow,<br>
comprising at least one protective element according to<br>
the invention and/or at least one measuring probe<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The honeycomb element according to the invention may be<br>
constructed from metallic and/or ceramic materials, and<br>
in particular can be wound or layered and twisted or<br>
else extruded from at least partially textured metallic<br>
and/or ceramic layers and, if appropriate essentially<br>
smooth metallic and/or ceramic layers.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
honeycomb element according to the invention, the<br>
water-binding layer comprises at least partially a<br>
surface of the protective element which can be placed<br>
in fluid mechanical contact with the cavities.<br>
In fluid mechanical contact means in this context in<br>
particular that when a fluid, in particular exhaust<br>
gas, flows through the honeycomb element it can come<br>
into contact with or flow around the measuring sensor<br>
and/or protective element. In this case, the protective<br>
element effectively prevents water shock, in particular<br>
if it is formed at the location on the measuring probe<br>
with the greatest thermal capacity such as, for<br>
example, at a base at the junction between the<br>
measuring probe and outer casing pipe of the honeycomb<br>
element.<br>
According to a further aspect of the inventive idea, a<br>
motor vehicle, in particular an automobile, a motorized<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 12 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
two-wheeled vehicle, an aircraft or a boat is proposed<br>
which comprises at least one honeycomb element<br>
according to the invention, one measuring probe<br>
according to the invention and/or one protective<br>
element according to the invention.<br>
The details and advantages which are disclosed for the<br>
protective element according to the invention can be<br>
transferred and applied in the same way to the<br>
measuring probe according to the invention, the<br>
honeycomb element according to the invention and/or the<br>
motor vehicle according to the invention. Further<br>
advantages and exemplary embodiments of the invention<br>
are explained with reference to the drawing without<br>
restricting the invention thereto. In said drawing:<br>

and<br>
figure 4 is a schematic view of a measuring probe<br>

Figure 1 shows a honeycomb element 1 comprising a<br>
honeycomb structure 2 and an outer casing pipe 3. The<br>
honeycomb structure 2 is constructed in the present<br>
example by stacking and twisting essentially smooth<br>
layers 4 and at least partially textured layers 5<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 13 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
which, for the sake of clarity, are only shown<br>
partially. The layers 4, 5 can be constructed from<br>
metallic and/or ceramic material, in particular also<br>
filter material. The layers 4, 5 form cavities 6<br>
through which a fluid can flow, in the present example<br>
ducts which extend from one end of the honeycomb<br>
elements 1 to the other.<br>
The outer casing pipe 3 comprises a measuring probe<br>
bore 7 in which a measuring probe 8 is placed. In order<br>
to secure the measuring probe 8 in the measuring probe<br>
bore 7, a connecting means 9, for example a thread, is<br>
formed which corresponds to matching connecting means<br>
(not shown) of the measuring probe 8.<br>
A protective element 10 is formed between the measuring<br>
probe bore 7 and the measuring probe 8. Said protective<br>
element 10 has a water-binding layer 11 which is formed<br>
on the surface of the protective element. 10 in such a<br>
way that when the exhaust gas flows through the<br>
honeycomb element 1 the protective element 10 comes<br>
into contact with the exhaust gas. In this context, the<br>
water-binding layer 11 is formed on the outside in<br>
relation to the measuring probe 8, i.e. in particular<br>
not on the inner surface 13 of the protective element<br>
10 which is in direct contact with the outer surface 14<br>
of the measuring probe 8. A carrier layer 12 is formed<br>
under the water-binding layer 11 and may be, for<br>
example, elastic or compressible. However, it is also<br>
possible and in accordance with the invention to form<br>
the entire protective element 10 as water-binding layer<br>
11. Forming the water-binding layer 11, which as stated<br>
above permits the temporary chemical and/or physical<br>
binding of water, can effectively prevent water shock<br>
owing to water from water vapor contained in the<br>
exhaust gas, in particular in the cold start phase of<br>
the engine, condensing out before the honeycomb element<br>
1 has therefore reached a temperature which is above<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 14 - 		PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
the boiling point of water. In this context, the water-<br>
binding layer 11 acts as a type of sponge which<br>
temporarily stores water and releases it again. In the<br>
case of a water-binding layer 11 which binds water<br>
through absorption, the water can be released through<br>
desorption after a desorption temperature has been<br>
exceeded if the honeycomb element 1, and thus also the<br>
protective element 10 and water-binding layer 11,<br>
become hotter due to the heating through exhaust gas<br>
and the exothermal reaction which occurs.<br>
Figure 2 shows a measuring probe 8 with a second<br>
exemplary embodiment of a protective element 10<br>
according to the invention in cross section. The<br>
protective element 10 is embodied here as a protective<br>
ring which completely surrounds the circumference of<br>
the measuring probe 8. An inner surface 13 of the<br>
protective element 10 abuts in an essentially gas-tight<br>
fashion against an outer surface 14 of the measuring<br>
probe 8. When there is essentially gas-tight abutment<br>
of the outer surface 15 of the protective element<br>
against an inner surface (not shown) of a measuring<br>
probe bore 7, the protective element 10 at the same<br>
time carries out a sealing function in order to<br>
effectively prevent exhaust gas emerging from the<br>
honeycomb element 1. Furthermore, heating means 16 are<br>
provided which in the present exemplary embodiment are<br>
composed of a heating coil. Other heating means 16 are<br>
possible and in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view of a measuring probe 8<br>
according to the invention which has a thread 17 which<br>
corresponds to a connecting means 9 of a measuring<br>
probe bore 8, The actual recording of measured values<br>
is carried out here by means of a measuring sensor 18<br>
which is embodied, for example, with rectangular-<br>
geometry as a semiconductor component. The measuring<br>
sensor 18 is surrounded by a protective cap 19 which<br><br>
WO 2006/048192			- 15 - 			PCT/EP2005/011561<br>
protects the measuring sensor 18 against mechanical<br>
effects, for example. A protective element 10 according<br>
to the invention is formed in the interior of the<br>
protective cap 19 so that a gap 20 is formed between an<br>
inner surface 13 of the protective element 10 and an<br>
outer surface of the measuring sensor 18. This is<br>
advantageous in particular if the measuring probe 8 is<br>
designed so as to be heated, in particular in the<br>
region of the measuring sensor 18. In such a measuring<br>
sensor 18, the protective element 10 serves as an<br>
additional protection against possible water shock.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic, cross-sectional view of a<br>
measuring probe 8 according to the invention,<br>
comprising a measuring sensor 18, a protective cap 19<br>
and a protective element 10 according to the invention.<br>
The protective element 10 is embodied in such a way<br>
that an inner surface 13 of the protective element 10<br>
is separated from an outer surface of a measuring<br>
sensor 18 by a gap 20, in which case the shape and size<br>
of the gap 20 can vary depending on the exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
The protective element 10 according to the invention<br>
effectively prevents water shock on the measuring probe<br>
8 due to the formation of the water-binding layer 11<br>
since water condensing out from water vapor in<br>
particular in the cold start phase at the point on the<br>
measuring probe 8 with the greatest thermal capacity is<br>
prevented.. The water-binding layer 11 temporarily binds<br>
the water in one operating state in order to release it<br>
again in another operating state.<br><br>
