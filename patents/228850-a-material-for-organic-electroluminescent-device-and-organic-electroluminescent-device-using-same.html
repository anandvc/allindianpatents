DESCRIPTION<br>
MATERIAL FOR ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE USING SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a material for an organic electroluminescent ("electroluminescent" will be referred to as "EL", hereinafter) device and an organic EL device using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a material for organic EL devices which exhibits a great efficiency of light emission, few defects of a pixel, and is superior in heat resistance. Further, the present invention relates to an organic EL device using the preceding material.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An organic electroluminescence ("electroluminescence" will be also occasionally referred to as "EL", hereinafter) device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since an organic EL device of the laminate type driven under a low electric voltage was reported by C. W. Tang of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Pages 913, 1987), many studies have been conducted on organic EL devices using organic materials as the constituting materials. Tang et al. used a laminate structure using tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum for the light<br><br>
emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer. Advantages of the laminate structure are that the efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased, that the efficiency of forming excited particles which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased, and that excited particles formed among the light emitting layer can be enclosed. As the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three "layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known. To increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the structure of the device and the process for forming the device have been studied.<br>
As the light emitting material of the organic EL device, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum, coumarine derivatives, tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives are known. It is reported that light in the visible region ranging from blue light to red light can be obtained by using these light emitting materials, and development of a device exhibiting color images is expected (For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. Heisei 8(l996)-239655, Heisei 7(1995)-138561 and Heisei 3(l99l)-200289).<br>
It is recently proposed that an organic phosphorescent materials is used in the light emitting layer of an organic EL device in combination with a light emitting material (for example, D. F. O'Brien, M. A. Baldo et<br>
2<br><br>
al., "Improved energy transfer in electrophosphorescent devices", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 74, No. 3, Pages 442 to 444, January 18, 1999; and M. A. Baldo et al., "Very high-efficiency green organic light-emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence", Applied Physics Letters, Vol, 75, No. 1, Pages 4 to 6, July 5, 1999).<br>
As described above, a great efficiency of light emission is achieved by utilizing an organic phosphorescent material excited to the singlet state and the triplet state in the light emitting layer of an organic EL device. It is considered that singlet excimers and triplet excimers are formed in relative amounts of 1:3 due to the difference in the multiplicity of spin when electrons and holes are recombined in an organic EL device. Therefore, it is expected that an efficiency of light emission 3 to 4 times as great as that of a device utilizing fluorescence alone can be achieved by utilizing a phosphorescent light emitting material.<br>
In the organic EL devices such as those described above, constructions in which layers such as an anode, an organic light emitting layer, an electron transporting layer (a hole blocking layer), an electron injecting layer and a cathode are successively laminated are used so that light emission in the condition excited to the triplet state or from excimers in the triplet state is not quenched (for example, the United States Patent No. 6,097,147, and International Patent Application Published under PCT No. WO01/41512). In these patent literature, 4,4-N,N dicarbazole biphenyl have been used as a host compound. However, there were problems that the host compound tends to crystallize because its glass transition temperature is 110 Â°C or less and further, because it is too symmetrical<br>
and that short circuit or pixel defect generates in the heat resistance test<br>
3<br><br>
of the organic EL device.<br>
Furthermore, it was found that a crystal growth generates at the position where there is a foreign matter or a protrusion of an electrode in an occasion of vapor deposition, and that the defects generate more than the primary stage before the heat resistance test. Still further, carbazole derivatives having a symmetry of order 3 are used as the host compound. However, it is too symmetrical to evade the crystal growth generation at the position where there is a foreign matter or a protrusion of an electrode in an occasion of vapor deposition, or to evade the defects generation more than the primary stage before the heat resistance test.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems. An object of the present invention is to provide materials for organic EL devices having an excellent efficiency of light emission, without pixel defects and superior in heat resistance. Another object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device utilizing the materials.<br>
As a result of extensive researches for overcoming the above problems, the inventors have found that organic EL devices made by using as a material therefor, a compound with poor symmetry are capable of achieving the above objects.

The glass substrate having the transparent electrode which had been cleaned was attached to a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus. On the surface of the cleaned substrate at the side having the transparent electrode, a film of copper phthalocyanine (referred to as "CuPc film", hereinafter) having a thickness of 10 nm was formed in a manner such that the formed film covered the transparent electrode. The formed CuPc film worked as the hole injecting layer. On the formed CuPc film, a film of 4,4'-bis [N-(4-biphenyl)-N-(4-biphenyD amino] biphenyl (referred to as "TBAB film", hereinafter) having a thickness of 30 nm was formed. The formed TBAB film worked as the hole transporting layer. On the formed TBAB film, a film of Compound (l) prepared above having a thickness of 40 nm<br><br>
was formed using Compound (l) as the host material, and the light emitting layer was formed. At the same time, tris(2-phenylpyridine)Ir (referred to as "(I-l)", hereinafter) was added as the Ir metal complex dopant emitting phosphorescent light. This film worked as the light emitting layer. The content of (I-l) in the light emitting layer was 5% by weight. On the film formed above, a film of (l,l'-bisphenyl)-4-olato)bis(2-methyl'8-quinolinolato)aluminum shown below (referred to as "BAlq film", hereinafter) having a thickness of 10 nm was formed. BAlq film worked as the hole barrier layer. On this film, a film of an aluminum complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline shown below (referred to as "Alq film", hereinafter) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed. Alq film worked as the electron injecting layer. Then, LiF which is an alkali metal halide was vapor deposited to form a film having a thickness of 0.2 nm. On the formed film, aluminum was vapor deposited to form a film having a thickness of 150 nm. The Al/LiF film worked as the cathode. An organic EL device was prepared in the manner described above.<br>

The device prepared above was examined by passing electric current. Green light was emitted at a luminance of 104 cd/m2 under a voltage of 5.2 V and a current density of 0.24 mA/cm2. The chromaticity coordinates were (0.32, 0.61), and the current efficiency was 42.6 cd/A. Further, current efficiency after storage at the temperature of 105 "C for<br>
500 hours was 41.6 cd/A, and light emitting surface was uniform without<br><br>
appearing any defect, revealing rectification ratio (forward electric current / reverse electric current) was 1  X   105 or greater. These results are<br>

Further, leak currents showing symptom of short circuit greatly appeared, and rectification ratio (forward electric current / reverse electric current) was 1 X 104 or smaller. Furthermore, after storage at the temperature of 105 *C for 500 hours, defects appeared over the light emitting surface, and the rectification ratio was 1 X 103 or smaller. Moreover, the luminance was only several cd/m2 which means remarkable degradation.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, it was verified that the organic EL device with the use of the material for organic EL device of the present invention emits green light with an enhanced current efficiency even after storage under an elevated temperature. It was also verified that because the material for the organic EL device of the present invention has high glass transition-temperature and because it has a symmetry of low order, the current efficiency exhibited almost no decrease and the rectification ratio was extremely as high as 1  X  105 or greater even after storage under an<br><br><br><br><br><br>
