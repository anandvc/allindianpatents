				<td>Pesticidal composition<br>
Technical Field The present invention relates to a pesticidal composition.<br>
Background Arts<br>
Pesticidal compositions containing two or more active ingredients are used for various objects.<br>
For example, though salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine are widely used as active ingredients of non-selective herbicides, they require time to express their herbicidal effects thus, proposed were some herbicidal compositions mixed with the other herbicidal ingredient having rapid efficacy. Typical herbicidal ingredient having rapid efficacy is a protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor. However, it is generally solid and water-insoluble though the salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine are freely soluble in water; thus it has been desired to develop the mixed herbicidal composition that has good formulation stability.<br>
USP-5,698,492, USP-6,583,087 and JP 2003-252704A discloses pesticidal compositions containing a water-insoluble herbicidal ingredient and another water-insoluble herbicidal ingredient.

The present pesticidal composition is generally an aqueous pesticidal flowable composition wherein the solid water-insoluble pesticidal ingredient is suspended in an aqueous continuous phase as a solid state. In the present pesticidal composition, the liquid phase consists essentially of<br><br>
the aqueous continuous phase. Namely, in the present pesticidal composition, the solid water-insoluble pesticidal ingredient substantially exists as fine particles and is surrounded by an aqueous continuous phase dissolving an N-phosphonomethylglycinate. The present pesticidal composition can be clearly distinguished from so-called suspoemulsion, wherein droplets of a water-insoluble solvent are dispersed in the aqueous continuous phase and the water-insoluble pesticidal ingredient is dispersed in the droplets as a solid state.<br>
The present pesticidal composition does not substantially comprise a water-insoluble organic solvent having lOg/L or less of water solubility at 20°C.<br>
The present pesticidal composition can be produced by making the particles of the solid pesticidal ingredient suspended uniformly in the solution comprising an N-phosphonomethylglycinate, first anionic surfactant, second anionic surfactant, thickener and water.<br>
The solid pesticidal ingredient is usually particles having 20 μ m or less of volume median diameter. The solid pesticidal ingredient having 20 ix m or less of volume median diameter may be prepared by a method of dry pulverizing! however, it is preferably prepared by wet pulverizing. When the solid pesticidal ingredient is prepared by wet pulverizing to make the volume median diameter 20 μ m or less, the present pesticidal composition is preferably produced by the following method.<br>
At first, the solid pesticidal ingredient is added to a mixture of the first anionic surfactant, the second anionic surfactant and water and wet pulverized to give a suspension of the pesticidal ingredient. The method for wet pulverizing is, for example, adding hard sphere beads such as glass beads to a mixture comprising the pesticidal ingredient, the first anionic surfactant, the second anionic surfactant and water, and stirring. Typically, wet pulverizing devises such as wet beads mill (e.g. dyno-mill) and sand grinder are used.<br>
Then, the thickener and the N-phosphonomethylglycinate, and further water if necessary, are added to the suspension of the pesticidal<br><br>
ingredient. Furthermore, auxiliaries for formulation such as antifreezing agent, preservative, stabilizer and coloring agent may be added. The present pesticidal composition can be produced by stirring the mixture well to be uniform.<br>
It is also preferable to add a thickener that is inorganic fine particles to the pesticidal ingredient at wet pulverizing and add a thickener that is a water soluble polysaccharide to the suspension containing the pesticidal ingredient after pulverizing.<br>
Further, a suspension containing the pesticidal ingredient can be prepared by adding the pesticidal ingredient to a mixture containing the second anionic surfactant and water and wet pulverizing. Then, the present pesticidal composition can be produced by adding the first anionic surfactant, thickener and N-phosphonomethylglycinate, and optionally water to the suspension containing the pesticidal ingredient.<br>
The present pesticidal composition is preferably a pesticidal composition wherein (a) 0.5 to 50w/v% of the water-insoluble solid pesticidal ingredient is suspended as a solid state in the aqueous continuous phase which consists essentially of (b) 5 to 60w/v% of an N-phosphonomethylglycinate, (c) 0.5 to 15w/v% of a first anionic surfactant, (d) 0.5 to 10w/v% of a second anionic surfactant, (e) 0.01 to 10w/v% of a thickener, (£) 20 to 90w/v% of water and (g) 0 to 30w/v% of an auxiliary for formulation such as an antifreezing agent, and more preferably a pesticidal composition wherein (a) 1 to 30w/v% of the water-insoluble solid pesticidal ingredient is suspended as a solid state in the aqueous continuous phase which consists essentially of (b) 10 to 50w/v% of an<br>
N-phosphonomethylglycinate, (c) 0.5 to 15w/v% of a first anionic surfactant, (d) 0.5 to 10w/v% of a second anionic surfactant, (e) 0.01 to 5w/v% of a thickener, (£) 20 to 90w/v% of water and (g) 0 to 20w/v% of an auxiliary for formulation such as an antifreezing agent.<br>
The present pesticidal composition can be used by diluted with water just before the application and applied in a sufficient amount for affording a desirable effect of the pesticidally active ingredient to soil, plants and so on.<br><br>
The present pesticidal composition can be used as a herbicide for crop field, fallow field, ridge between paddy fields, orchard, pasture, lawn, forest, non-cultivated land and so on, when the solid pesticidal ingredient is flumioxazin. In that case, the dosage depends on a mixing ratio of flumioxazin and an N-phosphonomethylglycinate, kind of the objective weeds, weather condition and so on, and the total amount of the active ingredients is usually 100-5000g, preferably 200-3000g per one hectare. When it is applied, the designated amount is diluted with 100-1000 liters of water per one hectare. The dilution is applied by a foliar treatment such as direct application to objective weeds.<br>
An auxiliary agent such as spreading agent may be optionally added to the dilution, and examples of the auxiliary agent include polyoxyethylene resin acid, salts of ligninsulfonic acid, paraffin and petroleum oil. The auxiliary agents on the market such as Agridex (crop oil concentrate produced by Helena) can also be used.<br>

Test example 1<br>
Each of the Pesticidal compositions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17 and 18 was charged into a lOOml-volume glass tube (diameter: 35mm, depth-110mm) and about 80% of the tubes were filled. It was allowed to stand at room temperature for two months. After that, all of the Pesticidal compositions were observed to be kept stable suspension state and not separated. Test example 2<br>
The Pesticidal composition 2 was charged into a lOOml-volume glass tube (diameter^ 35mm, depths 110mm) and about 80% of the tube were filled. It was allowed to stand at 54°C for one month. Then, it was observed<br>
to be separated a little at the top, but the height of the separated transparent layer is 4% of the whole composition. Test example 3<br>
Each of the Pesticidal compositions 12 and 13 and the reference pesticidal composition was charged into a lOOml-volume glass tube (diameter^ 35mm, depth: 110mm) and about 80% of the tubes were filled. It was allowed to stand for three days and observed. The results are given in Table 1.<br><br>

= [Height of the transparent part/layer (mm) / Height of the total (mm)] X 100<br>
Test example 4<br>
An aqueous dilution was prepared by diluting a designated amount of the Pesticidal composition 2 with water. The aqueous dilution was applied to common cocklebur {Xanthium pensylvanicuni), velvetleaf {Abutilon theophrastb, giant foxtail {Setaria faberi) and barnyardgrass {Echinochloa crus-galli) grown in the crop field by a foliar treatment at a rate of 236L/ha (2L/ha in the amount of the aqueous pesticidal flowable composition 2). The results of the observation 18 days after treatment are given in Table 2. The herbicidal activity is evaluated at 11 levels with indices of “0”, “1”, “2”, “3’, “4”, “5”, “6”, “7”, “8”, “9” and “10”, wherein 0 means that there was no or little difference in the degree of growth between the treated weeds and the untreated weeds at the time of evaluation, and 10 means that the weeds died completely or their growth was completely inhabited.
