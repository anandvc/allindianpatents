<br>
This invention relates to a device for supplying motive power, when required, to a manually driven bicycle, to significantly reduce human effort which would otherwise be needed for propelling the vehicle.<br>
The term "bicycle"used in this specification and Claims means and includes not only a bicycle properly so called, but, also manually propelled vehicles, such as, for example, tricycles, four wheelers and others to which this invention is applicable.<br>
The device proposed herein is readily attachable to, and detachable from, a bicycle and can thus be put into use whenever necessary or stowed away whenever it is not needed.<br>
The said device is operable on rechargeable electric batteries and does not give rise to pollution. In one of possible embodiments of this invention, the power requirement is about 250 W or 1/3 HP and will therefore be exempt from registration and road tax under present laws. The operating costs will also not be significantly<br>
 <br>
more than what is normally incurred in the case of the conventional bicycle.<br>
The device proposed makes it possible to ride the bicycle on level roads without pedaling, as well as on gradients by gentle pedaling. The vehicle can thus be described as one belonging to the hybrid category, running on human effort and on electric power:<br>
Various other features'of this invention will be apparent from the further description thereof to follow.<br>
The said device will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of this invention<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating a view of the said embodiment Fig. 2 illustrates a view of the overrunning clutch Fig. 3 illustrating the general assembly of the embodiment fitted to a bicycle<br>
An electric motor 1 which serves as a prime mover is coupled to a friction roller axle 2 by<br>
 <br>
means of a chain drive. The friction roller axle is mounted on ball bearings on frame 3. The friction roller 4 having a rough surface is supported on ball bearings on the friction roller axle 2 . The roller is spring loaded to keep the roller pressed to the rolling surface of the tyre. When the motor runs, it rotates the roller which in turn rotates the wheel of the vehicle due to the friction between the rough roller surface and the tyre to which it is pressed by the spring. Thus the motor is capable of propelling the bicycle.<br>
The overrunning clutch 5 shown in Fig.2 fixed to the friction roller axle 2 drives the friction roller in the forward direction of the vehicle while allowing the friction roller to overrun in the other direction. In other words the roller is driven by the overrunning clutch so that when the motor is de-energised the roller can continue to rotate with the cycle wheel without rotating the motor. Thus the motor can drive the roller but the roller rotation is not transmitted back to the motor when the vehicle is moving forward in a "freewheeling" action. By reason of this feature, it is possible to propel the vehicle by pedaling, in the normal manner, without the rider taking on the burden of the load assigned to the motor. This feature also protects the motor from<br>
 <br>
unnecessary wear and tear. Furthermore, in the event of a fault occurring in the proposed device, the rider will not be left stranded but can continue his journey by pedaling in the normal manner without suffering any strain other than what he would experience when pedaling on the conventional bicycle.<br>
In Fig. 3 the frame 3 of the motor friction-drive unit is attached to the mounting bracket through hinge pin 6 so that it is free to swing through a small angle about the hinge pin.<br>
A torsion spring 7 forces the frame 3 to swing downwards about the hinge pin 6 when the mounting bracket is fixed to the vehicle frame. This causes the friction roller to be pressed against the tyre-rolling surface of the bicycle wheel.<br>
The motor friction drive unit is mounted so that the friction roller is in firm contact with the front wheel tyre whereby the rotation of the friction roller would cause the front wheel to be driven by the friction generated between the roller and the wheel tyre. In cases of other embodiments of this invention, wherever it is possible to do so, at least one rear wheel of the vehicle will be<br>
 <br>
selected as the driven wheel in friction contact with the roller. In yet other cases both front and rear wheels will be selected as the driven wheels.<br>
The power supply unit is the weather-resistant battery-electronics pack 8 which is shown fixed to the horizontal strut of the bicycle frame. This pack contains a rechargeable battery, the motor control electronics and an encoder for translating the mechanical control command from the rider into an electric signal.<br>
The control lever 9 is connected to the encoder inside the power pack 8 by a cable. Operation of the lever 9 on the handle bar controls the power flow to the motor.<br>
The pack 8 has an ON/OFF switch and ON indicator lamp on it. The ON/OFF switch is of the type operated by turning a key in a keyhole. The said pack has a charging socket on it for recharging the battery. A low battery indicator is also provided.<br>
The electronics in the pack regulates the flow of power from the battery to the motor in accordance with the signal output of the<br>
 <br>
encoder. The electronics protects the motor by limiting the maximum current fed to the motor to a safe value regardless of the rider's command. The pack 8 is a narrow weather resistant box which can be slung from the horizontal tube of the bicycle frame running from the saddle support tube forward to the handle bar support tube. In this position the indicator lamps are readily visible to the rider. In a lady's bicycle the pack 8 will be slung from one side of he luggage carrier behind the saddle.<br>
Optionally a motor current indicator is provided. A socket is provided on the pack 8 for powering LED lamps for night riding and turn indicating flashers.<br>
It will be appreciated that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br>
