				<td>CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE<br>
OF DISPOSABLE ELECTRO-CHEMICAL SENSOR<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application retain to electrochemical sensors useful for detection and/or<br>
quantification of a target analyte in a sample.<br>
Disposable electrochemical sensors for monitoring of target analyses in blood<br>
or urine are well known. In particular, electrochemical measurement of the amount of<br>
glucose in a small amount of blood using disposable electrochemical seniors and<br>
small, portable meter, has become mainstay of many diabetics. These home-use<br>
systems permit routine measurements and provide the diabetic with an increased<br>
ability to self-manage his or her condition.<br>
The disposable electrochemical sensors used in these devices are generally<br>
formed as a series of patterned layers supported on a substrate. Mass production of<br>
these devices has been carried out by screen printing and other deposition processes,<br>
with the multiple layers making up the device being deposited seriatim in a batch<br>
process.<br>
Manufacture of disposable electrochemical sensors by these techniques has<br>
several drawbacks First, operation in batch mode is fundamentally inefficient.<br>
Multiple steps in the process requires the use of multiple print lines, one for each layer<br>
in the device. Not only does this increase the capital expense for the manufacturing<br>
equipment it also introduces multiple opportunities for process variation such as<br>
variable delays and storage conditions between print steps, as well as variations in the<br>
process itself such as registration drift between different process stations. Such<br>
process variations can result in poor calibration of some sensor batches resulting in<br>
potentially erroneous reading when the electrodes are used<br>
A potential second drawback arises from a characteristic inherent to screen<br>
printing, namely the thickness of the deposited layers Standard screen printing<br>
processes can be used to deposit layers from 1 to 100 µm in thickness Heat-cured<br>
resins can be used to obtain thinner layers of less than 1 µm in thickness. For printing<br><br>
electrodes, the capability of screen printing to produce layers with these dimensions is<br>
beneficial, since the thicker print has heater conductivity. For reagent layers, for<br>
example layers of enzymes which are utilized in many disposable electrochemical<br>
reactions, however, thick layers are detrimental to the reliable operation of the device.<br>
Specifically, because the amount of signal generated by a device of this type depends<br>
on the inter-reaction of these reagent and the target analyte within a very narrow<br>
region at the electrode surface, the use of reagent layers which extend beyond this<br>
region reduces the measured signal by depleting inwardly migrating analyte before it<br>
can reach the measurement zone.<br>
In view of these drawbacks, this is a need for a new approach to the<br>
manufacture of disposable electrochemical sensors. It is an object of the present<br>
invention to meet this need.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for manufacturing<br>
disposable electrochemical sensors which operates as a continuous process and which<br>
provides for deposition of thin reagent layers.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide cassettes which incorporate<br>
spooled sensors, including spooled sensors manufactured using the method of the<br>
invention.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide sensors which having an<br>
integrated sealing layer which is combination with the substrate produce a sealed<br>
sample receiving chamber, thereby producting the reagents until time of use, which<br>
sensors can be made using the method of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other objects of the invention are met by a method in accordance<br>
with the invention for manufacturing electrochemical sensors. The sensors comprises<br>
a substrate, an electrode layer and at least a first reagent layer. The method comprises<br>
the steps of transporting a continuous web of the substrate past at least two print<br>
stations, and printing the electrode layer and the first reagent layer on the substrate.<br>
One of the print stations prints the electrode layer on the continuous web of substrate,<br>
and the other of the pnnt stations prints the first reagent layer on the continuous web<br><br>
of substrate as it is transported past the print stations. Additional print stations may be<br>
included for the printing of insulation layers, glue prints and the like. The older of<br>
printing will depend on the structure desired for the sensor, although the electrode<br>
layer(s) will frequently be deposited before the reagent layer(s).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for manufacturing electrochemical<br>
sensors using a continuous web of substrate transported past a plurality of printing<br>
stations for deposition of various layers making up the sensor. The method can be<br>
used tor making sensors which are directed to any electrochemically-defectable<br>
analyte.<br><br>
Exemplary analytes of particular commercial significance for which sensors<br>
can be made using the method include; glucose, fructosamine, HbAIC, lactate,<br>
cholesterol, alcohol and ketones.<br>
The specific structure of the electrochemical sensor will depend on the nature<br>
of the analyte. In general, however, each device will include an electrode layer and at<br>
least one reagent layer deposited on a substrate. As used in the specification and<br>
claims hereof, the term layer" refers to a coating applied to all or part of the surface<br>
of the substrate. A layer is considered to be "applied to" or "printed on" the surface of<br>
the substrate when it is applied directly to the substrate or the surface of a layer or<br>
layers previously applied to the substrate. Thus, deposition of two layers on the<br>
substrate may resulr in a three layer sandwich (substrate, layer 1, and layer 2) as<br>
shown in Fig. 1A or in the deposition of two parallel traces as shown in Fig. 1B, as<br>
well as intermediate configurations with partial overlap.<br>
In the method of the invention, the electrochemical sensors are printed in a<br>
linear array, or as a plurality of parallel linear arrays onto a flexible web substrate. As<br>
discussed below, this web may be processed by cutting it into ribbons after the<br>
formation . As used in the specification and claims of this application, the term<br>
"ribbon" refers to a portion of the printed web which has been formed by cutting the<br>
web in either or both of the longitudinal and tranverse directions, and which has a<br>
plurality of electrochemical sensors printed thereon<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B show the structure of an electrochemical sensors for detection<br>
of glucose in accordance with in the invention. On the substrate 10 are placed a<br>
conductive base layer 16, a working electrode track 15, a reference electrode track 14,<br>
and conductive contacts 11, 12, and 13. An insulating mask 18 is then formed,<br>
leaving a portion of the conductive base layer 16, and the contacts 11, 12 and 13<br>
exposed. A reagent layer of a working coating 17, for example a mixture of glucose<br>
oxidase and a redox mediator, is then applied over the insulating mask 18 to make<br>
contact with conductive base layer 16. Additional reagent layers can be applied over<br>
working coating 18 if desired. For example, the enzyme and the redox mediator can<br>
be applied in separate layers<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the specific structure shown in Figs. 2A and 28 is<br>
merely exemplary and that the method of the invention can be used to manufacture<br>
electrochemical sensors for a wide variety of analytes and using a wide variety of<br>
electrode/reagent configurations Exemplary sensors which could be manufactured<br>
using the method of the invention include those disclosed in European Patent No<br>
0 127 958, and US Pawils Nos. 5.141.868, 5,286,362, 5,288,636, and 5,437,999,<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic view of an apparatus for practicing the invention. A<br>
running web of substrate 31 is provided on a feed roll 32 and is transported over a<br>
plurality of print stations 33, 34, and 35, each of which prints a different layer onto the<br>
substrate. The number of print stations can be any number and will depend on the<br>
number of layers required for the particular device being manufactured. Between<br>
successive print stations, the web is preferably transported through a dryer 36, 37, and<br>
38 (for example a forced hot air or infra-red dryer), to dry each layer before<br>
proceeding to the deposition of the next. After, the final dryer 38, the printed web is<br>
collected on a take up roll or introduced directly into a post-processing apparatus 39<br>
While the most efficient embodiments of the invention will generally use a<br>
plurality of pnnt stations as illustrated in Fig. 3 for the printing of different materials,<br>
it will be appreciated that many of the Advantages of the invention can be achieved<br>
with a process in which a single print station is used several times with different pnnt<br>
reagents. In particular, benefits of increased throughput and improved print<br>
registration are obtained when using the same print station multiple times. Thus, as<br>
used in the specification and claims of this application, the phrase "at least two print<br>
stations" refers both to embodiments in which two or more distinct print stanons axe<br>
employed and to embodiments in which a common print station is used in several<br>
passes to pnnt the required materials onto the substrate.<br>
As noted above, one of the most important parameters to control when printing<br>
the various layers of a bionsesor is the thickness of the deposited layer, particularly<br>
with respect to the reagent layer The thickness of the printed layer is influenced by<br>
various factors, including the angle at which the substrate and the screen are<br>
separated In a conventional card printing process, where the substrate is presented as<br><br>
individual cards on a flat table, this angle varies as the squeegee moves across the<br>
screen, leading to variations in thickness and therefore to variations in the sensor<br>
response across the card. To minimize this source of variation, the print stations used<br>
in the method of the present invention preferably makes use of cylinder screen<br>
printing or rotogravure printing<br>
In cylinder screen printing, a flexible substrate is presented to the underside of<br>
a screen bearing the desired image using a cylindrical roller and moves synchronously<br>
with the squeegee. Unlike conventional printing, where the screen moves away from<br>
a stationary substrate, in this process the moving substrate is pulled away from the<br>
screen. This allows a constant separation angle to be maintained, so that a uniform<br>
thickness of deposit is achieved. What is more, the contact angle, and thus the print<br>
thickness can be optimized by choosing the appropriate point of contact, By<br>
appropriate optimization, the process can be engineered so that the ink is puuled out<br>
of the screen and transferred to the substrate much more efficiently. This sharper<br>
"peel off" leads to much improved print accuracy, allowing a finer detail print.<br>
Therefore smaller electrodes can be printed and smaller overall sensors can be<br>
achieved.<br>
The post-processing apparatus 39 may perform any of a variety of treatments,<br>
or combinations of treatments on the printed web. For example, the post processing<br>
apparatus may apply a cover over the electrochemical devices by laminating a second<br>
continuous web to the printed substrate. The postprocessing apparatus may also cut<br>
the printed web into smaller segments. To produce individual electrochemical<br>
devices of the type generally employed in known hand-held glucose meters, this<br>
cutting process would generally involve cutting the web in two directions,<br>
longitudinally and laterally. The use of continuous web technology offers the<br>
opportunity to make electrochemical sensors with different configurations which offer<br>
advantages for packaging and use.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the printed web can be cut into a plurality of longitudinal<br>
ribbons, each one sensor wide. These ribbons can in rum be cut into shorter ribbons<br>
of convenient lengths, for example, 10, 25, 50 or even 100 sensors. These ribbons<br>
may be rolled into spools and packaged into a cassette which is inserted into a meter<br><br>
(Fig. 5A). Alternatively,a short ribbon of say 5 strips can be prepared 10 provide<br>
enough sensors for one normal day of resting. For this length a cassette is probably<br>
not necessary, although it could be provided if desired. In either case, the sensors are<br>
used one and a lime, and moved into the appropriate position at the time of use<br>
Preferably, this movement is accomplished by a meter-resident mechanism, which<br>
also prevents used strips from being drawn back inside the meter<br>
The use of spooled ribbons with multiple sensors has substantial advantages<br>
over the known systems using single electrochemical sensots. Because the spooled<br>
electrochemical devices are packaged inside a cassette, they are less susceptible to<br>
damage. Further, since the spool of devices is a continuous strip and is not intended<br>
to be removed from the cassette prior to use, there is less likelihood that a sensor with<br>
be used with the wrong calibration codes. The risk of erroneous calibration values<br>
can be further reduced if the cassette and the meter interact to provide calibration<br>
values for the sensors contained within the cassette. Interactions of this type are<br>
described for individual sensor devices in International Patent Publication No.<br>
W097/29847 and US Patent Application No. 08/600,449 which are used herein by<br>
reference.<br>
A further advantage of continuous spools of electrochemical sensors is the<br>
ability to make each individual smaller. Much of the size of known individual sensors<br>
is driven by a requirement that the user be able to manipulate the sensor for insertion<br>
in the meter. Use of a continuous spool of sensors eliminates these constraints on the<br>
size of the device since the user will be manipulating the cassette or ribbon of<br>
electrochemical sensors which will be significantly easier to handle than individual<br>
strips. Thus, the present invention permits the fabrication of smaller and therefore<br>
more economical devices.<br>
If it is desired to separate used devices from the spool, a cutter may be<br>
incorporated into the meter or into the cassette. A cutter of this type is disclosed in<br>
US Parent No. 5,525,297, which is incorporated herein by reference, although other<br>
configurations could be employed.<br>
Fig. 5B shows variation of the meter of Fig 5A. In this case, the cassette<br>
includes a take up mechanism such that the sensor spool is transferred from a feed<br><br>
spool 51 to a take up spool 52 as it is used. This makes the entire cassette system self-<br>
contained and eliminates the need to dispose of individual sensors which have<br>
frequently been contaminated with blood.<br>
The method of the invention can also be used to produce sensor spools having<br>
parallel arrays of sensors of different types. Thus, as shown in Fig. 6, a sensor strip<br>
could be prepared in which sensors of a first type, 61 are disposed alongside sensors<br>
of a second type, 62 By providing separate contacts and analysis circuitry for each<br>
sensor, two values can be determined simultaneously in the same meter with the same<br>
sample. Suitable analyte pairs include glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin; and<br>
LDL and HDL. Two different sensors measuring levels of the same analyte might<br>
also be employed to provide and internal check, or to increase the dynamic range of<br>
the strip.<br>
The method of the invention also facilitates the manufacture of sensors having<br>
structures which cannot be conveniently produced using conventional batch<br>
processing. For example, as shown in Figs. 7A and 7B, a device can be manufactured<br>
by depositing parallel conductive tracks 71 and 72; reagent layer(s) 71 and an<br>
insulation layer 74 on a substrate 70. The substrate is then folded along a fold line<br>
disposed between the two conductive tracks to produce a sensor in which two co-<br>
facial electrodes are separated by a reagent layer An electrode geometry of this type<br>
is beneficial because the voltage drop due to solution resistance is low as a result of<br>
the thin layer of solution separating the electrodes In contrast, in a conventional<br>
device with coplanar electrodes, the use of a thin layer of solution results in a<br>
substantial voltage drop along the length of the cell and concomitant uneven current<br>
distribution. Furthermore the device of Figs. 7A and 7B can be cut across the<br>
deposited reagent to produce a very low volume chamber for sample analysis which<br>
further improves the performance of the device.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing discussion, the method of the present<br>
invention provides a very versatile approach for manufacture of electrochemical<br>
sensors. The following discussion of suitable materials which can be used in the<br>
method of the invention is intended to further exemplify this versatility and not to<br>
limit the scope of the invention which is defined by the claims<br><br>
The substrate used in the method of the invention may be any dimensionally<br>
stable material of sufficient flexibility to permit its transport through an apparatus of<br>
the type shown generally in Fig 3. In general the substrate will be an electrical<br>
insulator, although this is not necessary if a layer of insulation is deposited between<br>
the substrate and the electrodes. The substrate should also be chemically compatible<br>
with the materials which will be used in the printing of any given sensor. This means<br>
that the substrate should not significantly react with or be degraded by these materials,<br>
although a reasonably stable print image does need to be formed. Specific examples of<br>
suitable materials include polycarbonate and polyester.<br>
The electrodes may be formed of any conductive material which can be<br>
deposited in patterns in a continuous printing process. This would include carbon<br>
electrodes and electrodes formed from platinised carbon, gold, silver, and mixtures of<br>
silver and silver chloride.<br>
Insulation layers are deposited as appropriate to define the sample analysis<br>
volume and to avoid a short circuiting of the sensor. Insulating materials which can<br>
be printed are suitable, including for example polyester-based inks.<br>
The selection of the constituents of the reagent layer(s) will depend on the<br>
target analyte. For detection of glucose, the reagent layer(s) will suitably include an<br>
enzyme capable of oxidizing glucose, and a mediator compound which transfers<br>
electrons from the enzyme to the electrode resulting in a measurable current when<br>
glucose is present. Representative mediator compounds include ferricyanide,<br>
metallocene compounds such as ferrocene, quinones, phenazinium salts, redox<br>
indicator DCP1P, and imidazole-substituted osmium compounds. The reagents<br>
appropriate to other types of sensors will be apparent to persons skilled in the an.<br>
One of the limitations of any device in which multiple test elements are stored<br>
within a test device is that the elements must be made stable for the expected lifetime<br>
of the test elements within the test device. In general, for electrochemical sensor<br>
strips, this means providing a moisture-proof and air-tight environment for unused<br>
sensor strips. This can be accomplished through the design of the cassene and<br>
associated meter, or it may be accomplished by adding a sealing layer to the test<br><br>
ribbon so that individual test strips are individually sealed and protected from<br>
moisture.<br>
Figs 8 A-C relate to ribbons of test strips with a sealing layer. Fig. 8A shows<br>
a composite structure comprising a lower layer ribbon of test strips 80 and an upper<br>
sealing layer 81. The upper sealing layer 81 is shown partially peeled back to expose<br>
the first test element. The upper layer contains apertures 82 through which electrical<br>
contact with the underlying test strip can be made. The sealing layer 81 is typically<br>
attached to the ribbon 80 using a hot melt or pressure-sensitive adhesive. The meter<br>
employed with the sealed test strip ribbon of Fig. 8A would include a mechanism,<br>
such as a knife blade, for peeling back the sealing layer 81 to expose the target area of<br>
a strip that is about to be used- After use the used test strip and the peeled back<br>
sealing layer may be cut away from lie unused portion of the nbbon, for example<br>
using a cutter blade integral to the cassette The used strips and peeled of sealing<br>
layer might also be rolled up onto take-up spools within a cassette as shown in Fig.<br>
8B, thus avoiding the need for a user to contact used strips directly.<br>
Fig 8C shows a variation on the structure of Fig. 8C. In this case, the sealant<br>
layer serves as one wall of the test strip sample chamber. This geometry has certain<br>
advantages, notably that evaporative cooling of the sample (which can lead to<br>
erroneously low readings) is reduced. To prepare a test strip on a nbbon of this type<br>
for use, a cut is made which opens the end of a chamber formed by the sealing layer<br>
81 and the test stnp ribbon 80. In Fig. 8C, separate cut line-types 88 and 89 are<br>
shown for separating used devices, and for opening a new device, respectively. These<br>
cuts can be made at the same type or at different times.<br><br>
