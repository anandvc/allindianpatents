Still another disadvantage is that some of the conventional fixture does not make accurate key way on shaft and alignment is also not accurate.<br>
Another disadvantage is that some of the conventional fixture required lots of time for centring the cylindrical shaft.<br>
Objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a Fixture to hold cylindrical means ' which produces the keyway at center of the shaft, rotor of submersible pump, hollow pipe etc. more precisely and efficiently with neither any index marking left on shaft nor collapsing of pipe during gripping of shaft by eye bolt.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide Fixture to hold cylindrical means, (which produces the keyway on larger diameter shaft as compare to the conventional mean of tool post on lathe bed.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide Fixture to hold cylindrical means, which is low in cost, easy in operation.<br>
&gt; Still another object of the present invention is to provide Fixture to hold cylindrical<br>
means, which saves considerable amount of time for centering of shaft in front of the<br>
cutter blade attached to headstock of lathe machine.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved mechanism for attaching conduit coupling to lengths of conduit.<br>
3<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an improved fixture adapted to more accurately align conduit couplings with lengths of conduit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved fixture adapted to reduce damage to conduit.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved fixture adapted to reduce reprocessing costs associated with prior art.<br>
:The following description contains many specifics; these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible accordingly the scope of the invention should not -be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
' Statement of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a fixture to hold cylindrical means comprising a hollow cube, said cube being opened at two opposite vertical sides, an eye-bolt being provided to hold the cylindrical means, head of said eye bolt being provided at front open side of the said cube, tail end of the said eye bolt being secured with rectangular plate movably at back open end of the said cube, a v-slot being provided at front of the left and right vertical sides of the cube, a vertical support being provided between the right and left vertical sides and connected with horizontals sides a hollow pipe being secured at the center of the horizontal sides of the cube, a stopper being fitted<br>
with right side of the cube. I<br>
Brief description of invention<br>
In accordance with this invention a fixture to hold cylindrical means comprising a hollow<br>
cube. The cube is made through two "L" shaped block. The cube is opened through front<br>
 vertical side and back vertical side of the cube, which are opposite two each other.  An<br>
4<br><br>
eye-bolt is provided inside the cube horizontally. The head of the eye bolt is provided at the front side of the cube to hold the cylindrical means and provide the tight grip to the different size of cylindrical means. Tail end of the eye bolt is secured with rectangular plate movably at back open end of the cube. A v-slot of same size and shape is provided at front vertical end of the right vertical side and left vertical side of the cube. V-slot is provided at the center of the vertical end of the vertical sides. A hole is provided at the center of the horizontal sides. Horizontal sides are connected through a hollow pipe at the center inside the cube. A vertical support is provided between the right and left vertical sides and connected with horizontals sides inside the cube to give grip to the cylindrical means. A stopper is provided at the right vertical side of the cube which is connected â– ' through a connector.<br>
Detailed description of invention<br>
The fixture to hold cylindrical means according to a preferred embodiment is herein<br>
described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein; )<br>
Fig. I shows the perspective view of the fixture with cylindrical means/shaft Fig.2 shows the perspective view of the fixture without cylindrical means/shaft Fig.3 shows the perspective view of the fixture from backside Fig.4 shows the left side view of the fixture I Fig.5 shows the front view of the fixture<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig 1 and 2, a Fixture to hold cylindrical means has a hollow cube (1). The cube (1) is made through two "L" shaped block (2). The cube (1) is opened through front vertical side (3) and back vertical side (4) of the cube (1), which .are opposite two each other. An eye-bolt (5) is provided inside the cube (1) horizontally. The head (6) of the eye bolt (5) is provided at the front vertical side (3) of the cube (1) to hold the cylindrical means (7) such that it provides the tight grip to the different size of cylindrical means (4). Tail end (8) of the eye bolt (5) is secured with rectangular plate (9) movably at back vertical side (4) of the cube (1). A 90Â° v-slot (10) of same size and shape<br>
5<br><br>
, is provided at the center of the front vertical end of the right vertical side (11) and left vertical side (12) of the cube (1).<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig 3,4 and 5, a hole (13) is provided at the center of the horizontal sides (14 and 15) which are connected through a hollow pipe (16) at the center inside the cube (1) such that this arrangement allow to pass the bolt (not shown) to fix the lixture/cube (1). The hollow pipe (16) is provided vertically inside the cube to prevent bending and collapsing of cube (1) when fitted. A stopper (17) is provided at the right vertical side (1 1) of the cube (1) which is connected through a connector (18) for gear indexing. A vertical support (19) having a v-slot (not shown) is provided inside the cube (I) near the centre of horizontal sides (14 and 15) and located towards the front side â€¢to give grip to the cylindrical means (7)<br>
During the operation of the device, the fixture is fitted on the lathe-bad through the hollow pipe and hole provided on the horizontal sides. A Cylindrical means on which (keyway is required to make, is fitted on the fixture with the help of the V-slot, Eye bolt and the vertical support having a v slot. This arrangement makes the centers of the cutter blade and cylindrical means match with each other.<br>
Manufacturing of gear is also possible by this fixture by putting blank on which tooth is required to cut on metal shaft at one end towards the cutter blade and a master gear on other end of metal shaft towards the stopper bolt. This metal shaft, blank and master gear are placed on the fixture such that blank remains in front of the cutter blade of lathe and indexing is done by putting stopper bolt on tooth of master gear.<br><br>
