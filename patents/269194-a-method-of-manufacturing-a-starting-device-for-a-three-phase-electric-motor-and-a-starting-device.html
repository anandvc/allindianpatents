				<td>Description<br>
A method of manufacturing a starting device for a three-phase<br>
electric motor, and a starting device<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to manufacturing of starting devices<br>
for three-phase electric motors especially in the higher<br>
power range suitable for operating currents larger than 29 A,<br>
and to such starting devices.<br>
Background axt<br>
If a three-phase electric motor is started directly or using<br>
star-delta starting, unpleasant side-effects such as<br>
mechanical impacts inside the machine or voltage dips in the<br>
power supply system may be encountered.<br>
To avoid these adverse effects, a so-called soft starter may<br>
be used to start-up or ramp-down a three-phase electric<br>
motor. With a soft starter, mechanical loads in the operating<br>
mechanism can be reduced, causing also less strain to the<br>
power supply system. In this manner, simple and economically<br>
more efficient use of the motor and machinery and equipment<br>
connected thereto may be achieved.<br>
A soft starter may need to be able to switch very large<br>
currents, especially if it has been adapted to start-up or<br>
ramp-down a larger motor. For example, SIEMENS soft starter<br>
SIRIUS 3RW44 is currently capable to operate a motor with a<br>
power of 710 kW at 400 V in an inline circuit, and up to 1200<br>
kW at 400 V in an inside-delta circuit. This means that<br>
switching must be performed for single-phase currents<br>
exceeding 1000 A which is a very challenging task.<br>
Contactors, especially air contactors, are commonly used in a<br>
soft starter to protect the soft starter against electric arc<br><br>
and to protect the motor and machinery and equipment<br>
connected thereto against adverse effects of a bypass.<br>
The fact that contactors used in soft starters for the higher<br>
power range (for currents 29 - 1200 A and higher) are usually<br>
relatively large results in a correspondingly larger volume<br>
of the housing of a soft starter, thus increasing the<br>
material cost and making installation of the device more<br>
difficult and space-consuming.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
A first objective of the invention is to enable reducing the<br>
size of a starting device for an electric motor or to enable<br>
increasing the size of electronics cooling system in a<br>
starting device without increasing the size of the starting<br>
device. This objective can be met with a manufacturing method<br>
as set out in claim 1.<br>
A second objective of the invention is to bring out a<br>
starting device for an electric motor that may have a smaller<br>
size. This objective can be met with a starting device as set<br>
out in claim 6.<br>
Dependent claims describe various advantageous aspects of<br>
different aspects of the invention.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
If in manufacturing a starting device for a three-phase<br>
electric motor, especially a soft starter, arc quenching<br>
system is at least partly removed from a commercially<br>
available contactor that so becomes modified contactor which<br>
is then used as contactor in the starting device, the<br>
starting device may be made smaller, or the thus available<br>
more space may be used for cooling the starting device,<br>
especially if the starting device has an electronic control<br>
unit.<br><br>
A particularly advantageous benefit is that since the<br>
contactors need not be specially manufactured, the cost for<br>
manufacturing the starting device can be kept low.<br>
In particular, the starting device may be made smaller by<br>
removing an arc splitter chamber completely or in part, since<br>
the arc splitter chamber is usually relatively large. Further<br>
size reduction can be obtained if at least one de-ion plate<br>
is removed.<br>
The starting device may be made more stabile and robust<br>
against external forces, such as strain and torque, if<br>
external contact members of the starting device are connected<br>
to contact members of the modified contactor. The stability<br>
may be further improved by connecting an electronic control<br>
unit in parallel to said modified contactor from contact<br>
members of the modified contactor or from contact members of<br>
the starting device.<br>
Because the modified contactor is smaller than the<br>
commercially available contactor, it becomes easier to make<br>
the parallel connection for the electronic control unit since<br>
it the contact members become better accessible.<br>
In particular, if said commercially available contactor is an<br>
air contactor, the space saving may be considerable.<br>
List of drawings<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in more<br>
detail with reference to examples in the accompanying<br>
drawings in Figures 1 to 3, of which:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a starter device;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a commercially available contactor; and<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a modified contactor.<br><br>
Same reference numerals refer to similar structural elements<br>
throughout the Figures.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Figure 1 shows a starting device 100 that is a soft starter.<br>
The starting device 100 may be connected to power lines (not<br>
shown) via its contact members 101, of which there is<br>
preferably one contact member 101 for each phase, and to a<br>
three-phase electric motor (not shown) via its contact<br>
members 102, likewise of which there is preferably one<br>
contact member 102 for each phase.<br>
The starting device 100 comprises a user interface unit 110<br>
that preferably remains visible from the cover (not shown) of<br>
the housing. The user may control the functioning of the<br>
starting device 100 via the user interface unit 110, e.g. set<br>
the operation current of the motor, or command the starting<br>
device 100 to start-up or ramp-down the electric motor.<br>
The starting device 100 further comprises an electronic<br>
control unit 120 that in Figure 1 is shown partly covered by<br>
a support panel 130. The electronic control unit 120<br>
preferably comprises thyristors that may be used to control<br>
the start-up or ramp-down current of the electric motor which<br>
is sometimes referred to as semiconductor control.<br>
In particular, the starting device 100 is adapted to switch<br>
the current instead of the electronic control unit 120 by<br>
contactor 200B as soon as the operation current of the motor<br>
has been reached or is about to be reached. The main reason<br>
for this is that a contactor 200B has much better energy<br>
efficiency than the semiconductor control, where heat<br>
dissipation of up to 3 W/A may be encountered, which would<br>
cause extensive heating up of the starting device with norm<br>
operating current of 880 A, for example.<br><br>
The contactor 200B is preferably contacted to the power lines<br>
and the motor by contacting its contact members 215, 225 to<br>
contact members 101, 102, respectively.<br>
Figure 2 shows a commercially available contactor 200 that<br>
has been used in prior start devices. The commercially<br>
available contactor 200 is preferably suitable to be used<br>
within the higher power range, i.e. with currents larger than<br>
29 A. A commercially available contactor 200 usually<br>
comprises a mounting base 210, a contactor part 220, and an<br>
arc quenching system 230. According to one aspect of the<br>
invention, before or during construction of the starting<br>
device 100, a commercially available contactor 200 is first<br>
.modified to a modified contactor 200B and the modified<br>
contactor 200B is then used as contactor when assembling the<br>
starting device 100.<br>
Figure 3 shows a modified contactor 200B. When performing the<br>
modifying, arc quenching system 230 is at least partly but<br>
preferably fully removed from the commercially available<br>
contactor 200 that so becomes to a modified contactor 200B.<br>
For SIRIUS 3RT14 air contactors, for example, this can be<br>
performed with a screw driver, since the arc quenching system<br>
is in a particular module that has been attached to the<br>
contactor 200 by screws. Sawing or other more powerful<br>
measures can nevertheless be used alone or in combination<br>
with the screw driver to get rid of the arc quenching system<br>
230 or to make it smaller. Depending on the contactor 200, in<br>
the modified contactor 200B the movable contact elements 240<br>
may thus become visible.<br>
Basically, the art quenching system 230 comprises an arc<br>
splitter chamber which may be a chamber filled with air. The<br>
arc splitter chamber may further comprise a series of de-ion<br>
plates, the function of which is to split the voltage causing<br>
the electric arc to smaller voltages, thereby efficiently<br>
eliminating the electric arc. Some or all walls of the arc<br><br>
splitter chamber may thus be removed, and if still more size<br>
reduction is necessary, some or preferably all of the de-ion<br>
plates may be dismounted or removed, fully or in part.<br>
That the modified contactor 200B does not comprise an arc<br>
quenching system 230 any more does not cause a problem, since<br>
during starting-up and ramping-down of the motor, the current<br>
is controlled by the electronic control unit 120 through<br>
thyristors, where usually no arcing will take place.<br>
After finishing starting-up, when the current fed to the<br>
motor has reached the operation current, the electronic<br>
control unit 120 and the modified contactor 200B are run in<br>
parallel for a moment before the current is passed fully<br>
through the modified contactor 200B. Because the switching<br>
from the electronic control unit 120 to the modified<br>
contactor 200B does not involve change of load, there will be<br>
no arcing.<br>
Before starting ramping-down, the electronic control unit 120<br>
and the modified contactor 200B are again run in parallel<br>
before the current is passed fully through the electronic<br>
control unit 120. Because the switching from the electronic<br>
control unit 120 to the modified contactor 200B does not<br>
involve change of load, there will be no arcing.<br>
Even though the invention has been described by using<br>
particular examples, the skilled person readily appreciates<br>
that the invention is by no means limited to these but can be<br>
interpreted within the scope and spirit of the accompanying<br>
claims.<br>
In particular, the commercially available contactor 200 may<br>
be an air contactor.<br><br>
