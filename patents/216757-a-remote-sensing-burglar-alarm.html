				<td>The subject invention relates to a remote sensing burglar alarm.<br>
Various forms of alarm have been proposed for audibly or visually attracting a person's attention in the event of burglary. The serious drawback found in these existing alarms is that the moment burglar tries to break open the automobile, the siren starts blowing giving the burglar the chance to escape.<br>
Moreover, the conventional alarms available in the market are very bulky and not workable. The power dissipations are found to be more in such available devices. More so over, the circuitry is complex, the propagation delay is more and the switching speed is found to be less. The conventional device is not suitable to be installed on the door of the automobile as the voltage supply to said device is Direct Current and not the Alternative Current.<br>
In the existing alarm devices it is not easy to pin point an automobile being tempered in the parking lot.<br>
In order to catch hold of the burglar, the remote sensing alarm of the subject invention has been devised , where there is no audible voice at the point where the automotive is parked but an indication is made where the owner of the car is present. Thus, giving the owner ample opportunity to get hold of the burglar and save his automobile.<br>
The object of the invention is to catch the burglar red-handed while attempting on the automobile, residential property, place of business and the like.<br>
The alarm of the subject invention is very simple in circuit, easily operatable and cost-effective.<br>
The remote sensing alarm of the subject invention comprises a switch which is attached to the fixed part of the automobile and the alarm circuit with the transmitter attached to the door of the automobile. A receiver is carried by the<br><br>
owner of the automobile when the automobile is parked and he is away from the same.<br>
In the event somebody tries to break -into the automobile , the contact between the circuit is broken and the alarm is triggered on which is transmitted into the transmitter's modulator input which modulates the frequency of the carrier in accordance with the instantaneous voltage of the audio transmitted to the recipient via air.<br>
This transmitted signal is received by a tuned receiver, which is then demodulated and fed to the power amplifier, which amplifies the signal to reasonably high level. The signal so received is transmitted to a speaker which produces the alarming sound audible by the holder of the said receiver, cautioning the owner of the automobile about the opening of the door of the automobile.<br>
Accordingly, the subject invention relates to a remote sensing burglar alarm having a range of upto 2-3 kms. comprising an alarm circuit, means for modulating, amplifying and transmitting the signal received from the said alarm circuit, means for receiving, demodulating and amplifying the said transmitted signals to the desired frequency and the means for converting the said amplified signals into an audible sound signal, wherein the impedance of the output terminals of the said alarm circuit are in synchronism with the impedance of input terminals of the said transmitter circuit, the said alarm circuit comprises a magnetically susceptible reed switch connected in series to a transmitter, and the said means for modulating, amplifying and transmitting comprises a plurality of modulators, an integrator, an amplifier and an antenna.<br>
The alarm circuit comprises a magnetically susceptible reed switch connected in series to a transmitter comprising a plurality of modulators, an integrator, an amplifier and an antenna.<br>
The modulators used are selected from phase modulator, amplitude modulator and frequency modulator.<br><br>
The phase modulators .are being fed signals   by the crystal oscillator and integrator.<br>
The amplitude mpdulatQrs gives modulated signal -to4he. -integrator,..<br>
The   frequency   modulator   modulates  the   signal   received   from   phase modulation to desired frequency.<br>
A   power amplifier is connected to the frequency amplifier to amplify the signal, the output of which is sent to an antenna.<br>
The recevier comprise a mixer receiving signal  from RF tune amplifier  and from an oscillator. V<br>
A discriminator is  provided in series with the mixer through RF tune amplifier and RF tune limitation amplifier, the output of which is fed to audio amplifier and then to speaker.<br>
The subject invention may better be understood with reference to the accompanying drawings , which are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed to restrict the scope of invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 relates to Alarm Circuit Figure 2 relates to Transmitter Circuit Figure 3 relates to Receiver Circuit Figure 4 relates to Audio Amplifier Circuit<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the alarm circuit of subject invention, as shown in figure 1, a magnet/reed switch is used , where "T" is an on/off position detector arranged to indicate when the reed switch is in certain position with respect to a magnet. The<br><br>
switch contact are normally open and one of the reeds must be magnetically susceptible. When the switch enters a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the reed contacts snap closed and remain closed as long as they stay in the magnetic filed. The closed contacts actuate a buzzer/alarm or light emitting device .<br>
The "M" is a music integrated circuit which produces alarm when actuated. The voltage is applied at the outer terminals such that its terminals corresponding to emitter is the positive terminal and the terminal corresponding to collector is negative , an audio output is produced at the third terminal i.e. corresponding to base. The audio is amplified by the transistor "T" which acts as an amplifier for the signal. The output terminals of the alarm circuit are matched with input terminals of the Transmitter circuit to match their impedance.<br>
In the transmitter circuit as shown in figure 2, when the reed switch is closed by the magnet, a coupled oscillator in the transmitter is activated, generating square waves, which are conducted through the antenna. The Resistor R1 and R2 are in a ratio of 1:10 with the capacitor C1 in microfarads so that large current flows through the resistor R1 and the output is increased /reduced through R1-C1 combination, from the input terminal. The variable Resistor VR1 is in parallel to the input signal through the alarm circuit which is used to vary the frequency of the signal. The resistor R3 is of a large value so that the less current flows through it and more current flows through capacitor C9 which is in picofarads so that the current to the collector of Transistor "TV is large and the Transistor operates in active region, otherwise it would have gone to either cut-off region or saturation region. Resistor R4 and Capacitor C2 are in parallel for adjusting the net reactance for the Transistor T1 to act as an oscillator circuit and thus produce a frequency which oscillates about a mean frequency of operation. Resistor R5 is connected across the emitter junction of the Transistor T1. The capacitor C3 is earthed so that any fluctuations in the circuit are reduced to a minimum. The inductance L1 is a<br><br>
gauge wire whose number of turns are adjusted for the best reception of the signal.<br>
Also the inductor L2 is a gauge wire which is near the top end of the inductor of the L1. Resistor R7 and the capacitor C5 are adjusted to the value so as to suppress the noise. The inductor L4 consists of a few turns of gauge wire wound on a ferrite bead which acts as a choke.<br>
The transmitter circuit as disclosed in figure 2 has an amplifier stage to raise the power output to 200-250 milliwatts having about 50 ohm around plane antenna or multi-element antenna.<br>
The circuit built around transistor T1 is a basic low -power variable frequency oscillator. A varicop diode circuit is included to change the frequency of the transmitter and to provide frequency modulation by auignals. The output of the oscillator is about 40-55 milliwatts. Transistor T2 forms a VHFpower amplifier, which boosts the oscillator's signal power.<br>
In the receiver circuit as shown in figure 3 , there is a tuning capacitor C1, Disc Capacitor C2, Resistor R1, Germanium Diode D1, the loopstick Antenna L1, miscellaneous 1C socket, crystal Earphone wire and Antenna.<br>
The receiver circuit receives the frequency transmitted through the transmitter as herein before described. The capacitor C1 is a tuning capacitor for obtaining the right and noiseless signals without any distortion. L1 is the Antenna of desired length consisting number of turns of particular wire. D1 is the diode which is in forward bias when the current flows through it to the operational amplifier. C2 is a disc operator in microfarads. To the inverting terminal of the Op-Amp is connected to the capacitor C2 and the non-inverting terminal is connected to the ground voltage level. The voltage supply is through the terminal 4 and the voltage supplied is around 8-10 volts. The Resistor R1 is connected from the output terminal 6 to the input terminal 2,<br><br>
so that it acts as a feedback circuit element and adjust voltage levels. The terminal 3 and terminal 6 are the output terminals which are connected to the input of an audio amplifier system to receive good alarm signal.<br>
In the amplifier circuit , the capacitor C1 which is a microfarad electrolyte which also acts as a filter for the circuit whose one end is connected to the output terminal of the receiver plate and negative end is connected to the IC1 which is an integrated circuit amplifier. The voltage is supplied to the terminal 5 of the IC1 and the noninverting terminal. The negative end of the capacitor is connected to the Resistor r1 and r2 . The output terminal of IC1 is connected to one end of the Resistor R2. The disc operator C3 is connected to the power supply and the other end to the ground voltage level so that any descrete component of current or voltage may be eliminated. The capacitor C4 has its positive terminal connected to the Resistor R2 and the negative terminal to the speaker for getting the desired signal.<br>
The subject invention is for illustrative purposes and various improvements and modifications are possible , which should be construed to be within the scope of the invention. The description disclosed herewith should not in any manner restrict the broad scope of the instant invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
