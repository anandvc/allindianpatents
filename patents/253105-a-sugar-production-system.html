				<td>SUGAR PRODUCTION SYSTEM<br>
This International Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent Application claims the benefit<br>
of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/457,516, filed March 24, 2003,<br>
hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
I. TECHNICAL FIELD.<br>
Generally, a system for the production of sugar from sucrose containing liquids<br>
obtained from plant material. Specifically, a sugar process liquid conditioner that alters<br>
sugar process liquid characteristics, and sugar process steps which utilize sugar process<br>
liquid having altered sugar process liquid characteristics, to produce sugar.<br>
H. BACKGROUND<br>
Sucrose, C12H22O11, a disaccharide, is a condensation molecule that links one<br>
glucose monosaccharide and one fructose monosaccharide. Sucrose occurs naturally in<br>
many fruits and vegetables of the plant kingdom, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, sweet<br>
sorghum, sugar palms, or sugar maples. The amount of sucrose produced by plants can be<br>
dependent on the genetic strain, soil or fertilization factors, weather conditions during<br>
growth, incidence of plant disease, degree of maturity, or the treatment between<br>
harvesting and processing, among many factors.<br>
Sucrose may be concentrated in certain portions of the plant such as the sugar beet<br>
root or the stalks of the sugarcane plant. The entire plant, or a portion of the plant, in<br>
which the sucrose is concentrated can be harvested and the plant material processed to<br>
obtain a sugar process liquid containing an amount of sucrose. See for example, "Sugar<br>
Technology, Beet and Cane Sugar Manufacture" by P. W. van der Poel et al. (1998);<br>
"Beet-Sugar Technology" edited by R.A. McGinnis, Third Edition (1982); or "Cane<br>
Sugar Handbook: A Manual for Cane Sugar Manufacturers and Their Chemists" by<br>
James C. P. Chen, Chung Chi Chou, 12th Edition (1993); and United States Patent Nos.<br>
6,051,075; 5,928,42; 5,480,490, each hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
Now referring to Figure 1, as non-limiting example, sugar beets (1) can be sliced<br>
into thin strips called "cossettes" (2). The cossettes (2) can be introduced a cossette mixer<br>
(3)	through which a flow of sugar process liquid (4) passes. The cossettes (2) traverse the<br>
cossette mixer (3) counter current to the flow of the sugar process liquid (4) in the<br>
cossette mixer (3). As the cosettes (2) traverse the cossette mixer (3) a portion of the<br>
sucrose in the cossettes (2) transfers to the flow of sugar process liquid (3). The cossettes<br>
(2) and a portion of the sugar process liquid (4) can be transferred to a cossette slurry inlet<br>
(5) at the first end of a diffuser (6) while a diffusion liquid (7) enters at a diffusion liquid<br>
inlet (8) at the second end (8) of the diffuser. The cossettes (2) traverse the diffuser (7)<br>
counter current to the flow of diffusion liquid (8). Counter current diffusion of sugar beet<br>
cossettes (2) can transfer up to about ninety eight percent (98%) of the sucrose along with<br>
a variety of other materials from the cossette (2). The cossettes (2) are transferred from<br>
the diffuser (6) at the cosette slurry outlet (9) to a pulp press (10) in which liquid is<br>
squeezed from the cossettes (2). The liquid squeezed from the cossettes (2) is often<br>
referred to as "pulp press water" (11) can have a pH value of about 5 and is returned to<br>
the diffuser (6) at a pulp press water inlet (9) at the second end of the diffuser (6) to<br>
combine with the diffusion liquid (7). The flow of sugar process liquid (4) from the<br>
diffuser (6)(often referred to as "diffusion juice") returns the combined diffusion liquid<br>
(7), pulp press liquid (11), and other liquid(s) that may be introduced into the diffuser (6)<br>
to the cosette mixer (3). The flow of sugar process liquid (4) from the diffuser (6) may be<br>
split into two or more streams and other liquids may be combined into the flow of sugar<br>
process liquid (4) as it returns to the cossette mixer (3). The flow of sugar process liquid<br>
(4)	entering the cossette mixer (3) traverses the cossette mixer (3) counter current to the<br>
cosettes (2). The sugar process liquid (4) transferred from the cossette mixer (3) is often<br>
referred to as "raw juice".<br>
There are many alternative methods of transferring sucrose containing liquids<br>
from plant material. As a second non-limiting example (not shown by the figures), a<br>
diffusion process for sugarcane utilizes a moving bed of finely prepared sugarcane pieces<br>
passed through a spray of diffusion liquid to transfer sucrose (along with a variety of<br>
other materials) from the plant material into the diffusion liquid.<br>
As a third non-limiting example, a milling process for sugar cane passes sugar<br>
cane stalks through rollers to squeeze sugar cane juice from the plant material. This<br><br>
process may be repeated several times down a series of mills to ensure that substantially<br>
all the sugar cane juice is removed.<br>
Regardless of the process or method utilized to transfer sucrose from plant<br>
material, the resulting sugar process liquid (4) contains sucrose, non-sucrose substances,<br>
and water. The non-sucrose substances may include all manner of plant derived<br>
substances and non-plant derived substances, including but not limited to: insoluble<br>
material, such as, plant fiber, soil particles, metal particles, or other debris; and soluble<br>
materials, such as, fertilizer, sucrose, saccharides other than sucrose, organic and<br>
inorganic non-sugars, organic acids (such as acetic acid, L-lactic acid, or D-lactic acid),<br>
dissolved gases (such as CO2, SO2, or O2), proteins, inorganic acids, phosphates, metal<br>
ions (for example, iron, aluminum, or magnesium ions) or pectins; colored materials;<br>
saponins; waxes; fats; or gums; as to each their associated or linked moieties, or<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
Now referring to Figure 2, a gradual addition of base (13) to the sugar process<br>
liquid (4) raises pH from within a range of between about 5.5 pH to about 6.5pH up to a<br>
range of between about 11.5 pH to about 11.8pH. The rise in pH enables certain non-<br>
sucrose substances contained in the sugar process liquid (4) to reach their respective iso-<br>
electric points. This step is often referred to as "preliming" can be performed in a<br>
multiple cell prelimer (14). The term "preliming" is not meant to limit the step of adding<br>
base to sucrose containing sugar process liquids (4) solely to those process systems that<br>
refer to this addition of base as "preliming". Rather, it should be understood that in the<br>
various conventional juice process systems it may be desirable to first utilize base to raise<br>
pH or sugar process liquid (4) prior to subsequent clarification or purification steps. The<br>
subsequent clarification and purification steps can involve a filtration step, as described<br>
by United States Patent Nos. 4,432,806, 5,759,283, or the like; an ion exchange step as<br>
described in British Patent No. 1,043,102, or United States Patent Nos. 3, 618, 589,<br>
3,785,863, 4,140,541, or 4,331,483, 5,466,294, or the like; a chromatography step as<br>
described by United States Patent Nos. 5,466,294, 4,312,678, 2,985,589, 4,182,633,<br>
4,412,866, or 5,102,553, or the like; or an ultrafilitration step as described by United<br>
States Patent No. 4,432,806, or the like; phase separation as described by United States<br>
Patent No. 6,051,075, or the like; or process systems that add active materials to the final<br>
carbonation vessel as described by United States Patent No. 4,045,242, each as an<br><br>
alternative to the conventional sugar process steps of "main liming" and "carbonation",<br>
each reference hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The term "base" involves the use of any material capable of raising pH of a juice<br>
or sugar process liquids (4) including, but not limited to the use of lime or the underflow<br>
from processes that utilize lime, such as calcium carbonate sludge (13) recovered after hot<br>
liming and carbonation. The use of the term "lime" typically involves the specific use of<br>
quick lime or calcium oxides formed by heating calcium (generally in the form of<br>
limestone) in oxygen to form calcium oxide (15). Milk of lime is preferred in many juice<br>
process systems, and consists of a suspension of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in water<br>
produced in a slaker (16) in accordance with the following reaction:<br>
CaO+H2O ↔ Ca(OH)2 +15.5 Cal.<br>
The term "iso-electric point" involves the pH at which dissolved or colloidal<br>
materials, such as proteins, within the sugar process liquid (4) have zero electrical<br>
potential. When such dissolved or colloidal materials reach their designated iso-electric<br>
points, they may form a plurality of solid particles, flocculate, or flocs in the sugar<br>
process liquid (4).<br>
Flocculation may be further enhanced by the addition of calcium carbonate<br>
materials to juice, which functionally form a core or substrate with which the solid<br>
particles or flocculates associate. This process increases the size, weight or density of the<br>
particles, thereby facilitating the filtration or settling of such solid particles or materials<br>
and their removal from the juice.<br>
A conventional sugar process method further purifies the process liquids (4)<br>
including residual lime, excess calcium carbonate, solid particles, flocculant, or floc, to<br>
stabilize the floc or particles formed in the preliming step. A cold main liming step (not<br>
shown in Figure 2) may involve the addition of about another 0.3-0.7% lime by weight of<br>
prelimed sugar process liquids (4)(or more depending on the quality of the prelimed<br>
juice) undertaken at a temperature of between about 30°C to about 40°C.<br><br>
The cold main limed juice may then be hot main limed (17) to farther degrade<br>
invert sugar and other components that are not stable to this step. Hot main liming (17)<br>
may involve the further addition of lime (18) to cause the pH of the limed juice to<br>
increase to a level of between about 12 pH to about12.5 pH. This results in a portion of<br>
the soluble non-sucrose materials that were not affected by preceding addition of base or<br>
lime to decompose. In particular, hot main liming (17) of the sugar process liquid (4) may<br>
achieve thermostability by partial decomposition of invert sugar, amino acids, amides,<br>
and other dissolved non-sucrose materials.<br>
After cold or hot main liming (17), the main limed sugar process liquid (4) can be<br>
subjected to a first carbonation step (18) in which carbon dioxide gas (19) can be<br>
combined with the main limed sugar process liquid (4). The carbon dioxide gas (19)<br>
reacts with residual lime in the main limed juice to produce calcium carbonate precipitate<br>
(13) or sludge. Not only may residual lime be removed by this procedure (typically about<br>
95% by weight of the residual lime), but also the surface-active calcium carbonate<br>
precipitate (13) may trap substantial amounts of remaining dissolved non-sucrose<br>
substances. Furthermore, the calcium carbonate precipitate (13) may function as a filter<br>
aid in the physical removal of solid materials from the main limed (17) and carbonated<br>
juice (18).<br>
The clarified sugar process liquid (4) obtained from the first carbonation step (18)<br>
may then be subjected to additional liming steps, heating steps, a second carbonation step<br>
(20), filtering steps, membrane ultrafiltration steps, chromatography separation steps, or<br>
ion exchange steps as above described, or combinations, permutations, or derivations<br>
thereof, to further clarify or purify the juice obtained from the first carbonation step<br>
resulting in a sugar process liquid (4) referred to as "thin juice".<br>
Now referring to Figure 3, which provides a further non-limiting example, "thin<br>
juice" may be thickened by evaporation of a portion of the water content to yield a sugar<br>
process liquid (4) conventionally referred to as "thick juice". Evaporation of a portion of<br>
the water content may be performed in a multi-stage evaporator (21).<br>
Now referring to Figure 4, as a non-limiting example, the thickened sugar process<br>
liquid (4) or "thick juice" mixed with other sugar process liquids ("thin juice", centrifugal<br><br>
wash liquids and syrups) and remelted (22) (23) lower grade sugar crystals generated are<br>
transferred to a "white pan" (24). In the "white pan" (24), even more water is boiled off<br>
until conditions are right for sucrose or sugar crystals to grow. Because it may be<br>
difficult to get the sucrose or sugar crystals to grow well, some seed crystals of sucrose or<br>
sugar are added to initiate crystal formation. Once the crystals have grown the resulting<br>
mixture of crystals and remaining thickened sugar process liquid (4) can be separated in a<br>
"white centrifuge" (25). The thickened sugar process liquid (4) from the "white pan" is<br>
transferred to the "high raw pan" (26) for recrystallization. The "high raw sugar crystals"<br>
(27) generated in the "high raw pan" (26) are separated from the thickened sugar process<br>
liquid (4) by the "high raw centrifuge" (28) and returned to the "high melter" (22) to be<br>
combined with incoming "thick juice", while the thickened process liquid (4) from the<br>
"white pan" (24) is recrystallized in the "low raw pan" (29). The "low raw pan sugar<br>
crystals" (30) are returned to the "low raw melter" (23) to be combined with incoming<br>
"thick juice". The remaining thickened sugar process liquid (4) from the 'low raw pan"<br>
(29) which is not recrystallized is referred to as "molasses".<br>
The sugar crystals from the "white pan" (31) after separation from the thickened<br>
sugar process liquid in the "white centrifuge" can be washed ("high wash") (32) to<br>
generate the desired color. The "high wash" (32) from the "white centrifuge" contains a<br>
substantial amount of sucrose and is returned to the "high melter" (22). The separated<br>
sucrose or sugar crystals (33) are then transferred to a sugar dryer (34) to bring the sugar<br>
crystals (33) to obtain the desired moisture content.<br>
As can be understood from the above non-limiting examples numerous types of<br>
sugar process liquids and sugar process products are generated by purification of sucrose<br>
containing liquid from plant material. Solids comprising the remaining plant material;<br>
solids separated from sugar process liquid during clarification, purification or refining;<br>
sugar or sucrose containing juices; crystallized sugar or sucrose; mother liquors from<br>
crystallization of sugar or sucrose; by products of the process system; and various<br>
combinations, permutations, or derivatives thereof, each having a level of impurities<br>
consistent with the process steps utilized in their production, or consistent with<br>
conventional standards for that type, or kind of product produced, including, but not<br>
limited to: animal feeds containing exhausted plant material, such as, exhausted beet<br>
cossettes, pulp, or bagasse or other solids or juices separated from process liquids; solid<br><br>
fuel which can be burned to generate steam for electrical power production, or to generate<br>
low pressure steam that can be returned to the sugar process system, or to generate low<br>
grade heat; syrup ranging from pure sucrose solutions such as those sold to industrial<br>
users to treated syrups incorporating flavors and colors, or those incorporating some<br>
invert sugar to prevent crystallization of sucrose, for example, golden syrup; molasses<br>
obtained by removal of all or any part of the crystallizable sucrose or sugar, or products<br>
derived from molasses, one example being treacle; alcohol distilled from molasses;<br>
bianco directo or plantation sugars generated by sulfitation using sulfur dioxide (S02) as<br>
a bleaching agent; juggeri or gur generated by boiling sucrose or sugar containing juices<br>
until essentially dry, juice sugar from melting refined white sugar or from syrup(s) which<br>
may be further decolorized; single-crystallization cane sugars often referred to as<br>
"unrefined sugar" in the United Kingdom or other parts of Europe, or referred to as<br>
"evaporated cane juice" in the North American natural foods industry to describe a free-<br>
flowing, single-crystallization cane sugar that is produced with a minimal degree of<br>
processing; milled cane; demerara; muscovado; rapedura; panela; turbina; raw sugar<br>
which can be about 94-98 percent sucrose, the balance being molasses, ash, and other<br>
trace elements; refined sugars such as extra fine granulated having a quality based upon<br>
"bottlers" quality specified by the National Soft Drink Association being water white and<br>
at least 99.9 percent sucrose; specialty white sugars, such as, caster sugar, icing sugar,<br>
sugar cubes, or preserving sugar; brown sugars that can be manufactured by spraying and<br>
blending white refined sugar with molasses which can be light or dark brown sugar<br>
depending on the characteristics of the molasses; or powdered sugar made in various<br>
degrees of fineness by pulverizing granulated sugar in a powder mill and which may<br>
further contain corn starch or other chemicals to prevent caking.<br>
This list is not meant to be limiting with respect to the products generated from<br>
the sucrose containing liquids obtained from plant material or subsequently generated<br>
sugar process liquids during purification, but rather, is meant to be illustrative of the<br>
numerous and varied products that can be generated by conventional sugar process<br>
systems, including, but not limited to, the sugar process systems described above, and<br>
other sugar process systems not specifically described but understood inherently from the<br>
above description based upon the type of plant material processed or the final product<br>
obtained. Sugar process systems encompass numerous permutations and combinations of<br>
individual components or process steps which can result in the same or similar or<br><br>
different sugar process products and by products. It is to be understood that the invention<br>
can be useful in each type or kind of sugar process system whether expressly or<br>
inherently described herein.<br>
There is a competitive global commercial market for the products derived from<br>
sugar process systems. Because the market for sugar and by products of sugar process<br>
systems are vast, even a slight reduction in the cost of sugar or a by product can yield a<br>
substantial and desired monetary savings. While this strong commercial incentive has<br>
been coupled to a long history of sugar production of at least 1000 years, and specifically<br>
with regard to production of sugar from sugar beets for which commercial process<br>
systems have been established 100 years, there remain significant unresolved problems<br>
related to the production of sugar.<br>
A significant problem related to the production of sugar can be the amount of<br>
organic acids and inorganic acids in sugar process liquids. When plant cell juice (3)<br>
contains sufficient cations, hydroxide ion (OH-) can act as a anion, which enables carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2) to dissolve into the juice (3) as carbonate ions (CO3)-2, or as bicarbonate<br>
ions HCO3-. The dissociation of HCO3- provides a very weak acid. However, when juice<br>
(3) contains an insufficient number of cations to allow dissolved CO2 to form carbonate<br>
or bicarbonate ions, an equilibrium results between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid<br>
H2CO3. Carbonic acid can act as a strong acid in the pH range at which sugar process<br>
liquid (4) are processed.<br>
Similarly, sulfur dioxide (SO2) or ammonium bisulfite (NH4HSO3) may be<br>
introduced into the sugar process liquid (4) to control, reduce, or eliminate microbiologic<br>
activity, sucrose hydrolysis, formation of invert sugars, or loss of sucrose, or to adjust pH<br>
lower. Again, when sugar process liquid (4) contains sufficient cations, such as calcium,<br>
sulphites, such as calcium sulfite can result. However, when juice contains an insufficient<br>
number of cations to allow dissolved sulfur dioxide (SO2) to form sulphites, an<br>
equilibrium results between sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfurous acid (H2SO3), and sulfuric<br>
acid (H2SO4). Sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid can also act as strong acids.<br>
Additionally, other inorganic and organic acids can be generated by the plant<br>
during normal growth and other acids are generated by microbial activity including, but<br><br>
not limited to: acetic acid; carbonic acid; propanonic acid; butanoic acid; pentanoic acid;<br>
phosphoric acid; hydrochloric acid; sulfuric acid; sulfurous acid; citric acid; oxalic acid;<br>
succinic acid; fumaric acid; glycolic acid; pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid; formic acid;<br>
butyric acid; maleic acid; 3-methylbutanoic; 5-methylhexanoic; hexanoic acid; or a<br>
heptanoic acid, individually or in various combinations and concentrations<br>
Inorganic acids and organic acids contained within the sugar process liquids (4)<br>
lower pH of the sugar process liquids and must be neutralized with base. The higher the<br>
concentration of organic acids or inorganic acids within the sugar process liquids (4), the<br>
greater the amount of base that may be necessary to raise the pH of the juice to a desired<br>
value in the prelimer (14) or other step prior to subsequent purification steps.<br>
As discussed above, calcium oxide (15) or calcium hydroxide may be added to<br>
sugar process liquid (4) to raise the pH allowing certain dissolved materials to come out<br>
of solution as solids, flocculent, or flocs. Calcium oxide is typically obtained through<br>
calcination of limestone a process in which the limestone is heated in a kiln in the<br>
presence of oxygen until carbon dioxide is released resulting in calcium oxide.<br>
Calcination can be expensive because it requires the purchase of a kiln, limestone, and<br>
fuel, such as gas, oil, coal, coke, or the like, which is combusted to raise the temperature<br>
of the kiln sufficiently to release carbon dioxide from the limestone: Ancillary equipment<br>
to transport the limestone and the fuel to the kiln and to remove the resulting calcium<br>
oxide from the kiln must also be provided along with equipment to scrub certain kiln<br>
gases and particles from the kiln air exhausted during calcination of the limestone.<br>
Additionally, calcium oxide generated by calcination must be converted to<br>
calcium hydroxide for use in conventional sugar process systems. Again this involves the<br>
purchase of equipment to reduce the calcium oxide to suitably sized particles and to mix<br>
these particles with water to generate calcium hydroxide.<br>
Another problem related to the use of base in conventional process systems can be<br>
disposal of precipitates, flocs, and calcium carbonate formed in liming and carbonation<br>
steps When the sugar process system uses one or more carbonation steps (18)(20) in<br>
clarifying or purifying juice, the amount of calcium carbonate or other salts formed, often<br>
referred to as "sludge", "spent lime", or "carbonation lime" (13), will be proportionate to<br><br>
the amount of lime (15) added to sugar process liquids (4). Simply put, the greater the<br>
amount of lime (15) added to the sugar process liquids (4), the greater the amount of<br>
"spent lime" (13) formed during the carbonation steps. The "spent lime" (13) may be<br>
allowed to settle to the bottom of the carbonation vessel (18)(20) forming what is<br>
sometimes referred to as a "lime mud". The "lime mud" or "spent lime" (13) can be<br>
separated by a rotary vacuum filter (34) or plate and frame press. The product formed is<br>
then called "lime cake"(35). The lime cake (35) or lime mud may largely be calcium<br>
carbonate precipitate but may also contain sugars, other organic or inorganic matter, or<br>
water. These separated precipitates are almost always handled separately from other<br>
process system wastes and may, for example, be slurried with water and pumped to<br>
settling ponds or areas surrounded by levees or transported to land fills.<br>
Alternately, the carbonation lime, lime mud, or lime cake, can be recalcined.<br>
However, the cost of a recalcining kiln and the peripheral equipment to recalcine spent<br>
lime (13) can be substantially more expensive than a kiln for calcining limestone.<br>
Furthermore, the quality of recalcined "carbonation lime" can be different than calcined<br>
limestone. The purity of calcined limestone compared to recalcined carbonation lime<br>
may be, as but one example, 92% compared with 77%. As such, the amount of recalcined<br>
lime required to neutralize the same amount of hydronium ion in juice may be<br>
correspondingly higher. Also, the carbon dioxide content of spent lime can be much<br>
higher than limestone. As such, not only can recalcined lime be expensive to generate, it<br>
can also require the use of substantially larger gas conduit and equipment to transfer the<br>
generated CO2 from recalcining spent lime, larger conveying equipment to move the<br>
recalcined lime, larger carbonation tanks, or the like. Whether spent lime (13)(35) is<br>
disposed of in ponds, landfills, or by recycling, the greater the amount of lime (15)<br>
utilized in a particular process system, generally the greater the expense of disposing the<br>
spent lime.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar process systems may be an<br>
incremental decrease in sugar process system throughput corresponding with an<br>
incremental increase in the amount of lime (15) used in processing sugar process liquid<br>
(4). One aspect of this problem may be that there is a limit to the amount of or rate at<br>
which lime (15) can be produced or provided to sugar process steps. As discussed above,<br>
lime stone must be calcined to produce calcium oxide (15) prior to its use as a base in<br><br>
sugar process systems. The amount of lime (15) produced may be limited in by<br>
availability of limestone, kiln capacity, fuel availability, or the like. The rate at which<br>
lime (15) can be made available to the sugar process system may vary based on the size,<br>
kind, or amount of the lime generation equipment, available labor, or the like. Another<br>
aspect of this problem can be that the amount of lime (15) used in the sugar process<br>
system may proportionately reduce volume available for sugar process liquid (4) in the<br>
sugar process system. Increased use of base, such as lime (15), may also require the use<br>
of larger containment areas, conduits, or the like to maintain throughput of the same<br>
volume of juice.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar process systems, can be<br>
limesalts in sugar process liquid (4) which are not precipitated during the steps of<br>
preliming (123), mainliming (17), and carbonation (18)(19), but none-the-less, must be<br>
removed from sugar process liquid (4) prior to evaporation of water from 'thin juice" to<br>
prevent or reduce scale formation in the evaporator. For example, oxalate the calcium<br>
salt of oxalic acid often forms the main component of scale remains in sugar process<br>
liquids (4) after carbonation. However, "thin" or "thick" sugar process liquids can contain<br>
sufficient calcium to force oxalate out of solution as water is evaporated. The process of<br>
removing scale from the surfaces of equipment can be expensive, including, but not<br>
limited to, costs due to production slowdowns and efficiency losses, or the reduction in<br>
the effective life of equipment<br>
To remove limesalts prior to evaporation steps (21) to affect a reduction of scale<br>
deposition in the evaporators (21), sugar process liquids (4) can be passed through an<br>
anion exchanger (34) which binds calcium ion to anion exchange resin in exchange for<br>
the release of two sodium ions which are transferred to the sugar process liquids (4)<br>
(certain conventional process systems do not remove limesalts prior to evaporation). The<br>
calcium ion bound to the anion exchange resin is released by periodic washing of the<br>
column with a regenerate (35) such as sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid solution<br>
depending on the type of exchange resin. The spent regenerant (35) primarily made up of<br>
calcium ion and hydroxide ion in solution(when sodium hydroxide in solution is utilized<br>
as a regenerate) has a high pH and can be recycled prelimer (14) to supplement to the<br>
milk of lime (18). This can be a benefit by reducing the amount of milk of lime (18)<br>
needed to increase pH of the sugar process liquid (4) in the prelimer (14) to achieve a pH<br><br>
in the range of 11.5 to 11.8. However, when limesalts increase the amount of spent<br>
regenerant (35) produced also increases and can cause problems in balancing the prelimer<br>
(14) to operate consistently. Shifts in alkalinity and pH in the prelimer (14) can result in<br>
poor removal of non-sucrose materials and higher limesalts which in turn requires more<br>
frequent regeneration of the anion exchanger. All of which add cost to the production of<br>
sugar.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar process systems can be the<br>
amount of other organic compounds in the sugar process liquid (4). These organic<br>
compounds can without limitation include: acetaldehydes; ethanol; acetone;<br>
dimethylsulfide; 2-propenenitrile; methyl acetate; isopropanal; 2-methyl propanal;<br>
methacrolein; 2-methyl-2-propanol; propanenitrile; 1-propanol; 2-butanone; 2,3-<br>
butanediom ethyl acetate; 2 butanol; methyl propanoate; 2- butanal; 3-methylbutanal; 3-<br>
methyl-2-butanone; isopropal acetate; 2-methyl butanal; 1-butanol, 2-butenenitrile; 2-<br>
pentanone; 2,3-pentanedione; ethyl propanoate; propyl acetate; 3-methyl butanentrile;<br>
methyl isobutyl ketone; 2-methyl-2-butenal; 3 methyl-1-butanol; isopropyl propanoate;<br>
isobutyl acetate; 2-methyl-3-pentanol; 2,3-hexanedione; 2-hexanone; ethyl butanoate;<br>
butyl acetate; 4-methyl pentanenitrile; 2-hexenal; 3-methyl-1-butanol acetate; 3-<br>
heptanone; 2-heptanone; 5-hepten-2-one; heptanal; 3-octene-2-one; 2-heptenal; 3-<br>
octanone; butyl butanoate; 2-methoxy-3-isopropyl pyrazine; 2-methoxy-3-(1-<br>
methylpropyl)pyrazine; alcohols; aldehydes; ketones; volatile acids; carbon monoxide;<br>
carbon dioxide; sulfur dioxide; esters; nitriles; sulfide; pyrazine;.<br>
Certain organic compounds can be highly colored or are the precursors to colored<br>
compounds which can be generated as pH'and temperature of the sugar process liquids<br>
(4) are elevated during preliming (14) and hot main liming (17). A sugar process system<br>
as above-described processing about 8,500 tons per day of sliced sugar beets, with thin<br>
juice color at about 4,000 reference base units (RBU) produces a final white sugar color<br>
of about 43 RBU. To achieve a "standard" white sugar color of at least 40 RBU the<br>
"white centrifugal wash" (32) must be adjusted to bring the color of the "white pan" sugar<br>
crystals (33) from 43 RBU to 40 RBU. Adjustment of the centrifugal wash (32) to reduce<br>
color also reduces the amount of sugar (33) produced by about 0.65 tons/hour.<br><br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be<br>
low purity of sugar, process liquids (4) expressed as a percent ratio of sugar to total dry<br>
solids of sugar process liquid (4). Typically, the higher the concentration of total dry<br>
solids in sugar process liquid (4), including any of the above-described materials or other<br>
materials, relative to the amount of sucrose in the sugar process liquid (4), the less<br>
desirable the sugar process liquid (4). Understandably, any decrease in the total dry<br>
solids relative to sucrose in the sugar process liquid (4) yields a comparatively better juice<br>
for subsequent purification.<br>
Soluble non-sucrose materials in sugar process liquid (4) can interfere with<br>
subsequent processing or purification steps or adversely impact the quality or quantity of<br>
the resulting sugar or other products produced. It has been estimated that on average each<br>
pound of soluble non-sucrose substances reduces the quantity of sugar produced by one<br>
and one-half pounds. As such, it may be desirable to have all or a portion of these soluble<br>
non-sucrose substances separated from or removed from the sugar process liquids (4).<br>
For example, in the sugar process system above described, a thin juice color of about<br>
2,500 RBU with a "thin juice" purity of about 92.00 can produce about 57 tons of white<br>
sugar per hour at 30 RBU. If "thin juice" purity can be increased to about 92.40 white<br>
sugar yield can be increased by 0.54 tons per hour.<br>
The present invention provides a sugar process system involving both apparatuses<br>
and methods that address each of the above-mentioned problems.<br>

V. MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
As can be understood from the description of the methods and apparatus relating<br>
to the invention below, the invention provides a sugar process system which conditions<br>
sugar process liquid to alter various sugar process liquid characteristics which affect the<br>
quality and the quantity of sugar produced.<br>
Referring now primarily to Figure 5, a non-limiting embodiment of the invention<br>
which can be utilized for the production of sugar from sugar beets (other sugar process<br>
liquids obtained from other types of plant material), can include an aeration chamber (36)<br>
which receives sugar process liquids (4) from the cossette mixer (3). A sugar process<br>
liquid transfer means (40), such as a pump or gravity, allows transfer of sugar process<br>
liquids (4) from the cossette mixer (3) to the aeration chamber (36) at a desired volume<br>
and pressure (step 1020). The aeration chamber (36) can be configured to provide a<br>
containment zone (37) having a boundary limited by the interior configuration of the<br>
aeration chamber (36). An amount of sugar process liquid (4) can be passed through the<br>
containment zone (37) coincident to passing an amount of at least one gas (38) through<br>
the containment zone (37)(step 1130). By passing an amount of at least one gas (38)(a<br>
mixture of gases or desired partial pressure of gases) through the containment zone (37)<br>
coincident with an amount of sugar process liquid (4), materials transferable from the<br>
sugar process liquid (4) move toward equilibrium with the amount of gas (38) (step<br>
1140). The amount of gas (38) passing through the containment zone can be separated<br>
from the amount of sugar process liquids (4) passing through the containment zone (37)<br>
(step 1150) and can be transferred from the aeration chamber (38) (step 1080).<br><br>
Transferable non-sucrose materials are distributed between the amount of gas (38)<br>
and the sugar process liquid (4)(step 1030). As such, a portion of transferable non-sucrose<br>
materials transferred will be transferred to the amount of gas (38) and transferred from the<br>
aeration chamber (36)(step 1080) while a certain portion of the non-sucrose materials will<br>
remain in the sugar process liquid (4) as shown by step (1040) and step (1050). The<br>
process of transferring a portion of the non-sucrose materials from the sugar process<br>
liquid (4) results in an amount of heat lost from the sugar process liquid (4)(step 1160).<br>
The term "sugar process liquid" should be understood to broadly encompass any<br>
sucrose containing liquid regardless of the manner obtained or the proportion of sucrose<br>
to non-sucrose substances or water which can occur in various proportions depending<br>
upon the quality or kind of plant material, the materials associated with the plant material,<br>
or the methods or steps used to process the plant material. As such, the term "sugar<br>
process liquid" may be used as a generic term to identify sucrose containing liquids<br>
obtained from a variety of plant materials by milling or pressing steps; sucrose containing<br>
liquids obtained from a variety of plant materials by diffusing the plant material with<br>
another liquid; sucrose containing liquids obtained or resulting from various sugar<br>
production process steps for the clarification or purification of liquids obtained by milling<br>
or diffusion; or sucrose containing liquids specifically defined by terms of art utilized in<br>
the sugar production industry such as "raw juice", "diffusion juice", "diffusion liquids",<br>
"limed juice", 'Thin juice", "thick juice", "carbonation juice", or the like.<br>
The term "gas" broadly encompasses without limitation a purified gas, such as<br>
oxygen, nitrogen, helium, ozone, carbon dioxide, neon, krypton; or a mixture of gases<br>
such as air, atmospheric gases, atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of<br>
ozone greater than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of oxygen<br>
greater than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of nitrogen greater than<br>
atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of hydrogen peroxide greater than<br>
atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of carbon dioxide greater than<br>
atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of argon greater than atmosphere, a<br>
mixture of gases containing an amount of helium greater than atmosphere, a mixture of<br>
gases containing an amount of krypton greater than atmosphere, a mixture of gases<br>
containing an amount of ozone less than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an<br>
amount of oxygen less than contained in atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an<br><br>
amount of nitrogen less than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of<br>
hydrogen peroxide less than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of<br>
carbon dioxide less than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of argon<br>
less than atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of helium less than<br>
atmosphere, a mixture of gases containing an amount of krypton less than atmosphere, or<br>
the like; or a gas or mixture of gases that have been passed through one or more filters to<br>
reduce, or to substantially eliminate, non-biological particulate or biological particles<br>
(such as bacteria, viruses, pollen, microscopic flora or fauna, or other pathogens); a gas or<br>
a mixture of gases that have been passed through chemical scrubbers or otherwise<br>
processed to generate a desired concentration or range of concentrations of partial<br>
pressures of gases; or combinations or permutations thereof.<br>
Gas filter(s) (not shown) responsive to a flow of gas can comprise a Hepa filter, or<br>
a Ulpa filter, or other type of macro-particulate or micro-particulate filter. For example,<br>
an unfiltered gas or mixture of gases can be drawn into a first stage prefilter, then through<br>
a second stage pre-filter, if desired, and then through a gas flow generator (7). The<br>
prefiltered mixture of gases can then flow through a gas filter (Hepa filter, or Ulpa filter,<br>
or other type of filter). The resulting filtered gas or filtered mixture of gases can be up to<br>
99.99% free of particles as small as about 0.3 microns when a Hepa filter is used, and up<br>
to 99.99% free of particles as small as about 0.12 microns when a Ulpa filter is used.<br>
Again referring primarily to Figure 5, the amount of gas delivered to the flow of<br>
sugar process liquid (4) (step 1130) can be transferred through a gas inlet (39) which<br>
terminates in a single or a plurality of aperture elements (not shown in Figure 5). A gas<br>
flow generator (40) can be adjusted to generate sufficient gas pressure to deliver the<br>
desired amount of at least one gas (38) into the flow of sugar process liquid (4) which<br>
passes through the containment zone (37).<br>
The flow of sugar process liquid (4) which passes through the containment zone<br>
can be a continuous flow of sugar process liquid, or responsive to a sugar process liquid<br>
flow adjustment means, such as a valve, variable flow restrictor, or regulator (mechanical<br>
or electronic) coupled to the sugar process liquid transfer means (40) whereby a<br>
continuous, intermittent, or pulsed flow of sugar process liquid (4) can established to<br><br>
increase or decrease the duration of time the flow of sugar process liquid (4) remains in<br>
the containment zone (37).<br>
As to certain embodiments of the aeration chamber, a sugar process liquid<br>
distribution element (41) can divide the flow of sugar process liquid (4) to create a<br>
plurality of streams which pass through the containment zone (37). As to certain sugar<br>
process liquid distribution elements (41) (as a non-limiting example, nozzles<br>
manufactured by BEX Incorporated, 37709 Schoolcraft Road, Livonia, Michigan) the<br>
plurality of streams of sugar process liquid (4) can be directed to converge which further<br>
disperses the streams in the containment zone (37). The flow of sugar process liquid (4)<br>
can be further divided to generate a plurality of droplets which pass through the<br>
containment zone (37). Understandably, the smaller the droplets (whether individually or<br>
on average) generated by the juice distribution element (41) the greater the cumulative<br>
surface area of the sugar process liquid (4) presented to the amount of at least one gas<br>
(38) delivered into the containment zone (37). Understandably, the amount of gas (38),<br>
the amount of sugar process liquid (4), the dispersion pattern of the sugar process liquid<br>
(4), the amount of cumulative surface area, and heat loss (step 1160) can be adjusted to<br>
establish the rate at which transferable non-sucrose materials move toward equilibrium<br>
with the amount of gas (38) (step 1140). The sugar process liquid (4) received at the<br>
outlet of the aeration chamber (step 1050) can have various sugar process liquid<br>
characteristics altered to obtain certain desired affects in subsequent processing steps as<br>
described below.<br>
Again referring primarily to Figure 6, a non-limiting embodiment of the invention<br>
which can be utilized for the production of sugar from sugar beets, can include a vacuum<br>
chamber (42) independent of or in combination with the aeration chamber (36) to<br>
condition sugar process liquids (4). Sugar process liquid (4) introduced into the vacuum<br>
chamber (42) can pass through a reduced pressure zone (43) generated by reducing partial<br>
pressures of gases in the vacuum chamber (step 1090) with a pressure reduction means<br>
(44). The reduction in partial pressures of gases in the vacuum chamber (42) can increase<br>
the vapor pressure of non-sucrose materials (certain of which are above-described as<br>
organic and inorganic materials)(step 1170). By increasing the vapor pressure of<br>
transferable non-sucrose materials an amount of non-sucrose material can be separated<br>
from the sugar process liquids (4)(step 1080) and transferred from the vacuum chamber<br><br>
(step 1110). A portion of the non-sucrose material returns to the sugar process liquid<br>
(step 1070) and the conditioned sugar process liquid is transferred from the vacuum<br>
chamber (step 1100). The sugar process liquid received at the outlet of the vacuum<br>
chamber (step 1100) can have various sugar process liquid characteristics altered to<br>
obtain certain desired affects in subsequent processing steps as described below.<br>
In similar fashion to that described for the aeration chamber (36), the flow of<br>
sugar process liquid in the vacuum chamber (42) can be dispersed or further divided to<br>
increase the surface area of the sugar process liquid (4) on which the reduced partial<br>
pressures of gases within the evacuation zone (43) can act. The vacuum chamber (42)<br>
whether a single chamber or multiple vacuum chambers in serial or parallel can be used<br>
independent of the aeration chamber, or used with the aeration chamber or multiple<br>
aeration chambers whether in serial or in parallel to condition a sugar process liquid.<br>
A first characteristic of the sugar process liquid (4) that can be altered by<br>
conditioning sugar process liquids (4) through the various embodiments of the aeration<br>
chamber (36), or the vacuum chamber (42), or both in various combinations or<br>
permutations, can be pH. The pH of the sugar process liquid (4) can be increased by<br>
about 0.01 pH units, about 0.05 pH units, about 0.1 pH units, about 0.2 pH units, about<br>
0.3 pH units, about 0.4 pH units, about 0.5 pH units, about 0.6 pH units, about 0.7 pH<br>
units, about 0.8 pH units, about 0.9 pH units, about 1.0 pH units, about 1.1 pH units,<br>
about 1.2 pH units, about 1.3 pH units, about 1.4 pH units, about 1.5 pH units, about 1.6<br>
pH units, about 1.7 pH units, about 1.8 pH units, about 1.9 pH units, or about 2.0 pH<br>
units.<br>
The increase in pH of the sugar process liquids prior to preliming (13) can affect<br>
the demand of the sugar process liquid (4) for base, such as lime (15), to achieve a<br>
necessary or desired pH, concentration of hydronium ion, or acidity as compared to<br>
unconditioned sugar process liquid (4) or conventionally processed sugar process liquid<br>
(4). The amount of lime added after conditioning of the sugar process liquid (4) in<br>
accordance with the invention can be substantially less to establish a desired pH value,<br>
such as, between about 11.0 to about 12.0, or between 11.5 to about 12.5, or the range of<br>
pH used to "prelime", "main lime", "intermediate lime, or to establish a pH value<br>
corresponding to the iso-electric point of any particular non-sucrose material in the sugar<br><br>
process liquid (4), or required to adjust the acidity or alkalinity of the juice to a desired<br>
concentration. As a non-limiting example, sugar process liquid (4) conditioned as above-<br>
described, can exhibit a reduced lime demand of up to 30%. Now referring primarily to<br>
Figure 2, if a 30% reduction in lime demand can be achieved a savings of $708.00 per<br>
day ($141,163.00 over a 200 day campaign) could be achieved.<br>
A second characteristic of the sugar process liquid (4) that can be altered by<br>
conditioning sugar process liquids (4) through the various embodiments of the aeration<br>
chamber (37), or the vacuum chamber (43), or both in various combinations or<br>
permutations, can be color. Importantly, even a minor reduction in "thin juice" color can<br>
substantially increase the amount of white sugar (33) produced from a ton of sugar beets<br>
or sugar cane, or per unit of process liquid (4).<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, materials which generate color in sugar<br>
process liquids (4) or in sugar (33) can be transferred from the flow of sugar process<br>
liquid (4) as it passes through the aeration chamber (36) or the vacuum chamber (42)<br>
(steps 1150, 1040, 1060, and 1070). The removal of these color generation materials<br>
correspondingly reduces the amount of color generated in the conditioned sugar process<br>
liquid (4), introduces a conditioned sugar process liquid (3) with less color in subsequent<br>
sugar process steps, and can result in less color in sugar crystals (33)(27)(30). In this<br>
regard and referring now to Example 4, Table 4, as a non-limiting example, color<br>
generation materials such as 2,3 butanedione and 2-butanone can be removed from the<br>
flow of sugar process liquid (4) as it passes through the containment zone (37) of the<br>
aeration chamber (36). These materials are known to generate color in juice and removal<br>
can reduce juice color and sugar (33) color.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the molecular structure of certain materials<br>
contained in the sugar process liquids (4) can be oxidized by conditioning the sugar<br>
process liquid (4) in accordance with the invention. The corresponding oxidized forms of<br>
certain materials may generate less color or generate no color in sugar process liquid (4)<br>
or in the resulting sugar (33). As a non-limiting example, primary alcohols can be<br>
converted to the corresponding aldehydes or carboxylic acids.<br><br>
With respect to certain embodiments of the invention the amount of gas (38) or<br>
partial pressures of gases can be adjusted to include or increase the amount of an oxidant<br>
in the gas (38) delivered to the containment zone (37) of the aeration chamber (36)<br>
including, but not limited to, oxygen, ozone, peroxide, air stripped of certain partial<br>
pressures of gases, or an amount of oxidant capable of converting primary alcohols to<br>
corresponding aldehydes or carboxylic acids. A separate oxidant flow generator (45) can<br>
be used to disperse oxidant(s) into the flow of sugar process liquid (4) which passes<br>
through the containment zone (37).<br>
Now referring to Figures 2 and 6, a "conventional sugar process system can be<br>
compared with a sugar process system in accordance with the invention. A conventional<br>
sugar process system processing about 335 tons of sugar beet cossettes (2) per hour (see<br>
Figure 1) can have a "thin juice" color after the second carbonation (20) of about 3,414<br>
RBU (see Figure 2). A sugar process system which further includes an aeration chamber<br>
(37) and a vacuum chamber (42) in accordance with the invention processing the same<br>
tonnage of sugar beet cosettes can produce a "thin juice" after the second carbonation<br>
(20) of about 2,911 RBU (see Figure 6). Under these conditions the conventional sugar<br>
process system achieves a final white sugar color of 37 RBU (see Figure 4) while the<br>
sugar process system in accordance with the invention achieves a final white sugar color<br>
of 34 RBU. In the conventional sugar process system as described above, "thin juice"<br>
having color greater than 3,000 RBU can result in a loss of up to $12,000.00 per day in<br>
sugar loss, sugar recovery and energy with every 500-1000 RBU increase in sugar<br>
process liquid color.<br>
As a further example, a conventional sugar process system operating at about<br>
8,500 tons per day of sliced sugar beets, with thin juice color at about 4,000 RBU<br>
produces a final white sugar color of about 43 RBU. To achieve a "standard" white sugar<br>
color of 40 RBU the centrifugal wash procedure must be adjusted to reduce the recycle of<br>
sugar at the sugar end. This results in more sugar to washed out and ultimately into<br>
molasses reducing sugar yield by about 0.65 tons/hour.<br>
Additionally, a centrifugal wash (32) or a longer centrifugal wash of sugar crystals<br>
(33) in the "white centrifuge" (25) results in less sugar end capacity and reduces<br><br>
throughput of sugar process liquid (4). Moreover, a reduction in color of sugar process<br>
liquids can result in lower color molasses for desugarization with increased extract yield.<br>
A third characteristic of the sugar process liquid (4) that can be altered by<br>
conditioning sugar process liquid (4) with the aeration chamber (36), or the vacuum<br>
chamber (42), or both, in various permutations or combinations, can be concentration of<br>
limesalts. Because conditioning of sugar process liquid (4) in accordance with the<br>
invention removes certain anions, "raw juice" forms few limesalts to be carried forward<br>
into carbonation steps (18)(19). As described above, limesalts may not precipitate during<br>
the steps of preliming (14), mainliming (17), or carbonation (18)(19) because the<br>
solubility of such salts in sugar process liquid (4).<br>
When limesalts are not removed prior to the evaporators (21), precipitates of<br>
limesalts can form on the surface of evaporators (21) as water is removed from sugar<br>
process liquid (4). Boiling out evaporators (21) to remove scale can be costly because of<br>
the labor and equipment involved to perform the procedure. The removal of scale from<br>
evaporators and associated equipment can also result in additional days to the sugar<br>
process campaign.<br>
Limesalts or sodium salts when limesalts are exchanged carry sucrose to molasses.<br>
For example, when limesalts are removed from sugar process liquid (4) by ion exchange<br>
and replaced with the corresponding sodium salts during regenration (sodium salts<br>
recycled into liming steps as described above) each pound of sodium salt can carry<br>
between about 0.9 pound and about 1.5 pounds of sucrose to molasses. If limesalts are<br>
reduced by 25 parts per million, additional sugar (33) produced per day (about 0.56 tons<br>
at a 8,000 ton slice rate per day of sugar beets) has a value of about S246.40 at $22.00 per<br>
hundred weight. At 200 parts per million in the same process system a savings of about<br>
$2000.00 can be achieved per day.<br>
Additionally, as the part million limesalts are reduced there is a corresponding<br>
reduction in caustic used to regenerate the ion exchange resin. For sugar process liquid<br>
(4) generated from a beet slice rate of 8,000 ton per day with a 25 ppm reduction in<br>
limesalts achieved in accordance with the invention the corresponding reduction in<br><br>
caustic saves about $142.00. If a reduction in limesalts of 200 ppm can be achieved in<br>
the same system about $2,000.00 can be saved.<br>
Moreover, the more frequent regeneration of the anion exchange resin further<br>
slows the sugar end of conventional sugar process systems.<br>
A fourth characteristic of the sugar process liquid (4) that can be altered by<br>
conditioning sugar process liquid (4) with the aeration chamber (36), or the vacuum<br>
chamber (42), or both, in various permutations or combinations, can be purity. Purity as a<br>
percent relates the amount of sucrose in sugar process liquids to the amount of soluble<br>
non-sucrose materials in sugar process liquid.<br>
As discussed above, there can be a significant reduction in the amount of volatile<br>
inorganic materials and organic materials when "raw juice" is conditioned in accordance<br>
with the invention. The reduction in these non-sucrose materials by transferring them to<br>
atmosphere (steps 1080 and 1100) can increase purity of sugar process liquids (4) from<br>
the cossette mixer in the range of about 0.2% and about 0.4% and can increase purity of<br>
thin juice in the range of between about 0.15% and about 0.35%. This increase in purity<br>
corresponds to an increase in sugar (33) production of between about 1 pound and 3<br>
pounds per ton of sugar beets sliced. For a sugar process system in accordance with the<br>
invention having a slice rate of 8000 pounds per day a savings of between about<br>
$1,500.00 and about $5,000.00 a day can be achieved.<br>
Additionally, the same purity of thin juice can be achieved at greater throughput in<br>
a sugar process system in accordance with the invention. Colloidal particles, or other<br>
particles, in sugar process liquid (4) can be contaminated by electrostatic adsorption of<br>
ions to the surface. This primary adsorption layer can give rise to a substantial surface<br>
charge (electric potential at the surface). This surface charge can cause a repulsion to<br>
exist between two particles when they approach each other and can also attract counter<br>
ions into the vicinity of the particle.<br>
Thus, the colloidal or other particles can have a charged surface with an associated<br>
"ion cloud" which extends into the sugar process liquid (4) some distance away from<br>
particles to balance the surface charge. The thickness of this ion cloud around the particle<br><br>
determines how close two particles can get to each other before they start experiencing<br>
repulsive forces. The size of this "ion cloud" depends on the magnitude of the surface<br>
charge which depends on the solution concentration of the adsorbing ion, and the<br>
concentration of electrolyte in solution.<br>
The volume defined by the entire ion cloud surrounding a particle and that defined<br>
by the slip plane for a particle are not the same things. The counter-ion layer thickness is<br>
the thickness of the solution layer around the particle that is required so as to contain<br>
enough counter-ions to "balance" the surface charge, while the slip plane involves the<br>
thickness of the solvent/ion film which moves with the particle.<br>
Zeta potential (x ) is the electric potential that exists at the "slip plane" - the<br>
interface between the hydrated particle and the bulk solution. It is the measurable<br>
potential of a solid surface and also called electrokinetic potential. According to the<br>
electrostatic principles zeta potential is calculated by the equation,<br><br>
d : thickness of the electrical double layer<br>
s : the electrical charge in the Stern layer<br>
D : dielectrical constant.<br>
The relationship between the value of the zeta potential and flocculation or<br>
dispersion in the sugar process liquid (4) favors flocculation of colloidal particles or other<br>
particles at low zeta potential values and favors dispersion of colloidal particles at high<br>
zeta potential values.<br>
As to certain embodiments of the invention, the amount of energy imparted to the<br>
sugar process liquid (4) by increasing velocity, distribution, and delivery of at least one<br>
gas (38) into the flow of sugar process liquid (4) in the containment zone (37) can be<br>
adjusted to overcome the zeta potential of the colloidal particles in the sugar process<br>
liquid (4) to promote additional particle to particle collisions. As a non-limiting<br>
example, sugar process liquid (4) can be flowed through the juice distribution element<br>
(41)(without limitation a BEX PSW 3FPS140) at about 200 gallons per minute to about .<br>
300 gallons per minute (between about 27 cubic feet per minute and 40 cubic feet per<br><br>
minute) at a pressure of about 10 psi to about 40 psi. Between about 108 cubic feet and<br>
about 160 cubic feet per minute of gas (38) (air or atmosphere) can be delivered into the<br>
dispersion of that amount of sugar process liquid (4) as it passes through the containment<br>
zone (37). Conditioned sugar process liquid (4) manifests a more rapid production of<br>
floc as pH is increased (typically from a range of between about 5.5 pH 6.5 pH to a range<br>
of between about 11.5 pH to about 11.8 pH) and increased juice purity with lower sugar<br>
color.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figures 2 and 6, a conventional sugar process system<br>
can be compared with an embodiment of a sugar process system in accordance with the<br>
invention. A conventional sugar process system processing about 335 tons of sugar beet<br>
cossettes (2) per hour (see Figure 1) can generate a "thin juice" purity after the second<br>
carbonation (20) of about 91.82 percent (see Figure 2). A sugar process system which<br>
further includes an aeration chamber (37) and a vacuum chamber (42) in accordance with<br>
the invention processing the same tonnage of sugar beet cosettes can generate a "thin<br>
juice" purity of about 93.02 percent.<br>
Now referring to Figures 4 and 8, the same conventional sugar process system as<br>
described above can generate a sugar process liquid (4) separated from sugar crystals<br>
from the "white pan" (24) of about 93.52 percent while the sugar process system which<br>
further includes an aeration chamber (37) and a vacuum chamber (42) in accordance with<br>
the invention generates a sugar process liquid (4) separated from sugar crystals from the<br>
"white pan" of about 94.17 percent.<br>
Again referring to Figures 4 and 8, the conventional sugar process system<br>
operated as described above generates about 49.92 tons of sugar per hour having a color<br>
of 37 RBU while the sugar process system in accordance with the invention which further<br>
includes an aeration chamber (36) and a vacuum chamber (42) can generate a greater<br>
amount of sugar (33) about 51.55 tons of sugar per hour having a lower color of 34 RBU.<br>
The additional 1.63 tons of sugar (33) per hour equates to about S5,700.00 of revenue per<br>
day.<br><br>
While additional sugar (33) production may vary in a sugar process system<br>
operated in accordance with the invention, additional revenue calculated for a 200 day<br>
campaign can easily be in excess of $1,000,000.00.<br>
The following further non-limiting examples along with the description above are<br>
sufficient for the person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the numerous and<br>
varied embodiments of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet cossettes. A<br>
control group and an experimental group each consisting of six substantially identical 500<br>
mL aliquots of the diffusion juice were generated. Each aliquot within the control group<br>
and the experimental group was analyzed to ascertain the pH value. As to each aliquot of<br>
the diffusion juice in the control group the pH value was about 6.3. Each aliquot within<br>
the control group without any further treatment was titrated to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a<br>
solution of 50% wt./vol. caustic soda. Each aliquot within the experimental group was<br>
treated in accordance with the invention after which the pH of each aliquot was<br>
ascertained and each experimental aliquot titrated in substantially identical fashion to the<br>
control group to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 50% wt./vol. caustic soda.<br>
The results are set out in Table 1 below. As can be understood from the table each<br>
aliquot of juice prior to any treatment had a pH of about 6.3. The experimental group<br>
after treatment in accordance with the invention had increased pH values without the<br>
addition of any base, and required a reduced amount of caustic soda to achieve the 11.2<br>
pH endpoint as compared to the control group.<br><br><br>
The reduction in the amount of caustic soda to reach the 11.2 pH endpoint for the<br>
aliquots of juice in the experimental group treated in accordance with the invention as<br>
compared to the aliquots of juice in the untreated control group was between about 15.8%<br>
and about 22.2%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2,<br>
Juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet cossettes. A<br>
control group and an experimental group each consisting of five substantially identical<br>
500 mL aliquots of the diffusion juice were generated. Each aliquot within the control<br>
group and the experimental group was analyzed to ascertain the pH value. As to each<br>
aliquot of the diffusion juice in the control group the pH value was about 6.1. Each<br>
aliquot within the control group without any further treatment was titrated to an 11.2 pH<br>
endpoint with a solution of 30 brixs milk of lime. Each aliquot within the experimental<br>
group was treated in accordance with the invention after which the pH of each aliquot<br>
was ascertained and each experimental aliquot titrated in substantially identical fashion to<br>
the control group to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 30 brixs milk of lime.<br>
The results are set out in Table 2 below. As can be understood from the table each<br>
aliquot of juice prior to any treatment had a pH of about 6.1. The experimental group<br>
after treatment in accordance with the invention had increased pH values without the<br><br>
addition of any base, and required a reduced amount of milk of lime to achieve the 11.2<br>
pH endpoint as compared to the control group.<br><br>
The reduction in the amount of milk of lime to reach the 11.2 pH endpoint for the<br>
aliquots of juice in the experimental group treated in accordance with the invention as<br>
compared to the aliquots of juice in the untreated control group was between about 25.0%<br>
and about 28.3%.<br>
Also, the data set out in Table 1 and Table 2 provides a comparison of two<br>
different types of diffusion apparatus and diffusion methods.. Importantly, the data shows<br>
that different diffusers or different diffusion methods can generate diffusion juice having<br>
significantly different pH values even though pH values attributed to each type of<br>
diffusion technology can be substantially internally consistent. See for example the initial<br>
pH value of the untreated diffusion juice in Table 1 which shows a pH value of 6.3 as<br>
compared to the untreated diffusion juice in Table 2 which a pH value of 6.1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3.<br>
Diffusion juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet<br>
cossettes and treated in accordance with the invention using the embodiment shown by<br>
Figures 12 and 13 having location between the mixer and the pre-limer. Diffusion juice<br>
dispersed at a rate of about 100 cubic foot per minute into a flow of atmospheric gases<br>
generated at a rate of about 400 cubic foot per minute (counter current path of 72 inches x<br><br>
72 inches with couter current path height of about 144 inches) generated transfer a variety<br>
of substances from the dispersed juice as identified by gas chromatograph/mass spectra<br>
analysis shown in Tables 1 and 2 below:<br><br>
Table 3 shows gas chromatography analysis of samples SMBSC 1 and SMBSC 2<br>
(condensates obtained from gas flow after counter current exchange with juice as<br>
described herein) with the chromatographs of those samples compared with a gas<br>
chromatograph of a sample of a standard mixture of organic acids listed as 1-9 above. As<br>
can be understood, treatment of juice in accordance with the invention removed varying<br>
amounts of each organic acid included in the standard mixture.<br><br><br>
Table 4 shows gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry analysis of sample<br>
SMBSC 5 D (condensates obtained from gas flow after counter current exchange with<br>
juice as described herein without use of reduced pressure with a juice temperature of<br>
between 60°C and 70°C with the chromatograph of this sample showing various volatile<br>
compounds rising above a base line having a curvature predominated by a variety of<br>
alcohols.<br>
The basic concepts of the invention may be embodied and claimed in a<br>
variety of ways. The invention involves a juice conditioner system useful for the<br>
production of sugar, methods of making and using embodiments of the invention, and<br>
products generated by using the invention.<br>
