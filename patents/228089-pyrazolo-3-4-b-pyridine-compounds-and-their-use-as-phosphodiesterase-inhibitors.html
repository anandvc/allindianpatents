Salts, solvates, isomers, tautomeric forms, molecular weights, etc.<br>
Because of their potential use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are<br>
preferably pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts can<br>
include! acid or base addition salts.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be formed by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula (I) with a suitable inorganic or organic acid (such as hydrobromic,<br>
hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, succinic, maleic, formic, acetic, propionic,<br>
fumaric, citric, tartaric, lactic, benzoic, salicylic, glutamaic, aspartic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic such as 2-<br>
naphthalenesulfonic, or hexanoic acid), optionally in a suitable solvent such as an organic<br>
solvent, to give the salt which is usually isolated for example by crystallisation and<br>
filtration. A pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of formula (I)<br>
can be for example a hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, succinate,<br>
maleate, formate, acetate, propionate, fumarate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, benzoate,<br>
salicylate, glutamate, aspartate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, methanesulfonate,<br>
ethanesulfonate, naphthalenesulfonate (e.g. 2- naphthalenesulfonate) or hexanoate salt.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be a<br>
hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, succinate, maleate, acetate,<br>
fumarate, citrate, tartrate, benzoate, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or<br>
naphthalenesulfonate salt.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt can be formed by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula (I) with a suitable inorganic or organic base (e.g. triethylamine,<br>
ethanolamine, triethanolamine, choline, arginine, lysine or histidine), optionally in a<br>
suitable solvent such as an organic solvent, to give the base addition salt which is usually<br>
isolated for example by crystallisation and filtration.<br><br>
Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable metal salts, for example pharmaceutically acceptable alkali-metal or alkaline-<br>
earth-metal salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts; in particular<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts of one or more carboxylic acid moieties that may<br>
be present in the the compound of formula (I).<br>
Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts, eg. oxalates, may be used, for<br>
example in the isolation of compounds of the invention, and are included within the scope<br>
of this invention.<br>
The invention includes within its scope all possible stoichiometric and non-<br>
stoichiometric forms of the salts of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are all solvates, hydrates and<br>

isomers, including racemates, enantiomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Certain of the groups, e.g. heteroaromatic ring systems, included in compounds<br>

invention includes within its scope all such tautomeric forms, including mixtures. For<br>
example, when Het is of sub-formula (i), Y1 is CRY, and X1 is CRX wherein RX is OH,<br>
then the compounds of formula (I) or their salts include the keto form (Kl), the enol form<br>
(El), and mixtures thereof, as shown below, unless otherwise indicated; and when Het is<br>
of sub-formula (i) and Y1 is CRY wherein RY is OH, then the compounds of formula (I)<br>

Especially when intended for oral medicinal use, the compound of formula (I) can<br>
optionally have a molecular weight of 1000 or less, for example 800 or less, in particular<br>
650 or less or 600 or less. Molecular weight here refers to that of the unsolvated "free<br>
base" compound, that is excluding any molecular weight contributed by any addition<br>
salts, solvent (e.g. water) molecules, etc.<br>
Synthetic Process Routes<br>
The following processes can be used to make the compounds of formula (I) The<br>
methods are sometimes illustrated for the circumstance where R2 is H or Me. However,<br><br>
some or all of these processes are thought to be usable with appropriate modification, e.g.<br>
of starting materials and reagents, for making compounds of Formula (I) wherein R2 is<br>
C1fluoroalkyl.<br>
Process A<br>
Compounds of formula (T) which are compounds of Formula I(ia) (that is, compounds of<br>
formula (I) wherein Het is of sub-formula (ia)) can be prepared by the cyclisation reaction<br>
of a compound of Formula II, for example in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as<br>
phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3) or Burgess reagent<br>
[(Methoxycarbonylsulphamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide], and/or preferably in a<br>
suitable solvent (e.g. organic solvent, preferably anhydrous) such as acetonitrile (e.g. for<br>
POCl3) or THF and/or DMF (e.g. for Burgess reagent). The reaction may require heating,<br>
for example heating to from about 70 to about 150 °C or heating to from about 70 to<br>
about 120 °C or heating to from about 70 to about 90 °C:<br><br>
For the Formula II to Formula I(ia) cyclisation reaction, the conditions can for example<br>
be as described in (a) Examples 1-3 or 43 (POCl3 and acetonitrile), or (b) in Examples<br>
32, 34-37, 35 (alternative synthesis), 38-40,44, 66 or 97-125 (Burgess reagent, with THF<br>
and/or DMF).<br>
Compounds of Formula II may themselves be prepared by reacting a compound of<br>
Formula HI with a suitably substituted hydrazine derivative of formula RYCONHNH2,<br>
under standard coupling conditions. For example a coupling reagent such as<br>
1-(3-dimemylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) may be used e.g.<br>
in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), for example in a suitable solvent such<br>
as DMF:<br><br><br>
Where the required hydrazine derivative RYCONHNH2 is not readily available,<br>
compounds of Formula II may alternatively be prepared by initially reacting a compound<br>
of Formula m with a carbazate ROCONHNH2 such as t-butylcarbazate tBuOCONHNH2<br>
under coupling conditions to form a compound of formula IV. For example a coupling<br>
reagent such as EDC may be used, e.g. in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole, for<br>
example in a suitable solvent such as DMF:<br><br>
Subsequent Boc-deprotection of the resultant acid hydrazide derivative (compound of<br>
Formula IV) to afford a hydrazide derivative of Formula V, can be achieved using a<br>
dilute acid such as 2M hydrochloric acid in an organic solvent such as dioxane.<br>
The compound of Formula V can be converted to the compound of Formula II (the<br>
desired hydrazide derivative). This can be achieved by reaction of the compound of<br>
Formula V with an acid of formula RYCO2H under coupling conditions. For example a<br>
coupling agent such as EDC may be used e.g. in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole<br><br>
(HOBT), for example in a suitable solvent such as DMF. Alternatively, an activated acid<br>
derivative of formula RYCO-X10 where X is a leaving group such as chloro (acid<br>
chloride) or -O-CO-R30 or -O-SO2-R30 (where R30 can e.g. be RY or alkyl or aryl such<br>
as methyl, t-butyl or p-methylphenyl) may be used to effect formation of a hydrazide of<br>
Formula II, through reaction with a hydrazide derivative of Formula V.<br>
Compounds of Formula EI can be prepared by hydrolysis of an ester of Formula VI (for<br>
example RA can be C1-2alkyl such as Et), for example according to the method<br>
described by Yu et. al. in J. Med Chem., 2001, 44,1025-1027. This hydrolysis procedure<br>
usually involves reaction with a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide<br>
in a solvent such as ethanol or dioxane (e.g. NaOH in EtOH), one or both solvents<br>
preferably containing some water:<br><br>
Compounds of Formula VI can be prepared, e.g. according to the method described by<br>
Yu et. al. in J. Med Chem., 2001,44,1025-1027, by reaction of a compound of Formula<br>
VII with an amine of Formula R3R3aNH. The reaction is best carried out in the presence<br>
of abase such as trieraylamine or diisopropylethyl amine in a solvent such as ethanol or<br>
dioxane (e.g. NEta in EtOH) and may require heating:<br><br>
Many amines of Formula R3R3aNH, e.g. those amines wherein R3R3aN are of sub-<br>
formulae (a) to (t2), are either commercially available, or syntheses therefor have been<br>
published and/or described herein, or they can be prepared from commercially available<br>
or synthesizable compounds e.g. from other amines of Formula R3R3aNH or derivatives<br>
thereof. For amines R3R3aNH whose preparations and/or specific commercial sources<br>
are described herein, see e.g. Intermediates 21,21A, 25, 50, 54-57, and 140-163.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula VII are also described in the above reference and can. be prepared<br>
first by reaction of a compound of Formula VIH with, for example, diethyl<br>
(ethoxymethylene)malonate (R2 = H, to afford RA = Et) or diethyl<br>
2-(1-ethoxyethylidene)malonate (R2 = Me, to afford RA = Et), e.g. with heating,<br>
followed by reaction with phosphorous oxychloride, again preferably with heating. See<br>
for example Intermediate 1 synthesis and G. Yu et. al., J. Med Chem., 2001,44,1025-<br>
1027 hereinafter, where R2 = H and R1 = ethyl; and see Intermediate 58 synthesis<br>
hereinafter where R2 = Me and R1 = ethyl:<br><br>
Where, for example, the desired amino pyrazole of Formula Vm is not commercially<br>
available, preparation of the Formula VIH pyrazole can be achieved, for example using<br>
methods described by Dorgan et. al. in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1980,1 (4), 938-42,<br>
involving reaction of cyanoethyl hydrazine with a suitable aldehyde R1aCHO in a solvent<br>
such as ethanol, with heating, followed by reduction, for example reduction with sodium<br>
in a solvent such as t-butanol. R1a should be chosen so as to contain one less carbon atom<br>
than R1, for example Rla= methyl will afford R1 = ethyl.<br><br>
Alternatively, e.g. where the desired amino pyrazole of Formula VIII is not commercially<br>
available, preparation of the compound of Formula VI can be achieved from the<br>
compound of Formula VII (e.g. Intermediate 1 wherein Rl = ethyl), using a generalised<br>
version of the reaction scheme shown in Example 43, especially that part relating to<br>
conversion of Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 38. In this method: the 4-chloro<br>
pyrazolopyridine of Formula VII (e.g. Intermediate 1) is optionally converted to the 4-<br>
alkoxy (e.g. C1-4alkoxy such as ethoxy) pyrazolopyridine (e.g. Intermediate 35); the R1<br>
group is removed (to e.g. Intermediate 36 wherein R^ is H rather than alkyl), the 4-amino<br>
R3R3aN group is inserted by displacing the 4-chloro or 4-alkoxy group by reaction with<br>
R3R3aNH (e.g. to Intermediate 37); and the pyrazolopyridine is alkylated at N-1 by<br>
reacting it with R1-X40 where X40 is a group displaceable by the N-1 nitrogen of the<br>
pyrazolopyridine in order to re-insert the desired R1 group (e.g. Intermediate 38<br><br>
synthesis). X40 can for example be a halogen, e.g. CI, Br or I; or X40 can be<br>
-O-SO2-R40 where R40 is C1-2alkyl, C1-2fluoroalkyl, or phenyl optionally substituted<br>
by C1-2alkyl.<br>
Process B<br>
Compounds of formula (I) which are compounds of Formula I(ia) (that is, compounds of<br>
formula (I) wherein Het is of sub-formula (ia)) can alternatively be prepared by reaction<br>
of a compound of Formula IX with an amine of formula R3R3 aNH, preferably in a<br>
solvent (e.g. organic solvent) such as ethanol or acetonitrile, and/or preferably in the<br>
presence of a base such as DIPEA. Heating may be required to effect the conversion:<br><br>

prepare the compound of Formula I(ia), the reaction conditions, e.g. solvents, mole ratios,<br>
temperatures and/or reaction times, can optionally be as described in Examples 9,10-11<br>
and/or 12-27.<br>
The reaction of Formula DC with R3R3aNH to give Formula I(ia) can be generalised for<br>
any compound of Formula (I), containing any Het group as defined herein, starting from a<br>
compound of Formula DCa:<br><br>
Compounds of Formula DC can themselves be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of<br>
Formula X, preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent such asphosphorous<br>
oxychloride or Burgess reagent [(Methoxycarbonylsulphamoyl)triethylammonium<br>
hydroxide], in a suitable solvent (e.g. organic solvent, preferably anhydrous) such as<br><br>
acetonitrile (e.g. for POCl3) or THF and/or DMF (e.g. for Burgess reagent). The reaction<br>
may require heating, for example heating to from about 70 to about 150 °C or heating to<br>
from about 70 to about 120 °C or heating to from about 70 to about 90 °C:<br><br>
Compounds of Formula X can be prepared by initial activation of an acid of Formula XI,<br>
for example with an amide coupling reagent such as EDC/HOBT or with thionyl chloride,<br>
followed by reaction of the thus formed activated intermediate with an acid hydrazide of<br>

as acetonitrile. The reaction may require heating:<br><br>

presence of a base such as sodium ethoxide and/or preferably in a suitable solvent (e.g.<br>
anhydrous and/or organic solvent) such as ethanol, and preferably in the presence of<br>

Formula m with a suitably substituted hydrazine derivative of Formula RZNHNH2, under<br>
coupling conditions. For example a coupling agent such as EDC may be used, e.g. in the<br>
presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), in a suitable solvent such as DMF:<br><br>
Process F<br>
To make a compound of formula (I) wherein Het is of sub-formula (id) (optionally<br>
substituted l,3-oxazo1-2-yl), methods known to the skilled person can be used.<br>
For example, the 5-carboxylic acid compound of Formula HI can be converted directly or<br>
indirectly to a compound of formula (I) wherein Het is of sub-formula (id) (i.e. to a 5-<br>
(optionally-substituted l,3-oxazo1-2-yl)-pyrazolopyridine). Alternatively or additionally,<br>
a compound of formula (I), wherein Het is of sub-formula (va) in which RX1 and RY1<br>
are H and RX1 is RX and RY1 is RY [i.e. the corresponding 5-(optionally-substituted<br>
4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazo1-2-yl)-pyrazolopyridine], can be dehydrogenated to a compound of<br>
formula (I) wherein Het is of sub-formula (id); e.g. by the method shown in Example 41<br>
(DBU, CCl4, CH3CN, Pyridine) or a modification of this method or by an analogous<br>
method for example using an oxidising agent.<br>
The dehydrogenation (oxidation) of the 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazo1-2-yl compound of<br>

R10R11NH, under coupling conditions. Standard coupling conditions can be used<br>
known to the skilled person. For example a coupling agent such as TBTU may be used,<br>
preferably in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole. However, it is more preferable that<br>
the coupling agent is oxalyl chloride, which in the reaction forms the corresponding acid<br>
chloride from the carboxylic acid of the compound of Formula XVII; in this embodiment<br>
it is preferable that the acid chloride is not isolated, i.e. the solvent in which it is formed<br>
is preferably not removed to a substantial extent. Preferably, whatever the coupling agent<br>
/ coupling conditions, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as<br>
diisopropylethylamine, and/or in a suitable solvent (e.g. organic solvent, preferably<br>

reaction with R^C(O)X^ where X&amp; is a leaving group, preferably in a solvent such as<br>
acetic acid, pyridine, diglyme and/or dichloromethane. XK can for example be chloro;<br>
or RYC(O)XK can be an anhydride such as [RY(C=O)]2O; or RYC(O)XK can be an<br>
activated carboxylic acid derivative prepared from the reaction of RYC(O)OH with a<br>
coupling reagent such as EDC or TBTU with or without the presence of HOBT.<br><br><br>
For the Formula XXV to Formula XXW reaction, the reaction conditions can for<br>
example be as described in Examples 188,189 and/or 190.<br>
Compounds of the type Formula XXV can be prepared from compounds of the type<br>
Formula XXVI by reaction with hydroxylamine or a hydroxylamine salt, preferably in the<br>
presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium alkoxide or a tertiary amine,<br>
and/or preferably in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or methanol:<br><br>
Compounds of the type Formula XXVI may themselves be prepared from compounds of<br>
Formula XXVII by reaction with a dehydrating agent such as Burgess Reagent,<br>
preferably in a solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran:<br><br>
Compounds of the type Formula XXVII can be prepared from carboxylic acid<br>
compounds of Formula IE, for example by reaction with thionyl chloride followed by<br>
ammonia in a suitable solvent such as dioxane:<br><br><br>
Process L - Conversion of a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof into a<br>
different compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof<br>
One compound of formula (I) or salt thereof can be converted into another compound of<br>
formula (I) or salt thereof. This conversion preferably comprises or is one or more of the<br>
following processes LI to L10:<br>
LI. An oxidation process. For example, the oxidation process can comprise or be<br>
oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone (e.g. using Jones reagent) or oxidation of an alcohol or<br>
a ketone to a carboxylic acid.<br>
L2. A reduction process, for example reduction of a ketone or a carboxylic acid to an<br>
alcohol.<br>
L3. Acylation, for example acylation of an amine or of a hydroxy group.<br>
L4. Alkylation, for example alkylation of an amine or of a hydroxy group.<br>
L5. Hydrolysis, e.g. hydrolysis of an ester to the corresponding carboxylic acid or salt<br>
thereof, for example in the presence of base (e.g. alkali-metal hydroxide, preferably also<br>
in the presence of water) or in the presence of acid (e.g. aqueous HCl, or HCl in an<br>
anhydrous organic solvent such as dioxane).<br>
The hydrolysis can for example be hydrolysis of an ester compound, in which RX,<br>
RX2, RY or RY2 is -(CH2)n12-C(O)-OR13 wherein R13 is not a hydrogen atom (H), to<br>
the corresponding carboxylic acid wherein R13 is a hydrogen atom (H). See for example<br>
Example 57 and Intermediate 83.<br>
The hydrolysis can for example be hydrolysis of an ester compound, wherein R3<br>
is substituted by -C(O)OR23 in which R23 is C1-2alkyl (e.g. NHR3 or NR3R3a is of<br>
sub-formula (p8)), to the corresponding carboxylic acid or salt thereof wherein R23 is H<br>
(e.g. NHR3 or NR3R3a is of sub-formula (p7)).<br>
L6. Deprotection, e.g. deprotection (e.g. deacylation or t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC)<br>
removal or benzyloxycarbonyl removal) of an amine group.<br><br>
L7. Formation of an ester or amide, for example from the corresponding carboxylic acid<br>
and/or an activated derivative of the carboxylic acid (e.g. acid chloride or acid anhydride<br>
or carboxylic acid activated by a coupling agent).<br>
The amide formation can be formation of an amide compound, in which one or<br>
more of Rx, RX2, RY and RY2 is -(CH2)n1 1-C(O)-NR10Rl 1,<br>
-CH(C1-2alkyl)-C(O)-NR10R11, -CMe2-C(O)-NR10R11 or cycloalkyl substituted by<br>
-C(O)-NR10R11, from the corresponding carboxylic acid and/or an activated derivative<br>
of the carboxylic acid. For examples of this amide formation, see Examples 58-59 and/or<br>
126-147 for Het = sub-formula (id), and/or Process G herein for Het = sub-formula (ic)<br>
(e.g. Examples 85-90, 95-96 and/or 148-155).<br>
The amide formation can alternatively be formation of an amide compound, in<br>
which one or more of Rx, RX2, RY and RY2 is -(CH2)n4-NR6R7,<br>
-CH(C1-2alkyl)-NR6R7, -CMe2-NR6R7 or cycloalkyl substituted by -NR6R7, wherein<br>
R6 is C(O)R17, from the corresponding carboxylic acid and/or an activated derivative of<br>
the carboxylic acid. For one example where Het is of sub-formula (ic) see Process H<br>
and/or Examples 159-165.<br>
L8. Conversion of a ketone into the corresponding oxime or oxime ether. This can for<br>
example include conversion of an oxo (=O) substituent within R3, e.g. within the NHR3<br>
or NR3R3a sub-formula (o), into anhydroxyimino (=N-OH) or (C1-4alkoxy)imino<br>
(=N-OR26) substituent within R3, e.g. within the NHR3 or NR3R3a sub-formula (o2),<br>
(o3), (o4) or (o5). This conversion can be carried out in the case of an oxime<br>
(hydroxyimino, =N-OH) by reacting hydroxylamine or a salt thereof (e.g. hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride) with the ketone, or in the case of an oxime ether (C1-4alkoxy)irmno,<br>
=N-OR26) by reacting C1-4alkoxylamine or a salt thereof (e.g. hydrochloride salt) with<br>
the ketone. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base such as<br>
anhydrous potassium carbonate or diisopropylethylarnine and/or in a suitable solvent such<br>
as acetonitrile. The mixture can be heated e.g. to reflux.<br>
L9. Sulfonylation, e.g. sulfonamide formation by reaction of an amine with a sulfonyl<br>
halide e.g. a sulfonyl chloride (e.g. see also Process I).<br>
and/or<br>
L10. Beckmann rearrangement of one compound of formula (I) into another compound<br>
of formula (I). Preferably, this uses cyanuric chloride (2,4,6-trichloro-l,3,5-triazine)<br>
together with a forrnamide such as DMF, e.g. at room temperature (see L.D. Luca, J. Org.<br>
Chem., 2002, 67, 6272-6274). The Beckmann rearrangement can for example comprise<br>
conversion of an (hydroxyimino)cycloalkyl compound of formula (I), e.g. wherein NHR3<br><br>
or NR.3R3 a is of sub-formula (o2) , into a single-atom-ring-expanded<br>
lactam compound of formula (I), e.g. wherein NHR3 or NR3R3a is of sub-formula (m3)<br>

formula (I) or a salt thereof, comprising:<br>

"Therapy" may include treatment and/or prophylaxis.<br>
Also provided is the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament (e.g. pharmaceutical composition) for the<br>
treatment and/or prophylaxis of any of the diseases / conditions described herein in a<br>

and/or allergic disease in a mammal such as a human.<br>
Also provided is a method of treatment and/or prophylaxis of any of the diseases /<br>
conditions described herein in a mammal (e.g. human) in need thereof, e.g. a method of<br>
treatment and/or prophylaxis of an inflammatory and/or allergic disease in a mammal<br>
(e.g. human) in need thereof, which method comprises administering to the mammal (e.g.<br>
human) a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as herein defined<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors are thought to be useful in the treatment and/or<br>

PDE4 inhibitors are thought to be effective in the treatment of COPD (e.g. see S.L.<br>
Wolda, Emerging Drugs, 2000, 5(3), 309-319; Z. Huang et al., Current Opinion in<br>
Chemical Biology, 2001, 5: 432-438; H.J.Dyke et al., Expert Opinion on Investigational<br>
Drugs, January 2002, 11(1), 1-13; C.Burnouf et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design,<br>

473; and refs cited therein). COPD is often characterised by the presence of airflow<br>
obstruction due to chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema (SL Wolda, Emerging Drugs,<br>
2000, 5(3), 309-319).<br>
PDE4 inhibitors are thought to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (e.g. see<br>
B.M. Schmidt et al., J. Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology, 108(4), 2001, 530-536).<br>
PDE4 inhibitors are thought to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and<br>
multiple sclerosis (e.g. see H.J.Dyke et al., Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs,<br>
January 2002, 11(1), 1-13; CBurnouf etal., Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2002,<br>
8(14), 1255-1296; and A.M.Doherty, Current Opinion Chem. Biol, 1999, 3(4), 466-473;<br><br>
and refs cited therein). See e.g. A.M.Doherty, Current Opinion Chem. Biol, 1999, 3(4),<br>
466-473 and refs cited therein for atopic dermatitis use.<br>
PDE4 inhibitors have been suggested as having analgesic properties and thus being<br>
effective in the treatment of pain (A.Kumar et al., Indian J. Exp. Biol, 2000, 38(1), 26-<br>
30).<br>
In the invention, the treatment and/or prophylaxis can be of cognitive impairment e.g.<br>
cognitive impairment in a neurological disorder such as Alzheimer's disease. For<br>
example, the treatment and/or prophylaxis can comprise cognitive enhancement e.g. in a<br>
neurological disorder. See for example: H.T.Zhang et al. in: Psychopharmacology, June<br>
2000,150(3), 311-316 and Neuropsychopharmacology, 2000,23(2), 198-204; and T.<br>
Egawa et al., Japanese J. Pharmacol, 1997,75(3), 275-81.<br>
PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have been suggested as having antidepressant<br>
properties (e.g. J. Zhu et al., CNSDrug Reviews, 2001, 7(4), 387-398; O'Donnell, Expert<br>
Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 2000,9(3), 621-625; andH.T. Zhang et al.,<br>
Neuropsychopharmacology, October 2002,27(4), 587-595).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and dosing<br>
For use in medicine, the compounds of the present invention are usually<br>
administered as a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The present invention therefore provides in a further aspect a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be for use in the treatment and/or<br>
prophylaxis of any of the conditions described herein.<br>
The invention also provides a method of preparing a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I), as herein defined, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or<br>
excipients,<br>
the method comprising mixing the compound or salt with the one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition prepared by said<br>
method.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and/or the pharmaceutical composition may be<br>
administered, for example, by oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, or<br>
intramuscular), inhaled or nasal administration. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is preferably suitable for oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, or<br>
intramuscular), inhaled or nasal administration. More preferably, the pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition is suitable for inhaled or oral administration, e.g. to a mammal such as a<br>
human. Inhaled administration involves topical administration to the lung e.g. by aerosol<br>
or dry powder composition. Oral administration to a human is most preferred.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration can be liquid or<br>
solid; for example it can be a syrup, suspension or emulsion, a tablet, a capsule or a<br>
lozenge.<br>
A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the<br>
compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
liquid carrier(s), for example an aqueous solvent such as water, ethanol or glycerine, or a<br>
non-aqueous solvent, such as polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation may also<br>
contain a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring and/or colouring agent.<br>
In one preferable embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dose<br>
form such as a tablet or capsule for oral administration, e.g. for oral administration to a<br>
human.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration being a<br>
tablet can comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients<br>
suitable for preparing tablet formulations. The carrier can for example be or include<br>
lactose, cellulose (for example microcrystalline cellulose), or mannitol. The tablet can<br>
also or instead contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for example a<br>
binding agent such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or povidone (polyvinylpyrollidone),<br>
a lubricant e.g. an alkaline earth metal stearate such as magnesium stearate, and/or a<br>
tablet disintegrant such as sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium, or<br>
crospovidone (cross-linked polyvinylpyrollidone). The pharmaceutical composition<br>
being a tablet can be prepared by a method comprising the steps of: (i) mixing the<br>
compound of formula (I), as herein defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
with the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients, (ii)<br>
compressing the resulting mixture (which is usually in powder form) into tablets, and (iii)<br>
optionally coating the tablet with a tablet film-coating material.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration being a capsule can<br>
be prepared using encapsulation procedures. For example, pellets or powder containing<br>
the active ingredient can be prepared using a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule. Alternatively, a dispersion or suspension can<br>
be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for example an<br>
aqueous gum or an oil and the dispersion or suspension then filled into a soft gelatin<br>
capsule.<br>
A parenteral composition can comprise a solution or suspension of the compound<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable<br>
oil. Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised; the lyophilised parenteral<br>
pharmaceutical composition can be reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to<br>
administration.<br>
Compositions for nasal or inhaled administration may conveniently be formulated<br>
as aerosols, drops, gels or dry powders.<br><br>
Aerosol formulations, e.g. for inhaled administration, can comprise a solution or<br>
fine suspension of the active substance in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous solvent. Aerosol formulations can be presented in single or multidose quantities<br>
in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for<br>
use with an atomising device or inhaler. Alternatively the sealed container may be a<br>
unitary dispensing device such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted<br>
with a metering valve (metered dose inhaler) which is intended for disposal once the<br>
contents of the container have been exhausted.<br>
Where the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it preferably contains a<br>
suitable propellant under pressure such as compressed air, carbon dioxide, or an organic<br>
propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC). Suitable<br>
CFC propellants include dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane and<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane. Suitable HFC propellants include 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-<br>
heptafluoropropane and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. The aerosol dosage forms can also<br>
take the form of a pump-atomiser.<br>
Particle size reduction of compound of formula (I) or salt thereof<br>
For pharmaceutical compositions suitable and/or adapted for inhaled<br>
administration, it is preferred that the compound or salt of formula (I) is in a particle-size-<br>
reduced form, and more preferably the size-reduced form is obtained or obtainable by<br>
micronisation. Micronisation usually involves subjecting the compound/salt to collisional<br>
and abrasional forces in a fast-flowing circular or spiral/vortex-shaped airstream often<br>
including a cyclone component. The preferable particle size (e.g. D50 value) of the size-<br>
reduced (e.g. micronised) compound or salt is about 0.5 to about 10 microns, e.g. about 1<br>
to about 5 microns (e.g. as measured using laser diffraction). For example, it is<br>
preferable for the compound or salt of formula (I) to have a particle size defined by: a<br>
D10 of about 0.3 to about 3 microns (e.g. about 1 micron), and/or a D50 of about 1 to<br>
about 5 microns (e.g. about 2-5 or about 2-3 microns), and/or a D90 of about 2 to about<br>
20 microns or about 3 to about 10 microns (e.g. about 5-8 or about 5-6 microns); for<br>
example as measured using laser diffraction. The laser diffraction measurement can use a<br>
dry method (suspension of compound/salt in airflow crosses laser beam) or a wet method<br>
[suspension of compound/salt in liquid dispersing medium, such as isooctane or (e.g. if<br>
compound soluble in isooctane) 0.1% Tween 80 in water, crosses laser beam]. With laser<br>
diffraction, particle size is preferably calculated using the Fraunhofer calculation; and/or<br>
preferably a Malvern Mastersizer or Sympatec apparatus is used for measurement.<br>
An illustrative non-limiting example of a smal1-scale micronisation process is now given:<br>
Micronisation Example<br>
• Purpose: To micronize a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof- in particular one<br>
of the Examples of the invention (described hereinafter) - usually in an amount of<br>
approximately 600-1000 mg, using a JetpharmaMCl micronizer.<br><br>
• The parent (unmicronised) and micronised materials are analyzed for particle size by<br>
laser diffraction and crystallinity by PXRD.<br><br>
The Jetpharma MCI Micronizer comprises a horizontal disc-shaped milling housing<br>
having: a tubular compound inlet (e.g. angled at ca. 30degrees to the horizontal) for entry<br>
of a suspension of unmicronised compound of formula (I) or salt in an gasflow, a separate<br>
gas inlet for entry of gases, a gas outlet for exit of gases, and a collection vessel for<br>
collecting micronised material. The milling housing has two chambers: an outer annular<br>
chamber in gaseous connection with the gas inlet the chamber being for receiving<br>
pressurised gas (e.g. air or nitrogen), an disc-shaped inner milling chamber within and<br>
coaxial with the outer chamber for micronising the input compound / salt, the two<br>
chambers being separated by an annular wall. The annular wall (ring R) has a plurality of<br>
narrow-bored holes connecting the inner and outer chambers and circurnferentially-<br>
spaced-apart around the annular wall. The holes open into the inner chamber directed at<br>
an angle (directed part-way between radially and tangentially), and in use act as nozzles<br>
directing pressurised gas at high velocity from the outer chamber into the inner chamber<br>
and in an inwardly-spiral path (vortex) around the inner chamber (cyclone). The<br>
compound inlet is is gaseous communication with the inner chamber via a nozzle directed<br>
tangentially to the inner chamber, within and near to the annular wall. Upper and lower<br>
broad-diameter exit vents in the central axis of the the inner milling chamber connect to<br>
(a) (lower exit) the collection vessel which has no air outlet, and (b) (upper exit) the gas<br>
outlet which leads to a collection bag, filter and a gas exhaust. Inside the tubular<br>
compound inlet and longitudinally-movable within it is positioned a venturi inlet (V) for<br>
entry of gases. The compound inlet also has a bifurcation connecting to an upwardly-<br>
directed material inlet port for inputting material.<br>
In use, the narrow head of the venturi inlet (V) is preferably positioned below and<br>
slightly forward of the material inlet port so that when the venturi delivers pressurised gas<br>
(eg air or nitrogen) the feed material is sucked into the gasstream thorough the compound<br>
inlet and accelerates it into the inner milling chamber tangentially at a subsonic speed.<br>
Inside the milling chamber the material is further accelerated to a supersonic speed by the<br>
hole/nozzle system around the ring (R) (annular wall) of the milling chamber. The<br>
nozzles are slightly angled so that the acceleration pattern of the material is in the form of<br><br>
an inwardly-directed vortex or cyclone. The material inside the milling chamber<br>
circulates rapidly and particle collisions occur during the process, causing larger particles<br>
to fracture into smaller ones. "Centrifugal" acceleration in the vortex causes the larger<br>
particles to remain at the periphery of the inner chamber while progressively smaller<br>
particles move closer to the center until they exit the milling chamber, generally through<br>
the lower exit, at low pressure and low velocity. The particles that exit the milling<br>
chamber are heavier than air and settle downward thorugh the lower exit into the<br>
collection vessel, while the exhaust gas rises (together with a miinority of small particles<br>
of micronised material) and escapes into the atmosphere at low pressure and low velocity.<br>
Procedure:<br>
The micronizer is assembled. The venturi protrusion distance from input port is<br>
adjusted to 1.0cm respectively (e.g. so that the narrow head of the venturi inlet is<br>
positioned below and slightly forward of the material inlet port) and is measured with a<br>
micro-caliper to make sure that it is inserted correctly. The ring (R) and venturi (V)<br>
pressures are adjusted according to the values specified in the experimental design (refer<br>
to experimental section below) by adjusting the valves on the pressure gauges on the<br>
micronizer. The setup is checked for leakage by observing if there is any fluctuation in<br>
the reading of the pressure gauges.<br>
Note that the venturi (V) pressure is kept at least 2 bars greater than the ring (R )<br>
pressure to prevent regurgitation of material, e.g. outwardly from the material inlet port.<br>
Balance performance is checked with calibration weights. Specified amount of<br>
the parent material (see section on experimental run) is weighed into a plastic weigh boat.<br>
The material is then fed into the micronizer using a vibrational spatula (e.g. V-shaped in<br>
cross-section) at a specified feed rate. The material feeding time and equipment pressures<br>
are monitored during the micronization process.<br>
Upon completion of the micronising run, the nitrogen supply is shut off and the<br>
collection bag is tapped to allow particles to settle into the recovery / collection vessel at<br>
the bottom of the micronizer. The collection bag is removed and set aside. The<br>
micronised powder in the recovery vessel (collection vessel) and the cyclone (above the<br>
recovery vessel) are collected separately into different weighed+labelled collection vials.<br>
The weight of the micronised material is recorded. The micronizer is disassembled and<br>
residual PDE4 compound on the micronizer inner surface is rinsed with 70/30 isopropyl<br>
alcohol / water and collected into a flask. The micronizer is then thoroughly cleaned by<br>
rinsing and wiping with suitable solvent and dried before subsequent runs are performed.<br>
Preferred Experimental Parameters<br>
Balance(s) Used: Sartorius analytical<br>
Venturi outlet insertion depth: 10.0 mm<br><br><br><br>
The above preferred or optional parameters can be varied using the skilled person's<br>
knowledge.<br>
Yield calculations<br>
% yield = [(Material from vessel + Material from cyclone)/Material input amount] x 100<br>
In general, very approximately 50-75 % yields are achievable using this method.<br>
Dry powder inhalable compositions<br>
For pharmaceutical compositions suitable and/or adapted for inhaled<br>
administration, it is preferred that the pharmaceutical composition is a dry powder<br>
inhalable composition. Such a composition can comprise a powder base such as lactose<br>
or starch, the compound of formula (I) or salt thereof (preferably in particle-size-reduced<br>
form, e.g. in micronised form), and optionally a performance modifier such as L-leucine,<br>
mannitol, trehalose and/or magnesium stearate. Preferably, the dry powder inhalable<br>
composition comprises a dry powder blend of lactose and the compound of formula (I) or<br>
salt thereof. The lactose is preferably lactose hydrate e.g. lactose monohydrate and/or is<br>
preferably inhalation-grade and/or fine-grade lactose. Preferably, the particle size of the<br>
lactose is defined by 90% or more (by weight or by volume) of the lactose particles being<br>
less than 1000 microns (micrometres) (e.g. 10-1000 microns e.g. 30-1000 microns) in<br>
diameter, and/or 50% or more of the lactose particles being less than 500 microns (e.g.<br>
10-500 microns) in diameter. More preferably, the particle size of the lactose is defined<br>
by 90% or more of the lactose particles being less than 300 microns (e.g. 10-300 microns<br>
e.g. 50-300 microns) in diameter, and/or 50% or more of the lactose particles being less<br>
than 100 microns in diameter. Optionally, the particle size of the lactose is defined by<br>
90% or more of the lactose particles being less than 100-200 microns in diameter, and/or<br>
50% or more of the lactose particles being less than 40-70 microns in diameter. Most<br>
importantly, it is preferable that about 3 to about 30% (e.g. about 10%) (by weight or by<br>
volume) of the particles are less than 50 microns or less than 20 microns in diameter. For<br>
example, without limitation, a suitable inhalation-grade lactose is E9334 lactose (10%<br>
fines) (Borculo Domo Ingredients, Hanzeplein 25, 8017 JD Zwolle, Netherlands).<br>
In the dry powder inhalable composition, preferably, the compound of formula (I)<br>
or salt thereof is present in about 0.1% to about 70% (e.g. about 1% to about 50%, e.g.<br>
about 5% to about 40%, e.g. about 20 to about 30%) by weight of the composition.<br><br>
An illustrative non-limiting example of a dry powder inhalable composition<br>
follows:<br>
Dry Powder Formulation Example - Dry powder Lactose Blend Preparation<br>
Using a size-reduced e.g. micronised form of the compound of formula (I) or salt thereof<br>
(e.g. as prepared in the Micronisatrion Example above), the dry powder blend is prepared<br>
by mixing the required amount of the compound/salt (e.g. 10 mg, 1% w/w) with<br>
inhalation-grade lactose containing 10% fines (e.g. 990 mg, 99% w/w) in a Teflon™<br>
(polytetrafluoroethene) pot in a Mikro-dismembrator bal1-mill (but without a ball bearing)<br>
at % speed (ca. 2000-2500 rpm) for about 4 hours at each blend concentration. The<br>
Mikro-dismembrator (available from B. Braun Biotech International, Schwarzenberger<br>
Weg 73-79, D-34212 Melsungen, Germany; www.bbraunbiotech.com) comprises a base<br>
with an upwardly-projecting and sidewardly-vibratable arm to which is attached the<br>
Teflon TM pot. The vibration of the arm achieves blending.<br>
Other blends: 10% w/w compound/salt (50 mg) + 90% w/w lactose (450 mg,<br>
inhalation-grade lactose containing 10% fines).<br>
Serial dilution of the 1% w/w blend can achieve e.g. 0.1% and 0.3% w/w blends.<br>
Dry powder inhalation devices<br>
Optionally, in particular for dry powder inhalable compositions, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for inhaled ad'ministration can be incorporated into a plurality of sealed dose<br>
containers (e.g. containing the dry powder composition) mounted longitudinally in a strip<br>
or ribbon inside a suitable inhalation device. The container is rupturable or pee1-openable<br>
on demand and the dose, e.g. of the dry powder composition, can be administered by<br>

The DisKUS ™ inhalation device is usually substantially as described in GB 2,242,134<br>
A, and in such device at least one container for the pharmaceutical composition in<br>
powder form (the at least one container preferably being a plurality of sealed dose<br>
containers mounted longitudinally in a strip or ribbon) is defined between two members<br>
peelably secured to one another; the device comprises: means defining an opening station<br>
for the said at least one container; means for peeling the members apart at the opening<br>

through which a user can inhale the pharmaceutical composition in powder form from the<br>
opened container.<br>

individual compounds of the combination, and the composition being incorporated into a<br>
plurality of sealed dose containers mounted longitudinally in a strip or ribbon inside the<br>
inhalation device, the containers being rupturable or pee1-openable on demand; for<br>

Inhibition of PDE 3, PDE 4B, PDE 4D, PDE 5 or PDE 6 activity: radioactive<br>
Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA)<br><br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit catalytic activity at PDE4B or 4D (human<br>
recombinant), PDE3 (from bovine aorta) or PDE5 (human recombinant) or PDE6 (from<br>
bovine retina) was determined by Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) in 96-well format.<br>
Test compounds (preferably as a solution in DMSO, e.g. about 2 microlitre (ul) volume<br>
of DMSO solution) were preincubated at ambient temperature (room temperature, e.g.<br>
19-23°C) in Wallac isoplates (code 1450-514) with PDE enzyme in 50mM Tris-HCl<br>
buffer pH 7.5 , 8.3mM MgCl2,1.7mM EGTA, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 10-<br>
30 minutes (usually 30 minutes). The enzyme concentration was adjusted so that no<br>
more than 20% hydrolysis of the substrate defined below occurred in control wells<br>
without compound, during the incubation. For PDE3, PDE4B and PDE4D assays, [5',8-<br>
3H]Adenosine 3\5'-cyclic phosphate ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, code TRK.559; or<br>
Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd, Pollards Wood, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire<br>
HP8 4SP, UK) was added to give 0.05uCi per well and ~ lOnM final concentration. For<br>
thePDE5 and PDE6 assay [8-3H]Guanosine 3',5'-cyclicphosphate ( Amersham<br>
Phannacia Biotech , code TRK.392) was added to give 0.05uCi per well and ~ 36nM<br>
final concentration. Plates, preferably containing approx. 100 ul volume of assay<br>
mixture, were mixed on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes and incubated at ambient<br>
temperature for 1 hour. Phosphodiesterase SPA beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,<br>
code PvPNQ 0150) were added (~lmg per well) to terminate the assay. Plates were sealed<br>
and shaken and allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 35 minutes to 1 hour<br>
(preferably 35 minutes) to allow the beads to settle. Bound radioactive product was<br>
measured using a WALLAC TRILUX 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter. For<br>
inhibition curves, 10 concentrations (1.5-M - 30uM) of each compound were assayed.<br>
Curves were analysed using ActivityBase and XLfit (ID Businesss Solutions Limited, 2<br>
Ocean Court, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7QB, United Kindgom)<br>
Results were expressed as pICso values.<br>
In an alternative to the above radioactive SPA assay, PDE4B or PDE4D inhibition can be<br>
measured in the following Fluorescence Polarisation (FP) assay:<br>
Inhibition ofPDE4B or PDE4D activity: Fluorescence Polarisation (FP) assay<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit catalytic activity at PDE4B (human<br>
recombinant) or PDE4D (human recombinant) was determined by IMAP Fluorescence<br>
Polarisation (FP) assay (MAP Explorer kit, available from Molecular Devices<br>
Corporation, Sunnydale, CA, USA; Molecular Devices code: R8062) in 384-well format.<br>
The MAP FP assay is able to measure PDE activity in an homogenous, non-radioactive<br>
assay format. The FP assay uses the ability of immobilised trivalent metal cations, coated<br>
onto nanoparticles (tiny beads), to bind the phosphate group of F1-AMP that is produced<br>
on the hydrolysis of fluorescein-labelled (Fl) cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate<br>
(F1-cAMP) to the non-cyclic F1-AMP form. F1-cAMP does not bind. Binding of F1-AMP<br>
product to the beads (coated with the immobilised trivalent cations) slows the rotation of<br>
the bound F1-AMP and leads to an increase in the fluorescence polarisation ratio of<br>
parallel to perpendicular light. Inhibition of the PDE reduces/inhibits this signal increase.<br><br>
Test compounds (small volume, e.g. ca. 0.5 to 1 ul, preferably ca. 0.5 ul, of<br>
solution in DMSO) were preincubated at ambient temperature (room temperature, e.g. 19-<br>
23°C) in black 384-well microtitre plates (supplier: NUNC, code 262260) with PDE<br>
enzyme in lOmM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.2, 10mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum<br>
albumin, and 0.05% NaN3 for 10-30 minutes. The enzyme level was set by<br>
experimentation so that reaction was linear throughout the incubation. Fluorescein<br>
adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (from Molecular Devices Corporation, Molecular<br>
Devices code: R7091) was added to give about 40nM final concentration (final assay<br>
volume usually ca. 20-40 ul, preferably ca. 20 ul). Plates were mixed on an orbital shaker<br>
for 10 seconds and incubated at ambient temperature for 40 minutes. IMAP binding<br>
reagent (as described above, from Molecular Devices Corporation, Molecular Devices<br>
code: R7207) was added (60ul of a 1 in 400 dilution in binding buffer of the kit stock<br>
solution) to terminate the assay. Plates were allowed to stand at ambient temperature for<br>
1 hour. The Fluorescence Polarisation (FP) ratio of parallel to perpendicular light was<br>
measured using an Analyst^M plate reader (from Molecular Devices Corporation). For<br>
inhibition curves, 10 concentrations (1.5nM - 30uM) of each compound were assayed.<br>
Curves were analysed using ActivityBase and XLfit (ID Businesss Solutions Limited, 2<br>
Ocean Court, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7QB, United Kindgom).<br>
Results were expressed as pICso values.<br>
In the FP assay, all reagents were dispensed using MultidropTM (available from<br>
Thermo Labsystems Oy, Ratastie 2, PO Box 100, Vantaa 01620, Finland).<br>
For a given PDE4 inhibitor, the PDE4B (or PDE4D) inhibition values measured using the<br>
SPA and FP assays can differ slightly. However, in a regression analysis of 100 test<br>
compounds, the PIC50 inhibition values measured using SPA and FP assays have been<br>
found generally to agree within 0.5 log units, for PDE4B and PDE4D (linear regression<br>
coefficient 0.966 for PDE4B and 0.971 for PDE4D; David R.Mobbs et al., "Comparison<br>
of the IMAP Fluorescence Polarisation Assay with the Scintillation Proximity Assay for<br>
Phosphodiesterase Activity", poster to be presented at 2003 Molecular Devices UK &amp;<br>
Europe User Meeting, 2nd October 2003, Down Hall, Harlow, Essex, United Kingdom).<br>
Biological Data obtained for some of the Examples (PDE4B inhibitory activity, either as<br>
one reading or as an average of ca. 2-6 readings) are as follows, based on current<br>
measurements only. In each of the SPA and FP assays, absolute accuracy of<br>
measurement is not possible, and the readings given are accurate only up to about ± 0.5 of<br>
a log unit, depending on the number of readings made and averaged:<br><br><br><br>
Many, but not all, of the Examples have been tested for PDE4B inhibition. Of the<br>
Examples tested for PDE4B inhibition, some were tested by the radioactive SPA assay,<br>
some were tested by the FP assay.<br>
Most or substantially all of Examples 1-45, 47-55, 57-81, 83 and 84 have PDE4B<br>
inhibitory activities in the range of pICso = about 6 (± about 0.5) to about 9.1 (± 0.5).<br>
The Examples wherein B? = cyclohexyl (NHR.3 or NR3R3a = sub-formula (c)),<br>
tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl (NHR3 or NR3R3a = group (h)), or certain other types of<br>
substituted cyclohexyl or certain heterocycles, or Examples wherein NHR3 or NR3R3a =<br>
sub-formula (s), usually or often (based on data for R1 = ethyl) have a higher level of<br>
selectivity for PDE4B over PDE5, as measured in the above enzyme inhibition assays,<br>
compared to the selectivities of comparable Examples wherein R^ = cyclopropyl (NHR3<br>
or NR3R3a = sub-formula (b)).<br>
Emesis:	Some known PDE4 inhibitors can cause emesis and/or nausea to greater or<br>
lesser extents (e.g. see Z. Huang et al., Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, 2001, 5:<br>
432-438, see especially pages 433-434 and refs cited therein). Therefore, it would be<br>
preferable, but not essential, if a particular PDE4 inhibitory compound or salt of the<br>
invention were to cause only limited or manageable emetic side-effects. Emetic side-<br>
effects can for example be measured by the emetogenic potential of the compound or salt<br>
when administered to ferrets; for example one can measure the time to onset, extent,<br>
frequency and/or duration of vomiting, retching and/or writhing in ferrets after oral or<br>
parenteral administration of the compound or salt. See for example In vivo Assay 4<br>
hereinafter for a measurement method for anti-inflammatory effect, emetic side-effects<br>
and therapeutic index (TI) in the ferret. See also for example A. Robichaud et al.,<br>
"Emesis induced by inhibitors of [PDEIV] in the ferret", Neuropharmacology, 1999,38,<br>
289-297, erratum Neuropharmacology, 2001, 40,465-465. However, optionally, emetic<br>
side-effects and therapeutic index (TI) in rats can be conveniently measured by<br>
monitoring the pica feeding behaviour of rats after administration of the compound or salt<br>
of the invention (see In Vivo Assay 2 below).<br><br>
Other side effects: Some known PDE4 inhibitors can cause other side effects such as<br>
headache and other central nervous sytem (CNS-) mediated side effects; and/or<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract disturbances. Therefore, it would be preferable but not<br>
essential if a particular PDE4 inhibitory compound or salt of the invention were to cause<br>
only limited or manageable side-effects in one or more of these side-effect categories.<br>
In Vivo Biological Assays<br>
The in vitro enzymatic PDE4B inhibition assay described above should be regarded as<br>
being the primary test of biological activity. However, additional in vivo biological tests,<br>
which are optional and which are not an essential measure of efficacy or side-effects, are<br>
described below.<br>
In Vivo Assay 1. LPS-induced pulmonary neutrophilia in rats: effect of orally<br>
administeredPDE4 inhibitors<br>
Pulmonary neutrophil influx has been shown to be a significant component to the<br>
family of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which<br>
can involve chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema (G.F. Filley, Chest. 2000; 117(5);<br>
251s-260s). The purpose of this neutrophilia model is to study the potentially anti-<br>
inflammatory effects in vivo of orally administered PDE4 inhibitors on neutrophilia<br>
induced by inhalation of aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS), modelling the neutrophil<br>
inflammatory components) of COPD. See the literature section below for scientific<br>
background.<br>
Male Lewis rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) weighing approximately 300-<br>
400 grams are pretreated with either (a) test compound suspended in 0.5%<br>
methylcellulose (obtainable from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in water or (b)<br>
vehicle only, delivered orally in a dose volume of 10 ml/kg. Generally, dose response<br>
curves are generated using the following doses of PDE4 inhibitors: 10.0, 2.0, 0.4, 0.08<br>
and 0.016 mg/kg. Thirty minutes following pretreatment, the rats are exposed to<br>
aerosolized LPS (Serotype E. Coli 026:B6 prepared by trichloroacetic acid extraction,<br>
obtainable from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), generated from a nebulizer<br>
containing a 100 jj.g/ml LPS solution. Rats are exposed to the LPS aerosol at a rate of 4<br>
L/min for 20 minutes. LPS exposure is carried out in a closed chamber with internal<br>
dimensions of 45 cm length x 24 cm width x 20 cm height. The nebulizer and exposure<br>
chamber are contained in a certified fume hood. At 4 hours-post LPS exposure the rats<br>
are euthanized by overdose with pentobarbital at 90 mg/kg, administered<br>
intraperitoneally. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed through a 14 gauge blunt<br>
needle into the exposed trachea. Five, 5 ml washes are performed to collect a total of 25<br>
ml of BAL fluid. Total cell counts and leukocyte differentials are performed on BAL<br>
fluid in order to calculate neutrophil influx into the lung. Percent neutrophil inhibition at<br>
each dose (cf. vehicle) is calculated and a variable slope, sigmoidal dose-response curve<br>
is generated, usually using Prism Graph-Pad. The dose-response curve is used to<br>
calculate an ED50 value (in mg per kg of body weight) for inhibition by the PDE4<br>
inhibitor of the LPS-induced neutrophilia.<br><br>
Results: Based on current measurements, the compounds of Examples 14,17,23,<br>
35 and 38, administered orally in the above procedure, exhibited neutrophilia-inhibition<br>
ED50 values in the range of about 0.03 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, subject to testing<br>
inaccuracies.<br>
Alternative method and results: In an alternative embodiment of the procedure, a<br>
single oral dose of 10 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of the PDE4 inhibitor (or vehicle) is<br>
administered to the rats, and percent neutrophil inhibition is calculated and reported for<br>
that specific dose. In this embodiment, based on current measurements, the compounds<br>
of Examples 2,14, 23 and 38, administered orally in this alternative procedure at a single<br>
dose of 10 mg/kg, exhibited percent neutrophilia-inhibition in the range of about 74% to<br>
about 86%, subject to testing inaccuracies.<br>

In Vivo Assay 2. Rat Pica Model ofemesis<br>
Background: Selective PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to inhibit inflammation<br>
in various in vitro and in vivo models by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP of many<br>
immune cells (e.g. lymphocytes, monocytes). However, a side effect of some PDE4<br>
inhibitors in many species is emesis. Because many rat models of inflammation are well<br>
characterized, they have been used in procedures (see e.g. In Vivo Assay 1 above) to<br>
show beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of PDE 4 inhibitors. However rats have no<br>
emetic response (they have no vomit reflex), so that the relationship between beneficial<br>
anti-inflammatory effects of PDE 4 inhibitors and emesis is difficult to study directly in<br>
rats.<br>
However, in 1991, Takeda et al. (see Literature section below) demonstrated that<br>
the pica feeding response is analogous to emesis in rats. Pica feeding is a behavioural<br>
response to illness in rats wherein rats eat non-nutritive substances such as earth or in<br>
particular clay (e.g. kaolin) which may help to absorb toxins. Pica feeding can be<br>
induced by motion and chemicals (especially chemicals which are emetic in humans), and<br>
can be inhibited pharmacologically with drugs that inhibit emesis in humans. The Rat<br>
Pica Model, In Vivo Assay 2, can determine the level of pica response of rats to PDE 4<br>
inhibition at pharmacologically relevant doses in parallel to in vivo anti-inflammatory<br>
Assays in (a separate set of) rats (e.g. In Vivo Assay 1 above). Anti-inflammatory and<br>
pica assays in the same species together can provide data on the "therapeutic index" (TI)<br>
in the rat of the compounds/salts of the invention. The Rat TI can for example be<br><br>
calculated as the ratio of a) the potentially-emetic Pica Response ED50 dose from Assay<br>
2 to b) the rat anti-infiammatory ED50 dose (e.g. measured by rat neutrophilia-inhibition<br>
in eg In Vivo Assay 1), with larger TI ratios possibly indicating lower emesis at many<br>
anti-inflammatory doses. This might allow a choice of a non-emetic or minima1-emetic<br>
pharmaceutical dose of the compounds or salts of the invention which has an<br>
anti-inflammatory effect. It is recognised however that achieving a low-emetic PDE4<br>
inhibitory compound is not essential to the invention.<br>
Procedure: On the first day of the experiment, the rats are housed individually<br>
in cages without bedding or "enrichment". The rats are kept off of the cage floor by a<br>
wire screen. Pre-weighed food cups containing standard rat chow and clay pellets are<br>
placed in the cage. The clay pellets, obtainable from Languna Clay Co, City of Industry,<br>
CA, USA, are the same size and shape as the food pellets. The rats are acclimated to the<br>
clay for 72 hours, during which time the cups and food and clay debris from the cage are<br>
weighed daily on an electronic balance capable of measuring to the nearest 0.1 grams. By<br>
the end of the 72 hour acclimation period the rats generally show no interest in the clay<br>
pellets.<br>
At the end of 72 hours the rats are placed in clean cages and the food cups<br>
weighed. Rats that are still consuming clay regularly are removed from the study.<br>
Immediately prior to the dark cycle (the time when the animals are active and should be<br>
eating) the animals are split into treatment groups and dosed orally with a dose of the<br>
compound/salt of the invention (different doses for different treatment groups) or with<br>
vehicle alone, at a dose volume of 2 ml/kg. In this oral dosing, the compound/salt is in<br>
the form of a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose (obtainable Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,<br>
MO, USA) in water. The food and clay cups and cage debris are weighed the following<br>
day and the total clay and food consumed that night by each individual animal is<br>
calculated.<br>
A dose response is calculated by first converting the data into quantal response,<br>
where animals are either positive or negative for the pica response. A rat is "pica<br>
positive" if it consumes greater than or equal to 0.3 grams of clay over the mean of is<br>
usually calculated using logistic regression performed by the Statistica software statistical<br>
package. A Pica Response ED50 value in mg per kg of body weight can then be<br>
calculated.<br>
The Pica Response ED50 value can be compared to the neutrophilia-inhibition<br>
ED50 values for the same compound administered orally to the rat (measurable by In<br>
Vivo Assay 1 above), so that a Therapeutic Index (TI) in rats can be calculated thus:<br><br>
In general, the Therapeutic Index (TI) calculated this way is often substantially<br>
different to, for example can often be substantially higher than, the TI (D20/D50)<br>
calculated in the ferret (see In vivo Assay 4 below).<br>
Results: Using the above procedure, and according to current measurements, the<br>
compounds of Examples 14,17, 23, 35 and 38 exhibited a Pica Response ED50 in the<br>
range of about 2 mg/kg to greater than about 50 mg/kg, subject to testing inaccuracies.<br>
Taking the specific Pica Response ED50 values for these compounds together with the<br>
specific rat neutrophilia-inhibition ED50 values measured in In Vivo Assay 1 for<br>
Examples 14,17,23,35 and 38, the Rat Therapeutic Index (TI) for orally-administered<br><br>
Examples 14,17,23,35 and 38 was calculated using the above equation as being in the<br>
range of from about 12 to about 470, according to current measurements, subject to<br>
testing inaccuracies.<br>

In Vivo Assay 3. LPS induced pulmonary neutrophilia in rats: effect of<br>
intratracheally administered PDE4 inhibitors<br>
This assay is an animal model of inflammation in the lung - specifically<br>
neutrophilia induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - and allows the study of putative<br>
inhibition of such neutrophilia (anti-inflammatory effect) by intratracheally (i.t.)<br>
administered PDE4 inhibitors. The PDE4 inhibitors are preferably in dry powder or wet<br>
suspension form. It. administration is one model of inhaled administration, allowing<br>
topical delivery to the lung.<br>
Animals: Male CD (Sprague Dawley Derived) rats supplied by Charles River,<br>
Raleigh, NC, USA are housed in groups of 5 rats per cage, acclimatised after delivery for<br>
at least 7 days with bedding/nesting material regularly changed, fed on SDS diet Rl<br>
pelleted food given ad lib, and supplied with daily-changed pasteurised animal grade<br>
drinking water.<br>
Device for dry powder administration: Disposable 3-way tap between dosing<br>
needle and syringe. A 3-way sterile tap (Vycon Ref 876.00) is weighed, the drug blend<br>
or inhalation grade lactose (vehicle control) is then added to the tap, the tap closed to<br>
prevent loss of drug, and the tap is re-weighed to determine the weight of drug in the tap.<br>
After dosing, the tap is weighed again to determine the weight of drug that had left the<br>
tap. The needle, a Sigma Z21934-7 syringe needle 19-gauge 152 mm (6 inches) long<br>
with luer hub, is cut by engineering to approximately 132 mm (5.2 inches), a blunt end is<br><br>
made to prevent them damaging the rat's trachea, and the needle is weighed prior to and<br>
after drug delivery to confirm that no drug is retained in the needles after dosing.<br>
Device for wet suspension administration: This is the similar to'the above but a<br>
blunt dosing needle, whose forward end is slightly angled to the needle axis, is used,<br>
with a flexible plastic portex canula inserted into the needle.<br>
Drugs and Materials: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Serotype:0127:B8) (L3129 Lot<br>
61K4075) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PDE4 inhibitors are used in<br>
size-reduced (e.g. micronised) form, for example according to the Micronisation Example<br>
given above. For dry powder administration of the drug, the Dry Powder Formulation<br>
Example given above, comprising drug and inhalation-grade lactose, can be used. The<br>
inhalation-grade lactose usually used (Lot E98L4675 Batch 845120) has 10% fines (10%<br>
of material under 15um particle size measured by Malvern particle size).<br>
Wet suspensions of the drug can be prepared by added the required volume of<br>
vehicle to the drug, the vehicle being used being a mixture of saline/tween (0.2% tween<br>
80). The wet suspension was sonicated for 10 minutes prior to use.<br>
Preparation, and dosing with PDE 4 inhibitor: Rats are anaesthetised by placing<br>
the animals in a sealed Perspex chamber and exposing them to a gaseous mixture of<br>
isoflourane (4.5 %), nitrous oxide (3 htres.minute"1) and oxygen (1 litre.minute"1). Once<br>
anaesthetised, the animals are placed onto a stainless steel i.t. dosing support table. They<br>
are positioned on their back at approximately a 35° angle. A light is angled against the<br>
outside of the throat to highlight the trachea. The mouth is opened and the opening of the<br>
upper airway visualised. The procedure varies for wet suspension and dry powder<br>
administration of PDE4 inhibitors as follows:<br>
Dosing with a Wet suspension: A portex cannula is introduced via a blunt metal<br>
dosing needle that had been carefully inserted into the rat trachea. The animals are<br>
intratracheally dosed with vehicle or PDE4 inhibitor via the dosing needle with a new<br>
internal canula used for each different drug group. The formulation is slowly (10<br>
seconds) dosed into the trachea using a syringe attached to the dosing needle.<br>
Dosing with a Dry Powder: The three-way tap device and needle are inserted into<br>
the rat trachea up to a pre-determined point established to be located approximately 1 cm<br>
above the primary bifurcation. Another operator holds the needle at the specified position<br>
whilst 2 x 4ml of air is delivered through the three-way tap by depressing the syringes<br>
(ideally coinciding with the animal inspiring), aiming to expel the entire drug quantity<br>
from the tap. After dosing, the needle and tap are removed from the airway and the tap is<br>
closed off to prevent any retained drug leaving the tap.<br>
After dosing with either wet suspension or dry powder, the animals are then removed<br>
from the table and observed constantly until they have recovered from the effects of<br>
anaesthesia. The animals are returned to the holding cages and given free access to food<br>
and water; they are observed and any unusual behavioural changes noted.<br>
Exposure to LPS: About 2 hours after i.t. dosing with vehicle control or the PDE4<br>
inhibitor, the rats are placed into sealed Perspex containers and exposed to an aerosol of<br>
LPS (nebuliser concentration 150 ug.mr1) for 15 minutes. Aerosols of LPS are generated<br>
by a nebuliser (DeVilbiss, USA) and this is directed into the Perspex exposure chamber.<br><br>
Following the 15-minute LPS-exposure period, the animals are returned to the holding<br>
cages and allowed free access to both food and water.<br>
[In an alternative embodiment, the rats can exposed to LPS less than 2 hours after<br>
i.t. dosing. In another alternative embodiment, the rats can exposed to LPS more than 2<br>
hours (e.g. ca. 4 or ca. 6 hours) after i.t. dosing by vehicle or PDE4 inhibitor, to test<br>
whether or not the PDE4 inhibitor has a long duration of action (which is not essential).]<br>
Bronchoalveolar lavage: 4 hours after LPS exposure the animals are killed by<br>
overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (i.p.). The trachea is cannulated with polypropylene<br>
tubing and the lungs lavaged (washed out) with 3 x 5 mis of heparinised (25 units-ml-1)<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Neutrophil cell counts: The Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples are<br>
centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 7 minutes. The supernatant is removed and the resulting cell<br>
pellet resuspended in 1 ml PBS. A cell slide of the resuspension fluid is prepared by<br>
placing 100µl of resuspended BAL fluid into cytospin holders and then spun at 5000 rpm<br>
for 5 minutes. The slides are allowed to air dry and then stained with Leishmans stain (20<br>
minutes) to allow differential cell counting. The total cells are also counted from the<br>
resuspension. From these two counts, the total numbers of neutrophils in the BAL are<br>
determined. For a measure of PDE4-inhibitor-induced inhibition of neutrophilia, a<br>
comparison of the neutrophil count in rats treated with vehicle and rats treated with PDE4<br>
inhibitors is conducted.<br>
By varying the dose of the PDE4 inhibitor used in the dosing step (e.g. 0.2 or 0.1<br>
mg of PDE4 inhibitor per kg of body weight, down to e.g. 0.01 mg/kg), a dose-response<br>
curve can be generated.<br>
In vivo Assay 4.	Evaluation of Therapeutic Index of Orally-administered PDE 4<br>
inhibitors in the conscious ferret<br>
1.1	Materials<br>
The following materials are used for these studies:<br>
PDE4 inhibitors are prepared for oral (p.o.) administration by dissolving in a fixed<br>
volume (1 ml) of acetone and then adding cremophor to 20% of the final volume.<br>
Acetone is evaporated by directing a flow of nitrogen gas onto the solution. Once the<br>
acetone is removed, the solution is made up to final volume with distilled water.<br>
LPS is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline.<br>
1.2	Animals<br>
Male ferrets (Mustela Pulorius Furo, weighing 1 - 2 kg) are transported and allowed to<br>
acclimatise for not less than 7 days. The diet comprises SDS diet C pelleted food given<br>
ad lib with Whiskers™ cat food given 3 times per week. The animals are supplied with<br>
pasteurised animal grade drinking water changed daily.<br>
1.3	Experimental Protocol(s)<br>
1.3.1 Dosing with PDE4 inhibitors<br>
PDE4 inhibitors are administered orally (p.o.), using a dose volume of lml/kg.<br><br>
Ferrets are fasted overnight but allowed free access to water. The animals are orally<br>
dosed with vehicle or PDE 4 inhibitor using a 15cm dosing needle that is passed down the<br>
back of the throat into the oesophagus. After dosing, the animals are returned to holding<br>
cages fitted with perspex doors to allow observation, and given free access to water. The<br>
animals are constantly observed and any emetic episodes (retching and vomiting) or<br>
behavioural changes axe recorded. The animals are allowed access to food 60 - 90<br>
minutes after p.o. dosing.<br>
1.3.2	Exposure to LPS<br>
Thirty minutes after oral dosing with compound or vehicle control, the ferrets are placed<br>
into sealed perspex containers and exposed to an aerosol of LPS (30 µg/ml) for 10<br>
minutes. Aerosols of LPS are generated by a nebuliser (DeVilbiss, USA) and this is<br>
directed into the perspex exposure chamber. Following a 10-minute exposure period, the<br>
animals are returned to the holding cages and allowed free access to water, and at a later<br>
stage, food. General observation of the animals continues for a period of at least 2.5<br>
hours post oral dosing. All emetic episodes and behavioural changes are recorded.<br>
1.3.3	Bronchoalveolar lavage and cell counts<br>
Six hours after LPS exposure the animals are killed by overdose of sodium<br>
pentobarbitone administered intraperitoneally. The trachea is then cannulated with<br>
polypropylene tubing and the lungs lavaged twice with 20 ml heparinised (10 units/ml)<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples are<br>
centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 7 minutes. The supernatant is removed and the resulting cell<br>
pellet re-suspended in 1 ml PBS. A cell smear of re-suspended fluid is prepared and<br>
stained with Leishmans stain to allow differential cell counting. A total cell count is<br>
made using the remaining re-suspended sample. From this, the total number of<br>
neutrophils in the BAL sample is determined.<br>
1.3.4	Pharmacodynamic readouts<br>
The following parameters are recorded:<br>
a)	% inhibition of UPS-induced pulmonary neutrophilia to determine the dose of PDE4<br>
inhibitor which gives 50% inhibition (D50).<br>
b)	Emetic episodes - the number of vomits and retches are counted to determine the dose<br>
of PDE4 inhibitor that gives a 20% incidence of emesis (D20).<br>
c)	A therapeutic index (TI), using this assay, is then calculated for each PDE4 inhibitor<br>
using the following equation:<br><br>
It is noted that the Ferret Therapeutic index (TI) (D20/D50) calculated using this in vivo<br>
Assay 4 is often substantially different to, and for example is often substantially lower<br>
than, the Rat TI (50/50) calculated using the rat oral inflammation and pica feeding<br>
Assays 1+2.<br>
The calculation of TI using the known PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast in this Assay 4 is:<br><br>
D20 for emesis = 0.46 mg/kg p.o., D50 for ferret neutroplilia = 0.42 mg/kg p.o., Ferret<br>
TI=1.1.<br>
