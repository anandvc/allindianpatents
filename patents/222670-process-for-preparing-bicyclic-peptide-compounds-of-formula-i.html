Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of bicyclic peptide compounds of formula (I) hereinafter reported, useful as intermediates in the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds, and in particular in the preparation of bicyclic glycopeptides of formula (l-A) hereinafter reported, which possess antagonist activity of the tachykinin NK2 receptor. State of the art<br>
Compounds of formula (l-A) and in particular the compound [N-4-(2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-p-D-glucopyranosyl)-L-asparaginyl-L-a-aspartyl-L-triptophyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl-L-leucyl]-C-4,2-N-3,5-lactam-C-1,6-N-2,1-lactam (compound of formula (l-A) hereinafter reported, in which P^ = R2 = R3 = H, known with the trade name "Nepadutant") are compounds having a strong antagonist activity of the tachykinin NK2 receptor, and can therefore be used for preparing pharmaceutical compounds for treating diseases, useful in the treatment and prevention of diseases where tachykinins are implicated as neuromodulators.<br>
This compound and some of its intermediates are described in the European Patent No. 815 126 B1, particularly in Example 4. This document describes, on pages 4 and 5, the methods, already known in the literature, of synthesis in solution or in solid phase of linear peptides by sequential coupling of suitably protected amino acids and their subsequent final cyclization, in order to obtain compounds of general formula (I).<br>
These methods have been described in a very general way, while more details have been provided for preparing the compounds in Examples 1 and 2. In these examples, the synthesis used was the coupling of Fmoc amino acids in solid phase until a linear peptide was obtained which, after detachment from the resin, is cyclized, purified by HPLC and cyclized again. It is important to note that, following to this path of synthesis, the glycosidic pendant is introduced at the stage of synthesis in solid phase of the linear peptide on the resin, as a side chain suitably protected of Asparagine. Summary of the invention<br><br>
The Applicant has now surprisingly found a new and more efficient process for the preparation of bicyclic peptide compounds of formula (I) hereinafter reported, useful as intermediates for preparing compounds with pharmacological activity. The new process is carried out entirely in solution rather than in solid phase and allows products with high purity and high yields to be obtained. It is therefore subject of the present invention a process for the preparation of bicyclic peptide compounds of formula (I) (SEQ. ID. 1)<br><br>
wherein Ai and A2 are two nitrogen protecting groups different from each other,<br>
and R5 and R6, different from each other, are chosen from benzy|oxy and lower<br>
alkyloxy groups in which the alkyl part comprises a linear; or branched C1-C4<br>
group;<br>
2) intramolecular cyclisation of the compound of formula (III) coming from step 1)<br><br>
in .the presence of a solvent and of a suitable coupling agent to give the compound of formula (IV) (SEQ. ID. 3):<br><br>
wherein R5 is as defined above;<br>
3) deprotection of the compound of formula (IV) coming from step 2) in the<br>
presence of a solvent to give the compound of formula (V)<br><br>
wherein R5 is as defined above;<br><br>
4)	coupling between the compound of formula (V) coming from step 3) and a<br>
protected amino-acid of formula (Via) in the presence of a solvent, to give<br>
compounds of formula (VII) (SEQ. ID. 4):<br><br>
wherein A3 is a nitrogen protecting group; R7 is chosen from benzyloxy and lower alkyloxy groups, in which the alky! part comprises a linear or branched C1-C4 group; R$ is a residual group deriving from an activation procedure on the carboxyl group;<br>
5)	deprotection of the compound of formula (VII) coming from step 4) in the<br>
presence of a solvent to give a compound of formula (VIII)<br><br>
wherein R7 is as defined above;<br>
6)	intramolecular cyclisation, in the presence of a solvent and of a suitable<br>
coupling agent, of the compound of formula (VIII) coming from step 5) to give a<br><br><br>
wherein R7 is as defined above.<br>
Compound of formula (III) is represented by SEQ. ID. 2 wherein<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used for example for the preparation of<br>
bicyclic glycopeptide compounds of formula (l-A) hereinafter reported,  which<br>
possess a powerful antagonist activity towards the tachykinin NK2 receptor; the<br>
Applicant has found a new preparation process, whereby a glycosidic pendant is<br>
introduced into compounds of formula (I) by a reaction carried out in solution, and<br>
the purification of the final product by HPLC is not necessary, so that large scale<br><br>
production of these compounds can be achieved at decidedly lower costs than those of the current production process.<br>
A further subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of bicyclic glycopeptide compounds of formula (l-A) (SEQ. ID. 5)<br><br>
wherein Ri, R2 and R3, equal or different from each other, can be hydrogen or an oxygen protecting group, comprising the following steps:<br>
1A) activation of bicyclic peptide compounds of formula (I) with a suitable coupling agent to obtain a derivative of formula (ll-A)<br><br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of benzotriazole,  possibly substituted with a halogen, azabenzotriazole and succinimidyl; 2A) reaction of the compound of formula (ll-A) coming from step 1A) in the presence of a solvent with a glycosidic derivative of formula (lll-A)<br><br><br>
wherein R, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined above.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for preparing the compound of<br>
formula (1-A) starting from the compounds of formula (II) and formula (III), passing<br>
via the formation of the compound of formula (I) as described in the two<br>
aforementioned processes.<br>
The processes of the invention, carried out entirely by means of reactions in<br>
solution rather than in solid phase, show unexpectedly high yields and do not<br>
require the use of HPLC purification  processes, thus  allowing a significant<br>
reduction of the production costs and enabling large scale preparation to be<br>
achieved.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The nitrogen protecting groups used in the present processes can be chosen from<br>
any of the protecting groups that can be used for peptide synthesis such as those<br>
repprtpH  in  M    Rnrfanskv   "P^nZ/Vte  Chemistry"   Snrinner \A=&gt;rlaa   1988 or in  J.<br><br>
Jones, "The Chemical Synthesis of Peptides", Clarendon Press. Oxford 1994.<br>
According to the invention, the nitrogen protecting groups are preferably selected<br>
from the group consisting of benzyloxycarbonyl and alkoxy carbonyl in which the<br>
alkyl part comprises a linear or branched C1-C4 group; more preferably they are<br>
chosen from t-butoxycarbonyl (Bcc) and benzyloxycarbonyl (Z).<br>
R8 is a residual group deriving from an activation procedure, preferably chosen<br>
from the group consisting of benzyloxycarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl comprising in the-<br>
alkyl part a linear or branched C1-C4 group, succinimidyl, benzotriazole possibly<br>
substituted by a halogen, and azabenzotriazole.<br>
The linear peptides of formula (II) can be prepared by one of the following<br>
strategies:<br>
a) Stepwise strategy: with this strategy the amino acids necessary for obtaining<br>
the peptide of formula (II) are sequentially coupled starting from a derivative of the<br>
amino acid Dpr of formula (X), protected on nitrogen and prepared separately or<br>
generated in situ<br>
wherein: <br>
A2 and A4, different from each other, are nitrogen protecting groups, as defined<br>
above;<br>
R9 is a residual group deriving from an activation procedure, preferably chosen<br>
from the group consisting of benzyloxycarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl comprising in the<br>
alkyl part a linear or branched C1-C4 group, and succinimidyl;<br>
the derivative of formula (X) above reported is reacted with a Leu ester (XI) in the<br>
presence of a solvent<br><br>
wherein R5 is defined as above,<br><br>
thus' obtaining the dipeptide A4-Dpr(A2)-Leu-R5, which is then deprotected by a<br>
suitable method depending on the protecting group on nitrogen to be removed,<br>
and compatible with the protecting group to be maintained.<br>
The dipeptide thus deprotected is subsequently coupled with the activated ester of<br>
the amino acid Phe, and so on in sequence with Trp and Asp until the compounds<br>
of formula (II) are obtained.<br>
b)- Strategy 2+2+1: this strategy consists of coupling the monodeprotected<br>
dipeptide H-Dpr(A2)-Leu-R5l obtained as described above according to strategy a),<br>
with an activated derivative of the dipeptide having the following formula (XII)<br>
A5-Trp-Phe-OH<br>
(XII) wherein A2 and A5, different from each other, are nitrogen protecting groups, as<br>
defined above;<br>
prepared separately or generated in situ by coupling an activated ester of a Trp<br>
protected on nitrogen prepared separately or generated in situ, with a Phe ester<br>
and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester group.<br>
The resulting tetrapeptide A5-Trp-Phe-Dpr(A2)-Leu-R5 is suitably deprotected from<br>
the group attached to the nitrogen of Trp and coupled with a compound of formula<br>
(Vlb)<br><br>
wherein<br>
A-i, Re and R8 are defined as above.<br>
c) Strategy 3+2: according to this strategy the tripeptide A:-Asp(R6)-Trp-Phe-OH,<br>
obtained by removing the nitrogen protecting group from the compounds of<br>
formula (XII) above reported, and subsequent coupling with a compound of<br>
formula (Vlb) above reported, is then coupled with the monodeprotected dipeptide<br><br>
H-ppr-(A2)-Leu-R5 prepared as described according to the procedure of strategy a).<br>
As used in the present invention, the term "lower alkoxyl groups" refers to those alkoxyl groups in which the alkyl part comprises a linear or branched C1-C4 group, preferably selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl and t-butyl. This should be meant also for the alkyloxycarbonyl groups of the invention, in which the alkyl part comprises a linear or branched C1-C4 group, preferably selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl and t-butyl.<br>
The coupling agent can be chosen from any one of those more commonly used in peptide synthesis, so as to generate an activated amino acid derivative such as those reported for example in M. Bodansky, "Peptide Chemistry", Springer Verlag 1988 or in J. Jones, "The Chemical Synthesis of Peptides", Clarendon Press. Oxford 1994.<br>
The activated derivatives, if not commercially available, can be prepared<br>
separately or in situ by reaction between an amino acid or a peptide and one or<br>
more of the numerous known coupling agents, such as isobutyl chloroformate<br>
(IBCF), a carbodiimide selected from dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-ethyl-<br>
3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC.HCI) possibly in<br>
combination with a hydroxyderivative selected from 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBt), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt), 6-chloro-1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(CI-HOBt) and hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu); a phosphonium salt, N-oxide<br>
guanidine salt or uronium salt, such as (Benzotriazol-1-<br>
yloxy)tri(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), (Benzotriazol-<br>
1-yloxy)tripyrrplidine phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 1-<br>
[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-benzotriazolium-3-oxide hexafluorophosphate<br>
(HBTU), 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-5-chloro-1H-benzotriazolium-3-oxide<br>
hexafluorophosphate	(HCTU),	1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-<br>
benzotriazolium-3-oxide	tetrafluoroborate	(TBTU),	1-<br>
[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazole[4,5-b]pyridinium-3-oxide<br>
hexafluorophosphate     (HATU),     1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-5-chloro-1 H-<br>
benzotriazolium-3-oxide	tetrafluoroborate	(TCTU),	O-<br><br>
[(ethoxycarbonyOcyanomethylenaminoj-N.N.N'.N'-tetramethyluronium<br>
tetrafluoroborate       (TOTU),        0-(bicycIo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximido)-<br>
N.N.N'.N'-tetramethyluronium  tetrafluoroborate  (TNTU),  or O-(N-succinimidyl)-<br>
N.N.N'.N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU).<br>
Where the derivative is generated in situ the coupling reaction is carried out<br>
immediately afterwards by adding the other reagent, which obviously, in the case<br>
of intramolecular cyclizations, corresponds to the free amine end present in the<br>
molecule itself.<br>
The coupling reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a tertiary amine<br>
such as N-methylmorpholine (NMM), triethylamine (TEA) or diisopropylethylamine<br>
(DIPEA) in an organic solvent chosen from those generally used for peptide<br>
synthesis. Preferred solvents for the coupling reaction are ethyl acetate (AcOEt),<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP).<br>
The coupling reactions can be carried out at a temperature that would not cause<br>
degradations or render the reaction too slow, the temperature being preferably<br>
comprised between -20 and +50°C.<br>
The deprotections in the processes of the  invention are achieved  by the<br>
appropriate methods for groups to be removed and compatible with the groups to<br>
be retained; generally the present deprotection reactions are carried out by means<br>
of catalytic hydrogenation or by acid or base treatments.<br>
For hydrogenations, the catalyst can be chosen from those varieties of catalysts<br>
which are available and suitable for this purpose; 5% or 10% Palladium are<br>
preferred. The solvent for the deprotection reactions by catalytic hydrogenation<br>
can be chosen from those that dissolve the compounds in reaction, excluding<br>
ketones such as acetone, the solvents which poison the catalyst and those that<br>
react with the components of the reaction themselves. DMF, NMP, organic acids<br>
such as acetic acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), and alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, or mixtures thereof, are the preferred reaction<br>
solvents. The hydrogenation reaction temperature is comprised between -20 and<br>
+50°C.<br>
For deprotections by acid treatment, mineral acids are preferably used, such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, or organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid,<br><br>
which can be used alone or mixed with other solvents. The temperature is<br>
between -20 and +50°C.<br>
For deprotections by basic treatment, hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline<br>
earth metals are preferably used in the presence of a solvent such as water,<br>
dioxane, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or mixtures thereof; the<br>
temperature is comprised between -20 and +50°C.<br>
The term "oxygen protecting group" as used in the present invention refers to a<br>
protecting group selected from those commonly used for the protection of -OH<br>
groups and well known to any person skilled in the art, selected for example from<br>
the group consisting of-COR4 wherein R4 is a linear or branched alkyl group, with<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the phenyl being possibly substituted by a halogen<br>
atom, benzyl or benzoyl; the oxygen protecting group is preferably acetyl.<br>
According to the invention the glycopeptide compounds of formula (l-A) can be<br>
obtained by reacting a glycosidic derivative of formula (IIl-A) with an activated<br>
peptide derivative of formula (ll-A), obtained by an activation reaction or generated<br>
in situ by a compound of formula (I). Therefore, in the preparation process of<br>
bicyclic glycopeptide  compounds  of formula  (1-A),  the  glycosidic  group  is<br>
introduced not in the linear peptide, but in the bicyclic peptide compound.<br>
If compounds of formula (lll-A) are reacted in which R1, R2 and R3 are not<br>
hydrogen, the compounds of formula (l-A) obtained can be transformed into the<br>
corresponding   compounds   in   which   Ri=R2=R3=H,   by   means   of   catalytic<br>
hydrogenation or by an acid or base treatment according to the nature of the<br>
protecting groups Ri, R2 and R3.<br>
The glycosidic compounds of formula (lll-A) preferably used in the process of the<br>
invention are selected from the group consisting of 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-(3-D-<br>
glucopyranosylamine	and	2-acetamide-3,4,6-tri-0-acetyl-2-deoxy-(3-D-<br>
glucopyranosylamine, which are known in the literature and can be prepared for<br>
example as described respectively in I. Shin et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 42 (2001)<br>
1325-1328 and D. Macmillan et al., Organic Letters, Vol. 4, Ns 9, 2002.<br>
The following examples and schemes of synthesis are given to provide a non-<br>
imiting illustration of the invention.<br>
Scheme 1 indicates the synthesis path which, starting from the compounds of<br><br>
formula (II) leads to those of formula (l-A), whereas schemes 2-4 show the three<br>
different strategies for preparing the compounds of formula (II).<br>
The protecting groups shown as examples are t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) for the amino extremities and methylester and t-butylester<br>
for the carboxyl extremities.<br>
The numbers given beside each compound in the following schemes corresponds<br>
to the numbers attributed to the compounds in the examples.<br>
The identification and evaluation of purity for the compounds prepared has been<br>
established by elemental analysis, HPLC, 1H-NMR, IR and mass analysis.<br>
