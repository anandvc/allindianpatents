The respective bolts 50 are inserted through the mounting portion 41a of the bracket 41 and the boss portions 40b of the interposedly held portion 40a, and threadedly fitted in the bridge member 16.<br><br>
[34]	<br>
The front half fender-member 39 is also formed so as to have a substantially U-shape in cross-section which is opened downward so as to cover the front wheel WF from above. At a center of a rear portion of the front half fender-member 39, a mounting plate portion 39a which stands upward is provided integrally and continuously as clearly shown in Fig. 8. At an upper end of the mounting plate portion 39a, a stopper plate portion 39b which is ascendingly inclined rearward is provided integrally and continuously. <br><br>
Moreover, in the mounting plate portion 3 9a, an insertion hole 51 is provided. In a continuously connecting portion of the mounting plate portion 39a and the stopper plate portion 39b, a rectangular stopper hole 52	is provided.<br><br>
[35]	<br>
On the other hand, at a front end of the mounting portion 41a in the bracket 41, a bulged portion 41c which rises up is provided integrally and continuously. At a center portion of a front end of this bulged portion 41c, a rising-up plate 41d, which abuts on the mounting plate portion 39a of the front half fender-member 39 from the rear, and a font end of which is inserted through and fitted in the stopper hole 52, is provided at a lower end thereof continuously and integrally. Furthermore, to a back surface of the rising-up plate portion 41d at a portion corresponding to the insertion hole 51, a weld nut 53 is fixed. A bolt 54 which is inserted through the insertion hole 51 from the front of the mounting plate portion 39a is threadedly fitted in the weld nut 53. That is, the upper portion of the rear side of the front half fender-member 39 is supported by the bracket 41.<br><br>
[36]	<br>
Incidentally, at tip end portions of the both stopper arms 43 in the bracket 41, supporting plate portions 43a, which extend in substantially parallel with both left and right inner surfaces of a rear portion which are located downward relative to the mounting plate portion 39a in the front half fender-member 39, are bendingly formed. On the other hand, at the front end portion of the front half fender-member 40, arm portions 40c, 40c which extend laterally from both sides of the bulged portion 41c in the bracket 41 are integrally and continuously provided. At tip ends of those arm portions 40c, the mounting plate portions 40d, which are interposed between the both sides of the rear portion of the front half fender-member 39, and the supporting plate portions 43a of the bracket 41, are integrally and continuously provided. To inner surfaces of the supporting plate portions 43a, weld nuts 55 are fixed. Screw members 56, which are inserted through the both sides of the rear portion of the front half fender-member 39 and the mounting plate portions 40d from the outside, are threadedly fitted in the weld nuts 55.<br><br>
[37]	<br>
That is, both left and right sides of the rear portion of the front half fender-member 39 and both left and right sides of the front portion of the rear half fender-member 40 are fastened to the bracket 41 by co-fastening by the screw members 56.<br><br>
[38]	<br>
Next, the operation of this working example will be explained. The front half fender-member 39 and the rear half fender-member 40 are detachably mounted to the bracket 41 which is the member formed separately from the front fork 17, and the bracket 41 to which the front half fender- member 39 and the rear half fender-member 40 are installed is detachably mounted to the undersurface of the bridge member 16 constituting a part of the front fork 17, so that it is possible to attempt improvement in operation efficiency for installation by mounting the bracket 41, the front half fender-member 39, and the rear half fender- member 40 to the bridge member 16 of the front fork 17 after sub-installation of the bracket 41, the front half fender-member 39 and the rear half fender-member 40. Moreover, at the time of maintenance, it is possible to carry out replacement of the front fender 38 by only removing the front wheel WF from the front fork 17, without .removing the front fork 17 from the motorcycle body F, and possible to increase maintenance efficiency. Moreover, if it is possible to fasten and release the bolts 50 by using a short tool or a special tool provided with a universal joint, it is possible to exchange the front fender 38 without removing the front wheel WF. <br><br>
[0039]<br>
Moreover, the bracket 41 which has the rear half fender- member 40 interposed between itself and the undersurface of the bridge member 16 is fastened, together with the rear half fender-member 40, to the bridge member 16 by the bolts, so that as compared with a case where the rear half fender- member 40 and the bracket 41 are separately mounted to the front fork, it is possible to reduce the number of the fastening members, reduce the number of parts, and reduce the number of man-hours for installation.<br><br>
[40]	<br>
Moreover, the rear half fender-member 40 is formed so as to have the interposedly held portion 40a, at the top portion thereof, which is interposed between the bracket 41 and the bridge member 16, and have a substantially U-shape in cross-section which is opened downward, and the bolts 50 are inserted through the bracket 41 and the interposedly held portion 40 from below the bracket 41, and threadedly fitted in the bridge member 16, so that the bolts 50 are hidden by the rear half fender-member 40 and are not exposed to the outer, thus making it possible to enhance appearance.<br><br>
[41]	<br>
Moreover, both the left and right sides of the rear portion of the front half fender-member 39 and both the left and right sides of the front portion of the rear half fender-member 40 are respectively fastened to the bracket 41 by the co-fastening by the screw members 56, so that the number of the screw members 56 can be reduced, the number of parts can be reduced and the number of man-hours for installation can be reduced as compared with a case where the front half fender-member 39 and the rear half fender- member 40 are separately fastened.<br><br>
[42]	<br>
Moreover, the rear half fender-member 40 is made of synthetic resin and the upper portion of the rear side and both the left and right sides of the rear portion located downward relative to the upper portion of the rear side of the metal-made front half fender-member 39 are supported by the bracket 41, so that a load is not exerted on the synthetic resin-made rear half fender-member 40, the strength of which is lowered as compared to metal, from the side of the front half fender-member 39 and the durability of the rear half fender-member 40 can be enhanced.<br><br>
[43]	<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate a reference example of the present invention. A front fender 61 includes a front half fender-member 62 and a rear half fender-member 63. The rear half fender-member 63 which is overlapped at a front portion of the rear half fender-member 63 on a rear portion of the front half fender-member 62 from below is fastened to both sides of the rear portion of the front half fender- member 62 by screw members 64, 64.<br><br>
[44]	<br>
Moreover, the rear portion of the front half fender- member 62 and the front portion of the rear half fender- member 63 remain overlapped each other and are detachably fastened to an undersurface of a bridge member 16 in a front fork 17 by a plurality of bolts 65, 65.<br><br>
[45]	<br>
According to this reference example, at the time of maintenance, it is possible to exchange the front fender 61 without removing the front fork 17 from a motorcycle body frame F, by only removing a front wheel WF from the front fork 17, and possible to enhance maintenance efficiency. If the bolts 65 can be fastened and loosened by using the short tool or the special tool described in connection with the working example, it is possible to remove and mount the front fender 61 without removing the front wheel WF.<br><br>
While the working example of the present invention has been explained, the present invention is not limited to the working example and various design variations may be made without departing from the present invention as set forth in the scope of Claims.<br><br>
[47]	<br>
For example, while the front fender structure for the motorcycle is described in connection with the working example, the present invention may be applied to a front fender structure for a three-wheeled vehicle. <br><br>
