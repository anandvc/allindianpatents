Apparatus for spinning and winding synthetic threads<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for spinning and winding synthetic threads according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In the melt spinning of synthetic threads, a plastic, preferably in the form of a granulate, is melted and is extruded through a spinning device into a multiplicity of straxLdlike filaments. In this case, temperatures of the order of 3 0 0 ° C are generated in the spinning device. To cool the freshly spun filaments and to avoid excessive heating, apparatuses of this type have cooling and air conditioning devices. Thus, it is known, for example from DE 42 23 198 Al, that, on the one hand, for cooling the filaments, the air conditioning device provides cooling air for the cooling device and, on the other hand, air-conditions the installation spaces in which the winding device is installed. For conditioning the surroundings of the apparatus, which normally extends over several storeys, very high-performance air conditioning devices are to be used for the air conditioning of the installation spaces. The known apparatus therefore has a high energy requirement. Furthermore, the installation space can be cooled to only a qualified extent, since the surroundings must always remain adapted to the operating personnel. Particularly in high-speed spinning methods, in which the threads are wound at a winding speed of &gt;4000 m, preferably &gt;6000 m, there is the additional problem that the threads are insufficiently cooled during winding. However, the bobbins generated by means of hot-wound threads are not dimensionally stable on account of incipient shrinkage phenomena in the thread which subsequently cools.<br>
DB 198 37 491 Al discloses an apparatus for the highspeed spinning and the winding of synthetic threads, in<br><br>
which a cooling air stream from an air conditioning device from the spinning device as far as a winding device is generated along the thread run. The cooling of the threads up to winding can consequently be improved. However, the cooling air stream generated along the entire spinning line has a direct adverse affect on the heat treatment of the thread interposed between the spinning device' and the winding device and on thread guidance . A further problem is due to the fact that the cooling air stream guided out of the spinning device along the spinning line heats up very sharply, even directly in the region of the spinning device, on account of the radiating heat, so that a cooling action can no longer be achieved in the region of the winding device.<br>
The object  of the invention, then, is to develop an apparatus for spinning and winding synthetic threads of the generic type, in such a way that the cooling of the threads and the winding of the threads take place in predetermined air-conditioned surroundings at as low an outlay as possible in energy terms.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide an apparatus for spinning and winding, in which the air-conditioned surroundings for winding the threads can be changed as a function of the process in a simple way.<br>
The solution is afforded by an apparatus having the features according to claim 1.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is distinguished in that the air conditioning necessary for thread production takes place only in the immediate surroundings of the thread.<br><br>
For this purpose, at least the winding components of the winding device by which the threads are wound into bobbins are arranged within an air conditioning chamber formed at the winding device. The air conditioning chamber is connected to the air conditioning device, so that an ambient condition required for winding the threads always prevails within the air conditioning chamber. The particular advantage of the invention is that installation in spaces which are not air-conditioned is possible. The air conditioning device assigned to the apparatus possesses a substantially lower power than the known air conditioning devices, thus leading to considerable energy savings. The direct access of the air conditioning device to the air conditioning chamber of the winding device allows an intensive cooling of the thread during winding, so that the apparatus according to the invention is suitable particularly for spinning and winding at high speeds.<br>
In order, on the one hand, to keep the influence of the immediate surroundings of the winding device away from the air conditioning chamber and, on the other hand, to allow a bobbin change at the winding device, the development of the invent ion i s part i cular ly advantageous in which the air conditioning chamber of the winding device has at least one closable bobbin orifice through which an extraction of the ready-wound bobbins can be carried out. A direct connection between the climate in the air conditioning chamber and the surroundings therefore occurs only during short change phases for the extraction of the ready-wound bobbins.<br>
The entry of the ambient air entrained by the threads can advantageously be reduced in that the air conditioning chamber of the winding device has at least one narrow thread orifice or a plurality of narrow thread orifices through which the threads can be fed individually or jointly to the winding components.<br><br>
The preferred design of the invention in which the air conditioning chamber has, for tie-up to the air-conditioning device, a feed orifice and a discharge orifice for guiding the cooling air ensures that the cooling air is continuously renewed within the air conditioning chamber and the heated cooling air is continuously discharged. In the phases in which no yarn is wound or in the phases in which a cooling air stream would impede thread guidance, for example in the event of a thread change, there is the possibility of closing the feed orifice of the air conditioning chamber. The shut-off of the feed orifice could also be utilized in order to vary the free opening cross section of the feed orifice for controlling or regulating the air quantity.<br>
The development of the invention in which the feed orifice of the air conditioning chamber is formed by the thread orifice to which a fall shaft of a cooling chamber of the cooling device is connected is particularly advantageous for processes in which undrafted partly oriented threads are produced without additional thermal treatment.<br>
For the positive guidance of the cooling air within the air conditioning chamber of the winding device, the discharge orifice is preferably connected to a suck-off appliance of the air conditioning device, so that the heated cooling air can be discharged continuously from the air conditioning chamber. In this case, too, the discharge orifice can preferably be designed so as to be closable, in order by partial closing to vary the discharged cooling air quantity or in order to prevent completely an extraction of the cooling air.<br>
In order to obtain a high integration of the air conditioning chamber within the winding device, the air<br><br>
conditioning chamber is formed partly from stand walls of a machine stand of the winding device. In this case, the air conditioning chamber is preferably connected fixedly to the machine stand, so that the winding device constitutes a complete unit which can be exchanged and transported in a simple way. Particularly with regard to the fact that a plurality of winding devices of this type are arranged next to one another in complete plants, a particularly narrow division can thereby achieved.<br>
The air conditioning chamber of the winding device comprises at least the winding components which are formed by a traversing device for the to-and-fro guidance of a plurality of threads running parallel, by a pressure roller for depositing the threads onto a bobbin and by a winding spindle for receiving the bobbins.<br>
For the simultaneous cooling of the drives and of the power electronics, the air conditioning chamber of the winding device can  also be configured  in such a way that the drive electronics, the control electronics and the drives are surrounded by the air conditioning chamber,<br>
For the production of, for example, fully drafted threads, the apparatus according to the invention possesses a treatment device which contains at least one drawframe. In this case, use is preferably made of the development of the invention in which the treatment device is arranged within a treatment chamber and in which the treatment chamber is connected to the air conditioning device.<br>
The air feed can in this case be introduced directly through separate feed orifices and discharge orifices of the treatment chamber or through thread orifices.<br><br>
Preferably, the treatment chamber is connected by means of a fall shaft to the cooling chamber of the cooling device and/or to the air conditioning chamber of the winding device.<br>
Some exemplary embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention are described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention,<br>
fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a sectional view of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention,<br>
fig, 3 shows diagrammatically a partial view of the exemplary embodiment from fig. 2,<br>
fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a sectional view of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates diagrammatically a sectional view of a first exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The apparatus according to the invention is composed of a spinning device 1, of a cooling device 2, of a winding device 4 and of an air conditioning device 3. The spinning device 1 contains a heated spinning head 6 which is connected via a melt feed to a melt source, for example an extruder, not illustrated here. A plurality of spinning devices may in this case be assigned to a common melt source. The spinning head 6 has a spinneret 7 on its underside. In this case, for example, a plurality of spinnerets 7 may be held in a row next to one another on one spinning head 6*<br><br>
The spinneret 7 possesses a multiplicity of nozzle bores, in order in each case to extrude a bunch of fine strandlike filaments from a fed polymer melt- The filament bunch is identified by the reference symbol 10. Below the spinning device 1 is provided the cooling device 2 which has a cooling chamber 8 arranged directly below the spinneret 7. The cooling chamber 8 is connected to a blowing chamber 9 via a permeable blow wall. The blowing chamber 9 is connected to the air conditioning device 3 via an air duct 11.1.<br>
For this purpose, the air conditioning device 3 has an air conditioning unit 46 and a blower 47. By means of the air conditioning unit 46, cooling air is generated which is conveyed into the blowing chamber 9 via the blower 47 and the air duct 11-1-<br>
Below the cooling device 2 are arranged a preparation device 12 and a thread guide 13 which bring together the filament bunch 10 to form a thread 5, For drawing off the filament bunch 10 from the spinning device 1 and for guiding the thread 5 to the winding device 4, two successively driven galette rollers 15.1 and 15.2 are arranged, around which the thread 5 is partially looped.<br>
The winding device 4 contains a plurality of winding components for the winding of the spun thread 5. For this purpose, a traversing device 18, a pressure roller 19 and a winding spindle 21 are provided as winding components. The winding components 18, 19 and 21 are held on a machine stand 22 so as to project. The winding spindle 21 is driven by the spindle drive 23 and the traversing device 18 is driven by the traversing drive 24. The winding components are preceded by a head thread guide 16. The machine stand 22 has adjoining it an air conditioning chamber 17, the<br><br>
walls 48 of which surround the winding components 18 f 19 and 21. The wall 48 of the air conditioning chamber 17 has a narrow thread orifice 25 through which the incoming thread 5 is guided. The air conditioning chamber 17 is connected to the air conditioning device 3 or to the air conditioning unit 46 on the entry side of the thread 5 by means of a feed orifice 28 and an air duct 11.2. For this purpose, the air duct 11.2 is connected to the air conditioning unit 46. On the opposite side of the air conditioning chamber 17 is provided a discharge orifice 29 by means of which the air conditioning chamber 17 is connected to the air conditioning unit 46 of the air conditioning device 3 via the air duct 11.3 and a suck-off appliance 30. A positive guidance of the cooling air is thereby advantageously achieved, the latter flowing in the thread running direction and thus bringing about assisting thread guidance.<br>
At the free end of the winding spindle 21, the air conditioning chamber 17 has a bobbin orifice 26 which is closed by means of a door 27. The bobbin orifice 26 is dimensioned such that a ready-wound bobbin can be drawn off from the winding spindle 21 and can be extracted through the bobbin orifice 26.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, shown in fig. 1, of the apparatus according to the invention, only one thread run is shown as an example. However, the apparatus parts can readily be extended in such a way that a plurality of threads are spun, drawn off and wound in parallel or as a group next to one another. For the high-speed spinning of a thread, a molten polymer melt is fed to the spinning device 1 and is extruded through the spinneret 7 on the underside of the spinning head 6 to form a filament bunch 10. The individual strandlike filaments of the filament bunch 10, immediately they emerge, are guided in the cooling chamber 8 of the<br><br>
cooling device 2. By means of cooling air fed by the air conditioning device 3 and blown uniformly into the cooling chamber 8 through the blowing chamber 9, a cooling of the filament bunch 10 takes place. The filament bunch 10, after emerging from the cooling chamber 8, is brought together by the preparation device 12 and the thread guide 13 to form the thread 5. The thread 5 is guided to the winding device 4 via the galette rollers 15.1 and 15-2. In this case, the thread 5 enters the air conditioning chamber 17 of the winding device 4 through the thread orifice 25 and is wound by means of the traversing device 18, the pressure roller 19 and the winding spindle 21 to form the bobbin 20. For the remaining cooling of the thread 5, cooling air is fed to the air conditioning chamber 17 via the feed orifice 28 and the air duct 11.2 by means of the air conditioning unit 46.  For this purpose,  the air conditioning unit 46 could contain blowing means in the form of blowers. The cooling air enters on the thread inlet side of the air conditioning chamber 17. The cooling air heated within the air conditioning chamber 17 is sucked off on the opposite side through the discharge orifice 29 and the air duct 11.3 by the suck-off  appliance  3 0  and  is  returned  to  the  air conditioning unit 46 for treatment. Uniformly air-conditioned surroundings therefore prevail in the air conditioning chamber 17, so that the thread 5 can be wound under identical conditions, along with sufficient cooling/ to form the bobbin 20.<br>
As soon as the bobbin 20 is ready-wound, winding is interrupted and the bobbin 20 on the winding spindle 21 is exchanged for an empty tube. For this purpose, the door 27 of the bobbin orifice 26 is opened, and the bobbin change is carried out. Subsequently, a renewed bobbin operation is started, and the door 27 of the bobbin orifice 26 is closed.<br><br>
In part regions of the wall 48, the air conditioning chamber 17 preferably has inspection windows, so that the winding process can be observed continuously. Furthermore, parts of the wall 48 of the air conditioning chamber 17 are formed directly by the machine stand 22 or walls of the machine stand 22.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show a further exemplary embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention. The exemplary embodiment is illustrated diagrammatically in a sectional view in fig.  2 and diagrammatically in a partial view in fig. 3. Where no express reference is made to one of the figures, the following description applies to both figures.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in figs. 2 and 3 is essentially identical to the preceding exemplary embodiment, and therefore reference is made to the preceding description and only the differences are illustrated at this juncture. The components having the same function are marked by identical reference symbols*<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to figs. 2 and 3 is composed essentially of a spinning device 1 and of a winding device 4, a draw-off galette roller 31 being arranged at the transition between the spinning device 1 and the winding device 4. The spinning device 1 and the cooling device 2, arranged below the spinning device, are constructed identically to the exemplary embodiment according to fig- 1, the spinning head 6 having a plurality of successively arranged spinerets 7 for the spinning of four threads overall.<br>
Below the cooling device 2, a fall shaft 32 directly adjoins the cooling chamber 8. The fall shaft 32 is connected at the opposite end to an air conditioning chamber 17 of the winding device 4. The winding device<br><br>
4 has, distributed on a longitudinal axis, a plurality of winding stations, A thread 5 is wound into a bobbin 20 at each winding station . For this purpose, the bobbins 20 are held on a winding spindle 21.1. The winding spindle 21.1 is driven in such a way that there is uniform winding speed for winding the threads 5. The winding spindle 21.1 is rotatably mounted in a projecting manner, parallel to the longitudinal axis, on a bobbin turret 33- A second winding spindle 21.2 is arranged at a distance on the bobbin turret. The bobbin turret 33 is mounted rotatably in the machine stand 22, so that the winding spindles 21.1 and 21.2 can be guided .alternately into a winding region and a changing region. For this purpose, the bobbin turret 33 is assigned a drive. In the winding region, the winding spindle 21.1 or 21.2 cooperates with a pressure roller 19 which comes to bear against the circumference of the bobbins 20 to be wound. The pressure roller 19 is mounted rotatably, preferably on a movable carrier which is connected, for example pivotably, to the machine stand 22.<br>
In order to wind the threads 5 into the respective winding stations to form the bobbins 20, a traversing device 18 is provided, by means of which the threads are guided to and fro in each of the winding stations within a traversing stroke.<br>
Above the traversing device 18, a plurality of head thread guides 16 and a plurality of freely rotatable distributor rollers 35 precede said traversing device on a stand part 22.1. The draw-off galette rollers 31 are arranged on the stand part 22.2 laterally next to the winding stations. For the distribution of the threads 5 guided on the circumference of the draw-off galette roller 31, the draw-off galette roller 31 is followed by a thread guide strip 36, by means of which the threads 5 are lead away in a parallel run from the<br><br>
draw-off galette roller 31. The threads 5 are subsequently guided to the winding stations via the distributor rollers 35.<br>
The winding device 4 is in this case arranged with its longitudinal axis transversely with respect to the spinning device 1 and to the draw-off galette roller 8. For this purpose, an operating side of the winding device 4 is formed on the end face on which the draw-off galette roller 31 and the spinning device 1 are provided. An operating panel 34 is arranged at the free end of the machine stand 22 above the freely projecting winding spindle 21.1 and 21.2. Via the operating panel 34, all the controllable actuators and also functional cycles of the winding device 4 and of the draw-off galette roller 31 can be operated by means of one operator. At the same time, the devices in the region of the end face of the winding device 4, which are arranged below the fall shaft 32, can be operated by one person. The walls 48 for forming a closed air conditioning chamber 17 are fastened to the machine stand 22 and the machine stand parts 22.1 and 22.2. In this case, the air conditioning chamber 17 is dimensioned such that essentially all the winding components and all the drives, drive electronics and control electronics are surrounded. For this purpose, the electronic components of the drives are integrated in the machine stand 22. A winding device of this type is known from EP 0 845 432 Al, and therefore reference is made to this publication at this juncture.<br>
For the inlet of the threads 5, a thread orifice 25 is formed in the front region, above the draw-off galette roller 31, in the wall 48 of the air conditioning chamber 17. At the thread orifice 25, the air conditioning chamber 17 directly adjoins the fall shaft 32.<br><br>
On the operating side of the winding device 4, the operating panel 34 is held outside the air conditioning chamber 17 in a freely accessible way. To operate the winding device 4, the air conditioning chamber has, in the region of the winding spindle 21.1 and 21.2, a bobbin orifice 26 which is designed to be closable by means of a door 27. Above the bobbin orifice 26, in the region of the thread entry, a further operating orifice 36 is provided, which is kept closed in the operating state by a further door 37 (fig. 3) . A discharge orifice 29 is formed by a floor grid on the underside of the winding device 4 in the wall 48 of the air conditioning chamber 17, The discharge orifice 29 is connected via a collecting connection 38 and the air duct 11.2 to a suck-off appliance 30 which cooperates with the air conditioning unit 46, The air conditioning device 3 is coupled to the cooling device 2 via the air duct 11.1.<br>
The apparatus illustrated in figs. 2 and 3 is particularly suitable for producing preoriented threads to form what are known as POY yarns. As a result of the L-shaped arrangement of the spinning device 1 and of the winding device 4 in relation to one another, the distribution of the threads 5 to the winding device 4 after treatment can be carried out in an inclined distributor plane oriented transversely with respect to a vertical spinning plane. A very low overall height can thus be implemented, the entire apparatus extending over two tiers, the winding device 4 together with air conditioning chambers 17 being installed in the lowermost tier, and the upper tier having a spinning device 1 together with the melt sources, as extruders. In this case, a cooling air stream which is introduced into the cooling chamber 8 via the cooling device 2 is guided as far as the air conditioning chamber 17 via the fall shaft 32. The cooling air stream in this case passes, together with the threads 5, through the thread<br><br>
orifice 25 of the air conditioning chamber 17 to the winding stations of the winding device 4. The spent cooling air is sucked off through the discharge orifice 29 formed on the underside of the winding device 4 in the air conditioning chamber 17 and is returned to the air conditioning unit 46 via the suck-off appliance 30. The special design of the discharge orifice 29 as a floor grid has the advantage, moreover, that the volatile constituents, such as, for example, preparation residue or else abrasion, occurring during the winding of the threads are also sucked off directly* In the arrangement shown in figs. 2 and 3, thread treatment from spinning to winding takes place in each case in an optimized ambient climate. To intensify the cooling within the air conditioning chamber 17, there is also the possibility of forming an additional feed orifice 28 in the air conditioning chamber 17.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates diagrammatically a sectional view of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is essentially identical to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1, and therefore reference is made to the preceding description and only the differences are indi cat ed at thi s j uncture. The component s having the same function have in this case been given identical reference symbols* The spinning device 1, the cooling device 2 and the winding device 4 are essentially identical to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1. A treatment device 14 is provided between the cooling device 2 and the winding device 4. The treatment device 14 is in this case formed by a tangling device 39 and a drafting device 40. The drafting device 40 has two galette roller units 41.1 and 41.2 which are arranged one below the other and which are formed in each case by a driven galette<br><br>
roller and a freely rotatable overrun roller. The tangling device 39 and the drafting device 40 are arranged within a treatment chamber 42. The treatment chamber 42 has a thread inlet orifice 43 on the top side, in the wall 48, and a thread outlet orifice 44 on the underside. The thread inlet orifice 43 has adjoining it a fall shaft 32 which connects the treatment chamber 42 to the cooling chamber 8 of the cooling device 2. On the outlet side of the treatment chamber 42, a discharge orifice 29 is formed/ which is coupled to the air conditioning unit 46 via an air duct 11.2 and a suck-off appliance 30.<br>
Below the treatment chamber 42 is arranged the winding device 4 which is essentially identical to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1. The winding device 4 in this case has winding components for two winding stations and two winding spindles 22.1 and 22.2 held on a bobbin turret 33. The air conditioning chamber 17 formed at the winding device 4 in this case surrounds all the essential winding . components. A thread orifice 25.1 and 25.2 is in this case formed in the air conditioning chamber 17 in each winding station. The air conditioning chamber 17 has a feed orifice 28 in the upper region and a discharge orifice 29 in the lower region. The feed orifice 28 is assigned a diaphragm 45, by means of which the opening cross section of the feed orifice 28 can be closed completely or partially. The discharge orifice 29 could be assigned a corresponding diaphragm.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in fig. 4, two threads are spun in parallel and next to one another by the spinning device 1, cooled by the cooling device 2 and fed to the treatment device 14. In this case, the threads are prepared by the preparation device 12 and are brought together by the thread guide 13 to a treatment spacing. The threads 5 pass via the fall<br><br>
shaft 32 and via the thread inlet orifice 43 into the treatment chamber 42 in which the treatment device 14 is arranged. The threads 5 are first swirled in parallel and next to one another by the tangling device 39 and are subsequently drafted by the drafting device 40. For the air conditioning of the treatment chamber 12, a cooling air stream is introduced via the fall shaft 32 and the thread inlet orifice 43. The thread inlet orifice 43 is designed correspondingly. The spent cooling air is sucked off from the treatment chamber via the discharge orifice 29 and is returned to the air conditioning unit 46 via the suck-off appliance 30. The treatment chamber 42 preferably possesses an operating orifice which is closed via a door. This situation is not illustrated in fig. 4.<br>
The threads are drawn off from the treatment chamber 42 by the winding device 4. In this case, the threads 5 emerge from the treatment chamber 42 through the thread outlet orifice 44 and pass via the thread orifices 25.1 and 25.2 to the winding stations of the winding device 4. In order to provide appropriately air-conditioned surroundings within the air conditioning chamber 17 of the winding device 4, cooling air provided by the air conditioning device 3 is introduced via the feed orifice 28. In this case, the opening cross section of the feed orifice 28 can be adjusted by means of the diaphragm 45, so that any desired ambient conditions can be provided within the air conditioning chamber 17. Thus, at each step of thread treatment, an ambient situation adapted optimally to the thread can be established. The surroundings in the treatment chamber and in the air conditioning chamber can thus be set independently of one another. There is, however, also the possibility of connecting the treatment chamber 42 directly to the air conditioning chamber 17 of the winding device by means of a fall shaft.<br><br>
The exemplary embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention which have been shown constitute merely an extract of the possible variants. In principle, the invention covers all apparatuses in which air-conditioned surroundings independent of the room climate are provided for thread treatment and thread winding. Apparatuses of this type can therefore advantageously be installed even in rooms which are not air-conditioned. Furthermore, the air conditioning devices required for air conditioning can be designed with a correspondingly low performance. The setup of the air conditioning device which has been shown is likewise only an example.<br><br>
