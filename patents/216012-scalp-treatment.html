SCALP TREATMENT<br>
U N I L E V E R<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>
-   1   -<br>
SCALP TREATMENT<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for topical application to the scalp, methods of treating and/or 5  preventing dandruff and scalp itch and the use of a<br>
synergistic combination of components in the manufacture of a composition for treating and/or preventing dandruff and scalp itch.<br>
10  It is widely believed that Malassezia yeasts, such as<br>
Malassezia furfur,  are the main cause of dandruff. However, it is unclear why some people suffer from this condition while others do not. What is known is that increasing the level of Malassezia  on the scalp does not automatically lead<br>
15  to dandruff. This suggests that Malassezia  is necessary but not sufficient to cause the condition.<br>
The main, if not only, intervention strategy used on the market currently for the treatment of dandruff is the<br>
20  topical application of antifungals such as zinc pyrithione (2nPTO), octopirox and ketoconazole which are normally delivered from a shampoo.  These antifungal agents remove (or at least reduce the level of) the Malassezia  from the scalp, and provide effective treatment of the dandruff<br>
25  condition. In some cases the anti-fungal activity of these actives is complemented by the addition of a secondary active such as salicylic acid which acts as a keratolytic.<br>
However, although clinically proven to be effective in 30  treating the clinical symptoms of dandruff over a 2-4 week period, known anti-dandruff compositions may be less<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>

effective in treating the key consumer symptoms of dandruff rapidly and effectively. The main global consumer symptoms of dandruff are visible skin flakes in hair and on shoulders and scalp itch. " Of the two symptoms, scalp itch may be the more significant symptom of dandruff.<br>
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) comprises a mixture of . positional and geometric isomers of octadecadienoic acid in which the two double bonds have a conjugated configuration. Natural CLA is produced by bacteria present in the rumen and can therefore be found in meat and dairy products derived from ruminants.<br>
A number of potential health benefits have been associated with CLA. Increasing evidence exists for its effects on reducing body fat (Blankson et al. 2000, Mougios et al. 2001, Smedman et al. 2001) and its immunomodulatory effects in humans (Albers et al. 2001).<br>
Furthermore, CLA has anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the risk of<br>
cardiovascular diseases. Loders Croklaan" Lipid Nutrition produces CLA from safflower oil resulting in a 1:1 mixture of cis-9,trans-ll and trans-10,cis-12 isomer of CLA. This mixture is marketed in free fatty acid form (Clarinol™ A) as well as in triacylglycerol-form (Clarinol™* G).<br>
WO 00/37040 teaches skin care compositions enriched in cis-9, trans-11 linoleic acid or derivatives thereof. The compositions are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of normal skin conditions due to ageing or chronoaging, such<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>

as wrinkles, lines, sagging, hyperpigmentation and age spots, and/or of sensitive, dry, rough, flaky, red, itchy and irritated skin.<br>
WO 01/79241 discloses specific glycoside esters of fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acids, and a method for their preparation. WO 01/79241 speculates that the compounds may be useful in a broad range of possible applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food supplements and animal feeds. In particular, WO 01/79241 teaches that glycoside esters of conjugated linoleic acid may prevent fat build up.<br>
WO 02/09664 describes cosmetic or dermatological compositions comprising combinations of bioquinones, potassium channel openers and/or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. The compositions are said to be useful for prolonging the anagenic phase and/or for the treatment and prophylaxis of seborrhoeic symptoms. Conjugated fatty acids may optionally be present in the compositions.<br>
EP 0116439 discloses hair tonic compositions which include fatty acids, such as petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid and arachidonic acid for alleviating dandruff and for stimulating hair growth. There is no mention in this document of conjugated linoleic acid.<br>
There remains a need for topical compositions which are effective for both the treatment and/or prevention of dandruff and scalp itch.<br><br>

Cationic cellulose is available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, NJ, USA) in their Polymer JR (trade mark) and LR (trade mark) series of polymers, as salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted -with trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 10. Another type of cationic cellulose includes the polymeric quaternary ammonium salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with lauryl dimethyl ammonium-substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 24.  These materials are available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, NJ, DSA) under the tradename Polymer LM-200.<br>
Other suitable cationic polysaccharide polymers include quaternary nitrogen-containing cellulose ethers (e.g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,962,418), and copolymers of etherified cellulose and starch (e.g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,958,581).<br>
A particularly suitable type of cationic polysaccharide polymer that can be used is a cationic guar gum derivative, such as guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (Commercially available from Rhodia (formerly Rhone-Poulenc) in their JAGUAR trademark series).<br>
Examples are JAGUAR C13S, which has a low degree of substitution of the cationic groups and high viscosity. JAGUAR C15, having a moderate degree of substitution and a low viscosity, JAGUAR C17 (high degree of substitution, high viscosity), JAGUAR C16, which is a hydroxypropylated cationic guar derivative containing a low level of substituent groups as well as cationic quaternary ammonium groups, and JAGUAR<br><br>

Preferably the cationic deposition polymer is selected from cationic cellulose and cationic guar derivatives. Particularly preferred deposition polymers are JAGUAR C13S, JAGUAR C15, JAGUAR C17 and JAGUAR C16 and JAGUAR C162.<br>
The cationic deposition polymer will generally be present at "levels of from 0.001 to 5%, preferably from about 0.01 to 1%, more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.5% by weight of the total composition..<br>
The compositions of the invention may comprise solid active agents. Suitable solid active agents include pigment particles, such as solid dyes or colorants suitable for application to hair, and metal colloids.<br>
Hair treatment compositions such as shampoos and conditioners are frequently opacified or pearlised to enhance consumer appeal.<br>
Examples of opacifying agents include higher fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl, stearyl, arachidyl and behenyl), solid esters (e.g. cetyl palmitate, glyceryl laurate, stearamide MEA-stearate), high molecular weight fatty amides and alkanolamides and various fatty acid derivatives such as propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol esters. Inorganic materials used to opacify hair treatment compositions include magnesium aluminium silicate, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide.<br><br>

Pearlescing agents typically form thin, platelet-type crystals in the composition, which act like tiny mirrors. This gives the pearl lustre effect. Some of the opacifying agents listed above may also crystallise as pearlescing agents, depending on the media in which they are used and the conditions employed.<br>
Typical pearlescing agents may be selected .from C16-C22 fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid, myristic acid, oleic acid and behenic acid), esters of C16-C22 fatty acid with alcohols and esters of C16-C22 fatty acid incorporating such elements as alkylene glycol units. Suitable alkylene glycol units may include ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. However, higher alkylene chain length glycols may be employed. Suitable higher alkylene chain length glycols include polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.<br>
Examples are polyethylene glycol mono or diesters of C16-C22 fatty acids having from 1 to 7 ethylene oxide units, and ethylene glycol esters of C16-C22 fatty acids. Preferred esters include polyethylene glycol distearates and ethylene glycol distearates. Examples of a polyethylene glycol distearate available commercially are EUPERLAN PK900 (ex Henkel) or GENAPOL TS (ex Hoechst). An example of an ethylene glycol distearate is EUPERLAN PK3000 (ex Henkel).<br>
Other pearlescing agents include alkanolamides of fatty acids having from 16 to 22 carbon atoms, (e.g. stearic monoethanolamide, stearic diethanolamide, stearic monoisopropanolamide and stearic monoethanolamide stearate);<br><br>

long chain esters of long chain fatty acids (e.g. stearyl stearate, cetyl palmitate); glyceryl esters (e.g. glyceryl distearate),long chain esters of long chain alkanolamides (e.g. stearamide DEA distearate, stearamide MEA stearate), and alkyl (C18-C22) dimethyl amine oxides (e.g. stearyl dimethyl amine oxide).<br>
Further suitable pearlescing agents include inorganic materials such as nacreous pigments based on the natural mineral mica. An example is titanium dioxide coated mica. Particles of this material may vary in size from 2 to 150 microns in diameter. In general, smaller particles give rise to a pearly appearance, whereas particles having a larger average diameter will result in a glittery composition.<br>
Suitable titanium dioxide coated mica particles are those sold under the trade names TIMIRON (merck) or FLAMENCO (Mearl) .<br>
The level of opacifying or pearlescing agent employed in compositions of the invention, is generally from 0.01 to 20%, preferably 0.01 to 5%, more preferably from 0.02 to 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Gas (e.g. air) bubbles represent another type of suspended phase that may be introduced into a hair treatment composition for aesthetic purposes. When evenly sized and homogeneously dispersed in the composition, these can enhance consumer appeal.<br><br>

Compositions in accordance with the invention may also be formulated as conditioners for the treatment of hair (typically after shampooing)  and subsequent rinsing.<br>
Such a conditioner will comprise one or more conditioning surfactants which are cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair.<br>
Suitable conditioning surfactants are selected from cationic surfactants,  used singly or in admixture.    Examples include quaternary ammonium hydroxides or salts thereof,  e.g. chlorides.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants for use in hair conditioners of the invention include cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behenyltrimethylammonium chloride,   cetylpyridinium chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride,  tetraethylammonium chloride, octyltrimethylammonium chloride,   dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride,  hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, octyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, decyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, stearyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, didodecyldimethylammonium chloride,<br>

Further suitable cationic surfactants include those materials having the CTFA designations Quaternium-5, Quaternium-31 and Quaternium-18. Mixtures of any of the foregoing materials may also be suitable.    A particularly useful cationic surfactant for use in hair conditioners of the invention is<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, available commercially, for example as GENAMIN CTAC, ex Hoechst Celanese.<br>
In conditioners of the invention,   the level of cationic surfactant is preferably from 0.01 to 10%, more preferably 0.05 to 5%, most preferably 0.1 to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
Conditioners of the invention advantageously incorporate a fatty alcohol. The combined use of fatty alcohols and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a lamellar phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
Representative fatty alcohols comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 20. Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol in conditioners of the invention is conveniently from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition. The weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 10:1 to 1:10, preferably from 4:1 to 1:8, optimally from 1:1 to 1:4.<br>
The compositions of the invention may comprise one or more conditioning agents. As used herein, the term *conditioning agent" includes any material that is used to give a<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCI7EP2003/0J0926<br><br>

particular conditioning benefit to hair and/or skin. For example, in compositions for use in washing hair, such as shampoos and conditioners, suitable materials are those which deliver one or more benefits relating to shine, softness, combability, wet-handling, anti-static properties, protection against damage, body, volume, stylability and manageability.<br>
Preferred conditioning agents for use in the present invention include emulsified silicones, used to impart for example wet and dry conditioning benefits to hair such as softness, smooth feel and ease of combability.<br>
Various methods of making emulsions of particles of silicones for use in the invention are available and are well known and documented in the art.<br>
The viscosity of the silicone itself (not the emulsion or the final washing composition) preferably ranges from 10,000 cps to 5 million cps. The viscosity can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set out further in,Dow Corning Corporate Test Method CTM004 July 20 1970.<br>
Suitable silicones include polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone. An example is dimethicone fluid having a viscosity of up to 100,000 centistokes at 25° C, which is available commercially from the General Electric Company as the Viscasil series and from Dow Coming as the DC 200 series.<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT7EP2003/010926<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
Aminofunctional silicones which have the CTFA designation araodimethicone, are also suitable for use in the compositions of the invention, as are polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups, which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol.<br>
Also suitable are silicone gums. "Silicone gum" denotes polydiorganosiloxanes having a molecular weight of from 200,000 to 1,000,000 g/mol and specific examples include dimethicone gums, dimethiconol gums, polydimethyl siloxane/diphenyl/methylvinylsiloxane copolymers, polydimethylsiloxane/methylvinylsiloxane copolymers and mixtures thereof. Examples include those materials described in US Pat. No. 4,152,416 (Spitzer), and on General Electric Silicone Rubber product Data Sheet SE 30, SE 33, SE 54 and SE 76.<br>
Also suitable for use in the present invention are silicone gums having a slight degree of cross-linking, as are described for example in WO 96/31188. These materials can impart body, volume and stylability to hair, as well as good wet and dry conditioning.<br>
Preferred emulsified silicones for use in compositions of the invention have an average silicone particle size in the composition of less than 100, preferably less than 30, more preferably less than 20 microns, most preferably less than 10 microns.<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>

Particle size may be measured by means of a laser light scattering technique, using a 2600D Particle Sizer from Malvern Instruments.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions for use in the invention are commercially available in a pre-emulslfied form. This is particularly preferred since the pre-formed emulsion can be incorporated into the washing composition by simple mixing.<br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed emulsions include emulsions DC2-1766 and DC2-1784, available from Dow Corning. These are emulsions of dimethiconol. Cross-linked silicone gums are also available in a pre-emulsified form, which is advantageous for ease of formulation. A preferred example is the material available from Dow Corning as DC X2-1787, which is an emulsion of cross-linked dimethiconol gum.<br>
The amount of silicone incorporated into the compositions of the invention depends on the level of conditioning desired • and the material used. A preferred amount is from 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the total composition although these limits are not absolute. The lower limit is determined by the minimum level to achieve conditioning and the upper limit by the maximum level to avoid making the hair and/or skin unacceptably greasy. We have found that an amount of silicone of from 0.5 to 1.5% by weight of the total composition, is a particularly suitable level.<br>
A further preferred class of conditioning agents are per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon materials, used to enhance the body, volume and stylability of hair.<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>

EP. 567 326 and EP 498 119 describe suitable perallc(en)yl hydrocarbon materials for imparting stylability and enhanced body to hair. Preferred materials are polyisobutylene materials available from Presperse, Inc. under the PERMETHYL trade name.<br>
The amount of per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon material incorporated into the compositions of the invention depends on the level of body and volume enhancement desired and the specific material used. A preferred amount is from 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the total composition although these limits are not absolute. The lower limit is determined by the minimum level to achieve the body and volume enhancing effect and the upper limit by the maximum level to avoid making the hair unacceptably stiff. We have found that an amount of per-alk(en)yl hydrocarbon material of from 0.5 to 2% by weight of the total composition is a particularly suitable level.<br>
When "the hydrocarbon material is lipophilic, it may constitute all or part of the lipophilic agent of the invention.<br>

The" compositions of the invention may be packaged in any suitable mariner such as in a jar, a bottle, a tube, a roll-ball, or the like, in the conventional manner.<br>
The method of the invention may be carried out from once or twice daily to once weekly to the area of the scalp that requires treatment. The improvement in the appearance and/or feel of the scalp will usually appear after one to six weeks, depending on the condition of the scalp, the concentration of the active ingredients used in the method, the amount of the composition used and the frequency with which it is applied.<br>
In general, a quantity of the"composition, for example, from 0.1 to 10 ml is applied to the scalp from a suitable container or applicator and spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hands or fingers or a suitable device. A. rinsing step may follow depending on whether the composition is formulated as a "leave on" or a ttrinse-off" product.<br>
The system of the invention for treating dandruff (which can also be termed a kit of parts) comprises: a first component comprising an anti-dandruff agent; and a second component comprising conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The first component and the second component are both suitable for, and are preferably adapted for, topical application to the scalp. The first component and the second component are formulated differently (for example, one component may be a lotion and the other a shampoo, or one component may be a shampoo and the other a conditioner). The first component and the second component are applied to the scalp in the<br><br>

Composition D is an anti-dandruff (AD) shampoo composition used in the following protocol.<br>
Protocol<br>
The effect of conjugated linoleic acid, used in conjunction with anti-dandruff (AD) and non anti-dandruff (NAD) shampoo, was clinically assessed using the following protocol.<br>
The conjugated linoleic acid is used as a lotion (composition B) . The lotion base comprises Tween™ 20, Carbopol™ 980, Sodium Hydroxide, Natrosol™ 250HHR, EDTA-2Na, glydant plus and water (composition A). The use of the lotion is followed by a shampoo wash with an NAD shampoo (composition C) or an AD shampoo (composition D).<br>
A randomised monadic double blind study design was used based on a total of 240 screened panellists, male and female, with self-perceived dandruff. All 240 panellists used a placebo shampoo (composition C) in their normal hair wash routine for 4 successive weeks.<br>
The panellists were divided into four groups (total number of panellists = 240):<br>
Group 1: 60 panellists. All panellists wash their hair with NAD shampoo at home 3 times a week and apply CLA lotion one hour prior to washing their hair.<br><br>

Group 2: 60 panellists. All panellists wash their hair with NAD shampoo at home 3 times a week and apply lotion base (composition A) one hour prior to washing their hair.^<br>
Group 3: 60 panellists. All panellists wash their hair with AD shampoo at home 3 times a week and apply CLA lotion one hour prior to washing their hair.<br>
Group 4: 60 panellists. All panellists wash their hair with AD shampoo at home 3 times a week and apply lotion base (composition A) one hour prior to washing their hair.<br>
After their fourth visit, the panellists are instructed not to apply lotion i.e., either base lotion (composition A), or CLA containing lotion (composition B) to their scalp prior to washing with shampoo for the remainder of the study. Panellists come to the study centre at the same frequency as before i.e., once a week for the next five successive weeks for scalp assessments and continue hair washing at home as before but without using any lotion.<br>
In order to assess the degree of itching at each visit to the study centre, subjects are interviewed by an investigator about their itch feeling on:<br>
1)	Itch degree .<br>
2)	Itch lasting time<br>
3)	Itch frequency<br><br>
WO 2004/035015<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/010926<br><br>

According to the subject"s response, the investigator will give a value from the standard scale for the degree of itch feeling. The standard scale is as follows:<br>
0	=None<br>
1	=Mild<br>
2	=Moderate <br>
3	=Marked<br>
4	=Severe<br>
Analysis of itch scores is carried out using analysis of variance to test for main effects and interactions of NAD and AD shampoo and CLA containing lotion. The following individual comparisons are made testing for significant differences at the 5% level. Data transforms or non-parametric methods are used where necessary.<br>
1)	Non AD shampoo + CLA lotion vs Non AD shampoo + base lotion<br>
2)	AD shampoo + CLA lotion vs AD shampoo + base lotion<br>
3)	AD shampoo + CLA lotion vs Non AD shampoo + CLA lotion<br>
The results from the above anti-itch study are summarised in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows the results of the anti-itch study from the panellists in group 1 (NAD/CLA), group 2 (NAD/base), group 3 (AD/CLA) and group 4 (AD/Base) in graphical form with itch<br><br>

- 37 -<br>
degree on the vertical axis and the week number of the protocol on the horizontal axis.<br>
In Figure 1, the graph shows that throughout the anti-itch study, the combination of anti-dandruff (AD) shampoo and conjugated linoleic acid lotion (CLA), as used by the panellists in group 3, unexpectedly lowers the degree of itch of the scalp compared to the compositions used in the other groups.<br>
The results from group 3 are particularly surprising in view of the results from group 2 and group 1. Thus, the results from group 1 show that when CLA is used in combination with an NAD shampoo (NAD/CLA), the degree of itch is actually higher than when an NAD shampoo is used in combination with the base composition (composition A) as in group 2. This comparison shows that CLA can increase the degree of scalp itch.<br>
The results from group 4 show that when an AD shampoo is combined with the base composition, the degree of itch can be lowered. When CLA is combined with an anti-dandruff shampoo, as in group 3, the degree of itch is significantly lowered. This would not have been expected from the results of group 1, which suggest that the addition of CLA should actually increase the degree of itch.<br>
Therefore the results shown graphically in Figure 1 indicate that there is an unexpected synergistic effect obtained from using the combination of anti-dandruff agent and conjugated linoleic acid.<br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
