TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
The subject matter described herein, in general, relates to a vibration damper and in particular, relates to a vibration damper for a pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler. BACKGROUND:<br>
In a two-wheeler, footrests are provided on both sides of a frame structure for a driver and a pillion rider. Apart from safe positioning of the feet, the footrest aids the driver in shifting the gears and also in applying the brakes. A pillion footrest assembly is provided for supporting the feet of the pillion rider. In conventional two-wheelers, the pillion footrest assembly includes a pillion footrest bracket and a pillion footrest peg.<br>
Generally, the pillion footrest bracket is rigidly attached at a swing arm mounting position on the frame structure. To enhance the strength of attachment, the pillion footrest bracket is further attached at a lower mounting position on the frame structure. Generally, the bracket has an overhang portion on which the pillion footrest peg is hingedly attached. Positioning of the pillion footrest peg on the pillion footrest bracket depends upon the vehicle layout and thus its position varies from one vehicle model to another.<br>
When the two-wheeler is in motion, the overhang portion of the pillion footrest bracket causes high vibrations. These vibrations get transferred to the pillion footrest peg resulting in discomfort to the pillion rider. Further, these vibrations can also cause damage to the two-wheeler in case the frequency of these vibrations matches with the natural frequency of the frame structure resulting in the phenomena of resonance. Resonance substantially increases vibrations in the frame structure and hence can lead to failure of various mechanical parts of the two-wheeler.<br><br>
Therefore, the challenge is to minimize the unwanted vibrations in a pillion footrest assembly. SUMMARY:<br>
The subject matter described herein is directed to a vibration damper for a pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler. The present subject matter proposes a solution to eliminate the vibrations from the pillion footrest assembly as felt by a pillion rider while riding on the two-wheeler. Since the vibration damper is concealed within the frame structure, the present subject matter ensures that the aesthetics of the two-wheeler.<br>
In accordance with at least one aspect of the present subject matter, a pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler includes a pillion footrest bracket extending longitudinally and substantially downwardly of the two-wheeler. The pillion footrest bracket has a first side and a second side, wherein the second side is dorsal to the first side. The second side of the pillion footrest bracket is secured rigidly to the frame structure of the two-wheeler. Further, a U-shaped bracket is disposed on the first side of the pillion footrest bracket. The U-shaped bracket hingedly supports a pillion footrest peg. A vibration damper mass is disposed on the second side of the pillion footrest bracket such that the vibration damper mass is secured substantially opposite to the pillion footrest peg.<br>
The vibration damper mass is secured at a predetermined position on the pillion footrest bracket such that the vibrations of the vibration damper mass counter-balances the vibrations of the pillion footrest assembly, thereby damping the unwanted vibrations from the two-wheeler pillion footrest. This eliminates the vibrations caused by the<br><br>
overhang portion of the pillion footrest bracket substantially, thereby increasing the rider's comfort and safety.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present subject matter will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
The above and other features, aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings where:<br>
FIG.l illustrates a perspective view of a two-wheeler in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter.<br>
FIG.2 illustrates a side view of the frame structure of the two-wheeler as shown in FIG.l.<br>
FIG.3 shows a side view of a pillion footrest bracket attached to a two-wheeler. FIG.4 shows a perspective view of the pillion footrest bracket. FIG.5 shows a cross-sectional view of a pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler. FIG.6 shows comparison of vibration response with and without a vibration damper mass.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
The challenge of eliminating the vibrations felt by a pillion rider when riding a two-wheeler is overcome by providing a vibration damper mass substantially opposite to a pillion footrest peg. The vibration damper mass is secured at a predetermined position on a pillion footrest bracket such that the frequency of the vibration damper mass and a stiffness member counter balances the excitation frequency of the vibrations, thereby damping the unwanted vibrations from a pillion footrest. This substantially eliminates the vibrations caused by the overhang member of the pillion footrest bracket, thereby increasing the pillion ride comfort and safety. A pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler includes a pillion footrest bracket extending longitudinally and substantially downwardly of the two-wheeler. The pillion footrest bracket has a first side and a second side, wherein the second side is dorsal to the first side. The second side of the pillion footrest bracket is secured rigidly to the frame structure at a swing arm mounting position and a lower arm mounting position of the two-wheeler. Further, a U-shaped bracket is disposed on the first side of the pillion footrest bracket. The U-shaped bracket hingedly supports a pillion footrest peg. The pillion footrest peg is hingedly attached to the U-shaped bracket by a first bolt wherein the first bolt is locked in a predetermined position by a pin. The pillion footrest peg is of a length such that when extended transversally the pillion footrest peg serves as a support for resting the feet on the two-wheeler. A vibration damper mass is disposed on the second side of the pillion footrest bracket such that the vibration damper mass is secured substantially opposite to the pillion footrest peg by a fastening means that includes a nut, a washer and a second bolt. Further, one or more<br><br>
spacers are provided between the washer and the vibration damper mass to effectively reduce the vibrations from the pillion footrest.<br>
FIG.l illustrates a perspective view of a two-wheeler in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. As used herein, the terms "front", "rear", "left", "righf, "up", and "down" correspond to the direction assumed by the rider of the vehicle. The two-wheeler is configured for accommodating two persons, a driver and a pillion rider. The two-wheeler comprises a frame structure 100, on which a pillion footrest bracket 105 is rigidly secured. The pillion footrest bracket 105 extends longitudinally and substantially downward along the two-wheeler.<br>
FIG.2 illustrates a side view of the frame structure of the two-wheeler shown in FIG.l wherein a pillion footrest peg 200 serves as a support for resting feet of the pillion rider, on the two-wheeler. The pillion footrest bracket 105 is rigidly secured at a swing arm mounting position 205 and a lower mounting position 210 of the frame structure 100.<br>
FIG.3 shows a side view of a pillion footrest bracket attached to a two-wheeler. The first side 300 of the pillion footrest bracket 105 is shown in the figure.<br>
FIG.4 shows a perspective view of a pillion footrest bracket depicting the second side 400 of the pillion footrest bracket 105. The second side 400 is dorsal to the first side 300 of the pillion footrest bracket 105.<br>
FIG,5 shows a cross-sectional view of a pillion footrest assembly of a two-wheeler. The pillion footrest peg 200 is hingedly attached to a U-shaped bracket 500 by a first bolt 505. The first bolt 505 is locked in a predetermined position by a pin 510. The predetermined position is based on the normal feet position of the pillion rider. The pillion footrest peg 200 is of a length such that when extended transversally, the pillion<br><br>
footrest peg 200 serves as a support for resting a foot of a pillion rider on the two-wheeler. A vibration damper mass 515 is disposed on the second side 400 of the pillion footrest bracket 105. The vibration damper mass 515 is disposed substantially opposite to the pillion footrest peg 200 and is secured by a fastening means. The fastening means include a washer 520, a nut 525 and a second bolt 535. The material of the vibration damper mass 515, for example, is mild steel. The weight of the vibration damper mass 515 depends on the frequency of the vibrations that is intended to be absorbed. Also, one or more spacers 530 are provided between the washer 520 and the vibration damper mass 515. The spacer 530 along with the second bolt 535 acts as the stiffness member of the pillion footrest assembly. The spacer 530 secures the vibration damper mass 515 at a predetermined position so that unwanted vibrations are counter balanced effectively. FIG.6 shows comparison of vibration response with and without a vibration damper mass 515.<br>
The graph 600 depicts the vibrations felt by the pillion rider while resting a foot on the pillion footrest peg 200 without a vibration dampening mechanism. The graph 605 depicts the vibrations felt by the pillion rider while resting a foot on the pillion footrest peg 200 with a vibration damper mass 515. As shown, adding a vibration damper mass 515 substantially opposite to the pillion footrest peg 200 reduces the vibrations that are caused by the overhang portion of the pillion footrest bracket 105.<br>
