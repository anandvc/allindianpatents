A METHOD OF SYNCHRONIZING COMMUNICATIONS MEANS IN A BATTERY COMMUNICATIONS MEANS IN AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND<br>
AN APPARATUS THEREOF" <br><br><br><br><br><br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (PUBL), a Swedish company, S-126 25 Stockholm, Sweden,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of synchroniz¬ing a second communications means in a battery attached to an electronic device to a first communications means in said electronic device, wherein bytes consisting of a number of bits are transmitted between said electronic device and said battery by means of said first and second communications means using digital/ serial communication. The invention further relates to a corresponding appara¬tus and a corresponding battery.<br>
In recent years the cellular telephone technology has de¬veloped rapidly and thus created a similar need for de¬velopment in the area of batteries and battery packs, and more specifically, for communicating between a battery and an electronic device, such as a cellular telephone. Cellular telephones must utilize batteries in order to provide mobile capabilities. The battery is critical to the user of a cellular telephone, since the battery pro¬vides the ability to move about freely without being tied to a stationary power source.<br>
Thus, in order to maximize the use of a cellular tele¬phone, and other portable electronic devices, it is im¬portant that a user achieves maximum performance from the attached battery. This may be achieved by correctly charging the battery and always being able to identify the exact charging status of the battery. This enables the user to know how much standby time is left on the phone. This type of information enables the user to in¬telligently decide whether the charge in a battery is<br><br>
sufficient for his needs, or whether charging of the bat¬tery is required.<br>
Recent developments of battery and battery pack related   technologies have provided users with so-called "smart" batteries which can provide a user with a power source for an electronic device and further provide data trans¬mission capabilities between the battery and the attached electronic device. This type of batteries may contain<br>
  storage means adapted to store various data representing information which may be presented to a user, e.g. in a display of the portable device. The information in a bat¬tery can include different information such as an identi¬fication number, the maximum capacity, the present capac-<br>
   ity, and other relevant information.<br>
Some information from the battery is only used internally in the portable electronic device, while other informa¬tion from the battery can be presented to the user, e.g.<br>
  after having been processed by a processor in the battery or in the portable electrical device. For example, the stored information about the maximum capacity of the bat¬tery may be used in the electronic device only, while the present capacity may be calculated by the electronic de-<br>
  vice using the maximum capacity (or a previous value of the present capacity) and knowledge about the power con¬sumption of the electronic device.<br>
Therefore data is exchanged between the electronic device   and the battery. This data exchange is normally performed using means enabling digital, serial asynchronous commu¬nication over an interface between communications means in the electronic device and communications means in the battery.<br><br>
When using batteries which hold a number of different data, it is of interest to use bi-directional communica¬tions means enabling data to be transmitted in both di¬rections. For example when the electronic device acts as   a master and the battery as a slave, the electronic de¬vice can retrieve desired information by sending a com¬mand to the battery and receive data from the battery in response.<br>
  In order to communicate, the communications means in the electronic device and the communications means in the battery have to be synchronized as there is an absolute limit for the acceptable timing variations between these communications when the transmitted signals have to be<br>
  received correctly. The baud rate of serial asynchronous communication in compact systems is often fixed. This im¬plies that both units need exact crystals to ensure sta¬ble timing. This has the drawback of being an expensive solution and is therefore normally of no interest in re-<br>
  lation to portable electronic devices and batteries where the price is an important parameter. Further, the use of crystals in batteries when minimizing the size of batter¬ies is of interest.<br>
  The object of the invention is to provide a method of the above-mentioned type which is simpler and cheaper com¬pared to methods according to the prior art.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a   method in which a predetermined bit sequence is appended to at least some bytes prior to the transmission from said first communications means to said second communica¬tions means, said bit sequence is detected in the signal received by said second communication means, the time in-   terval between given shifts in the detected bit sequence<br><br>
is measured, and said synchronization is performed by means of said measured time interval.<br>
Hereby, as synchronization based on said measured time<br>
  interval can be performed continuously, a baud rate tim¬ing can be performed in the battery by use of less sta¬ble, simpler and less expensive oscillation circuits com¬pared to the use of expensive crystals according to the prior art.<br><br>
Preferably, said appended bit sequence is transmitted prior to the transmission of the remaining bits in said byte, and said synchronization is performed prior to re¬ceiving said remaining bits.<br><br>
Preferably, said bit sequence includes two bits of dif¬ferent value, and said time interval is specified by a shift defining the beginning of the first bit and a shift between said two bits. By reducing the amount of bit ap-<br>
   pended bytes used for synchronizing purposes the amount of bits to be transmitted is reduced.<br>
Preferably, every one of said bytes includes said ap¬pended predetermined bit sequence. As a result, the syn-   chronization can be performed each time a byte is re¬ceived.<br>
In another embodiment at least one of said bytes does not include an appended predetermined bit sequence. Hereby    the total amount of bits transmitted can be reduced.<br>
As mentioned, the present invention also relates to an apparatus comprising an electronic device, a battery at¬tached thereto, means enabling digital, serial communica-   tion over an interface between the electronic device and the battery, and comprising first communications means in<br><br>
the electronic device and second communications means in the battery, said digital, serial communication compris¬ing transmission of bytes consisting of a number of bits between said first and second communications means.<br>
In an apparatus according to the invention said first communications means is adapted to append a predetermined bit sequence having at least two shifts to at least some bytes prior to the transmission to said second communica¬tions means, said second communications means are further adapted to detect said bit sequence in a received signal, to measure the time interval between given shifts in said bit sequence, and to synchronize said second communica¬tions means to said first communications means by means of said measured time interval.<br>
Hereby, as synchronization based on said measured time interval can be performed continuously, a baud rate tim¬ing can be performed in the battery by means of less sta¬ble, simpler and less expensive oscillation circuits com¬pared to the use of expensive crystals according to the prior art.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, said first communica¬tions means is adapted to transmit said appended bit se¬quence prior to the transmission of the remaining bits in said byte,  and said second communications means  is adapted to perform said synchronization prior to receiv¬ing said remaining bits. Hereby it is ensured said second communications means has just been synchronized to said first communications means when the remaining bits are received.<br>
Preferably, said first communications means is adapted to append a predetermined bit sequence including two bits of different values,  and that said second communications<br><br>
means is adapted to perform said synchronization based on a time interval specified by a shift defining the begin¬ning of the first bit and a shift between said two bits. By reducing the amount of bit appended bytes used for synchronizing purposes the amount of bits to be transmit¬ted is reduced.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, said first communications means is adapted to append said predeter¬mined bit sequence to every one of said bytes.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment, said first communications means is adapted to append said pre¬determined bit sequence to some of said bytes while other bytes are not appended to said predetermined bit se¬quence .<br>
Preferably, said electronic device is a cellular tele¬phone .<br>
The present invention further relates to a battery com¬prising means enabling digital, serial communication over an interface between the battery and an electronic de¬vice, and comprising communications means in the battery, said digital, serial communication comprising transmis¬sion of bytes consisting of a number of bits to and from said communication means.<br>
In a battery according to the invention said communica¬tions means includes synchronization means adapted to de¬tect a predetermined bit sequence in a received byte, to measure the time interval between given shifts in said bit sequence, and to synchronize said communication means in accordance with the measured time interval. Hereby the    communications means of the battery can be syncronized in<br><br>
accordance with a received signal, resulting in a simpler and less expensive solution compared to the prior art.<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 shows an apparatus according to the invention,<br>

Figure 3 is an example of a byte to be used in relation to the above mentioned transmission,<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the transmission of bytes, and<br>
Figure 5 is a state diagram illustrating the synchronisa¬tion of an oscillator in the battery.<br>
Figure 1 shows an apparatus 101 comprising an electronic device 102 and a battery or battery pack 103 attached thereto. The apparatus 101 further comprises a number of connections 104, 105, 106 connecting the electronic de¬vice 102 and the battery 103 and thus allowing communica¬tion between the electronic device 102 and the battery 103.<br>
The electronic device 102 comprises a transceiver 108, which is also called the first communications means in the following, and a micro-controller 109. The trans¬ceiver 108 and the micro-controller 109 are adapted to exchange data, which is illustrated by means of the ref¬erence sign 110 and 111 in the figure. The micro¬controller 109 can transmit information to the trans¬ceiver 108 by means of the connection 111. Likewise the connection 110 can be used to transmit data from the<br><br>
transceiver 108 to the micro-controller 109. The trans¬ceiver 108 may be a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART).<br>
The battery includes one or more battery cells 113, a mi¬cro-controller 114 (which may be a state machine), a bat¬tery information acquisition unit 115, a transceiver 117 and a memory 116. It is noted that the transceiver 117 is also called the second communications means in the fol¬lowing. Also the transceiver 117 may be a universal asyn¬chronous receiver transmitter (UART) .<br>
The connections 104 and 105 are used to supply power from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102. For example the connector 104 may be connected to the positive pole of the battery cells 113 in the battery 103, and the con¬nector 105 may be connected to a battery negative pole (GND) of the battery cells 113 in the battery 103.<br>
The transceiver 108 included in the electronic device 102 is connected to the transceiver 117 in the battery 103 by means of the connection 106 enabling digital, serial com¬munication comprising transmission of bytes consisting of a number of bits between the first and the second commu¬nications means. The memory 116 is adapted to store a number of data information, for example an identification number of the battery, the maximum capacity of the bat¬tery, the current capacity of the battery, etc.<br>
The micro-controller 114 is connected to the transceiver 117, to the battery information acquisition unit 115, and to the memory 116, The battery information acquisition unit 115 is connected to the battery cells 113 and is adapted to retrieve battery information, such as the cur¬rent battery capacity, etc. from the battery cells 113. The battery information acquisition unit 115 is adapted<br><br>
to transmit the information to the micro-controller	114<br>
when instructed to do so by the micro-controller 114.	The<br>
micro-controller 114 is adapted to store and retrieve	the<br>
information from the memory 116 and to transmit the	in¬<br>
formation to the electronic device 102 by means of	the<br>
transceiver 117.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a part of the electronic device 102 interfacing with a part of the battery 103 and shows the connection 106 adapted to connect the electronic device 102 and the battery 103 in relation to the connection 106 shown in Figure 1. The left side of Figure 2 illustrates a part of the electronic device 102 while the right side of Figure 2 illustrates a part of the battery 103. As shown in the figure, the electronic device 102 and the battery 103 are connected by means of an interface 201.<br>
The electronic device 102 includes a control unit 202 and a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter unit 203, i.e. a so-called UART. Likewise, the battery 103 includes a control unit 204. The electronic device 102 and the battery 103 are adapted to transmit data via the inter¬face 201. The transmission is performed by means of a pull-up resistor 207, a switch 205, and a switch 206. The switch 205 in the electronic device is connected to be controlled by the control unit 202. Likewise, the switch 206 in the battery 103 is connected to be controlled by the control unit 204.<br>
The switch 205 and the switch 206 are both connected to ground potential. This enables the control units 202, 204 to transmit information over the interface 201 in turn. The transmission of information from the electronic de¬vice 102 to the battery 103 is controlled by the control unit 202. The control unit 202 is adapted to control the switch 205 and hereby send the information to the battery<br><br>
103. For example, when the switch 205 is open, the pull-up resistor 207 pulls the potential at the communications line 106 to a high level. On the other hand, when the switch is closed, the potential at the communication line 106 is at a low level. Hereby, by controlling the posi¬tion of the switch 205 the control unit 202 controls the potential at the communications line 106, and as the com¬munication line is connected to the battery 103 informa¬tion can be transmitted from the electrical device 102 to the battery 103.<br>
Likewise, the control unit 204 can transmit information from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102 by means of the switch 206. The data generated by the switch 205 in the electronic device 102 are received in a UART 211 which can be similar to the UART 203 in the elec¬tronic device 102.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, bytes including a number of bits are transmitted between the electronic device 102 and the battery 103. The format of these bytes is illus¬trated in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of a byte consisting of a num¬ber of bits which can be used in relation to the above-mentioned transmission. The byte 300 is divided into three sections: a first section 301 including two start bits, a second section 302 including a number of data bits, and a third section 303 including a stop bit.<br>
The first section 301 includes two start bits 304, 305 and is used to indicate the start of the byte 300 during transmission. Preferably, the start bits have different values, e.g. the start bit 304 is a logic "0" while the start bit 305 is a logic "1". The second section 302 in¬cludes a number of data bits (for example eight) having<br><br>
values depending on the information being transmitted. The third section 303 includes a stop bit used to indi¬cate the end of the byte. As will become clear from the following, the stop bit is often not necessary, e.g. when the transmitted bytes are separated by periods having a signal level corresponding to the value of the stop bit's, or when bytes transmitted have a fixed length.<br>
Figure 4 is a timing diagram illustrating the transmis¬sion of bytes over the communications line 106 between the electronic device 102 and the battery 103. Note that the time is increasing from the left to the right in the figure.<br>
The figure shows a first byte 401 being transmitted from electronic device 102 to the battery 103 via the communi¬cation line 106 followed by a second byte 402 being transmitted in the reverse direction via the communica¬tions line 106, i.e. from the battery 103 to the elec¬tronic device 102.<br>
The time intervals illustrating the transmission of the first byte and the transmission of the second byte are separated by a time interval indicated by 405 in the fig¬ure. The duration of the time interval 405 is specified by the required response time and minimum set-up time for reversing the direction of communication.<br>
One or more of the electronic means in the battery, e.g. the micro-processor 114 can be in an active state or in a power saving state. In the power saving state the commu¬nication line is in a so-called idle state. Hereby, the power consumption of these electronic means can be re¬duced during periods when no bytes are transmitted be¬tween the electronic device 102 and the battery 103.<br><br>
Prior to the transmission of the first byte the transmis¬sion line is in idle state in which the signal level on the transmission line equals a level of logic "0". In the figure the idle period situation is indicated by the ref¬erence sign 403. The control unit 202 brings the trans¬mission line into an so-called active state by bringing the signal level on the transmission line 106 to a high level as indicated by the period 404 in the figure. The period 404 is a so-called wake-up period in which one or more of the electronic means in the battery are brought from a power saving state to a normal power consumption state.<br>
As illustrated to the right in the figure, the byte 402 is followed by a an interval 406 in which the signal level at the transmission line 106 equals a level of logic "1", i.e. a situation similar to the situation in¬dicated by the interval 405. The minimum duration of the time interval 406 is specified by the required response time and minimum set-up time for reversing the direction of communication. The interval 406 is followed by a shift from the level of logic "1" to a level of logic u0" indi¬cating a situation in which the transmission line 106 is brought into an idle state. Alternatively, the shift could be indicating the start of a new byte being trans¬mitted, i.e. the shift corresponds to the beginning of a new start bit. It is noted that the transmission line can be brought into an idle state when the duration of the time interval 406 exceeds a given predefined value.<br>
The bytes transmitted via the transmission line 106 can include instructions as well as data. The instructions may include so-called read-only instructions sent by the electronic device 102 and instructing the battery 103 to read specified information from the memory 116 and send the information as one or more data bytes in response.<br><br>
For example, the read-only instruction may. instruct the battery to send information on the nominal capacity or the battery serial number. The instruction may also in¬clude so-called read/write instructions. For example in¬structions causing reading or writing the presently re¬maining capacity of the battery. Further, the instruction set may include instructions causing sending and receiv¬ing information of the battery communications bus revi¬sion, and causing reading and writing of a dynamic iden¬tification number.<br>
The revision information specifies the communications bus revision supported. After exchanging the revision number of the battery communications bus, the micro-controllers 109,114 can use a common communications standard sup¬ported by both the electronic device 102 and the battery 103. Hereby, communication between an electronic device 102 and a battery can be obtained even if one of those only supports a later communications standard than the other.<br>
The dynamic identification number is used for communica¬tion purposes. The electronic device 102 is adapted to store a given dynamic identification number in both the memory 116 of the battery 103 and in a memory of the electronic device 102. The dynamic identification number may be stored when a battery 103 is connected to the electronic device 102 but can also be stored at an arbi¬trary time, provided the battery 103 is connected to the electronic device 102.<br>
When the battery' is connected to the electronic device 102 the dynamic identification number is transmitted from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102. Hereafter, the dynamic identification number from the battery 103 is compared to one or more dynamic identification numbers<br><br>
stored in the electronic device 102. If the-dynamic iden¬tification number of the battery does not correspond to a dynamic identification number from the electronic device 102, it means that the battery has been used by other equipment or it may be a completely brand new battery. Therefore, the electronic device 102 does not have cur¬rent information about the status of the battery, and the electronic device will retrieve information from the bat¬tery 102, e.g. information about the presently remaining capacity of the battery 102. If, on the other hand, the dynamic identification number of the battery corresponds to a dynamic identification number from the electronic device 102, the battery has not been used by other equip¬ment, and the electronic device may use information on the battery stored in the electronic device instead of information retrieved from the battery. Whether the in¬formation from the electronic device 102 or information from the battery 103 is used depends on other information stored in the battery 103, e.g. information indicating if the battery has been recharged since being disconnected from the electronic device. If this is the case, the mo¬bile phone retrieves the battery capacity from the bat¬tery. If this is not the case, the mobile phone uses pre¬viously stored internal information on the battery capac¬ity instead. The reason why it is of interest to use in¬ternally stored information instead of information from the battery is that the electronic device is normally able to store the information with a higher resolution because of the greater available memory.<br>
It is noted that the electronic device may be a mobile phone or a battery charger. For example, both a mobile phone and a battery charger may perform the above-mentioned reading and writing of dynamic identification numbers and on this basis decide whether to use previ-<br><br>
ously stored information about the battery-103 or alter¬natively retrieve the information from the battery 103.<br>
Error handling is essentially based upon an echoing mechanism used for commands and data, i.e. retransmission in relation to commands and data. Referring to Figure 4, the first byte 401 may be transmitted by the electronic device 102 to the battery 103. When the byte 401 is re¬ceived by the battery 103, the byte is re-transmitted as the byte 402 from the battery 103 to the electronic de¬vice 102. When the byte 402 is received in the electronic device 102, the byte 402 is compared with the byte 401 originally sent. If the bytes 401 and 402 do not coincide an error is detected.<br>
In relation to write commands, re-transmission can be carried out in the following way. Firstly, the byte 401 sent by the electronic device 102 is received by the bat¬tery 103. Secondly, the received byte is written into a non-volatile memory 116 of the battery 103. Thirdly, the byte is read from the battery non-volatile memory. And finally, the read byte is retransmitted from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102 and the error detection can be performed. Thus it is also checked that the byte was correctly written into the memory 116.<br>
Note, the above mentioned error detection can also be performed on bytes transmitted from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102.<br>
Now referring to Figure 4, the bytes transmitted between the electronic device and the battery include a first start bit 304 (logical "0") and a second byte 305 (logical "1"). The start bit is used for synchronizing a hardware timer in the battery 103 in accordance with a received signal, as shown in Figure 5.<br><br>
Figure 5 is a state diagram illustrating the synchroniza¬tion of an oscillator in the battery by means of received bytes. In the standby state 501, i.e. when the transmis¬sion line 106 is in an idle state, the signal level on the transmission line 106 (which is also called "BATTCOM") corresponds to logical "0", i.e. BATTCOM=0. As long as BATTCOM=O, the state is a standby state 501. When the shift to BATTCOM=l occurs, i.e. when the signal level on the transmission line 106 reaches a value correspond¬ing to logical "1", state 502 is reached. Referring to Figure 4, the state 502 occurs during the wake-up period 404. As long as BATTCOM=l, the state remains.<br>
When the shift to BATTCOM=0 occurs, state 503 is reached. Referring to Figure 4, this situation occurs when the shift specifying the beginning of the first start bit 304 in a transmitted byte 401 occurs. When this state is reached, a hardware timer is initiated and started. It is noted that the hardware timer which is located in the battery 103 is not illustrated in the figure but may for example be included in the micro-controller 114. Hereaf¬ter the state 504 is reached. This state remains as long as BATTCOM=0, i.e. for a time interval equal to the width (time) of the first start bit. When a shift to BATTCOM=l occurs, i.e. when the shift to the second start bit 305 occurs, the state 505 is reached. The timer value is read from the hardware timer and stored in the memory 116, and state 506 is reached.<br>
In state 506 the stored timer value and the hardware timer are used for synchronizing the reception of the re¬maining bits of the transmitted byte and, if one or more bytes are to be transmitted from the battery 103 to the electronic device 102 in response, for transmitting these bytes. Hereafter, the state 507 is reached. If the commu-<br><br><br>
nications sequence is not finished, the .state 502 is reached, i.e. waiting for a first start bit to occur. On the other hand, if the communications sequence is fin¬ished, the state 508 is reached. As long as BATTCOM=l, this state remains. When the shift to BATTCOM=0 occurs, state 501 is reached.<br>
As mentioned, said synchronizing can be performed using a timer which, as a result of the continuous synchroniza¬tion and the consequently lower requirement for permanent stability of the oscillating frequency, can be clocked by means of a simple, low cost oscillator. The oscillator may e.g. be an RC oscillator. Therefore, the battery 103 can be produced without expensive crystals, which is of interest when cost optimizing the production of batteries and electronic devices including batteries.<br>
Preferably, all bytes include the start bits to be used for synchronizing the hardware timer in accordance with the received signal. But, depending on the oscillator, if is stable enough to remain synchronized for a long pe¬riod, all bytes do not necessarily have to include the start bytes for synchronizing purposes.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described and shown, the invention is not re¬stricted to it. It may also be embodied in other ways within the subject-matter defined in the following claims. For example, the number of start bits may be in-  eluded in the transmitted bytes, and therefore the syn¬chronization using the timer can be based on a larger time interval than the duration of a single bit.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method of synchronizing a second communications means in<br>
a battery attached to an electronic device to a first communications<br>
means in said electronic device,<br>
wherein bytes consisting of a number of bits are transmitted between said electronic device and said battery by means of said first and second communication means using a digital, serial communication, characterised in that<br>
a predetermined bit sequence is appended to at least some bytes prior to the transmission from said first communications means to said second communications means,<br>
said bit sequence is detected in the signal received by said second communications means,<br>
the time interval between given shifts in the detected bit sequence is measured, and said synchronization is performed by means of said measured time interval.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said appended bit sequence is transmitted prior to the transmission of the remaining bits in said byte, and said synchronization is performed prior to receiving said remaining bits.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said bit sequence<br>
has two bits of different values, and said time interval is specified by a<br><br><br>
shift defining the beginning of the first bit and a shift between said two bits.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein everyone of said bytes has said appended predetermined bit sequence.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein at least one of said bytes does not have an appended predetermined bit sequence.<br>
