DETAILED DESCRIPATION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
In preferred embodiment substrate is a term used  as in materials science to describe the base material on which processing is conducted to produce new film or layers of material such as deposited coatings. These substrates are of the any materials  based on the organic  or inroganic in nature. The most common materials of the oraganic in nature are need to be protected form the deteoritation due to oxygen/ moisture is wood and the artcile made thereof;<br><br><br>
similarly, inorganic materials such as metals like ferrous or non ferrous which are easily corroded due the the conditions in mid around. Aonther group of the inorganic materials that are subject to the protection form the humidity, "salty climatic conditions is concret  materials whicn is the  medium of the construction;].<br>
In brief the detoriation of the organic and inorganic substances casued due to non protection are summarized below,<br>
In preferred embodiment corrosion means the breaking down of essential properties in a material due to chemical reactions with its surroundings. In the most common use of the word, this means a loss of electrons of metals reacting with water and oxygen. Weakening of metals is due to oxidation of the metal atoms is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This is commonly known as rust. This type of damage usually affects metallic materials, and typically produces oxide and/or salt of the original metal. Corrosion also includes the dissolution of ceramic materials and can refer to discoloration and weakening of polymersby the sun's ultraviolet light.<br>
Most structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in the air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area to produce general deterioration. While some efforts to reduce corrosion merely redirect the damage into less visible, less predictable forms, controlled corrosion treatments such as passivation and chromate-conversion will increase a material's corrosion resistance.<br>
In preferred embodiment concrete is a construction material composed of   . cement (commonly Portland cement as well as other cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag cement aggregate (generally a coarse aggregate such as gravel limestone, or granite, plus a fine aggregate such as sand), water, and chemical admixtures. The word concrete comes from the Latin word "concretus", which means "hardened" or "hard". Fire<br>
6<br><br>
Due to its low thermal conductivity, a layer of concrete is frequently used for fireproofing of steel structures.<br>
Concrete exposed to up to 100 "C is normally considered as healthy. The parts of a concrete structure that is exposed to temperatures above approximately 300 °C (dependent of water/cement ratio) will most likely get a pink color. Over approximately 600 °C the concrete will turn light grey, and over approximately 1000 °C it turns yellow-brown. One rale of thumb is to consider all pink colored concrete as damaged, and to be removed.<br>
Fire will expose the concrete to gases and liquids that can be harmful to the concrete, among other salts and acids that occur when gasses produced by fire come into contact with water.<br>
Aggregate expansion<br>
Various types of aggregate undergo chemical reactions in concrete, leading to damaging expansive phenomena. The most common are those containing reactive silica, that can react (in the presence of water} with the alkalis in concrete (K2O and Na2O, coming principally from cement). Among the more reactive mineral components of some aggregates are Opal, chalcedony, flint and strained quartz. Following the reaction (Alkali Silica Reactionor ASR), an expansive gel forms, that creates extensive cracks and damage on structural members. On the surface of concrete pavements the ASR can cause pop-outs, i.e. the expulsion of small cones (up-to 3 cm about in diameter) in correspondence of aggregate particles. When some aggregates containing dolomite are used, a dedolomitization reaction occurs where the magnesium carbonate compound reacts with hydroxyl ions and yields magnesium hydroxide and a carbonate ion. The resulting expansion.may cause destruction of the material. Far less common are pop-outs caused by the presence of pyrite, an iron sulfide that generates expansion by forming iron oxide and ettringite. Other reactions and recrysiallizations, e.g. hydration of clayminerals in some aggregates, may lead to destructive expansion as well.<br>
Sea water effects<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
7<br><br><br>
Concrete exposed to sea water is susceptible to its corrosive effects. The effects are more pronounced above the tidal zone than where the concrete is permanently submerged. In the submerged zone, magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions precipitate a layer of brucite, about 30 micrometers thick, on which a slower deposition of calcium carbonate as aragonite occurs. These layers somewhat protect the concrete from other processes, which include attack by magnesium, chloride and sulfate ions and carbonation. Above the water surface, mechanical damage may occur by erosion by waves themselves or sand.and gravel they carry, and by crystallization of salts from water soaking into the concrete pores and then drying up. Pozzolanic cements and cements using more than 60% of slag as aggregate are more resistant to sea water than pure Portland cement.<br>
Bacterial corrosion<br>
Bacteria themselves do not have noticeable effect on concrete. However, anaerobic bacteria Thiobacillus in untreated sewage tend to produce hydrogen sulfide, which is then oxidized by aerobic bacteria present in biofilm on the concrete surface above the water level to sulfuric acid which dissolves the carbonates in the cured cement and causes strength loss. Concrete floors lying on ground that contains pyrite are also at risk. Using limestone as the aggregate makes the concrete more resistant to acids, and the sewage may be pretreated by ways increasing pH or oxidizing or precipitating the sulfides in order to inhibit the activity of sulfide utilizing bacteria.<br>
Chemical damage<br>
Carbonation<br>
Carbonation-initiated deterioration of concrete Carbon dioxide from air can react with the calcium hydroxide in concrete to form calcium carbonate. This process is called carbonation, which is essentially the-reversal of-the chemical process of calcination of lime taking place in a cement kiln, Carbonation of concrete is a slow and continuous process progressing from the outer surface inward, but slows down with increasing diffusion depth. Carbonation has two<br>
8<br><br>
effects: it increases mechanical strength of concrete, hut it also decreases alkalinity, which is essential for corrosion prevention of the reinforcement steel. Below a pH of 10. the steel's thin layer of surface passivation dissolves and corrosion is promoted. For the latter reason, carbon;-*lion is ;tn unwanted process in concrete chemistry. Carbonation can !&gt;e tested by applying Phenolphthalein solution, a pH indicator, over a fresh fracture surface, which indicates non-carbonated and thus alkaline areas with a violet color.<br>
Chlorides<br>
Chlorides, particularly calcium chloride, have been used to shorten the setting time of concrete. However, calcium chloride and (to a lesser extent) sodium chloride have been shown to leach calcium hydroxide and cause chemical changes in Portland cement, leading to loss of strength, as well as attacking the<br>
steel reinforcement present in most concrete.<br>
Sulphates<br>
Sulphates in solution in contact with concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the cement binder.<br>
Leaching<br>
Leaching is a self healing of cracks with chemical process in concrete.<br>
Physical damage<br>
Damage can occur during the castinr and de-shuttcring processes. The corners of beams for instance, can be damaged during the removal of shuttering because they are less effectively compacted by means of vibration (improved by using form-vibrators). Other physical damage can be caused by the use of steel shuttering without "base plates. The steel shuttering pinches the top surface of a concrete slab due to the weight of the next slab being constructed.<br>
Decaying of woods<br>
9<br><br>
Damage to wood frame buildings by mildew, mold, staining, and decay is easily<br>
preventable. It is usually caused by design flaws, poor workmanship, and or<br>
neglected maintenance.<br>
Microorganisms cause mildew, mold, staining, and decay, they belong to a huge<br>
group of primitive plants called fungi. Fungi have four growth requirements<br>
similar to our basic human needs: food, water, air, and a satisfactory<br>
temperature. Decay will be prevented if any one of the four requirements is<br>
removed. The most effective way to prevent fungal deterioration is to keep the<br>
area drv.<br>
SYMPTOMS OF WATER INFILTRATION<br>
Mildew<br>
Exterior mildews often appear on unheated projecting parts of buildings such<br>
as eaves that cool quickly after sunset causing dew to form. North facing walls<br>
and walls shaded by trees and other obstructions that restrict sunlight and<br>
airflow are also candidates. While mildew won't grow where siding crosses stiids<br>
and other thermal bridges, mildew may thrive over the cooler, insulated bays<br>
between studs, where dew persists to provide the needed moisture. These<br>
mildews are easily removed with a chlorine and detergent, solution.<br>
Mold<br>
Molds need a surface moisture content of about 20% to get started. Molds tend<br>
to be a discoloration on the surface of wood. Discoloration aside, molds<br>
generally have little effect on wood's integrity. Prevention lies wholly in<br>
controlling air moisture levels and condensation through proper site drainage<br>
and ventilation.<br>
Staining Fungi<br>
Staining fungi is found almost exclusively in freshly sawn lumber. If not<br>
treated, or if the moisture content is not reduced to an intolerable level, this<br>
fungi can destroy certain wood cells leaving the wood susceptible to decay.<br>
Decay Fungi (Dry Rot)<br>
While discoloration by mildew, mold, and staining fungi is only an appearance<br>
problem, deear-fungus threatens the structural integrity of wood"."Suitably<br>
termed the "slow fire", these fungi eat the very cellulose of which wood cells are<br>
made. Decay fungi are what we commonly call dry rot, even though it is caused<br><br><br><br><br>
by water. Moisture content is the critical factor that makes wood susceptible to decay. It must exceed 28%, and liquid water must be present in cell cavities before decay fungi can gain a toehold. Once established, some fungi can carry on their destruction at a moisture content as low as 20%. When moisture content falls below this level, all fungal activity stops. Thai's one reason why framing lumber is dried to 19% moisture content or less.<br>
It doesn't take a trained eye to recognize decay in its advanced stages. Wood is visibly discolored, spongy, and musty. Surfaces may be stringy, shrunken, or split across the grain. Decay extends deep into the wood and strength loss is significant. Before repainting the exterior or interior of your house, look for evidence of mildew or mold on the wall surfaces. Remove mildew or mold with an application of a bleach and water mixture. When you purchase your house -    paint, have a mildicide added to the the paint or purchase the mildicide at your local paint store and add it to the paint.<br>
Hence, in order to avoid the loss due the to the corrosion of the metals and detonation of the wood the coating composition of the present invention are designed.<br>
Epoxy resin based formulations are marked by the drawback of the powdery in nature which are at the time of application need to be dissolved in suitable   ' vehicle.<br>
For the application of the epoxy resins are need to be mixed with the polyacrylate material, and the composition formed such is need to fully utilized -    at the one stretch, which is not possible to store, it becomes it becomes hard after mixing, such property of the epoxy resins is limiting factor for. the preparation of the coating compositions or adhesion compositions.<br>
Due to its powdery in nature it make it very difficult to achieve results with the consistenc3', film formed due to such deposition also non continuous, due to such reasons epoxy resins arc less popular,<br>
The common ingredients of the present coating composition is as discussed below,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
11<br><br><br>
Epoxy or polyepoxide is a thermosetting epoxide polymer that cures (polymerizes and crosslinks) when mixed wiih a catalyzing agent or hardener. In Preferred embodiment epoxy resins are selected  from between epichlorohydrin and bisphenol-A or other known epoxy resins either sysnethic or natural in origen.<br>
The coating dries quickly providing a tough, UV resistant, protective coating wiih excellent ultimate hardness, and good mar and abrasion resistance. They arc designed for rapid dry protective coating applications. Ambient cure epoxy coatings provide excellent physical properties in exterior applications. These products have excellent adhesion to various metal substrates. Their low VOC and water clean up makes them a natural choice for factory cast iron, cast steel, cast aluminum applications and reduces exposure and flammability issues associated with solventborne coatings. They are usually used for industrial and automotive uses as they are high heat resistant (as latex-based and alkyd-based paints usually burn, thus peel, with slight high heat temperatures).<br>
Polyester Epoxies are used as powder coatings for washers, driers and other "white goods". Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), concrete reinforcing rebar et cetera. Epoxy coatings arc also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for high performance and decorative flooring applications especially terrazzo flooring, chip flooring and colored aggregate flooring.<br>
In preferred embodiment-polyester Resin refers to unsaturated resins formed by the reaction of dibasic organic acids and polyhydric alcohols. Among other uses, it is the basic component of SMC/BMC.<br><br><br>
Unsaturated polyesters are condensation polymers formed by the reaction of polyols (also known as polyhydric alcohols, organic compounds with multiple alcohol or hydroxy functional groups) and polycarboxylic that contain double bonds. Typical polyols used are glycols such as ethylene glycol. The usual polycarboxylic acids used are phthalic acid and malcie acid.<br>
Unsaturated polyesters differ from saturated polyesters such as polyethylene lerephthalate which constitutes the polyester films and fibers of commerce in that acids or glycols having double bond unsaturation are included in the formula to provide reactive olefinic unsaturation in the unsaturated polyester alkyd.<br>
Polyester resins are thermosetting; "thermosetting" means the plastic softens when initially heated, but sets permanently rigid once it has cooled (as opposed to "thermoplastics", which re-soften with heat). Polyester resin is often purchased in liquid form for the production of glass-reinforced plastic. In this case, a catalyst (typically methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) (also known as butanone peroxide) is used to initiate the polymerization reaction; benzoyl peroxide is a somewhat less hazardous alternative suitable for some purposes.<br>
Epoxy matting Hardener D68 is the salts of polycarboxylic acid with cyclic amidine. The hardener, applied in suitable formulations can produce epoxy or Hybrid coatings for matt or semi-matt gloss with very good flowing and properties. Variation between matt and semi-matt surface can be obtained by-means of suitable adjustment of formulation.<br>
Hybrid coating with matt or semi-matt gloss may be achieved by replacing some of the polyester in the formulation with an equivalent quantity of D68.The following gives the formulations of hardeners for matt epoxy coatings<br>

D68 is a leveling agent with silica carrier available from. It's noted that the achievement of matt effect and relevant puppetries of .the film is connected with full cured of coatings.<br>
Benzoin or 2-Hydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone or 2-Hydroxy-l ,2-Diphenyle than one or desyl alcohol or bitter almond oil camphor is an organic compound consisting of an ethylene bridge flanked by phenyl groups and with a hydroxyl and a ketone functional group. It comes as off-white crystals, with a light camphor odor. Benzoin is used as photoinitiotor in the paint compositions.<br>
Hydrogenated Castor Oil Based Rheology Modifiers it is used in the paint composition mainly for the purpose,<br>
•	Sedimentation: During storage, the coating must develop a very high viscosity in order to effectively suppress settling of pigments and extenders.<br>
•	Coating Application: The coating viscosity must be sufficiently low for ease of application by conventional methods e.g. brushes, roller and spray.<br><br><br>
• Levelling: Once applied, the coating must exhibit the correct rheological characteristic so that sag resistance is maximised without detriment to the surface levelling process.<br>
The coating film is now subjected to the low shear conditions of gravity. Here it is desirable that the film remains in place during the drying process and also that a high degree of surface levelling be obtained. In order to effectively address sag resistance and surface levelling at the same time, the coating system must exhibit a time dependent viscosity recovery, a process known as thixotropic recovery. This is where the viscosity of the coating film increases in a time dependent manner back towards its low shear value. The increase in viscosity suppresses sagging while the time dependent aspect allows sufficient time for effective levelling. If this time dependent viscosity recovery is too rapid, the coating will essentially behave in a pseudoplastic manner. While this will result in excellent sag resistance, the result will be poor surface levelling with any application textures such as brush marks permanently frozen in as a feature of the dried film. Consequently, shear thinning rheology combined with time dependent thixotropic viscosity recovery is a feature highly sought after for most coatings.<br>
There is a wide range of rheology modifiers available to the formulator e.g. silicas, organo-clays, organo-waxes, polyethylene waxes and various surfactants.<br>
Unfortunately, most of these exhibit very little time dependence following application i.e. they tend more towards a pseudoplastic rather than the well balanced thixotropic rheology. Hydrogenated castor oil based rheology modifiers are one particular group of rheology.<br>
in pi cferred embodiment polyacrylate polymer with silica is used to improve the UV-shielding and water-resistance properties of many emulsion-type latexes, poly (styrene-butylacrylate-acrylic acid) (PSBA)-grafted-silica (PSBA-g-silica) hybrid nanoparticles.The influence of PSBA-g-silica hybrid nanoparticles on the interfacial adhesion.-film morphology,-thermodynamics properties, UV-shielding, water-re si stance and mechanical performance of PSBA films were investigated systematically.
