				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a coffee/tea making machine.<br>
The machine proposed herein can make coffee or tea, or both? depending upon requirements.<br>
When coffee is to foe made, coffee powder is to used. When tea is to made, tea dust or even tea leaves may be used .<br>
The coffee/tea making machine, according to this invention, comprises at least one decoction dispenser-provided with a warmeheater and thermostat for keeping the decoction hot at. the desired temperature; first valve means provided for the said dispenser for discharging a predetermined quantity of the hot decoction from the said dispenser to at least. one warmer tank; second valve means provided for the warmer-tank which, on actuation, dispense a metered quantity of the hot decoction therefrom to at. least one mixer, the first valve means discharging a metered quantity of hot  decoction from the dispenser to the  warmer  tank,<br><br>
whenever the second valve means is actuated, to replenish the warmer tank each time; at least one canister containing whitener, said canister being provided with a motor -for delivering a predetermined quantity of whitener to the mixer whenever the second valve means is actuated, whereby the decoction and whitener are mixed together in the mixer and dispensed as hot co-ffee/tea through at. least, one delivery outlet for being collected thereat, in a receptacle.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference	to<br>
the  accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way	o-f<br>
example, one of the various possible embodiments of	the<br>
machine proposed herein.<br>
Fig 1. illustrating  a  perspective  view   of   the<br>
embodiment <opened></opened>
Fig   2.  illustrating  a  perspective  view   of   the<br>
embodiment (closed)<br>
Fig  3. illustrating an exploded view of the  dispenser<br>
in the form of a percolator<br><br>
and<br>
Fig 4. illustrating a separate view of the warmer tank with heater.<br>
The machine proposed herein comprises a decoction dispenser. The said dispenser can consist either of a container for receiving, storing and dispensing hot decoction made outside the machine or an electrically operated percolator P for preparing the decoction in the machine itself.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, the said dispenser consists of an electrically operated percolator P comprising a water container C provided with a thermostat T and a heater K. An exploded view of the percolator is shown in Fig 3, The percolator has a filter F in which coffee powder/tea dust/tea leaf is deposited.<br>
The water in the container C is heated by the heater K. As  the water is heated, the hot water  passes  through<br><br>
the  dispensing tube Jfinto the filter F  to  come  into intimate  contact with the coffee  powder/tea  dust/tea leaf  therein to yield a decoction which  travels  down into the container C through the filter. The  procedure repeats, until the container has strong  decoction of coffee/tea in it.<br>
After the decoction reaches a desired temperature the thermostat T provided for the percolator switches off the heater K. Simultaneously, a warmer heater H provided for the? percolator keeps the decoction in the container C at a desired temperature so that the decoction does not lose its flavour or aroma by turning cold. At the same time first valve means such as a solenoid valve provided for the percolator at VI open and then close to enable a predetermined quantity of the decoction in the container C to be discharged into a warmer tank W.<br>
The warmer tank W has a warmer heater E for keeping the decoction discharged into it at the desired temperature.<br><br>
Second valve means such as a solenoid valve are provided for the warmer tank W at V2. The said valve means, on being actuated, by the user, dispense a metered quantity of the hot decoction into a power driven mixer M. Each time the second valve means open and then close, over an interval, to dispense hot decoction from the warmer tank to the mixer, the first valve means also open and then close, over an interval, to dispense a similar quantity of hot decoction from the percolator P to the warmer tank W to replenish the same. Simultaneously, whitener (a mixture of milk powder and sugar powder) in the canister Q is discharged, in a predetermined quantity by an ingredient motor, into the mixer M. The decoction and whitener now thoroughly mixed in the mixer are discharged through the delivery tube D in the form of hot liquid coffee through the delivery outlet at 0 to be collected in a cup placed over the perforated drain cover L.<br>
Preferably,   the   initial   quantity   of   decoction<br><br>
discharged from the percolator to the warmer tank will be sufficient to make several cups of coffee/tea. However, subsequent quantities of decoction discharged from the percolator to the warmer tank from time, through the first valve means, as the second valve means go into operation from time to time, will be sufficient to replenish the latter.<br>
In another embodiment, as already stated above, the decoction dispenser will comprise only the container C, without heater K, filter F, dispenser tube N and thermostat T. There will, however, be the warmer heater H with thermostat. The hot decoction will be prepared outside the machine and then poured into the container C. The container C will be provided with a lid to cover it. Once the hot decoction is poured into the container C the warmer heater H will be switched on and the first valve means go into operation, as already explained above, the sequence of operations being otherwise the same.<br>
The  machine proposed herein c&amp;n   make either coffee  or<br><br>
tea in the manner described. However, if both coffee and tea are to be prepared separately or if the capacity o-f the machine is to be increased, a plurality of percolators (or containers C of the second embodiment, as the case may be), warmer tanks and mixers will be provided. The canister Q can however be common or, in the alternative, a plurality o-f canisters will be? provided.<br>
In the embodiment discussed, by way of example, three push button switches Zl Z2 Z3 are provided. The first switch Zl gives a green glow when the hot decoction first leaves the container C and enters the warmer tank, indicating that the machine is ready. The second switch Z2 gives out a yellow glow requiring the user to operate it to start the coffee/tea marking operation. The third switch Z3*gives out a red glow when the whole operation is over and decoction is used up.<br>
Where the machine is intended to make both coffee and tea,  there will be two switches in the place  of  the single  switch  Z2,  identified  by  colour  codes   or<br><br>
nomenclature, whereby coffee or tea can be selected.<br>
Both  -first  and second valve means are     controlled	by<br>
electronic timer means whereby the said valves open	and<br>
close over preset durations of time to discharge	the<br>
desired quantities of decoction.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification a.re o-f description and not of limitation there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the machine proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br>
