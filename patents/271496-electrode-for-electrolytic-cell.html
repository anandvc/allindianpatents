ELECTRODE FOR ELECTROLYTIC CELL<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an electrode for electrochemical processes for the<br>
production of gases such as chlorine from aqueous alkali halide solutions, which in the<br>
assembled state is positioned parallel and opposite to an ion-exchange membrane and<br>
consists of a multitude of horizontal lamellar elements. The lamellar elements are<br>
structured and three-dimensionally shaped, part of the surface thereof being in direct<br>
contact with the membrane, and are provided with grooves and holes, wherein the<br>
majority of the holes is located in the grooves and the overall surface area of such<br>
holes or part thereof is located in the grooves or extends therein. Preferably the holes<br>
are located in the contact area of the relevant lamellar element with the membrane.<br>
[0002] Gas-producing electrochemical processes and the corresponding electrodes to<br>
be used in electrolytic appliances are known in the art; such electrodes are for instance<br>
disclosed in DE 198 16 334. The above patent describes an electrolyser for the<br>
generation of halogen gases from aqueous alkali halide solutions. As the product gas<br>
in the electrolyte negatively affects the flow behavior in the membrane/electrode area,<br>
DE 198 16 334 suggests the installation of individual louver-type elements inclined to<br>
the horizontal plane. In this way a lateral flow is established in the cell because the gas<br>
bubbles gathering under the individual lamellar elements run upwards through the<br>
openings.<br>
[0003] DE 198 16 334 however does not suggest how to overcome the problem that a<br>
certain amount of gas gets trapped underneath the louver-type elements, so that a<br>
considerable fraction of the membrane surface area is blinded. The fluid circulation is<br>
hindered in the blinded area, in which the gas production cannot therefore take place.<br>
Moreover, the gas stagnation diminishes the local membrane conductivity, leading to<br>
an increase in the current density in the remaining zones, which in turn leads to<br>
increased cell voltage and energy consumption.<br>
[0004] In order to eliminate this blinding effect, EP 0 095 039 discloses lamellar<br>
elements provided with transverse recesses. In DE 44 15 146 however it is stated that<br>
said recesses are insufficient to prevent blinding. Consequently DE 44 15 146<br>
discloses lamellar elements provided with bores or openings pointing downwards so<br>
that the gas discharge flow is enhanced.<br>
[0005] However, this method does not solve the problem of the residual gas fraction<br>
trapped in correspondence of the contact areas and hindering the electrolyte flow.<br><br>
2<br>
[0006] It is therefore one of the objects of the present invention is to provide an<br>
electrode overcoming said deficiency, preventing or minimizing the blinding<br>
phenomena.<br>
[0007] This and other objects of the present invention which will be made clear by the<br>
following description are achieved by an electrode according to the appended claim 1.<br>
The electrode according to the invention for use in electrolysers for gas-producing<br>
electrochemical processes is arranged parallel and opposite to an ion-exchange<br>
membrane in the installed state and consists of a multiplicity of structured and three-dimensionally <br>
shaped horizontal lamellar elements.<br>
[0008] Part of the surface of the lamellar elements is in direct contact with the<br>
membrane, and said elements are provided with at least one groove, extending into the<br>
surface portion of the lamellar element in direct contact with the membrane, said at<br>
least one groove being provided in its turn with at least one hole. Preferably, the<br>
lamellar elements are provided with a multiplicity of grooves and a multiplicity of holes,<br>
the major part of the holes being located in the grooves, so that at least part of the hole<br>
surface is located in the grooves or extends into the same.<br>
[0009] In a particularly preferred embodiment the holes are arranged in the contact<br>
area of the respective lamellar element with the membrane. Even more preferably, the<br>
grooves provided with holes are disposed on the side facing the membrane, and are<br>
free of obstacles to the flow. As the electric current takes the path of least resistance,<br>
the electrode has an essential advantage that on the one hand the region subjected to<br>
the highest current density, i.e. the contact area, is supplied with an ideal escape for<br>
the downward stream of fluid via the groove, and on the other hand the much more<br>
voluminous product gas is conveyed upwards via the groove or via the holes to the rear<br>
side of the electrode.<br>
[0010] Moreover, it was found that positioning the holes in the grooves is an ideal<br>
solution because the smallest membrane-electrode gap can be established in the<br>
contact area without the holes being closed by the superposition with the membrane,<br>
with a partial or complete obstruction of the fluid feed.<br>
[0011] It was also possible to determine that such hole position is optimal because the<br>
complete internal surface area of the hole acts as an active electrode surface on<br>
account of the close vicinity of the membrane. If a hole diameter smaller than the<br><br>
3<br>
thickness of the sheet is selected, all of the holes effectively contribute to the<br>
enlargement of the overall active electrode surface.<br>
[0012] In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, two or more holes are<br>
arranged in a groove in the contact area with the membrane.<br>
[0013] In a particular embodiment of the invention the lamellar elements are shaped as<br>
a sickle consisting of two flanks linked by an arched transitional area. The arched<br>
section points towards the membrane and both flanks are inclined at an angle of 10<br>
degrees to the membrane.<br>
[0014] In a preferred embodiment of the invention the individual lamellar elements are<br>
shaped as a flat C-profile from an initially slightly convex section, which in the installed<br>
state is parallel to the membrane. Upon installation the two or more flank parts are<br>
inclined at least 10 degrees to the membrane. One or several transitional portions with<br>
any profile are arranged between the slightly convex part and the flank parts.<br>
Advantageously the transitional areas are formed as rounded edges.<br>
[0015] The surface areas of the lamellar element in accordance with the invention are<br>
characterised by the parameter FV1 which is the ratio between the contact surface and<br>
the free active surface area, according to the formula<br>
FV1 = (F2 + F3) / (F1 + F4 + F5)<br>
wherein:<br>
F1 is the groove surface area in the F2 portion,<br>
F2 is the strip-type contact area with the membrane,<br>
F3 is the transitional area from the strip-type contact area to the groove wall,<br>
F4 is the surface area of hole wall and<br>
F5 is the surface area of groove walls in F2 portion.<br>
[0016] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, FV1 is lower than 0.5, more<br>
preferably lower than 0.15. The sheet thickness in the region of the holes is greater<br>
than 30% of the hydraulic diameter of the holes. The hydraulic diameter is defined as<br>
the ratio between the quadrupled surface area and the perimeter of the free flow cross<br>
section, which in case of circular holes is equivalent to the geometric diameter. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment the sheet thickness in the region of the recesses<br>
does not exceed 50 % of the above mentioned hydraulic diameter.<br><br>
4<br>
[0017] The holes of the electrode in accordance with the invention may have a shape<br>
of any kind, for instance they can be advantageously shaped as thin slots with a width<br>
smaller than 1.5 mm.<br>
[0018] A preferred embodiment of the electrode of this invention provides that the<br>
groove depth be limited in order to obtain groove walls and bases as active electrode<br>
surfaces better suited for the reaction while keeping the fluid resistance not too high,<br>
said depth being smaller than 1 mm or more preferably smaller than 0.5 mm, or even<br>
more preferably not higher than 0.3 mm.<br>
[0019] Moreover, in a preferred embodiment the ratio FV2 between the total surface of<br>
the contact area and the total surface of the area not coming in contact with the<br>
membrane is set smaller than 1 or more preferably smaller than 0.5 and even more<br>
preferably smaller than 0.2. FV2 is defined as follows:<br>
FV2 = F6 / (F1 + F2)<br>
wherein F1 and F2 are the above defined values representing the projected surface of<br>
the contact area and F6 represents the flank surface area of the lamellar element<br>
directly facing the membrane, said flank surface being inclined away and not coming in<br>
contact with the membrane.<br>
[0020] Under another aspect, the invention is directed to an electrolytic process for the<br>
production of a halogen gas from aqueous alkali halide solutions, said process being<br>
implemented by means of electrodes of the invention or by means of electrolysers<br>
using such electrodes.<br>
[0021] In a preferred embodiment, the above-mentioned electrolytic process for<br>
halogen gas production makes use of electrolysers of the single-cell type of filter-press<br>
design, incorporating the electrode of the invention as an essential component<br>
[0022] The invention is described hereinafter with the aid of the attached drawings<br>
which are provided by way of example and shall not be intended as a limitation of the<br>
scope thereof, wherein fig. 1a is a perspective view of the electrode of the invention,<br>
fig. 1b is a detail thereof, figs. 2a and 2b show the lamellar element in detail, fig. 3<br>
shows a lamellar element having a flat C-type profile, fig. 4 is a side-view of the<br>
lamellar element of fig. 3.<br>
[0023] Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of the electrode of the invention represented as<br>
three parallel lamellar elements 1 provided with grooves 2 and strip-type surfaces 3<br><br>
5<br>
therebetween. In this particular example, a hole 4 is positioned in every other groove 2<br>
crossing the lamellar element 1 from the front side, corresponding to the visible<br>
surface, to the rear side.<br>
[0024] As represented in detail in Fig. 1b the lamellar elements 1 consist of two flank<br>
elements, an upper flank 5 and a lower flank 6, linked by means of an arched<br>
transitional area or elbow 7. The holes 4 are exactly placed in the transitional area 7<br>
which, upon electrode installation, is positioned in the centre of the contact area 8 with<br>
the membrane 9. In this embodiment, contact area 8 almost coincides with transitional<br>
area 7 and is formed by surface areas F1 to F3, wherein F2 represents the strip-type<br>
contact area with the membrane, F1 the groove surface area in the F2 portion, and F3<br>
the transitional area from the strip-type contact surface to the groove wall.<br>
[0025] In the cross-sectional view of Fig. 2a relative to the same embodiment, the<br>
membrane 9 follows the contour of lamellar element 1 above the groove wall 10. The<br>
curvature angle 12 defines the position and width of the gap-area of membrane 9 to the<br>
lamellar element 1 and it is located between contact area 8 and area of no contact with<br>
the membrane 11. The curvature angle 12 has been chosen in the above example in<br>
such a manner that the minor radii of the elliptically extended hole circumferences end<br>
up in the above-mentioned gap area of membrane 9 to lamellar element 1. This design<br>
has the major advantage that an enlarged volume is available for the complicated gas<br>
discharge and fluid feed into the narrow groove region. The transitional area 7 in which<br>
membrane 9 is detached from the lamellar element is identified with the aid of a dotted<br>
circle.<br>
[0026] Fig. 2b depicts the same lamellar element 1 upon installation and during<br>
operation. Counter-electrode 13 faces the opposite side of the membrane 9 and both<br>
electrodes are flooded by brine or caustic (not shown) and by gas bubbles 14.<br>
Moreover, Fig. 2b shows the assembly used for chlor-alkali production wherein the<br>
anode, which in this case is the lamellar element 1 in direct contact with the membrane,<br>
faces the cathode, which in this case is the counter-electrode 13. As Fig. 2b illustrates,<br>
a gap is maintained between the membrane 9 and the cathode 13 because the caustic<br>
acting as the catholyte has a relatively good conductivity. In this example the counter-electrode <br>
13 is made of a mesh of expanded metal.<br>
[0027] Fig. 3 shows a lamellar element 1 of a flat C-type profile. The grooves 2 are<br>
sufficiently wide that the holes 4 do not cause any weakening of the groove wall 10.<br><br>
6<br>
The width of the strip-type surfaces 3 is approx. only 1/3 of the width of the grooves 2.<br>
Furthermore, backward arched flanks 5 and 6 are very short and the contact area<br>
comprising surface areas F1 to F3 is many times greater. The FV2 surface area ratio<br>
defined above is smaller than 0.2 in the case of the illustrated example. The essential<br>
advantage of this embodiment is that an active area parallel to membrane 9 is<br>
arranged between the two transitional areas 7 ensuring an ideal condition for the<br>
electrochemical reaction. The groove 2 is supplied through holes 4 with caustic or<br>
brine, dragged by the ascending gas bubbles.<br>
[0028] Fig. 4 shows the above-mentioned embodiment. As represented in Fig. 4, the<br>
portion of lamellar element not facing the membrane 9 is shielded against the<br>
ascending gas bubbles 14 by means of lower flank 6 so that the gas bubbles formed in<br>
the holes 4 are led away and caustic or brine can be dragged into the groove 2. The<br>
transitional area 7, in which membrane 9 is detached from the lamellar element, is<br>
identified with the aid of a dotted circle.<br>
[0029] The sickle-profiled lamellar elements of the invention allow an enlargement of<br>
the active electrode surface area of approx. 3.14 mm2 per hole, for a hole diameter of 2<br>
mm and a sheet thickness of 1 mm in correspondence of the groove. Hence, in the<br>
case of a standard electrolytic cell equipped with the electrodes of the invention, a 0.11<br>
m2 increase of the active surface area is obtained by means of approximately 105 000<br>
individual holes. The cell voltage of a 2.7 m2 electrode according to the invention,<br>
characterised by a sickle-type profile, was measured in a test cell. A considerable<br>
voltage decrease of more than 50 mV was detected at a current density of 6 kA/m2<br>
compared to an electrode of the prior art of equivalent external dimensions.<br><br>
