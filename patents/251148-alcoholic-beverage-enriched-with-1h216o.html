Alcoholic beverage enriched with 1H2160<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to alcoholic beverage production. More specifically, this invention relates to production of alcoholic beverage enriched with 1H2,60 by weight of water of alcoholic beverage composition, in other words alcoholic beverage with increased 1H2160 content in comparison with typical alcoholic beverage composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The quality and purity of water as a component in the composition of alcoholic beverages are one of determinative factors for life quality and human health.<br>
Water as a chemical agent is a substance consisting of water molecules. However there is no absolutely pure natural water. The natural water always contains a quantity of different suspension particles, chemical and biological admixtures. I.e. any natural water (including any drinking water) is a composition of water as a chemical agent and some other substances.<br>
The purification of water is a vital necessity today. Water purification methods depend on subsequent use of water and can be different, such as filtration, distillation, reverse osmosis and so on. The traditional water purification methods are able to eliminate only admixtures from water and have no effect on water as a chemical agent. I.e. they do not change the ratio between isotope varieties of water molecules.<br>
The molecule of water H20 consists of two chemical elements - hydrogen H and oxygen O. Either of two elements also consists of several isotopes.<br>
2<br><br>
Hereinafter:<br>
the term «hydrogen» (lettering: H) means a chemical element as a total of stable nonradioactive hydrogen isotope varieties;<br>
the term «oxygen» (lettering: O) means a chemical element as a total of stable nonradioactive oxygen isotope varieties;<br>
the natural hydrogen consists of stable nonradioactive isotopes:<br>
-	protiurn (lettering lH);<br>
-	deuterium (lettering 2H, historical symbol D, further can be used<br>
lettering 2H or equivalent lettering D).<br>
the natural oxygen consists of three stable nonradioactive isotopes:<br>
-	oxygen-16 (lettering 160),<br>
-	oxygen-17 (lettering 170),<br>
-	oxygen-18 (lettering ,80),<br>
(the present invention concerns the said stable nonradioactive isotopes only);<br>
Any water as a chemical agent is a composition of 9 isotope varieties of water molecule such as: 1H216O, 1H2170, 1H218O, 1H216O, 1H217O, 1H218O, 2H2I60,2H2I70, 2H2180 formed by stable isotopes of hydrogen - 1H, 2H, and stable isotopes of oxygen - 160, l70, I80. The other name for these isotope varieties of water molecule is isotopologues.<br>
The term «isotopologue» is defined in accordance with IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition (1997) and refers to a molecular entity that differs only in isotopic composition (number of isotopic substitutions), e.g. 1H216O, 1H217O, 1H218O, Herein and after the terms «isotope varieties of water molecule» and «isotopologue» are used as convertible terms.<br>
3<br><br>
The content of water isotopologues in Ocean Water is stated as the internationally accepted water standard VSMOW. In Ocean Water the level of 1H216O molecules comprising light isotopes !H and 16O is 99.731% (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, VSMOW), and about 0.2683% of the Ocean Water is formed by water molecules comprising heavy isotopes 2H, 170, 180 (0.0372% 1H216O, 0.199983% 1H2180, 0.031069% 1H2H 160, and etc.) (Rothman et al., J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 1998, 60, 665. Rothman et al., J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 2003, 82, p.9). The abundance of water isotopologues in natural water varies depending on Earth regions and climate conditions and is typically expressed as the deviation, 5, relative to the VSMOW standard. The natural water with maximum content of light water isotopologue lH2l60 was found in Antarctica (Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation, SLAP), wherein said 8-values of residual heavy isotopes are 82H = -415.5°/oo, 8170 = -28.1%o, and 5180 = -53.9% that corresponds to the 99.757 % level of light water isotopologue 1H2I60 (R. van Trigt, Laser Spectrometry for Stable Isotope Analysis of Water Biomedical and Paleoclimatological Applications, 2002, Groningen: University Library Groningen, p. 50).<br>
Thus, natural water with the abundance of light water isotopologue lH2160 more than 99.757% is not found in nature.<br>
In natural water the residual concentration of the molecules, comprising 2H, 170, 180 heavy isotopes, such as 1H2I70, 1H218O, lH2H16O, lH2H18O, lH2H16O, 2H2160,2H2170,2H2,80 can amount to 2.97 g/1.<br>
Since total levels of deuterium-comprising isotopologues in water is rather more 0.3 g/1 (0.031%) (Rothman et al., J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 1998, 60, 665. Rothman et al, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 2003, 82, p.9) a complete depletion of natural water of deuterium-comprising<br>
4<br><br>
isotopologues provides water with the level of light water isotopologue 1H2I60 no more than 99.76%.<br>
Thus, water with abundance of light water isotopologue 1H2I60 more than 99.76% is unknown from the art.<br>
Method and apparatus for production of the water with abundance of 1H2160 light water isotopologue more than 99.76% are also unknown from the art.<br>
As mentioned above, in typical natural water the residual concentration of molecules, comprising 2H, 170, 180 heavy isotopes can amount to 2.97 g/1 by weight. In nature the less concentration of molecules, comprising lH2H17O, l80 heavy isotopes, was found in Antarctica and corresponds to the 99.757 % level of light water isotopologue 1H2160.<br>
Heavy isotopes-comprising molecules in mammal organism can lead to a change of normal biochemical processes and to a decrease of functional resources of the organism.<br>
There is the barest necessity to increase the content of light water molecules of 1H2160 in human organism, and to decrease the content of 1H2170, 1H2180, 1H2H,60, 1H2H,70, 1H2H180, 2H2160, 2H2,70, 2H2180 molecules, that lead to improving of human wellness and life quality.<br>
The content of isotope varieties of water molecule such as: 1H2160, 1H2170,   1H2H160, 1H2H170, 1H2H180, 2H2160,2H2170, 2H2180 in human organism directly depend on the content of said isotope varieties of water molecule in drinking water and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, used by human.<br>
An alcoholic beverage with abundance of light water isotopologue 1H2160 more than 99.76% unknown from the art.<br>
5<br><br>
Moreover, alcoholic liver disease is a health problem in the world. It has been estimated that about 90 to 100 % of heavy drinkers show evidence of fatty liver, about 10 to 35 % develop alcoholic hepatitis, and 8 to 20 % develop cirrhosis. Lelbach WK., Epidemiology of alcoholic liver disease. In: Popper H et al., eds. Progress in liver disease, vol.5, NY: Grune and Statton, 1976: 494-515.<br>
Thus, there is a great need for a safe, effective ingredient for lowering ethanol toxicity in alcoholic beverages with little or no effect on consumer properties of the beverages.<br>
Unexpectedly, we discovered that alcohol in alcoholic composition comprising water with abundance of light water isotopologue 1H2160 more than 99.16% has considerably reduced toxic effect.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an alcoholic beverage comprising water with abundance of light water isotopologue 1H2160 more than 99.76%.<br>

First component (A) - highly pure light water<br>
According to the present invention it is possible to produce water enriched with 1H2l60 in an amount more than 99.76 % and up to about 99.99% by weight of water. Water can be purified not only of typical chemicals and admixtures, but also of molecules, such as: 1H2,70, 1H2180, 1H2H160, 1H2H170, 1H2H,180, 2H2160, 2H2170, 2H2180, which can amount up to 2.97 g/1 and are a kind of admixtures concerning main component of water, which is 1H2160. As a result, the water becomes isotope homogenous substance consisting of 1H2160 in an amount up to 99.99 %, in other words, light water. This light water is a pure water to a greater extent than any other purified water with typical isotope composition, it is highly pure light water. Thus, one can reach a qualitatively new and higher level of the water purity.<br>
Thus, highly pure light water is a composition comprising from about 99.76 % to about 99.99% of WO and residual amounts of lH217O, lH218O 1H2H16O, lH217O, 1H2H18O, 2H2160,2H2170, 2H2180 up to 100% correspondingly.<br>
For practicing the invention we offer a method and apparatus for production of highly pure light water.<br>
Highly pure light water comprising more than 99.76 % of light isotopologue 1H2160 is prepared by distillation of typical water with typical content 1H2160 with using the apparatus of FIG.l. It is prepared by methods providing simultaneous depletion from typical water of 8 isotope varieties of<br>
water molecules comprising heavy isotopes H,    O, and   O such as: H2 O, lH217O, lH218O 1H2H16O, lH217O, 1H2H18O, 2H216O,2H217O, 2H218O.<br>
9<br><br>
The process of the distillation includes:<br>
-	evaporating natural water comprising [C1] of light isotopologue 1H2160 in boiling (see FIG 1,1) to produce water vapor;<br>
-	supplying the water vapor to the bottom (2) of distillation column (3);<br>
-	carrying out vapor-liquid contact between a descending liquid and an ascending vapor mainly on the surface of the contact device (4) (e.g. structured or random packing) within the distillation column, simultaneously the liquid and the vapor flow in mutually opposite directions over the surface of the contact device along the main flow direction which is the direction of the column axis;<br>
-	condensing water vapor with concentration of light isotopologue 1H2I60 [C2] on condenser (5) installed on the top of the distillation column;<br>
- collecting a part of condensate as condensed highly pure light water comprising the increased content (more than 99.76 %) of light isotopologue 1H2160[C2&gt;C1].<br>
After respective treatment one can get highly pure light water which is drinking water, distilled water, deionized water, reverse osmosis water, ultra-pure water, etc. These types of water differ by concentration of chemical substances, but it always comprises more than 99.76% of light isotopologue<br>

Water is the essential component of all biological systems. The functions of water are not limited to the role of the medium where the biochemical processes and diffusion of the metabolites take place. Water takes direct part in chemical reactions, structurization and stabilization of the molecules of the biopolymers and permolecular systems that provides their conformational mobility, and also in the osmoregulation and the transport of nutrients.<br>
As mentioned above, light and heavy water isotopologues have distinct properties in biological system. For example, heavy water isotopologues decrease the rate of biochemical reactions, disturb conformational mobility of the molecules of biopolymers (Chervenak et al. JACS, 1994, 116 (23): 10533-10539. Makhatadze et al., Nature Struct. Biol., 1995, 2 (10): 852-855. Connelly et al., PNAS, 1994, 91: 1964-1968. Cupane et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1980, 8 (18): 4283-4303). Thus, heavy isotopes-comprising molecules in mammal organism decrease of functional resources of the organism.<br>
16<br><br>
As mention above, the content of isotope varieties of water molecule such as: 1H2160, 1H2,70, 1H2,80, 1H2H,60, 1H2H,70, 1H2H,80, 2H2160, 2H2I70, 2H2I80 in human organism directly depends on the content of said isotope varieties of water molecule in drinking water and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, used by human. Thus, it is more preferably the taking of an alcoholic beverages enriched with 1H2160 prepared on the base of highly pure light water in accordance with present invention.<br>
Furthermore, unexpectedly, we discovered that water enriched with ,H2160 in an amount no less than 99.76% is effective and safe ingredient for lowering ethanol toxicity in alcohol compositions. These conclusions are confirmed our experiments performed on mice (example N° 2).<br>
Thus, in the present invention alcoholic beverage enriched with !H2160 comprises highly pure light water with content of 1H2160 from about 99.76% to about 99.99%, which is the effective ingredient for lowering ethanol toxicity of alcoholic compositions without decrease of the main consumer properties of alcoholic beverages. Moreover, alcoholic beverages enriched with 1H2I60 in an amount no less than 99.76% by weight of water of alcoholic beverage are beverages with best quality, because they offer all advantages of light water.<br>
Alcoholic beverages enriched with 1H2160 in an amount no less than 99.76% by weight of water of alcoholic beverage, which are obtained by the present invention, are a new product which has not been produced up to this time.<br>
The following examples are presented to demonstrate the invention. The examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
17<br><br>
Example 1<br>
This example demonstrates the method for producing highly pure light water of the invention.<br>

-	evaporating natural water comprising 99.70%o [C1] of light isotopologue 1H2I60 in boiling (see Fig 1,1) to produce water vapor;<br>
-	supplying the water vapor to the bottom (2) of distillation column (3);<br>
-	carrying out vapor-liquid contact between a descending liquid and an ascending vapor mainly on the surface of the contact device (4) (e.g. structured or random packing) within the distillation column, simultaneously the liquid and the vapor flow in mutually opposite directions over the surface of the contact device along a main flow direction which is along a direction of the column axis;<br>
-	condensing water vapor with concentration of light isotopologue 1H216O 99.99% [C2] on condenser (5) installed on upper bound of the distillation column;<br>
-	and collecting a part of condensate as condensed highly pure light water comprising 99.99% of light isotopologue 1H2160 [C2 &gt; C1] appropriate for producing alcoholic beverages enriched with 1H2160.<br>
