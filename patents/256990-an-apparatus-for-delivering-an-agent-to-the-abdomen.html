TITLE	<br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DELIVERING AN AGENT<br>
TO THE ABDOMEN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to treating gases delivered into body cavities, spaces or<br>
body surfaces of an animal. More specifically, it relates to a device for, and method of,<br>
treating gases with one or more agents to be carried by the gas stream to an animal.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
The delivery of gas into the body of a patient is well known for many purposes.<br>
Gas is delivered into a body cavity, such as the abdomen, to distend a compliant surface<br>
or create pressure for a specific purpose. Distention of the abdomen using gas creates a<br>
pneumoperitoneum that achieves a space in which one can examine, repair, remove and<br>
surgically manipulate. The space created by gas insufflation is a basic component of<br>
laparoscopic surgery. Within the space of the body created by the gas flow and<br>
pressure, tissue surfaces and organs can be visualized safely and instruments placed<br>
that are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of such uses include,<br>
but are not limited to, coagulation, incision, grasping, clamping, suturing, stapling,<br>
moving, retracting and morcelizing. The quality of the gas stream can be modified and<br>
conditioned by filtering, heating and hydrating. U.S. Patent No. 5,411,474 and the<br>
aforementioned U.S. patent application disclose methods for conditioning gas in this<br>
matter.<br>
There is room for further improvement and advancement. During a procedure<br>
that instills gas to a body cavity, body space or body surface, the addition of<br>
pharmacologically active or inert materials (organic or inorganic) can enhance tissue<br>
healing, reduce infection, reduce adhesion formation, modify the immunologic<br>
response, treat neoplasm, treat specific disease processes, reduce pain and assist in<br>
diagnosis. It is desirable to provide an apparatus and method suitable for treating gas in<br>
such a manner.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Briefly, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for treating<br>
gas with one or more agents for delivery to a body cavity, body space or body surface.<br>
The gas is received into the apparatus from a gas source. The apparatus comprises a<br>
housing defining at least one chamber having an entry port and an exit port, the entry<br>
port for receiving a gas stream from a gas source. A quantity of one or more agents is<br>
released into the chamber to be admixed in the gas stream that is delivered to the<br>
animal by a delivery device. The gas stream is optionally humidified and/or heated in<br>
the housing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
As used in the claims, "a" can mean one or more.<br>
As used herein, "a predetermined temperature" or "a predetermined temperature<br>
range" is one that has been preset or programmed by the user during a procedure. For<br>
example, a desirable temperature range may be physiological body temperature, i.e.,<br>
approximately 35-40°C. As explained hereinafter, the temperature of the gas may be<br>
adjusted by a "dial" type or other similar adjustment.<br>
As used herein, the term "humidifying solution" means water, normal saline,<br>
lactated Ringers, any buffered liquid or solution, an aqueous solution, a non-water<br><br>
based solution, a combination of water or non-water solutions and other substances, or<br>
a gel substance containing water or non-water solutions and other substances.<br>
As used herein, the term "agent" means any organic substance, inorganic<br>
substance, inert or biologically active substance of pharmacologic material, that may<br>
effect or enhance tissue healing, reduce infection, reduce adhesions formation, modify<br>
the immunologic response, treat specific disease processes, reduce pain or be used for<br>
any therapeutic or diagnostic purpose. This includes materials in solid, liquid or gas<br>
phase, and materials that are water (aqueous) based, colloid and non-colloid<br>
suspensions, mixtures, solutions, hydrogels, lyophilized materials, hydrophobic,<br>
hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, surface active agents, surgical adjuvants, anticoagulants,<br>
antibiotics, immunologic stimulators, immunologic suppressants, growth inhibitors,<br>
growth stimulators, diagnostic materials, anesthetic agents, analgesic agents, and<br>
materials by themselves or dissolved or based in other materials, such as, but not<br>
limited to, alcohols, ethers, esters, lipids and solvents. The agent can be dry, such as in<br>
a power form. Any material that can be carried by the flow of gas into a body cavity or<br>
onto a surface for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes can be delivered in accordance<br>
with this invention. It is not intended to limit the present invention to the above<br>
examples of agents. Furthermore, the gas stream may be treated with any type or<br>
combination of agents in accordance with the present invention. An example is to treat<br>
the gas stream with a humidifying solution for hydration to prevent desiccation, an<br>
antibiotic to reduce infection, an anti-inflammatory to reduce inflammation and an anti-<br>
adhesive to reduce adhesions and improve healing. Agents such as those sold under the<br>
trademarks Adept manufactured by ML Laboratories, Adcon manufactured by Gliatech<br>
and Atrisol manufactured by Atrix Laboratories can be used to reduce adhesions.<br>
As used herein, the term "gas" includes any gas or combination or mixture of<br>
gases in any proportion that occurs naturally or can be manufactured or placed or<br>
created in a container.<br>
The term "treating" used in connection with treating of the gas stream means to<br>
inject or release one or more agents into the gas stream so that the gas stream is a fume<br>
or dust in the case of a solid phase agent, or a mist or spray in the case of a liquid phase<br>
agent. In some embodiments, such as where the agent is in liquid form, the agent is<br>
wicked off or dislodged from a container. In other cases, the agent is injected or<br><br>
released into the gas stream. la general, the gas stream to be treated with one or more<br>
agents is also humidified.<br>
The terms "cavity" or "space" means any body cavity or space including the<br>
interthoracic cavity, the pericardium, the peritoneal cavity or abdomen, plural cavity,<br>
knee space, shoulder space, eyeball, stomach and lung.<br>
The term "aerosol" means a suspension of liquid or solid particles in a gas.<br>
The term "spray" means a jet of liquid dispersed by a sprayer.<br>
The term "mist" means liquid in the form of particles suspended in a gas.<br>
The term "fog" means vapor condensed to fine particles of liquid suspended in a<br>
gas.<br>
The term "vapor" means a gas dispersion of molecules of a substance.<br>
The basic tenet of the present invention is to treat a flowing gas stream with one or<br>
more agents so that the agent(s) actively or passively are injected into the gas stream<br>
and are made part of the gas stream as a result of the dynamics of flow, vapor pressure<br>
and/or rate of evaporation. The gas stream thereby is modified to contain additives that<br>
are determined desirable by the user for purposes of enhancing the outcome of a gas<br>
delivery event in connection with, for example, a particular treatment or diagnostic<br>
procedure or prevention.<br>
The term "body surface" means any surface of the body, whether internal or<br>
external, and whether exposed naturally or by way of surgical procedure.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the apparatus for treating or conditioning gas is shown<br>
generally at reference numeral 100. The apparatus 100 is adapted to receive gas from a<br>
gas regulator 10 (high or low pressure, high or low flow rate), such as an insufflator.<br>
The apparatus comprises a gas treater 120, an optional filter 110 and an optional control<br>
module 140. Tubes are provided to connect the various components of the apparatus<br>
together. Specifically, a first tube segment 160 connects the outlet of the gas regulator<br>
10 to the inlet tubing of the filter 110 via a male Luer lock 166 or any appropriate<br>
adapter compatible with the insufflator outlet port. A second tube segment 162<br>
connects the outlet of the filter 110 to the inlet of the gas treater 120. A third tube<br>
segment 164 connects the outlet of the gas treater 120 by a male Luer lock 168 (or<br>
other appropriate fitting adapter) to a gas delivery device (not shown), such as a trocar,<br>
Veres needle, endoscope or a tube mat enters a body cavity or space that delivers the<br>
treated gas into the body of an animal. Alternatively, if the gas is to be delivered to a<br><br>
body surface, the gas delivery device may be shaped, formed or otherwise configured<br>
to direct or spread the flow of gas onto a surface.<br>
The tubing of the tube segments 160,162 and 164 is preferably flexible and<br>
sufficiently long to permit the gas regulator 10 and control module 140 to be placed at a<br>
convenient distance from an animal undergoing procedure requiring gas delivery. For<br>
applications of the apparatus 100 where the temperature of the gas stream should be<br>
within a desired range when delivered, the gas treater 120 is preferably placed<br>
immediately adjacent to that location where the gas is to be delivered.<br>
The filter 110 is an optional element and consists of a high efficiency,<br>
hydrophobic filter (for example Gelman Sciences Metricel M5PU025, having a pore<br>
size preferably small enough to exclude all solid particles and bacterial or fungal agents<br>
that may have been generated in a gas supply cylinder or the gas regulator 10 (i.e., 0.5<br>
micron or less and preferably about 0.3 micron). A preferable filter is a hydrophobic<br>
filter, such as a glass fiber-type filter, e.g., Metrigard by Gelman Sciences or Porous<br>
Media Ultraphobic filter, Model DDDF 4700 M02K-GB. Other suitable filters include<br>
polysulfone (Supor, HT Tuffrin, Gelman Sciences) and mixed cellulose esters (GN-6<br>
Metricel, Gelman Sciences), for example. Decreasing the pore size of filter 110 below<br>
0.1 micron causes a concomitant increase in pressure drop of gas, and thus flow rate is<br>
reduced significantly. If the procedure to be performed requires a relatively high<br>
pressure and/or flow rate of gas to the animal, such as laparoscopy, the pore size should<br>
preferably not decrease below 0.2 micron. A hydrophobic filter is preferable to a<br>
hydrophilic one, as a hydrophobic filter is less likely to tear under water pressure<br>
caused by accidentally suctioning or siphoning peritoneal or irrigation fluids.<br>
In some applications, it is desirable that the gas treater 120 be connected<br>
immediately adjacent to a gas delivery device so that the gas travels a minimum<br>
distance from the outlet of the gas treater 120 to the conduit or connection to the<br>
interior of an animal. The purpose of this arrangement is to allow gas to be delivered to<br>
the animal while still at a temperature and water content sufficiently close to the<br>
physiological interior body temperature or other body surface. That is, for some<br>
applications, the apparatus according to the invention prevents thermodynamic cooling<br>
of gases in transit to the animal, because it provides a highly efficient treatment<br>
chamber that, as a result of its efficiency, can be quite compact and thus be positioned<br>
very near to the animal.<br><br>
The control module 140 is contained within an electrical housing 210 and is<br>
connected to the gas treater 120 by several wire pairs contained within an insulated<br>
electrical cable 170. In particular, the cable 170 has a connector 172 at one end that<br>
electrically connects into a circuit connector 212 of the housing 210 for the control<br>
module 140, and at the other end it is electrically connected to the gas treater 120 by a<br>
sealed electrical feed through 174. The cable 170 is attached to the tube segment 162<br>
by a plastic tape or clip 176. Alternatively, the cable 170 is attached to the tube<br>
segment 162 by heat seal, extrusion, ultrasonic welding, glue or is passed through the<br>
interior of tube segment 162.<br>
The control module 140 and associated components in the gas treater 120 are<br>
preferably powered by an AC-DC converter 180. The AC-DC converter 180 has an<br>
output that is connected by a plug connector 182 into a power receptacle 214 of the<br>
circuit within the control module 140, and has a standard AC wall outlet plug 184 that<br>
can be plugged into standard AC power outlets. For example, the AC-DC converter<br>
180 is plugged into an AC power strip that is provided on other equipment in an<br>
operating room. Alternatively, electrical power for the apparatus is provided by a<br>
battery or photovoltaic source. Another alternative is to provide circuitry in the control<br>
module 140 that operates on AC signals, as opposed to DC signals, in which case the<br>
control module 140 could be powered directly by an AC outlet. The control module<br>
140 and the heating and hydrating components inside the gas treater 120 will be<br>
described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In some embodiments, the gas treater 120 has a charging port 190 that is<br>
capable of receiving a supply of an agent and/or humidifying solution. For example, a<br>
syringe 200 containing a predetermined volume of liquid-based agent is introduced into<br>
the charging port 190 to inject it into the gas treater 120 for an initial charge or re-<br>
charge thereof. The apparatus 100 may be sold with the gas treater 120 pre-charged<br>
with a supply of an agent and/or humidifying solution such that an initial charge is not<br>
required for operation.<br>
Turning to Figure 2, the gas treater 120 will be described in greater detail. The<br>
gas treater 120 comprises a housing 122 having an (entry port) gas inlet 124 and an<br>
(exit port) gas outlet 126. The housing 122 defines a chamber 128 that contains a<br>
treatment subchamber for treating the gas supplied through the inlet with an agent, and<br>
in some embodiments, contains elements for substantially simultaneously heating and<br><br>
hydrating (humidifying), as well as means 136 for sensing the temperature of the gas<br>
and means 138 for sensing the relative humidity of the gas as it exits the chamber 128.<br>
Specifically, in the embodiment of Figure 2, within the chamber 128, there is<br>
provided a subchamber that comprises of one or more layers of Uquid-retaining or<br>
absorbing padding or sponge material, shown at reference numerals 130,131 and 132.<br>
It should be understood that the number, spacing and absorbency of the Uquid-retaining<br>
layers 130,131 and 132 varies according to specific applications. Three layers are<br>
shown as an example. The material of the layers 130,131 and 132 can be any desirable<br>
liquid retaining or absorbent material, such as a rayon/polyester formed fabric (e.g., NU<br>
GAUZE™, manufactured and sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, Inc.). The pore<br>
size of the selected material should be chosen according to a balance of Uquid-retaining<br>
capabilities and low pressure drop considerations. The larger the pore size, the greater<br>
the liquid retention capability for gas contact for aerosolizing the gas.<br>
Other forms of the treatment subchamber may consist of an empty chamber, a<br>
subcontainer or subchamber of Uquid within the chamber 128 (without absorbent<br>
layers) having a semi-permeable membrane on opposite ends to allow gas to pass there<br>
through. The agent in the chamber is optionaUy heated by a heating jacket placed<br>
around the chamber.<br>
The heating means in the gas treater 120 consists of at least one heating element<br>
134 positioned in the housing, such as between the absorbent layers 130 and 131. The<br>
heating element 134 is an electrically resistive wire, for example. The heating element<br>
134 is placed preferably between absorbent layers or en-meshed within the layers of<br>
material (in the fabric). The heating element 134 heats the gas supplied through the<br>
inlet, under control of a heat control signal supplied by the control module 140,<br>
substantially simultaneous with the treatment of the gas as the gas passes through the<br>
chamber 128. Additional heating elements may be disposed within the chamber.<br>
In order to sense the temperature and humidity of the gas as it exits the gas<br>
treater 120, a temperature sensor 136 and a relative humidity sensor 138 are provided.<br>
The temperature sensor 136 may be provided anywhere within the flow of gas in the<br>
chamber 128, but is preferably positioned on the downstream side of the heating<br>
element 134 between liquid-retaining layers. The temperature sensor 136 is a<br>
thermistor (for example, Thermometries MA 100 Seres chip thermistor, or<br>
Thermometries Series BR23, Thermometries, Inc., Edison, New Jersey). It is<br><br>
preferable that the temperature sensor 136 be accurate to within about 0.2°C. In the<br>
present invention, the temperature of the gas is preferably sensed after the gas has been<br>
treated (and optionally humidified) so that any change in the temperature of the gas as<br>
it is treated is corrected at that point in the apparatus, thereby compensating for<br>
enthalpy changes.<br>
The humidity sensor 138 is positioned in the flow path of gas exiting the<br>
chamber 128, preferably downstream from the heating element 134 either between<br>
liquid-retaining layers or on the downstream side of the absorbent layers, proximate the<br>
exit port 126 of the housing 122. The humidity sensor 138 is preferably not in contact<br>
with a layer. Figure 2 shows the humidity sensor 138 distal to the absorbent layers,<br>
separated from the liquid-retaining layer 132 by a porous mesh (plastic or metal) layer<br>
133 that extends across the interior of the housing 122. The humidity sensor 138<br>
actually is generally not in contact with the porous mesh layer 133, but is spaced there<br>
from as well. The humidity sensor 138 is, in one embodiment, a humidity-sensitive<br>
capacitor sensor, such as a capacitive humidity sensor manufactured by Philips<br>
Corporation, which changes capacitance in response to humidity changes. The<br>
humidity sensor 138 measures the relative humidity of the gas as it passes through the<br>
chamber 128 to enable monitoring of the gas humidity, and in order to provide an<br>
indication of the amount of humidifying solution remaining in the gas treater 120, i.e.,<br>
in layers 130,131 and 132. As will be explained hereinafter, in one embodiment, a<br>
timer/divider integrated circuit (IC) 145 (Figure 5), is connected to the humidity sensor<br>
138 and is preferably disposed within the housing 122 together and substantially co-<br>
located with the humidity sensor 138. Other means of determining the humidity of the<br>
gas are well within the scope of the present invention.<br>
One way to treat a gas stream with one or more agents using the embodiment of<br>
the gas treater 120 shown in Figure 2 is to inject from a syringe 200 a liquid-based<br>
agent into the chamber 128 through the charging port 190 for absorption onto one of<br>
the layers 130-132. When the gas stream flows over the layers 130-132, the gas stream<br>
will become treated with agent and thereby carry the agent out of the gas treater 120<br>
into an animal. Depending on the dimensions and type of absorbent pad or pads used,<br>
there is a capacity to the amount of agent that can be introduced into the chamber 128.<br>
The size of the chamber 128 can be increased to allow for larger pads, and therefore<br>
greater capacity.<br><br>
Several additional embodiments of the invention will now be described in<br>
conjunction with Figures 3-9, and 12-15. In these embodiments, other configurations<br>
of the housing 122 of the gas treater 120 are described that are useful to treat the gas<br>
stream flowing through the gas treater housing 122 with one or more agents. These<br>
embodiments show different types of containers for containing an agent and releasing it<br>
into the gas stream in a chamber of the gas treater 120.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate an embodiment for the gas treater housing 122<br>
featuring multiple chambers, for example, three chambers 128A, 128B and 128C that<br>
extend a certain length portion (not necessarily all) of the housing 122. These<br>
chambers are separated by walls or partitions 202,204 and 206. Associated with each<br>
chamber 128A, 128B and 128C is a charging port 190A, 190B and 190C, respectively<br>
to receive a supply of agent from a respective source, such as an external bag, syringe,<br>
etc. The agent is delivered under pressure into a chamber through its respective<br>
charging port, or is wicked off from a small opening of a bag (Figs. 5 and 6) placed<br>
through the charging port into a chamber. Alternatively, within each chamber 128 A,<br>
128B and 128C is one or more absorbent pads or layers similar to that shown in Figure<br>
2, onto which a quantity of an agent is absorbed. Still a further alternative is to prpvide<br>
a separate semi-permeable membrane in each chamber filled with a different agent.<br>
Each of the chambers can be charged with a different agent. For example,<br>
chamber 128A may be charged with a humidifying solution, chamber 128B may be<br>
charged with agent A and chamber 128C may be charged with agent B. Though not<br>
shown in Figures 3 and 4, it should be understood that the heating elements,<br>
temperature sensor and humidity sensor shown in Figure 2 may optionally be included<br>
in their various configurations in the embodiment of the housing shown in Figures 3<br>
and 4. In the embodiment of Figures 3 and 4, when the gas stream flows through the<br>
housing 122, the gas stream wicks off or dislodges the humidifying solution from<br>
chamber 128A, is mixed with agent A from chamber 128B and is mixed with agent B<br>
from chamber 128C. Thus, the gas stream that exits the housing 120 is hydrated and<br>
treated with the agents, for delivery to an animal.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate another embodiment where the agents to be carried by<br>
the gas stream are contained within bags. In Figure 5, there are, for example, two bags<br>
220 and 230 each of which are to contain a quantity of an agent. The apparatus may be<br>
shipped with the bags 220 and 230 pre-loaded or pre-charged with a quantity of agents,<br><br>
or they may be filled with a quantity of agents prior to use. The bags 220 and 230 are<br>
formed of flexible material such as, polyethylene or other similar material. In one<br>
configuration, the bags 220 and 230 are formed of semi-permeable membrane material<br>
such that the agent contained therein can be wicked off by the flowing gas stream over<br>
the surface of the bags through the housing 122. In another configuration, at the end of<br>
each bag 220 and 230 inside the housing 122 is a restrictive orifice, nozzle or hole 222<br>
and 232, respectively, such as a spray hole or atomizer hole to allow for contact with<br>
the gas stream to be admixed therewith. At the other end of each bag 220 and 230 is an<br>
optional charging port 224 and 234, respectively, to allow the introduction of a quantity<br>
of an agent into the bags 220 and 230. Openings are made in the housing 122 to allow<br>
a length of the bags 220 and 230 to pass there through and into the chamber.<br>
As the bags are filled, they expand inside the chamber 128. The pressure of the<br>
quantity of agent in the bags 220 and 230 and/or capillary action at the holes 222 and<br>
232 forces the agent to drip out of the holes 222 and 232 to be wicked off or dislodged<br>
by the flowing gas stream through the chamber 128 and carried out of the exit port of<br>
the housing 122. In the configuration where the bags 220 and 230 are formed of a<br>
semi-permeable membrane material, the pressure of the quantity of agent in the bags<br>
facilitates the wicking off of the agent through the membrane. The bags 220 and 230<br>
are deployed within the chamber 128 so that when they are filled, they expand and are<br>
substantially confined to a predetermined region of the chamber so as not to interfere<br>
with gas flow over the other bag. For example, a heating coil 124 or an absorbent pad<br>
can be used to separate the bags 220 and 230 in the chamber 128.<br>
Figure 5 shows only two bags 220 and 230, but it should be understood that one<br>
or any number of bags may be suitable depending on the number of agents to be carried<br>
by the gas stream.<br>
Figure 6 shows a variation of the embodiment of Figure 5 wherein the bags 220<br>
and 230 are located on the outside or exterior of the housing 122. In this configuration,<br>
openings are made in the housing 122 and the holes 222 and 232 of the bags are located<br>
just inside the housing 122 at these openings. The agents bead out of the holes 222 and<br>
232 and are wicked off or dislodged by the flowing gas stream through the chamber<br>
128. In addition, there will be a natural tendency for the agent in the bags 220 and 230<br>
to enter the flowing gas stream from the holes 222 and 232 due to the change in vapor<br>
pressure. Because the gas stream is relatively dry and by contrast, the agent in the bags<br><br>
220 and 230 may have some degree of moisture, a natural mechanism occurs by which<br>
the moist agent will wick out of the bags in an attempt to reach a vapor pressure<br>
equilibrium. The greater the rate of flow of the gas stream, the less of the agent in the<br>
bags 220 and 230 that will bead into the gas stream. The same theory of operation<br>
applies to the embodiment of Figure 5.<br>
Even if deployed on the outside of the housing 122, the bags 220 and 230 can<br>
be filled through their respective charging ports 224 and 234 in the same manner as<br>
described in conjunction with Figure 5. The number of bags may vary on a particular<br>
application, and two are shown in Figures 5 and 6 only as an example. All other<br>
features concerning the heating, humidification and sensing in the housing 122 are<br>
applicable to the embodiments shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
A still further variation on the embodiments of Figures 5 and 6 is to provide the<br>
optional tubing member 250 that extends from a bag to an optional absorbent pad 130<br>
that is positioned within the housing 122.<br>
Further embodiments for deploying one or more agents into the gas stream are shown<br>
in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows an elongated tubing member 300 that is disposed in<br>
the chamber 128 of the housing 122. The tubing member 300 is extremely long and<br>
winds throughout the chamber 128; Figure 7 is over-simplified in this respect. The<br>
tubing member 300 is, for example, a polyamide tubing product manufactured by<br>
MicroLumen of Tampa, Florida. The important characteristics of the tubing material<br>
are that the sides or walls of the tubing member 300 are as thin as possible so that the<br>
volume of agent that the tubing member 300 can carry is maximized. At the tip or end<br>
of the tubing member 300 is a restrictive orifice or hole 310 through which the agent<br>
may bead and be wicked off or dislodged into the gas stream, then multiple tubing<br>
members each containing a different agent is provided. A charging port 312 is also<br>
provided on the proximal end of the tubing member 300 just outside the housing 122 to<br>
supply a quantity of the agent into the tubing member 300.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a variation of the embodiment shown in Figure 7, wherein a<br>
tubing member 400 is provided that includes one or a plurality of holes or perforations<br>
410 along the length of the tubing member 400 through which the agent is allowed to<br>
release into the chamber 128. The gas stream flowing through the chamber 128 will<br>
wick off or dislodge the agent from the holes 410 and carry the agent in the gas stream.<br>
The tubing member 400 has a charging port 412 similar to charging port 300 for tubing<br><br>
member 300. Also, multiple tubing members 400 may be provided in the chamber to<br>
release multiple types of agents into the gas stream. The length of each tubing member<br>
400 and the quantity and size of the holes 412 therein may be selected to control the<br>
rate at which different agents from different tubing members 400 are wicked off or<br>
dislodged by the gas stream flowing through the chamber 128.<br>
In the embodiments shown in Figures 2-8, the size of the chamber 128 of the<br>
gas treater housing 122 may vary depending on the intended use, gas flow, type of<br>
agent, whether and how many absorbent pads are provided, etc. There is no limit,<br>
either relative small, or relatively large, to the size of the chamber for purposes of<br>
carrying out the present invention.<br>
Turning to Figure 9, yet another embodiment is shown wherein an inkjet<br>
printhead cartridge 500 is used to release vapor bubbles containing a quantity of one or<br>
more agents into the chamber 128 of the housing 122. The inkjet printhead cartridge<br>
500 may be one of any known inkjet printheads such as those used in inkjet printers<br>
sold by Hewlett-Packard, Canon, etc.<br>
As is well known in the art, an inkjet printhead cartridge, such as that shown at<br>
reference numeral 500, comprises a reservoir 510, a printhead 520 and a plurality of<br>
contact pads 530. Conductive traces in the cartridge 500 are terminated by the contact<br>
pads 530. The contact pads are designed to normally interconnect with a printer so that<br>
the contact pads 530 contact printer electrodes that provide externally generated<br>
energization signals to the printhead 520 to spray ink onto paper. Thermal inkjet<br>
printheads create vapor bubbles by elevating the ink temperature, at the surface of a<br>
plurality of heaters, to a superheat limit. This same process can be used to create vapor<br>
bubbles of one or more agents. The printhead 520 comprises a plurality of nozzles 522<br>
from which the vapor bubbles are released when heaters are energized to heat the<br>
quantity of agent contained in the reservoir.<br>
According to the present invention, the inkjet printhead cartridge 500 is<br>
connected to a control circuit 600 by way of connector 610 having contacts to match<br>
the contact pads 530. The control circuit 600 may be contained within the control<br>
module 140 shown in Figure 1 and coupled to the cartridge 500 by one or more<br>
electrical conductors contained in the electrical cable 170. The reservoir 510 is filled<br>
with a quantity or volume of one or more agents to be released into the chamber 128.<br>
For example, a color inkjet printhead cartridge contains multiple chambers or reservoirs<br><br>
for each of three colors of ink. Using this same type of device, an inkjet printhead<br>
cartridge may contain a quantity or volume of several different agents to be separately<br>
or simultaneously delivered into the chamber in controlled amounts. The control<br>
circuit 600 generates appropriate control signals that are coupled to the cartridge 500<br>
via the connector 610 to drive the heaters in the printhead 520 and release vapor<br>
bubbles of one or more agents into the chamber from the nozzles 522.<br>
When the one or more agents are released into the chamber 128, the gas stream<br>
that flows through the chamber and carries the agent out the exit port of the housing<br>
122 and into the animal. Each of the different agents can be released into the chamber<br>
128 at different rates or volumes. Furthermore, it is possible that a different inkjet<br>
printhead cartridge is provided for each of separate subchambers inside chamber 128 to<br>
keep the agents from mixing for a period of time before delivered into the animal.<br>
Referring back to Figure 2, electrical connections to the components inside the<br>
housing 122 of the gas treater 120 are as follows. A ground or reference lead (not<br>
specifically shown) is provided that is connected to each of the temperature sensor 136,<br>
heating element 134 and humidity sensor 138-timer/divider 145. A wire 175 (for a<br>
positive lead) electrically connects to the hearing element 134 and a wire 176 (for a<br>
positive lead) electrically connects to the temperature sensor 136. In addition, three<br>
wires 177 A, 177B and 177C electrically connect to the humidity sensor 138-<br>
timer/divider circuitry, wherein wire 177A carries a DC voltage to the timer/divider<br>
145, wire 177B carries an enable signal to the timer/divider 145, and wire 177C carries<br>
an output signal (data) from the timer/divider 145. All of the wires are fed from the<br>
insulated cable 170 into the feedthrough 174 and through small holes in the housing<br>
122 into the chamber 128. The feedthrough 174 is sealed at the opening 178 around the<br>
cable 170.<br>
The charging port 190 is attached to a lateral extension 139 of the housing 122.<br>
The charging port 190 comprises a cylindrical body 192 containing a resealable<br>
member 194. The resealable member 194 permits a syringe or similar device to be<br>
inserted there through, but seals around the exterior of the syringe tip. This allows a<br>
volume of liquid agent or humidifying solution to be delivered into the chamber 128<br>
without releasing the liquid already contained therein. The resealable member 194 is,<br>
for example, Baxter InterLink™ injection site 2N3379. Alternatively, the charging port<br>
may be embodied by a one-way valve, a sealable port, a screw cap, a cap with a slit to<br><br>
permit the introduction of a syringe or other device, such as a SafelineTM injection site,<br>
part number NF9100, manufactured by B. Braun Medical Inc., or any other covering<br>
material or member capable of permitting the introduction of a syringe and preventing<br>
the backflow of contained liquid or gas. The control module 140 will issue a warning<br>
when the humidity of the gas being treated by the gas treater 120 drops below a<br>
predetermined or user programmable relative humidity, as explained hereinafter.<br>
As an alternative, or in addition to the sensing and monitoring features<br>
. described above, a backup or reserve supply container for liquid agent and/or<br>
humidifying solution is provided. Referring back to Figure 1, one form of a backup<br>
supply container is a container 800 that hangs free of the apparatus 100 and is<br>
connected with an access tubing 810 to the charging port 190. The container 800 is, for<br>
example, a bag such as an intravenous fluid bag and the access tubing 810 is an<br>
intravenous type tubing.<br>
Another form of a backup supply container is a container 850 that attaches to a<br>
portion of the apparatus 100. For example, the container 850 is a reservoir tube, bag,<br>
syringe or tank that is attached to the tubing segment 162 or is strapped or fastened to<br>
the tubing segment 162 close to the gas treater 120. Another alternative would be to<br>
strap or fasten it to the outside of the housing 122 of the gas heater 120. The container<br>
850 is connected to an access tubing 860 that connects into the charging port 190,<br>
similar to access tubing 810 described above.<br>
Access tubing 810 and 860 have a penetrating member (not shown) at their<br>
distal ends to penetrate the charging port 190 to gain access to the chamber 128 of the<br>
gas treater housing 122. Alternatively, instead of the access tubing 860, the container<br>
850 has at the end proximate the charging port 190 a tip member similar to that of the<br>
syringe 200 to penetrate and directly couple to the charging port 190.<br>
The containers 800 and 850 can be pre-charged or charged prior to use<br>
according to techniques well known in the art. For example, container 850 has an<br>
injection site 862 to enable injection of liquid into the container 850.<br>
Preferably, the access tubing 810 or 860 of the backup supply containers 800<br>
and 850, respectively, (or the integral penetrating tip of the container 850) extend far<br>
enough through the charging port 190 so as to make contact with one of the layers 130-<br>
132 so that the liquid therein is wicked off on to one of the layers 130-132 due to<br>
capillary forces. Alternatively, the access tubing 810 or 860 (or integral penetrating tip<br><br>
of the container 850) stops short of one of the layers 130-132, and the pressure<br>
differential created by the flowing gas stream through the housing 122 will wick off the<br>
liquid agent and/or humidifying solution from the end of these members to contribute<br>
to the treatment of the gas.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, another variation is to provide an extension tube 870<br>
that leads from the charging port 190 where the access tubing 810 or 860 (or the<br>
integral penetrating tip member of the container 850) terminates, to the treatment<br>
subchamber inside the chamber 128, i.e., to contact one or more of the layers 130-132.<br>
Liquid agent and/or humidifying solution is continuously wicked out from the end of<br>
the extension tube 870 onto one of the layers 130-132.<br>
In either form of the backup supply container, the basic principle is the same.<br>
The backup supply container provides is coupled through the charging port 190 to the<br>
treatment subchamber inside the chamber 128 to constantly replenish the treatment<br>
subchamber, e.g., one or more of the layers 130,131 or 132. Consequently, the<br>
treatment subchamber will have an initial amount of liquid agent and/or humidifying<br>
solution (pre-charged or charged prior to use) and a backup supply from the backup<br>
supply container is constantly supplied to the treatment subchamber to constantly<br>
replenish it as gas flows through the chamber. The overall time of sufficient gas<br>
humidification and/or treatment is thereby lengthened to a duration that is suitable for<br>
all or nearly all gas delivery applications. As a result, there is no need to be concerned<br>
about decreasing humidity of the gas delivered. The backup supply container acts as a<br>
backup to provide gas humidification and/or treatment for an entire procedure.<br>
Therefore, some forms of the apparatus 100 need not include the humidity and<br>
temperature sensing and monitoring features, or the recharge alert, described herein.<br>
The features provide another type of backup that may be useful in certain applications,<br>
instead of, or in addition to the backup supply container.<br>
The desirable width and diameter of the gas treater is dependent upon many<br>
factors, including the intended use, the rate of gas flow from the gas source and the<br>
pressure desired to be maintained, which is affected more by the diameter of chamber<br>
128 than by its length. A person of ordinary skill in the art, given the teachings and<br>
examples herein, can readily determine suitable dimensions for chamber 128 without<br>
undue experimentation. It should also be noted, however, that upon activating the<br>
apparatus or changing the demand on the apparatus (e.g., flow rate or pressure), there is<br><br>
a lag time of only several tenths seconds for sensing the temperature of gas and<br>
adjusting the hearing element to achieve the proper gas or desired temperature. Such a<br>
fast start-up time is extremely beneficial.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the heating element 134 is shown in more detail. The<br>
heating element 134 is an electrically resistive wire that is disposed in the housing 128<br>
in a concentrical coil configuration having a number of turns, such as 6-8 turns.<br>
Alternatively, a second heating element 134' is provided that is arranged with respect to<br>
the heating element 134 such that its coils are offset from those pf the first heating<br>
element, relative to the direction of gas flow through the chamber. If two or more<br>
heating elements are employed, they are preferably spaced from each other in the<br>
chamber of the gas treater by approximately 3-4 mm. The first and second heating<br>
elements 134 and 134' can be coiled in opposite directions relative to each other. This<br>
arrangement allows for maximum contact of the gas flowing through the chamber with<br>
a heating element Other non-coiled configurations of the heating element 134 are also<br>
suitable.<br>
Turning to Figure 11, another feature of the gas treater 120 is illustrated. At the<br>
inlet and/or outlet of the housing 122, fluted surfaces 123 may be provideji to facilitate<br>
complete dispersion of gas as it is supplied to the gas treater 120. This improves the<br>
fluid dynamics of the gas flow through the chamber 128 to ensure that the gas is<br>
uniformly heated and humidified as it flows through the chamber 128.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 illustrate embodiments of the apparatus to treat the gas<br>
stream with a solid phase agent. Figure 12 shows a container 700 of a solid phase<br>
agent, such as in power form, that is positioned in the chamber 128 of the gas treater<br>
housing 122. The container 700 includes a check valve 710 and a pressurizer 720, such<br>
as a carbon dioxide cartridge. When the pressurizer 720 is activated, pressure inside<br>
the container 700 is caused to rise, such that the bias of the check valve 710 is<br>
overcome, releasing the agent into the chamber 128. A button 730 on the exterior of<br>
the housing 122 is coupled by a wire or other means to pressurizer 720 to activate it<br>
remotely.<br>
Figure 13 shows a container 700 of solid phase agent positioned outside of the<br>
housing 122. The check valve 710 of the container 700 is fed through an opening in the<br>
housing 122 into the chamber 128. The button 730 for activating the pressurizer is.<br><br>
optionally positioned on the exterior of the container 700. Operation of the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 13 is similar to that of Figure 12.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 12 and 13, the rate at which the solid phase agent<br>
is released into the chamber 128 is dependent upon the pressure created in the container<br>
700 by the pressurizer 720 and the size of the check valve 710. It may be desirable to<br>
deliver short bursts of the solid phase agent into the gas stream, or to deliver it into the<br>
gas stream on a continuous basis. If necessary, a separate backup source of pressure<br>
may be coupled to the container 700 to provide for longer term treatment of the gas<br>
stream. In any case, the gas stream flowing through the housing 122 will carry the<br>
solid phase agent with through the exit port.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, the control module 140 will be described in detail. The<br>
control module 140 contains monitoring circuitry and control circuitry for the apparatus<br>
100. It is understood that some forms of the apparatus 100 need not include the<br>
humidity (and heating) sensing, monitoring, temperature control and recharge alert<br>
functions. The control module 140 comprises a voltage regulator 141, a<br>
microcontroller 142, an A/D converter 143, a dual operational amplifier (hereinafter<br>
"op-amp") module 144, and a timer/divider 145. The monitoring circuit portion of the<br>
control module 140 consists of the combination of the microcontroller 142 and<br>
timer/divider 145. The control circuit portion of the control module 140 consists of the<br>
microcontroller 142, A/D converter 143 and op-amp module 144. The monitoring<br>
circuit monitors the relative humidity of gas exiting the chamber based on a signal<br>
generated by the timer/divider 145. The control circuit monitors the temperature of the<br>
gas exiting the chamber and in response, controls electrical power to the heating<br>
element to regulate the temperature of the gas to a user programmable or fixed<br>
temperature or temperature range. While the temperature of the gas exiting the<br>
chamber is actively controlled, the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber is not<br>
actively controlled; rather it is monitored and an alert is generated when it drops below<br>
a corresponding threshold so that appropriate action can be taken, such as replenishing<br>
the gas treater 120 with liquid agent or humidifying solution.<br>
Figure 14 shows that several components are preferably located within the<br>
electrical housing 210 (Figure 1), whereas other components are located within the<br>
housing of the gas treater 120 (Figure 2). In particular, the timer/divider 145 and the<br>
associated resistors R4 and R5 are preferably located inside the housing 122 of the gas<br><br>
trealer 120, together with the humidity sensor 138 in a circuit package that includes the<br>
humidity sensor 138 exposed on one or more surfaces thereof. More specifically, the<br>
timer/divider 145 is co-located with humidity sensor 138. This configuration<br>
minimizes timing error by stray wiring inductance and capacitance (sensor kept close to<br>
active circuits of timer/divider 145). In addition, by co-locating the timer/divider 145<br>
and humidity sensor 138, the need for interconnecting wires is eliminated, thereby<br>
avoiding undesirable signal radiation.<br>
The voltage regulator 141 receives as input the DC output of the AC-DC<br>
converter 180 (Figure 1), such as for example, 9V DC, that is suitable for use by the<br>
analog components of the control module. The voltage regulator 141 regulates this<br>
voltage to generate a lower voltage, such as 5 V DC, for use by the digital components<br>
of the control module. The capacitor C1 at the output of the voltage regulator 141<br>
serves to filter out any AC components, as is well known in the art. Alternatively, a<br>
suitable DC voltage is provided by a battery or photovoltaic source shown at reference<br>
numeral 149.<br>
The microcontroller 142 is a PIC16C84 integrated circuit microcontroller that<br>
controls system operation. A ceramic resonator 146 (4 MHz) is provided to supply a<br>
raw clock signal to pins 15 and 16 of the microcontroller 142, which uses it to generate<br>
a clock signal for the signal processing functions explained hereinafter.<br>
The op-amp 144 module is coupled (by wire 176) to the temperature sensor 136<br>
(thermistor) mounted in the housing of the gas treater. The op-amp module 144 is, for<br>
example, a LTC1013 dual low-input-offset-voltage operational amplifier integrated<br>
circuit that includes two op-amps, referred to hereinafter as op-amp A and op-amp B.<br>
The non-inverting input of the op-amp A of the op-amp module 144 is pin 3, and pin 2<br>
is the inverting input. The output of op-amp A is pin 1. Op-amp A of the op-amp<br>
module 144 is used to buffer the output voltage of the voltage divider formed by<br>
resistors R1 and R2. The buffered output voltage, referred to as Vx in Figure 5, is<br>
applied to op-amp B in the op-amp module 144. Op-amp B is configured as a non-<br>
inverting- with-offset amplifier with a gain of 21.5, and also receives as input the output<br>
of the temperature sensor 136, adjusted by resistor R3, shown as voltage Vy in the<br>
diagram. The output voltage of op-amp B is at pin 7, referred to as Vo in Figure 5.<br>
The output voltage Vo is equal to 21.5Vy - 20.5 Vx, which is inversely proportional to<br><br>
the gas temperature in the housing of the gas treater. The output voltage Vo ranges<br>
between 0-5 V DC, depending on the temperature of the gas in the chamber.<br>
The A/D converter 143 is an ADC 0831 integrated circuit analog-to-digital<br>
converter that receives as input at pin 2, the output Vo of the op-amp module 144. The<br>
A/D converter 143 generates a multi-bit digital word, consisting of 8 bits for example,<br>
that represents the output voltage Vo, and is supplied as output at pin 6, which in turn is<br>
coupled to I/O pin 8 of the microcontroller 142. The microcontroller 142 commands<br>
the A/D converter 143 to output the digital word by issuing a control signal on I/O pin<br>
10 which is coupled to the chip select pin 1 of the A/D converter 143. Moreover, the<br>
microcontroller 142 controls the rate at which the A/D converter 143 outputs the digital<br>
word by supplying a sequence of pulses on pin 9 applied to clock input pin 7 of the A/D<br>
converter 143. The "unbalanced bridge" values of resistors Rl, R2 and R3 are chosen<br>
to produce a 0-5V DC output over gas temperatures from approximately 20°C to<br>
approximately 45°C. Since the bridge and the reference for the A/D converter 143 are<br>
provided by the same 5V DC source, error due to any reference voltage shift is<br>
eliminated.<br>
The timer/divider 145 is, for example, a MC14541 precision timer/divider<br>
integrated circuit. The humidity sensor 138 is connected to pin 2 and to resistors R4<br>
and R5 as shown. In response to an enable signal output by the microcontroller 142 on<br>
pin 12 that is coupled to timer/divider pin 6, the timer/divider 145 generates an output<br>
signal that oscillates at a rate determined by the value of the resistor R4, the capacitance<br>
of the humidity sensor 138 (which varies according to the relative humidity of the gas<br>
inside the gas treater housing) and a predetermined divider constant. For example, the<br>
divider constant is 256. Specifically, the output signal of the timer/divider 145 is a<br>
square wave oscillating between 0V ("low") and 5V ("high") at a frequency of<br>
approximately l/[256*2.3*R4t*Q]Hz, where R4t is, for example, 56 kOhms, and C1 is<br>
the capacitance at some time (t) of the relative humidity sensor 138 depending on the<br>
relative humidity of the gas in the chamber. For example, the humidity sensor<br>
manufactured by Phillips Electronics, referred to above, can measure between 10-<br>
90%RH (relative humidity), where Ct at 43%RH is 122 pF (+/- 15%), with a sensitivity<br>
of 0.4 +/- 0.5 pF per 1%RH. The output signal of the timer/divider 145 appears at pin<br>
8, which is coupled to the I/O pin 13 of the microcontroller 142. Thus, the<br>
timer/divider 145 is essentially an oscillator circuit connected to the humidity sensor<br><br>
that generates an output signal with a frequency dependent on a capacitance of the<br>
humidity sensor. Any oscillator circuit that can generate as output a signal whose<br>
frequency is dependent on a variable capacitance may be suitable for the timer/divider<br>
145.<br>
The microcontroller 142 computes a measure of the relative humidity of the gas<br>
inside the gas treater housing by timing or measuring a characteristic of the output<br>
signal of the timer/divider 145. Specifically, microcontroller measures the time<br>
duration of one of the phases of the output signal of the timer/divider 142, such as the<br>
"high" phase which is approximately ½* [256*2.3*R4t*Ct]. This time duration is<br>
indicative of the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber of the gas treater since the<br>
rate of the oscillation of the timer/divider depends on the capacitance of the humidity<br>
sensor 138, as explained above. For example, for a change in RH of 10-50% and/or 50<br>
to 90%, there is a 13% change in the duration of the "high" phase of the timer/divider<br>
output signal. The microcontroller 142 monitors the relative humidity of the gas<br>
exiting the chamber in this manner and when it drops below a predetermined relative<br>
humidity threshold (indicated by a corresponding predetermined change in the<br>
oscillation rate of the timer/divider 145), the microcontroller 142 generates a signal on<br>
pin 17, called a recharge signal, that drives transistor Q3 to activate an audible alarm<br>
device, such as buzzer 147. The buzzer 147 generates an audible sound which indicates<br>
that the relative humidity of the gas in the gas treater has dropped below the<br>
predetermined threshold and that it is necessary to recharge the gas treater with liquid.<br>
The predetermined relative humidity threshold corresponds to a rninimum level for a<br>
desirable relative humidity range of the gas exiting the gas treater, and may be 40%, for<br>
example. The predetermined relative humidity threshold is an adjustable or<br>
programmable parameter in the microcontroller 142. Optionally, the microcontroller<br>
142 may generate another warning signal at the output of pin 7 to illuminate a light<br>
emitting diode (LED) 148 A, thereby providing a visual indication of the humidity<br>
dropping below the predetermined relative humidity threshold in the gas treater, and the<br>
need to recharge the gas treater 120 with liquid. Further, the microcontroller 142<br>
generates a trouble or warning signal output at pin 6 to drive LED 148B (of a different<br>
color than LED 148A, for example) when there is either a "code fault" in the<br>
microcontroller 142 (an extremely unlikely occurrence) or when the relative humidity<br>
of the gas in the gas treater is less than a critical relative humidity threshold (lower than<br><br>
the predetermined relative humidity threshold), such as 10%. In either case, power to<br>
the heating element 134 is terminated in response to the warning signal.<br>
The microcontroller 142 also controls the heating element 134 in order to<br>
regulate the temperature of the gas inside the gas treater. Accordingly, the<br>
microcontroller 142 processes the digital word supplied by the A/D converter 143 to<br>
determine the temperature of the gas inside the gas treater housing. In response, the<br>
microcontroller 142 generates a heat control signal on the output pin 11 that drives<br>
transistor Ql, which in turn drives the MOSFET power transistor Q2, that supplies<br>
current to the heating element 134. The temperature of the gas inside the gas treater is<br>
regulated by the microcontroller 142 so that it is within a predetermined temperature<br>
range as it exits the gas treater for delivery into the body of a patient. The<br>
predetermined temperature range that the gas is regulated to is approximately 35°-<br>
40°C, but preferably is 37°C. As mentioned above, when the relative humidity inside<br>
the gas treater falls below a critical threshold as determined by the monitoring circuit<br>
portion of the control module 140, the control circuit portion in response terminates<br>
power to the heating element 134 to prevent the delivery of warm gas that is extremely<br>
dry.<br>
The circuitry for monitoring the relative humidity of the gas can be embodied<br>
by other circuitry well known in the art. In addition, while the control module 140 has<br>
been described as having a single microcontroller 142 for monitoring signals<br>
representing temperature and relative humidity of the gas exiting the chamber, and for<br>
controlling the heating element to control the temperature of the gas, it should be<br>
understood that two or more microcontrollers could be used dedicated to the individual<br>
functions. In addition, the functions of the microcontroller 142 could be achieved by<br>
other circuits, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), digital logic<br>
circuits, a microprocessor, or a digital signal processor.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates an alternative embodiment for monitoring relative humidity<br>
of the gas, in which a humidity sensitive resistor is used, instead of a humidity sensitive<br>
capacitor 138. The humidity sensing scheme employing a resistive humidity sensor<br>
does not require the timer/divider circuit 145 shown in Figure 14. The humidity<br>
sensitive resistor 900 is located inside the gas treater housing in a suitable location for<br>
sensing the relative humidity of the gas stream flowing through the gas treater 120. A<br>
suitable humidity sensitive resistor is a model UPS600 resistor by Ohmic, which at<br><br>
45% RH is approximately 30.7 k Ohms. A resistor R10 is coupled in a voltage divider<br>
configuration with the humidity sensitive resistor 900. Three pins of the<br>
microcontroller 142 couple to the voltage divider formed by resistor R10 and humidity<br>
sensitive resistor 900.<br>
Pin 910 of the microcontroller 142 is coupled to one terminal of the resistor<br>
R10, pin 912 is coupled to one terminal of the humidity sensitive resistor 900 and pin<br>
914 is coupled to the terminal between the resistor R10 and the humidity sensitive<br>
resistor 900. The humidity sensitive resistor 900 may be a type that requires AC<br>
excitation. Accordingly, the microcontroller 142 excites the humidity sensitive resistor<br>
900 by applying an alternating pulse, such as a 5-volt pulse, to pins 910 and 912, such<br>
that pin 912 is "high" for a period of time and pin 910 is low. As a result, the average<br>
excitation voltage to the humidity sensitive resistor 900 is zero. During the time period<br>
when pin 910 is "high", the microcontroller 142 senses the humidity of the gas by<br>
determining if the tap voltage pin 914 is a logic "zero" or a logic "one". If it is a logic<br>
zero (low voltage), the resistance of the humidity sensitive resistor 900 is low,<br>
indicating that the relative humidity of the gas is still high. If it is a logic one (high<br>
voltage), then the resistance of the humidity sensitive resistor 900 is high, indicating<br>
that the relative humidity of the gas is low. The value of the resistor R10 is chosen to<br>
yield a transition at pin 914 at a desired humidity threshold, such as 45% RH, with a 2.5<br>
V transition from a low voltage to a high voltage. For example, resistor R10 is a 30k<br>
ohm resistor. In the embodiment employing a resistive humidity sensor, a<br>
microcontroller that is suitable is a PIC 16C558 in place of the microcontroller model<br>
referred to above in conjunction with Figure 14. This sensing scheme can be simplified<br>
even further if a relative humidity sensor that allows DC excitation is used. In this<br>
case, only one pin of the microcontroller 142 need be associated with humidity sensing.<br>
A resistive humidity sensor has certain advantages over a capacitive humidity<br>
sensor. It has been found that the specific type of resistive humidity sensor referred to<br>
above can tolerate immersion in water in the gas treater 120 if a user accidentally over-<br>
fills the gas treater 120. In addition, the sensing scheme using a resistive sensor does<br>
not require a relatively high frequency square wave signal, which may be undesirable in<br>
some environments where the apparatus is used. Finally, the resistive sensor affords<br>
better accuracy for relative humidity sensing in some applications.	x<br><br>
Other variations or enhancements to the circuitry shown in Figure 14 are<br>
possible. The type of microcontroller used can be one, such as the PIC16C715, that<br>
incorporates the functions of the A/D converter 143. The PIC16C715 microcontroller<br>
incorporates a multichannel A/D converter. In addition, a more feature rich<br>
microcontroller of this type will allow for the addition of a display, such as a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD) or LED display. The microcontroller could generate information<br>
on a periodic basis to be displayed to the user, such as gas temperature and relative<br>
.humidity. In addition, the microcontroller may directly drive an audible alert device,<br>
rather than indirectly driving it through a transistor as shown in Figure 14. These are<br>
examples of the types of modifications or variations that are possible depending on the<br>
type of microcontroller that is selected for use in the control module 140.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the setup and operation of the apparatus 100<br>
will be described. The AC/DC converter 180 is plugged into a 110V AC power source,<br>
such as a wall outlet or a power strip. The control module 140 is connected to the<br>
AC/DC converter 180. Alternatively, the apparatus 100 may be powered by a battery<br>
or photovoltaic source. The heater/hydrating tubing set is then installed by attaching<br>
one end of the tube segment 160 to the outlet of the insufflator 10 by the Luer lock 166.<br>
The tube segments 160,162 and 164 may be pre-attached to the filter 110 and the gas<br>
treater 120 for commercial distribution of the apparatus 100. The cable 170 is installed<br>
into the electrical housing 210 of control module 140 by the connector 172.<br>
The gas treater 120 is charged with a supply of liquid agent and/or humidifying<br>
solution by the syringe 200. The syringe 200 is then inserted into the charging port 190<br>
so that a needle or cannula of the syringe 200 penetrates the resealable member 194<br>
(Figure 2) and the liquid is injected into the gas treater 120 to be absorbed by the<br>
absorbent layers. The syringe 200 is then removed from the charging port 190, and the<br>
charging port 190 seals itself. The free end of the tube segment 164 is attached to a gas<br>
delivery device by the Luer lock 168 or other appropriate connector. Alternatively, the<br>
gas treater 120 may be pre-charged with liquid, thus not requiring a charge prior to<br>
operation.<br>
If the embodiment of Figure 5 or 6 is employed, then the bags 220 and 230 are<br>
charged (unless they are pre-charged) with a quantity of one or more agents. Likewise,<br>
if the embodiment of Figure 7 or 8 is employed, the tube member 300 or tube member<br>
400 is charged (unless it is pre-charged) with a quantity of one or more agents. The<br><br>
nozzles 522 of the printhead 520 are positioned in alignment with an opening to the<br>
housing 122. Finally, if the embodiment of Figures 12 or 13 is employed, the container<br>
700 is prepared for use as described above in conjunction with Figures 12 and 13.<br>
Once the gas regulator 10 is activated, it receives gas from a gas supply cylinder<br>
and regulates the pressure and flow rate of the gas, both of which can be adjusted by the<br>
operator. The pressure and volumetric flow rate are controlled by adjusting controls<br>
(not shown) on the gas regulator 10. Gas then flows through the tube segment 160 into<br>
the optional filter 110 where it is filtered, and then through tube segment 162 into the<br>
gas treater 120. In the gas treater 120, gas comes into contact with the optional<br>
electrical heating element 134 and the optional humidifying liquid-retaining layer(s)<br>
130-132 which are positioned within the flow path of the gas, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Depending on which gas treater embodiment of Figures 2-9,12, or 13 is<br>
employed, the gas stream is treated with a quantity of one or more agents so that the<br>
one or more agents is carried out of the gas treater 120 for delivery to an animal. For<br>
some applications and temperature range requirements, it may be desirable to position<br>
the gas treater 120 immediately adjacent the location to which the treated gas is to be<br>
delivered.<br>
In the event that heating and humidification of the gas is also desired and the<br>
appropriate components are also deployed in the gas treater 120, then in chamber 128,<br>
the gas is also simultaneously heated and humidified to the proper physiological range<br>
by regulation of the heating element 134 and liquid content of the layers 130-132 such<br>
that the temperature of gas exiting chamber 128 is within a preselected physiological<br>
temperature range (preferably 35° to 40°C, though any desired temperature range can<br>
be preselected), and within a preselected range of relative humidity (preferably above<br>
40% relative humidity, such as in the range of 80-95% relative humidity). If the<br>
apparatus is operated with the gas treater 120 not charged with liquid agent and/or<br>
humidifying solution either because the user forgot to manually charge it before<br>
initiating operation, or the apparatus was sold without a pre-charge of liquid (i.e., in a<br>
dry state), the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber of the gas treater 120 will be<br>
detected to be below the predetermined threshold and the alarm will be activated,<br>
alerting the user that the gas treater 120 requires charging of liquid. The apparatus will<br>
automatically issue an alarm to alert a user to the need for charging the gas treater 120<br><br><br>
with liquid agent and/or humidifying solution, thereby avoiding further delivery of<br>
unhydrated gas into an animal.<br>
With further reference to Figure 5, the control module 140 monitors the relative<br>
humidity of the gas exiting the chamber and further regulates the temperature of the gas<br>
in the chamber 128. In particular, the microcontroller 142 generates a recharge signal<br>
when the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber drops below the predetennined<br>
relative humidity threshold, indicating that the liquid supply in the gas treater 120<br>
requires replenishing. An audible alarm is issued by the buzzer* 147 and/or a visual<br>
alarm is issued by LED 148A to warn the medical attendant or user that the gas treater<br>
120 requires recharging. Preferably, the microcontroller 142 continues the alarm until<br>
the humidity in the chamber returns to a level above the predetermined relative<br>
humidity threshold, which will occur when the gas treater 120 is recharged with liquid.<br>
Moreover, the microcontroller 142 will issue a second alarm, such as by energizing<br>
LED 148B, when the relative humidity level of gas in the gas treater 120 drops below<br>
the critical relative humidity threshold, at which point electrical power to the heating<br>
element 134 is terminated. In addition, the microcontroller 142 controls the<br>
temperature of the gas by controlling electrical power supplied to the heating element<br>
134.<br>
In some cases, the controlled humidity of the gas stream is more important than<br>
controlled heating. For those applications, the apparatus would include only those<br>
components necessary to treat the gas stream with one or more agents (according to the<br>
embodiments of Figures 7-13) and to humidify the gas stream. Furthermore,<br>
monitoring the humidity of the gas stream is also optional for certain applications. For<br>
example, treating the gas stream with a dry agent may not normally require heating or<br>
humidification.<br>
The method and apparatus of this invention can be utilized for many medical<br>
procedures requiring the provision of heated and humidified gas. The optional<br>
filtration may also be utilized according to the sterility of gas required for the<br>
procedure. The gas is chosen according to the procedure to be performed and can be<br>
any medically useful gas, such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrous oxide, argon, helium,<br>
nitrogen and room air and other inert gases. Preferable gases for endoscopy are carbon<br>
dioxide and nitrous oxide. A combination of the above gases can also be used, i.e.,<br>
100% of a single gas need not be used. The procedure is preferably endoscopy such as<br><br>
laparoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroscopy, bronchoscopy, and thoracoscopy. However, it<br>
may also be utilized for providing heated and humidified oxygen or any anesthetic<br>
gases or combination of gases for breathing, for example, or to administer anesthesia or<br>
breathing therapy. In particular, the compact size of the apparatus make the invention<br>
portable and thus suitable for uses requiring portability. The gas delivery device that<br>
provides the direct contact to the patient should be selected according to the medical<br>
procedure to be performed as known to those skilled in the art. The gas that is<br>
conditioned by the apparatus may be pressure controlled, volumetrically controlled or<br>
both.<br>
In some cases, it is desired to supply some agents of pharmacologic material,<br>
separate from other agents (which, as discussed above, could be pharmacologic agents)<br>
which may be supplied by the heater/hydrator 120. Depending upon the agent, it may<br>
be desirable to use the heater/hydrator to humidify and heat the insufflation gas, and<br>
supply the agent separately. Alternatively, one or more agents could be supplied using<br>
a heater/hydrator while one or more additional agents could be supplied into the gas<br>
stream separately.<br>
Agents can be supplied through a gas stream, for example, during a<br>
laparoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroscopy, and/or thoracoscopy, or any other procedure<br>
that requires distention. For example, while these procedures are presently done under<br>
general anesthesia, where uses of therapeutic doses of anesthesia administered, by way<br>
of example, and not of limitation, into the abdomen during surgery, less, or no general<br>
anesthesia may be needed, making for faster surgeries, and quicker patient recovery.<br>
For example, an appendectomy, cholycysectomy, or tubal ligation might be done<br>
without general anesthesia.<br>
While any type of agent could be delivered using the invention, examples of<br>
particular agents that might be delivered in a gas stream during a procedure include<br>
anesthetic agents, analgesic agents, chemotherapy agents, anti-infective agents, and<br>
anti-adhesion agents.<br>

carboxymemylcellulose, Carboxymethylcellulose, Polyethylene glycol, Dextran 70 and<br>
Icodextrin 4%.<br>
The preceding are liquids, solutions or gels which it is believed within the skill<br>
of those in the art to use in the present invention. Also known are commercial anti-<br>
adhesion barriers such as hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose, oxidized regenerated<br>
cellulose, polyethylene oxide-oxidized regenerated cellulose, expanded<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene and pericardial patch.<br>
The use of these in the present invention may require shredding, pulverizing or<br>
powdering together with mixing them with a liquid to make them usable in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention contemplates use of yet to be invented agents of the<br>
above classes, as well as any of those drugs of the above classes which have not been<br>
listed.<br>
Referring to Figures 16-20, there are shown embodiments of the present<br>
invention which are thought to be particularly useful in providing agents to be<br>
delivered, along with insufflation gas, whether treated or not, to the abdomen of a<br>
patient. There is shown an insufflation device, at least one structure defining at least<br>
one fluid flow path extending at least a portion of the distance between the insufflation<br>
device and the abdomen of a patient, and a chamber adapted to be coupled to the at<br>
least one structure and adapted to supply an agent to the interior of the abdomen<br>
through the at least one structure.<br>
Figure 16 shows an apparatus comprising an insufflation device 915, which may<br>
be such as the Stortz Model 26012 mentioned above, or any other insufflation device<br>
that supplies insufflation gas to a surgical site. The insufflation device 915 has an<br>
outlet 916 through which it supplies insufflation gas.<br>
There is optionally provided downstream of the insufflation device 915, and in<br>
fluid communication therewith, the heater/hydrator 120 of the present invention. The<br>
heater/hydrator 120 has an inlet 917 and an outlet 918. A first conduit 919 connects the<br><br>
insufflation device outlet 916 with the inlet 917 of the heater/hydrator 120, thus placing<br>
the insufflation device 915 in fluid communication with the heater/hydrator 120.<br>
In any of the embodiments set forth herein, conduits may be short or long, wide<br>
or narrow. In some cases, the conduits may be separate pieces from devices they are in<br>
fluid communication with, while in other cases the conduit may be formed together<br>
with such devices.. In some cases, various devices may be connected or coupled<br>
together without conduits between them. In some cases, various devices may be<br>
formed as a single device with multiple chambers. All such embodiments are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
The addition of an agent into the gas stream which is going into the patient's<br>
abdomen may be beneficial whether or not the insufflation gas is dry or humidified, or<br>
warm or cold. The scope of the present invention covers the addition of an agent under<br>
any conditions. The preferred method is one in which the insufflation gas is heated and<br>
humidified.<br>
A second conduit 920 is connected at its first end 920A to the outlet 918 of the<br>
heater/hydrator 120, and is open at its second end 920B. Either end may include one or<br>
more connectors, such as, for example, a Luer lock. During surgery, the second<br>
conduit may be connected to, or placed in fluid communication with trocar assembly<br>
921 which has previously been placed into the abdomen 922 of the patient P, thus<br>
placing the heater/hydrator in fluid communication with the patient's abdomen. A<br>
Veres needle or other device could also be used to provide access to the abdomen<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. The first conduit 919, or<br>
second conduit 920, may have a filter attached thereto.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, an agent chamber 925 is provided<br>
external and separate of the heater/hydrator 120. The agent chamber 925 has at least an<br>
outlet 926. A third conduit 927 is connected at its first end 927A to the outlet 926 of<br>
the agent chamber. The third conduit 927, at its other end 927B, may be in flow<br>
communication with the trocar assembly 921 (or could be in flow communication with<br>
conduit 920 if an appropriate connector was used).<br>
A two-inlet trocar assembly 930 (Figure 31) may be provided. Or, if desired, a<br>
modified trocar 933 (Figure 32) may be provided. Since the third conduit is open to<br>
atmosphere, some pressure source, other than the insufflation device 915, is employed<br><br>
to drive the agent in the agent chamber 925 into the insufflation gas stream. An<br>
example pressure source is described below.<br>
A dispersion device 948 may be used to promote the entry of the agent into the<br>
abdomen 922 of the patient P as an aerosol spray, mist, fog or vapor. It is believed that<br>
the dispersion device will promote the effectiveness of the agent.<br>
The dispersion device placement may depend on where and how the agent is<br>
introduced to the insufflation gas stream. It is believed that when the agent chamber<br>
925 is not connected in line, the dispersion device may be anywhere in the third conduit<br>
927 or in the trocar 921.<br>
Referring now to Figure 17, a modification of the construction shown in Figure<br>
16 is provided. In this embodiment, the insufflation device 915 having outlet 916 is<br>
again provided. The heater/hydrator 120 has its inlet 917 connected to the outlet 916 of<br>
insufflation device 915 by the first conduit 919. However, in this embodiment, the<br>
modified agent chamber 935 (referred to as modified because of having an inlet and an<br>
outlet), having an inlet 936, and an outlet 937, is placed in-line with the heater/hydrator<br>
120 and connected thereto by second conduit 920. Therefore, the pressure of the<br>
insufflation gas may be used to drive the agent, if desired. The term "modified agent<br>
chamber" is used for convenience and is not meant to create a special definition of<br>
either "agent chamber" or "modified agent chamber" in the claims. As used in the<br>
claims, the term "agent chamber" is meant to refer broadly to any chamber that may<br>
contain an agent.<br>
A fourth conduit 938 is connected to the outlet 937 of agent chamber 935. The<br>
fourth conduit 938 may be used to place the agent chamber 935 in fluid communication<br>
with the trocar assembly 921 in the abdomen 922 of a patient P during a surgical<br>
procedure. The dispersion device 948 may be anywhere downstream of the modified<br>
agent chamber 935, such as interposed or connected to the fourth conduit 938. As<br>
discussed above, a device other than a trocar 921 could be used to provide access to the<br>
abdomen, such as, for example, a Veres needle.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that, depending on the nature of the<br>
dispersion device 948, it may be placed in the conduits described herein, with the fluid<br>
flowing through the dispersion device 948, or around it, or, the dispersion device 948<br>
could surround the conduit. Depending on the application, for any particular conduit,<br>
there may be a dispersion device both, in a conduit, and external to it.<br><br>
In Figure 18, the agent chamber 925 is connected upstream of the<br>
heater/hydrator 120. It is connected in flow communication with the heater/hydrator<br>
120 by fifth conduit 940. Fifth conduit 940 may be connected anywhere between the<br>
outlet 916 of the insufflation device 915 and the inlet 917 of the heater/hydrator 120 to<br>
place the agent chamber 925 in flow communication with the heater/hydrator 120. As<br>
before, second conduit 920 is connected to the outlet 918 of the heater/hydrator 120,<br>
and places the heater/hydrator 120 in fluid communication with the patient's abdomen<br>
through trocar assembly 921. As discussed above, a device other than a trocar 921<br>
could be used to provide access to the abdomen, such as, for example, a Veres needle.<br>
Since the agent chamber 925 is connected in parallel with the insufflation<br>
device 915, the dispersion device 948 may be connected or placed anywhere<br>
downstream of the agent chamber 925, for example, in the second conduit 920.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 19 is similar to that shown in Figure 17,<br>
except that the modified agent chamber 935 having inlet 936 and outlet 937 is placed<br>
upstream of the heater/hydrator 120, instead of downstream thereof. First conduit 919<br>
may now be connected between the outlet 916 of the insufflation device 915 and the<br>
inlet 936 of the modified agent chamber, thus placing the modified agent chamber 935<br>
in fluid communication with the insufflation device 915.<br>
A sixth conduit 941 connects the outlet 937 of the modified agent chamber 935<br>
to the inlet 917 of the heater/hydrator 120. A seventh conduit 942 is connected to the<br>
outlet 918 of the heater/hydrator 120. Seventh conduit 942 may be placed in fluid<br>
communication with a trocar 921 assembly which has previously been placed in the<br>
abdomen 922 of a patient P during a surgical procedure. As. discussed above, a device<br>
other than a trocar 921 could be used to provide access to the abdomen, such as, for<br>
example, a Veres needle. When gas is flowing from the insufflation device 915, and<br>
there is agent remaining in the modified agent chamber 935, the agent may be delivered<br>
into the abdomen 922 of the patient P. As before, dispersion device 948 may be placed<br>
anywhere downstream of the agent chamber, such as interposed in, or connected to<br>
seventh conduit 942.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 20 is similar to the embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 18, except that the agent chamber 925, having outlet 926 is connected<br>
downstream of the heater/hydrator 120, instead of upstream. First conduit 919 is<br>
connected between the outlet 916 of the insufflation device 915 and the inlet 917 of the<br><br>
heater/hydrator, thereby placing heater/hydrator 120 in fluid or flow communication<br>
with the insufflation device 915.<br>
Second conduit 920 is connected to the outlet 918 of the heater/hydrator 120.<br>
As before, second conduit 920 may be placed in flow communication with a trocar<br>
assembly 921 that has been placed into the abdomen 922 of a patient P during a<br>
surgical procedure. As discussed above, a device other than a trocar 921 could be<br>
used to provide access to the abdomen, such as, for example, a Veres needle. The<br>
outlet 926 of the agent chamber 925 has an eighth conduit 943 connected thereto. The<br>
other end of eighth conduit 943 may be connected in flow communication with the gas<br>
stream coming from the heater/hydrator anywhere between the outlet 918 of the<br>
heater/hydrator 120 and the trocar assembly 921. Dispersion device 948 may be placed<br>
anywhere downstream of the agent chamber 925, such as being interposed in, or<br>
connected to, second conduit 920. When pressure is applied to the agent in the agent<br>
chamber 925, whether or not gas is flowing from the insufflation device 915, agent may<br>
be supplied into the abdomen 922 of the patient P.<br>
Depending on the application, the constructions shown in Figs. 1-20 may be<br>
combined or duplicated to achieve the desired results. For example, one or more agents<br>
may be introduced through the heater/hydrator 120, and one or more agents may be<br>
introduced through one or more agent chambers (925,935). Also, any of the chambers<br>
shown may be single or multiple chambers, so as to provide for the addition of multiple<br>
agents. The gas may be heated and/or humidified, as desired. The chambers may be<br>
empty chambers, or have various means to absorb or adsorb liquid in them.<br>
Referring now to Figure 21, there is shown one way in which agent may be<br>
introduced into an agent chamber (925,935). Although modified agent chamber 935 is<br>
illustrated in Figure 21, the apparatus shown will also work with agent chamber 925.<br>
An external port 950 is provided, which may have a closure member 968 to regulate<br>
flow through the port 950, into which syringe 951 containing the desired amount of<br>
agent may be inserted. At the proper time, the surgeon, anesthetist, or other medical<br>
personnel, will open the closure member 968, if present, and depress the plunger 952 of<br>
syringe 951 to inject the agent into the agent chamber (925,935), where it will travel to<br>
the patient's abdomen in the manner previously described.<br>
Referring now to Figure 22, there is shown another device that may serve to<br>
introduce agent into an agent chamber (925,935) in various embodiments of the present<br><br>
invention. In this embodiment, pump 954 is used to deliver the agent to the agent<br>
chamber (925,935). An external port 950 is provided to which pump 954, such as a<br>
peristaltic or other suitable type pump, is connected. A closure member 968 may be<br>
provided to regulate the flow into the port 150. A reservoir (not shown) containing at<br>
least the desired amount of agent is provided.<br>
At the proper time, the surgeon, anesthetist, or other medical personnel, will<br>
open the closure member 968, if present, activate the pump 954 to supply the desired<br>
amount of the agent into the agent chamber (925,935), where it will travel to the<br>
patients abdomen in the manner previously described. Note that in any of the<br>
embodiment discussed herein, closure member 968 could be an adjustable valve.<br>
Referring now to Figure 23, there is shown a still further device mat may serve<br>
to introduce agent into an agent chamber (925, 935) in embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment, a pressurized cylinder 956 which has been pre-charged<br>
with a desired amount of agent is used to deliver the agent to the agent chamber (925,<br>
935). An external port 950 is provided to which pressurized cylinder 956 is connected.<br>
A closure member 968 is interposed between cylinder 956 and port 950. The pre-<br>
charged cylinder, in addition to having a desired amount of agent contained therein,<br>
may have a predetermined amount of a pressurizing agent, such as an inert gas,<br>
contained therein, and may have apparatus (e.g. an electronically controlled valve) to<br>
cause the release of the agent at the desired time. At the proper time, the surgeon,<br>
anesthetist, or other medical personnel, may open the closure member 968, if present,<br>
and activate the release apparatus to supply the desired amount of the agent into the<br>
agent chamber, where it will travel to the patients abdomen in the manner previously<br>
described.<br>
Referring now to Figure 24, there is shown yet another device which may serve<br>
to introduce agent into an agent chamber (925, 935) of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, a flexible bag 958 containing a desired amount of agent is connected by<br>
tubing 959 to the external port 950. Apparatus (e.g. an adjustable valve) to control the<br>
release of the agent from the flexible bag 958 may, or may not, be provided, depending<br>
on the application. The closure member 968 may serve as the release apparatus. At the<br>
desired time in the surgery, the flexible bag 958 will be squeezed, the release apparatus,<br>
if present, will be operated, and the agent will be forced into the agent chamber (925,<br>
935).<br><br>
It should be understood that all of the ways of introducing the agent into the<br>
agent chamber (925,935) shown in Figures 21-24 will work with any of the<br>
embodiments of the invention shown in Figures 16-20. It should further be understood<br>
that other methods of introducing agent into the chamber (925, 935) may be used<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Referring now to Figures 25-28, if a separate agent chamber is not desired for<br>
whatever reason, the syringe 951, pump 954, pressurized cylinder 956 and flexible bag<br>
. 958 may be used by themselves to supply agent to the embodiments of the invention<br>
shown in Figures 16-20. An appropriate external port or connector 965 may be placed<br>
in line in the appropriate conduit so that the external port or connector 965 will be in<br>
the flow path of the insufflation gas. The operation of the various devices will be as<br>
just described with regard to Figures 21-24.<br>
Referring now to Figure 29, there is shown an additional device that may serve<br>
as the agent chamber (925,935) of the present invention. Piezoelectric chamber 961<br>
comprises a hollow chamber 962 having an inlet 963 and an outlet 964. The<br>
piezoelectric chamber is connected in flow communication with the appropriate conduit<br>
to place it in the stream of the insufflation gas 970 when the insufflation device is in<br>
operation. In the hollow chamber 962 is placed a desired quantity of agent 966 in<br>
liquid form. The agent 966 will be placed in the chamber with the piezoelectric crystal<br>
965. Piezoelectric crystal 965 may then be energized to activate the crystal. Activation<br>
of the crystal 965 may cause the molecules of the agent to vibrate at such speeds as to<br>
produce an agent fog 967, which may be drawn into the insufflation gas stream 970 and<br>
delivered to the patient's abdomen.<br>
With reference to Figure 30, there is shown a further alternative embodiment of<br>
the invention which is believed useful for the administration of agent into the abdomen<br>
of a patient This embodiment of the invention involves the use of a modified syringe<br>
971 being used with a trocar 972. The trocar 972 has a tubular portion 973 and an<br>
enlarged top portion 974. The modified syringe 971 has a normally sized hollow body<br>
portion 978 which sealingly accepts the plunger 979 for reciprocal movement in the<br>
body portion 978. Attached to, or integral with, the body portion 978 is an elongated,<br>
hollow, tubular, lower portion 980 having a dispersion device 948 mounted at the distal<br>
end thereof.<br><br>
In use, agent is drawn into the modified syringe assembly 971, either through a<br>
needle, or the lower tubular portion 980. If not already attached, the lower tubular<br>
portion 980 is attached, and the modified syringe 971 is placed into the trocar assembly<br>
972, with the lower tubular portion 980, and the dispersion device 948, slidably fitting<br>
in the tubular portion of the trocar 972.<br>
The elongated tubular portion 980 of the modified syringe should be long<br>
enough so that when the modified syringe 971 is inserted in the trocar, the distal end<br>
980A of the lower tubular portion 980 extends past the end of the tubular portion 973 of<br>
the trocar 972. In this manner, during surgery, when it is desired to add agent to the<br>
abdomen, and the modified syringe 971 is fully inserted into the trocar 972, the<br>
dispersion device 948 may actually be inside the pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, when<br>
the plunger 979 is depressed, the agent that has previously been drawn into the<br>
modified syringe 971 may be forced through the dispersion device 948, and may<br>
directly enter the abdomen as an aerosol, spray, mist, fog or vapor, depending on the<br>
dispersion device 948 used, and the agent Some agents may not be capable of being<br>
dispersed in all forms.<br>
Referring now to Figure 31, there is shown a two-inlet trocar 930. Two-inlet<br>
trocar 930 is similar in some respects to trocars known in the art in that it has a tubular<br>
body portion 975, having an enlarged top portion 975A and has a single inlet 976 for<br>
the admission of insufflation gas, such as that which may be supplied from insufflation<br>
device 915. Due to the potential desirability of introducing the agent into the<br>
insufflation gas stream right at the trocar, two-inlet trocar 930 with second inlet 977<br>
may be desirable. When desired, the insufflation gas stream may enter the two-inlet<br>
trocar 930 through first inlet 976, and the agent gas stream may enter the trocar through<br>
the second inlet 977 (or vice versa).<br>
A modification of the trocar construction shown in Figure 31 is shown in Figure<br>
32. Modified trocar 933 is shown. Modified trocar 933 has a tubular body portion 975<br>
and enlarged top portion 974 as before. In addition, it has inlet 976. However, instead<br>
of having a second inlet 977, it has a branch inlet 934 which branches off the inlet 976<br>
to provide for the agent stream to be connected directly to the modified trocar 933, but<br>
without the provision of an entirely separate second inlet. A dispersion device 948 is<br>
optionally provided at the distal end of the branch outlet 934. Closure members 968 are<br>
optionally provided.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 33, a further embodiment of the invention, which is, in<br>
some respects similar to the embodiment shown in Figure 32, is shown. This<br>
embodiment of the invention uses most of the construction of Figure 32 in that the<br>
modified trocar 933 having a lower tubular portion 975 and enlarged top portion 974 is<br>
used with a single inlet 976 and a branch outlet 934. In this modification, the branch<br>
inlet is sized and shaped to accommodate a pressurized aerosol spray can 981 which has<br>
a desired amount of agent and propellant contained therein.<br>
The pressurized container or spray can 981 has a nozzle»982 with an orifice that<br>
should be chosen, depending on the agent being used, to create an aerosol spray, mist,<br>
fog, or vapor, if possible. The nozzle 982 may be adapted to be press fit onto the<br>
branch inlet 934. Because the nozzle may create the desired dispersion, dispersion<br>
device 948 may be omitted in this embodiment of the invention, but could also be<br>
included, if desired.<br>
Referring now to Figure 34, there is shown a flow chart illustrating a series of<br>
steps in which various embodiments of the invention may be used. At Box 1000, the<br>
first step is to gain access to the abdomen 922 of the patient P. This may be done by<br>
any of several well known surgical techniques known to those skilled in the art of<br>
surgery, and will usually involve making a surgical incision in the patient's abdomen<br>
and inserting a trocar therein.<br>
Next (Box 1010) a gas stream of insufflation gas may be introduced into the<br>
patient's abdomen 922. This will involve the steps of providing an insufflation device<br>
120, creating a flow path between the insufflation device and the trocar, and initially<br>
inflating the patient's abdomen with about 2-3 liters of insufflation gas. After the<br>
initial inflation of the patient's abdomen, insufflation gas may continue to flow into the<br>
abdomen at the desired rate or may cease to flow depending upon the particular<br>
circumstances.<br>
The agent, or agent stream may then be introduced into the pneumoperitoneum<br>
along with the insufflation gas (Box 1020). A predetermined concentration suitable for<br>
a particular procedure may be chosen.<br>
Once the desired concentration of agent has been determined for the surgical<br>
procedure being performed, there are several ways the agent may be introduced into the<br>
pneumoperitoneum, as described above.<br><br>
Regardless of the method used, when the desired amount of agent has been<br>
introduced, the flow of agent or agent stream will be shut off (Box 1030).<br>
Throughout this application, various patents publications are referenced. The<br>
disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this<br>
invention pertains.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
Title: An apparatus for delivering an agent to the abdomen.<br>
An apparatus for introducing at least one agent into the abdomen of a patient<br>
comprising: an insufflation device to provide pressure and volumetrically<br>
controlled gas in a manner suitable for laparoscopic surgery in a volume to<br>
provide full insufflation of the abdominal cavity; a heater/hydrator connected to<br>
the insufflation device downstream thereof, the heater/hydrator having a heater<br>
