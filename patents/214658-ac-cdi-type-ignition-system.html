				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
This invention relates to an AC-CDI type ignition system, and more particularly to an AC-CDI type ignition system wherein an AC-CDI main switch of a 2-circuit 2-<br>
contact construction is not used but a DC-CDI main switch of a 1 -circuit 2 -contact construction is used and starting of a vehicle engine is permitted when the CDI main switch is operated normally.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
FIG. 7 shows an example of a block diagram of essential part of a conventional AC-CDI type ignition system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the AC-CDI (CAPACITIVE DISCHARGE IGNITION) type ignition system 30 includes an AC CDI main switch 31, an AC-CDI unit 32 including killing means, an ac generator 33, a regulator-rectifier 34, a battery 35, a pulser coil 37, an ignition coil 38 and an ignition plug 39.<br>
An ac voltage Ve of an exciter coil of the ac generator 33 is used to drive the ignition coil 38, and an ac voltage Vc of a charge coil is used to charge the battery 35 via the regulator- rectifier 34.<br>
The pulsar coil 37 detects a timing at which the ignition plug 39 should be ignited, and applies a pulsar<br>
signal S30 to the AC-CDI unit 32.<br>
The AC-CDI unit 32 outputs a coil driving signal S31 in response to the pulsar signal S30 to drive the ignition coil 38 to ignite the ignition plug 39.<br>
The AC-CDI main switch 31 includes a switch of a 1-circuit 2-contact construction which either pulls down an input to the killing means to the ground in order to short-circuit the high voltage primary side of the ignition coil 38 to stop ignition of the ignition plug 39 or opens the input to the killing means in order to drive the ignition coil 38 to permit ignition of the ignition plug 39, and another switch of a 2 -circuit 2-contact construction which operates in an interlocking relationship with the switch of a 1-circuit 2-contact construction for switching on or off supply of a dc voltage Vb of the battery 35 to a dc load (DC load) of the vehicle.<br>
In this manner, the AC-CDI type ignition system is an ignition system wherein the ac voltage Ve of the exciter coil of the ac generator is used as a voltage for driving the ignition coil and the vehicle engine is started or<br><br>
stopped by an on-or off-operation of the AC-CDI main switch formed from 2 circuits and 2 contacts.<br>
However, the conventional AC-CDI type ignition system has a subject in that it is required to employ an expensive AC-CDI main switch of a 2-circuit 2-contact construction which includes a complicated 2-circuit interlocking mechanism and is large in size, and an inexpensive DC-CDI main switch of a 1-circuit 2-contact construction which has a simple construction cannot be used.<br>
Further, as proposed in Japanese Patent Application No. Heisei 7-252232 by the assignee of the present invention, a vehicle engine ignition system is available wherein, in order to prevent an engine from being started by an abnormal operation of a CDI main switch, a non-linear circuit is incorporated in the inside of the CDI main switch and the non-linear circuit is rendered operative in response to an on-operation of the CDI main switch so as to generate a particular voltage or current, and only when the particular voltage or current is detected, the engine is<br>
started.However, the conventional AC-CDI type ignition apparatus has a subject in that it is difficult to incorporate a non-linear circuit in the inside of an AC-CDI main switch in order to prevent an engine from being started by an abnormal operation because the AC-CDI main switch has a complicated 2-circuit interlocking mechanism.<br>
[Subject to Be Solved by the Invention] The present invention has been made to solve the subjects of the prior art described above, and it is a first object of the present invention to provide an AC-CDI type ignition system wherein a vehicle engine can be started or stopped by an on-or off -operation of a DC-CDI main switch of a 1-circuit 2-contact construction.<br>

 [Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
The present invention will be described below in connection with an embodiment shown in the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of essential part of an AC-CDI type ignition system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an AC-CDI (CAPACITIVE DISCHARGE IGNITION) type ignition system 1 includes a DC-CDI main switch 2, an AC-CDI unit 3, an ac generator 6, a regulator-rectifier 7, a battery 8, a pulser coil 10, an ignition coil 11, and an ignition plug 12.  The AC-CDI unit 3 includes ignition control means 4 and coil driving means<br>
An ac voltage ve of an exciter coil of the ac generator 6 is used to drive the ignition coil 11 and is supplied to a terminal Tl of the coil driving means 5.<br>
An ac voltage Vc of a charge coil is used to charge the battery 8 via the regulator- rectifier 7.<br>
The DC-CDI main switch 2 is a switch of a 1-circuit 2-contact construction having a transfer contact structure, and applies, by an on-operation thereof, a dc voltage Vb (12 V) of the battery to a terminal T2 of the ignition control means 4 of the AC-CDI unit 3 to put the ignition control means 4 into an enabled state, but puts, by an off-operation thereof, the terminal T2 of the ignition control means 4 into an open state.<br>
The pulser coil 10 detects a timing at which the ignition plug 12 should be ignited, and applies a pulser signal S1 to a terminal T3 of the ignition control means 4 of the AC-CDI unit 3.<br>
The ignition control means 4 is put into an enabled condition by an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2,<br>
and outputs a trigger signal S2 in response to the pulser signal S1 from the pulser coil 10 to the coil driving means 5.<br>
The coil driving means 5 of the AC-CDI unit 3 outputs a coil driving signal S3 in response to the trigger signal S2 to drive the ignition coil 11 to ignite the ignition plug 12 to start an engine.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of an AC-GDI unit according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the AC-CDI unit 3-1 includes ignition control means 4-1 and coil driving means 5.<br>
In response to an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2, the dc voltage Vb of the battery 8 is applied to the terminal T2 of the ignition control means 4-1, and the dc voltage is applied to the collector of a transistor TR1 and the emitter of another transistor TR2 so that they are put into an enabled state.<br>
If the pulser signal S1 is applied to the terminal T3 of the ignition control means 4-1, then the transistor TR1 is put into an on-state to put the transistor TR2 into an on-state so that the transistor TR2 outputs a trigger<br>
signal S2.<br>
The ac voltage Ve of the exciter coil of the ac generator 6 is supplied to the terminal Tl of the coil driving means 5 so that charge is accumulated into a capacitor C4 via a diode D2.<br>
When the trigger signal S2 is applied from the ignition control means 4-1 to the gate electrode of a thyristor SCR1 of the coil driving means 5, then the thyristor SCRl is put into a conducting state, whereupon the charge accumulated in the capacitor C4 is discharged by a closed loop which is formed from the capacitor C4, the thyristor SCRl and the primary side coil of the ignition coil 11 at a terminal T4 to ignite the ignition plug 12 with a voltage induced in the secondary side coil of the ignition coil 11.<br>
If the terminal T2 of the ignition control means 4-1 is put into an open state by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2, then since a dc voltage is not applied to the collector of the transistor TR1 nor the emitter of the transistor TR2 of the ignition control means 4-1, the<br>
ignition control means 4-1 does not output a trigger signal S2 and is put into a disabled state.<br>
In this manner, the AC-CDI type ignition system includes the ignition control means in the AC-CDI unit and can start or stop the vehicle engine by an on-or off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch.<br>
FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 are block diagrams of essential part of AC-CDI units according to the present invention.<br>
The AC-CDI units shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 employ countermeasures for preventing an engine from being started by an abnormal operation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the AC-CDI unit 3-2 includes a constant voltage power supply 13, ignition control means 4-2, and coil driving means 5.  The ignition control means 4-2 includes battery voltage detection means 14, a noise cut filter 15, and ignition signal generation means 16. <br>
The constant voltage power supply 13 produces a constant dc voltage Vcc from an ac voltage Ve of an exciter<br>
coil and supplies the constant dc voltage Vcc to the battery voltage detection means 14 and the ignition signal generation means 16.<br>
The battery voltage detection means 14 outputs a detection signal S4 to the ignition signal generation means 16 only when the voltage applied to the terminal T2 by an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2 is a dc voltage Vb.<br>
The noise cut filter 15 removes unnecessary high frequency components from the pulser signal S1 inputted to the terminal T3 and outputs a resulting pulser signal S5 to the ignition signal generation means 16.<br>
When the battery voltage detection means 14 outputs the detection signal S4 to the ignition signal generation means 16, the ignition signal generation means 16 outputs, when the pulser signal S5 is inputted thereto, a trigger signal S6 to the coil driving means 5 in response to the pulser signal S5, and the coil driving means 5 outputs a coil driving signal S7 to the terminal T4 in response to the trigger signal S6 to drive the ignition coil 11.<br>
When the battery voltage detection means 14 does not output the detection signal S4 to the ignition signal generation means 16, the ignition signal generation means 16 pulls down the potential to the terminal T4 connected to the primary side coil of the ignition coil 11 to zero irrespective of the pulser signal 55.<br>
When the terminal T2 is connected to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2, since the battery voltage detection means 14 does not output the detection signal S4 to the ignition signal generation means 16, the ignition signal generation means 16 pulls down the potential at the terminal T4 connected to the primary side of the ignition coil 11 to zero irrespective of the pulser signal S5 to put the AC-CDI unit 3-2 into a disabled state.<br>
In this manner, since the AC-CDI type ignition apparatus includes the battery voltage detection means 14 and the ignition signal generation means 16 in the AC-CDI unit and connects the terminal T2 to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 2, it cannot apply a voltage to the terminal T2, and the engine cannot be<br>
started by an abnormal operation,<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of essential part of another AC-CDI unit according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the AC-CDI unit 3-3 includes a wind comparator 18, change-over means 19, ignition control means 4, and coil driving means 5.<br>
A Zener diode ZD2 is incorporated in a DC-CDI main switch 17 such that, by an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 17, the dc voltage Vb of the battery 8 is applied to the terminal T2 while a voltage VI (Vb - Vz2) which is a difference when a breakdown voltage Vz2 of the Zener diode ZD2 is subtracted from the dc voltage Vb of the battery 8 is applied to the terminal T5.<br>
The wind comparator 18 outputs a discrimination signal S8 to the change-over means 19 when the voltage VI applied to the terminal T5 is within a predetermined voltage range.<br>
The change-over means 19 applies the dc voltage Vb applied to the terminal T2 to the ignition control means 4<br>
in response to the discrimination signal S8.<br>
The ignition control means 4 outputs a trigger signal S9 to the coil driving means 5 only when an ANDing requirement between the dc voltage Vb and the pulser signal S1 inputted to the terminal T3 is satisfied, and the coil driving means 5 outputs a coil driving signal S10 to the terminal T4 in response to the trigger signal S9 to drive the ignition coil 11.<br>
When the terminal T5 is connected to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 17, the wind comparator 18 discriminates that the voltage VI at the terminal T5 is not within the predetermined voltage range, and does not output the discrimination signal S8 to the change-over means 19.<br>
Therefore, since the ANDing requirement between the dc voltage Vb and the pulser signal S1 inputted to the terminal T3 is not satisfied, the ignition control means 4 does not output the trigger signal S9, and the AC-CDI unit 3-3 is put into a disabled state.<br>
Since the AC-CDI type ignition system includes the wind comparator and the ignition control means in the AC-CDI unit and connects the terminal T5 to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch in this manner, no voltage can be applied to the terminal T5, and since the engine cannot be started unless a voltage within the predetermined range is applied to the terminal T5, the engine cannot be started by an abnormal operation.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of essential part of a further AC-CDI unit according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the AC-CDI unit 3-4 includes a digital wind comparator 21, ignition control means 4, and coil driving means 5. The wind comparator 21 includes an A/D converter 22, another A/D converter 23, and battery voltage discrimination means 24.<br>
f iQOlO 1<br>
A Zener diode ZD2 is incorporated in the DC-CDI main switch 17, and the dc voltage Vb of the battery 8 is applied to the terminal T2 by an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 17 while a voltage V1 (Vb - Vz2) which is a difference when a breakdown voltage Vz2 of the Zener diode<br>
ZD2 is subtracted from the dc voltage Vb of the battery 8 is applied to the terminal T6.<br>
The dc voltage Vb at the terminal T2 is divided by a resistor RIO and another resistor Rll to produce another voltage V2, which is inputted to the A/D converter 22 and converted by the A/D converter 22 into a digital signal Sll to be inputted to the voltage discrimination means 24.<br>
The voltage VI at the terminal T6 is divided by a resistor R12 and another resistor R13 to produce another voltage V3, which is inputted to the A/D converter 23 and converted by the A/D converter 23 into a digital signal S12 to be inputted to the voltage discrimination means 24.<br>
The voltage discrimination means 24 includes a central processing unit (CPU) and discriminates whether or not the digital signal Sll and the digital signal S12 inputted thereto are within predetermined respective ranges. Only when both of the digital signal Sll and the digital signal S12 are within the predetermined respective ranges, the voltage discrimination means 24 outputs a discrimination signal S13 to the ignition control means 4.<br>
The ignition control means 4 outputs a trigger signal S14 to the coil driving means 5 only when the discrimination signal S13 and pulser signal S1 inputted to the terminal T3 satisfy an ANDing requirement, and the coil driving means 5 outputs a coil driving signal S15 to the terminal T4 in response to the trigger signal S14 to drive the ignition coil 11.<br>
When the terminal T6 is connected to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch 17, the wind comparator 21 does not output the discrimination signal S13 to the ignition control means 4 unless the dc voltage Vb is applied to the terminal T2 and the voltage V1 is applied to the terminal T6.<br>
Therefore, since the ANDing requirement between the discrimination signal S13 and the pulser signal S1 inputted to the terminal T3 is not satisfied, the ignition control means 4 does not output the trigger signal S14, and the AC-<br>
CDI unit 3-4 is put into a disabled state. <br>
Since the AC-CDI type ignition system includes the<br>
digital wind comparator and the ignition control means in the AC-CDI unit and connects the terminal T6 to the ground by an off-operation of the DC-CDI main switch in this manner, no voltage can be applied to the terminal T6, and since the engine cannot be started unless voltages within the predetermined ranges are applied to the terminal T2 and the terminal T6, the engine cannot be started by an abnormal operation.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of essential part of a still further AC-CDI unit according to the present invention,<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, in order to prevent starting of the engine by an abnormal operation, a resistor R9 and a Zener diode ZD3 are incorporated in the inside of a DC-CDI main switch 25, and a voltage Vz produced by an on-operation of the switch 25 is used commonly as a power supply to control means 26 of the AC-CDI unit 3-5.<br>
Since, in order to prevent starting of the engine by an abnormal operation, the non-linear circuit is provided in the DC-CDI main switch of the AC-CDI type<br>
ignition apparatus such that the non-liner circuit is operated by an on-operation of the DC-GDI main switch to generate a predetermined constant dc voltage which is used commonly as a power supply to the control means of the AC-CDI unit, the engine can be prevented from being started by an abnormal operation and the AC-CDI unit can be formed in a reduced size.<br>
It is to be noted that the embodiment described above is one embodiment of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
Since the AC-CDI type ignition system according to the present invention can start a vehicle engine by an on-operation of a DC-CDI main switch because, using the DC-CDI main switch, a dc voltage of a battery is supplied to an AC-CDI unit by an on-operation of the DC-CDI switch and the AC-CDI unit includes ignition control means which puts the AC-CDI unit into an enabled state by the dc voltage of the battery, an AC-CDI type ignition system which is small in<br>

Furthermore, since the AC-CDI type ignition system according to the present invention includes, in the DC-CDI main switch, a non-linear circuit, which is rendered operative by an on-operation of the DC-CDI main switch to generate a predetermined signal and includes, in the AC-CDI unit, detection means for the signal generated by the non¬linear circuit and puts the AC-CDI unit into an enabled state only when the predetermined signal is detected by the detection means, an AC-CDI type ignition system which is small in size, high in reliability in prevention of robbery and economical can be provided.<br>
