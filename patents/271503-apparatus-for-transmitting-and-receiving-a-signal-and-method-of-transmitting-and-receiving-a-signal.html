[8]	Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for transmitting and<br>
receiving a signal and an apparatus for transmitting and receiving a signal that sub-<br>
stantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
[9]	To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>

[11] <br>
[12]	where, A denotes the valid portion of the first pilot signal, B denotes the cyclic<br>
prefix, C denotes the cyclic suffix, and fSH denotes a frequency shift unit.<br>
[13]	The first portion may be a foremost portion of the useful portion of the first pilot<br>
signal and the second portion may be a backmost portion of the useful portion of the<br>
first pilot signal.<br>

portion of the useful portion of the first pilot signal, into the first pilot signal and a<br>
transmitter (160a) configured to transmit the signal frame including the first pilot<br>
signal over at least one radio frequency (RF) channel.<br>
[17]	In another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for receiving a signal is<br>

deinterleaved bits of the service stream using error-correction-decoding scheme.<br>
[18]	In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided. The method<br>

including a pilot signal in a beginning part of the signal frame, modulating (S160) the<br>
signal frame, inserting (S170) a cyclic prefix obtained by modifying a first portion of<br>

stream from the parsed signal frame.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[20]	According to the apparatus for transmitting and receiving the signal and the method<br>
for transmitting and receiving the signal of the invention, if the data symbol con-<br>
figuring the PLP and the symbols configuring the preamble axe modulated in the same<br>
EFT mode, the probability that the data symbol is detected bythe preamble is low and<br>
the probability that the preamble is erroneously detected is reduced. If continuous<br>
wave (C\V) interference is included like the analog TV signal, the probability that the<br>
preamble is erroneously detected by a noise DC component generated at the time of<br>
correlation is reduced.<br>
[21]	According to the apparatus for transmitting and receiving the signal and the method<br>
for transmitting and receiving the signal of the invention, if the size of the FFT applied<br>
to the data symbol configuring the PLP is larger than that of the FFT applied to the<br>
preamble, the preamble detecting performance may be improved even in a delay<br>
spread channel having a length equal to or greater than that of the usefulsymbol portion<br>
A of the preamble. Since both the cyclic prefix (B) and the cyclic suffix (C) are used in<br>
the preamble, the fractional carrier frequency offset can be estimated.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[79]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
[80]	In the following description, the term "servicers indicative of either broadcast<br>
contents which can be transmitted/received by the signal transmission/reception<br>
apparatus, or content provision.<br>
[81]	Prior to the description of an apparatus for transmitting and receiving a signal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, a signal frame which is<br>
transmitted and received by the apparatus for transmitting and receiving the signal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
[82]	FIG. 1 shows a signal frame for transmitting a service according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[83]	The signal frame shown in FIG. 1 shows an exemplary signal frame for transmitting<br>
a broadcast service including audio/video (A/V) streams. In this case, a single service<br>
is multiplexed in time- and frequency- channels, and the multiplexed service is<br>
transmitted. The above-mentioned signal transmission scheme is called a time-<br>
frequency slicing (TFS) scheme. Compared with the case in which a single service is<br>
transmitted to only one radio frequency (RF) band, the signal transmission apparatus<br>
according to an embodiment of he present invention transmits the signal service via at<br>
least one RF band (possibly several RF bands), such that it can acquire a statistical<br>
multiplexing gain capable of transmitting many more services. The signal<br>
transmission/reception apparatus transmits/receives a single service over several RF<br>
channels, such that it can acquire a frequency diversity gain.<br>
[84]	First to third services (Services 1~3) are transmitted to four RF bands (RF1 ~ RF4).<br>
However, this number of RF bands and this number of services have been disclosed for<br>
only illustrative purposes, such that other numbers may also be used as necessary. Two<br>
reference signals (i.e., a first pilot signal (P1) and a second pilot signal (P2)) are<br>
located at the beginning part of the signal frame. For example, in the case of the RF1<br>
band, the first pilot signal (P1) and the second pilot signal (P2) are located at the<br>
beginning part of the signal frame. The RF1 band includes three slots associated with<br>
the Service 1, two slots associated with the Service 2, and a single slot associated with<br>
the Service 3. Slots associated with other services may also be located in other slots<br>
(Slots 4-17) located after the single slot associated with the Service 3.<br><br>
[85]	The RF2 band includes a first pilot signal (P1), a second pilot signal (P2), and other<br>
slots 13 ~ 17. In addition, the RF2 band includes three slots associated with the Service<br>
1, two slots associated with the Service 2, and a single slot associated with the Service<br>
3.<br>
[S6]	The Services 1 - 3 are multiplexed, and are then transmitted to the RF3 and RF4<br>
bands according to the time-frequency slicing (TFS) scheme. The modulation scheme<br>
for signal transmission may be based on an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme.<br>
[S7]	In the signal frame, individual services are shifted to the RF bands (in the case that<br>
there isa plurality of the RF bands in the signal frame) and a time axis.<br>
[8S]	If signal frames equal to the above signal frame are successively arranged in time, a<br>
super-frame can be composed of several signal frames. A future extension frame may<br>
also be located among the several signal frames. If the future extension frame is<br>
located among the several signal frames, the super-frame may be terminated at the<br>
future extension frame.<br>
[S9]	FIG. 2 shows a first pilot signal (P1) contained in the signal frame of FIG. 1<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[90]	The first pilot signal P1 and the second pilot signal P2 are located at the beginning<br>
part of the signal frame. The first pilot signal P1 is modulated by a 2K FFT mode, and<br>
may be transmitted simultaneously while including a 1/4 guard interval. In FIG. 2, a<br>
band of 7.61Mhz of the first pilot signal PI includes a band of 6.82992Mhz. The first<br>
pilot signal uses 256 carriersfrom among 1705 active carriers. A single active carrier is<br>
used for every' 6 carriers on average. Data-carrier intervals may be irregularly arranged<br>
in the order of 3, 6, and 9. In FIG. 2, a solid line indicates the location of a used carrier,<br>
a thin dotted line indicates the location of an unused carrier, and a chain line indicates<br>
a center location of the unused carrier. In the first pilot signal, the used carrier can be<br>
symbol-mapped by a binary phase shift keying (BPSK), and a pseudo-random bit<br>
sequence (PRBS) can be modulated. The size of a FFT used for the second pilot signal<br>
can be indicated by several PRBSs.<br>
[91]	The signal reception apparatus detects a structure of a pilot signal, and recognizes a<br>
time-frequency slicing (TFS) using the detected structure. The signal reception<br>
apparatus acquires the FFT size of the second pilot signal, compensates for a coarse<br>
frequency offset of a reception signal, and acquires time synchronization.<br>
[92]	In the first pilot signal, a signal transmission type and a transmission parameter may<br>
be set.<br>
[93]	The second pilot signal P2 may be transmitted with a FFT size and a guard interval<br>
equal to those of the data symbol. In the second pilot signal, a single carrier is used as.a<br>
pilot carrier at intervals of three carriers. The signal reception apparatus compensates<br><br>
for a fine frequency synchronization offset using the second pilot signal, and performs<br>
fine time synchronization. The second pilot signal transmits information of a first layer<br>
(L1) from among Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) layers. For example, the second<br>
pilot signal may include a physical parameter and frame construction information. The<br>
second pilot signal transmits a parameter value by which a receiver can access a<br>
Physical Layer Pipe (PLP) service stream.<br>
[94]	L1 (Layer 1) information contained in the second pilot signal P2 is as follows.<br>
[95]	The Layer-1 (L1) information includes a length indicator indicating the length of data<br>
including the LI information, such that it can easily use the signaling channels of<br>
Layers 1 and 2 (L1 and L2) The Layer-1 (L1) information includes a frequency<br>
indicator, a guard-interval length, a maximum number of FEC (Forward Error<br>
Correction) blocks for each frame in association with individual physical channels, and<br>
the number of actual FEC blocks to be contained in the FEC block buffer associated<br>
with a current/previous frame in each physical channel. In this case, the frequency<br>
indicator indicates frequency information corresponding to the RF channel.<br>
[96]	The Layer-1 (L1) information may include a variety of information in association<br>
with individual slots. For example, the Layer-1 (L1) information includes the number<br>
of frames associated with a service, a start address of a slot having the accuracy of an<br>
OFDM carrier contained in an OFDM symbol, a length of the slot, slots corresponding<br>
to the OFDM carrier, the number of bits padded in the last OFDM carrier, service<br>
modulation information, service mode rate information, and Multi-Input-Multi-Output<br>
(MIMO) scheme information.<br>
[97]	The Layer-1 (L1) information may include a cell ID, a flag for service like noti-<br>
fication message service(e.g., an emergency message), the number of current frames,<br>
and the number of additional bits for future use. In this case, the cell ID indicates a<br>
broadcast area transmitted by a broadcast transmitter<br>
[9SJ	The second pilot signal P2 is adapted to perform channel estimation for decoding a<br>
symbol contained in the P2 signal. The second pilot signal P2 can be used as an initial<br>
value for channel estimation for the next data symbol. The second pilot signal P2 may<br>
also transmit Layer-2 (L2) information. For example, the second pilot signal is able to<br>
describe information associated with the transmission service in Layer-2 (L2) in-<br>
formation. The signal transmission apparatus decodes the second pilot signal, such that<br>
it can acquire service information contained in the time-frequency slicing (TFS) frame<br>
and can effectively perform the channel scanning. Meanwhile, this Layer-2 (L2) in-<br>
formation may be included in a specific PLP of the TFS frame. According to another<br>
instance, L2 information can be included in a specific PLP, and the service description<br>
information also can be transmitted in the specific PLP.<br>
[99]	For example, the second pilot signal may include two OFDM symbols of the 8k FFT<br><br>
mode. Generally, the second pilot signal may be any one of a single OFDM symbol of<br>
the 32K FFT mode, a single OFDM symbol of the 16k FFT mode, two OFDM<br>
symbols of the Sk FFT mode, four OFDM symbols of the 4k FFT mode, and eight<br>
OFDM symbols of the 2k FFT mode.<br>
[100] In other words, a single OFDM symbol having the size of a large FFT or several<br>
OFDM symbols, each of which has the size of a small FFT, may be contained in the<br>
second pilot signal P2, such that capacity capable of being transmitted to the pilot can<br>
be maintained.<br>
[101] If information to be transmitted to the second pilot signal exceeds capacity of the<br>
OFDM symbol of the second pilot signal, OFDM symbols after the second pilot signal<br>
can be further used. L1 (Layer1) and L2 (Layer2) information contained in the second<br>
pilot signal is error-correction-coded and is then interleaved, such that data recovery is<br>
carried out although an impulse noise occurs.<br>
[102] As described the above, L2 information can also be included in a specific PLP<br>
conveying the service description information.<br>
[103] FIG. 3 shows a signaling window according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The time-frequency slicing (TFS) frame shows an offset concept of the<br>
signaling information. Layer-1 (L1) information contained in the second pilot signal<br>
includes frame construction information and physical layer information required by the<br>
signal reception apparatus decoding the data symbol. Therefore, if information of the<br>
following data symbols located after the second pilot signal, is contained in the second<br>
pilot signal, and the resultant second pilot signal is transmitted, the signal reception<br>
apparatus may be unable to immediately decode the above following data symbols due<br>
to a decoding time of the second pilot signal.<br>
[104] Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3. the L1 information contained in the second pilot<br>
signal (P2) includes information of a single time-frequency slicing (TFS) frame size,<br>
and includes information contained in the signaling window at a location spaced apart<br>
from the second pilot signal by the signaling window offset.<br>
[105] In the meantime, in order to perform channel estimation of a data symbol con-<br>
structing the service, the data symbol may include a scatter pilot and a continual pilot.<br>
[106] The signal transmission/reception system capable of transmitting/receiving signal<br>
frames shown in FIGS. 1-3 will hereinafter be described. Individual services can be<br>
transmitted and received over several RF channels. A path for transmitting each of the<br>
services or a stream transmitted via this path is called a PLP. The PLP may be dis-<br>
tributed among the timely-divided slots in several RF channels or a single RF band.<br>
This signal frame can convey the timely-divided PLP in at least one RF channel. In<br>
other word, a single PLP can be transferred through at least one RF channel with<br>
timely-divided regions. Hereinafter the signal transmission/reception systems<br><br>
transmitting/receiving a signal frame via at least one RF band will be disclosed.<br>
[107] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for transmitting a signal according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the signal<br>
transmission apparatus includes an input processor 110. a coding and modulation unit<br>
120, a frame builder 130. a MIMO/MISO encoder 140, a plurality of modulators<br>
(150a,..., 150r) of the MIMO/MISO encoder 140, and a plurality of analog processors<br>
(160a,...,160r).<br>
[108]	The input processor 110 receives streams equipped with several services, generates P<br>
number of baseband frames (P is a natural number) which includes modulation- and<br>
coding- information corresponding to transmission paths of the individual services, and<br>
outputs the P number of baseband frames.<br>
[109] The coding and modulation unit 120 receives baseband frames from the input.<br>
processor 110. performs the channel coding and interleaving on each of the baseband<br>
frames, and outputs the channel coding and interleaving result.<br>
[110] The frame builder 130 forms frames which transmit baseband frames contained in P<br>
number of PLPs to R number of RF channels (where R is a natural number), splits the<br>
formed frames, and outputs the split frames to paths corresponding to the R number of<br>
RF channels. Several services may be multiplexed in a single RF channel in time. The<br>
signal frames generated from the frame builder 140 may include a time-frequency<br>
slicing (TFS) structure in which the service is multiplexed in time- and frequency-<br>
domains.<br>
[111] The MIMO/MISO encoder 140 encodes signals to be transmitted to the R number of<br>
RF channels, and outputs the coded signals to paths corresponding to A number of<br>
antennas (where A is a natural number). The MIMO/MISO encoder 140 outputs the<br>
coded signal in which a single to be transmitted to a single RF channel is encoded to<br>
the A number of antennas, such that a signal is transmitted/received to/from a MEMO<br>
(Multi-Input-Multi-Output) or MISO (Multi-Input-Single-Output) structure.<br>
[112] The modulators (150a...., 150r) modulate frequency-domain signals entered via the<br>
path corresponding to each RF channel into time-domain signals. The modulators<br>
(150a, ..., 150r) modulate the input signals according to an orthogonai frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and outputs the modulated signals.<br>
[113] The analog processors (160a, ..., 160r) convert the input signals into RF signals, such<br>
that the RF signals can be outputted to the RF channels.<br>
[114] The signal transmission apparatus according to this embodiment may include a pre-<br>
determined number of modulators (150a,...150r) corresponding to the number of RF<br>
channels and a predetermined number of analog processors (160a,...,160r) corre-<br>
sponding to the number of RF channels. However, in the case of using the MIMO<br>
scheme, the number of analog processors must be equal to the product of R (i.e., the<br><br>
number of RF channels) and A (i.e., the number of antennas).<br>
[115]	FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an input processor 110 according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the input processor 110<br>
includes the first stream multiplexer 111a, the first service splitter 113a, and a plurality<br>
of first baseband (BB) frame builders (115a	 115m). The input processor 310<br>
includes a second stream multiplexer 111b, a second service splitter 113b, and a<br>
plurality of second baseband (BB) frame builders (115n, ..., 115p).<br>
[116]	For example, the first stream multiplexer 111a receives several MPEG-2 transport<br>
streams (TSs), multiplexes the received MPEG-2 TS streams, and outputs the mul-<br>
tiplexed MPEG-2 TS streams. The first service splitter 113a receives the multiplexed<br>
streams, splits the input streams of individual services, and outputs the split streams. As<br>
described above, provided that the service transmitted via a physical-channel path is<br>
called a PLP. the first service splitter 113a splits the service to be transmitted to each<br>
PLP. and outputs the split service.<br>
[117] The first BB frame builders (115a	115m) build data contained in a service to be<br>
transmitted to each PLP in the form of a specific frame, and output the specific-<br>
frame-formatted data. The first BB frame builders (115a, ..., 115m) build a frame<br>
including a header and payload equipped with service data. The header of each frame<br>
may include mode information based on the modulation and encoding of the service<br>
data, and a counter value based on a clock rate of the modulator to synchronize input<br>
streams.<br>
[118] The second stream multiplexer 111b receives several streams, multiplexes input<br>
streams, and outputs the multiplexed streams. For example, the second stream mul-<br>
tiplexer 111b may multiplex Internet Protocol (IP) streams instead of the MPEG-2 TS<br>
streams. These streams may be encapsulated by a generic stream encapsulation (GSE)<br>
scheme. The streams multiplexed by the second stream multiplexer 111b may be any<br>
one of streams, Therefore, the above-mentioned streams different from the MPEG-2<br>
TS streams are called generic streams (GS streams).<br>
[119] The second service splitter 113b receives the multiplexed generic streams, splits the<br>
received generic streams according to individual services (i.e., PLP types), and outputs<br>
the split GS streams.<br>
[120] The second BB frame builders (115n,..., 115p) build service data to be transmitted to<br>
individual PLPs in the form of a specific frame used as a signal processing unit, and<br>
output the resultant service data. The frame format built by the second BB frame<br>
builders (115n, .,, 115p) may be equal to that of the first BB frame builders (115a, ...,<br>
115m) as necessary. If required, another embodiment may also be proposed. In another<br>
embodiment, the frame format built by the second BB frame builders (115n, ...., 115p)<br>
may be different from that of the first BB frame builders (115a,.... 115m). The MPEG-<br><br>
2 TS header further includes a Packe: Syncword which is not contained in the GS<br>
stream, resulting in the occurrence of different headers.<br>
[121] FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a coding and modulation unit according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The coding and modulation unit includes a first<br>
interleaver 123, a second encoder 125, and a second interleaver 127.<br>
[122]	The first encoder 121 acts as an outer coder of the input baseband frame, and is able<br>
to perform the error correction encoding. The first encoder 121 performs the error<br>
correction encoding of the input baseband frame using a Bose- Chaudhuri-Hoc-<br>
quenghem (BCH) scheme. The first interleaver 123 performs interleaving of the<br>
encoded data, such that it prevents a burst error from being generated in a transmission<br>
signal. The first interleaver 123 may not be contained in the above-mentioned em-<br>
bodiment.<br>
[123]	The second encoder 125 acts as an inner coder of either the output data of the first<br>
encoder 121 or the output data of the first interleaver 123, and is able to perform the<br>
error correction encoding. A low density parity bit (LDPC) scheme may be used as an<br>
error correction encoding scheme. The second interleaver 127 mixes the error-<br>
correction-encoded data generated from the second encoder 125. and outputs the mixed<br>
data. The first interleaver 123 and the second interleaver 127 are able ro perform in-<br>
terleaving of data in units of a bit.<br>
[124] The coding and modulation unit 120 relates to a single PLP stream. The PLP stream<br>
is error-correction-encoded and modulated by the coding and modulation unit 120, and<br>
is then transmitted to the frame builder 130.<br>
[125] FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a frame builder according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, the frame builder 130 receives streams of<br>
several paths from the coding and modulation unit 120, and arranges the received<br>
streams in a single signal frame. For example, the frame builder may include a first<br>
mapper 131a and a first time interleaver 132a in a first path, and may include a second<br>
mapper 131b and a second time interleaver 132b in a second path. The number of input<br>
paths is equal to the number of PUPs for service transmission or the number of streams<br>
transmitted via each PLP.<br>
[126] The first mapper l?la performs mapping of data contained in the input stream<br>
according to the first symbol mapping scheme. For example, the first mapper 131a<br>
may perform mapping of the input data using a QAM scheme (e.g., 16 QAM, 64<br>
QAM, and 256 QAM).<br>
[127] If the first mapper 131a performs mapping of the symbol, the input data may be<br>
mapped to several kinds of symbols according to several symbol mapping schemes.<br>
For example, the first mapper 131a classifies the input data into a baseband-frame unit<br>
and a baseband-frame sub-unit. Individual classified data may be hybrid-<br><br>
symbol-mapped by at least two QAM schemes (e.g., 16 QAM and 64 QAM).<br>
Therefore, data contained in a single service may be mapped to symbols based on<br>
different symbol mapping schemes in individual intervals.<br>
[128]	The first time interleaver 132a receives a symbol sequence mapped by the first<br>
mapper 131a, and is able to perform the interleaving in a time domain. The first<br>
mapper 131a maps data, which is contained in the error-corrected frame unit received<br>
from the coding and modulation unit 120, into symbols. The first time interleaver 132a<br>
receives the symbol sequence mapped by the first mapper 131a, and interleaves the<br>
received symbol sequence in units of the error-corrected frame.<br>
[129]	In this way, the p-th mapper 131p or the p-th time interleaver 132p receives service<br>
data to be transmitted to the p-th PLP. maps the service data into symbols according to<br>
the p-th symbol mapping scheme. The mapped symbols can be interleaved in a time<br>
domain. It should be noted that this symbol mapping scheme and this interleaving<br>
scheme are equal to those of the first time interleaver 132a and the first mapper 131a.<br>
[130]	The symbol mapping scheme of the first mapper 131a may be equal to or different<br>
from that of the p-th mapper 131p. The first mapper 131a and the p-th mapper 131p are<br>
able to map input data to individual symbols using the same or different hybrid symbol<br>
mapping schemes.<br>
[131] Data of the time interleavers located at individual paths (i.e., service data interleaved<br>
by the first time interleaver 132a and service data to be transmitted to R number of RF<br>
channels by the p-th time interleaver 132p) is interleaved, such that the physical<br>
channel allows the above data to be interleaved over several RF channels.<br>
[132]	In association with streams received in as many paths as the number of PLPs, the<br>
TFS frame builder 133 builds the TFS signal frame such as the above-mentioned signal<br>
frame, such that the service is time-shifted according to RF channels. The TFS frame<br>
builder 133 splits service data received in any one of paths, and outputs the service<br>
data split into data of the R number of RF bands according to a signal scheduling<br>
scheme.<br>
[133]	The TFS frame builder 133 receives the first pilot signal and the second pilot signal<br>
from the signaling information unit (denoted by Ref/PL signal) 135, arranges the first<br>
and second pilot signals in the signal frame, and inserts the signaling signal (LI and<br>
L2) of the above-mentioned physical layer in the second pilot signal. In this case, the<br>
first and second pilot signals are used as the beginning signals of the signal frame<br>
contained in each RF channel from among the TFS signal frame received from the<br>
signaling information unit (Ref/PL signal) 135. As shown in FIG. 2, the first pilot<br>
signal may include a transmission type and basic transmission parameters, and the<br>
second pilot signal may include a physical parameter and frame construction in-<br>
formation. Also, the second pilot signal includes a L1 (Layer 1) signaling signal and a<br><br>
L2 (Layer 2) signaling signal.<br>
[134] The R number of frequency interleavers (137a, ..., 137r) interleave service data, to be<br>
transmitted to corresponding RF channels of the TFS signal frame, in a frequency<br>
domain. The frequency interleavers (137a	137r) can interleave the service data at a<br>
level of data cells contained in an OFDM symbol.<br>
[135] Therefore, service data to be transmitted to each RF channel in the TFS signal frame<br>
is frequency-selective-fading-processed, such that it may not be lost in a specific<br>
frequency domain.<br>
[136] FIG. 8 is a view showing a first example of a ratio of symbols when the mappers<br>
131a and 131b perform hybrid symbol mapping. This Figure shows the number of bits<br>
transmitted by one sub carrier (cell) if error correction coding is performed by the<br>
coding and modulation unit in a normal mode (the length of the error-correcdon-coded<br>
code is 64800 bits) of LDPC error correction coding mode.<br>
[137] For example, if the mappers 131a and 131b perform symbol mapping using<br>
256QAM, 64S00 bits are mapped to S100 symbols. If the mappers 131a and 131b<br>
perform hybrid symbol mapping (Hyb 128-QAM) using 256QAM and 64QAMwith a<br>
ratio of 3:2, the number of symbols mapped by 256QAM is 4S60 and the number of<br>
symbols mapped by 64QAM is 4320. The number of transmitted bits per sub carrier<br>
(cell) is 7.0588.<br>
[138] If a symbol mapping method of 64QAM is used, input data may be mapped to 10800<br>
symbols and six bits per cell may be transmitted. If data is mapped to the symbols by a<br>
hybrid symbol mapping method of 64QAM and 16QAM (64QAM:16QAM=3:2,<br>
Hyb32-QAM), five bits may be transmitted by one sub carrier (cell).<br>
[139] If data is mapped to symbols by the 16QAM method, the data is mapped to 16200<br>
symbols, each of which is used to transmit four bits.<br>
[140] Similarly, if data is mapped to symbols by a hybrid symbol mapping method of<br>
16QAM and QPSK (16QAM:QPSK=2:3, HybS-QAM). three bits may be transmitted<br>
by one sub carrier (cell).<br>
[141]	If data is mapped to symbols by a QPSK method, the data may be mapped to 32400<br>
symbols, each of which is used to transmit two bits.<br>
[142] FIG. 9 shows symbol mapping methods of error-corrected data by LDPC error<br>
correction coding method of a short mode (the length of the error-correction-coded<br>
code is 16200 bits), which are equal to the symbol mapping methods of FIG. 8, and the<br>
numbers of bits per sub carrier according to the symbol mapping methods.<br>
[143] The numbers of bits transmitted by the sub carrier is equal to those of the normal<br>
mode (64S00 bits) according to the symbol mapping methods such as 256QAM, Hyb<br>
12S-QAM, 64-QAM, Hyb 32-QAM, 16QAM, HybS-QAM and QPSK, but the total<br>
numbers of symbols transmitted are different from those of the normal mode. For<br><br>
example, 16200 bits are transmitted by 2025 symbols in 256QAM, 16200 bits are<br>
transmitted by 1215 symbols according to 256QAM and 10S0 symbols according to<br>
64QAM (total 2295 symbols) in Hyb 128-QAM.<br>
[144] Accordingly, a data transmission rate per sub carrier (cell) for each PLP may be<br>
adjusted according to a hybrid symbol mapping method or a single symbol mapping<br>
method.<br>
[145]<br>
[146] FIG. 10 is a view showing the number of symbols and bit number per cell word<br>
according to a symbol mapping method in an LDPC normal mode. If a TFS signal<br>
frame includes at least one RF channel, symbols configuring a specific PLP can be<br>
uniformly allocated to RF channels. The locations of the PLP symbols allocated to the<br>
RF channels can be more efficiently addressed. Accordingly, when the signal receiving<br>
apparatus selects the RF channels, the bits used for addressing the specific PLP can be<br>
reduced.<br>
[147] In this drawing, a symbol mapping method represented by 256-QAM indicates a<br>
method of mapping bits configuring a single error-correction-coded block to symbols<br>
with a ratio of 256QAM:64QAM=S:1. According to this symbol mapping method, the<br>
number of the bits in a single error-correction-coded block by the 256-QAM method is<br>
57600, the number of the bits in a single error-correction- coded block by the<br>
256-QAM method is 1200, the number of total symbols in the block is S400, and the<br>
bit number per cell word is 7.714285714.<br>
[14S] A symbol mapping method represented by Hyb 128-QAM indicates a method of<br>
mapping bits configuring a single error-correction-coded block-to symbols with a ratio<br>
of 256QAM:64QAM=8:7. According to the Hyb 128-QAM symbol mapping method,<br>
the number of total symbols in a single error-correction-encoding block is 9600, and<br>
the bit number per cell word is 6.75.<br>
[149] According to a symbol mapping method represented by 64 QAM, the number of total<br>
symbols in a single error-correction-encoding block is 10800 and the bit number per<br>
cell word is 6.<br>
[150] A symbol mapping method represented by Hyb 32-QAM indicates a method of<br>
mapping bits configuring a single error-correction- coded block to symbols with a ratio<br>
of 64QAM:32QAM=5:4. According to the Hyb 32-QAM symbol mapping method, the<br>
number of total symbols in the error-correction-coded block is 13200, and the bit<br>
number per cell word is 4.9090909.<br>
[151] A symbol mapping method represented by 16 QAM indicates a methodof mapping<br>
bits configuring a single error-correction- coded block to symbols with a ratio of<br>
16QAM:QPSK=1:8. According to the 16 QAM symbol mapping method, the number<br>
of total symbols in one error-correction-coded block is 15600. and the bit number per<br><br>
cell word is 4.153S46154.<br>
[152] A symbol mapping method represented by Hyb S-QAM indicates a method of<br>
mapping bits configuring a single error-correction- coded block to symbols with a ratio<br>
of 16QAM:QPSK=2:1. According to the Hyb S-QAM symbol mapping method, the<br>
number of total symbols in one error-correction-coded block is 21600, and the bit<br>
number per cell word is 3.<br>
[153] According to a symbol mapping method represented by QPSK, the number of total<br>
symbols in one error-correction-coded block is 32400 and the bit number per cell word<br>
is 2.<br>
[154] When the symbols configuring the PLP are allocated to the RF channels, the<br>
diversity gain of the frequency domain can be maximized whenthe numbers of the<br>
symbols allocated to the respective RF channels are equal. If a maximum of six RF<br>
channels is considered, the lowest common multiple of 1 to 6 is 60 and the greatest<br>
common divisor of the numbers of symbols mapped to one error correction codedblock<br>
is 1200. Accordingly, if the integral multiple of 1200/60=20 symbols is allocated to<br>
each of the RF channels, the symbols can be uniformly allocated to all the RF<br>
channels. At this time, if 20 symbols are considered as one group and the group is<br>
addressed, the addressing overhead of log2(20)4.32 bits can be reduced compared with<br>
the case the symbols are addressed one by one.<br>
[155]<br>
[156] FIG. 11 is a view showing another example of the number of symbols according to a<br>
symbol mapping method in an LDPC normal mode. In the example of this drawing, a<br>
256-QAM method using 256QAM and 64QAM symbols (256QAM:64QAM=4:1), a<br>
Hyb 12S-QAM method using 256QAM and 64QAM symbol (256QAM:64QAM=8:7),<br>
a 64QAM method, a Hyb 32-QAM method using 64QAM and 8QAM symbols<br>
(64QAM:SQAM=3:2), a 16 QAM method using 16QAM and QPSK symbols<br>
(16QAM:QPSK=1:14) a Hyb 8-QAM method using 16QAM:QPSK=2:1 and a QPSK<br>
method were used as the symbol mapping method. The greatest common divisor<br>
(GCD) of the numbers of total symbols of an error correction coded block (normal<br>
mode) according to the symbol mapping methods is 720. Accordingly, if the integral<br>
multiple of 12(=720/60) symbols is allocated to each of the RF channels, the symbols<br>
can be uniformly allocated to all the RF channels. At this time, if 12 symbols are<br>
considered as one group and the group is addressed, the addressing overhead of<br>
log2(12)3.58 bits can be reduced compared with the case the symbols are addressed<br>
one by one. The signal receiving apparatus can collect the allocated PLP symbols by<br>
the addressing scheme and obtain a PLP service stream.<br>
[157]<br>
[158] FIG. 12 is a view showing another example of the number of symbols according to a<br><br>
symbol mapping method in an LDPC normal mode. In the example of this drawing, a<br>
256-QAM scheme, a Hyb 128-QAM scheme, a 64QAM scheme, a Hyb 32-QAM<br>
scheme, a 16 QAM scheme, a Hyb S-QAM scheme and a QPSK scheme were used as<br>
the symbol mapping method. The 256QAM symbol mapping method uses 256QAM<br>
and 64QAM symbols (256QAM:64QAM=44:1) and the Hyb 12S-QAM symbol<br>
mapping method uses 256QAM and 64QAM symbols (256QAM:64QAM=28:17). The<br>
Hyb 32-QAM method uses 64QAM and 8QAM symbols (64QAM:SQAM=3:2), the-<br>
16QAM symbol mapping method uses 16QAM and QPSK symbols (16QAM:<br>
QPSK=1.T4), and the Hyb S-QAM symbol mapping method uses 16QAM and QPSK<br>
symbols (16QAM:QPSK=2:1). The GCD of the numbers of total symbols of an error<br>
correction coded block (normal mode) according to the symbol mapping methods is<br>
240. Accordingly, if the integral multiple of 240/60=4 symbols is allocated to each of<br>
the RF channels, the symbols can be uniformly allocated to all the RF channels. At this<br>
time, if four symbols are considered as one group and the group is addressed, the ad-<br>
dressing overhead of log2(4)2 bits can be reduced compared with the case where the<br>
symbols are addressed one by one. Accordingly, even when the number of RF<br>
channels is any one of 1 to 6 in the signal frame, the PLP symbols can be uniformly<br>
allocated to the RF channels.<br>
[159]<br>
[160] FIG. 13 is a view showing the number of symbols according to a symbol mapping<br>
method in an LDPC short mode. As described above, if symbol mapping is performed<br>
according to this example, the PLP symbols can be uniformly allocated to the RF<br>
channels and the overhead of the PLP symbol addressing can be reduced. The symbol<br>
mapping methods shown in this drawing are equal to those shown in FIG. 10.<br>
However, since the bit number of the LDPC short mode is different from that of the<br>
normal mode, the GCD of the numbers of total symbols of an error correction coded<br>
block (short mode) according to the symbol mapping methods is 300, unlike to FIG.<br>
10. Accordingly, if the integral multiple of 300/60=5 symbols is allocated to each of<br>
the RF channels, the symbols can be uniformly allocated to all the RF channels. At this<br>
time, if five symbols are considered as one group and the group is addressed, the ad-<br>
dressing overhead of log2(5) bits can be reduced compared with the case where the<br>
symbols are addressed one by one. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the addressing<br>
bits are saved by iog2(5) bits when the divided PLP symbols are addressed.<br>
[161]<br>
[162]	FIG. 14 is a view showing an example of the number of symbols according to a<br>
symbol mapping method in an LDPC short mode. The symbol mapping methods of<br>
this drawing are equal to those shown in FIG. 11. In this example, the GCD of the<br>
numbers of total symbols of an error correction coded block (short mode) according to<br><br>
the symbol mapping methods is 180, which may be used for PLP symbol allocation of<br>
one RF channel and the addressing of the allocated symbols. In this embodiment, the<br>
addressing bits are saved by log2(3) bits.<br>
[163]<br>
[164] FIG. 15 is a view showing another example of the number of symbols according to a<br>
symbol mapping method in an LDPC short mode. The symbol mapping methods of<br>
this drawing are equal to those shown in FIG. 12. In this example, the GCD of the<br>
numbers of total symbols of an error correction coded block (short mode) according to<br>
the symbol mapping methods is 60. In this embodiment, the addressing bits are saved<br>
by log2(l) bits (that is, the addressing bit is not saved).<br>
[165]<br>
[166] FIG. 16 is a view showing an example of each of the symbol mappers 131a and 131b<br>
shown in FIG. 7. Each of the symbol mappers 13 la and 131b includes a first order<br>
mapper 1315a, a second order mapper 131b, a symbol merger 1317 and an error<br>
correction block merger 1318.<br>
[167] The bit stream parser 1311 receives the PLP service stream from the coding and<br>
modulation unit and splits the received service stream.<br>
[168] The First order symbol mapper 1315a maps the bits of the service stream split by a<br>
 higher order symbol mapping method to symbols. The second order symbol mapper<br>
1315b maps the bits of the service stream split by a lower order symbol mapping<br>
method to symbols. For example, in the above example, the first order symbol mapper<br>
1315a may map the bit stream to symbols according to 256QAM and the second order<br>
symbol mapper 1315b may map the bit stream to symbols according to 64QAM.<br>
[169] The symbol merger 1317 merges the symbols output from the symbol mappers 1315a<br>
and 1315b to one symbol stream and outputs the symbol stream. The symbol merger<br>
1317 may output the symbol stream included in one PLP.<br>
[170] The error correction block merger 1318 may output one symbol stream merged by<br>
the symbol merger 1317 in the error-correction-coded code block unit. The error<br>
correction block merger 1318 may output a symbol block such that the error-<br>
correction-coded code blocks are uniformly allocated to at least one RF band of the<br>
TFS signal frame. The error correction block merger 1318 may output the symbol<br>
block such that the length of the symbol block of the error-correction-coded block of a<br>
normal mode is equal to that of the symbol block of the error-correction-coded block<br>
of a short mode. For example, four symbol blocks of the error-correction-coded block<br>
of the short mode may be merged to one symbol block.<br>
[171] The error correction block merger 1318 may split the symbol stream according to a<br>
common multiple of the number of RF bands such that signal frame builder uniformly<br>
arranges the symbols to the RF bands. If the maximum number of RF bands in the<br><br>
signal frame is 6, the error correction block merger 1318 outputs the symbol block<br>
such that the total number of symbols can be divided by 60 which is a common<br>
multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.<br>
[172] The symbols included in the output symbol block may be arranged to be uniformly<br>
allocated to the six RF bands. Accordingly, although an error correction mode<br>
according to a code rate and a symbol mapping method are combined, the symbols<br>
configuring the PLP are uniformly allocated to the RF bands.<br>
[173]<br>
[174] FIG. 17 is a view showing another embodiment of each of the symbol mappers 131a<br>
and 131b. The embodiment of this drawing is similar to the embodiment of FIG. 16<br>
except that a first order power calibration unit 1316a and a second order power cal-<br>
ibration unit 1316b are further included.<br>
[175] The first order power calibration unit 1316a calibrates the power of the symbols<br>
mapped by the first order symbol mapper 1315a according to the size of the con-<br>
stellation and outputs the calibrated symbols. The second order power calibration unit<br>
1316b calibrates the power of the symbols mapped by the second order symbol mapper<br>
1315b according to the size of the constellation and outputs the calibrated symbols.<br>
Accordingly, although the symbol mapping methodis changed in one PLP or is<br>
changed among a plurality of PLPs, if the power of the symbol by the symbol mapping<br>
method is adjusted according to the size of the constellation, signal reception per-<br>
formance of a receiver can be improved,<br>
[176] The symbol merger 1317 merges the symbols calibrated by the power calibration<br>
units 1316a and 1316b and outputs one symbol stream.<br>
[177]<br>
[17S] FIG. 18 is a view showing another embodiment of the symbol mapper. In the em-<br>
bodiment of this Figure, the symbol mapper includes the second encoder 125 and the<br>
second interleaver 127 included in the coding and modulation unit. That is, if this em-<br>
bodiment is used, the coding and modulation unit may include only the first encoder<br>
121, the first interleaver 123 and the second encoder 125.<br>
[179] The embodiment of the symbol mapper includes a bit stream parser 1311, a first<br>
order bit interleaver 1312a, a second order bit interleaver 1312b, a first order demux<br>
1313a, a second order demux 1313b, a first order symbol mapper 1315a, a second<br>
order symbol mapper 1315b and a symbol merger 1317.<br>
[180] When the second encoder 125 performs LDPC error correction coding, the length of<br>
the error-correction-coded block (e.g., the length of 64800 bits and the length of 16200<br>
hits) may vary according to an LDPC mode. If the bits included in the error-<br>
correction-coded block are mapped to the symbols, the error correction capabilities of<br>
the bits included in a cell word configuring the symbol may vary according to the<br><br>
locations of the bits. For example, the cell word which is the symbol may be de-<br>
termined according to the code rate of the error correction coding and the symbol<br>
mapping method (whether the symbol mapping method is the higher order symbol<br>
mapping method or the lower order symbol mapping method). If the error-<br>
correction-code is the LDPC, the error correction capabilities of the bits vary according<br>
to the locations of the bits in the error-correction-coded block. For example, the relia-<br>
bilities of the bits coded according to the characteristics of the H-matrix used in the<br>
irregular LDPC error correction coding method may vary according to the locations of<br>
the bits. Accordingly, the order of the bits configuring the cell word mapped to the<br>
symbol is changed such that the error correction capabilities of the bits which are weak<br>
against the error correction in the error-correction-coded block are adjusted and the ro-<br>
bustness against the error in the bit level can be adjusted.<br>
[181] First, the second encoder 125, for example, performs the error correction coding with<br>
respect to the stream included in one PLP by the LDPC error correction coding<br>
method.<br>
[182]	The bit stream parser 1311 receives the service stream according to the PLP and<br>
splits the received service stream.<br>
[183]	The first order bit interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits included in a first bit stream<br>
of the split service streams. Similarly, the second order bit interleaver 1312b in-<br>
terleaves the bits included in a second bit stream of the split service streams.<br>
[184]	The first order bit interleaver 1312a and the second order bit interleaver 1312b may<br>
correspond to the second interleaver 127 used as an inner interleaver. The interleaving<br>
method of the first order bit interleaver 1312a and the second order bit interleaver<br>
1312b will be described later.<br>
[185] The first order demux 1313a and the second order demux 1313b demultiplex the bits<br>
of the bit streams interleaved by the first order bit interleaver 1312a and the second<br>
order bit interleaver 1312b. The demuxs 1313a and 1313b divide the input bit stream<br>
into sub bit streams which will be mapped to a real axis and an imaginary axis of a<br>
constellation and output the sub bit streams. The symbol mappers 1315a and 1315b<br>
map the sub bit streams demultiplexed by the demuxs 1313a and 1313b to the corre-<br>
sponding symbols.<br>
[186] The bit Lnterleavers 1312a and 1312b and the demuxs 1313a and 1313b may combine<br>
the characteristics of the LDPC codeword and the characteristics of the constellation<br>
reliability of the symbol mapping according to the constellation. The detailed em-<br>
bodiment of the first order demuxs 1313a and 1313b will be described later.<br>
[187] The first order symbol mapper 1315a performs first order symbol mapping, for<br>
example, higher order symbol mapping, and the second order symbol mapper 1315b<br>
performs second order symbol mapping, for example, lower order symbol mapping.<br><br>
The first order symbol mapper 1315a maps the sub bit streams output from the first<br>
order demux 1313 to the symbols and the second order symbol mapper 1315b maps<br>
the sub bit streams output from the second order demux' 1313b to the symbols.<br>
[188] The symbol merger 1317 merges the symbols mapped by the first order symbol<br>
mapper 1315a and the second order symbol mapper 1315b to one symbol stream and<br>
outputs the symbol stream.<br>
[189] As described above, in the LDPC, the error correction capabilities of the bits may be<br>
changed according to the locations of the bits in the error-correction-coded block. Ac-<br>
cordingly, if the bit interleaver and the demux are controlled according to the charac-<br>
teristics of the LDPC encoder 125 so as to change the order of the bits configuring the<br>
cell word, the error correction capability in the bit level can be maximized.<br>
[190]<br>
[191]	FIG. 19 is a view showing another embodiment of each of the symbol mappers 131a<br>
and 131b. The embodiment of this drawing is similar to the embodiment of FIG. 18<br>
except that a first order power calibration unit 1316a and a second order power cal-<br>
ibration unit 1316b are further included.<br>
[192] The first order power calibration unit 1316a calibrates the power of the symbols<br>
mapped by the first order symbol mapper 1315a according to the size of the con-<br>
stellation and outputs the calibrated symbols. The second order power calibration unit<br>
1316b calibrates the power of the symbols mapped by the second order symbol mapper<br>
1315b according tothe size of the constellation and outputs the calibrated symbols. Ac-<br>
cordingly, although the symbol mapping scheme is changed in one PLP or is changed<br>
among a plurality of PLPs, if the power of the symbol is adjusted according to the size<br>
of the constellation, signal reception performance can be improved.<br>
[193] The symbol merger 1317 merges the symbols calibrated by the power calibration<br>
units 1316a and 1316b and outputs one symbol scream.<br>
[194]	FIG. 20 is a view showing the concept of interleaving of bits by the bit interleavers<br>
1312a and 1312b of FIGs. 18 and 19.<br>
[195] For example, input bits are stored in and read from a matrix-formed memory having<br>
a predetermined number of rows and columns. When the input bits are stored, first, the<br>
bits are stored in a first column in row direction, and, if the first column is filled up, the<br>
bits are stored in another column in row direction. When the stored bits are read, the<br>
bits are read in column direction and, if all the bits stored in a first row are read, the<br>
bits in another row are read in column direction. In other word, when the bits are<br>
stored, the bits are stored row-wise such that the columns are filled up serially. And<br>
when the stored bits are read, the stored bits are read column-wise from the first row to<br>
last row serially. In this Figure, MSB means a most significant bit and LSB means a<br>
least significant bit.<br><br>
[196] In order to map the LDPC-error-correction-coded bits to the symbols in the same<br>
length of error correction block unit at various code rates, the bit interleaves 1312a<br>
and 1312b may change the number of rows and columns of the memory according to<br>
the types of the symbol mappers 1315a and 1315b.<br>
[197] Fig. 21 is a view showing an example of the number of rows nd columns of<br>
memories of the bit interleaves 1312a and 1312b according to the types of symbol<br>
mappers 1315a and 1315b. if the LDPC mode is the normal mode.<br>
[19S] For example, if the symbol mapper 1315a maps the bits to 256QAM symbols, the<br>
first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits by a memory having S100 rows and S<br>
columns. If the symbols are mapped by 64QAM. the first order interleaver 1312a in-<br>
terleaves the bits by a memory having 10S00 rows and 6 columns. If the s&gt;-mbols are<br>
mapped by 16QAM, the first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits by a memory<br>
having 16200 rows and 4 columns.<br>
[199] For example, if the symbol mappers 1315a and 13-15b map the bits to Hyb128-QAM<br>
symbols, the first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits using a memory having<br>
4860 rows and S columns, and the second order interleaver 1312b interleaves the bits<br>
using a memory having 4320 rows and 6 columns.<br>
[200] Similarly, if the symbol mappers 1315a and 1315b map the symbols by<br>
Hyb-32-QAM, the first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits using a memory-<br>
having 64S0 rows and 6 columns, and the second order interleaver 1312b interleaves<br>
the bits using a memory having 64S0 rows and 4 columns.<br>
[201]	Fig. 22 is a view showing an example of the number of rows and columns of the<br>
memories of the bit interleaves 1312a and 1312b according to the types of the symbol<br>
mappers 1315a and 1315b. if the LDPC mode is the short mode.<br>
[202] For example, if the symbol mapper 1315a maps the bits to 256QAM symbols, the<br>
first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits by a memory having 2025 rows and S<br>
columns. If the symbol mappers 1315a and 1315b map the symbols by Hybl2S-QAM.<br>
the first order interleaver 1312a interleaves the bits using a memory' having 1215 rows<br>
and S columns, and the second order interleaver 1312b interleaves the bits using a<br>
memory' having 10S0 rows and 6 columns.<br>
[203] If the bit interleaving is performed with respect to the error-correction-coded block,<br>
the locations of the bits in the error-correction-coded block may be changed.<br>
[204]<br>
[205] FIG. 23 is a diagram showing the concept of another embodiment of interleaving of<br>
abit interleaver. In the embodiment shown in this drawing, when bits are written in a<br>
memory, the bits are written in a column direction. When the written bits axe read, the<br>
bits of the circularly shifted locations are read in a row direction. In each row. the bits<br>
written in each row is circularly shifted. If the bits are written or read by a circular shift<br><br>
method with respect to the row or the column of the memory, this is called twisted bit<br>
interleaving. This embodiment relates to the twisted bit interleaving method using a<br>
method of reading the bits after the bits are shifted by one column in row direction.<br>
Instead of shifting the written bits in the memory, the point for re'ading bits in the<br>
memory or the point for writing bits in the memory can be shifted.<br>
[206] In this embodiment, N denotes the length of the error correction coded block and C<br>
denotes the length of the column. When the bits are written, the bits are written in a<br>
first column (represented by a shadow) in order of 1. 2, 3. 4, ..., and C and the bits are<br>
written in a second column in order of C+1, C+2, C+3	<br>
[207]	The written bits are twisted in the row direction one column by one column.<br>
[208]	If the written bits are read, the twisted bits are read in the row direction. For example,<br>
in this embodiment, the bits are read in a first row in order of 1, C+1,... and the bits are<br>
read in a second row in order of X1. 2, C+2. ...(X1 is a bit in the first column of the<br>
second row). The bits are read by row by row and the circularly shifted bits are read.<br>
Of course, instead of shifting the written bits in the memory, the point for reading bits<br>
written in the memory can be shifted.<br>
[209]<br>
[210] FIG. 24 is a view showing another embodiment of bit interleaving. In this em-<br>
bodiment, N denotes the length of the error correction coded block and C denotes the<br>
length of the column. When the bits are written, the bits are written in a first column in<br>
order of 1. 2, 3, 4, ..., C-1, and C and the bits are written in a second column in order of<br>
C+1,C+2, C+3, ...<br>
[211]	The written bits are double-twisted in the row direction two columns by two<br>
columns. If the written bits are read, the bits circularly shifted by two columns are read<br>
in the column direction in every row. This method may be called a double twisted bit<br>
interleaving method.<br>
[212]<br>
[213]	FIG. 25 is a view showing another embodiment of bit interleaving. In this em-<br>
bodiment, N denotes the length of the error correction coded block and C denotes the<br>
length of the column. The bits are written in a first column in order of 1, 2. 3. 4,..., C-<br>
1. and C and ths bits are written in a second column in order of C+1, C+2, C+3, ... .<br>
[214]	When the written bits are read, in a first region of the rows, the bits may be read by<br>
the twisted bit interleaving method.<br>
[215]	In a second region of the rows, the bits may be read-by the double twisted in-<br>
terleaving method.<br>
[216]	In a third region of the rows, the bits may be read by the twisted bit interleaving<br>
method.<br>
[217]	If the bits are interleaved by at least one of the twisted bit interleaving method and<br><br>
the double twisted interleaving method, the hits in the error correction coded block can<br>
be more randomly mixed.<br>
[218]<br>
[219]	FIG. 26 is a view showing the concept of multiplexing of input bits of the demuxs<br>
1313a and 1313b.<br>
[220]	The bit interleavers 1312a and 1312b interleave the input bits x0, x1..... and xn-1<br>
and output the interleaved bits. The interleaving method is already described above.<br>
[221]	The demuxs 1313a and 1313b demultiplex the interleaved bit streams. The demul-<br>
tiplexing method may vary according to the code rate of the error correction coding<br>
method and the symbol mapping method of the symbol mapper. If the symbol method <br>
of the symbol mapper is QPSK, the input bits, for example, are interleaved to two sub<br>
streams and the symbol mapper maps the two sub streams to the symbols so as to<br>
correspond to the real axis and the imaginary axis of the constellation. For example, a<br>
first bit yO of the demultiplexed first sub stream corresponds to the real axis and a first<br>
bit yl of the demultiplexed second sub stream corresponds to the imaginary axis.<br>
[222]	If the symbol method of the symbol mapper is 16QAM, the input bits, for example,<br>
are demultiplexed to four sub frames. The symbol mapper selects the bits included in<br>
the four sub streams and maps the selected bits to the symbols so as to correspond to<br>
the real axis and the imaginary axis of the constellation.<br>
[223] For example, the bits y0 and y2 of the demultiplexed first and third sub streams<br>
correspond to the real axis and the bits yl and y3 of the demultiplexed second and<br>
fourth sub streams correspond to the imaginary axis.<br>
[224]	Similarly, if the symbol method of the symbol mapper is 64QAM, the input bits may<br>
be demultiplexed to six bit streams. The symbol mapper maps the six sub streams to<br>
the symbols so as to correspond to the real axis and the imaginary axis of the con-<br>
stellation. For example, the demultiplexed first, third and fifth sub stream bits y0, y2<br>
and y4 correspond to the real axis and the demultiplexed second, fourth and sixth sub<br>
stream bits y1, y3 and y6 correspond to the imaginary axis.<br>
[225]	Similarly, if the symbol method of the symbol mapper is 256QAM, the input bits<br>
may be demultiplexed to eight bit streams. The symbol mapper maps the eight sub<br>
steams to the symbols so as to correspond to the real axis and the imaginary axis of<br>
the constellation. For example, first, the demultiplexed first, third fifth and seventh sub<br>
stream bits yO, y2, y4 and y6 correspond to the real axis and the demultiplexed second,<br>
fourth, sixth and eighth sub stream bits y1, y3, y6 and y7 correspond to the imaginary<br>
axis.<br>
[226]	If the symbol mapper maps the symbols, the sub streams demultiplexed by the<br>
demux may be mapped to the bit streams of the real axis and the imaginary axis of the<br>
constellation.<br><br>
[227]	The above-described bit interleaving method, demultiplexing method and symbol<br>
mapping method are exemplary and various methods may be used as the method of<br>
selecting the bits in the sub streams such that the sub streams demultiplexed by the<br>
demux may correspond to the real axis and the imaginary axis of the constellation.<br>
[22S]	The cell word mapped to the symbols may vary according to any one of the error-<br>
corrected bit streams according to the code rate, the method of interleaving the bit<br>
streams, the demultiplexing method and the symbol mapping method. The MSB of the<br>
cell word is higher than the LSB of the cell word in the reliability of the error<br>
correction decoding. Although the reliability of the bit of a specific location of the<br>
error-correction-coded block is low, the reliability of the bit can be improved by the<br>
symbol demapping process if the bit of the cell word is arranged on the MSB or close<br>
to the MSB.<br>
[229] Accordingly, although the reliability of the bit coded according to the characteristics<br>
of the H-matrix used in the irregular LDPC error correction coding method is changed,<br>
the bit can be robustly transmitted/received by the symbol mapping and demapping<br>
process and the system performance can be adjusted.<br>
[230]	FIG. 27 is a view showing an embodiment of demultiplexing an input stream by the<br>
demux.<br>
[231] If the symbol mapping method is QPSK, two bits are mapped to one symbol and the<br>
two bits of one symbol unit are demultiplexed in order of the bit indexes (indexes 0<br>
and 1 of b).<br>
[232] If the symbol mapping method is 16QAM, 4 bits are mapped to one symbol and the<br>
four bits of one symbol unit are demultiplexed accordingto the calculating result of the<br>
modulo-4 of bit indexes (indexes 0, 1, 2 and 3 of b).<br>
[233] If the symbol mapping method is 64QAM, 6 bits are mapped to one symbol and the<br>
six bits of one symbol unit are demultiplexed according to the calculating result of the<br>
modulo-6 of bit indexes (indexes 0, 1. 2, 3, 4 and 5 of b).<br>
[234] If the symbol mapping method is 256QAM, 8 bits are mapped to one symbol and the<br>
eight bits of one symbol unit are demultiplexed according to the calculating result of<br>
the modulo-8 of bit indexes (indexes 0, 1, 2, 3,4. 5, 6 and 7 of b).<br>
[235]	The demultiplexing order of the sub streams is exemplary and may be modified.<br>
[236] FIG. 2S is a view showing an example of a demultiplexing type according to a<br>
symbol mapping method. The symbol mapping method includes QPSK, 16QAM,<br>
64QAM and 256QAM and the demultiplexing type includes a first type to a sixth<br>
type.<br>
[237] The first type is an example in which the input bits sequentially correspond to even-<br>
numbered indexes (0. 2. 4, 8, ...) (or the real axis of the constellation) and sequentially<br>
correspond to odd-numbered indexes (1, 3, 5,7,...) (or the imaginary axis of the con-<br><br>
stellation). Hereinafter, the bit demultiplexing of the first type may be represented by a<br>
demultiplexing identifier 10 (a binary number of 1010; the location of 1 is the location'<br>
of the MSB corresponding to the real axis and the imaginary axis of the constellation).<br>
[238] The second type is an example in which the demultiplexing is performed in reverse<br>
order of the first type, that is, the LSB of the input bits sequentially correspond to<br>
even-numbered indexes (6,4, 2, 0) (or the real axis of the constellation) and odd-<br>
numbered indexes (1, 3, 5, 7,...) (or the imaginary axis of the constellation).<br>
Hereinafter, the bit demultiplexing of the second type may be represented by a demul-<br>
tiplexing identifier.5 (a binary number of 0101).<br>
[239] The third type is an example in which the input bits are arranged such that the bits of<br>
the both ends of the codeword become the MSB. The input bits are rearranged so as to<br>
fill the code word from the both ends of the code word. Hereinafter, the bit demul-<br>
tiplexing of the third type may be represented by a demultiplexing identifier 9 (a binary<br>
number of 1001).<br>
[240] The fourth type is an example in which the input bits are arranged.such that a middle<br>
bit of the code word becomes the MSB. A bit of the input bits is first filled in the<br>
middle location of the code word and the remaining bits are then rearranged toward the<br>
both ends of the code word in order of the input bits. Hereinafter, the bit demul-<br>
tiplexing of the fourth type may be represented by a demultiplexing identifier 6 (a<br>
binary number of 0110).<br>
[241] The fifth type is an example in which the bits are demultiplexed such that a last bit of<br>
the code word becomes the MSB and a first bit thereof becomes the LSB, and the sixth<br>
type is an example in which the bits are rearranged such that the first bit of the code<br>
word becomes the MSB and the last bit thereof becomes the LSB. Hereinafter, the bit<br>
demultiplexing of the fifth type may be represented by a demultiplexing identifier 3 (a<br>
binary number of 0011), and the bit demultiplexing of the sixth type may be rep-<br>
resented by a demultiplexing identifier 12 (a binary number of 1100).<br>
[242] As described above, the demultiplexing type may vary according to the symbol<br>
mapping method or the code rate of the error correction coding method. That is, a<br>
different demultiplexing type may be used if the symbol mapping method or the code<br>
rate is changed.<br>
[243] FIG. 29 is a view showing an embodiment of demultiplexing an input bit stream<br>
according to a demultiplexing type. This embodiment may include bit interleavers<br>
1312a and 1312b, demuxs 1313a and 1313b and mappers 1315a and 1315b.<br>
[244] The bit interleavers 1312a and 1312b interleave the error-correction-coded PLP<br>
service streams. For example, the bit interleavers 1312a and 1312b may perform the bit<br>
interleaving in the error correction coding units according to the error .correction<br>
coding mode. The bit interleaving method is already described above.<br><br>
[245] The demuxs 1313a and 1313b may include first type demuxs 1313al and 1313M,...<br>
and nth type demuxs 1313a2 and 1313b2. Here, n is an integer. The methods of demul- <br>
tiplexing the bits by the n types of demuxs follow the types shown in FIG. 17.-For<br>
example, the first type demuxs may correspond to the first type bit demultiplexing .<br>
(1100) and the second type demux (not shown) may correspond to the second type bit<br>
demultiplexing (0011). The nth type demux 1313b demultiplexes the input bit stream<br>
according to the nth type bit multiplexing (e.g., the demultiplexing identifier 1100) and<br>
outputs the demultiplexed bit stream. Selectors 1313a3 and 1313b3 receive a demux<br>
selection signal of the demultiplexing type suitable for the input bits and output the de-<br>
multiplexed bit stream according to any one of the first type to the nthtype and the<br>
demux selection signal. The demux selection signal may vary according to, the code<br>
rate of the error correction coding and the symbol mapping method of the con-<br>
stellation. Accordingly, the demultiplexing typemay be determined according to the<br>
code rate of the error correction coding method or/and the symbol mapping method of.<br>
the constellation. The detailed example according to. the symbols mapped to the con-<br>
stellation or/and the code rate of the error correction coding according to the demux<br>
selection signal will be described later.<br>
[246] . The mappers 1315a and 1315b may map the demultiplexed sub bit streams to the<br>
symbols according to the demux selection signal and output the mapped symbols.<br>
[247] FIG. 30 is a view showing a demultiplexing type which is determined according to a<br>
code rate of the error correction coding and the symbol mapping method.<br>
[248] In the 4QAM symbol mapping method, even when the code rate cr of the LDPC<br>
error correction coding method is any one of 1/4, 1/3, 2/5,1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6,<br>
8/9 and 9/10, the bit stream can be demultiplexed according to all the demultiplexing<br>
types (denoted by all).<br>
[249] In the 16QAM symbol mapping method, if the code rate of the LDPC error .<br>
correction coding method is 1/4, 1/3, 2/5 and 1/2, the symbols can be mapped without<br>
performing the bit interleaving and the bit demultiplexing (denoted by No-Int and No-<br>
Demux). If the code rate of the error correction coding is 3/5, the bit can be demul-.<br>
tiplexed according to any one of the demultiplexing identifiers 9, 10 and 12. If the code<br>
rate of the error correction coding is 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9 and 9/10, the input bit<br>
stream can be demultiplexed according to the demultiplexing identifier 6.<br>
[250] In the 64QAM symbol mapping method, if the code rate of the LDPC error<br>
correction coding is 1/4, 1/3, 2/5 and 1/2, the symbols can be mapped without<br>
performing the bit interleaving and the bit demultiplexing. If the code rate is 3/5, the<br>
bits can be demultiplexed according to any one of the demultiplexing identifiers 9 and<br>
10. If the code rate is 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6', 8/9 and 9/10, the bits can be.demultiplexed.<br>
according to the demultiplexing.identifier 6.<br><br>
[251] In the 256QAM symbol mapping method, if the code rate of the LDPC error'<br>
correction coding isl/4, 1/3, 2/5 and 1/2, the symbols can be mapped without<br>
performing the bit interleaving and the bit demultiplexing. If the code rate is 3/5; the<br>
bits can be demultiplexed according to the demultiplexing identifier 9. If the code rate<br>
is 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9 and 9/10, the bits can be demultiplexed according.to the de-<br>
multiplexing identifier 6.<br>
[252] As described above, the bit demultiplexing type may vary according to the code rate<br>
used for the error correction coding and the symbol mapping method. Accordingly, the •<br>
error correction capability of a bit located on a specific location of the error-<br>
correction-coded block may be adjusted by mapping the demultiplexed sub streams to<br>
the symbols. Accordingly it is possible to optimize the robustness in the bit level.<br>
[253] FIG. 31 is a view showing an example of expressing the demultiplexing method by<br>
an equation. For example, if the symbol mapping method is QPSK, the input bits (xi,<br>
xN/2+i) correspond to the demultiplexed bits y0 and y1. If the symbol mapping<br>
method is 16QAM, the input bits (<br><br>
) correspond to the demultiplexed bits yO, yl, y2 and y3.<br>
[254] If the symbol mapping method is 64QAM, the input bits (<br><br>
) correspond to the demultiplexed bits yO, yl, y2, y3, y4 and y5. If the symbol<br>
mapping method is 256QAM, the input bits (<br><br>
) correspond to the demultiplexed bits yO, yl, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6 and y7.<br>
[255] Here, N denotes the number of bits mapped to the symbols with respect to the input<br>
of the bit interleaver.<br>
[256]<br>
[257] FIG. 32 is a view showing an example of mapping a symbol by a symbol mapper.<br>
For example, in the QPSK symbol mapping method, the symbols on the constellation<br>
correspond to the value of the bit yO of the demultiplexed first sub stream and the value<br>
of the bit yl of the demultiplexed second sub stream.<br>
[258] In the 16QAM, the real axis of the symbols on the constellation corresponds to the<br>
bits of the demultiplexed first and third sub streams (bits separated from the location of<br>
the MSB by 0 and 2) and the imaginary axis thereof corresponds to the bits of the de-<br><br>
multiplexed second and fourth sub streams (bits separated from the location of the<br>
MSB by 1 and 3).<br>
[259] In the 64QAM, the real axis of the symbols on the constellation corresponds to the<br>
bits of the demultiplexedfirst, third, and fifth sub streams (bits separated from the<br>
location of the MSB by 0, 2 and 4) arid the imaginary axis thereof corresponds to the<br>
bits of the demultiplexed second, fourth and sixth sub streams (bits separated from the<br>
location of the MSB by 1, 3 and 5).<br>
[260] Accordingly, the bits configuring the symbol may be mapped to the cell word in the<br>
demultiplexing order. If the bits configuring the cell word are demultiplexed, the MSB<br>
and the LSB of the cell word are changed and the robustness of the bits can be adjusted<br>
although the reliabilities of the LDPC error-correction-coded bits vary according to the<br>
locations.<br>
[261] FIG. 33 is a block diagram illustrating a MIMO/MISO encoder according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. The MIMO/MISO encoder encodes the input data<br>
using the MIMO/MISO encoding scheme, and outputs-the encoded data to several<br>
paths, If a signal reception end receives the signal transmitted to the several paths from<br>
one or more paths, it is able to acquire a gain (also called a diversity gain, a payload<br>
gain, or a multiplexing gain).<br>
[262] The MIMO/MISO encoder 140 encodes service data of each path generated from the<br>
frame builder 130. and outputs the encoded data to the A number of paths corre-<br>
sponding to the number of output antennas.<br>
[263] FIG. 34 is a block diagram illustrating a modulator according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The modulator includes a first power controller (P.APR Reducel)<br>
151, a time-domain transform unit (IFFT) 153, a second power controller (PAPR<br>
Reduce2) 157, and a guard-interval inserter 159.<br>
[264] The first power controller 151 reduces a PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) of<br>
data transmitted to the R number of signal paths in the frequency domain.<br>
[265] The time-domain transform (IFFT) unit 153 converts the received frequency-domain<br>
signals into time-domain signals. For example, the frequency-domain signals may be<br>
converted into the time-domain signals according to the IFFT algorithm. Therefore, the<br>
frequency-domain data may be modulated according to the OFDM scheme.<br>
[266] The second power controller (PAPR Reduce2) 157 reduces a PAPR<br>
(Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) of channel data transmitted to the R number of signal<br>
paths in the time domain. In this case, a tone reservation scheme, and an active con-<br>
stellation extension (ACE) scheme for extending symbol constellation can be used.<br>
[267] The guard-interval inserter 159 inserts the guard interval into the output OFDM<br>
symbol, and outputs the inserted result. As described above, the above-mentioned em-<br>
bodiment can be carried out in each signal of the R number of paths.<br><br>
[268]	FIG. 35 is a block diagram illustrating an analog processor 160 according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. The analog processor 160 includes a digital-.<br>
to-analog converter (DAC) 161, an up-conversion unit 163, and an analog filterT65.<br>
[269] The DAC 161 converts the input data into an analog signal, and outputs the analog<br>
signal. The up-conversion unit 163 converts a frequency domain of the analog signal<br>
into an RF area. The analog filter 165 filters the RF-area signal, and outputs the filtered<br>
RF signal.<br>
[270]	FIG. 36 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for receiving a signal according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. The signal reception apparatus includes a<br>
first signal receiver 210a, an n-th signal receiver 210n. a first demodulator 220a, an n-<br>
th demodulator 220n, a MIM07MISO decoder 230. a frame parser 240, and a decoding<br>
demodulator 250, and an output processor 260.<br>
[271] In the case of a reception signal according to the TFS signal frame structure, several<br>
services are multiplexed to R channels, and are then time-shifted, such that the time-<br>
shifted result is transmitted.<br>
[272] The receiver may include at least one signal receiver for receiving a service<br>
transmitted over at least one RF channel. The TFS signal frame transmitted to the R<br>
(where R is a natural number) number of RF channels can be transmitted to a multi-<br>
path via the A number of antennas. The A antennas have been used for the R RF<br>
channels, such that a total number of antennas is R x A.<br>
[273]	The first signal receiver 210a is able to receive service data transmitted via at least<br>
one path from among overall service data transmitted via several RF channels. For<br>
example, the first signal receiver 210a can receive the transmission signal processed by<br>
the MIMO/MISO scheme via several paths.<br>
[274] The first signal receiver 210a and the n-th signal receiver 21 On can receive several<br>
service data units transmitted over n number of RF channels from among several RF<br>
channels, as a single PLP. Namely, this embodiment shows the signal reception<br>
apparatus capable of simultaneously receiving data of the R number of RF channels.<br>
Therefore, if this embodiment receives a single RF channel, only the first receiver 210a<br>
is needed.<br>
[275] The first demodulator 220a and the n-th demodulator 220n demodulate signals<br>
received in the first and n-th signal receivers 210a and 210n according to the OFDM<br>
scheme, and output the demodulated signals.<br>
[276] The MIMO/MISO decoder 230 decodes service data received via several<br>
transmission paths according to the MIMO/MISO decoding scheme, and outputs the<br>
decoded service data to a single transmission path. If the number R of services<br>
transmitted over several transmission paths are received, the MIMO/MISO decoder<br>
230 can output single PLP service data contained in each of R services corresponding<br><br>
to the number of R channels. If P number of services are transmitted via the R number<br>
of RF channels, and signals of individual RF channels are received via the A number<br>
of antennas, the receiver decodes the P number of services using a total of (R x A)<br>
reception antennas.<br>
[277] The frame parser 240 parses the TFS signal frame including several services, and<br>
outputs the parsed service data.<br>
[278] The decoding demodulator 250 performs the error correction decoding on the service<br>
data contained in the parsed frame, demaps the decoded symbol data into bit data, and<br>
outputs the demapping-processed result.<br>
[279] The output processor 260 decodes a stream including the demapped bit data, and<br>
outputs the decoded stream.<br>
[280] In the above-mentioned description, each of the frame parser 240, and the decoding<br>
demodulator 250, and the output processor 260 receives several service data units as<br>
many as the number of PLPs, and performs signal processing on the received service<br>
data.<br>
[281] FIG. 37 is a block diagram illustrating a signal receiver according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The signal receiver may include a tuner 211, a down-<br>
converter 213, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 215.<br>
[282] The tuner 211 performs hopping of some RF channels capable of transmitting user-<br>
selected services in all RF channels when the PLP is included in several RF channels,<br>
and outputs the hopping result. The tuner 211 performs hopping of RF channels<br>
contained in the TFS signal frame according to input RF center frequencies,and at the<br>
same time tunes corresponding frequency signals, such that it outputs the tuned signals.<br>
If a signal is transmitted to A number of multi-paths, the tuner 211 performs the tuning<br>
to a corresponding RF channel, and receives reception signals via the A number of<br>
antennas.<br>
[283] The down converter 213 performs down conversion of the RF frequency of the signal<br>
tuned by the tuner 211, and outputs the down-conversion result. The ADC 215<br>
converts an analog signal into a digital signal.<br>
[284] FIG. 38 is a block diagram illustrating a demodulator according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The demodulator includes a frame detector 221, a frame syn-<br>
chronization unit 222, a guard-interval remover 223, a frequency-domain transform<br>
unit (FFT) 224, a channel estimator 225, a channel equalizer 226, and a signaling-in- <br>
formation extractor 227.<br>
[285] If the demodulator acquires service data transmitted to a single PLP stream, the<br>
following signal demodulation will be carried out. A detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
[286] The frame detector 221 identifies a delivery system of a reception signal. For<br><br>
example, the frame detector 221 determines whether the reception signal is a DVB-TS<br>
signal or not. And, the.frame detector 221 may also determine whether a reception<br>
signal is a TFS signal frame or not. The frame synchronization unit 222 acquires time-<br>
and frequency- domain synchronization of the TFS signal frame.<br>
[287] The guide interval controller 223 removes a guard interval located between OFDM<br>
symbols from the time domain. The frequency-domain converter (FFT)-224 converts a<br>
reception signai into a frequency-domain signal using the FFT algorithm, such that it<br>
acquires frequency-domain symbol data.<br>
[288] The channel estimator 225 performs channel estimation of a receptionchannel using a<br>
pilot symbol contained in symbol data of the frequency domain. The channel equalizer<br>
226 performs channel equalization of reception data using channel information<br>
estimated by the channel estimator 225.<br>
[289]	The signaling information extractor 227 can extract the signaling information of a<br>
physical layer established in the first and second pilot signals contained in channel-<br>
equalized reception data.<br>
[290] FIG. 39 is a block diagram illustrating a MIMO/MISO decoder according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the. present invention. The signal receiver and the demodulator are<br>
designed to process a signal received in a single path. If the signal receiver and the de-<br>
modulator receive PLP service data providing a single service via several paths of<br>
several antennas, and demodulate the PLP service data, the MIMO/MIMO decoder 230<br>
outputs the signal received in several paths as service data transmitted to a single PLP.<br>
Therefore, the MIMO/MISO decoder 230 can acquire a diversity gain and a mul-<br>
tiplexing gain from service data received in a corresponding PLP.<br>
[291] The MIMO/MISO decoder 230 receives a multi-path transmission signal from<br>
several antennas, and is able to decode a signal using a MIMO scheme capable of re-<br>
covering each reception signal in the form of a single signal. Otherwise, the MIMO/<br>
MISO decoder 230 is able to recover a signal using a MIMO scheme which receives<br>
the multi-path transmission signal from a single antenna and recovers the received<br>
multi-path transmission signal.<br>
[292] Therefore, if the signal is transmitted via the R number of RF channels (where R is a<br>
natural number), the MIMO/MISO decoder 230 can decode signals received via the A<br>
number of antennas of individual RF channels. If the A value is equal to "1", the<br>
signals can be decoded by the MISO scheme. If the A value is higher than "1", the<br>
signals can be decoded by the MEMO scheme.<br>
[293] FIG. 40 is a block diagram illustrating a frame parser according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The frame parser includes a first frequency de-interleaver 241a,<br>
a r-th frequency de-interleaver 241r, a frame parser 243, a first time de-interleaver<br>
245a, a p-th time de-interleaver 245p, a first symbol demapper 247a, and a p-th symbol<br><br>
demapper. The value of V'can be decided by the number of RF channels, and the<br>
value of "p"can be decided by the'number of streams transmitting PLP service data<br>
generated from the frame parser 243.<br>
[294] Therefore, if p number of services are transmitted to p number of PLP streams over R<br>
number of RF channels, the frame parser includes the r number of frequency de-<br>
interleavers, the p number of time de-interleavers, and the p number of symbol<br>
demappers.<br>
[295] In association with a first RF channel, the first frequency interleaver 241a performs<br>
de-interleaving of frequency-domain input data, and outputs the de-interleaving result.<br>
[296] The frame parser 243 parses the TFS signal frame transmitted to several RF channels<br>
using scheduling information of the TFS signal frame, and parses PLP service data<br>
contained in the slot of a specific RF channel including a desired service. The frame<br>
parser 243 parses the TFS signal frame to receive specific service data distributed to<br>
several RF channels according to the TFS signal frame structure, and outputs first-path<br>
PLP service data.<br>
[297] The first time de-interleaver 245a performs de-interleaving of the parsed first-path<br>
PLP service data in the time domain. The first symbol demapper 247a determines<br>
service data mapped to the symbol to be bit data, such that it can output a PLP stream<br>
associated with the first-path PLP service data.<br>
[298] Provided that symbol data is converted into bit data, and each symbol data includes<br>
symbols based on the hybrid symbol-mapping scheme, the p number of symbol<br>
demappers, each of which includes the first symbol demapper, can determine the<br>
symbol data to be bit data using different symbol-demapping schemes in individual<br>
intervals of the input symbol data.<br>
[299] FIG. 41 is a view showing an embodiment of each of symbol demappers 247a and<br>
247p. The symbol demappers receive the streams corresponding to the PLPs from the<br>
time interleaves 245a and 245p respectively corresponding to the symbol demappers.<br>
[300] Each of the symbol demappers 247a and 247p may include an error correction block-<br>
splitter 2471, a symbol splitter 2473, a first order demapper 2475a, a second order<br>
demapper 2475b and a bit stream merger 2478.<br>
[301] The error correction block splitter 2471 may split the PLP stream received from the<br>
corresponding one of the time interleaves 245a and 245p in the error correction block<br>
units. The error correction block splitter 2471 may split the service stream in the<br>
normal mode LDPC block unit. In this case, the service stream may be split in a state<br>
in which four blocks according to the short mode (the block having the length of 16200<br>
bits) are treated as the error correction block of one block according to the normal<br>
mode (the block having the length of 64800 bits).<br>
[302] The symbol splitter 2473 may split the symbol stream in the split error correction<br><br>
block according to the symbol mapping method of the symbol stream.<br>
[303]	For example, the first order demapper 2475a converts the symbols according to the<br>
higher order symbol mapping method into the bits. The second order demapper 2475b<br>
converts the symbols according to the lower order symbol mapping method into the<br>
bits.<br>
[304]	The bit stream merger 2478 may receive the converted bits and output one bit stream.<br>
[305]<br>
[306]	FIG. 42 is a view showing anodier embodiment of each of the symbol demappers<br>
247a and 247p. The embodiment of dais drawing is similar to the embodiment of FIG.<br>
41 except that a first order power calibration unit 2474a and a second order power cal-<br>
ibration unit 2474b are further included.<br>
[307]	The first order power calibration unit 2474a receives the symbols split by the symbol<br>
splitter 2473, calibrates the power of the received symbols according to the symbol<br>
mapping schemes, and outputs the calibrated symbols. The power of the received<br>
symbols may have the power calibrated according to the size of the constellation based<br>
on the symbol mapping mediods. The first order power calibration unit 2474a converts<br>
the power calibrated in accordance with the into the original symbol power of the con-<br>
stellation. The first order demapper 2475a may demap the symbols, of which the<br>
power is calibrated by the first order power calibration unit, to the bits.<br>
[308]	Similarly, the second order power calibration unit 2474b receives the symbols split<br>
by the symbol splitter 2473, modified the calibrated power of the received symbols to<br>
the original power according to the size of the constellation, and outputs the modified<br>
symbols.<br>

[310] FIG. 43 is a view showing another embodiment of each of the symbol demappers<br>
247a and 247p. Each of the symbol demappers 247a and 247p may include a symbol<br>
splitter 2473, a first order demapper 2474a, a second order demapper 2474b, a first<br>
order mux 2475a, a second order mux 2475b, a first order bit deinterleaver 2476a, a<br>
second order bit deinterleaver 2476b and a bit stream merger 2478. By this em-<br>
bodiment, the embodiment of the decoding and demodulation unit of FIG. 33 includes<br>
a first decoder 253, a first deinterleaver 255 and a second decoder 257.<br>
[311] The symbol splitter 2473 may split the symbol stream of the PLP according to the<br>
method corresponding to the symbol mapping method.<br>
[312] The first order demapper 2474a and the second order demapper 2474b convert the<br>
split symbol streams into bits. For example, the first order demapper 2474a performs<br>
the symbol demapping of the higher order QAM and the second order demapper 2474b<br>
performs the symbol demapping of the lower order QAM. For example, the first order<br>
demapper 2474a may perform the symbol demapping of 256QAM and the second<br><br>
order demapper 2474b may perform the symbol demapping of 64QAM.<br>
[313] The first order mux 2475a and the second order mux 2475b multiplex the symbol-<br>
mapped bits. The multiplexing methods may correspond to the demultiplexing<br>
methods described with reference to FIGs. 15 to 18. Accordingly, the demultiplexed<br>
sub streams may be convened into one bit stream.<br>
[314] The first order bit deinterleaver 2476a deinterleaves the bit streams multiplexed by<br>
the first order mux 2475a. The second order bit deinterleaver 2476b deinterleaves the<br>
bits multiplexed by the first order mux 2475a. The deinterleaving method corresponds<br>
to.the bit interleaving method. The bit interleaving method is shown in FIG. 12.<br>
[315] The bit stream merger 2478 may merge the bit streams deinterleaved by the bit in-<br>
terleavers 2476a and 2476b to one bit stream.<br>
[316] The first decoder 253 of the decoding and demodulation unit may error correction<br>
decode the output bit stream according to the normal mode or the short mode and the<br>
code rate according to the modes.<br>
[317] FIG. 44 is a view showing another embodiment of each of the symbol demappers<br>
247a and 247p. The embodiment of this drawing is similar to the embodiment of FIG.<br>
43 except that a first order power calibration unit 2474a and a second order power cal-<br>
ibration unit 2474b are further included. The first order power calibration unit 2474a<br>
and the second order power calibration unit 2474b modify the calibrated powers of the<br>
symbols according to the symbol mapping methods and output the modified symbols<br>
to the symbol demappers 2475a and 2475b.<br>
[318] FIG. 45 is a view showing an embodiment of multiplexing the demultiplexed sub<br>
stream. In this embodiment, the demappers 2474a and 2474b decide the cell words<br>
including the bits. The muxs 2475a and 2475b multiplex the decided cell words<br>
according to the mux selection signal. The demultiplexed cell words are input to any<br>
one of first muxs 2475a2 and 2475b2 to nth muxs 2475a3 and 2475b3.<br>
[319] The first muxs 2475a2 and 2475b2 to the nth muxs 2475a3 and 2475b3 change the<br>
order of the bits in the cell words input according to the mux selection signal. The mux<br>
selection signal may be changed according to the code rate of the error correction<br>
coding or the symbol mapping memod. In order to generate one stream and the bit<br>
streams delivered to the muxs, the order of selecting the sub stream may be changed<br>
according to the mux selection signal.<br>
[320] The first demuxs 2475al and 2475b 1 output the symbol-demapped bit streams to any<br>
one of the first muxs 2475a2 and 2475b2 to the nth muxs 2475a3 and 2475b3<br>
according to the mux selection signal. The first sub muxs 2475al and 2475b 1 may<br>
receive the sub streams multiplexed by the first muxs 2475a2 and 2475b2 to the nth<br>
muxs 2475a3 and 2475b3 and output one stream, according to the mux selection<br>
signal.<br><br>
[321] The cell words including the changed bits are input to the bit interleavers 2476a and<br>
2476b, and the bit deinterleavers 2476a and 2476b deinterleave the input bits and<br>
butputthe deinterleaved bits.<br>
[322] FIG. 46 is a block diagram illustrating a decoding demodulator according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. The decoding demodulator may include several<br>
function blocks corresponding to the coding and modulation unit. In this embodiment,<br>
the decoding demodulator of FIG. 16 may include a first de-interleaver 251, a first<br>
decoder 253, a second de-interleaver 255, and a second decoder 257. The second de-<br>
interleaver .255 can be selectively contained in the decoding demodulator.<br>
[323] The first de-interleaver 251 acts as an inner de-interleaver, and is able to.perform de-<br>
interleaving of the p-th PLP stream generated from the frame parser.<br>
[324] The first decoder 253 acts as an inner decoder, can perform error correction of the<br>
de-interleaved data, and can use an error correction decoding algorithm based on the<br>
LDPC scheme.<br>
[325] The second de-interleaver 255 acts as an outer interleaver, and can perform de-<br>
interleaving of the error- correction-decoded data.<br>
[326] The second decoder 257 acts as an outer decoder. Data de-interleaved by the second<br>
de-interleaver 255 or error-corrected by the first decoder 253 is error-corrected again,<br>
such that the second decoder 257 outputs the re- error-corrected data. The second<br>
decoder 257 decodes data using the error correction decoding algorithm based on the<br>
BCH scheme, such that it outputs the decoded data.<br>
[327] The first de-interleaver 251 and the second de-interleaver 255 are able to convert the<br>
burst error generated in data contained in the PLP stream into a random error. The first<br>
decoder 253 and the second decoder 257 can correct errors contained in data. -<br>
[328] The decoding demodulator shows operation processes associated with a single PLP<br>
stream. If the p number of streams exist, the p number of decoding demodulators are<br>
needed, or the decoding demodulator may repeatedly decode input data p times.<br>
[329] FIG. 47 is a block diagram illustrating an output processor according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. The output processor may include p number of<br>
baseband (BB) frame parsers (251a,.... 261p). a first service merger 263a, a second<br>
service merger 263b, a first demultiplexer 265a, and a second demultiplexer 265b.<br>
[330] The BB frame parsers (261a, ..., 261p) remove BB frame headers from the first to p-<br>
th PLP streams according to the received PLP paths, and output the removed result.<br>
This embodiment shows that service data is transmitted to at least two streams. A first<br>
stream is an MPEG-2 TS stream, and a second stream is a GS stream.<br>
[331] The fust service merger 263a calculates the sum of service data contained in pay load<br>
of at least one BB frame, such that it outputs the sum of service data as a single service<br>
stream. The first demultiplexer 255a may. demultiplex the service stream, and output<br><br>
the demultiplexed result.<br>
[332] In this way, the second service merger 263b calculates the sum of service data<br>
contained in payload of at least one BB frame, such that it can output another service<br>
stream. The second demultiplexer 255b may demultiplex the GS-format service<br>
stream, and output the demultiplexed service stream.<br>
[333] FIG. 48 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for transmitting a signal<br>
according to an embodiment of another embodiment of an embodiment of by the<br>
present invention. The signal transmission apparatus includes a service composer 310,<br>
a frequency splitter 320, and a transmitter 400. The transmitter 400 encodes or<br>
modulates a signal including a service stream to be transmitted to each RF band.<br>
[334] The service composer 310 receives several service streams, multiplexes several<br>
service streams to be transmitted to individual RF channels, and outputs the mul-<br>
tiplexed service streams. The service composer 310 outputs scheduling information,<br>
such that it controls the transmitter 400 using the scheduling information, when the<br>
transmitter 400 transmits the PLP via several RF channels. By this scheduling in-<br>
formation, the service composer 310 modulates several service frames to be<br>
transmitted to the several RF channels by the transmitter 400. and transmits the<br>
modulated service frames.<br>
[335] The frequency splitter 320 receives a service stream to be transmitted to each RF<br>
band, and splits each service stream into several sub-streams, such that the individual<br>
RF frequency bands can be allocated to the sub-streams.<br>
[336] The transmitter 400 processes the service streams to be transmitted to individual<br>
frequency bands, and outputs the processed resultant streams. For example, in as-<br>
sociation with a specific service stream to be transmitted to the first RF channel, the<br>
first mapper 410 maps the input service stream data into symbols. The first interleaver<br>
420 interleaves the mapped symbols to prevent the burst error.<br>
[337] The first symbol inserter 430 can insert a signal frame equipped with a pilot signal<br>
(e.g., a scatter pilot signal or a continual pilot signal) into the modulated signal.<br>
[338] The first modulator 440 modulates the data interleaved by the signal modulation<br>
scheme. For example, the first modulator 440 can modulate signals using the OFDM<br>
scheme.<br>
[339] The first pilot symbol inserter 450 inserts the first pilot signal and the second pilot<br>
signal in the signal frame, and is able to transmit the TFS signal frame.<br>
[340]	Service stream data transmitted to the second RF channel is transmitted to the TFS<br>
signal frame via several blocks 415, 425, 435. 445. and 455 of different paths shown in<br>
the transmitter of FIG. 18.<br>
[341] The number of signal processing paths transmitted from the transmitter 400 may be<br>
equal to the number of RF channels contained in the TFS signal frame.<br><br>
[342]	The first mapper 410 and the second mapper may respectively include the demul-<br>
tiplexers 1313a and 1313b, and allow the locations of the MSB and the LSB to be<br>
changed in the symbol-mapped cell word.<br>
[343]	FIG. 49 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for receiving a signal according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention. The signal reception apparatus may<br>
include a reception unit 510, a synchronization unit 520. a mode detector 530, an<br>
equalizer 540, a parameter detector 550. a de-interleaver 560, a demapper 570, and a<br>
service, decoder 580.<br>
[344] The reception unit500 is able to receive signals of a first RF channel selected by a<br>
user from among the signal frame. If the signal frame includes several RF channels, the<br>
reception unit 500 performs hopping of the several RF channels, and at the same time<br>
can receive a signal including the selected service frame.<br>
[345] The synchronization unit 510 acquires synchronization of a reception signal, and<br>
outputs the synchronized reception signal. The demodulator 520 is able to demodulate<br>
the synchronization-acquired signal. The mode detector 530 can acquire a FFT mode<br>
(e.g., 2k, 4k, 8k FFT operation length) of the second pilot signal using the first pilot<br>
signal of the signal frame.<br>
[346]	The demodulator 520 demodulates the reception signal under the FFT mode of the<br>
second pilot signal. The equalizer 540 performs channel estimation of the reception<br>
signal, and outputs the channel-estimation resultant signal. The de-interleaver 560 de-<br>
interleaves the channel-equalized reception signal. The demapper 570 demaps the in-<br>
terleaved symbol using the symbol demapping scheme corresponding to the<br>
transmission-signal symbol mapping scheme (e.g., QAM).<br>
[347] The parameter detector 550 acquires physical parameter information (e.g., Layer-1<br>
(L1) information) contained in the second pilot signal from the output signal of the<br>
equalizer 540, and transmits the acquired physical parameter information to the<br>
reception unit 500 and the synchronization unit 510. The reception unit 500 is able to<br>
change the RF channel to another channel using network information detected by the<br>
parameter detector 550.<br>
[348] The parameter detector 550 outputs service-associated information, service decider<br>
580 decodes service data of the reception signal according to the service-associated in-<br>
formation from the parameter detector 550, and outputs the decoded service data.<br>
[349] The demapper 570 may include the muxs 2475a and 2475b and output the bit stream<br>
obtained by restoring the order of the bits of which the locations of the MSB and the<br>
LSB are changed according to the code rate of the error correction coding and the<br>
symbol mapping method.<br>
[350] Hereinafter, a method formodulating a first pilot signal of a signal frame having at<br>
least one RF band and a method and apparatus for receiving the modulated first pilot<br><br>
signal will be described.<br>
[351]	The time-interleaved PLP symbols are transmitted via regions, which are temporally<br>
divided in the signal frame. The time-interleaved PLP symbols may be transmitted via<br>
regions, which are divided in the frequency domain, if a plurality of RF bands exists.<br>
Accordingly, if the PLP is transmitted or received, a diversity gain can be obtained. An<br>
error correction mode and a symbol mapping method may be changed according to<br>
services corresponding to transport streams or may be changed in the service.<br>
[352]	A first pilot signal and a second pilot signal are arranged at the start location of the<br>
signal frame having such characteristics, as a preamble signal.<br>
[353]	As described above, the first pilot signal included in the signal frame may include an<br>
identifier for identifying the signal frame having the above-described structure. The<br>
first pilot signal may include information about the transmission structure indicating<br>
whether or not the signal frame is transmitted via multiple paths and information about<br>
an FFT mode of a signal following the first pilot signal. The receiver can detect the<br>
signal frame from the first pilot signal and obtain the information about the integral<br>
carrier frequency offset estimation and information about the FFT mode of the data<br>
symbol.<br>
[354]<br>
[355]	FIG. 50 is a view showing an embodiment of the structure of a first pilot signal. A<br>
portion denoted by A is a useful portion of the first pilot signal. B denotes the same<br>
cyclic prefix as a first portion of the portion A in the time domain and C denotes the<br>
same cyclic suffix as a second portion of the portion A in the time region. The first<br>
portion may be duplicated from the second half of the portion A and the second portion<br>
may be duplicated from the first half of the portion A.<br>
[356] B and C can be respectively obtained by duplicating the first portion and the second<br>
portion and frequency shifting the duplicated portions. A relationship between B or C<br>
and A is as follows.<br>
[357]	[Equation 1]<br>
[35S] <br>
[359] In the above equation, SH denotes a shift unit of the frequency shift. Accordingly,<br>
the frequency shift values of the portions B and C may be inversely proportional to the<br>
lengths of the portions B and C.<br>
[360] If the first pilot signal is configured by frequency shifting the cyclic.prefix (B) and<br>
the cyclic suffix (C), the probability that the data symbol is erroneously detected to the<br><br>
preamble is low and the probability that the preamble is erroneously detected is<br>
reduced, although the data symbols configuring the PLP and the symbols configuring<br>
the preamble are modulated in the same FFT mode.<br>
[361] If continuous wave (C\V) interference is included like an analog TV signal, the<br>
probability that the preamble is erroneously detected due to a noise DC component<br>
generated in a correlation process, is reduced. In addition, if the size of the FFT applied<br>
to the data symbols configuring the PLP is larger than that of the FFT applied to the<br>
preamble, preamble detection performance can be improved even in a delay spread<br>
channel having a length equal to or greater than that of the useful symbol portion A of<br>
the preamble. Since both the cyclic prefix (B) and the cyclic suffix (C) are used in the<br>
preamble, the fractional carrier frequency offset can be estimated by the correlation<br>
process.<br>
[362] FIG. 51 is a view showing an embodiment of detecting a preamble signal shown in<br>
FIG. 50 and estimating a timing offset and a frequency offset. This embodiment may<br>
be included in the frame detector 221 or the frame synchronization unit 222.<br>
[363] This embodiment may include a first delay unit 601, a complex conjugate calculation<br>
unit 603, a first multiplier 605, a second multiplier 607, a first filter 611, a second<br>
delay unit 615, a third multiplier 609, a second filter 613, a fourth multiplier 617, a<br>
peak search unit 619, and a phase measurement unit 621.<br>
[364] The first delay unit 601 may delay a received signal. For example, the first delay unit<br>
601 may delay the received signal by the length of the useful symbol portion (A) of the<br>
first pilot signal.<br>
[365] The complex conjugate calculation unit 603 may calculate the complex conjugate of<br>
the delayed first pilot signal and output the calculated signal.<br>
[366] The first multiplier 605 may multiply the signal output from the complex conjugate<br>
calculation unit 603 by the received signal and output the multiplied signal.<br>
[367]	Since the first pilot signal includes the portions B and C obtained by frequency-<br>
shifting the useful portion A, the respective correlation values are obtained by shifting<br>
the received signals by the respective frequency shift amounts. In the first pilot signal,<br>
the portion B is a portion which is frequency-shifted up or frequency-shifted down<br>
from the portion A, and C is a portion which is frequency-shifted up or frequency-<br>
shifted down from the portion A.<br>
[368] For example, if the output of the complex conjugate calculation unit 603 is used, the<br>
output of me first multiplier 605 may include the correlation result of B (or the<br>
complex conjugate of Bl and A (or the complex conjugate of A).<br>
[369]	The second multiplier 607 may multiply the signal output from the first multiplier<br>
605 by the frequency shift amount (denoted by ) applied to the portion B and<br>
output the multiplied signal.<br><br>
[370] The first filter 611 performs a moving average during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the second multiplier 607. The moving average<br>
portion may be the length of the cyclic prefix (B) or the length of the cyclic suffix (C).<br>
In this embodiment, the first filter 611 may calculate an average of the signal included<br>
in the length of the portion B. Then, in the result output from the first filter 611. the<br>
correlation value of the portions A and C included in the portion, of which the average<br>
is calculated, substantially becomes zero and the correlation result of the portions B<br>
and A remains. Since the signal of the portion B is multiplied by the frequency shift-<br>
value by the second multiplier 607, it is equal to the signal obtained by duplicating the<br>
second half of the portion A.<br>
[371] The third multiplier 609 may multiply the signal output from the first multiplier 605<br>
by the frequency shift amount (denoted by -ejfSHt) applied to the portion C and output<br>
the multiplied signal.<br>
[372] The second filter 613 performs a moving average during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the third multiplier 609. The moving average portion<br>
may be the length of the cyclic prefix (B) or the length of the cyclic suffix (C). In this<br>
embodiment, the second filter 613 may calculate the average of the signal included in<br>
the length of the portion C. Then, in the result output from the second filter 613, the<br>
correlation value of the portions A and B included in the portion, of which the average<br>
is calculated, substantially becomes zero and the correlation result of the portions C<br>
and A remains. Since the signal of the portion C is multiplied by the frequency shift<br>
value by the third multiplier 609, it is equal to the signal obtained by duplicating the<br>
first half of the portion A.<br>
[373] The length TB of the portion of which the moving average is performed by the first<br>
filter 611 and the second filter 613 is expressed as follows.<br>
[374] [Equation 2]<br>
[375] <br>
[376] where, k denotes an integer. In other words, the unit fSH of the frequency shift used<br>
in the portions B and C may be decided by k/TB.<br>
[377] The second delay unit 615 may delay the signal output from the first filter 611. For<br>
example, the second delay unit 615 delays the signal filtered by the first filter 611 by<br>
the length of the portion B and outputs the delayed signal.<br>
[378] The fourth multiplier 617 multiplies the signal delayed by the second delay unit 615<br>
by the signal filtered by the second filter 613 and outputs the multiplied signal.<br>
[379] The peak search unit 619 searches for the location where a peak value is generated<br><br>
from the multiplied signal output from the fourth multiplier 617 and outputs the<br>
searched location to the phase measurement unit 621. The peak value and the location<br>
may be used for the timing offset estimation.<br>
[380] The phase measurement unit 621 may measure the changed phase using the peak<br>
value and the location output from the peak search unit 619 and output the measured<br>
phase. The phase value may be used for the fractional carrier frequency offset es-<br>
timation.<br>
[381] Meanwhile, an oscillator for generating the frequency used for performing the<br>
frequency shift by the second multiplier 607 and che chird multiplier 609 may generate<br>
any phase error.<br>
[382] Even in this case, the fourth multiplier 617 can eliminate the phase error of the os-<br>
cillator. The results output from the first filter 611 and the second filter 613 and the<br>
result output from the fourth multiplier 617 may be expressed by the following<br>
equation.<br>
[383]	[Equation 3]<br>
[384] <br>
[385]	where, respectively denote the outputs of the first filter 611 and the<br>
second filter 613, and yProd denotes the output of the fourth multiplier- 617. In<br>
addition, al and a2 respectively denote the levels of the correlation results and f and re-<br>
spectively denote the frequency offset and the phase error of the oscillator.<br>
[386] Accordingly, include the phase errors ofthe oscillator having<br>
different signs, but the phase error, of the oscillator is eliminated in the result of the<br>
fourth multiplier 617. Accordingly, the frequency offset f can be estimated regardless<br>
of the phase error of the oscillator of the signal receiving apparatus.<br>
[387] The estimated frequency offset may be expressed by the following equation.<br>
[388]	[Equation 4]<br>
[389] <br>
[390]	where, the estimated frequency offset f is 0
[391]<br>
[392]	FIG. 52 is a view showing another embodiment of the structure of the first pilot<br>
signal. In the first pilot signal, the frequency shift of the first half of the useful portion<br><br>
A is the cyclic prefix (B) and the frequency shift of the second shift of the useful<br>
portion A is the cyclic suffix (C). The lengths of the useful portion A for generating the<br>
portions B and C may be, for example, 1/2 of the length of the portion A, and the<br>
lengths of B and C may be different.<br>
[393] <br>
[394] FIG. 53 is a view showing an embodiment of detecting the first pilot signal shown in<br>
FIG. 52 and measuring a timing offset and a frequency offset using the detected result.<br>
In this embodiment, for convenience of description. B and C respectively denote the<br>
cyclic prefix and the cyclic suffix obtained by frequency-shifting 1/2 of the length of<br>
the portion A.<br>
[395]	This embodiment includes a first delay unit 601, a complex conjugate calculation<br>
unit 603, a first multiplier 605, a second multiplier 607, a first filter 611, a second<br>
delay unit 615, a third multiplier 609, a second filter 613, a fourth multiplier 617, a<br>
peak search unit 619, and a phase measurement unit 621. That is, this embodiment is<br>
equal to the embodiment of FIG. 51, but the features of the components may be<br>
changed according to the length of the portion A by which the portions B and C are<br>
generated. B denotes a portion frequency-shifted down from the portion A, and C<br>
denotes a portion frequency-shifted up from the portion A.<br>
[396] The first delay unit 601 may delay a received signal. For example, the first delay unit<br>
601 may delay the received signal by 1/2 of the length of the useful symbol portion A<br>
of the first pilot signal.<br>
[397] The complex conjugate calculation unit 603 may calculate the complex conjugate of<br>
the delayed first pilot signal and output the calculated signal.<br>
[398]	The first multiplier 605 may multiply the signal output from the complex conjugate <br>
calculation unit 603 by the received signal and output the multiplied signal.<br>
[399] The second multiplier 607 may multiply the signal output from the first multiplier<br>
605 by the frequency shift amount (denoted by ejfSHt) applied to the portion B and<br>
output the multiplied signal.<br>
[400] The first filter 611 performs a moving average during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the second multiplier 607. The moving average<br>
portion may be the length of the cyclic prefix (B). In this embodiment, the first filter<br>
611 may calculate the average of the signal included in the length of the portion B.<br>
Then, in the result output from the first filter 611, the correlation value of the portions<br>
A and C included in the portion, of which the average is calculated, substantially<br>
becomes zero and the correlation result of the portions B and A remains. Since the<br>
signal of the portion B is multiplied by the frequency shift value by the second<br>
multiplier 607, it is equal to the signal obtained by duplicating the second half of the<br>
portion A.<br><br>
[401]	The third multiplier 609 may multiply the signal output from the first multiplier 605<br>
by the frequency shift amount (denoted by -ejfSHt) applied to the portion C and output<br>
the multiplied signal.<br>
[402]	The second filter 613 performs a moving average during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the third multiplier 609. The moving average portion "<br>
may be the length of the cyclic suffix (C). In this embodiment, the second filter<br>
613may calculate the average of the signal included in the length of the portion C.<br>
Then, in the result output from the second filter 613, the correlation value of A and B<br>
included in the portion, of which the average is calculated, substantially becomes zero<br>
and the correlation result of the portions C and A remains. Since the signal of the<br>
portion C is multiplied by the frequency shift value by the third multiplier 609, it is<br>
equal to the signal obtained by duplicating the first half of the portion A.<br>
[403] The second delay unit 615 may delay the signal output from the first filter 611. For<br>
example, the second delay unit 615 delays the signal filtered by the first filter 611 by<br>
the length of the portion B + 1/2A and outputs the delayed signal.<br>
[404]	The fourth multiplier 617 multiplies the signal delayed by the second delay unit 615<br>
by the signal filtered by the second filter 613 and outputs the multiplied signal.<br>
[405]	The peak search unit 619 searches for the location where a peak value is generated<br>
from the multiplied signal output from the fourth multiplier 617 and outputs the<br>
searched location to the phase measurement unit 621. The peak value and the location<br>
may be used for the timing offset estimation.<br>
[406]	The phase measurement unit 621 may measure the changed phase using the peak<br>
value and the location output from the peak search unit 619 and output the measured<br>
phase. The phase value may be used for the fractional carrier frequency offset es-<br>
timation.<br>
[407]	As described above, an oscillator for generating the frequency used for performing<br>
the frequency shift by the second multiplier 607 and the third multiplier 609 may<br>
generate any phase error. However, even in this embodiment, the fourth multiplier 617<br>
can eliminate the phase error of the oscillator.<br>
[408] The results output from the first filter 611 and the second filter 613 and the result<br>
output from the fourth multiplier 617 may be expressed by the following equation.<br>
[409]	[Equation 5]<br>
[410] <br><br>
[411]	where, respectively denote the outputs of the first filter 611 and the<br>
second filter 613. and yPnxI denotes the output of the fourth multiplier 6-17. In addition,<br>
al and a2 respectively denote the levels of the correlation results and f and respectively<br>
denote the frequency offset and the phase error of the oscillator.<br>
[412] Accordingly. yMAF1 and yMAF2may include the phase errors of the oscillator<br>
having different signs, but the phase error of the oscillator is eliminated in the result of<br>
the fourth multiplier 617. Accordingly, the frequency offset f can beestimated re-<br>
gardless of the phase error of the oscillator of the signal receiving apparatus.<br>
[413] The estimated frequency offset may be expressed by the following equation.<br>
[414] [Equation 6]<br>
[415] <br>
[416] where, the estimated frequency offset f is 0
[417] That is, phase aliasing may be generated in a range of 0.5
offset estimated in [Equation 4], but phase aliasing is not generated in the frequency<br>
offset estimated in [Equation 6]. Accordingly, the frequency offset can be more ac-<br>
curately measured. The structure of the first pilot signal may be used in the data<br>
symbol and the second frequency signal. If such a structure is used, offset estimation<br>
performance such as C\V interference can be improved and the reception performance<br>
of the receiver can be improved.<br>
[418]<br>
[419] FIG. 54 is a view showing an embodiment of detecting the first pilot signal and<br>
measuring a timing offset and a frequency offset using the detected result.<br>
[420] This embodiment includes a first delay unit 601, a third delay unit 602, a first<br>
complex conjugate calculation unit 603, a second complex conjugate calculation unit<br>
604, a first multiplier 605, a fifth multiplier 606, a second multiplier 607, a first filter<br>

multiplier 617. a peak search unit 619, and a phase measurement unit 621.<br>
[421] In this embodiment, the first delay unit 601 may delay a received signal. For<br>
example, the first delay unit 601 may delay the received signal by the length of the<br>
cyclic suffix.<br>
[422] The third delay unit 602 may delay the signal delayed by the first delay unit 601. For-<br>
example, the third delay unit 602 further delays the signal by a difference between the<br>
length of the cyclic prefix and the length of the cyclic suffix.<br>
[423] The first complex conjugate calculation unit 603 may calculate the complex<br>
conjugate of the signal delayed by the third delay unit 602 and output the calculated<br>
signal. The second complex conjugate calculation unit 604 may calculate the complex<br><br>
conjugate of the signal delayed by the first delay unit 601 and output the calculated<br>
signal.<br>
[424] The first multiplier 605 may multiply the signal output from the first complex<br>
conjugate calculation unit 603 by the received signal and output the multiplied signal.<br>
The fifth multiplier 606 may multiply the complex conjugate calculated by the second<br>
complex conjugate calculation unit 604 by the received signal and output the<br>
multiplied signal.<br>
[425] The second multiplier 607 may multiply the signal output from the first multiplier<br>
605 by the frequency shift amount (denoted by e) applied to the portion B and<br>
output the multiplied signal.<br>
[426] The first filter 611 performs a moving average during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the second multiplier 607. The moving average<br>
portion may be the length of the useful portion (A) of the first pilot signal.<br>
[427] The third multiplier 609 may multiply the signal output from the second multiplier<br>
604by the frequency shift amount (denoted by ) applied to the portion C and<br>
output the multiplied signal.<br>
[428]	The second filter 613 performs a moving average, during a predetermined period with<br>
respect to the signal output from the third multiplier 609. The moving average portion<br>
may be the length of the useful portion A of the first pilot signal.<br>
[429] The second delay unit 615 may delay the signal output from the first filter 611. For<br>
example, the second delay unit 615 delays the signal filtered by the first filter 611 by<br>
the length of the useful portion (A) of the first pilot signal and outputs the delayed<br>
signal.<br>
[430] The fourth multiplier 617 multiplies the signal delayed by the second delay unit 615<br>
by the signal filtered by the second filter 613 and outputs the multiplied signal.The<br>
fourth multiplier 617 may eliminate the phase error of the oscillator.<br>
[431]	The operations of the peak search unit 619 and the phase measurement unit 621 are<br>
equal to those of the above-described embodiment. The peak search unit 619 searches<br>
for the location where a peak value is generated from the multiplied signal output from<br>
the fourth multiplier 617 and outputs the searched location to the phase measurement<br>
unit 621. The peak value and the location may be used for the timing offset estimation.<br>
[432]<br>
[433] FIG. 55 is a view showing an embodiment of a method of transmitting a signal.<br>
[434]	A service stream is converted to a PLP (S110). The PLP can be generated by<br>
modulating a service streamsuch as a transport stream and a GSE packet, in which<br>
error correction encoding and symbol mapping areperformed on the service stream.<br>
The modulated service stream can be distributed in at least one signal frame and can be<br>
transmitted over at least one physical channel as a PLP. For example, a process of<br><br>
modulating a service stream to aPLP can be performed by following steps S110a to<br>
S110d.<br>
[435] A service stream such as a transport stream and a GSE packet transferring service is<br>
error-correction-coded (S110a). An error correction coding scheme may be changed<br>
according to the service streams.<br>
[436] An LDPC error correction coding scheme may be used as the error correction coding<br>
scheme and the error correction coding may be performed at various code rates. The<br>
bits which are error-correction-coded according to a specific error correction code rate<br>
may be included in an error correction coded block according to the error correction<br>
coding mode. If the error correction coding scheme is the LDPC, a normal mode<br>
(64800 bits) and a short mode (16200 bits) may be used.<br>
[437] The error-correction-coded service stream is interleaved (S110b). The interleaving<br>
may be performed by differentiating the directions for writing and reading the bits<br>
included in the error correction coded block in and from a memory. The number of<br>
rows and the number of columns of the memory may be changed according to the error<br>
correction coding mode. The interleaving may be performed in the unit of the error<br>
correction coded blocks.<br>
[438] The interleaved bits of the service stream are mapped to symbols (S110c). A symbol<br>
mapping method may be changed according to service streams or in the service stream.<br>
For example, as the symbol mapping method, a higher order symbol mapping method<br>
and a lower order symbol mapping method may be used. When the symbols are<br>
mapped, the interleaved bits of the service stream may be demultiplexed according to<br>
the symbol mapping method or the code rate of the error correction code, and the<br>
symbols may be mapped using the bits included in the demultiplexed sub streams.<br>
Then, the sequence of the bits in the cell word mapped to the symbols may be changed.<br>
[439] The mapped symbols are interleaved (S110d). The mapped symbols may be in-<br>
terleaved in the unit of error correction coded blocks. Time interleaves 132a and 132b<br>
may interleave the symbols in the unit of error correction coded blocks. That is, the<br>
service stream is interleaved again in the symbol level.<br>
[440] The PLP converted as described above is allocated in at least one signal frame and a<br>
preamble including a first pilot signal is arranged in a beginning part of the signal<br>
frame (S150). The allocation of the PLP may be described as follow.<br>
[441] The interleaved symbols of the service stream are split, the split symbols are<br>
allocated to a signal frame having at least one frequency band and including slots<br>
which are temporally split in the frequency bands, and a preamble including a first<br>
pilot signal is arranged in a start portion of the signal frame. The interleaved symbols<br>
of the service stream may configure the PLP with respect to the service stream for<br>
providing the service. The symbols configuring the PLP may be split and allocated to<br><br>
the signal frame. The PLP may be allocated to at least one signal frame having at least<br>
one frequency band. If a plurality of frequency bands is arranged, the symbols con-<br>
figuring the PLP may be arranged in the slots shifted between the frequency bands.<br>
The bits included in the service stream may be arranged in.the signal frame in the unit<br>
of interleaved error correction coded blocks.<br>
[442] The signal frame is converted into a time domain according to an OFDM scheme<br>
(S160).<br>
[443] The cyclic prefix obtained by frequency-shifting a first portion of an useful portion<br>
of the first pilot signal and the cyclic suffix obtained by frequency-shifting a second<br>
portion of the useful portion are inserted into the first pilot signal in the time domain .<br>
(S170). If the preamble is not inserted in the frequency domain, the preamble including<br>
the first pilot signal and the second pilot signal may be inserted in the time domain.<br>
The first pilot signal of the time domain may include the useful portion, the cyclic<br>
prefix of the first portion of the useful portion and the cyclic suffix of the second<br>
portion of the useful portion. The first portion may be a backmost portion or the<br>
foremost portion of the useful portion. The second portion maybe the foremost portion<br>
or the backmost portion of the useful portion.<br>
[444] The signal frame including the first frame signal is transmitted over at least one RF<br>
channel (S180).<br>
[445] Since the useful portion of the first pilot signal includes the frequency-shifted cyclic<br>
prefix and cyclic suffix, the signal frame can be clearly identified as the structure of the<br>
first pilot signal. The timing offset or the frequency offset may be estimated and com-<br>
pensated for using the structure of the first pilot signal.<br>
[446]<br>
[447] FIG. 56 is a view showing an embodiment of a method of receiving a signal.<br>
[448] A signal is received from a specific frequency band transferring signal frames<br>
(S210). The signal frame may be transmitted over at least one frequency band. The<br>
signal may be received from a specific frequency band<br>
[449] From the received signal, a first pilot signal including a cyclic prefix obtained by<br>
frequency-shifting a first portion of an useful portion and a cyclic suffix obtained by<br>
frequency-shifting a second portion of the useful portion is identified, and the signal<br>
frame including the PLPs is identified is demodulated by the OFDM scheme using the<br>
first pilot signal (S220). The demodulating process using information set in the first<br>
pilot signal will be described in detail later.<br>
[450] The identified signal frame is parsed (S230). The signal frame may include at least<br>
one frequency band. In the signal frame, a first PLP including the error correction<br>
coded blocks of the symbols, to which the service stream is mapped, may be allocated<br>
to OFDM symbols together with a second PLP including the error correction coded<br><br>
blocks of another service stream. If the signal frame includes a plurality of frequency<br>
bands, the error correction coded blocks of the PLP may be allocated to the OFDM<br>
symbols which are temporally shifted in the plurality of frequency bands.<br>
[451]	A service can be obtained from the PLP of the parsed signal frame (S240), in which<br>
this process is described in steps S240a to S240c.<br>
[452]	The symbols, to which the service stream is mapped, are deinterleaved from the<br>
parsed signal frame. (S240a). The deinterleaving may be performed in the symbol level<br>
which the service stream is mapped to. For example, the time deinterleavers 245aand<br>
245b may deinterleave the error correction coded blocks including the symbols, to<br>
which the service stream is mapped.<br>
[453] Then, the deinterleaved symbols are demapped so as to obtain the service stream<br>
(S240b). When the symbols are demapped, a plurality of sub streams obtained by<br>
demapping the symbols may be output, the output sub streams may be multiplexed,<br>
and the error-correcrion-coded service stream may beoutput. The multiplexing scheme<br>
may be changed according to the symbol mapping method and the error correction<br>
code rate. The symbol demapping method may be changed in one service stream or<br>
according to sendee streams.<br>
[454] The service stream is deinterleaved and the deinterleaved service stream is error-<br>
correction-coded (240c).<br>
[455] According to an apparatus for transmitting and receiving a signal and a method for<br>
transmitting and receiving a signal of an embodiment of the present invention, it is<br>
possible to readily detect and restore a transmitted signal. In addition, it is possible to<br>
improve the signal transmission/reception performance of the transmitting/receiving<br>
system.<br>
[456]<br>
[457] FIG. 57 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of identifying a first pilot signal<br>
and estimating an offset in a demodulating process.<br>
[458] The first pilot signal includes the cyclic prefix obtained by frequency-shifting the<br>
first portion of the useful portion thereof and the cyclic suffix obtained by frequency-<br>
shifting the second portion of the useful portion thereof. The timing.offset and the<br>
frequency offset may be calculated using the first pilot signal as follows.<br>
[459] The received signal is delayed (S311). For example, the delay portion may be the<br>
useful portion of the first pilot signal or 1/2 of the useful portion. Alternatively, the<br>
delay portion may be the length of the cyclic prefix or the length of the cyclic suffix.<br>
[460]	The complex conjugate of the delayed signal is calculated (S313).<br>
[461] The complex conjugate of the received signal and the delayed signal are multiplied<br>
(S315). The delayed signal multiplied by the complex conjugate-may be the signal<br>
having the above-described length. If the delay signal is the length of the cyclic prefix<br><br>
or the cyclic suffix, the complex conjugate of the delayed signal may be calculated.<br>
[462] The signal multiplied by the complex conjugate is inversely shifted according to the<br>
frequency shift of the cyclic prefix (S317). That is, the signal multiplied by the<br>
complex conjugate is shifted by the inverse shift amount of the frequency shift amount<br>
of the cyclic prefix signal. That is, a signal which is frequency shifted up is frequency<br>
- shifted down (or the signal which is frequency shifted down is frequency shifted up).<br>
[463]	Then, an average is calculated with respect to the signal which is inversely shifted<br>
according to the frequency shift of the cyclic prefix (S319). The portion of which the<br>
average is calculated may be the length of the cyclic prefix or the length of the useful<br>
portion A of the first pilot signal depending onthe embodiments. Since the average is<br>
calculated with respect to the signal having the same length along with the received<br>
signal, the moving average value may be output along with the received signal.<br>
[464] The signal of which the average is calculated is delayed (S321). The delay portion<br>
may be the sum of the length of the cyclic prefix and the length of 1/2 of the useful<br>
period, the length of the cyclic prefix, or the length of the useful portion A of the first<br>
pilot signal, according to the embodiment.<br>
[465] The signal multiplied in the step S315 is inversely shifted according to the frequency<br>
shift of the cyclic suffix (S323). The signal multiplied by the complex conjugate is<br>
shifted bythe inverse shift amount of the frequency shift amount of the cyclic suffix<br>
signal. That is. a signal which is frequency shifted up is frequency shifted down (or the<br>
signal which is frequency shifted down is frequency shifted up).<br>
[466] An average is calculated with respect to the signal which is inversely shifted<br>
according to the frequency shift of the cyclic suffix (S325). The moving average is<br>
performed with respect to the signal corresponding to the length of the calculated<br>
cyclic suffix or the length of the useful portion of the first pilot signal according to the<br>
embodiments.<br>
[467] The signal delayed in the step S321 and the signal of which the average iscalculated<br>
in the step S325 are multiplied (S327).<br>
[46S] A peak location of the multiplied result is searched for(S329) and the phase of the<br>
signal is measured using the peak (S331). The searched peak may be used for es-<br>
timating the timing offset and the measured phase may be used for estimating the<br>
frequency offset.<br>
[469] In this flowchart, the length of the cyclic suffix, the length of the cyclic prefix and<br>
the frequency inverse shift amount may be changed.<br>
[470] According to the apparatus for transmitting and receiving the signal and the method<br>
for transmitting and receiving the signal of the invention, if the data symbol con-<br>
figuring the PLP and the symbols configuring the preamble are modulated in the same<br>
EFT mode, the probability that the data symbol is detected bythe preamble is low and<br><br>
The probability that the preamble is erroneously detected is reduced. If continuous<br>
wave (CW) interference is included like the analog TV signal, the probability that the<br>
preamble is erroneously detected by a noise DC component generated at the time of<br>
correlation is reduced.<br>
[471] According to the apparatus for transmitting and receiving the signal and the method<br>
for transmitting and receiving the signal of the invention, if the size of the FFT applied<br>
to the data symbol configuring the PLP is larger than that of the FFT applied to the<br>
preamble, the preamble detecting performance may be improved even in a delay<br>
spread channel having a length equal to or greater than that of the usefulsymbol portion<br>
A of the preamble. Since both the cyclic prefix (B) and the cyclic suffix (C) are used in<br>
the preamble, the fractional carrier frequency offset can be estimated.<br>
[472]	The disclosed structure of the pilot signal may not be used for a signal frame<br>
including the PLP, and if the pilot signal is used for any signal frame, the described<br>
effect can be taken.<br>
