				<td>PIGMENT DISPERSANTS, PIGMENT DISPERSIONS<br>
AND WRITING OR RECORDING PIGMENT INKS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
a) Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to dispersants for organic<br>
pigments (hereinafter simply referred to as "pig-<br>
ments"), pigment dispersions and writing or recording<br>
pigment inks, and more specifically to pigment dis-<br>
persants and also to pigment dispersions making use of<br>
the pigment dispersants, having excellent fluidity,<br>
dispersion stability, storage stability and the like<br>
and suited especially for the production of writing or<br>
recording pigment inks.<br>
b) Description of the Related Art<br>
Marking inks for use in writing instruments,<br>
which make use of bundled fiber tips or felt tips, have<br>
conventionally been made of resins, pigments and sol-<br>
vents, and as the pigments, dyes have been employed.<br>
As the solvents, ester or aromatic solvents have been<br>
used from the standpoint of solubility for the resins<br>
and also solubility for the dyes.<br>
It is however desired to avoid use of aromatic<br>
solvents, because they give deleterious effects on the<br>
health of workers (organic solvent intoxication) and<br>
they themselves are air pollutants. Although there is<br>
a move toward water-based writing inks, solvent-based<br>
maker pens are still employed widely. This can be at-<br>
tributed to the excellent writing performance of<br>
solvent-based inks on plastic films such as poly-<br>
ethylene films and also to the superb drying character-<br>
istics of the solvent-based inks shortly after written<br>
on plastic films.<br>
Ink-jet printing, on the other hand, is a digital<br>
printing controlled by a computer. Printing informa-<br>
tion signals are supplied to a printer directly from<br>
the computer, so that no plate-making is needed. Ink-<br>
jet printing is therefore suited particularly for the<br>
printing of various images in small numbers of copies,<br>
and recent advancements in ink-jet printers have made<br>
it possible to perform printing of a variety of highly-<br>
detailed large images.<br>
Ink-jet printing inks are required to have low<br>
viscosity and excellent stability. There are organic-<br>
solvent-based inks making use of dyes, but as pigment-<br>
type inks, water-based inks are used because ink-jet<br>
printing inks making use of pigments involve technical<br>
difficulties. However, water-based inks contain, as<br>
vehicles, resins at extremely low concentrations so<br>
that good color developments are not available. Water-<br>
based inks are also accompanied by a problem of adhe-<br>
sion to plastic films. Under these circumstances,<br>
there is a strong desire for the development of<br>
alcohol-based ink-jet printing inks making use of pig-<br>
ments and assuring good color developments.<br>
Incidentally, as is observed from paints and the<br>
like, the conventional technology expects much on the<br>
dispersing power of a resin for a pigment upon dispers-<br>
ing the pigment on a resin solution. When the dispers-<br>
ing power of the resin is insufficient for the pigment,<br>
a pigment dispersant (pigment treatment) (hereinafter<br>
simply referred to as "a pigment dispersant) has been<br>
employed. In general paints, sufficient dispersion of<br>
pigments is feasible with conventional dispersants.<br>
Compared with paints, however, writing or record-<br>
ing pigment inks are required to have extremely low<br>
viscosity and in addition, to have an extremely high<br>
degree of dispersion of pigments. Despite these re-<br>
quirements, use of conventional resins and dispersants<br>
is unable to achieve sufficient dispersion of pigments<br>
or leads to changes in the viscosity of pigment disper-<br>
sions along the passage of time due to desorption of<br>
the dispersant from the pigments and insufficient com-<br>
patibility between the pigments and the resins, thereby<br>
making it extremely difficult to obtain pigment disper-<br>
sions which meet the property and performance require-<br>
ments .<br>
If an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol can be<br>
used as a solvent in an organic-solvent-based pigment<br>
ink, deleterious effects on the health of users of<br>
writing instruments and people studying or working in<br>
the same environment as the users can be reduced, the<br>
problem of air pollution can be lessened owing to the<br>
avoidance of an organic solvent, and further, the prob-<br>
lems of drying characteristics and wetting to plastic<br>
films, said problems being inherent to water-based<br>
inks, can also be eliminated. Moverover, alcoholic<br>
solvents are resources reproducible in the natural<br>
world so that use of such solvents is preferred. None-<br>
theless, with resins soluble in conventionally-known<br>
alcoholic solvents, it is still extremely difficult to<br>
obtain pigment inks satisfactory in the requirements<br>
for low viscosity, high dispersion and high dispersion<br>
stability even if dispersants are used.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore<br>
to provide a dispersant which is excellent in the dis-<br>
persibility of pigments and permits production of a<br>
pigment dispersion excellent in the stability of vis-<br>
cosity. Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a pigment dispersion, writing ink or recording<br>
ink, which is using a pigment as a coloring matter,<br>
contains a resin - which is soluble in an organic sol-<br>
vent, especially an alcoholic solvent - in a sufficient<br>
amount relative to the pigment, has a low viscosity,<br>
good pigment dispersibility and excellent viscosity<br>
stability, and gives less deleterious effects on the<br>
health of a user of a writing instrument or recording<br>
apparatus and people studying or working in the same<br>
environment as the user.<br>
To achieve the above-described objects, the pres-<br>
ent invention provides an dispersant for organic pig-<br>
ments, comprising a compound represented by the follow-<br>
ing formula (I):<br>
wherein X and X' each independently represent a<br>
hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a<br>
primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, or an acylamino<br>
group; Y represents an anthraquinonylamino, phenylamino<br>
or phenoxy group having a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl<br>
group, an alkoxy group, a primary, secondary or<br>
tertiary amino group, or an acylamino group at the 4-<br>
position or 5-position thereof; A and B each indepen-<br>
dently represent an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or<br>
an aryl group, and at least one of A and B has at least<br>
one substituent group containing a basic nitrogen atom;<br>
and Z represents a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, a<br>
halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a nitro<br>
group, a benzoylamino group or a 3-benzoyl group, and<br>
the 3-benzoyl group may be fused together with X to<br>
form an acridone ring; a pigment dispersion comprising<br>
an organic pigment, a dispersant, a film-forming resin<br>
and an organic solvent, wherein the dispersant is the<br>
above-described dispersant; a writing or recording pig-<br>
ment ink comprising the dispersion; and a writing in-<br>
strument or recording apparatus comprising the ink (the<br>
pigment dispersion and the writing ink or recording ink<br>
will hereinafter be collectively called "the ink").<br>
The term "at least one substituent group contain-<br>
ing a basic nitrogen atom" as used herein may mean a<br>
primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, a<br>
quaternary ammonium group or a pyridinium group, with a<br>
tertiary amino group being particularly preferred.<br>
The dispersant according to the present invention<br>
is useful as a dispersant for a variety of<br>
conventionally-Known pigments, especially as a dis-<br>
persant for various pigments used as coloring matters<br>
in inks, various paints, various printing inks, various<br>
pigment printing agents and synthetic resins. In par-<br>
ticular, use of the dispersant according to the present<br>
invention by adding it as a dispersant to red, green<br>
yellow and purple inks makes it possible to stably pro-<br>
duce low-viscosity inks and eventually to obtain ex-<br>
cellent inks.<br>

Inks according to the present invention are<br>
formed of the above-described dispersants, pigments,<br>
film-forming resins and organic solvents.<br>
Conventionally-known pigments are all usable as pig-<br>

Conventionally-known organic solvents employed in<br>
various paints, coating formulations, printing inks and<br>
the like are all usable as organic solvents in the<br>
present invention. When using inks according to the<br>
present invention as inks for writing instruments or<br>
recording apparatuses, use of alcoholic solvents is<br>
preferred. As alcoholic solvents, solvents containing<br>
alcohols the boiling points of which are 150°C or lower<br>
are preferred. Alcohols amount to at least 10 wt.%,<br>
preferably to 50 to 100 wt.% of alcoholic solvents.<br>
Preferred examples of alcohols can include<br>
ethanol, propanol, methoxypropanol, ethoxypropanol, and<br>
propyloxyethanol. They can be used either singly or in<br>
combination. Solvents other than these alcohols can<br>
also be used to extents not contrary to the spirit of<br>
the present invention. For example, ethyl acetate,<br>
propyl acetate, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethyl-<br>
cyclohexane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone<br>
and the like can be used in combination.<br>
The film-forming resin (hereinafter simply<br>
referred to as a "resin") employed in the present in-<br>
vention is required to be soluble in the above-<br>
described organic solvent, especially the alcoholic<br>
solvent descried above. Such a resin comprises, as<br>
constituent monomers, an addition-polymerizing monomer<br>
containing a carboxyl group, a hydroxy1 group or an<br>
amido group and a monomer addition-polymerizable with<br>
the addition-polymerizing monomer. A description will<br>
hereinafter be made about the monomers which make up<br>
the resin for use in the present invention.<br>
Examples of the carboxyl-containing monomer can<br>
include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; fumaric<br>
acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, alkyl monoesters<br>
thereof, and hydroxyalkyl monoesters thereof; and<br>
monoesters between hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, such<br>
as hydroxyethyl (raeth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, and dibasic acids, for example, suc-<br>
cinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and cyclohexane-<br>
dicarboxylic acid anhydride. Incidentally, acrylic<br>
acid and methacrylic acid will be called (meth) acrylic<br>
acid in the present invention.<br>
Examples of the hydroxy1-containing monomer can<br>
include hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, for example,<br>
hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydropropyl<br>
(meth)acrylate; esters of monoesters between the above-<br>
described hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates and dibasic<br>
aqids with dihydroxyalkyl compounds, for example,<br>
monoesters of monoesters between hydroxyethyl<br>
(meth) acrylate and hydroxypropyl (meth) acrylate and<br>
succinic acid, phthalic acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic<br>
acid with dihydroxyalkyl compounds such as ethylene<br>
glycol and propylene glycol. The carbon numbers of the<br>
alkyl groups in the above-described carboxyl- and<br>
hydroxyl-containing monomers range from about 1 to 12.<br>
Examples of the amido-containing monomer can in-<br>
clude (meth)acrylamides and N-substituted (meth)acryl-<br>
amides, for example, (meth)acrylic butoxymethylamide,<br>
N-tert-butylacrylamide, N-tert-butylmethacrylamide,<br>
diacetoneacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylaraide, N-methylol-<br>
(meth)acrylamide, and N-alkyloxyethyl (meth)acrylamide.<br>
In addition to the above-described monomers,<br>
addition-polymerizing monomers copolymerizable with the<br>
above-described respective monomers can be used to ex-<br>
tents soluble in the alcoholic solvent in order to im-<br>
part waterproofness, flexibility and/or other physical<br>
properties to the resin. Examples of such monomers can<br>
include (meth)acrylate esters, for example, methyl<br>
(meth)aerylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, octyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, isobornyl (meth)acrylate, and tetraful-<br>
furyl (meth)acrylate; styrene and styrene derivatives,<br>
for example, a-methylstyrene; dialkyl esters of dibasic<br>
acids, for example, dialkyl maleates, dialkyl<br>
fumarates, and dialkyl itaconates; and vinyl acetate,<br>
and (roeth)acrylonitrile.<br>
The resin for use in the present invention can be<br>
obtained by using the above-described monomers and<br>
copolymerizing them, for example, by suspension<br>
polymerization or solution polymerization, which uses<br>
an alcoholic solvent, in the presence or absence of a<br>
conventionally-known radical polymerization initiator.<br>
As a resin for use in the present invention, it is<br>
preferred to use a resin in which a monomer between an<br>
alkyl (meth) acrylate and a dibasic acid - said monomer<br>
being represented by the following formula: CH2=C(R1)-<br>
COO-R2-0-CO-R3-COOH in which R1 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom or a methyl group, R2 represents an alkylene chain<br>
which contains 2 to 6 carbon atoms and may contain a<br>
branched chain, R3 represents an alkylene group which<br>
may contain a branched chain or unsaturated group - is<br>
copolymerized at least a part of a copolymer. A blend<br>
of the copolymer with a copolymer free of the above-<br>
described specific monomers may also be used.<br>
Whichever resin is used, it is preferred to contain<br>
units of a monoester monomer between hydroxyalkyl<br>
(meth) acrylate and a dibasic acid in a proportion of<br>
from 1 to 50 wt.%, preferably from 3 to 4 0 wt.% based<br>
on the whole resin. If the content of the monomer<br>
units is too low, the resin is not very effective for<br>
dispersing pigments. If the content of the monomer<br>
units is too high, on the other hand, writing matter or<br>
printed matter has lowered alkali resistance. It is<br>
therefore not preferred to contain the monomer units<br>
outside the above range.<br>
To obtain the resin by copolymerizing a mixture<br>
of the above-described monomers, the monoester of the<br>
hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and the dibasic acid may<br>
account preferably for 1 to 50 wt.%, more preferably<br>
for 3 to 40 wt.% of the monomer mixture. The propor-<br>
tion (s) of other monomer(s) can be suitably determined<br>
such that the resulting resin is soluble in the al-<br>
coholic solvent and can satisfy its performance re-<br>
quirements, and no particular limitation is imposed on<br>
their proportions. The number average molecular weight<br>
of the resin (the number average molecular weight as<br>
obtained by measuring the resin by GPC and converting<br>
the data with reference to the corresponding data of<br>
standard polystyrene) ranges generally from 2,000 to<br>
100,000, preferably from 2,000 to 50,000. The acid<br>
value of the resin ranges generally from 0.5 to 300<br>
mgKOH/g, preferably from 5 to 180 mgKOH/mg.<br>
The ink according to the present invention can be<br>
produced in a similar manner as in the production of<br>
conventional inks and paints by using the above-<br>
described pigment, dispersant, film-forming resin and<br>
organic solvent, and no particular limitation is im-<br>
posed on the production method itself. Illustrative<br>
productions methods can include a method in which the<br>
pigment, subsequent to its advance treatment with the<br>
dispersant, is dispersed in a solution of the resin in<br>
an alcoholic solvent; and a method in which the un-<br>
treated pigment and the dispersant are mixed with the<br>
resin solution and the pigment is subjected to disper-<br>
sion processing in a disperser.<br>
When the method that the pigment, subsequent to<br>
its advance treatment with the dispersant, is dispersed<br>
in the solution of the resin in the alcoholic solvent<br>
is adopted, the treatment of the pigment can be prac-<br>
ticed, for example, as will be described next. (1)<br>
Subsequent to dissolution of the pigment and the dis-<br>
persant in sulfuric acid or the like, the resultant<br>
solution is poured into water. The thus-obtained mix-<br>
ture is alkalinized to have both of the pigment and<br>
dispersant precipitated as a solid solution. The solid<br>
solution is collected by filtration, washed with water,<br>
dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained<br>
in a treated form. (2) The dispersant is converted<br>
into a salt with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
acetic acid or the like. The salt is mixed with the<br>
pigment in water and, if necessary, the resultant mix-<br>
ture is subjected to dispersion processing in a dis-<br>
perser to have the dispersant adsorbed on pigment sur-<br>
faces. The thus-treated pigment is caused to<br>
precipitate under alkaline condition, collected by fil-<br>
tration, washed with water, dried and then ground,<br>
whereby the pigment is obtained in the treated form.<br>
(3) The dispersant is dissolved in a liquid organic<br>
acid such as acetic acid, followed by the addition of<br>
the pigment. After the dispersant is allowed to be ad-<br>
sorbed on pigment surfaces with optional dispersing<br>
processing in a disperser, the thus-treated pigment is<br>
collected by filtration, washed with an alkaline solu-<br>
tion, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby<br>
the pigment is obtained in the treated form. The<br>
treated pigment obtained as described above is dis-<br>
persed in the solution of the resin in an alcoholic<br>
solvent to produce the ink of the present invention.<br>
When the method that the untreated pigment and<br>
the dispersant are mixed with the resin solution and<br>
the pigment is subjected to dispersion processing in a<br>
disperser is adopted, the pigment and the dispersant<br>
are added to the solution of the resin in the alcoholic<br>
solvent and subsequent to optional provisional agita-<br>
tion, the mixture is dispersed in a disperser to obtain<br>
an ink. No particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
disperser which can be used in the present invention.<br>
Examples can include a kneader, an attritor, a ball<br>
mill, a sand mill and a horizontal disperser with tum-<br>
bling means contained therein, said sand mill and<br>
horizontal disperser making use of glass, zircon or the<br>
like, and a colloid mill. Upon using the dispersant-<br>
treated pigment, it is also possible to further dis-<br>
perse the dispersant-treated pigment in a solid resin<br>
to obtain pigment chips and then to dissolve the pig-<br>
ment chips in an alcoholic solvent to obtain an ink.<br>
Subsequent to the dissolution of the pigment chips, a<br>
resin may be added as needed.<br>
Pigment chips can be obtained, for example, by<br>
one of the following methods: (1) A solid resin ob-<br>
tained by suspension polymerization or a solid resin<br>
collected from a resin solution obtained by solution<br>
polymerization and a dispersant-treated pigment are<br>
kneaded under heat by using a kneader, a Banbury mixer,<br>
a mixing roll, a three-roll mill or the like either<br>
singly or in combination such that the pigment is dis-<br>
persed in the resin. The resultant pigment-dispersed<br>
resin is then ground or chopped to obtain chips. (2) A<br>
solution of a resin in a water-soluble solvent and a<br>
presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment are mixed in<br>
a kneader, followed by heating to the softening point<br>
of the resin or higher to remove water. If necessary,<br>
the pigment is dispersed by using a three-roll mill, an<br>
extruder or the like. The resultant pigment-dispersed<br>
resin is ground or chopped to obtain pigment chips.<br>
(3) A presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment and a<br>
solid resin are subjected to flushing at the softening<br>
temperature of the resin or higher.<br>
In the ink according to the present invention,<br>
the above-described dispersant may be used generally in<br>
a proportion of from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight,<br>
preferably in a proportion of from 1 to 30 parts by<br>
weight per 100 parts by weight of the pigment. On the<br>
other hand, the pigment may be used generally in a pro-<br>
portion of from 5 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts<br>
by weight of the resin.<br>
The concentration of the pigment in the ink ac-<br>
cording to the present invention may be from 0.3 to 50<br>
wt.% in general, with 0.5 to 30 wt.% being preferred,<br>
although it varies depending on the pigment. The vis-<br>
cosity of the ink may range generally from 1 to 50<br>
mPa.s, preferably from 2 to 30 mPa.s. Depending on<br>
the construction of the writing instrument, a viscosity<br>
lower than 7 mPa.s may be required in some instances.<br>
It is particularly important for an ink to be equipped<br>
with excellent stability in viscosity along the passage<br>
of time. Owing to the use of the above-described dis-<br>
persant and resin along with a pigment, the ink accord-<br>
ing to the present invention has been imparted with ex-<br>
cellent time-dependent stability in viscosity.<br>
A variety of additives can also be added to the<br>
ink of the present invention. Illustrative of such ad-<br>
ditives are fastness improvers such as ultraviolet ab-<br>
sorbers and antioxidants; anti-settling agents; release<br>
agents and releasability improvers; perfumes and<br>
antimicrobial agents; plasticizers; and drying in-<br>
hibitors. If necessary, one or more dyes can be added<br>
further. As a resin, a resin which has compatibility<br>
with the resin for use in the present invention may<br>
also be used in combination to an extent not lowering<br>
the dispersion stability of the pigment.<br>
In general, the thus-obtained ink can be used as<br>
is. It is however preferable to process the ink fur-<br>
ther in a centrifugal separator or an ultracentrifugal<br>
separator or through a filter, because removal of<br>
coarse particles of the pigment, which may exist in a<br>
trace amount in some instances, makes it possible to<br>
heighten the reliability of the writing instrument or<br>
recording apparatus.<br>
The writing instrument according to the present<br>
invention can be obtained by filling the ink of this<br>
invention, which has been obtained as described above,<br>
in a casing equipped with a porous tip. No particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the casing insofar as it has a<br>
size and shape convenient for writing as in the case of<br>
a variety of conventional writing instruments fitted<br>
with porous tips. The material of the casing, includ-<br>
ing its cap, can be a metal, a plastic or a composite,<br>
material thereof insofar as it is practically free from<br>
solvent permeation.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the structure or<br>
material of the porous tip insofar as it allows the ink<br>
to move from the interior of the casing to the free end<br>
of the tip as writing proceeds. However, excellent<br>
writing characteristics, durability and solvent<br>
resistance are required. Usable examples of fibers of<br>
bundled fiber tips and felt tips can include synthetic<br>
fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, nylon,<br>
polyacrylonitrile and vinylon fibers; cellulose and<br>
cellulose-derived regenerated fibers; and natural<br>
fibers such as wool, silk and cotton. Usable examples<br>
of open-cell foamed plastic products can include rigid<br>
or flexible urethane resin foams, foams of acetalized<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, and foamed of regenerated fibers.<br>
Usable examples of ink-occluding members can include<br>
bundles fibers, felted fibers, knitted fibers, and<br>
open-cell foamed plastic products.<br>
In the above description, inks making use of the<br>
dispersants according to the present invention have<br>
been referred to as representative examples. The pres-<br>
ent invention is however not limited only to inks. For<br>
example, the dispersants according to the present in-<br>
vention are useful as dispersants for a variety of<br>
conventionally-known pigments, and are useful as dis-<br>
persants for various pigments employed as coloring mat-<br>
ters in diverse paints, printing inks, pigment printing<br>
agents, synthetic resins and the like.<br>

specifically by Examples and Comparative Examples, in<br>

Synthesis Example of Film-Forming Resin<br>
Charged in a polymerizer were 75 parts of<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 5 parts of a-methylstyrene,<br>
100 parts of methyl methacrylate, 75 parts of<br>
acryloyloxyethyl phthalate, 7 5 parts of lauryl<br>
methacrylate, 150 parts of diacetoneacrylamide, 15<br>
parts of azobisisobutyronitrile, 550 parts of ethanol,<br>
150 parts of methylcyclohexane and 50 parts of ethyl<br>
acetate. A cooling coil was set, followed by<br>
polymerization at 75°C for 10 hours. After cooling,<br>
the resin solution was taken out of the polyraerizer.<br>
It was provided as a resin solution. The resin content<br>
was 40%, and the viscosity was 250 mPa.s. The number<br>
average molecular weight of the resin was 8,600 as<br>
measured by GPC and converted with reference to the<br>
corresponding data of standard polystyrene, and the<br>
acid value of the resin was 39.<br>
Example 17<br>
Dispersed in a horizontal disperser with tumbling<br>
medium contained therein were 250 parts of the above-<br>
described resin solution, 50 parts of benzidine yellow<br>
(P.Y. 83), 4 parts of Dispersant (1) of Example 1, 536<br>
parts of ethanol, 60 parts of methylcyclohexane and 100<br>
parts of ethoxypropanol. Coarse particles were then<br>
removed by ultracentrifugal separation, whereby an ink<br>
according to the present invention was obtained. The<br>
average particle size of the pigment was 95 nm, and the<br>
viscosity was 3.5 mPa.s. The ink was stored at 50°C<br>
for a week, but settling of the pigment was not ob-<br>
served. When its viscosity was measured, it was still<br>
3.5 mPa.s, thereby indicating no change in viscosity.<br>
The ink was next filled in a pen casing equipped<br>
with a bundled fiber tip, and a writing test was con-<br>
ducted on a polyethylene film. Smooth writing was fea-<br>
sible. Further, 20 parts of ethoxypropanol and 5 parts<br>
of benzyl alcohol were added further to 100 parts of<br>
the ink. Using the thus-obtained ink, printing was<br>
performed by an ink-jet printer. Good printed matter<br>
was obtained.<br>
Examples 18-24<br>
Yellow inks were obtained in a similar manner as<br>
in Example 17 except that the dispersants of Examples<br>

low inks were then ranked as in Example 17. The<br>
results are presented in Table 1 together with the<br>
results of Example 17. In the table, "A" indicates<br>
good in both writing characteristics and ink-jet<br>
printability, while "B" indicates insufficient writing<br>
characteristics or insufficient ink-jet printability.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>

also presented in Table 1.<br>
Example 25<br>
Ten (10) parts of Dispersant 2 were dissolved in<br>
100 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of a red pigment (P.R. 254; pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
to 8.5. After the mixture was stirred for further 30<br>
minutes, the resulting solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground,<br>
whereby 108 parts of red pigment powder surface-treated<br>
with the dispersant were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained surface-treated pigment was<br>
dispersed to a pigment content of 15% in a commercial<br>
melamine/alkyd paint by a ball mill. The colored paint<br>
so obtained had low viscosity, and showed fluidity sub-<br>
stantially close to a Newtonian flow. Further, the red<br>
paint was mixed with a commercial white melamine/alkyd<br>
paint to formulate a pale red paint. Even after stored<br>
for a week, the pale red paint was still in a homo-<br>
geneous form without any color separation.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 25 except that the red pigment (P.R. 2 54) was<br>
used without surface treatment with Dispersant 2. The<br>
paint was ranked as in Example 25. The paint had high<br>
viscosity, and in the form of a mixed paint with a<br>
white paint, the red pigment underwent separation and<br>
settling through coagulation.<br>
Example 26<br>
Eight (8) parts of Dispersant 3 were dissolved in<br>
100 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of a red pigment (P.R. 254; pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
to 8.5. After the mixture was stirred for further 30<br>
minutes, the resulting solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground,<br>
whereby 105 parts of red pigment powder surface-treated<br>
with the dispersant were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained pigment composition was dis-<br>
persed in a commercial acrylic lacquer by a beads mill,<br>
whereby a red paint having a pigment content of 13% was<br>
formulated. The paint was adjusted in viscosity with a<br>
lacquer thinner and was spray-painted on an iron plate.<br>
A plate coated in a red color and having a dry film<br>
thickness of 32 µm was obtained. It was excellent in<br>
vividness, and showed a high degree of gloss.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 26 except that the red pigment (P.R. 254) was<br>
used without surface treatment with Dispersant 3. The<br>
viscosity was adjusted likewise, and the paint was<br>
ranked as in Example 26. The surface of a coating on a<br>
plate coated in a red color was not smooth, and its<br>
gloss was low.<br>
Example 27<br>
Dispersed in a horizontal disperser with tumbling<br>
medium contained therein were 250 parts of the resin<br>
solution prepared in the Synthesis Example of the film-<br>
forming resin, 50 parts of cyanine blue (P.B. 15-2), 4<br>
parts of Dispersant (9) of Example 9, 536 parts of<br>
ethanol, 60 parts of methylcyclohexane and 100 parts of<br>
ethoxypropanol. Coarse particles were then removed by<br>
ultracentrifugal separation, whereby an ink according<br>
to the present invention was obtained. The average<br>
particle size of the pigment was 95 nm, and the vis-<br>
cosity was 3.8 mPa.s. The ink was stored at 50°C for a<br>
week, but settling of the pigment was not observed.<br>
When its viscosity was measured, it was still 3.8<br>
mPa.s and accordingly, no change took place in vis-<br>
cosity .<br>
The ink was next filled in a pen casing equipped<br>
with a bundled fiber tip, and a writing test was con-<br>
ducted on a polyethylene film. Smooth writing was fea-<br>

of benzyl alcohol were added further to 100 parts of<br>
the ink. Using the thus-obtained ink, printing was<br>
performed by an ink-jet printer. Good printed matter<br>
was obtained.<br>
Examples 28-34<br>
Blue inks were obtained in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 2 7 except that the dispersants of Examples 10-<br>
16 were used as dispersants, respectively. Those blue<br>
inks were then ranked as in Example 27. The results<br>
are presented in Table 2 together with the results of<br>
Example 27. In the table, "A" indicates good in both<br>

white paint, the red pigment underwent separation and<br>
settling through coagulation.<br>
Example 36<br>
Eight (8) parts of Dispersant 11 were dissolved<br>

Comparative Example 6<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>

Example 37<br>
Dispersed in a horizontal disperser with tumbling<br>
medium contained therein were 2 50 parts of the resin<br>
solution prepared in the Synthesis Example of the film-<br>
forming resin, 750 parts of c.I. pigment black, 4 parts<br>
of Dispersant (1) of Example 1, 536 parts of ethanol,<br>
60 parts of methylcyclohexane and 100 parts of ethoxy-<br>
propanol. Coarse particles were then removed by<br>
ultracentrifugal separation, whereby a black ink ac-<br>
cording to the present invention was obtained. The<br>
average particle size of the CB pigment was 95 nra, and<br>
the viscosity was 3.5 mPa.s. The black ink was stored<br>
at 50°C for a week, but settling of the CB pigment was<br>
not observed. When its viscosity was measured, it was<br>
still 3.5 mPa.s and accordingly, no change took place<br>
in viscosity.<br>
The black ink was next filled in a pen casing<br>
equipped with a bundled fiber tip, and a writing test<br>
was conducted on a polyethylene film. Smooth writing<br>
was feasible. Further, 20 parts of ethoxypropanol and<br>
5 parts of benzyl alcohol were added further to 100<br>
parts of the black ink. Using the thus-obtained black<br>
ink, printing was performed by an ink-jet printer.<br>
Good printed matter was obtained.<br>
Examples 38-44<br>
Black inks were obtained in a similar manner as<br>
in Example 3 7 except that the dispersants of Examples<br>
2-8 were used as dispersants, respectively. Those<br>
black inks were then ranked as in Example 37. The<br>
results are presented in Table 3 together with the<br>
results of Example 37. In the table, "A" indicates<br>
good in both writing characteristics and ink-jet<br>
printability, while "B" indicates insufficient writing<br>
characteristics or insufficient ink-jet printability.<br>
Comparative Example 7<br>
A black ink was obtained in a similar manner as<br>
in Example 37 except that the dispersant was not used.<br>
The ink was ranked as in Example 37. The results are<br>
also presented in Table 3.<br>
Example 45<br>
Ten (10) parts of Dispersant 2 were dissolved in<br>
200 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of C.I. pigment black 7 (CB pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
to 8.5. After the mixture was stirred for further 30<br>
minutes, the resulting solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground,<br>
whereby 108 parts of black pigment powder surface-<br>
treated with the dispersant were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained surface-treated CB pigment was<br>
dispersed to a CB pigment content of 15% in a commer-<br>
cial melamine/alkyd paint by a ball mill. The colored<br>
paint so obtained had low viscosity, and showed<br>
fluidity substantially close to a Newtonian flow. Fur-<br>
ther, the black paint was mixed with a commercial white<br>
melamine/alkyd paint to formulate a gray paint. Even<br>
after stored for a week, the gray paint was still in a<br>
homogeneous form without any color separation.<br>
Comparative Example 8<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 45 except that the same CB pigment was used<br>
without surface treatment with Dispersant 2. The paint<br>
was ranked as in Example 45. The paint had high vis-<br>
cosity, and in the form of a mixed paint with a white<br>
paint, the CB pigment underwent separation and settling<br>
through coagulation.<br>
Example 46<br>
Eight (8) parts of Dispersant 3 were dissolved in<br>
100 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of C.I. pigment black 7 (CB pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
to 8.5. After the mixture was stirred for further 30<br>
minutes, the resulting solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground,<br>
whereby 105 parts of black pigment powder surface-<br>
treated with the dispersant were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained surface-treated CB pigment was<br>
dispersed in a commercial acrylic lacquer by a beads<br>
mill, whereby a black paint having a CB pigment content<br>
of 13% was formulated. The paint was adjusted in vis-<br>
cosity with a lacquer thinner and was spray-painted on<br>
an iron plate. A plate coated in a black color and<br>
having a dry film thickness of 32 µm was obtained. It<br>
was excellent in vividness, and showed a high degree of<br>
gloss.<br>
Comparative Example 9<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 46 except that the same CB pigment was used<br>
without surface treatment with Dispersant 3. The vis-<br>
cosity was adjusted likewise, and the paint was ranked<br>
as in Example 46. The surface of a coating on a plate<br>
coated in a black color was not smooth, and its gloss<br>
was low.<br>
Example 4 7<br>
Dispersed in a horizontal disperser with tumbling<br>
medium contained therein were 250 parts of the resin<br>
solution prepared in the Synthesis Example of the film-<br>
forming resin, 750 parts of C.I. pigment black, 4 parts<br>
of Dispersant (9) of Example 9, 536 parts of ethanol,<br>
60 parts of methylcyclohexane and 100 parts of ethoxy-<br>
propanol. Coarse particles were then removed by<br>
ultracentrifugal separation, whereby a black ink ac-<br>
cording to the present invention was obtained. The<br>
average particle size of the CB pigment was 95 nm, and<br>
the viscosity was 3.5 mPa.s. The black ink was stored<br>
at 50°C for a week, but settling of the CB pigment was<br>
not observed. When its viscosity was measured, it was<br>
still 3.5 mPa.s and accordingly, no change took place<br>
in viscosity.<br>
The black ink was next filled in a pen casing<br>
equipped with a bundled fiber tip, and a writing test<br>
was conducted on a polyethylene film. Smooth writing<br>
was feasible. Further, 20 parts of ethoxypropanol and<br>
5 parts of benzyl alcohol were added further to 100<br>
parts of the black ink. Using the thus-obtained black<br>
ink, printing was performed by an ink-jet printer.<br>
Good printed matter was obtained.<br>
Examples 48-54<br>
Black inks were obtained in a similar manner as<br>
in Example 4 7 except that the dispersants of Examples<br>
10-16 were used as dispersants, respectively. Those<br>
black inks were then ranked as in Example 47. The<br>
results are presented in Table 4 together with the<br>
results of Example 47. In the table, "A" indicates<br>
good in both writing characteristics and ink-jet<br>
printability, while "B" indicates insufficient writing<br>
characteristics or insufficient ink-jet printability.<br>
Example 55<br>
Ten (10) parts of Dispersant 10 were dissolved in<br>
200 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of C.I. pigment black 7 (CB pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
to 8.5. After the mixture was stirred for further 3 0<br>
minutes, the resulting solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground,<br>
whereby 108 parts of black pigment powder surface-<br>
treated with the dispersant were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained surface-treated CB pigment was<br>
«<br>
dispersed to a CB pigment content of 15% in a commer-<br>
cial melamine/alkyd paint by a ball mill. The colored<br>
paint so obtained had low viscosity, and showed<br>
fluidity substantially close to a Newtonian flow. Fur-<br>

homogeneous form without any color separation.<br>
Comparative Example 11<br>
A paint was formulated in a similar manner as in<br>
Example 55 except that the same CB pigment was used<br>
without surface treatment with Dispersant 10. The<br>
paint was ranked as in Example 55. The paint had high<br>
viscosity, and in the form of a mixed paint with a<br>
white paint, the CB pigment underwent separation and<br>
settling through coagulation.<br>
Example 56<br>
Eight (8) parts of Dispersant 11 were dissolved<br>
in 100 parts of an aqueous solution which contained 5<br>
parts of glacial acetic acid. The resultant solution<br>
was added to a slurry of C.I. pigment black 7 (CB pig-<br>
ment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60<br>
minutes. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
was then gradually added to adjust the pH of the system<br>
