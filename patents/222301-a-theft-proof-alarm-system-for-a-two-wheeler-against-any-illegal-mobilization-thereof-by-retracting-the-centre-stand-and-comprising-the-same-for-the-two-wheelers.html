				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to "a theft proof alarm system for a two-wheeler against any illegal mobilisation thereof by retracting the centre-stand and comprising the same for the two-wheelers".<br>
In any known two-wheeler, there is a normal practice done by putting the centre-stand {with on-stand condition) for vehicle parking. The vehicle will be released from the on-stand position to the off-stand position by retracting the centre-stand for any mobilization. Even when the vehicle was steering locked against the theft-occurrence during parking, there is the possibility to mobilize any known vehicle by the thief or thieves by normally retracting or relieving the centre-stand from the ground and then lifting any one of the wheels. The mobilization of any known vehicle is possible only after retracting the centre-stand of the locked vehicle. It has not been absolutely possible so far to prevent this kind of theft or the possibility thereof, even in the vehicle with steering locked condition.<br>
According to this invention, a theft proof alarm system for a two-wheeler against any illegal mobilisation thereof by retracting the centre-stand and comprising the same for the two-wheelers, comprises a limit-switch provided, spring-loaded and rigidly connected to the centre-stand-bracket as a part of the vehicle, said switch is operatively connected between an electric-power source and a theft alarm system wherein said limit-switch is loaded by said centre-stand by means of switch-off condition at on-stand position, against the said spring which is provided in said limit-switch to normally release the said limit-switch for switch-on condition so as to close the electric-power circuit to operate the theft alarm system as a caution against the theft occurrence, only when the said centre-stand was retracted to off-stand position for the purpose of any illegal mobilization as the theft, there is also a manual switch integrally provided with â€¢&amp;&gt; known  ignition switch with one more theft-lock mode and operatively connected between said electric-power source and said theft alarm system in series with said limit switch so as to switch-on or to activate the said alarm   system   only   when   the   centre-stand   was   retracted   for   any<br><br>
mobilization as the theft and only after the rider switched the said manual switch with theft-lock-on condition after ignition-off or with steering-locking by the ignition key.<br>
The invention will now be apparent from the following non-limitative description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
FIGURES 1 and 2     respectively show pictorial and orthographic<br>
views of an arrangement comprising a limit-switch connected to centre-stand-bracket and its mounting bracket as a part of a two-wheeler during on-stand condition of the centre-stand according to this invention;<br>
FIGURES 3 and 4     respectively show pictorial and orthographic<br>
views of the above said arrangement during off-stand condition of the said centre-stand;<br>
FIGURE 5	shows    schematic    circuit   diagram   of   the<br>
arrangement of said limit-switch connected to the centre-stand, theft alarm system, electric-power source and theft-locking switch;<br>
Referring to FIGURES 1 to 4, according to this invention, there is provided a limit-switch 1, which is spring-loaded and rigidly connected to the centre stand-bracket 2 as a part of the vehicle. The said switch 1 is also operatively connected between an electric-power source 4 and a theft alarm system 5 through electrical cables 5A as shown in Figure 5A. The said limit-switch 1 is kept in switch-off condition by means of the centre-stand 3 pressing over the said switch 1 during its on-stand position as shown in Figures 1 and 2. There is normally provided a return-spring in said limit switch (not shown in figure), which is to normally release the said limit-switch 1 for switch-on condition during its off-stand position as shown in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
There is also a manual switch 6 integrally provided with any known type of ignition switch 7 with one more lock mode named by theft-lock mode 6A<br><br>
along with hand-lock. The said manual switch 6 is operatively connected between said electric-power source 4 and said (heft alarm system 5 in series with said limit switch 1. The said limit switch 1 is capable of working or being activated to operate the said alarm system 5 during a theft-attempt, only after the rider switched-on the said manual switch 6 in theft-lock-mode 6A which is after ignition-off mode 6B or with steering-lock mode 6C by the ignition key while parking. When the centre-stand 3 is retracted for any illegal mobilization of the vehicle, the electric-circuit is closed which in turn operating the theft-alarm system 5 as a caution.<br>
Further the said theft-lock mode is also provided after ignition-off or steering-lock mode either in the ignition-lock system or in the steering-lock system respectively of separate ignition and steering locking systems type of vehicle.<br>
Still further the theft-lock mode is also provided in a separate control switch with a control key or with a lever-type knob. The said lever-type knob control is provided no key control and confidentially inside the utility box or storage container or any other interior place and die location of which is to particularly be known only by the customers.<br>
Normally the vehicle is put with centre-stand by the rider after switching-off the ignition,tor the parking purpose. According to this invention, it is then followed by using the said ignition-switch to switch-on theft locking with or after hand locking for taking out the key. So the theft-lock circuit will be closed for activating the limit-switch connected with centre-stand. After the rider moves away from there, and whenever this vehicle is perhaps made with any theft attempt by mobilizing the vehicle, it will be possible only after retracting the centre-stand of this vehicle, which has been with handle-locked. When the centre-stand is retracted to off-stand position from on-stand position, then the said<br><br>
limit-switch is made to release itself by its spring-load to close the theft-alarm circuit to activate the theft alarm system by the theft-warning or indication or caution of theft-attempt Then the theft-attempt or occurrence will simultaneously be identified to prevent the theft or capture the causes of the theft-occurrence (the persons who have attempted)<br>
Farther, after parking when the same rider desires to take the vehicle back, he should firat release the theft-lock mode using the ignition-key before retracting the centre-stand to mobilise the vehicle. Then it will obviously open the theft-lock circuit for its deactivation. Then even when the centre-stand is retracted to its off-stand condition only by the rider or for any legal usage, the theft-aiarm system will not do any function against the customer while in use.<br>
The terras and expressions used herein are illustrative and not limitative in any sense.<br><br><br>
