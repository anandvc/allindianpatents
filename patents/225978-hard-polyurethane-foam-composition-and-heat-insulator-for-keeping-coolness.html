				<td>HARD POLYURETHANE FOAM COMPOSITION AND INSULATOR FOR KEEPING<br>
COOLNESS USING IT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a hard polyurethane<br>
foam composition which can be prepared into an insulator in<br>
the presence of a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) foaming agent<br>
which is not harmful to the ozone layer, in addition to<br>
being superior in heat insulation and mechanical properties,<br>
and an insulator using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, hard urethane foam is prepared from<br>
diisocyanate and polyol in the presence of a foaming agent<br>
such as water, chlorofluorocarbon, hydrochlorofluorocarbon,<br>
hydrofluorocarbon, carbon dioxide, cyclopentane, etc.<br>
Widely used are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 4,4-<br>
diphenylmethanediisocyanate. Preferable is polymeric 4,4-<br>
diphenylmethanediisocyanate with an average functional group<br>
number of 2.7 or more.<br>
As for the polyol, it is of polyether or polyester.<br>
Polyetherpolyols are particularly widely used because they<br>
are easy to handle due to their low viscosity and stable to<br><br>
hydrolysis in addition to being inexpensive.<br>
Polyesterpolyols are superior in heat stability and tensile<br>
strength, but show low hydrolysis resistance. More than<br>
90 % of polyurethane products are prepared from<br>
polyetherpolyols, while polyetherpolyols are used for<br>
special uses.<br>
Physical properties of hard polyurethane foam can be<br>
expressed in a function of density. As the density of hard<br>
polyurethane foam decreases, the thermal conductivity<br>
becomes low, so that its adiabatic performance is improved.<br>
However, physical properties, such as compression strength,<br>
are deteriorated. Thus, it is very difficult to develop<br>
hard polyurethane foam superior in heat insulation and<br>
physical properties, but both of the properties are<br>
necessary to ultra-low temperature insulators or ultra-low<br>
temperature pipe covers for liquefied natural gas storage<br>
tanks and to heat insulators for general uses.<br>
In order to improve the physical properties of<br>
polyurethane foam, the density of polyurethane foam is<br>
increased or a filler, such as glass fiber or carbon fiber,<br>
is used. However, the increase in density and the use of<br>
filler both suffer from the disadvantages of increasing the<br>
thermal conductivity to lower the heat insulation.<br>
Where polyurethane foam is used as an untra low<br>
temperature insulators, a decrease in heat insulation bears<br><br>
highly negative results. Therefore, there is needed an<br>
improvement in physical properties without a decrease in<br>
heat insulation.<br>
Examples of the foaming agent useful for the<br>
preparation of polyurethane foam include water, carboxylic<br>
acids, fluorocarbon foaming agents, carboxylic acid, and air.<br>
Formerly, chlorofluorocarbon was widely used because<br>
of its low thermal conductivity and high stability in the<br>
air. However, as chlorofluorocarbon was found to harm the<br>
environment, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, cyclohexane, water,<br>
hydrochlorofluorocarbon, or hydrofluorocarbon has been<br>
recently used instead. Particularly regarded as the next<br>
generation foaming agent, hydrofluorocarbon has attracted a<br>
lot of attention because it does not harm the ozone layer,<br>
shows low thermal conductivity and does not diffuse from the<br>
polyurethane foam to the air so as to make the heat<br>
insulation performance to last long.<br>
As substitutes for CPC-11 and CFC-12, HFC-365mfc (1,3-<br>
pentafluorobutane) and HFC-245fa (1,3-pentachloropropane),<br>
found to be not harmful to the ozone layer, have been under<br>
study and used, in addition to HCFC-122 (2,2-dichloro-l,1,1-<br>
trifluoroethane), HCFC-141b (1,1-dichloro-l-fluoroethane),<br>
HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), and HFC-152a (1,1-<br>
difluoroethane).<br>
Besides foaming agents, various additives such as<br><br>
catalysts, flame retardants, chain extenders, etc. are used<br>
to prepare polyurethane foam.<br>
Exemplified by low molecular weight diol or diamine, a<br>
chain extender or a crosslinking agent is used with the aim<br>
of increasing the mechanical strength of polyurethane foam.<br>
Tins and amines are useful as catalysts.<br>
The low flame retardancy of polyurethane requires the<br>
use of flame retardants, which are usually halogen,<br>
phosphorus, and inorganic compounds, being grouped into<br>
reactive and additive types.<br>
When the cells formed during foaming are small and<br>
uniform, the resultant foam is improved in heat insulation<br>
and mechanical properties. To this end, silicon surfactants<br>
are used as cell stabilizers.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the background in mind, the intensive and<br>
thorough research into a heat insulator which is<br>
environmentally friendly as well as exhibiting superior<br>
mechanical and heat insulating properties, conducted by the<br>
present inventors, resulted in the finding that a mixture of<br>
three polyether polyols and one polyester polyol, each<br>
ranging in OH values, from 200 to 659, can be reacted with<br>
polymeric 4,4-dimethylmethanediisocyanate in the presence of<br><br>
an HFC lineage foaming agent which does not harm the ozone<br>
layer to give a foam with excellent mechanical and heat<br>
insulating properties.<br>

polyurethane foam composition, comprising a polymeric 4,4'-<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate; a polyol mixture comprising<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is an electron microscope photograph showing<br>
the micro structure of the hard polyurethane foam prepared<br>
by use of HFC-365mfc as a foaming agent in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, polyurethane foam is<br>
prepared from 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and a<br>
mixture of polyols in the presence of a foaming agent.<br>
The polyol mixture useful in the present invention<br>
comprises (a) 20-60 wt% of polyetherpolyol, polymerized by<br>
the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to<br>
sorbitol, (b) 10-40 wt% of polyetherpolyol, polymerized by<br>
addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to<br><br>
pentaerythritol, (c) 10-20 wt% of polyetherpolyol,<br>
polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene<br>
oxide to sucrose, (d) 10-20 wt% of polyesterpolyol,<br>
polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene<br>
oxide to phthalic anhydride, and (e) 1-20 wt% of<br>
polyetherpolyol, polymerized by the addition of ethylene<br>
oxide and propylene oxide to brome-substituted glycerine.<br>
The polyol mixture ranges from 380 to 510, in average OH<br>
values.<br>
Preferably, the NCO/OH ratio of the composition<br>
comprising polymeric 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and<br>
the polyol mixture is in the range of 1.0-2.0.<br>
As described, the polyols used in the present<br>
invention are synthesized from glycerine, pentaerythritol,<br>
sorbitol, and sucrose. Because these alcohols have three,<br>
four, six and eight functional groups, respectively, which<br>
are reactive to the diisocyanate, linear or crosslinking<br>
linkages are formed upon reaction between the reactants.<br>
According to the alcohol bases used, large differences are<br>
found in the resultant polyurethane foams. For example, the<br>
difference in compression strength between the polyurethane<br>
foams based on glycerine and sorbitol is 10 % or upward. In<br>
the present invention, the content of each polyol is<br>
optimized in sufficient consideration of the reaction time,<br>
viscosity and physical properties of the products. The use<br><br>
of brome-substituted polyol resides with an improvement in<br>
flame retardancy. As for a heat insulator with a low<br>
density, it is poor in flame retardancy. Thus, the brome-<br>
substituted polyol contributes to the improvement of flame<br>
retardancy.<br>
In addition to the diisocyanate and the polyols, the<br>
polyurethane foam composition of the present invention<br>
comprises a foaming agent, a catalyst, and other additives.<br>
A useful foaming agent is selected from among HFC-<br>
365mfc (1,3-pentafluorobutane) and HFC-245fa (1,3-<br>
pentafluoropropane). HFC-365mfc and HFC245fa may be used in<br>
combination without, deteriorating the physical properties of<br>
the polyurethane foam. Therefore, HFC-245fa may be mixed in<br>
the proportions of 0-100% with HFC-365mfc. Water, if<br>
necessary, may be used as a subsidiary foaming agent. It is<br>
preferred that the organic foaming agent is used in the<br>
amount of 3-35 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight<br>
of the polyols used. Water is preferably added in the<br>
amount of 0-7 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight<br>
of the polyols used. In this case, the polyurethane foam<br>
obtained has a density of 30-140 kg/m3. The density can be<br>
adjusted to be below 30 kg/m3 or over 14 0 kg/m3 by<br>
controlling the amount of the foaming agent.<br>
Low evaporation temperatures of HFC-365mfc and HFC-<br>
245fa make it easy to prepare polyurethane foam.<br><br>
Additionally, their low thermal conductivity contributes to<br>
the formation of high heat insulating properties in<br>
polyurethane foam.<br>
Water, used as a subsidiary foaming agent, reacts with<br>
diisocyanate to form urea and discharge carbon dioxide which<br>
is then utilized in the bubbling of the polyurethane foam.<br>
In addition, the reaction heat produced upon reaction<br>
between water and diisocyanate is used for the evaporation<br>
of HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa. If the amount of water is over<br>
7 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the<br>
polyols used, not only is excessive heat generated by the<br>
reaction to scorch in the polyurethane foam obtained, but<br>
also excess carbon dioxide is present in the polyurethane<br>
foam, giving rise to an increase in thermal conductivity.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, hard<br>
polyurethane foam is prepared from the diisocyanate and the<br>
polyol mixture in the presence of a catalyst with the aid of<br>
a foaming agent, a bubble stabilizer and other additives.<br>
Useful to promote the reaction of the diisocyanate<br>
with the polyols are amine catalysts. In accordance with<br>
the present invention, the catalyst is selected from the<br>
group consisting of pentamethyldiethylene triamine,<br>
dimethylcycloamine,	tris(3-<br>
dimethylamino)propylhexahydrotriamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The catalyst is preferably used in the amount of 0.1-2.0<br><br>
parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol<br>
mixture used. For example, when too little of a catalyst is<br>
used, the reaction rate becomes so slow as to produce<br>
incomplete hard polyurethane foam which is poor in physical<br>
properties. On the other hand, if the amount of the<br>
catalyst exceeds 2.0 parts by weight, the reaction rate and<br>
physical properties are not improved to the same degree.<br>
The silicon surfactant polysiloxane ether is useful as<br>
a bubble stabilizer in the present invention. The foaming<br>
agent is vaporized by the heat generated during the reaction<br>
between diisocyanate and polyol, forming bubbles to foam the<br>
polyurethane reactants. When the bubbles gather together<br>
into larger ones due to their internal pressures, the<br>
polyurethane foam has poor heat insulating properties and<br>
weak mechanical strength. The silicon surfactant provides<br>
charges on the surface of the bubbles so that the bubbles<br>
become repulsive to each other by the electrostaticity. As<br>
a result, the polyurethane foam retains small and uniform<br>
cells. Preferably, the amount of the bubble stabilizer<br>
falls into the range of 0-2.0 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyols used. If the bubble<br>
stabilizer is used in an amount larger than 2.0 parts by<br>
weight, the polyurethane foam becomes poor in compression<br>
strength and load resistance.<br>
To provide the polyurethane foam with flame retardancy,<br><br>
a flame retardant may be added. Useful are phosphorus flame<br>
retardants, exemplified by tricresyl phosphate. The amount<br>
of the flame retardant preferably ranges from 5 to 15 parts<br>
by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyols used.<br>
For example, if the flame retardant is used in an amount<br>
smaller than 5 parts by weight, satisfactory flame<br>
retardancy is not obtained. On the other hand, if the<br>
amount of the flame retardant is over 15 parts by weight,<br>
there is only a slight increase in flame retardancy obtained<br>
and the productivity becomes low.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a<br>
crosslinking agent may be used to reinforce the strength of<br>
the polyurethane foam, as well as shortening the curing time.<br>
Optionally, other additives which are used in urethane<br>
chemistry, such as fillers, stabilizers, e.g., anti-oxidants<br>
and UV light absorbers, and colorants, etc. may be added.<br>
The polyurethane foam may be prepared in various<br>
methods, such as a one-shot method, a prepolymer method, etc.<br>
According to the one-shot method, all reactants including<br>
isocyanate and polyol are simultaneously fed to a reaction<br>
tank. The one-shot method is simple and easy, but suffers<br>
from the disadvantage of finding difficulty in controlling<br>
reaction rates and producing a large quantity of reaction<br>
heat to cause cracks in the foam. On the other hand,<br>
isocyanate is partially reacted with polyol in advance and<br><br>
the remaining reactants are added to the prepolymers<br>
synthesized according to the prepolymer method. This method<br>
enjoys the advantage of showing high reaction rates as the<br>
reactants relatively slowly reacted and of allowing the foam<br>
to fill every nook and corner of complicate structures as<br>
the viscosity of the foam is slowly increased. However, the<br>
prepolymer method is disadvantageous in that the production<br>
procedure is so lengthy as to increase the production cost.<br>
In the present invention, the one-shot method is adopted in<br>
consideration of productivity, workability, and production<br>
cost. However, the addition of polyols and additives are<br>
under control lest scorch and cracks attributed to a large<br>
reaction heat are caused.<br>
High or low pressure foaming machines as usually used<br>
in the polyurethane industry may be used.<br>
A better understanding of the present invention may be<br>
obtained in light of the following examples which are set<br>
forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed to limit<br>
the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To a polyol mixture comprising 35.0 g of the polyol<br>
polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene<br><br>
oxide to pentaerythritol, 25.0 g of the polyol polymerized<br>
by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to<br>
sucrose, 10.0 g of the polyol polymerized by the addition of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to phthalic anhydride,<br>
30.0 g of the polyol polymerized by the addition of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to sorbitol, and 30.0 g<br>
of the polyol polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide<br>
and ethylene oxide to glycerine, 2.0 g of polysiloxane ether,<br>
a catalyst mixture comprising 0.3 g of<br>
pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, 0.8 g of dimethylcycloamine,<br>
and 0.3 g of tris(3-dimethylamino)propylhexahydrotriamine, a<br>
flame-retardant mixture comprising 10.0 g of tricresyl<br>
phosphate and 0.4 g of water, and 8.0 g of HFC-365mfc were<br>
added to form a resin solution. 140.0 g of 4,4-<br>
dimethylmethanediisocyanate was mixed with the resin<br>
solution to prepare polyurethane foam.<br>
The polyurethane foam was measured for physical<br>
properties and the results and test methods are given in<br>
Table 1, below.<br><br><br><br>
The closed cell content has an influence on the<br>
thermal conductivity, vapor transmittance, and water<br>
absorption. Accordingly, the closed cell content may be<br>
used as a barometer for controlling the quality of<br>
polyurethane foam. The polyurethane foam of this example is<br>
found to be high in the closed cell content as compared with<br>
the usual polyurethane foam which has a closed cell content<br>
of 90 %.<br>
The microstructure of the polyurethane foam prepared<br>
in the example was observed with the aid of an electron<br>
microscope. The foam is based on the cells produced by the<br>
bubbling of the polymer. As seen in Fig. 1, the<br>
polyurethane foam of the present invention contains small<br>
and uniform cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
To a polyol mixture comprising 25.0 g of the polyol<br>
polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene<br><br>
oxide to pentaerythritol, 45.0 g of the polyol polymerized<br>
by the addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to<br>
sucrose, 13.0 g of the polyol polymerized by the addition of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to glycerine, 14.0 g of<br>
the polyol polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide<br>
and ethylene oxide to phthalic anhydride, and 4 g of the<br>
polyol polymerized by the addition of propylene oxide and<br>
ethylene oxide to brome-substituted glycerine, 2.0 g of<br>
polysiloxane ether, a catalyst mixture comprising 0.4 g of<br>
pentamethyldiethylenetriamine and 0.8 g of<br>
dimethylcyclohexylamine, a flame-retardant mixture<br>
comprising 3.0 g of tricresyl phosphate and 1.1 g of water,<br>
and 26.5 g of HFC-365mfc were added to form a resin solution.<br>
160.0 g of 4,4-dimethylmethanediisocyanate was mixed with<br>
the resin solution to prepare a hard polyurethane foam.<br>
The polyurethane foam was measured for physical<br>
properties and the results and test methods are given in<br>
Table 2, below.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Hard polyurethane foam was prepared in a manner<br>
similar to that of Example 2, except that 22.0 g of HFC-<br>
245fa was used instead of HFC-365mfc. After its surface was<br>
removed, the hard polyurethane foam was measured for<br>
physical properties, and the results are given in Table 3,<br>
below.<br><br><br><br>
In the presence of hydrofluorocarbon compounds which<br>
are not harmful to the ozone layer, as described<br>
hereinbefore, hard polyurethane foam is obtained which is<br>
superior in mechanical strength while retaining excellent<br>
heat insulating properties. Therefore, using the<br>
polyurethane foam composition of the present invention, an<br>
environmentally friendly heat insulator which exhibits heat<br>
insulation and mechanical properties can be prepared in a<br>
conventional method.<br>
The present invention has been described in an<br>
illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the<br>
terminology used is intended to be in the nature of<br>
description rather than of limitation. Many modifications<br>
and variations of the present invention are possible in<br>
light of the above teachings. Therefore, it is to be<br>
understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically<br>
described.<br><br>
