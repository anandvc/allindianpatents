				<td>Means for obtaining avirulent leishmania promastigotes, promastigotes obtained and the applications thereof<br>
The invention relates to means for obtaining avirulent leishmania promastigotes. It also relates to the promastigotes obtained and to the uses thereof, in particular in immunoprophylaxis.<br>
Leishmaniases constitute worldwide endemic parasitic infections which represent a considerable public health problem affecting both developing countries and countries such as those of southern Europe, where they are considered to be opportunistic diseases in immune-depressed individuals.<br>
At the current time, no effective immunoprophylactic or immunotherapeutic means exist against leishmaniases, and more particularly against the responsible infectious agent, namely leishmania parasites.<br>
Leishmania parasites are flagellate protozoa belonging to the Trypanosomatldae family and to the Leishmania genus. This family includes parasites which can infect humans, and certain animals such as rodents, canines, or mammals.<br>
The biological cycle of protozoa of the Leishmania genus is shared between an invertebrate vector host, the sandfly (small hematophagous dipterous insect) , and many vertebrates, including humans. The leishmania have a heteroxenous parasitic developmental cycle during which two distinct morphological stages follow on from one another. In the sandfly, the parasite is in a mobile, extracellular, flagellate form inside the digestive tube of the insect, called promastigote stage. In the invertebrate host, the parasite transforms into an immobile ovoid form of from 2 to 6 Î¼m in diameter, with a very short flagellar residue, called amastigote, which will reside in the<br><br>
parasitophorous vacuole, in the cells of the reticulohistiocytic system, mainly macrophages.<br>
The female hematophagous vector insect becomes infected via the blood of the contaminated vertebrate host, by ingestion of parasitized macrophages. Most of the ingested amastigotes are then destroyed in the following hours. The survivors transform into promastigotes, which will colonize the median intestine, where they actively multiply. They subsequently migrate to the anterior and buccal parts of the digestive tract and then undergo differentiation leading to the formation of metacyclic promastigotes which are highly infectious for the vertebrate host.<br>
The vertebrate host is contaminated with the metacyclic promastigotes when it is bitten by an infected female sandfly. These promastigote forms are injected into the dermis together with saliva, and will then be phagocytized by the cells of the reticulohystiocytic system, in particular macrophages, inside which they differentiate into immobile intracellular amastigote forms. They will then actively multiply by schizogenesis inside the parasitophorous vacuole (phagolysosome) until lysis of the host cell is brought about, thus allowing the released amastigotes to propagate the infection by colonizing other normal macrophages. A further bite by a sandfly will result in infection of the latter and will allow the parasite to perpetuate its cycle.<br>
Despite the advances in this field, leishmaniases still remain today a serious public health problem due to the number of individuals involved, the extent of the geographic area covered by the disease, and the diversity and seriousness of the clinical pictures observed.<br>
The need for effective vaccines against leishmaniases and for novel therapeutic and/or vaccine-related targets for treating these parasitic diseases can therefore be seen.<br>
During infection, the infectious promastigote forms injected into the mammalian host must evade the host's immune response in order to be able to subsequently invade the macrophages. The parasite must therefore implement mechanisms which allow it to escape this immune response and to be capable of adapting to a new environment. Early recognition of the parasite by the host organism during invasion may thus be a key step in resistance to the infection.<br>
Surface antigens, lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and gp63 (metalloprotease) , also called leishmanolysin, were discovered in the 1980s.<br>
LPG is the major surface molecule of the promastigote forms, the role of which as a virulence factor has been confirmed.<br>
gp63 is a major surface protease, also considered to be a virulence factor.<br>
Antigens of a third type, called PSAs for "Promastigote Surface Antigens", were discovered in 1988-1989. They constitute the major surface antigens of the promastigote forms.<br>
Excretory/secretory antigens (ESAs), which have been very widely studied in many parasitic microorganisms (nematodes, protozoa, etc.), play an important role in the infection and defense mechanisms of these parasites, since they have the possibility of acting remotely. In leishmania, research studies have for a long time been limited by the difficulty in being able<br>
to have ESAs available in sufficient amounts to study them.<br>
All these antigens appear to play a determining role in the survival and infectiousness of the promastigote forms.<br>
Prior studies by the inventor in this field had led to the development of completely defined culture media, without macromolecules and free of fetal calf serum, allowing the continuous culture of the promastigote and amastigote forms under axenic and serum-free conditions. These media, described in particular in patent application FR No. 93 05 779, have made it possible to reproduce, in vitro, the complete parasitic developmental cycle . of leishmania, such as L. amazonensis and L. infantum, and to have, under natural conditions, a relatively abundant source of ESAs available by simply concentrating the culture medium supernatant metabolized by the parasites. A characterization of leishmania ESAs could thus be carried out.<br>
Studies performed in the inventors' laboratory have thus shown that the major immunogen of the L. amazonensis ESAs has a molecular mass of 45 kDa. The screening of a promastigote-form cDNA expression library with a monoclonal antibody called E2, produced against this major immunogen, has made it possible to isolate and identify cDNA clones encoding proteins of the PSA family. This antibody is produced by the murine hybridoma IV D6/E2 deposited with the C.N.C.M, 28 rue du Dr Roux, Paris, France, on November 10, 2004, under the No. 1-3318, more especially by the murine hybridoma deposited on February 3, 2006, with the CNCM under the No. 1-3570. Thus, for the first time, three new PSA cDNA sequences expressed in the promastigote form of L. amazonensis were identified. These isolated cDNAs<br>
differ from one another by virtue of the number of LRRs (4, 6 or 7) . More recently, a screening of an L. infantum promastigote cosmid library has been carried out using, as radiolabeled probe, the DNA encoding L. amazonensis PSA. A new Leishmania gene, IJ11, has been identified, encoding an excreted/secreted protein of L. infantum, of molecular mass 56 kDa (LiPSA 50s), belonging to the PSA family.<br>
A functional study of the genes encoding PSAs, major immunogens of the excretory/secretory products of leishmania, was therefore undertaken using the tools provided by genomics. The experimental approach consisted in introducing, into the promastigotes of a leishmania, plasmid constructs capable of inducing a decrease in the level of production of the PSA in order to study the repercussions of these changes on the biology of the parasite and its virulence.<br>
It thus appeared that the nondirectional cloning, in an expression vector for the IJ11 gene encoding the LiPSA 50s protein, resulted, after selection, in plasmids being obtained which contain the insert in an antisense orientation (Ldi antisense), allowing the under-expression of the PSA in the modified L. infantum promastigotes.<br>
Advantageously, it was found that these results could be generalized both as regards the leishmania species and as regards the gene inserts encoding antigenic proteins that can be used.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to provide novel expression vector constructs for genes encoding antigenic leishmania promastigote proteins.<br>
The invention is also directed toward the use of these constructs for obtaining avirulent leishmania<br>
promastigote mutants.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the invention is directed toward the uses of these avirulent mutants for immunoprophylactic purposes.<br>
The expression vectors according to the invention are characterized in that they contain an insert, in an antisense orientation, of a gene encoding an antigenic leishmania promastigote peptide or protein.<br>
Advantageously, the cloning into expression vectors of said genes in an antisense orientation allows the peptide or the protein to be underexpressed in the modified leishmania promastigotes.<br>
Preferably, said vectors are characterized in that they contain a leishmania PSA gene insert.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, it is an L. amazonensis gene insert.<br>
The L. amazonensis PSA genes are more especially chosen from the group comprising SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 5.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, it is an L. infantum gene insert.<br>
The L. infantum genes are advantageously chosen from the group comprising SEQ ID No. 6.<br>
The invention is also directed toward genetically modified leishmania promastigotes, characterized in that they are avirulent mutants, transfected with a vector as defined above.<br>
The invention is also directed toward a method of obtaining avirulent forms of leishmania promastigotes,<br>
characterized in that it comprises:<br>
nondirectional  insertion,  into  an  expression<br>
vector,  of genes encoding antigenic leishmania<br>
peptides or proteins,<br>
selection of the constructs containing the inserts<br>
in an antisense orientation,<br>
transfection  of  leishmania  promastigote  forms<br>
using the selected constructs,<br>
biological cloning of the genetically transformed<br>
promastigotes by micromanipulation so as to obtain<br>
mutants  which  underexpress,  or  even which  no<br>
longer express,  the gene encoding an antigenic<br>
leishmania promastigote protein.<br>
The transfection of the promastigote forms is advantageously carried out by electroporation.<br>
Revelation of the peptide or of the protein by Western blotting makes it possible to estimate its level of production in the clones.<br>
The use of the above arrangements makes it possible to study the consequences of the underexpression of antigenic leishmania peptides or proteins on the behavior of the transformed promastigotes and to thus identify their biological role.<br>
To this effect, the various genetically modified parasites were cloned by micromanipulation (biological cloning) and characterized and compared at the molecular level (level of production of the antigenic protein, level of expression of the corresponding transcripts). The phenotypic characterization of the genetically modified and cloned promastigotes consisted in comparing the growth kinetics of these parasites and also their infectious capacity in vitro with respect to canine macrophages.<br>
The characterization of a parasitic virulence factor, such as PSA, makes it possible to develop novel strategies for interference with the infectious process for therapeutic and/or vaccine-related purposes.<br>
In particular, the invention makes it possible to obtain attenuated, or even avirulent, strains that can be used in animal and/or human vaccination.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention are given in the examples which follow with reference to figures 1 to 4, which represent, respectively,<br>
figures 1 and 2, the results of analysis by Western blotting of the PSA of total polypeptide extracts of a wild-type strain of Ldi Monl and of excretory/secretory antigens of culture super-natants of wild-type strains, of sense and anti-sense transformed parasitic parent strains and of clones thereof;<br>

MATERIALS AND METHODS I - In vitro cultures<br>
1 - Axenic cultures of L. infantum<br>
The wild-type strain of Leishmania infantum used in	the<br>
studies described hereinafter bears the WHO reference:<br>
MHOM/MA/67/ITMAP-263/clone2,    zymodeme   MON-1.	The<br>
transformed strains were obtained after cloning of	the<br>
IJ11 gene  (1404 bp),  encoding the L.  infantum	PSA<br>
(56 kDa) , in the sense or antisense position in	the<br>
expression  vector  pTEX,  and  then  transfection	by<br>
electroporation into the promastigote form of L. infantum. The Ldi IJ11 antisense, Ldi pTEX transformed parasites were selected in the presence of increasing concentrations of geneticin up to 50 Î¼g/ml. The presence of the plasmid and the orientation of the transgene (antisense) were verified by Southern blotting and the level of transcription of the transgene was verified by Northern blotting.<br>
The promastigote forms are cultured under axenic conditions in a completely defined culture medium containing no macromolecule as serum substitute (serum-free RPMI 199H medium, pH 7) , but also in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% of decomplemented fetal calf serum (20% serum RPMI medium, pH 7.2), and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and with streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml), The various transformed strains were cloned by the micromanipulation technique. A single parasite is sampled under a microscope using a fine glass needle and deposited on NNN medium (Novy, macNeal, Nicolle). The culturing of the parasites is carried out by successive subculturings in 20% RPMI medium. The genetically modified promastigote forms and the corresponding clones are maintained in continuous culture by weekly subculturings in serum-containing culture media or adapted in serum-free medium at 25Â°C in the presence of geneticin (50 Î¼g/ml). The parasite concentration is determined by flow cytometry (FacsCalibur, Beckton Dickinson). The parasites are conserved by cryofreezing of the organisms in culture in the presence of 3% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) at -180Â°C in liquid nitrogen.<br>
2 - Macrophage cultures<br>
PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) are isolated from whole blood of a normal dog by Ficoll gradient (Ficoll LymphoprepÂ®, density 1.077 Â± 0.001 g/ml; AbCys,<br>
France) and by centrifugation at 700 g for 20 min at ambient temperature. The cells are then washed 3 times in PBS (0.01M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2) without Ca2+/Mg2+ by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min at 4Â°C, before being resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml of streptomycin, and then cultured at 37Â°C.<br>
II  -  Harvesting  and preparation  of  the  parasite material<br>
1	- Harvesting of the parasite material<br>
The promastigote forms in the stationary growth phase (7 days) are harvested by centrifugation of the serum-free parasite cultures at 3000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The parasite pellets and the culture supernatants thus dissociated are then treated separately.<br>
2	- Preparation of parasite lysates<br>
The parasite pellet is washed twice in PBS under the centrifugation conditions described above. After the final wash, the number of parasites harvested is determined by flow cytometry. 109 washed parasites are resuspended in a hypotonic lysis solution: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, containing 1% of Triton X100 (Sigma). After incubation at 4Â°C for 20 min, centrifugation for 20 min at 4Â°C and at 2000 g makes it possible to separate the insoluble material (debris) from the supernatant (soluble molecules). This supernatant corresponds to a total polypeptide extract (TPE).<br>
3	-. Concentration of the excretory/secretory antigens<br>
(ESAs) from the culture supernatant metabolized by the<br>
parasites<br>
10 ml of supernatant metabolized by the parasites are filtered through a Millipore membrane (0.22 Î¼m) and then frozen in shells before being freeze-dried. The freeze-dried materials are taken up in 1 ml of milliQ water in order to be dialyzed for 48 h at 4Â°C so as to remove the salts. A second freeze-drying process makes it possible to concentrate the supernatant 200-fold.<br>
III - Biochemical analyses<br>
1	- Protein assay<br>
The assaying of the proteins is carried out using the Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer, at 595 nm, according to the Bradford method, using the Biorad reagent (Biorad Protein Assay Kit 11). A standard range, from 5 to 20 Î¼g/ml, is prepared from a standard bovine albumin solution (1 mg/ml BSA, Sigma).<br>
2	- SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel<br>
Electrophoresis) analysis<br>
The SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel analysis was carried out in a mini-gel electrophoresis tank (Biorad). The acrylamide percentages used are 5% for the stacking gel and 10% for the separating gel, thereby making it possible to separate proteins of 10 to 200 kDa. TPE protein concentrations are mixed (v/v) with sample buffer containing 4% SDS, 20% glycerol and 0.5% bromo-phenol blue in 0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8.<br>
The electrophoretic migration is carried out in a buffer (2.5 mM Tris/19.2 mM glycine, pH 8.3) containing 0.1% SDS under a constant voltage of 80V. The calibration of the gel is obtained by depositing 10 Î¼g of standard proteins of known molecular weights (Markl2 Wide Range Protein Standard/SeeBlueÂ® Plus2 Pre-Stained Standard, Novex).<br>
3 - Revelation of the proteins with silver nitrate<br>
After removal of the SDS by washing in the presence of acetic acid (10%) and ethanol (40%) for 1 h, the acetic acid is then itself removed by two rinses for 30 min in 50% ethanol. The gels are then incubated for 15 min in a staining mixture: 19.4% AgNO3 - 0.36% NaOH. After 5 washes in milliQ water, a revealing solution containing 0.02% formaldehyde in 1% citric acid (w/v) reveals the proteins on the gel. The revelation threshold for this staining method is 2 ng of protein equivalent.<br>
IV - Immunoanalyses<br>
1 - Western blotting<br>
After having been separated in an SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel, the proteins are blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Hybond-C Extra). The blotting is carried out under semi-dry conditions. The membranes are then saturated for one hour in a TBS-5% milk blocking solution. The membranes are incubated overnight at ambient temperature and with agitation, with the F5 monoclonal antibody directed against PSA and obtained in mice (MAB F5) , diluted to 1/50 in TBS. After 3 washes for 5 min in TBS, the bound antibodies are detected with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse immuno-globulin G secondary antibodies (Tebu) diluted to 1/500 in TBS and incubated for 45 min at ambient temperature with agitation. Next, 3 washes for 5 min in TBS are carried out before revealing the reaction with a solution containing 15 mg of 4-chloro-l-naphthol dissolved in 5 ml of methanol, to which are added 25 ml of TBS containing 15 Î¼l of 30% H202. The reaction is stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water.<br>
2 - Indirect immunofluorescence on parasites<br>
The parasites in the stationary phase of their culture (7 days) are fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, and then washed. Once fixed, the parasites are deposited on Teflon-coated wells (10 wells, 50 ml/well) and dried in the open air. Each well is then processed with the F5 monoclonal antibody (MAB F5) diluted in a (saturating) blocking solution (1% goat serum, 0.5% BSA in PBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. The cells are then washed and incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C with the second antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothio-cyanate (FITC) (goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G anti-serum) diluted to 1/300 in a solution of PBS containing Evans blue at 1/7500. The slides are observed under a photon fluorescence microscope (Leitz).<br>
V - Molecular analysis<br>
1 - Total RNA extraction<br>
The promastigote forms are harvested by centrifugation of the serum-free parasite cultures at 3000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The parasite pellet is washed twice in PBS under the above centrifugation conditions. After the final wash, in order to lyse the parasites and to inhibit the endogenous ribonucleases (RNAses), the cells are dissociated by vortexing in 1 ml of Trizol (Trizol Reagent, GibcoBRL), and then incubated for 5 min at ambient temperature. The lysate is incubated in 0.2 ml of chloroform for 2 min at ambient temperature, and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4Â°C so as to give two phases, an aqueous phase and an organic phase. The RNAs are exclusively in the aqueous phase, which is recovered. The RNAs are then precipitated by adding 0.5 ml of isopropanol and incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature, and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The pellet<br>
is washed in 1 ml of 75% ethanol, and then centrifuged at 7500 g for 5 min at 4Â°C, before being taken up in 40 Î¼l of water (RNAse-free) . In order to remove any possible presence of DNA, the dissolved RNA pellet is taken up in 1 Î¼l of DNAse I + 0.1 volume of 10X DNAse I buffer, and incubated for 20 min at 37Â°C. After the addition of 5 Î¼l of DNAse inactivation reagent, incubation for 2 min at ambient temperature and then centrifugation at 10 000 g for 1 min at 4Â°C, the supernatant containing the RNAs is recovered. The total RNA is quantified by spectrophotometry, the absorbance being read at 260 nm (1 OD unit = 40 Î¼g/ml of single-stranded RNA). The quality of the extracted RNA and the amount and the size are verified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in 0. 5X TAB buffer, in the presence of 0.01% ethidium bromide (ETB) . The size marker used is the SmartLadder (Eurogentec) . The total RNA is then visualized under UV at 312 nm after migration. The selected criteria for quality of the extraction are the absence of DNA and the visualization of 3 ribosomal RNA bands of equal intensity.<br>
2 - RT-PCR<br>
The single-stranded cDNA is synthesized by carrying out an RT-PCR with 1 Î¼g of total RNA, 2 Î¼l of dNTP mix (5 mM) , 0.2 Î¼l of specific primers (10 Î¼M) and H20 qs 13 Î¼l. The mix is incubated for 2 min at 65Â°C and then for 2 min in ice, before the following ar'e added: 4 Î¼l of 5X buffer, 1 Î¼l of DTT (0.1M), 1 Î¼l of Superase In (40U) (RNAse Inhibitor, Ambion) and 1 Î¼l of Superscriptâ¢ II (200U) (Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen) . The mix is incubated for 50 min at 42Â°C, and the reaction is then inactivated by heat shock for 15 min at 70Â°C.<br>
The single-stranded cDNA is amplified by PCR with 3 Î¼l of cDNA, 12.5 Î¼l of PCR Mastermix (Promega) , 1 Î¼l of<br>
5'P and 3'P specific primers (10 Î¼M) and H2O qs 25 Î¼l .<br>
The following primers were used:<br>
SEQ ID No. 7   - nhinspl: 5 ' -CATCGCTTACCCCTTGTT- 3 '<br>
SEQ ID No. 8   - nhinsp2: 5' -GTGGCCAATCGCGACA- 3 '<br>
SEQ ID No. 9   - P1RT:    5 ' ATGGCGCTGTGCGTGCGTCGG -3 '<br>
SEQ ID NO. 10  - P4RT:    5 ' GCGCGCGACAGCAGCGGCAT -3 ' .<br>
The program of the PCR reaction used and carried out in a thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR System 2400, Applied Biosystems) is the following: 5 min at 94Â°C, then 27 cycles (94Â°C 30 sec, 55Â°C 1 min, 72Â°C 1 min) and 10 min at 72Â°C.<br>
The PCR products are verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis .<br>
VI - Biological analysis<br>
1	- Growth kinetics<br>
The in vitro culture kinetics were realized over 10 days in RPMI 20% medium, starting from an initial concentration of 5 x 105 parasites/ml. The parasite concentration is determined by flow cytometry (FacsCalibur, Beckton Dickinson) , by mixing 500 Î¼l of PBS, 5 Î¼l of culture and 0.5 Î¼l of propidium iodide.<br>
2	- In vitro infection in parasite/macrophage inter<br>
actions<br>
106 PBMCs/well (200 Î¼l) , isolated from normal dog whole blood, are distributed in LabTekÂ® culture chambers (Nalge Nunc International) . After incubation for 30 min at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2, the LabTek" are washed gently with RPMI 10% in order to remove the cells which have not adhered. The macrophages are obtained from the cultured monocytes after 5 days of maturation. The mature<br>
macrophages are infected in vitro with promastigote forms in the stationary culture phase, for 30 min, 2 h and 48 h at 37Â°C and 5% C02 at a parasite:macrophage ratio of 10:1. The macrophages are then washed gently twice in order to remove the nonphagocytozed parasites. After 30 min, 2 h and 48 h, the cells are fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. 300 macrophages are observed under an immersion optical microscope (1000X magnification) , and the percentage of parasitized macrophages, the number of amastigotes per macrophage and the parasitic index (P.I.) are determined. The P.I. is equivalent to the percentage of infected macrophages multiplied by the number of amastigotes per macrophage.<br>
RESULTS<br>
- Evaluation of the level of production of PSA in the transformed clones<br>
Figures 1 and 2 report the results of Western blotting analysis of the PSA, respectively,<br>
of total polypeptide extracts (TPE) derived from the parasite pellets of the wild-type strain Ldi Monl,<br>
on excretory/secretory antigens (ESAs) derived from metabolized culture medium supernatants of the wild-type strain Ldi Monl, of the parent strains of transformed parasites (Ldi pTEX, Ldi IJ11 sense and Ldi IJ11 antisense) and of their corresponding clones (5 Î¼g protein equivalent of total extract per lane). It is noted that no band is observed for the wild-type strain Ldi Monl, that the overexpression is, on the other hand, clearly visible for Ldi IJ11 sense, both at the level of the TPEs and the ESAs, compared with the expression in Ldi pTEX, and that a decrease in the expression of the PSA is observed with Ldi IJ11 antisense.<br>
-	Analysis of the PSA transcripts by RT-PCR<br>
An RT-PCR was carried out on the transcripts of the gene encoding the PSA and also on the transcripts of a housekeeping gene encoding nucleoside hydrolase.<br>
The results obtained are given in figure 3. A significant increase in the level of the transcripts encoding the PSA is observed in Ldi IJ11 sense, and a notable decrease is observed in Ldi IJ11 antisense, compared with Ldi pTEX. No signal is observed with the wild-type strain of Ldi Monl.<br>
-	In vitro infectious capacity in the parasite-macro-<br>
phage interactions<br>
Figure 4 reports the parasitic index determined during the in vitro infection of canine macrophages with the wild-type strain or the various selected clones at various incubation times: 30 min (parasite attachment to the macrophages) , 2 h (parasite penetration) and 48 h (survival and multiplication of amastigotes).<br>
It is noted that, at 30 min and at 2 h, the Ldi IJ11 sense promastigotes exhibit a parasitic index which is approximately two times higher than those of Ldi IJ11 antisense is approximately two times lower. The same results are obtained after 48 h of infection.<br>
VII - Study of the in vivo role of the pTEX, Sense and Antisense mutant<br>
Infection of Balb/C mice by IP injection with 108 promastigotes/100 Î¼l<br>
Protocol for measuring parasitemia (parasite burdens) Bibliographic reference:  P.A.  Buffet et al.,  1995.<br>
Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. Vol. 39: 2167-2168<br>
Prepare:	1 tube of 15 ml per organ<br>
with 4 ml of SDM or RPMI medium/20% FCS<br>
Weigh  the  tubes  +  medium (weight = T in g) Cell Strainer + small Petri dishes (1 cell strainer for two same organs belonging to the same group/batch of mice) + 1 ml syringe<br>
On spleen and liver organs:<br>
For the spleen: remove the entire spleen<br>
For the liver: remove only the small lobe<br>
-	Weighing  of  organs  (organ  in  tube  +  medium,<br>
weight = TO in g)<br>
-	Grinding/homogenization with a Potter homogenizer<br>
or cell strainer in 4 ml of medium.<br>
For parasitemia/spleen:<br>
-	In a 96-well plate, remove 250 Î¼l of cells for the<br>
1st  well  and prepare  doubling  dilutions  with<br>
150 Î¼l of parasites in 150 Î¼l of medium, and then,<br>
for the following wells,  remove 150 Î¼l to be<br>
diluted in 150 Î¼l of medium, etc. Prepare 2 x 12<br>
wells of dilutions (2 rows).<br>
-	After incubation for 7 and 15 days at 26-28Â°C, the<br>
plates are examined under an inverted microscope<br>
(xl00 or x200 objective).<br>
-	Note the absence or the presence of parasites for<br>
each well. Note the last well where parasites are<br>
present.<br>
For parasitemia/liver:<br>
-	In a 96-well plate, remove 25 Î¼l of cells for the<br>
1st well containing 225 Î¼l of medium and prepare<br>
4-fold serial dilutions with 50 Î¼l of parasites in<br>
150 Î¼l of medium,  and then,  for the following wells, remove 50 Î¼l to be diluted in 150 Î¼l of medium, etc. Prepare 2 x 12 wells of dilutions (2 rows).<br>
-	After incubation for 7 and 15 days at 26-28Â°C, the<br>
plates are examined under an inverted microscope<br>
(xl00 or x200 objective).<br>
-	Note the absence or the presence of parasites for<br>
each well. Note the last well where parasites are<br>
present.<br>
The final titer corresponds to the last dilution for which the well contains at least 1 parasite.<br>
The number of parasites per gram (parasite burden) in the corresponding organ is calculated in the following way:<br>
Number of parasites = (geometric mean of the inverse titers of each duplicate/weight of section homogenized) x 400<br>
inverse of the limiting dilution<br>
Parasite burden =                                    x 400<br>
organ weight(g)<br>
N.B.: - 400 corresponds to the inverse fraction of the homogenized organ inoculated in the 1st well<br> 106  <br><br><br><br><br><br>
