NOVEL COMPOUNDS AS OPIOID RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/553342, filed March 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH<br>
OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
The research and development of the invention described below was not<br>
federally sponsored.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel opioid receptor modulators of<br>
Formula (I). The invention further relates to methods for preparing such<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in the<br>
treatment of opioid modulated disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The opioid receptors were identified in the mid-1970's, and were quickly<br>
categorized into three sub-sets of receptors (mu, delta and kappa). More<br>
recently the original three types of receptors have been further divided into sub-<br>
types. Also known is that the family of opioid receptors are members of the G-<br>
protein coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family. More physiologically pertinent<br>
are the well established facts that opioid receptors are found throughout the<br>
central and peripheral nervous system of many mammalian species, including<br>
humans, and that modulation of the respective receptors can elicit numerous,<br>
albeit different, biological effects, both desirable and undesirable (D.S. Fries,<br>
"Analgesics", in Principles of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th ed.; W.O. Foye, T.L.<br>
Lemke, and D.A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins: Baltimore, Md., 1995;<br>
pp. 247-269; J.V. Aldrich, "Analgesics", Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug<br>
Discovery, 5th Edition, Volume 3: Therapeutic Agents, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,<br>
1996, pp. 321-441). In the most current literature, the likelihood of<br>
heterodimerization of the sub-classes of opioid receptors has been reported,<br>
with respective physiological responses yet undetermined (Pierre J.M. Riviere<br>
and Jean-Louis Junien, "Opioid receptors: Targets for new gastrointestinal drug<br>
development", Drug Development 2000, pp. 203-238).<br>
A couple biological effects identified for opioid modulators have led to<br>
many useful medicinal agents. Most significant are the many centrally acting<br>
mu opioid agonist modulators marketed as analgesic agents to attenuate pain<br>
(e.g., morphine), as well as peripherally acting mu agonists to regulate motility<br>
(e.g., loperamide). Currently, clinical studies are continuing to evaluate<br>
medicinal utility of selective delta, mu, and kappa modulators, as well as<br>
compounds possessing combined sub-type modulation. It is envisioned such<br>
explorations may lead to agents with new utilities, or agents with minimized<br>
adverse side effects relative to currently available agents (examples of side<br>
effects for morphine includes constipation, respiratory depression, and<br>
addiction potential). Some new Gl areas where selective or mixed opioid<br>
modulators are currently being evaluated includes potential treatment for<br>
various diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders (post-operative ileus,<br>
constipation), and visceral pain (post operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
and inflammatory bowel disorders) (Pierre J. M. Riviere and Jean-Louis Junien,<br>
"Opioid receptors: Targets for new gastrointestinal drug development" Drug<br>
Development, 2000, pp. 203-238).<br>
Around the same time the opioid receptors were identified, the<br>
enkephalins were identified as a set of endogenous opioid ligands (D.S. Fries,<br>
"Analgesics", in Principles of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th ed.; W.O. Foye; T.L.<br>
Lemke, and D.A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins: Baltimore, Md., 1995;<br>
pp. 247-269). Schiller discovered that truncating the original pentapeptide<br>
enkephalins to simplified dipeptides yielded a series of compounds that<br>
maintained opioid activity (Schiller, P. WO 96/06855). However one potential<br>
drawback cited for such compounds is the likelihood of their inherent instability<br>
(P.W. Schiller et al., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993, 41 (3), pp. 313-316).<br>
More recently, a series of opioid pseudopeptides containing<br>
heteroaromatic or heteroaliphatic nuclei were disclosed, however this series is<br>
reported showing a different functional profile than that described in the Schiller<br>
works. (L.H. Lazarus et al„ Peptides 2000, 21, pp. 1663-1671)<br>
Most recently, works around morphine related structures were reported<br>
by Wentland, et al, where carboxamido morphine derivatives and it's analogs<br>
were prepared (M.P. Wentland etal., Biorg. Med. Chem. Letters 2001, 11, pp.<br>
1717-1721; M.P. Wentland et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Letters 2001, 11, pp. 623-<br>
626). Wentland found that substitution for the phenol moiety of the morphine<br>
related structures with a primary carboxamide led anywhere from equal<br>
activities up to 40 fold reduced activities, depending on the opioid receptor and<br>
the carboxamide. It was also revealed that any additional N-substitutions on<br>
the carboxamide significantly diminished the desired binding activity.<br>
Compounds of the present invention have not been previously disclosed<br>
and are believed to provide advantages over related compounds by providing<br>
improved pharmacological profiles<br>
Opioid receptor modulators, agonists or antagonists are useful in the<br>
treatment and prevention of various mammalian disease states, for example<br>
pain and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrheic syndromes, motility<br>
disorders including post-operative ileus and constipation, and visceral pain<br>
including post-operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel<br>
disorders.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide opioid receptor<br>
modulators. It is a further object of the invention to provide opioid receptor<br>
agonists and opioid receptor antagonists. It is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that are selective for each type of<br>
opioid receptor, mu, delta and kappa. It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that modulate two or three opioid<br>
receptor types, mu, delta and kappa, simultaneously. It is an object of the<br>
invention to provide certain instant compounds that are also useful as<br>
intermediates in preparing new opioid receptor modulators. It is also an object<br>
of the invention to provide a method of treating or ameliorating a condition<br>
mediated by an opioid receptor. And, it is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
useful pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present<br>
invention useful as an opioid receptor modulator.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may also be present in the form<br>
of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For use in medicine, the salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts" (Ref. International J. Pharm., 1986, 33, 201-217; J. Pharm.SC1-, 1997<br>
(Jan), 66, 1, 1). Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of<br>
compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts. Representative organic or inorganic acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric,<br>
acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric,<br>
benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,<br>
oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic,<br>
salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic acid. Representative organic or inorganic<br>
bases include, but are not limited to, basic or cationic salts such as benzathine,<br>
chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine,<br>
procaine, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the<br>
required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a<br>
compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the<br>
specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject. Conventional<br>
procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are<br>
described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier,<br>
1985.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as<br>
diastereomers. Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds<br>
according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers<br>
may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative<br>
chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form or as<br>
individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either stereospecific synthesis or by<br>
resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their<br>
component enantiomers or diasteromers by standard techniques, such as the<br>
formation of stereoisomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid,<br>
such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid<br>
followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The<br>
compounds may also be resolved by formation of stereoisomeric esters or<br>
amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral<br>
auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC<br>
column. It is to be understood that all stereoisomers, racemic mixtures,<br>
diastereomers and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient<br>
subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may<br>
exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present<br>
invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water<br>
(i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also<br>
intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
In general, under standard nomenclature rules used throughout this<br>
disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first<br>
followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for<br>
example, a "phenylC1-C6 alkylamidoC1-C6alkyl" substituent refers to a group of<br>
the formula: <br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a<br>
particular location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in<br>
that molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on<br>
the compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily<br>
synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth<br>
herein.<br>
An "independently" selected substituent refers to a group of substituents,<br>
wherein the substituents may be different. Therefore, designated numbers of<br>
carbon atoms (e.g. C1-8) shall refer independently to the number of carbon<br>
atoms in an alkyl or cycloalkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger<br>
substituent in which alkyl appears as its prefix root.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, "alkyl" whether used alone or as<br>
part of a substituent group refers to straight and branched carbon chains<br>
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range. The term "alkoxy"<br>
refers to an -Oalkyl substituent group, wherein alkyl is as defined supra.<br>
Similarly, the terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to straight and branched<br>
carbon chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range,<br>
wherein an alkenyl chain has at least one double bond in the chain and an<br>
alkynyl chain has at least one triple bond in the chain. An alkyl and alkoxy<br>
chain may be substituted on a carbon atom. In substituent groups with multiple<br>
alkyl groups such as (C1-6alkyl)2amino- the C1-6alkyl; groups of the dialkylamino<br>
may be the same or different.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated or partially unsaturated, moncyclic<br>
or polycyclic hydrocarbon rings of from 3 to 14 carbon atom members. Examples<br>
of such rings include, and are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,<br>
cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and adamantyl. Alternatively, the cycloalkyl ring may be<br>
fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused cycloalkyl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl<br>
ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional nitrogen) to form<br>
a heteroaryl fused cycloalkyl.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" refers to a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 7<br>
members in which 1 to 2 members are nitrogen, or a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5<br>
to 7 members in which zero, one or two members are nitrogen and up to two<br>
members are oxygen or sulfur; wherein, optionally, the ring contains zero to one<br>
unsaturated bonds, and, optionally, when the ring is of 6 or 7 members, it<br>
contains up to two unsaturated bonds. The term "heterocyclyl" includes a 5 to 7<br>
membered monocyclic heterocyclic ring fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused<br>
heterocyclyl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and,<br>
optionally, one additional nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl<br>
ring, a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclyl ring (of the same definition as above but<br>
absent the option of a further fused ring) or fused with the carbon of attachment of<br>
a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or heterocyclyl ring to form a spiro moiety. For instant<br>
compounds of the invention, the carbon atom ring members that form the<br>
heterocyclyl ring are fuliy saturated. Other compounds of the invention may have<br>
a partially saturated heterocyclyl ring. The term "heterocyclyl" also includes a 5 to<br>
7 membered monocyclic heterocycle bridged to form bicyclic rings. Such<br>
compounds are not considered to be fully aromatic and are not referred to as<br>
heteroaryl compounds. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include, and are not<br>
limited to, pyrrolinyl (including 2H-pyrrole, 2-pyrrolinyl or 3-pyrrolinyl), pyrrolidinyl,<br>
2-imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, 2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl,<br>
thiotnorpholinyl and piperazinyl.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an unsaturated, aromatic monocyclic ring of 6<br>
carbon members or to an unsaturated, aromatic polycyclic ring of from 10 to 14<br>
carbon members. Examples of such aryl rings include, and are not limited to,<br>
phenyl, naphthalenyl or anthracenyl. Preferred aryl groups for the practice of this<br>
invention are phenyl and naphthalenyl.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic ring of 5 or 6 members<br>
wherein the ring consists of carbon atoms and has at least one heteroatom<br>
member. Suitable heteroatoms include nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. In the case<br>
of 5 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring contains one member of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen or sulfur and, in addition, may contain up to three additional nitrogens.<br>
In the case of 6 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring may contain from one to<br>
three nitrogen atoms. For the case wherein the 6 membered ring has three<br>
nitrogens, at most two nitrogen atoms are adjacent. Optionally, the heteroaryl<br>
ring is fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heteroaryl), a 5 or 6 membered<br>
heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional<br>
nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl ring or a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclo<br>
ring (as defined supra but absent the option of a further fused ring). Examples of<br>
heteroaryl groups include, and are not limited to, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl,<br>
thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl,<br>

The term "arylalkyl" means an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group<br>
(e.g., benzyl, phenethyl). Similarly, the term "arylalkoxy" indicates an alkoxy<br>
group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyloxy).<br>
The term "halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
Substituents that are substituted with multiple halogens are substituted in a<br>
manner that provides compounds, which are stable.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in<br>
a name of a substituent (e.g., arylalkyl, alkylamino) it shall be interpreted as<br>
including those limitations given above for "alkyl" and "aryl." Designated<br>
numbers of carbon atoms (e.g., CrCe) shall refer independently to the number<br>
of carbon atoms in an alkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger substituent<br>
in which alkyl appears as its prefix root. For alkyl, and alkoxy substituents the<br>
designated number of carbon atoms includes all of the independent member<br>
included in the range specified individually and all the combination of ranges<br>
within in the range specified. For example C-i-6 alkyl would include methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl individually as well as sub-combinations<br>
thereof (e.g. C1-2, C1-3, C-m, C1.5, C2-6, C3.6, C4.6, C5.6, C2.5, etc.).<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a<br>
researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention are useful opioid receptor<br>
modulators. In particular, certain compounds are opioid receptor agonists<br>
useful in the treatment or amelioration of conditions such as pain and<br>
gastrointestinal disorders. Examples of pain intended to be within the scope of<br>
the present invention include, but are not limited to, centrally mediated pain,<br>
peripherally mediated pain, structural or soft tissue injury related pain, pain<br>
related to inflammation, progressive disease related pain, neuropathic pain and<br>
acute pain such as caused by acute injury, trauma or surgery and chronic pain<br>
such as caused by neuropathic pain conditions, diabetic peripheral neuropathy,<br>
post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, post-stroke pain syndromes or<br>
cluster or migraine headaches. Examples of gastrointestinal disorders<br>
intended to be within the scope of this invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders such as diarrhea-predominant, or<br>
alternating irritable bowel syndrome, and visceral pain and diarrhea associated<br>
with inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's<br>
disease.<br>
Examples of gastrointestinal disorders where opioid receptor ("OR")<br>
antagonists are useful include constipation-predominant irritable bowel<br>
syndrome, post-operative ileus and constipation, including but not limited to the<br>
constipation associated with treatment of chronic pain with opiates. Modulation<br>
of mere than one opioid receptor subtype is also useful as follows: a<br>
compound that is a mixed mu OR agonist and delta OR antagonist could have<br>
antidiarrheal properties without being profoundly constipating. A compound<br>
that is a mixed mu OR agonist and delta OR agonist areuseful in cases of<br>
severe diarrhea that are refractory to treatment with pure mu OR agonists, or<br>
has additional utility in treating visceral pain associated with inflammation and<br>
diarrhea.<br>
Accordingly, a compound of the present invention may be administered<br>
by any conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral,<br>
nasal, pulmonary, sublingual, ocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and<br>
parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.). It<br>
is currently preferred that the compounds of the present invention be<br>
administered via modes of administration other than pulmonary or parenteral<br>
administration. However, the preferred compounds provided in Table IV may<br>
be administered via pulmonary or parenteral modes of administration.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or<br>
more compounds of Formula (I) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is<br>
intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety<br>
of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g.<br>
oral or parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well<br>
known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients.<br>
published by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical<br>
Society of Great Britain.<br>
Methods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions have been<br>
described in numerous publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br>
Tablets, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded. Volumes 1-3, edited by<br>
Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications.<br>
Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br>
Disperse Systems. Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by<br>
Marcel Dekker, Inc.<br>
In preparing a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention in<br>
liquid dosage form for oral, topical and parenteral administration, any of the<br>
usual pharmaceutical media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid<br>
dosage forms, such as suspensions (i.e. colloids, emulsions and dispersions)<br>
and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, dispersants, flocculation agents,<br>
thickeners, pH control agents (i.e. buffers), osmotic agents, coloring agents,<br>
flavors, fragrances, preservatives (i.e. to control microbial growth, etc.) and a<br>
liquid vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be<br>
required for each liquid dosage form.<br>
In solid oral preparations such as, for example, dry powders for<br>
reconstitution or inhalation, granules, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills and<br>
tablets (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release<br>
formulations), suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to<br>
diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, glidants, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be<br>
sugar coated, gelatin coated, film coated or enteric coated by standard<br>
techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit,<br>
e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of<br>
the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g.,<br>
tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from<br>
about 0.01 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg (preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to<br>
about 100 mg/kg; and, more preferably, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30<br>
mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about<br>
300 mg/kg/day (preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day<br>
and more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 30 mg/kg/day).<br>
Preferably, the method for the treatment of conditions that may be mediated by<br>
opioid receptors described in the present invention using any of the compounds<br>
as defined herein, the dosage form will contain a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier containing between from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg; and, more<br>
preferably, from about 5 mg to about 50 mg of the compound, and may be<br>
constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. The<br>
dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the<br>
subjects, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being<br>
employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may<br>
be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules, dry powders for reconstitution or inhalation, granules,<br>
lozenges, sterile solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays,<br>
drops, or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal, sublingual,<br>
intraocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, dry powder inhaler or other inhalation<br>
or insufflation means.<br>
For preparing solid pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, the<br>
principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives,<br>
disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents and gildants. Suitable diluents include,<br>
but are not limited to, starch (i.e. corn, wheat, or potato starch, which may be<br>
hydrolized), lactose (granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-<br>
based diluents (confectioner's sugar; sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent<br>
invert sugar; sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose<br>
plus invert sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight<br>
percent cornstarch and magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol,<br>
sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL ™ microcrystalline cellulose<br>
available from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate,<br>
calcium lactate trihydrate and the like. Suitable binders and adhesives include,<br>
but are not limited to acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose, gelatin,<br>
glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium<br>
carbdxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e.<br>
alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose [i.e. TYLOSE ™ available from Hoechst Celanese],<br>
polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch) and the like. Suitable<br>
disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (corn, potato, etc.),<br>
sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium aluminum<br>
silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose and<br>
microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. corn starch,<br>
etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum),<br>
cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and<br>
antiadherents include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium<br>
and sodium), stearic acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride,<br>
DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate,<br>
sodium acetate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate and the like.<br>
Suitable gildants include, but are not limited to, talc, cornstarch, silica (i.e. CAB-<br>
O-SIL ™ silica available from Cabot, SYLOID ™ silica available from W.R.<br>
Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL ™ silica available from Degussa) and the like.<br>
Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to<br>
improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and<br>
coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of<br>
identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are<br>
formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate<br>
dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.<br>
Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to<br>
form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of<br>
the pharmaceutical active of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of<br>
three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c) dry<br>
blending- When referring to these preformulation compositions as<br>
homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly<br>
throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided<br>
into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This<br>
solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of the<br>
active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills containing the<br>
novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or pills to<br>
provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual<br>
release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage<br>
component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The<br>
two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact<br>
into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be<br>
used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of<br>
polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate (i.e. cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, cellulose acetate trimetllitate), polyvinyl acetate phthalate,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate<br>
succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers, methacrylate and methyl<br>
methacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release tablets may also be<br>
made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or insoluble<br>
substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding agents)<br>
or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may incorporate<br>
the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers<br>
waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, carnauba<br>
wax, cetyl alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids<br>
metallic soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate,<br>
coat, entrap or otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a<br>
prolonged or sustained release product.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention<br>
may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not<br>
limited to aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar,<br>
alginate (i.e. propylene alginate, sodium alginate and the like), guar, karaya,<br>
locust bean, pectin, tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellubsics such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylceliulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e. carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene<br>
glycol; clays such as bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin or the<br>
like. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to sodium docusate,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, polysorbate 20,<br>
poiysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 80, polyoxamer 188, polyoxamer<br>
235 and combinations thereof. Suitable deflocculating or dispersing agent<br>
include pharmaceutical grade lecithins. Suitable flocculating agent include but<br>
are not limited to simple neutral electrolytes (i.e. sodium chloride, potassium,<br>
chloride, and the like), highly charged insoluble polymers and polyelectrolyte<br>
species, water soluble divalent ortrivalent ions (i.e. calcium salts, alums or<br>
sulfates, citrates and phosphates (which can be used jointly in formulations as<br>
pH buffers and flocculating agents). Suitable preservatives include but are not<br>
limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl), sorbic acid,<br>
thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid,<br>
chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid<br>
vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the<br>
liquid vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with<br>
the suspending agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty<br>
esters and oils liquid vehicles are best used with suspending agents such as<br>
low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite,<br>
water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming polymers and the like.<br>
Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols, polyols and glycols are best<br>
used with suspending agents such as higher HLB surfactants, clays silicates,<br>
gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers and the like.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in<br>
an intranasal dosage form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via<br>
transdermal skin patches, the composition of which are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of course, be continuous<br>
rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and<br>
dosage regimens established in the art whenever treatment of disorders that may<br>
be mediated or ameliorated by opioid receptors for a subject in need thereof.<br>
The daily dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
may be varied over a wide range from about 0.1 mg to about 7000 mg per adult<br>
human per day; most preferably the dose will be in the range of from about 0.7<br>
mg to about 2100 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05,<br>
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0, 50.0,100,150, 200, 250 and 500<br>
milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage<br>
to the subject to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied<br>
at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of<br>
body weight per day; and, most preferably, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30<br>
mg/kg of body weight per day. Advantageously, a compound of the present<br>
invention may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage<br>
may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, and the advancement of the<br>
disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular subject<br>
being treated, including subject age, weight, diet and time of administration, will<br>
result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate therapeutic level.<br>

SYNTHETIC METHODS<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized<br>
in accordance with the general synthetic methods described below and are<br>
illustrated more particularly in the schemes that follow. Since the schemes are<br>
an illustration, the invention should not be construed as being limited by the<br>
chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the various<br>
starting materials used in the schemes is well within the skill of persons versed<br>
in the art.<br>
The following schemes describe general synthetic methods whereby<br>
intermediate and target compounds of the present invention may be prepared.<br>
Additional representative compounds and stereoisomers, racemic mixtures,<br>
diasteromers and enantiomers thereof can be synthesized using the<br>
intermediates prepared in accordance to the general schemes and other<br>
materials, compounds and reagents known to those skilled in the art. All such<br>
compounds, stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diasteromers and enantiomers<br>
thereof are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Certain intermediates and compounds of the present invention may be<br>
prepared according to the process outlined in Scheme A below.<br>
H2N-R5 or ammonium acetate and cyclized upon heating in acetic acid to a<br>
compound of formula A-4.<br>
The protecting group of compound A-4 may be removed using<br>
conditions known to those skilled in the art that are appropriate for the<br>
particular protecting group to afford a compound of the formula A-6. For<br>
instance, hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst is one method<br>
for the removal of a CBZ protecting group, whereas treatment with an acid such<br>
as TFA is effective for a BOC group deprotection.<br>
A compound of formula A-6 may be substituted using reductive<br>
amination with an appropriately substituted aldehyde or ketone in the presence<br>
of a hydride source, such as sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
triacetoxyborohydride, provide compounds of formula A-10.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula A-3 may be condensed with a<br>
dicarbonyl compound of the formula Ra(C=0)2R3 and an amine of the formula<br>
H2N-R5 upon heating in acetic acid to afford a compound of the formula A-4.<br>
When compound A-3 is protected with a BOC group, a by-product of formula<br>
A-5 may be produced. Compounds of formula A-4 or A-5 may be treated with<br>
a hydride source such as lithium aluminum hydride to give certain compounds<br>
of formula A-10.<br>
Similarly, a compound of formula A-7 may be coupled to an a-<br>
aminoketone as described above for compounds of formula A-1 to yield the<br>
corresponding compounds of formula A-8. A compound of formula A-8 may<br>
then be cyclized in the presence of an amine of formula H2N-R5 or ammonium<br>
acetate and subsequently deprotected as described above to arrive at<br>
compounds of formula A-10.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention may be prepared according<br>
to the process outlined in Scheme B below.<br>
More specifically, a compound of formula B-1 (wherein the imidazole<br>
nitrogen is substituted with R5, as defined herein, or R5a, a nitrogen protecting<br>
group such as SEM, MOM, or the like) may be deprotonated with an<br>
organometallic base such as n-butyllithium and then treated with a suitably<br>
substituted amide to yield a compound of formula B-2.<br>
Compound B-2 may be brominated to yield a mixture of regioisomers of<br>
formula B-3. A compound of formula B-3 may be further elaborated via a<br>
reductive amination with an amine of the formula H2N-R1 in the presence of a<br>
hydride source as described in Scheme A to afford a compound of formula 8-4.<br>
The amine of a compound of formula B-4 may be coupled with a suitable<br>
carboxylic acid under standard peptide coupling conditions with a coupling<br>
agent such as EDCI and an additive such as HOBt to yield compounds of<br>
formula B-5.<br>
Certain R3 substituents of the present invention in which a carbon atom<br>
is the point of attachment may be introduced into a compound of formula B-5<br>
through a transition metal-catalyzed cross coupling reaction to afford<br>
compounds of formula B-6. Suitable palladium catalysts include palladium<br>
tetrakis triphenylphosphine and the like. Suitable Lewis acids for the reaction<br>
include boronic acids and the like. Compounds protected with R53 may be<br>
deprotected under acidic conditions to yield compounds of formula B-7.<br>

One skilled in the art will recognize that substituent L (depicted as O in<br>
the formulae of Scheme B) may be further elaborated to S or N(Rd) of the<br>
present invention using conventional, known chemical methods.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention may be prepared according<br>
to the process outlined in Scheme C below.<br>
More specifically, a compound of formula A-10, B-8, or B-9 may be<br>
elaborated to a compound of formula C-2 through coupling with a suitable<br>
carboxylic acid under standard peptide coupling conditions as described above.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that substituent L in a compound of formula<br>
C-2(o'epicted as O ) may be converted to S or N(Rd) of the present invention<br>
using conventional, known chemical methods.<br>
Suitably substituted carboxylic acids of the present invention may either<br>
be commercially available or prepared by reported protocols in the scientific<br>
literature. Several chemical routes for preparing certain compounds of formula<br>
C-1 are outlined below in Schemes D and E.<br>
Specifically, a compound of formula D-1 may be treated with<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride to afford the triflate compound of formula D-<br>
2. A compound of formula D-2 may be converted to a compound of formula D-<br>
4 by a variety chemical routes which utilize conventional chemical methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art. For example, the bromo group of a compound<br>
of formula D-2 may undergo a carboxylation reaction via an initial carbonylation<br>
under a carbon monoxide atmosphere in the presence of an appropriate<br>
palladium catalyst and DPPF, followed by an aqueous basic workup to afford a<br>
compound of formula D-3. Subsequently, the carboxyl group may be converted<br>
to a substituent of R41a of formula D-4 using standard peptide coupling<br>
conditions. Alternatively, a compound of formula D-4 may be directly prepared<br>
via a carbonylation of compound of formula D-2, followed by treatment with<br>
HMDS, or a primary or secondary amine.<br>
The compound of formula D-5, known or prepared by known methods,<br>
may be treated with EDC in the presence of copper (I) chloride to afford the<br>
corresponding alkene of formula D6. A compound of formula D-6 may then<br>
undergo a Heck reaction with a compound of formula D-4 in the presence of an<br>
appropriate palladium catalyst and phosphino ligand to afford a compound of<br>
formula D7. Subsequent hydrogenation of the alkenyl substituent using<br>
standard hydrogen reduction methods affords a compound of formula D-8.<br>
Scheme E demonstrates an alternative method for preparing<br>
intermediate D-7 of the present invention. A compound of formula E-1 may be<br>
elaborated to a compound of formula E-4 using the appropriately adapted<br>
synthetic steps described in Scheme D. One skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that this transformation may be achieved by manipulation of the reaction<br>
sequence. A compound of formula E-4 may be converted to its corresponding<br>
nitrile via an aromatic nucleophilic displacement reaction with cyanide anion.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that a nitrile substituent is a viable synthon<br>
for a substituent of R41a.<br>
A compound of formula E-4 may participate in a Horner-Wadsworth-<br>
Emmons reaction with a compound of formula E-7 in the presence of an<br>
organometallic base such as n-butyllithiium to afford a compound of formula D-<br>
7. This intermediate may be further elaborated as described in Scheme D,<br>
herein.<br><br>
More specifically, a compound of formula F-1, wherein R11 is an<br>
aikoxycarbonyl as defined above, may be saponified to its corresponding acid,<br>
a compound of formula F-2.<br>
A compound of formula F-3 wherein R11 is a cyano substituent may be<br>
elaborated to its corresponding aminocarbonyl, compound F-4 by treatment<br>
with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of hydroxide anion. Similarly, when R3<br>
is a cyano-substituted aryl ring, it may be treated as described above to form<br>
an aminocarbonyl-substituted aryl ring.<br>
Certain substitutents of R11 may be installed via a palladium catalyzed<br>
coupling reaction with an X-substituted precursor. For example, a compound of<br>
formula F-5 wherein X is iodide, bromide, tosylate, triflate, or the like may be<br>
treated with Zn(CN)2 in the presence of palladium tetrakis triphenylphosphine to<br>
give a compound of formula F-6 wherein R11 is cyano.<br>
Treatment of a compound of formula F-5 with Pd(OAc)2 and a ligand<br>
such as 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene under a carbon monoxide<br>
atmosphere provides a compound of formula F-6 wherein R11 is a carboxy<br>
substituent.<br>
The palladium catalyzed couplings described above may also be used to<br>
install cyano, carboxy, and aikoxycarbonyl substituents onto an aryl ring at R3.<br>

Example 1<br>
Rat Brain Delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Male, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) are<br>
killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately<br>
in ice cold Tris HCI buffer (50 mWI, pH 7.4). The forebrains are separated from<br>
the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the<br>
colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After<br>
dissection, the forebrains are homogenized in Tris buffer in a Teflon® glass<br>
homogenizer. The homogenate is diluted to a concentration of 1 g of forebrain<br>
tissue per 80 ml_ Tris and centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet is<br>
resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM MgCk with<br>
several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate preparation<br>
is used for the delta opioid binding assays. Following incubation with the delta<br>
selective peptide ligand ~4 nM [3H]DPDPE at 25°C for 2.5 h in a 96-well plate<br>
with total volume of 1 ml_, the plate contents are filtered through Wallac<br>
filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters are rinsed three<br>
times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and dried in a microwave oven 2<br>
min twice. To each sample area 2 x 50 ^L of Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid<br>
(LKB) is added and analyzed on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid<br>
scintillation counter.<br>
The data are used to calculate either the % inhibition compared to control<br>
binding (when only a single concentration of test compound is evaluated) or a<br>
Kj value (when a range of concentrations is tested). % inhibition is calculated<br>
as: [(total dpm-test compound dpm)/ (total dpm-nonspecific dpm)]*100. Kd and<br>
Ki values were calculated using GraphPad PRISM data analysis program. The<br>
biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table<br>

tissue per 80 mL Tris and centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet is<br>
resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM MgCI2 with<br>
several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate preparation<br>
is used for the mu-opioid binding assays. Following incubation with the mu<br>
selective peptide ligand .about.0.8 nM [3H]DAMGO at 25°C for 2.5 h in a 96-<br>
well plate with total 1 mL, the plate contents are filtered through Wallac filtermat<br>
B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters are rinsed three times with<br>
2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), and dried in a microwave oven 2 min twice. To<br>
each sample area 2 x 50 jaL of Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid (LKB) is added<br>
and analyzed on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter.<br>
The data are used to calculate either the % inhibition compared to<br>
control binding (when only a single concentration of test compound is<br>
evaluated) or a K| value (when a range of concentrations is tested). %<br>
inhibition is calculated as: [(total dpm-test compound dpm)/ (total dpm-<br>
nonspecific dpm)]*100. Kd and Ki values were calculated using GraphPad<br>
PRISM data analysis program. The biological activity of the compounds of the<br>
present invention is shown in Table VII.<br>

Rat Brain Mu Opioid Receptor Binding Assay-Version 2a<br>
Male, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, NY) were<br>
killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately<br>
in iC6-cold Tris HCI buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains were separated<br>
from the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at<br>
the colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After<br>
dissection, the forebrains were homogenized in Tris buffer in a Teflon®-glass<br>
homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted to a concentration of 1 g of<br>
forebrain tissue per 80 ml_ Tris and centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The<br>
pellet was resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM<br>
MgCI2 with several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate<br>
preparation was used for the mu opioid binding assay. Following incubation<br>
with 0.8 nM of the mu selective ligand [3H]DAMGO at 25°C for 2.5 h in a 96-well<br>
plate with total 1 mL, the plate contents were filtered through Wallac filtermat B<br>

2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and dried in a microwave oven. To each<br>
sample area, Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid (LKB) was added and the<br>
resulting radioactivity quantified on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid<br>
scintillation counter. Kd and Ki values were calculated using the GraphPad<br>

Human Mu Opioid Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Membranes from Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing the human u<br>
opioid receptor (Perkin Elmer #RBHOMM400UA) are homogenized in assay<br>
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 with 5 mM MgCI2) using a glass tissue grinder,<br>
Teflon pestle and a Steadfast Stirrer (Fisher Scientific). The concentration of<br>
membranes is adjusted to 300 ug/mL in assay buffer and 100 uL is dispensed<br>
into each well of the assay plate, a 96 well round bottom polypropylene plate.<br>
Compounds to be tested are solubilized in DMSO (Pierce), 10 mM, then diluted<br>
in assay buffer to 6X the desired final concentration. The ligand, 3H-Damgo<br>
(Perkin Elmer #NET-902) is also diluted in assay buffer to 3.6 nM. In a second<br>
96 well round bottom polypropylene plate, known as the premix plate, 60 pL of<br>
the 6X compound is combined with 60 uL of 3.6 nM 3H-Damgo. From this<br>
premix plate 50 |jL is transferred to the assay plate containing the membranes,<br>
in duplicate. The assay plate is incubated for 2 h at room temperature. A GF/C<br>
96 well filter plate (Perkin Elmer #6005174) is pretreated with 0.3%<br>
polyethylenimine for 30 min. The contents of the assay plate are filtered<br>
through the filter plate using a Packard Filtermate Harvester, and washed 3<br>
times with 0.9% saline that is 4°C. The filter plate is dried, the underside<br>
sealed, and 30 uL Microscint20 (Packard #6013621) added to each well. A<br>
Topcount-NXT Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard) is used to measure<br>
emitted energies in the range of 2.9 to 35 KeV. Results are compared to<br>
maximum binding, wells receiving no inhibitors. Nonspecific binding is<br>
determined in the presence of 1 uM unlabelled Damgo (Tocris #1171). The<br>
biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table<br>

In Vivo Assay-Stress-induced Fecal Output (fecal output for I hr)<br>
This assay evaluates the fecal output in novel environment-stressed<br>
mice to that of acclimated controls.<br>
Methods: Adult, male, CrkCD-l(ICR) mice, weighing ~ 30-35 g were<br>
used in these studies, with a minimum of 10 mice per dose group. One group<br>
of mice was assigned as acclimated, or "non-stressed" controls. These control<br>
mice were transported from colony housing, where they were housed 3/cage in<br>
polycarbonate cages with access to food and water ad lib. to the procedure<br>
room. The mice were removed from their home cages and individually housed<br>
in 20 cm wide x 20 cm deep x 15 cm tall cages, equipped with a wire mesh<br>
bottom where they remained for a 16 - 18 hr period of acclimation to their novel<br>
environment. Mice were allowed access to food and water ad lib. during<br>
acclimation. The other groups of mice were assigned as non-acclimated, or<br>
"stressed" treatment groups. Each mouse in each group was weighed and<br>
vehicle, or test compound, was intragastrically administered by oral intubation<br>
in 0.5% methylcellulose. Mice were allowed access to water only ad lib. during<br>
the test period. After compound administrations, acclimated (control) as well as<br>
non-acclimated (stressed) mice were individually housed in a 20 cm wide x 20<br>
cm deep x 15 cm tail cage, with a wire mesh bottom. An absorbant cardboard<br>
is placed beneath the cages. The number of fecal pellets excreted by each<br>
mouse was determined at hourly intervals following placement of the mice in<br>
the individual cages. Raw Data = # of fecal pellets/mouse/hr. The mean fecal<br>
pellet output for each test group was calculated and the results expressed as a<br>
percent of the mean fecal pellet output of the control group (the acclimated,<br>
non-stressed group, to which vehicle only was administered). ANOVA was<br>
performed and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test used to compare the means,<br>
which were considered significantly different when P

In Vivo Assay: Stress-induced Entire Gl Tract Transit (6 hour transit time test)<br>
Methods: The animals used in these studies are male CD-1 mice, ave.<br>
wt. ~30g. Procedure: Mice were housed in LAM under 12h/12h light/dark<br>
cycle, food &amp; water ad lib. On the day before the experiments, the mice<br>
assigned to the "acclimated" (non-stressed) control group were placed into<br>
individual wire mesh-bottomed cages, provided food and water ad lib. The<br>
acclimated control group was in this new environment for 16-18 hrs prior to<br>
beginning the test. On the day of the experiment, mice assigned to<br>
experimental groups were housed in home cages were transported to<br>
procedure room and remain in their home cages until the start of the transit<br>
portion of the study. Mice were intragastrically dosed with compounds (volume<br>
remains constant at 0.1 mU10g body wt) by oral gavage 30 minutes before<br>
carmine (a red vital dye that does not have the drug-adsorbing properties of<br>
charcoal) is administered (0.25 ml_, 6% carmine in 0.5% methylcellulose). After<br>
the carmine marker was administered each mouse was placed in the novel<br>
environment cage. One hour after administration of carmine, the fecal pellet<br>
output of each animal was recorded. At one-hour intervals thereafter the fecal<br>
pellets were examined for the presence of carmine-dye. The number of mice<br>
that excreted a carmine-containing fecal pellet at the end of each hour post<br>
carmine administration was recorded, until all mice had excreted carmine in a<br>
fecal pellet or the end of 6 hrs post carmine administration, whichever occurred<br>
first. A variant of this novel environment stress (NES) paradigm is to use the<br>
same procedures of dye and compound administrations, but to use restraint<br>
(confinement in a small plastic tube for 3 hr) as a stressor (RS = restraint<br>
stress), followed by two hours in an individual cage (total of 5 hr fecal transit<br>
time). Data is shown in Table XIII. The original data are quanta!, i.e. a mouse in<br>
the treatment group either did, or did not exhibit entire Gl tract transit (excrete<br>
colored feces). The mouse entire Gl tract (MEGIT) transit test can thus be done<br>
in mice that are all acclimated (non-stressed), in which case the data are<br>
expressed as % control (vehicle only), or in mice that are exposed to NES or<br>
RS, in which cases the data are expressed as % of the vehicle treated NES or<br>
RS group. Data is shown in Table XIII.<br><br>
Methods: The animals used in these studies were male CD-1 mice, ave.<br>
wt. ~30g. Mice were housed under 12h/12h light/dark cycle, food &amp; water ad<br>
lib. On the day of the experiment mice were assigned to experimental groups,<br>
including one vehicle-only group (=control). At 30 min before administration of<br>
carmine dye, animals were dosed with vehicle or vehicle-plus-compound, mice<br>
were returned to their home cages after drug administration. After<br>
administration of carmine, the animals were either returned to their home cages<br>
(non-stressed) or individually placed in the same metal cages as used in the<br>
fecal output or entire Gl tract transit to induce a novel environment stress. One<br>
hour after administration of carmine, mice were sacrificed by cervical<br>
dislocation, the abdomen opened midventrally, the small intestine from pylorus<br>
to cecum was removed, the mesentery divided in order to lay the intestine<br>
straight &amp; flat - without stretching. The total length of intestine and the length of<br>
carmine-dyed intestine were measured in order to determine the percent of the<br>
upper Gl tract over which transit had occurred as follows: {(Length of carmine-<br>
dyed intestine)/(Total length of intestine)} x 100 = % upper Gl transit. The data<br>
expressed were group means ± SD (or s.e.m.) and data expressed as % of<br>
control. Statistics: ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test and means<br>
were considered significantly different when P

Method: Rats were chronically instrumented with EMG electrodes in the<br>
muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. Distention of an intracolonic balloon,<br>

stimulation 4 hours after zymosan is administered to the colon (Figure 1).<br>
Animals with 10% higher visceromotor responses for at least two distending<br>
