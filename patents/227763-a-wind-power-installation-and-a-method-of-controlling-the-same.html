				<td>A Wind Power Installation And A Method of Controlling The Same<br>
When planning and setting up wind power installations the visual<br>
detractions to be expected on the part of the wind power installation on the<br>
environment play an increasingly important part in approval and<br>
acceptance. If for example a wind power installation is placed in the<br>
proximity of a residence, it is possible, when the sun is in unfavourable<br>
positions, that the wind power installation or the rotor thereof is between<br>
the sun and the residence. If the sunshine is not affected by cloud, the<br>
rotating rotor constantly throws a (strobing) shadow on to the property.<br>
The shadow casting caused by the wind power installation on the adjoining<br>
properties is often perceived by the residents as being very troublesome.<br>
Even if the wind power installation satisfies the legal approval requirements<br>
there is however not always any guarantee that the undesired shadow<br>
casting effect is prevented.<br>
DE 199 29 970 Al discloses a shadow casting regulating system in<br>
which the intensity of light is detected in order to derive therefrom whether<br>
a shadow can occur at all.<br>
It will be noted however that an adequate level of light intensity is<br>
only one of the prerequisites for a shadow to occur. A further prerequisite is<br>
for example clear air. Under hazy visual conditions, the light is diffuse so<br>
that only slight or no shadowing occurs, in spite of the high level of light-<br>
intensity. Control of a wind power installation, which is based on the<br>
intensity of the light, can result in a shutdown although there is no shadow.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a wind power<br>
installation, by means of which that disadvantage is overcome.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a wind power installation<br>
comprising a data processing apparatus which controls the wind power<br>
installation and in which are stored the positions of the sun or values<br>
representative in that respect, in respect of which shutdown of the installation<br>
can take place, characterized in that the wind power installation is coupled to at<br>
least three light sensors which are arranged uniformly spaced around the wind<br>
power installation and by means of which the respectively current intensity of<br>
light and shadow or the intensity of light and shadow ascertained over a certain<br>
time is measured, and that the data determined by the light sensors are<br>
processed by the data processing apparatus and shutdown of the wind power<br>
installation is effected if the difference between light and shadow is above a<br>
predetermined value when a predetermined position of the sun is assumed.<br>
Preferably, beyond the stored positions of the sun, fresh positions of the sun for<br>
further immission points can be stored, which is effected by means of suitable<br>
programming.<br>
There is also provided a method of controlling a wind power installation,<br>
comprising the steps of controlling the wind power installation by a data<br>
processing apparatus, storing predetermined positions of the sun or values<br>
representative of the predetermined positions of the sun in respect of which a<br>
shutdown of the wind power installation can take place, wherein at least three<br>
light sensors are arranged uniformly spaced around the wind power installation,<br>
measuring the respective current light intensity in a light receiving region and in a<br>
shadowed region or the respective light intensities in said regions ascertained<br>
over a certain time by means of the at least three light sensors, processing the<br>
data determined by the light sensors, and shutting down the wind power<br>
installation if the difference between the light intensity in said regions is above a<br>
predetermined value when a predetermined position of the sun is assumed.<br>
Preferably, the method shuts down the wind power installation only at a<br>
predetermined position of the sun. Preferably, the wind power installation is at<br>
least temporarily shut down at a predetermined position of the sun.<br><br>
According to the invention that object is attained by a method of<br>
operating a wind power installation as set forth in claim 1. Advantageous<br>
developments are described in the appendant claims.<br>
The invention is based on the realisation that shadow casting can<br>
occur only at a given position of the sun and with given light conditions or<br>
cloud cover if there is direct solar irradiation with a high level of light<br>
intensity. As however the cloud cover cannot be detected directly, but<br>
nonetheless can result in diffuse light in which no significant shadow<br>
occurs, a difference in brightness between light and shadow, which can be<br>
easily detected, is used. If the difference stays below a predetermined<br>
value, accordingly no clearly perceptible shadow occurs and therefore there<br>
is no need for the wind power installation to be shut down.<br>
On the other hand, a disturbing shadow can occur even with a<br>
comparatively low level of light intensity. That can again be easily<br>
ascertained by detecting the difference in brightness between light and<br>
shadow.<br>
As is known, the position of the sun is dependent on the time of the<br>
year and the time of day and can be ascertained by means of measurement<br>
or calculation programs for any relevant immission point (that is the<br>
location [region] at which shadow casting can occur). The basis for shadow-<br>
based shutdown of a wind power installation is accordingly the calculated<br>
times in which shadow casting can occur in respect of a neighbouring<br>
resident (at the immission point) because of the position of the sun and the<br>
geographical arrangement of the installation. In parallel with the<br>
predetermined times in respect of the position of the sun, the difference<br>
between light and shadow is ascertained by way of light sensors and thus<br>
the plausibility of shadow casting occurring is checked. It is only if a<br>
shadow occurs during the predetermined times in respect of the position of<br>
the sun, at which a shadow can be cast at the immission point, that<br>
shadow-based shutdown of the wind power installation occurs.<br>
In the case of the wind power installation according to the invention,<br>
shadow-based shutdown can be implemented by way of an input/display<br>
device (LC display). For that purpose the settings or values of the current<br><br>
levels of light intensity and the shutdown difference between light and<br>
shadow can be read off. In addition, it is possible to see from the display<br>
the status that the shutdown has at the current time, that is to say whether<br>
it is switched on or off or is active or inactive. Input of the shutdown times<br>
can be predetermined or loaded, in a separate menu.<br>
In the mode 'shadow-based shutdown', the parameters current first<br>
light intensity (with direct light incidence) (value in %), current second light<br>
intensity (in a shadowed region) (value in %), shutdown difference (value<br>
in %), shadow shutdown (on/off) or shadow shutdown (active/inactive) are<br>
displayed. In that respect the shutdown difference is a value of the<br>
difference between the first light intensity (direct light irradiation) and the<br>
second light intensity (shadowed) at which the wind power installation is to<br>
be shut down. If for example a wind power installation is very close to an<br>
immission point, the shadow which is cast can be disturbing even when the<br>
sky is slightly overcast. Therefore in that case (the wind power installation<br>
is very close to the immission point in question), the installation should<br>
receive a lower value for the shutdown difference, than for the situation<br>
where the immission point is further away from the wind power installation.<br>
In regard to the levels of light intensity, a low percentage value signifies a<br>
low level of light intensity (for example when the sky is overcast) and a<br>
high percentage value signifies a strong light intensity, for example direct<br>
sun irradiation, which indicates that the solar irradiation is not disturbed by<br>
cloud cover or mist. Shadow shutdown (on/off) indicates whether that is at<br>
all activated. Shadow shutdown (active/inactive) specifies whether the<br>
installation is shutdown at present because of a shadow being cast.<br>
If, for the difference, a value above the shutdown difference is<br>
ascertained and if at the same time there is coincidence in the inputted<br>
time window, which takes account of the solar irradiation or the position of<br>
the sun, the wind power installation stops automatically if shadow-based<br>
shutdown is switched to 'on'. While the installation is stopped because of a<br>
shadow being cast, a corresponding status message appears in the main<br>
menu of the display device.<br><br>
The value of the shutdown difference can be altered by way of<br>
suitable inputs. As the shadow of the rotor blades becomes weaker with<br>
increasing distance in relation to the immission point and at some point<br>
loses significance entirely, the cast shadow still has an unfavourable effect<br>
with increasing distance only when a greater difference is involved. The<br>
shutdown difference must be set in accordance with local factors because<br>
the shutdown difference also depends on the geographical factors on the<br>
spot.<br>
The light conditions are also continually further measured after the<br>
installation stops. The wind power installation automatically starts again if<br>
the shutdown difference falls below its specified value for a duration of<br>
more than 2 minutes, preferably 10 minutes, or the shadow has moved (by<br>
virtue of a change in the position of the sun or because of the sun's path),<br>
to such an extent that there are no longer any adverse effects due to<br>
shadow casting at the im mission point.<br>
The times for the occurrence of shadow casting are edited for input<br>
by way of a menu. In that respect the values are composed of a beginning<br>
and an end date and a start and a stop time. Inputted values can be<br>
altered, expanded or erased at any time, which can be effected by means<br>
of manual input or by reading in a suitable program.<br>
The times in respect of the position of the sun are inputted in the<br>
format of Winter time. Leap years are also taken into account in the<br>
programming.<br>
The times for shadow-based shutdown can always be called up at the<br>
current time or afterwards by way of remote monitoring so that it is<br>
possible to provide proof in regard to compliance.<br>
A wind power installation for carrying out the foregoing method<br>
includes a data processing apparatus in which the positions of the sun or<br>
data representing same are stored. The wind power installation further<br>
includes a plurality of and preferably three light sensors. Those sensors are<br>
arranged in uniformly spaced relationship around the installation.<br>
With three sensors, there is thus a spacing of 120° between the<br>
respective sensors if they are arranged on a notional circle around the wind<br><br>
power installation. When using three sensors, one is always subjected to<br>
direct light incidence and at least one further sensor is arranged in a<br>
shadowed region. It is therefore always possible to ascertain the difference<br>
in light intensity.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter by means of<br>
an embodiment by way of example.<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of a wind power installation according to<br>
the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a simplified plan view on to a cross-section through<br>
the pylon above the light sensors,<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view illustrating the shadow casting effect at<br>
two different positions of the sun, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of the shadow casting effect also at two<br>
different positions of the sun.<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified side view of a wind power installation 1.<br>
That wind power installation 1 includes a pylon 10, at the head of<br>
which is arranged a pod 12 with rotor blades 14. Arranged at a<br>
predetermined height on the pylon 10 are sensors 16 which detect the light<br>
intensity. Arranging the sensors 16 at a predetermined height substantially<br>
prevents them from being the subject of malicious damage or manipulation.<br>
In that respect the height can be so selected that the sensors 16 can<br>
be reached at reasonable cost in order for example to be able to clean them<br>
or also replace them. It will be appreciated that it is also possible to provide<br>
heating for the sensors 16 in order to prevent or eliminate icing thereof.<br>
As an alternative to mounting the sensors 16 on the pylon 10 of the<br>
wind power installation 1 it will be appreciated that the sensors 16 can also<br>
be mounted on separate masts (not shown) or other suitable devices.<br>
Figure 2 is a simplified view in cross-section through the pylon 10 of<br>
the wind power installation 1 above the sensors 16. It can be seen from<br>
this Figure that in this case three sensors 16 are preferably disposed at<br>
uniform spacings at the outer periphery of the pylon 10. The spacing<br>
between the sensors is therefore 120°.<br><br>
By virtue of the round cross-section of the pylon 10, one half of the<br>
peripheral surface of the pylon 10, that is to say a region of 180°, is always<br>
exposed to the direct incidence of light. Accordingly the other half of the<br>
peripheral surface (again 180°) will be in shadow. The use of at least three<br>
sensors therefore means that at least one is certain to be exposed to direct<br>
incidence of light and at least one is in shadow.<br>
Accordingly, at any desired moment in time, the light intensity when<br>
direct light irradiation is involved and the light intensity in shadow can be<br>
detected, and the difference thereof can be ascertained. That difference can<br>
be determined by the control system of the installation and used<br>
straightaway for control according to the invention of the wind power<br>
installation.<br>
Figure 3 shows a wind power installation, for example of type E-40<br>
from Enercon, which is at a given distance E from a house 2. That house 2<br>
can also be referred to as the immission point A.<br>
When the sun rises in the morning and also throughout the day in<br>
the Winter time, the sun only rises to a low height - always as viewed from<br>
the immission point A - so that when the sun is in position I the angle of<br>
incidence is pi.<br>
If the sun rises higher - position II of the sun - that involves a<br>
different angle of incidence βII of the rays of the sun. Those angles of<br>
incidence βI and βII (it is possible to envisage any other angles of<br>
incidence) of the rays of the sun also establish when in general a shadow<br>
can be cast directly at the immission point A.<br>
The scenario illustrated in Figure 3 is shown once again in Figure 4,<br>
from another perspective. When the sun is in the south east (once again<br>
considered from the immission point), the rays of the sun impinge on the<br>
wind power installation at an angle βI - in relation to the west-east axis - .<br>
As soon as the sun has travelled further in the direction of south, the<br>
rays of the sun are incident on the wind power installation 1 at another<br>
angle βII.<br>
It is only when the position of the sun which is a function of the<br>
geographical location on the Earth and the angles of incidence α and β<br><br>
provides that the shadow of the wind power installation is incident on the<br>
immission point A, that the wind power installation is shut down if the<br>
difference between light and shadow is above a predetermined value,<br>
namely the shutdown difference. The shutdown difference depends not only<br>
on the light incidence but also the distance in relation to the immission<br>
point. If a wind power installation is very close to the immission point in<br>
question, the cast shadow which occurs can be troublesome even with a<br>
slightly overcast sky. In such a situation therefore the wind power<br>
installation should acquire a lower value for the shutdown difference than<br>
for the situation where the immission point is further away from the wind<br>
power installation.<br>
If the difference is below the shutdown difference, the wind power<br>
installation - irrespective of the position of the sun - is not shut down and<br>
can still generate electrical energy. Such a situation occurs in particular<br>
when the sky is heavily clouded.<br>
The further away that a wind power installation is from the immission<br>
point, the correspondingly shorter are the times within which in general a<br>
shadow casting effect can occur at the immission point.<br>
The difference can be measured directly at the immission point A or<br>
at the wind power installation. As the immission point and the wind power<br>
installation are relatively close together, the light intensity values measured<br>
at the wind power installation are also valid for the immission point A.<br>
The difference itself can be measured for example with a plurality of<br>
light sensors whose values are processed by a data processing apparatus<br>
associated with the wind power installation. The positions of the sun at<br>
which shadow casting can occur at the immission point are also<br>
programmed in that data processing apparatus. It will be easily appreciated<br>
that those 'shadow-casting' positions of the sun are different for each wind<br>
power installation and therefore the data processing apparatus has stored,<br>
for each wind power installation, a different position of the sun at which a<br>
shadow can be cast.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible that, in the case of a<br>
wind farm arranged in the proximity of an immission point, where a shadow<br><br>
casting effect is to be avoided, this can be controlled by a central data<br>
processing apparatus which switches off a respective individual wind power<br>
installation of a wind farm when that installation causes a shadow to be<br>
cast at the immission point.<br>
If a shadow is cast, the wind power installation is not shut down<br>
immediately but only when the shadow has been cast over a certain period<br>
of time, for example between 5 and 10 minutes.<br>
If a shadow is no longer being cast, for example because clouds have<br>
come between the sun and the wind power installation, it is also possible to<br>
provide that the system does not switch on the wind power installation<br>
again immediately, but waits for a certain time, for example between 5 and<br>
10 minutes, and provides for switching on the wind power installation and<br>
for causing it to run again, only when the difference was below the<br>
shutdown difference within that period of time.<br>
It is also possible to program further positions of the sun for the wind<br>
power installation if that is necessary, besides shutdown positions of the<br>
sun which have already been programmed.<br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1. A wind power installation comprising a data processing apparatus which<br>
controls the wind power installation and in which are stored the positions of the<br>
sun or values representative in that respect, in respect of which shutdown of the<br>
installation can take place,<br>
characterized in that the wind power installation is coupled to at least<br>
three light sensors which are arranged uniformly spaced around the wind power<br>
installation and by means of which the respectively current intensity of light and<br>
shadow or the intensity of light and shadow ascertained over a certain time is<br>
measured, and that the data determined by the light sensors are processed by<br>
the data processing apparatus and shutdown of the wind power installation is<br>
effected if the difference between light and shadow is above a predetermined<br>
value when a predetermined position of the sun is assumed.<br>
2.	A wind power installation as claimed in claim 1 wherein, beyond the stored<br>
positions of the sun, fresh positions of the sun for further immission points can<br>
be stored, which is effected by means of suitable programming.<br>
3.	A wind farm having a plurality of wind power installations as claimed in<br>
one of the preceding claims.<br>
4.	A method of controlling a wind power installation, comprising the steps of:<br>
controlling the wind power installation by a data processing apparatus,<br>
storing predetermined positions of the sun or values representative of the<br>
predetermined positions of the sun in respect of which a shutdown of the wind<br>
power installation can take place,<br>
wherein at least three light sensors are arranged uniformly spaced around<br>
the wind power installation,<br>
measuring the respective current light intensity in a light receiving region<br>
and in a shadowed region or the respective light intensities in said regions<br>
ascertained over a certain time by means of the at least three light sensors,<br><br>
processing the data determined by the light sensors, and<br>
shutting down the wind power installation if the difference between the<br>
light intensity in said regions is above a predetermined value when a<br>
predetermined position of the sun is assumed.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in claim 4 which shuts down the wind power<br>
installation only at a predetermined position of the sun.<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein the wind power installation is at<br>
least temporarily shut down at a predetermined position of the sun.<br><br>
when planning ana setting up wind power installations the visual<br>
detractions to be expected on the part of the wind power installation on the<br>
environment play an increasingly important part in approval and<br>
acceptance. If for example a wind power installation is placed in the<br>
proximity of a residence, it is possible, when the sun is in unfavourable<br>
positions, that the wind power installation or the rotor thereof is between<br>
the sun and the residence. If the sunshine is not affected by cloud, the<br>
rotating rotor constantly throws a (strobing) shadow on to the property.<br>
The shadow casting caused by the wind power installation on the adjoining<br>
properties is often perceived by the residents as being very troublesome.<br>
Even if the wind power installation satisfies the legal approval requirements<br>
there is however not always any guarantee that the undesired shadow<br>
casting effect is prevented.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a wind power<br>
installation by means of which shadow casting regulation is improved.<br>
That is achieved by a method of operating a wind power installation<br>
wherein a first light intensity is detected in a region of direct light<br>
irradiation and a second light intensity is detected in a shadowed region,<br>
and wherein the wind power installation is shut down if the difference<br>
between the first light intensity and the second light intensity is greater<br>
than a predetermined value.</td>
