				<td>[Detailed Desciption of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a stand device in a two-wheeled motor vehicle, particularly to an advantageous structure for disposing a stand locking mechanism.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 69255/95 is disclosed a scooter wherein a vehicle body frame and an<br>
upper portion of a power unit are supported swingably through an engine hanger link and wherein a stand is rotatably supported below the power unit.<br>
In the said scooter, a vehicle body-side bracket is attached to a vehicle body frame, a main stand is supported rotatably by the vehicle body-side bracket, the bracket being formed in the shape of a box, and a stand locking mechanism is disposed in the said box.<br>
When the main stand is raised during parking, the stand locking mechanism locks the main stand in an unstowable manner for the purpose of preventing theft until predetermined regular procedures, for example turning ON of the main switch, is taken. Once such a regular procedure is taken, the stand locking mechanism unlocks the main stand, allowing it to be sprung up and stowed.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Unlike the above prior art, it is sometimes desired that the engine hanger link be disposed below the power unit. However, if the stand locking mechanism is to be adopted in such an arrangement, an increase in size of the vehicle body is unavoidable.<br>
The stand locking mechanism is required to have a guarded peripheral structure to make mischief difficult, that is, to make it difficult for anyone to insert his or her hand into the locking mechanism.  Usually, it is necessary to provide integrally or separately a cover member which covers the stand locking mechanism from above, such as, for example, forming the vehicle body-side bracket in a box shape as in the prior art referred to above.<br>
For meeting the above-requirement, however, it is necessary to provide a fairly thick structure for forming a space which surrounds the stand locking mechanism, and ensure, below such thick structure, a predetermined minimum height from the ground. Consequently, the engine mounting position becomes higher and it results in increasing in size of the vehicle body.<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a stand device which permits the provision of an engine hanger link below a power unit without causing an increase in size of a vehicle body.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an advantageous structure for disposing a stand<br>
locking mechanism.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
According to claim 1, for solving the above-mentioned problem, there is provided, in a two-wheeled motor vehicle having a vehicle body-side bracket attached to a vehicle body frame, a main stand supported rotatably by the vehicle body-side bracket, and an engine supported by the vehicle body-side bracket through an engine hanger link, a stand device including a stand locking mechanism for locking the main stand in -an unstowable manner, the stand locking mechanism being disposed in a space surrounded by both the vehicle body-side bracket and the engine hanger link.<br>
According to claim 2 there is provided, in a two-wheeled motor vehicle having a vehicle body-side bracket attached to a vehicle body frame, a main stand supported rotatably by the vehicle body-side bracket, and an engine supported by the vehicle body-side bracket through an engine hanger link, a stand device characterized in that the engine hanger link is provided with a fulcrum member and an engine support portion, the fulcrum member and the engine support portion being disposed in front and rear<br>
positions, respectively, with a main stand support portion therebetween, and further provided with connections for connection between the fulcrum member of the engine hanger link and the engine support portion, the said connections respectively having thick, solid member portions disposed inside the vehicle body-side bracket and outside a main stand-side bracket.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 3 there is provided, in combination with the stand device of claim 2, a stand device in a two-wheeled motor vehicle wherein a stand locking mechanism for locking the main stand in an unstowable manner is disposed in a space surrounded by both the vehicle body-side bracket and the engine hanger link.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 4 there is provided, in combination with the stand device of any of claims 1 to 3, a stand device in a two-wheeled motor vehicle wherein the engine hanger link is formed by casting or forging.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 1, since the stand locking mechanism is disposed in the space<br>
surrounded by both vehicle body-side bracket and engine hanger link, this surrounding arrangement can make mischief difficult for the stand locking mechanism. Besides, since the engine hanger link is utilized, it becomes unnecessary to form the vehicle body-side bracket in a box shape, and the cover so far provided integrally with or separately from the vehicle body-side bracket to cover the conventional stand locking mechanism from above can be eliminated.<br>
Consequently, below the engine, it is possible to dispose the engine hanger link and also dispose the stand locking mechanism, without increasing the size of the vehicle body. Reduction of weight can also be attained.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 2, since the fulcrum member of the engine hanger link and the engine support portion are disposed in front and rear positions, respectively, with the main stand support portion therebetween, these thick portions are displaced from each other in the longitudinal direction. As a result, even if the engine hanger link is disposed below the engine, it is not required to enlarge the vehicle body size in the vertical direction; besides, the body size in<br><br>
the longitudinal direction can be shortened.<br>
Moreover, the rigidity required for the engine hanger link is mostly satisfied by the thick, solid member portions of the connections.  Further, since the said solid member portions are disposed inside the vehicle body-side bracket and outside a main stand-side bracket, they can be prevented from interfering with those brackets. Consequently, it is possible to enhance the freedom of layout of the engine hanger link and ensure the required swing stroke.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 3, the stand locking mechanism can be disposed in the space defined by a combined structure of the engine hanger link and the vehicle body-side bracket, which permits the reduction of size in both vertical and longitudinal directions. Consequently, without increase in size of the vehicle body, the engine hanger link and the stand locking mechanism can be disposed below the engine.  It also becomes possible to attain the reduction of weight.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 4, since the engine hanger links are formed by casting or<br>
forging, they can be formed as thin and very strong links, thus contributing to the reduction in weight of the vehicle body. According to the present invention there is provided a stand device in a two-wheeled motor vehicle characterised in that a vehicle body-side bracket attached to a vehicle body frame, a main stand supported rotatably by said vehicle body-side bracket, and an engine supported by the vehicle-body side bracket through an engine hanger link, said stand device having a stand locking mechanism for locking said main stand in an unstowable manner, said stand locking mechanism being disposed in a space surrounded by both said vehicle body-side bracket and said engine hanger link (15).

First, in Fig. 2, a vehicle body frame, which supports a front wheel 1 and a rear wheel 2, comprises a main pipe 4 extending obliquely downward and backward from<br>
a handle stem 3, floor portions 5 extending substantially horizontally backward in a pair right and left from the lower end portion of the main pipe 4, and rear frame portions 6 extending obliquely upward contiguously from the rear ends of the floor portions 5.<br>
A fuel tank 7 is carried on the floor portions 5, while a container 8 having an internal volume large enough to accommodate a helmet therein is carried on the rear frame portions 6. An upper opening of the container 8 is covered with a seat 9 which can be opened and closed. A handle (not shown) for operating a main stand locking mechanism which will be described later may be provided within the container 8.<br>
Behind the container 8 are disposed an oil tank 10 and a battery 11.  The oil tank 10 is supported directly by the rear frame portions 6, and the battery 11 is also supported by the rear frame portions through the oil tank 10.<br>
The rear wheel 2 is supported by the rear end portion of a crank case 13 in a swing type power unit 12. The power unit 12 is of a known type in which an engine and<br>
a transmission mechanism are rendered integral with each other and in which the whole is supported to the vehicle body side vertically siwngably together with the rear wheel 2.<br>
The swing type power unit 12 is connected to an engine hanger link 15 through connections 14 which are projected from the front lower portion.  One end of the engine hanger link 15 is welded to the rear frame portions 6 and the other end thereof is supported swingably by a middle portion of a vehicle body-side bracket 16 extending backward.<br>
At the rear end portion of the vehicle body-side bracket 16 is supported a main stand 17 rotatably.  The numeral 18 denotes a shock absorber and the reference marks AC, CB and MF stand for an air cleaner, a carburettor, and a muffler, respectively.<br>
In Figs. 1, 3 and 4, the vehicle body-side bracket 16 is in the form of a vessel having an upper opening, and on its inside bottom is mounted a stand locking mechanism 20.  Further, the engine hanger link 15 is disposed so as to cover the stand locking mechanism 20 from above.<br>
The engine hanger link 15 and the vehicle body-side bracket 16 overlap each other vertically, with a mounting space 21 for the stand locking mechanism 20 being formed therebetween (Fig. 1).<br>
The engine hanger link 15 is connected to the vehicle body-side bracket 16 swingably at a fulcrum member 22, and at an engine support portion 23 located in the rear end position the engine hanger link is connected to the connections 14 of the swing type power unit 12 rotatably through a connecting shaft 23a.<br>
The rear end portion of the vehicle body-side bracket 16 is formed as a main stand support portion 25, which supports the main stand 17 through a mounting shaft to be described later.<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 5, 1, 3 and 8, the vehicle body-side bracket 16 is formed in the shape of a vessel having an upper opening, using a rigid material such as metal for example. A bottom 30 thereof is formed behind and below the rear frame portions 6.<br>
Right and left portions 32 of a front end 31 are welded to the rear frame portions 6 at the highest positions. At the left-hand front portion of the bottom 30 there is formed a cylindrical portion 33 which is open in the longitudinal direction.  Further, in the vicinity of the cylindrical portion 33 and on the central side of the vehicle body there is formed a mounting hole 34 for the stand locking mechanism 20, with a nut 27 being welded to the back thereof (Fig. 5).<br>
On both right and left sides of the bottom 30 are formed upright side walls 35, and mounting holes 35a for the fulcrum member 22 are formed in the side walls 35.<br>
The rear end portion of the bottom 30 is formed as the main stand support portion 25, which portion is constituted by an upright wall 36 which is generally turned U shaped in plan.  On the front side of the upright wall 36 is formed a slit 36a which is wide in the transverse direction, while in right and left side portions 36a are respectively formed mounting holes 36c for the main stand support portion 25.<br>
One of the right and left mounting holes 36c (the<br>
left one in this embodiment) is partially formed with an anti-dislodgment slit 36d which is cut in radially outwards. Further, on the front side of the upright wall 36 are formed upright side walls 37 extending forward at right and left positions.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4, 10 and 11, the stand locking mechanism 20 is provided with a lock plate 40 extending longitudinally and a cam member 41. The lock plate 40 has a mounting hole 42 formed in the front end thereof, also has a branched projection 43 at a middle portion thereof, and further has a mounting hole 44 formed in the rear end thereof.<br>
As is best seen in Fig. 10, the cam member 41 is fabricated by superimposing a cam plate 45 and a connecting member 46 one on the other vertically and uniting the two by welding.  Centrally of the cam member 41 is formed a through hole 47 in alignment with the mounting hole 44.<br>
The connecting member 46 is formed with two projecting portions 46a and 46b projecting radially outward. Between the tip of one projecting portion 46a and that of the branched projection 43 is mounted a return<br>
spring 48, whereby the cam member 41 is turned clockwise in the figure to urge the cam plate 45 pivotally in an unlocking direction.<br>
To the other projecting portion 46b is connected the rear end of a locking wire 49.  By pulling the locking wire 49 forward the cam member 41 is turned counterclockwise in the figure against the return spring 48 to lock the main stand 17 in an upright state.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7, 1-, 3 and 8, the engine hanger link is formed by casting or forging with use of, for example, a light alloy such as aluminum, or iron. At a middle portion of the link 15 is formed a thick pivot shaft support portion 50 in the transverse direction. The said middle portion is semiarcuate in section. At both end portions of the link 15 are formed cylindrical boss portions 51, with annular bushings 52 being respectively fitted in the boss portions 51.<br>
Inner tubes 52a of the right and left annular bushings 52 extend long toward the center of the vehicle body and are connected together at the central position (Fig. 8). A bolt 22a which constitutes the fulcrum member<br>
22 is passed through the thus-connected inner tubes and is clamped with a nut 22b.<br>
A stopper arm 53 is integrally projected forward from near the left-hand boss portion 51, with stopper rubber 54 being attached to the front end of the stopper arm 53. The stopper arm 53 with the stopper rubber 54 is inserted inside the cylindrical portion 33 (Figs. 7 and 1).<br>
Behind the pivot shaft support portion 50 is formed a cover portion 55.  The cover portion 55 is formed thin except both right and left sides where solid member portions 56 are formed.  The solid member portions 56 have a large wall thickness so as to satisfy most of the rigidity required. At the rear end of the cover portion 55 is formed a boss portion 57 which constitutes the engine support portion 23.<br>
As shown in Figs. 9, 1, 3, 4 and 11, the main stand 17 has a body portion 60 which is centrally bent in a substancially U shape and also has a generally turned U shaped stand-side bracket 61 welded to the said central bent portion.  In a front wall 62 of the stand-side bracket 61 is formed a locking hole 63 which comes into coincidence<br>
with the slit 36a of the upright wall 36 when the main stand 17 is raised into its upright position for parking.<br>
In this upright state of the main stand 17, the stand-side bracket 61 comes into abutment against the upright wall 36 and is stopped its rotation. Thus, the upright wall 36 serves as a stopper in the upright state of the main stand 17 (Fig. 11).<br>
Between right and left walls 64 of the stand-side bracket 61 is disposed a collar 65 in the transverse direction, and a slit 66 is formed axially in part of one end (the left-hand end in the vehicular advancing direction in this embodiment) of the collar 65.<br>
Further, a mounting portion 67 for a stand spring (not shown) is integrally projected from the portion where the bracket 61 is superimposed on the body portion 60.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the upright wall 36 and the main stand 17 are connected together by inserting both ends of the collar 65 between the right and left side portions 36b of the upright wall 36, making coincidence with the mounting holes 36c, and then passing a bolt-shaped mounting<br>
shaft 70 through both mounting holes 36c and collar 65 from the left-hand side in the vehicle advancing direction.<br>
In this state, a transverse hole 73 formed in the other end of the mounting shaft 70 projects outward from the rightmost end of the collar 65.  By inserting a pin 74 into the hole 73, dislodgment of the mounting shaft 70 is prevented.<br>
Mounting and removal of the mounting shaft 70 can be done only when the main stand 17 is sprung up into its stowed position. At this time, the anti-dislodgment slit 36d and the slit 66 coincide with each other.<br>
On the other hand, a projecting portion 72 is formed on the mounting shaft 70 radially outward at an inside position spaced from a head portion 71 of the shaft 70 by a distance corresponding to the wall thickness of the associated side portion 36b.  The projecting portion 72 passes through the anti-dislodgment slit 36d and enters the slit 66.<br>
When the main stand 17 is turned into its upright state, the slit 66 and the anti-dislodgment slit 36d are<br>
out of phase with each other, and the projecting portion 72 abuts the inside of the side portion 36b and becomes unremovable.<br>
The main stand 20 is assembled in the following manner.  First, as shown in Fig. 10, the stand locking mechanism 20 with the lock member 41 and lock plate 40 connected together beforehand by bolt 28 and nut 29 is put on the bottom 30 of the vehicle body-side bracket 16 so that the mounting hole 42 of the lock plate 40 is aligned with the mounting hole 34 of the bottom 30, followed by connection using bolt 26 and nut 29.<br>
Subsequently, the front half of the engine hanger link 15 is superimposed on the vehicle body-side bracket 16, and the front end portion of the stopper arm 53 is inserted inside the cylindrical portion 33 together with the stopper rubber 54 which has been mounted in advance. The right and left boss portions 51 are inserted inside the right and left side walls 35, making alignment with the mounting holes 35a, and the boss portions and the side walls are connected together using the bolt 22a which constitutes the fulcrum member 22 and also suing the nut 22b (Figs. 1, 3 and 8).<br>
Further, the boss portion 57 located at the rear end of the engine hanger link 15 is inserted between the paired right and left connections 14 provided on the underside of the power unit 12, followed by connection using the bolt 23a as a connecting shaft of the engine support portion 23 and also using a nut 23b (Fig. 3).<br>
In this way the fulcrum member 22 and the engine support portion 23 are distributed respectively in front and in the rear with the main -stand support portion 25 therebetween (Figs. 1 and 3).<br>
The solid member portions 56 of the engine hanger link 15 extend longitudinally between the side portions 36b of the vehicle body-side bracket 16 positioned outside in plan and the right and left walls 64 of the stand-side bracket 61 located inside (Fig. 3).<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described.  In the upright state of the main stand 17 for parking, as shown in Fig. 11, the locking hole 63 formed in the front wall 62 of the stand-side bracket 61 and the slit 36a formed in the upright wall 36 of the vehicle body-side<br>
bracket 16 are aligned with each other.<br>
When the locking wire 49 is pulled, for example by turning the handle in the container 8 in a locking direction, which container is opened and closed with a main switch (not shown), the cam plate 45 is fitted in both locking hole 63 and slit 36a, whereby the main stand 17 is locked so that it cannot be sprung up into its stowed state.<br>
If a predetermined regular procedure is taken, for example if the handle in the container 8 is turned in an unlocking direction, the locking wire 49 is released and the cam plate 45 is turned so as to become disengaged from the locking hole 63 by means of the return spring 48. As a result, the main stand 17 is unlocked.<br>
Thus, once the main stand 17 is locked into its upright state for parking, the main stand cannot be unlocked thereafter unless the above predetermined regular procedure is taken.  Since the main stand thus maintains the locked state so that, without the rider's approval, it cannot be sprung up for vehicular running, it is possible to prevent theft effectively.<br>
Besides, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the stand locking mechanism 20 is surrounded by the vehicle body-side bracket 16 both sideways and below, and is covered with the cover portion 55 of the engine hanger link 15 from above. Thus, it is difficult for anyone to put his or her hand into the interior from the exterior and do mischief against the stand locking mechanism 20.<br>
Since the cover portion 55 of the engine hanger link 15 also serves as the cover heretofore provided integrally with or separately from the vehicle body-side bracket in the prior art, it is possible to eliminate such special cover, whereby the simplification of structure and reduction of weight can be attained.<br>
Besides, since the stand locking mechanism 20 is disposed in the space 21 formed between the engine hanger link 15 and the vehicle body-side bracket 16, even the provision of the mechanism 20 does not cause a vertical expansion of the vehicle body size.  Consequently, even if there is adopted a structure in which the engine hanger link 15 is disposed below the swing type power unit 12, it is possible to prevent an increase in size of the vehicle<br><br>
body while ensuring a required minimum height from the ground.<br>
Moreover, since the fulcrum member 22 and the engine support portion 23 are disposed in front and rear positions, respectively, with the main stand support portion 25 therebetween, it is possible to minimize the vertical thickness of the vehicle body-side bracket 16. Thus, also according to this structure, it is possible to shorten the longitudinal size of the vehicle body without the need of increasing the vertical size thereof.<br>
Further, the cover portion 55 can be made highly rigid by the right and left solid member portions 56 and the front and rear, thick, pivot shaft support portion 50 and boss 57 of the engine support portion.  Therefore, the wall thickness of the cover portion 55 located at the middle portion can be made small, and by utilizing this thin-walled portion, it is possible to form the space 21 of a sufficient height.<br>
Further, since the right and left solid member portions 56 are passed between the stand-side bracket 61 located inside and the side portions 36b of the vehicle<br>
body-side bracket 16 located outside, the solid member portions 56, which are thick, can be disposed so as not to interfere with both brackets 16 and 61.<br>
As a result, it is possible to enhance the freedom of layout of the engine hanger link 15, ensure a required swing stroke, and make it difficult for anyone to insert his or her finger into the inside of the lock member 41 of the stand locking mechanism 20.<br>
Further, the stand locking mechanism 20 is disposed in the space 21 which is surrounded in front and in the rear by the pivot shaft support portion 50 and the upright wall 36 as well as the main stand-side bracket 61, right and left by the side walls 35, and up and down by the cover portion 55 and bottom 30.<br>
Therefore, even if both engine hanger link 15 and stand locking mechanism 20 are disposed below the power unit 12, the vehicle body size can be shortened in the longitudinal direction without enlarging it in the vertical direction in comparison with the case where the engine hanger link 15 and the vehicle body-side bracket 16 are simply arranged in the vertical direction, whereby the<br>
increase in size of the vehicle body can be avoided more certainly.<br>
Besides, the engine hanger link 15 can be formed thin and high in strength because it can be formed integrally by casting or forging. Also in this point it is possible to realize the reduction of weight.<br>
Additionally, since a removal preventing structure for the mounting shaft 70 is constituted using such an anti-dislodgment slit 36d as shown in Fig. 12, a more reliable anti-theft structure can be attained.<br>
