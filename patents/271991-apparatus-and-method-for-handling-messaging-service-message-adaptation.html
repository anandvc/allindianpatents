				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR HANDLING MESSAGING SERVICE<br>
MESSAGE ADAPTATION<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for handling<br>
messaging service message adaptation. More particularly, the present disclosure is<br>
directed to informing a multimedia message user when content of the multimedia<br>
message is adapted.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Presently, mobile communication devices are capable of sending multimedia<br>
service (MMS) messages. MMS messages can include combination of multimedia<br>
content such as audio, image and videos along with text. For example, one mobile<br>
communication device may send a MMS message to a second device. However, the<br>
second device may not be able to output, display, or otherwise handle the message.<br>
For example, a first device may send a video message to a second device. However,<br>
the second device may be, for example, an older cellular phone or a MMS capable<br>
client that is not capable of receiving large messages or is not capable of displaying a<br>
video message. In this case, after receiving the message from the first device and<br>
before forwarding it to the second device, a multimedia serving center (MMSC) can<br>
adapt the message so it can be output on the second device. For example, the MMSC<br>
can convert video into multiple of pictures for display on the second device.<br>
Alternately, the MMSC may remove the video and only send text associated with the<br>
message.<br>
Unfortunately, a user of the first device is not informed that the message was<br>
adapted. Furthermore, the second user has no method of viewing the important<br>
information removed from the message once it is modified or deleted. This can be<br>
especially problematic in mission critical situations where it is imperative that the<br>
user of the second device receives all information sent in the message. For example,<br>
the second user may be using a lower end cellular phone when traveling or when their<br>
primary cellular phone is in the shop. Yet, the first user may not be aware of the<br>
change and may send business imperative or emergency information to the second<br>
 <br>
user. However, neither user may be aware that the content was altered. Also, the<br>
second user is not able to receive the unaltered message.<br>
Thus, there is a need for an improved method and apparatus for handling<br>
messaging service message adaptation.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A method and apparatus for handling messaging service message adaptation.<br>
An original message is received from an originating communication device, the<br>
original message based on a wireless communication message protocol, the original<br>
message being of a first message type. The original message is modified according to<br>
preferences of a message recipient communication device to generate a second<br>
message of a second message type. The second message is sent to the message<br>
recipient communication device. The original message is sent to an alternate message<br>
recipient based on the original message being modified.<br>

Fig. 4 is an exemplary signal flow diagram of a system according to a related<br>
embodiment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 1 is an exemplary block diagram of a system 100 according to one<br>
embodiment. The system 100 can include a network controller 140, a network 110, a<br>
first terminal 120, and a second terminal 130. The system 100 can also include an<br>
alternate message recipient 160. The terminal 120 may be a message originating<br>
 <br>
communication device and the terminal 130 may be a message recipient<br>
communication device. For example, the terminals 120 and 130 and the alternate<br>
message recipient 160 may be wireless communication devices, such as wireless<br>
telephones, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, pagers, personal<br>
computers, selective call receivers, or any other device that is capable of sending and<br>
receiving messaging service messages on a network including wireless network.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the network controller 140 is connected to the<br>
network 110. The controller 140 may be located at a base station, at a radio network<br>
controller, or anywhere else on the network 110. The controller 140 can include a<br>
multimedia service center 142 and a transcoder 146. The multimedia service center<br>
142 can include a notification generation module 144. The multimedia service center<br>
142, the notification generation module 144, and the transcoder 146 are coupled to<br>
each other for sharing data, but may or may not be at the same physical location.<br>
The network 110 may include any type of network that is capable of sending<br>
and receiving signals, such as wireless signals. For example, the network 110 may<br>
include a wireless telecommunications network, a cellular telephone network, a Time<br>
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) network, a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) network, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), a satellite<br>
communications network, and other like communications systems. Furthermore, the<br>
network 110 may include more than one network and may include a plurality of<br>
different types of networks. Thus, the network 110 may include a plurality of data<br>
networks, a plurality of telecommunications networks, a combination of data and<br>
telecommunications networks and other like communication systems capable of<br>
sending and receiving communication signals.<br>
In operation, the multimedia service center 142 can receive an original<br>
message 150 from an originating communication device 120. The original message<br>
150 can be based on a wireless communication message protocol, the message being<br>
of a first message type. The wireless communication message protocol can be a<br>
wireless telecommunication message protocol, such as a cellular communication<br>
message protocol, such as a text messaging protocol, a short messaging service<br>
protocol, an enhanced messaging service protocol, a multimedia messaging service<br>
protocol, or the like. The transcoder 146 can modify the original message 150<br>
 <br>
according to preferences of a message recipient communication device 130 to<br>
generate a second message 155 of a second message type. Modifying the original<br>
message 150 can include transcoding the original message 150 based on a mismatch<br>
between the content of the original message 150 and the capabilities of the message<br>
recipient communication device 130. For example, transcoding the original message<br>
150 can include converting a video message to a multiple picture message, converting<br>
an embedded audio from one format to another format, deleting multimedia content<br>
from a multimedia message while retaining text in the original message 150, or any<br>
other transcoding method. Preferences of the message recipient communication<br>
device 130 may be capabilities of the recipient communication device 130. The<br>
multimedia service center 142 can send the second message 155 to the message<br>
recipient communication device 130 and send the original message 150 to an alternate<br>
message recipient 160 based on the original message 150 being modified.<br>
The multimedia service center 142 can also provide an option to the<br>
originating communication device 120 to have the original message 150 sent to the<br>
alternate message recipient 160 based on the original message 150 being modified.<br>
The multimedia service center 142 can additionally provide an option to the message<br>
recipient communication device 130 to have the original message 150 sent to the<br>
alternate message recipient 160 based on the original message 150 being modified.<br>
The original message 150 can be a multimedia messaging service message and the<br>
message recipient communication device 130 can be a cellular communication device.<br>
The alternate message recipient 160 can be based on an e-mail address, a telephone<br>
number, or any other means of indicating a message recipient. Thus, the alternate<br>
message recipient can be a device capable of handing the original message, such as a<br>
personal computer of a cellular phone with appropriate capabilities.<br>
The multimedia service center 142 can also send a message waiting<br>
notification to the message recipient communication device 130 and receive a<br>
retrieval message from the message recipient communication device 130, the retrieval<br>
message including information indicating the preferences of the message recipient<br>
communication device 130. The information indicating the preferences of the<br>
message recipient communication device can be directions to a preferences location,<br>
 <br>
the preferences location including preferences of the message recipient<br>
communication device 130.<br>
According to another related embodiment, the multimedia service center 142<br>
can receive an original message 150 from an originating communication device 120.<br>
The original message 150 can be based on a wireless communication message<br>
protocol and can be of a first message type. The multimedia service center 142 can<br>
send a message waiting notification to the message recipient communication device<br>
130 and receive a retrieval message from the message recipient communication<br>
device 130. The retrieval message can include information indicating the preferences<br>
of the message recipient communication device 130. For example, the information<br>
indicating the preferences of the message recipient communication device 130 can<br>
include directions to a preferences location, the preferences location including<br>
preferences of the message recipient communication device 130. The preferences of<br>
the message recipient communication device 130 can be capabilities of the message<br>
recipient communication device 130. The transcoder 146 can modify the original<br>
message 150 according to preferences of a message recipient communication device<br>
130 to generate a second message 155 of a second message type. The multimedia<br>
service center 142 can then send the second message 155 to the message recipient<br>
communication device 130. The modification notification generation module 144 can<br>
generate a modification notification 157 indicating that the original message was<br>
modified. The multimedia service center 144 can then send the modification<br>
notification 157 to the originating communication device 120. The modification<br>
notification 157 can include the second message 155 of the second message type.<br>
Alternately, the modification notification 157 can provide an option to retrieve the<br>
second message 155 of the second message type. The multimedia service center 142<br>
can send the second message 155 to the originating communication device 120 if a<br>
user of the originating communication device 120 exercises the option to retrieve the<br>
second message 155.<br>
The transcoder 146 can transcode the original message 150 based on a<br>
mismatch between the content of the original message 150 and the preferences of the<br>
message recipient communication device 130. For example, the transcoder 146 can<br>
transcode the original message 150 by converting a video message to a slideshow<br>
 <br>
message, by converting an audio format of a message attachment, by deleting<br>
multimedia content from a multimedia message while retaining text in the original<br>
message 150, or by any other useful modification.<br>
Thus, if a multimedia service center 142 performs severe content adaptation<br>
on a message for delivery to the recipient client 130, the sender 120 of the message<br>
can be informed about what happened to the message. Also, the recipient 130 of the<br>
message may have an option to receive the adapted message 155 on the mobile client<br>
130 and the un-adapted message 150 can be forwarded to an e-mail address, a mobile<br>
station international integrated services digital network number, a short code address,<br>
a universal resource locator, or any other useful address for retrieval on a terminal<br>
160 that can play the un-adapted message. Accordingly, the originator 120 can be<br>
informed of what was delivered and/or the recipient can retrieve the adapted message<br>
155 immediately and the original un-adapted message 150 can be viewed by the<br>
recipient in way of e-mail on a desktop-like or other compatible environment 160.<br>
Therefore, the message originator 120 can have a mechanism to be notified<br>
when the message 150 sent by that user has been severely adapted for the terminating<br>
messaging client 130. In addition, the originator 120 may request a copy of the<br>
message 155 that is being sent as a final message to the terminating party 130.<br>
Furthermore, the originator 120 may be provided with an alternate e-mail or other<br>
identifier for the recipient address 160. Also or alternately, the recipient 130 can have<br>
a mechanism that provides an alternate e-mail or other address 160 for the original<br>
message 150 to be forwarded to. The recipient 130 can get the adapted message 155<br>
on the messaging client and the un-adapted, original message 150, can be forwarded<br>
to an alternate delivery mechanism 160.<br>
Accordingly, this disclosure can provide a means for the sender 120 to know if<br>
the intended recipient 130 got the entire message or parts of the message was<br>
removed because of the end user terminal capabilities. This disclosure can also<br>
provide an opportunity for the recipient 130 to receive the un-adapted message 150<br>
via the alternate delivery mechanism 160. Thus, if a multimedia messaging service is<br>
used for business or some application where it may be important that all data is<br>
transmitted, when a message 150 is severely altered or parts of the data are removed,<br>
then it can be of utmost importance to inform the sender 120 of what was delivered<br>
 <br>
and what was not. For example, Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication<br>
phones may be open to these kind of problems or mishaps where user of high end<br>
phone may be borrowing a low end phone temporarily either from a service shop that<br>
is servicing the high end phone or when the user is just trying out a new phone with<br>
lesser capability while a message is sent to him that his phone is not capable of<br>
handling. For example a video message may be sent to a non-video handset. The<br>
present disclosure can allow a sender to be informed when the message has been<br>
adapted to allow it to be viewed on a device that is not compatible with the original<br>
message format. The present disclosure can also allow an un-adapted message to be<br>
sent to an alternate recipient that is capable of displaying the original message.<br>
Fig. 2 is an exemplary flowchart 200 illustrating the operation of the controller<br>
140 according to one embodiment. In step 210, the flowchart begins. In step 220, the<br>
controller 140 can receive an original message from an originating communication<br>
device. The original message can be based on a wireless communication message<br>
protocol and can be of a first message type. At this point, the controller 140 may send<br>
a message waiting notification to the message recipient communication device and<br>
receive a retrieval message from the message recipient communication device, the<br>
retrieval message including information indicating the preferences of the message<br>
recipient communication device. The information indicating the preferences of the<br>
message recipient communication device can include directions to a preferences<br>
location, the preferences location including preferences of the message recipient<br>
communication device. The preferences of the message recipient communication<br>
device can be capabilities of the recipient communication device.<br>
In step 230, the controller 140 can modify the original message according to<br>
preferences of a message recipient communication device to generate a second<br>
message of a second message type. The controller 140 can modify the original<br>
message by transcoding the original message based on a mismatch between the<br>
content of the original message and the preferences of the message recipient<br>
communication device. Transcoding the message for example, can include converting<br>
a video message to a multiple picture message, removal of video altogether,<br>
converting audio from one format to another, conversion of a high resolution media to<br>
a low resolution media, or any other method of transcoding a message. The controller<br>
 <br>
140 can provide an option to the originating communication device to have the<br>
original message sent to the alternate message recipient based on the original message<br>
being modified. The controller 140 may also provide an option to the message<br>
recipient communication device to have the original message sent to the alternate<br>
message recipient based on the original message being modified.<br>
In step 240, the controller 140 can send the second message to the message<br>
recipient communication device. In step 250, the controller can send the original<br>
message to an alternate message recipient based on the original message being<br>
modified. In step 260, the flowchart 200 can end.<br>
Fig. 3 is an exemplary flowchart 300 illustrating the operation of the controller<br>
140 according to another related embodiment. In step 310, the flowchart begins. In<br>
step 320, the controller 140 can receive an original message from an originating<br>
communication device, the original message based on a wireless communication<br>
message protocol and the original message being of a first message type. At this<br>
point, the controller 140 may send a message waiting notification to the message<br>
recipient communication device and receive a retrieval message from the message<br>
recipient communication device, the retrieval message including information<br>
indicating the preferences of the message recipient communication device. The<br>
information indicating the preferences of the message recipient communication device<br>
can include directions to a preferences location, the preferences location including<br>
preferences of the message recipient communication device. Preferences of the<br>
message recipient communication device can be capabilities of the recipient<br>
communication device.<br>
In step 330, the controller 140 can modify the original message according to<br>
preferences of a message recipient communication device to generate a second<br>
message of a second message type. The controller 140 can modify the original<br>
message by transcoding the original message based on a mismatch between the<br>
content of the original message and the preferences of the message recipient<br>
communication device. The controller 140 can transcode the message by converting a<br>
video message to a slideshow message, by converting an audio format of a message<br>
attachment, and/or by deleting multimedia content from a multimedia message while<br>
retaining text in the original message.<br>
 <br>
In step 340, the controller 140 can send the second message to the message<br>
recipient communication device. In step 350, the controller 140 can send a<br>
modification notification to the originating communication device, the modification<br>
notification indicating that the original message was modified. The modification<br>
notification can be the actual second message of the second message type.<br>
Alternately, the modification notification can include an option to retrieve the second<br>
message of the second message type. If the originating communication device<br>
exercises the option, the controller 140 can then send the second message to the<br>
originating communication device. In step 350, the flowchart 300 can end.<br>
Fig. 4 is an exemplary signal flow diagram of a system 400 according to<br>
another related embodiment. The system 400 can include a server 410, a first device<br>
420, a second device 430, a transcoder 440, and an alternate device 450. In step 462,<br>
the first device 420 can compose a message and send it to the server 410. In step 464,<br>
the server 410 can send a notification to the second device 430 notifying the second<br>
device 430 of the message waiting at the server 410. In step 466, the second device<br>
430 can send a response message for the retrieval of the message from the server 410.<br>
The response message can include information from the second device 430 regarding<br>
the capabilities of the second device 430. For example, the information may be a<br>
pointer that indicates an address or location where the server 410 can find the device<br>
information. As another example, the information may relate to the type of device or<br>
to user rules for the second device 430. The rules may be preferences for different<br>
types of messages desired at different times, different locations, or different devices<br>
used by the user. The server 410 may then determine a need for transcoding the<br>
message based on a mismatch between the content in the message and the<br>
capabilities, preferences, and/or rules relating to the second device 430. If<br>
transcoding is needed, in step 468 the transcoder 440 can adapt the message content<br>
to be compatible with the second device 430. If the message is transcoded, the server<br>
410 can determine an alternate delivery address. This alternate delivery address can<br>
be determined according to the user rules, determined from other information<br>
received from the first device 420, determined by querying the first device 420 for an<br>
alternate delivery address, determined by querying the second device 430 for an<br>
alternate delivery address, or determined by any other useful method for determining<br>
 <br>
an alternate delivery address. In step 470, the server 410 can send the transcoded<br>
message to the second device 430. In step 472, the second device 430 can send an<br>
acknowledgement to the server 410 that the transcoded message was received.<br>
In step 474, the server 410 can send a message to the first device 420<br>
indicating a transcoded message was delivered to the second device 430. In this step,<br>
the server 410 can send the transcoded message to the first device 420. In this step,<br>
the server 410 may also check with the first device 420 about rules regarding<br>
transcoded message delivery. For example, the server may check default rules of the<br>
first device 420 or may send an option to the user of the first device giving options for<br>
actions regarding delivery of a transcoded message. In step 476, the second device<br>
can send information to the server 410 regarding an action to take regarding the<br>
delivery of the transcoded message. For example, the server 410 may only send a<br>
notification to the first device 420 in step 474 and may only send the transcoded<br>
message back to the first device 420 if it is requested in step 476. In step 478, the<br>
server 410 can send the transcoded message to the first device 420. In step 480, the<br>
server 410 can send the transcoded message to the alternate device 450. The server<br>
410 may perform step 480 at any point after transcoding the message in step 440.<br>
The method of this disclosure is preferably implemented on a programmed<br>
processor. However, the controllers, flowcharts, and modules may also be<br>
implemented on a general purpose or special purpose computer, a programmed<br>
