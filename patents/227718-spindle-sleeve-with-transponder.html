				<td>The present invention relates to a  spindle sleeve with transponder.<br>
Field  of  the  Invention The     invention     relates     a     spindle      sleeve     having     a transponder,   and  more  particularly,   a   spindle   sleeve  having a   pocket   to   receive   a   transponder   wherein   the    transponder is  not  bound  to  the  pocket.<br>
Background  of  the  Invention<br>
Various spun materials, including glass fibers, are manufactured by a spinning process. As. the fibers are spun they are wound on a spindle. The spindle will generally comprise  a  cardboard  cylinder.<br>
It is necessary to the manufacturing process that<br>
certain information be marked on each spindle once the<br>
manufacturing	process	is	complete.	This	allows<br>
identification and tracking of the glass fiber on each spindle.<br>
Typically, the information is marked on each spindle optically for reading by a person, or with a bar code reader.<br>
Other non-optical means of marking and reading information are available. For example, transponders may be molded into a product. The transponder stores and transmits information as required by a user. The transponders are generally queried by an interrogator when the   stored  information  is  needed.<br>
Representative of the art is US 5,028,918 to Giles et al. (1991) which discloses a phase encoded transponder circuit   which   may   be    a   passive   device   capable   of   response<br>
to an interrogating signal and is capable of transmitting an   individual  unique   identification  code.<br>
Also representative of the art is EP 956537A1 to PAV Card GmbH which discloses a transmission module for contactless transmission of date between a ship and a reading  device.<br>
Also representative of the art is WO99/23024 to Wibmer GmbH which discloses a spool sleeve having interconnected layers, an inner layer fitted with a notch in. which a correspondingly formed transponder is embedded whose mass is at least approximately the same as that of the piece of strip that has been cut out So no imbalance between the sleeve  and  transponder   arises.<br>
However, the prior art transponders are molded into the product. As such, they are susceptible to mechanical damage caused by stresses transmitted to the transponder resulting from flexing of the product. Repeated flexing of the   transponder  during  use   results   in  premature   failure.<br>
What is needed is a spindle sleeve having means for<br>
electronically    processing     data.	What     is     needed     is     a<br>
spindle sleeve having a transponder for receiving and<br>
transmitting    data.	What    is    needed    is    a    spindle    sleeve<br>
having a sealable pocket for receiving a transponder. What<br>
is needed is a spindle sleeve having means for non-fixedly<br>
receiving    a     transponder.	What    is     needed    is     a    spindle<br>
sleeve having a sealable pocket located radially outward from tensile cords to minimize transmitted stresses. The present  invention  meets   these  needs.<br>
Summary  of   the   Invention<br>
The primary aspect of the invention is to provide a spindle sleeve having means for electronically processing data.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a spindle sleeve having a transponder for receiving and transmitting  data.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a spindle sleeve having a sealable pocket for receiving a transponder.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a spindle sleeve having means for non-fixedly receiving a transponder.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a spindle sleeve having a sealable pocket located radially outward from tensile cords to minimize transmitted stresses.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will be pointed out or made obvious by the following description of the invention and  the   accompanying  drawings.<br>
The invention comprises a transponder moveably implanted into a pocket on an elastomeric spindle sleeve. The pocket comprises a plastic lining which is formed in the sleeve during cure or vulcanization. The transponder is inserted into the pocket once cure or vulcanization of the sleeve is complete. The open ends of the pocket are then sealed closed with an adhesive. Since the transponder is not molded into  or otherwise bonded to the pocket during fabrication the transponder may move within the pocket. This minimizes stresses that may otherwise be transmitted to the transponder during flexing of the sleeve, thereby extending    a    transponder    life.        The    transponder    collects,<br>
stores and transmits manufacturing data which can be read by handheld or stationary electronic devices. The transponder comprises a microchip and antenna in addition to a plastic or paper laminate upon which it is mounted. The transponder is activated by RF energy received by the antenna and therefore needs no battery.<br>
The present invention relates to a spindle sleeve with transponder comprising an elastomeric product and a transponder circuit having a processor and signal antenna for interaction with a remote electrical device, the improvement comprising:<br>
the elastomeric product having a receivable portion cured therein; the transponder circuit sealed into said receiving portion; and wherein the receiving portion has a peice that binds to an elastomeric on a single side during a vulcanization process.<br>

The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and form a part of the specification, illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention, and together with a description, serve to explain the ' principles of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the transponder in a sleeve pocket. The transponder 200 comprises a microprocessor 201 connected to a coil antenna 202. The transponder and antenna are sealed into a pocket 101 formed in elastomeric sleeve .100. The sleeve is then used, for example,   on  a   spinning  machine.<br>
Sleeve 100 is fabricated in a manner known in the elastomeric belt fabricating art, namely, successive layers of  elastomeric   are  built   up  on   a   build  mandrel    (not   shown)  .<br>
During fabrication, a single piece 102 of polyester plastic<br>
is placed between elastomeric layers. Piece 102 may also<br>
comprise a woven or non-woven material depending on the<br>
temperature during use. Tensile cords are also wound on<br>
the sleeve build, see Fig. 4. The sleeve is fabricated<br>
with tensile cords wound in a longitudinal direction in<br>
order to resist the centrifugal forces generated by the<br>
spinning    process.	The    sleeve    may    experience    rotational<br>
speeds    of    5000    RPM    or    greater.	The    tensile    cords    may<br>
comprise polyester, fiberglass, nylon 6.6, nylon 4.6, aramid, cotton and equivalent materials known in the art. The built-up belt is then cured or vulcanized by application of heat and pressure. The vulcanized slab may then  be  cut   into  individual   sleeves.<br>
Piece 102 is laminated between successive layers of<br>
elastomeric to form a void comprising a receiving portion<br>
or    pocket    101.	Piece    102    prevents    adjacent    elastomeric<br>
layers from bonding together across the piece. Piece 102<br>
is oriented radially outwardly of the tensile cords,<br>
between the tensile cords and an overcord elastomeric layer<br>
105, see Fig. 4. This prevents the transponder from being<br>
crushed between a spinner mandrel and the tensile cords<br>
when the sleeve is installed on a spinning machine, see<br>
Fig. 3. Piece 102 may comprise any non-metallic material<br>
that will bond on only a single side to the elastomeric<br>
during    cure    or    vulcanization.	This    assures    a    receiving<br>
pocket will be formed and maintained during vulcanization<br>
or cure without the layers of elastomeric bonding together.<br>
Further, piece 102 is non-metallic so as not to interfere<br>
with the RF signals received ' by or transmitted from the<br>
transponder     antenna.	Alternatively,     piece     102     may     be<br>
removed    from    the    sleeve    after    curing    or   vulcanization    in<br>
order to give the proper finished sleeve thickness t, see<br>
Fig.      4,      once      the     transponder      is      inserted.	Various<br>
thicknesses of piece 102 may be used to achieve a proper finished  sleeve  thickness.<br>
Alternatively, a portion of the elastomeric layer containing the pocket may be omitted during fabrication representing the thickness of the transponder plus piece 102 so that a proper uniform finished thickness about an entire circumference will be achieved when the transponder is   inserted  into  the  pocket.<br>
Once the vulcanization or cure is complete, the belt built is cut into the appropriate widths, each width having a pocket 101. Transponder 200 is inserted into pocket 101. Once the transponder is inserted, the open ends of the pocket 111 are sealed shut using any suitable adhesive such as   cyanacrylate   or  any  equivalents   thereof,   see   Fig.   4.<br>
Although the ends of the pocket are sealed closed, the transponder is not sealed to the pocket. Instead, the transponder is free to move about within the sealed pocket, minimizing or eliminating stresses otherwise transmitted to the transponder by flexing of the sleeve during removal from a spinning machine, or during removal from a glass coil.<br>
Fig.      2      is     a     plan     view     of     a     transponder.	The<br>
transponder 200 is a passive1 device without an internal power supply. The transponder receives a radio frequency (RF) or clock signal from an interrogator. It accumulates voltage through the coil antenna 202 from the input signal. The transponder uses the accumulated voltage from the interrogating signal to power the processor 201, which reads the memory and transmits the appropriate response back  to   the  interrogator.<br>
Transponders of the type described above are known in the art. For example, and not by way of limitation, a suitable transponder is manufactured by PAV Card GmbH, Germany. The specific product is PAV model no. 16A-MIR." The processor 201 and coil antenna 202 are laminated on a durable flexible plastic material 203. An overall thickness of the laminated transponder is less than 1mm. This form of transponder is extremely thin and wear resistant and is especially suitable to the application where sleeve overall thickness is limited to a maximum of approximately 3mm. This example is not offered by way of limitation as any equivalent transponder will perform as well. Material 203 is   non-metallic   so  as   not  to   interfere  with  RF  signals.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a spinning machine<br>
portion including an inventive sleeve. In use, the rubber<br>
sleeve containing the transponder is mounted in a spinning<br>
machine,      for     spinning     glass     fibers     for     example.	The<br>
spinning machine comprises a mandrel portion, shown in part<br>
in Fig. 3, upon which a coil is spun. The depiction of the<br>
mandrel portion M in Fig. 3 is an illustrative example and<br>
not offered as a limitation to a particular form or style<br>
of spinning machine. Mandrel projections M describe a<br>
generally      cylindrical      form.	The     mandrel     portion      is<br>
manipulated by a spinning machine in a manner known in the art. The inventive sleeve has a generally belt-like shape that  is  placed  over  the  mandrel  portion.<br>
The material is then spun onto the sleeve during fabrication.. Once the sleeve is loaded with a fiber coil, the mandrel portion M is collapsed inward and removed from an inner diameter of the sleeve. The coil remains on the flexible sleeve during handling and shipping. Once the coil    is   received   by   a   user   the   transponder   is    read.       Theflexible sleeve is folded inward upon itself and removed from the glass fiber coil. This results in a considerable savings over methods that require a spindle, such as a cardboard spindle, that must be dedicated to each coil of glass fibers and are discarded after a single, or very few uses. Unlike cardboard spindles, the inventive sleeve can then be reused by the manufacturer, the number of uses only limited  by  the  durability  of  the   sleeve   itself.<br>
In operation, prior 'to or during the spinning operation, the manufacturing information relating to the material wound upon the sleeve is determined by a user. The information is loaded into the transmitter. The transmitter then transmits the information to the transponder in the sleeve. The information is stored in the memory portion of the   transponder.<br>
An interrogator at the point of use queries the<br>
transponder in the sleeve. In response to the interrogator<br>
signal, the transponder transmits the information loaded<br>
during manufacture which is descriptive of the particular<br>
material    wound    on    the    sleeve.	The    transponder    is    read<br>
without use of any optical reader, such as one would use<br>
with      a     bar-code      reader.	As     noted,      the     transponder<br>
processor has a read/write capability that allows the sleeve   to  be  used  repeatedly.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the inventive<br>
sleeve     at     4-4     in     Fig.      5.	Transponder     200     is     shown<br>
contained in pocket 101. Pocket 101 is formed of piece 102 between elastomeric layer 105 and tensile cords 107. Elastomeric layer 108 comprises an undercord layer. The sleeve may have a toothed profile 109, see Fig. 5, to enhance engagement between the sleeve and a mandrel portion.       The   sleeve   may   also   omit   a   toothed   profile,    orhave    a    toothed    profile    on    a    side    opposite    that    shown    in Fig.   5.<br>
Although a single form of the invention has been described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that variations may be made in the construction and relation of parts without departing from the spirit and scope  of  the   invention  described  herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
