The Electronic Voting System of the present invention comprises of two parts, i.e. a control unit and a ballot unit, both units being connected by interconnecting cable. The said cable is a shielded cable, one end of which is permanently attached to the Ballot Unit. The other end is attached to a connector with a hood for connecting it to the Control Unit.<br>
The Control Unit controls the polling process and it consists of four sections: a. Display Section; b. Candidate Set Section; c. Result Section and, d. Ballot Section. The various sections of the control unit are controlled by the micro controller which has the program embedded therein. From the block diagram of the said control unit (see Fig. 4), it can be seen that the micro controller is connected to a memory module wherein the voting parameters and the voting data are recorded. The two memory modules help to record the above said data in 'duplicate'. The micro-controller is embedded with a set of instructions to carry out the various functions. The display interface having a printed circuit board is connected to the micro controller and this display interface helps to<br><br>
display on demand the total number of voters who cast their franchise, the votes polled for each candidate in each post and also display the operational and electrical error conditions, if any. The results are displayed in the removable 6 digit alphanumeric display panel (1 &amp; 2) provided in the control unit. Control switches represented by reference numeral 5 to 11 are connected to the said micro controller. The said control switches act as the input devices and will send the necessary request to the micro controller, which will process the requests and display the results in the display panel (1 &amp;2). The fimctions of the control switches are listed herein under:<br>
ON/OFF Switch: Reference Numeral 5: A toggle switch 5 to turn on/off battery power to Control Unit. The switch 5 is placed in the rear side of the control unit as shown in Fig. 1. Candidate set button: Reference Numeral 6: To set the number of posts, number of contesting candidates and number of votes for each post in conjunction with corresponding Ballot Unit (s). This button is placed in the Candidate Set Section B of the Control unit.<br>
Clear Button: Reference Numeral 7: To clear all the previously recorded voting data and set all the counts to zero. This is placed in the result section C of the control unit. Ballot Button: Reference Numeral 8: This switch is placed in the ballot section D of the control imit, to permit the voter to cast votes. This is similar to the issue of ballot paper in conventional voting.<br>
Total Button: Reference Numeral 9: To display the number of voters who have cast their votes. This switch is also placed in the ballot section of the control unit.<br>
Close Button: Reference Numeral 10: To close the polling operation after which no further votes are accepted.<br>
Result Button: Reference Numeral 11: To display sequentially the total votes polled for each candidate in all the posts<br><br>
The switches 10 and 11 are placed in the result section of the control unit.<br>
The Candidate Set Section B (Fig.l) houses a Power Pack compartment (15) and a "Cand Set* button (6). This section has a cover (Door III), which opens from left to right. On Opening its cover, by pressing the latch on the left hand side, the two compartments are seen. The Power Pack compartment is on the left side of the Candidate Set Section and is for fixing the Power Pack. The 'Cand Set' button compartment on the right side is covered with a flap 'f' which opens from left to right and can be sealed by thread seal. In this compartment a red 'Cand Set' (6) button is located. The Candidate Set Section can be closed and sealed by thread seal.<br>
The cover (Door II) of the Result Section 'C has an elliptical aperture 'api' on the left hand side through which the 'Close' button (10) is seen. The left portion of the Result Section houses a black 'Close' button (10). The right portion is actually an inner compartment with its own door (Door I).<br>
The door of the inner compartment has two elliptical apertures "ap ii &amp; ap iii". Through ap ii the button (11) marked 'Result' is seen. The inner door can be opened by inserting the thumb and a forefinger through these two apertures and then pressing the latches inwards and simultaneously pulling the cover upwards. Care should be taken to avoid any damage to this most vital compartment. On opening the door of the inner compartment, there will be seen on its inner side a frame around the two apertures for fixing Green Paper Seal. This will also reveal three sub sections with a yellow buttons marked 'Result' and a white 'Clear' button.<br>
In the Ballot Section 'D' there are two buttons - a grey 'Total' button (9) and a large blue 'Ballot' button (8), as can be seen in Fig.l, Two 9 pin D-type interface connectors 13 &amp; 14 are provided for connecting to Ballot Unit and to printer Interface.<br>
The bottom portion 16 of the Control Unit has also a compartment with a cover. This cover is hinged in the bottom and opens swinging downwards, when the latch in the middle is pressed downwards. This has a provision for thread sealing. The cover, when<br><br>
opened will reveal a plug on the left hand side for plugging the Interconnection cable from the Ballot Unit and a Tower' switch in the middle, for switching the EVS ON or OFF (Fig. 1)<br>
'ON' Lamp<br>
The green 'ON' Lamp (3) is located at the top left comer of the Display Section. When the Power switch is pushed upwards to the 'ON' position, the lamp glows to indicate that the EVS is ready for use.<br>
'BUSY' Lamp<br>
The red 'Busy' lamp (4) is located at right comer of the Display Section. It glows when the 'Ballot' button is pressed by the polling official to enable the voter to cast his vote. It goes off when the voter has cast his vote.<br>
Security Seal Mechanism<br>
•	The control switches are located in three different compartments, which can be sealed by thread and lac. This will prevent the un-authorized operation of these buttons either during of after polling.<br>
•	Security paper seal mechanism for result and clear compartment<br>
•	Thread/lac seal-mechanism.<br>
First seal for result and clear compartment.<br>
Second seal for composite 'close' button and result and clear compartments.<br>
Third seal for candidate set and battery compartment.<br>
The micro controller is also connected to a buzzer interface having a buzzer (Ref, Fig. 4). The Buzzer gives an aural indication when a voter exercises his/her franchise and also while displaying total votes polled for each candidate. The micro controller can be optionally connected to a printer interface for interfacing with a computer or for printing purposes.    The micro controller is also provided with an interface along with the<br><br>
necessary connector (see fig 2) to enable the connection between the Ballot Unit and Control Unit.<br>
The Ballot Unit is that unit of the machine, which the voter operates to exercise his franchise. It consists of a rectangular box. The box, which is as shown in fig.3, has -<br>
a.	Interconnecting Cable - 20 with connector pin 19<br>
b.	Ready Lamp-18<br>
c.	Slide Switch Panel - SL<br>
d.	16 Candidates' Buttons - marked 'a'<br>
e.	16 Candidates' Lamps with "arrow" mark and<br>
f.	Provision for insertion of Ballot paper containing the SI. Nos, Names and Election<br>
Symbols of contesting candidates under a transparent acrylic sheet (17) (Ballot<br>
Paper Screen).<br>
The interconnecting cable (20) is a shielded cable, one end of which is permanently attached to the Ballot Unit. To its other end is attached the connector with a hood (not shown) for connecting it to the Control Unit.<br>
The *Ready Lamp' (18) is on the top left side of the Ballot Unit. This green lamp glows when the 'Ballot' button on the Control Unit is pressed by the Presiding Officer to enable the voter to cast his vote(s). It goes off when the voter has cast his vote(s).<br>
The Slide Switch Panel 'SL' is on the top right side. The Slide Switch inside the Ballot Unit can be operated to set any one of the four positions viz., 1, 2, 3 or 4. When only one Ballot Unit is to be used, the Switch is to be set to 1. The Position of the switch is indicated through the transparent panel on the unit. If a second Ballot Unit is used, the Switch in that unit is set to position 2 and so on.<br><br>
The voter records his vote by pressing the Candidate's button against the name and symbol of the Candidate of his choice. When the Button is pressed, the red Lamp arrow mark (Candidate's lamp) on the left side of that button glows and the votes are recorded at the end of voting. The software has the flexibility of allowing the last candidate button in a ballot unit to be used for the end of the voting process of a voter.<br>
The Ballot Unit has a provision for inserting on its top face the Ballot Paper in which the SI. Nos., Names and Symbols of the contesting candidates are printed. A transparent acrylic sheet (17) (Ballot Paper Screen) protects the Ballot paper.<br>
The top cover of the Ballot Unit is opened by pressing simultaneously, towards the right, the latches at the top and bottom of the right edge of the Unit. The inside of the Unit is as in fig. 1. Sixteen Candidates' buttons are visible, each having an associated masking tab. The buttons that are required to be used should not be covered or masked. The buttons which are not required to be used should be covered or masked with their associated masking tabs.<br>
The housing is a multi part injection molded plastic cabinet with a cover (21). Special sliding mechanisms (not shown in the drawings) are provided for masking the xmused Vote Buttons.<br>
The block diagram of the ballot unit is shown in fig 5. As can be seen from fig 5, the microcontroller is the centre of the Ballot Unit having a set of instructions embedded therein. The same is connected to the visual indicator LEDs 1 to 16 represented by an arrow mark and candidate switches i.e. buttons 1 to 16 generally represented by reference numeral 'a' in fig. 3. It is further connected to a slide switch and the necessary connectors for power supply and for connecting to the control unit.<br>
SOFTWARE:<br>
The software is based on the flow chart given in Fig (6). After factory programmed, the system is in clear state with default parameters. Before an election, the input parameter<br><br>
for the election i.e. the number of posts, the number of contesting candidates and the number of votes are set with the candidate set key using the candidate buttons in the ballot units. The system is ready for use for voting. The Ballot key is pressed when each candidate has to vote. The Red Lamp on the Control Unit is an indication to the polling official of the readiness of the unit to accept a vote and the Ready Lamp on the Ballot Unit is an indication to the voter that the system is ready to accept a vote. Once the voter has exercised his franchise there is a visual and audio indication to the voter that his votes are recorded. The lamps on the Control Unit and Ballot Unit then go off. During the voting process, there is a feature for checking if any Ballot Keys is in a jammed condition or the interconnecting cable is disconnected/loose. The former gives a Pressed error message "P#" and later gives a Link error message "L#', where # indicates the Ballot Unit with the error condition. At the end of the poll the close button is pressed after which no further voting is allowed. The Result button is pressed for result display. If any key is pressed out of the above sequence, 'no' is displayed.<br>
The data is encoded and retained in redundant memory banks for the integrity of data. The data is verified for correctness in writing to memory. During computation of the result this data is read and compared from the memory banks before final display. In case of any error, the software also provides for display of voting data up to the instant prior to the error condition.<br>

By pressing the latches simultaneously, first slightly towards right and then pushing them downwards, the Ballot Paper Screen will become free for opening on the upper side of the said top cover. While opening the screen care should be taken to ensure that it is not damaged.<br><br>
FIXING OF BALLOT PAPER<br>
Place the Ballot P^er in the space provided for the purpose on the upper side of the top cover. Align the Ballot paper properly so that each candidate's name and his symbol are in line with the corresponding Candidate's lamp and button. After ensuring this alignment, close and press fit the Ballot Paper Screen to secure the Ballot Paper firmly underneath that screen.<br>
After the Ballot Paper has been firmly fixed and the Ballot Paper Screen has been pressed fit on the upper side of the Top Cover, the screen is to be sealed on the inner side of the Top Cover. This is to be done by passing the thread through the two holes on the screen specially provided for the purpose and by putting the thread seal on the prescribed address tag showing the particulars of the election with the seal of the Returning Officer.<br>
MASKING OF CANDIDATES' BUTTONS<br>
If the number of Candidates on the ballot paper is less than 16, the white masking tabs should be moved onto the Candidates' buttons not required to be used.<br>
SETTING OF SLIDE SWITCH<br>
Inside the Ballot Unit on the top right side, there is a Slide Switch, which has four positions 1,2,3 and 4. If only one Ballot Unit is to be used, set this Switch to the position marked * 1'. If two Ballot Units are to be used, set this Switch to the position marked ' 1' in the Ballot Unit which will be connected to the Control unit and set this Switch to the position marked *2' in the second Ballot Unit which will be connected to the first Ballot unit. If three Ballot Units are to be used, the Slide Switch will be set to the position marked *3' in the third Ballot Unit which will be connected to the second Ballot unit and so on. The first Ballot Unit will have the names of candidates from positions 1 to 16 of the ballot paper and the second Ballot Unit will have the names of contesting candidates from positions 17 to 32 of the ballot paper and so on.<br><br><br>
Close the Ballot Unit by bringing the top cover back to its original position. Pass two threads, one through the three holes at the top and the other through the three holes at the bottom provided for the purpose and seal each thread with Returning Officer's seal.<br>

a)	Connect the Ballot Unit to the Control Unit by plugging the connector of the Interconnecting Cable in the plug in that compartment. As the connector and the plug are multi-pin connectors, it will need some practice to plug them properly. The connector goes into the socket only one way, which can be found out easily by looking at the orientation of the pins and Top' of the hood. As the pins are delicate, do not force the connector in such a way as it may damage or bend the pins. The EVS will work only when this connection is made properly.<br>
b)	After plugging the connector properly, push the Tower' switch to 'ON' position. It will give a beep sound and the green "ON" lamp on the Display Section of the Control Unit will glow.<br>
c)	After the *0N' lamp glows, press the 'Cand Set' button in the Candidate Set Section. There upon the 2 digit Display Panel in the Display Section will now flash the letters 'nP' and the 4 digit Display Panel will flash *- -'.<br>
d)	When the letters 'nP', '- -' start flashing on the Display Panels on the Control Unit, press the Candidate's button in Ballot Unit corresponding to the number of posts. For example, if there are 4 posts, press the 4* candidate's button. Depending on the number of posts, the system next prompts for the first and last contesting candidate position for each post sequentially by flashing "F# - - " followed by "L# - - " , where " # " varies from 1 to the number of posts. The values for these two displays are entered using the ballot keys corresponding to the first and last candidates on the ballot paper for each post " # ". Finally the votes for each post is prompted by the system and the corresponding data entered using the ballot key in a maimer similar to that of setting the number of posts.<br>
e) Switch OFF the EVS by pushing the "Power" switch downwards to OFF position and discoimect the Interconnecting Cable from the Control Unit. For this purpose, the spring type clips on both sides of the connector hood should be pressed inward simultaneously and then the connector pulled out. Then close the cover of the bottom compartment of the Control Unit.<br><br>
SEALING THE 'CAND SET' BUTTON COMPARTMENT<br>
Close the flap which houses the Cand Set button and pass a thread through the two holes provided on the left side and seal with the seal of the Returning Officer. While sealing take care that direct flame does not come in contact with the Control Unit and molten wax does not fall on any part of the Control Unit.<br>
SEALING THE CANDIDATE SET SECTION.<br>
Close the Candidate Set Section. Pass a thread through the two holes provided on the left side and seal with the seal of the Returning Officer. While sealing take care that direct flame does not come in contact with the Control Unit and molten wax does not fall on any part of the Control Unit.<br>
Put back the Ballot Unit and the Control Unit in their respective carrying cases. They are ready for transportation to the Polling Station.<br>
On the day of Election, the presiding Office shall make the following preparations:<br>
The Ballot Unit will be checked to see if the Ballot Paper is properly fixed in place and that the two seals are intact.<br>
In the Control Unit, the presiding officer will check if the Candidate Set Section is intact and then connect the Ballot Unit to the Control Unit by plugging the connector of the interconnecting cable, put the Tower' switch to 'ON' position and then close the bottom compartment. Then open the 'Result' Section in the Control Unit and press the 'Clear' button to set all coimts to 'ZERO'. This takes about fourteen seconds and the buzzer is 'ON' during the clearing process.<br>
On completion of the clearing process, the display panel will start displaying that all counts are set to 'ZERO' sequentially (i.e. one by one, the display panel will show the total number of posts followed by the total votes polled for each candidate in each post).<br><br>
If need be the presiding officer will conduct a "MOCK POLL" in the presence of some polling agents &amp; others.<br>
During the actual poll, the 'Result Section' should be sealed using special security paper serially numbered. This paper seal has to be firmly fixed in the inner cover frame of the Result Section. A thin cardboard padding may be provided. The seal should be so fixed that its green surface is seen through the apertures from the outer side. Here is also a provision for making a thread seal on the left side of the inner door. After this, the outer cover of the Result Section has to be pressed for closing this section.<br>
PROCEDURE DURING POLL<br>
The Poll shall commence at the hour fixed for such commencement. Press the Total' button and ensure that the total voters who polled is zero. After all procedural requirements relating to identification of voter, application of indelible ink on his forefinger and obtaining his signature/thumb impression in the Register of Voters have been completed with regard to the first voter, the voter concemed has to be allowed for recording his vote. For that purpose, press the 'Ballot' button on Ballot Section of the Control Unit which would make the Ballot Unit ready for recording of the vote by that voter as has been explained herein above. Repeat that procedure every time the next voter is to be allowed to record his vote. It should be ensured that only one voter goes inside the voting compartment to vote. Special care should be taken to ensure that a voter goes in that compartment in the same order in which his Name is entered in the 'Register of Voters.' Also ensure that the Ballot button is pressed only when the earlier voter has come out of the voting compartment. At any time, if the total number of voters who polled has to be ascertained, 'Total' button should be pressed. The Display panel will then show the total number of voters who polled till that time. Please remember that the Total' button is to be pressed only when the 'Busy' lamp is OFF.<br>
After the close of the poll, the close button will be pressed. When this button is pressed the display panel will show the total number of voters who cast their franchise during the day.<br><br>
On the day of counting, after making the necessary checks, the Result button in the Control Unit is pressed to start the Result computation process. On completion of the result computation process, the total number of candidates, the total number of votes and the total number of votes cast for each candidate for each post will be displayed in the 'Display Panel' sequentially.<br>
Uniqueness of the invention:<br>
CONTROL UNIT:<br>
The software for setting the number of contesting candidates works in a imique way and provides a simple and efficient method to set the machine to accept the number of posts, the number of contesting candidates and the number of votes and in each post.<br>
The 'display on demand' provision in the control unit greatly reduces the power requirements for the machine and at the same time provides adequate time for the viewer to take note of the displayed data.<br>
The software, which detects the presence of ballot units, works in a unique way. When the ballot key is pressed and is a valid key, the software periodically checks for the presence of the ballot unit and gives a clear audio-visual indication (Link Error) regarding the error condition if the ballot unit is discoimected.<br>
The provision in software for reading back the vote data as soon as it is written in the memory provides a unique way of continuously checking the memory retention as well as functioning and leads to "so far so good" type of working. Error at any time during the poll is immediately detected and further polling is stopped. The votes recorded till then are secure and the result of the poll thus far conducted can be seen at the time of counting. Poll can be continued with a new system.<br>
The software for the detection of pressed error condition works in a unique way to detect the jammed buttons on the ballot unit. Under this error condition, the control unit display P followed by the number of the ballot unit in error condition.<br><br>
The provision to include an error-checking bit with the recording of each vote inside the memory greatly enhances the reliability of the recorded data.<br>
The provision to record the votes cast by a voter in "DUPLICATE" inside the control unit helps in computing and displaying the result of the poll in a more reliable fashion. This feature also provides for adequate redundancy of data storage.<br>
The unique software inside the control unit provides for a sequence looking for the<br>
control buttons - ballot, close, result, clear and Cand Set in such a way that<br>
i)        Contesting Candidate setting data cannot be changed unless the machine is in the<br>
condition, ii)       Votes cannot be cast on the machine unless it is in the cleared condition, iii)      Votes cannot be added to the machine once it is closed (by pressing the close<br>
button), iv)      Result cannot be seen unless the machine is closed (by pressing the close button) v)       The machine caimot be cleared (by pressing the clear button) unless the result is<br>
seen at least once.<br>
The interlocking feature built into the software in the control unit, which requires the connection of ballot unit for the clear operation to commence, prevents accidental erasure of voting data.<br>
The control unit has the unique feature of retaining the voting data without the need for applying any power.<br>
The control unit can retain, securely, the voting data without any power connection for up to 10 years.<br>
The control unit can be switched off safely at any stage of operation and still continue to work satisfactorily after reapplying the power.<br><br>
BALLOT UNIT:<br>
The mechanical blocking tabs provided in the ballot unit to block the unused candidate buttons with color identical to that of the body of the ballot unit removes any confusion in the minds of the voter regarding the actual candidate buttons in use. This also prevents votes being cast on buttons not in use.<br>
The software in the control unit for scanning the candidate keys in the ballot unit works in a unique way such that only the buttons of those candidates who are in poll are scanned Rest of the buttons as well as boxes if coimected is ignored.<br>
No invalid vote can be cast on the voting machine.<br>
The hardware daisy chaining provision implemented in the ballot unit prevents wrong connection of the ballot units when more than one ballot unit is used (As in the case where the number of contesting candidates is more than 16), The control unit always detects any error in the sequential connection of the ballot units at the appropriate time and an error message is flashed and further operation stopped. This prevents wrongly registering of votes on the machine.<br>
The locking pins, provided under the transparent ballot paper screen on the Ballot unit, prevent the movement of the ballot paper placed under the screen.<br>
No part inside the machine requires periodic reconditioning or replacement.<br>
The system has the unique feature of providing for a maximum of eight posts and the maximum number of contesting candidates depends on the number of ballot buttons blocked on the ballot paper for identifying the post. So for four groups, the number of contesting candidates could be sixty (64 - 4).<br>
The cabinet designs for both the control unit and the ballot unit provide for adequate interlocking of the required functions/keys.<br><br>
The carrying cases provided separately for the control unit and the ballot units provide for easy transport of the machines and also enable them to be carried over rugged terrain without causing any damage to the units.<br><br><br><br><br>
