				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a device for loop spinning or twisting comprising a<br>
substantially vertical spindle and a balloon limiter arranged coaxially to the spindle for<br>
feeding the yarn to a tube mounted on the rotating spindle.<br>
State of the Art<br>
The device mentioned above is one of the variants of a device for loop<br>
spinning or twisting according to Patent Specification EP 883703 B. The balloon<br>
limiter, which takes the form of a one-piece tube and is provided with an enlargement<br>
at its lower end, is in this case rotatably mounted and is driven in operation in the<br>
same sense as the spindle. In operation, the yarn being forwarded is forced by<br>
centrifugal force to travel along its inner surface from which, under the effect of the<br>
winding tension, it passes directly to the sleeve mounted on the rotating spindle. As a<br>
result of the rotation of the balloon limiter and the spindle, the yarn is forced to rotate<br>
around the longitudinal axis of the spindle, so that in transfer from the inner surface of<br>
the balloon limiter to the sleeve it forms a rotating open loop which rotates<br>
immediately below the lower end of the balloon limiter, this end also being referred to<br>
as the exit end, the loop controlling the yarn tension in a manner similar to the<br>
traveller of a ring spinning or ring twisting device. In order to maintain the open<br>
rotating loop continuously at an advantageously lower rate of revolutions than the<br>
spindle, its rotation should be braked. According to the above-mentioned patent<br>
specification, this is achieved, for example, by means of a non-movable limiting wall<br>
for limiting the size of the open loop in the radial direction, this wall enclosing and<br>
partially overlapping the exit end of the balloon limiter with a predetermined spacing,<br>
the reversing bend of the rotating open loop coming into contact with the wall, and/or<br>
by means of a guide edge for the yarn being wound, the edge also being non-<br>
movable and being arranged underneath the balloon limiter around the longitudinal<br>
axis of the spindle, the lower leg of the rotating open loop coming into contact with<br>
the guide edge in travelling to the sleeve.<br>
On devices of this kind it is possible to produce quality yarns with high speed.<br>
However, increased friction between the rotating open loop and the limiting wall has<br>
to be taken into account; this can lead even to mutual damage. For several kinds of<br>
yarn, in particular those made of thermoplastic fibres this fact can however represent<br>
a limitation, which has not yet been fully overcome even with the use of a limiting wall<br>
having a low-friction surface extending away from the longitudinal axis of the spindle<br>
from the region of first contact with the yarn in the direction to the lower end (EP 933<br>
454): Furthermore it has proved to be the case that any contact between the<br>
reversible bend of the rotating open loop and the limiting wall unfavourably increases<br>
the yarn tension. During braking of the rotating open loop by means of a guide edge<br>
arranged under the balloon limiter and affecting the lower leg of the rotating open<br>
loop, it must also be expected that relative rotation occurs between the guide edge<br>
and the reciprocating spindle causing regularly repeating changes in the magnitude<br>
of the wrap of the yarn on the guide edge and a consequent variation in the yarn<br>
tension. Even if this variation in tension is not large, it can, in many cases, especially<br>
in production of finer yarns, cause damage and thus limit the range of use of this<br>
device. If a guide edge is used alone for braking the rotating open loop, then not only<br>
the above-mentioned tension variations have to be expected, but also that at high<br>
working speeds a corresponding centrifugal force arising between the balloon limiter<br><br>
and the guide edge that brakes the yarn can cause an unacceptable increase in the<br>
radial extent of the rotating open loop and consequent unclesired drawing of the yarn.<br>
In this case also, there are limitations that affect several yarns.<br>
Essence of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to design the above-described device in such a<br>
way that it enables production of quality yarn at high operating speed without the<br>
above-mentioned limitations.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in that the balloon<br>
limiter comprises an upper portion drivable in the same sense of rotation as the<br>
spindle, and a non-rotatable lower part adjoining the upper part without contact, the<br>
lower part having a guide surface for the yarn starting at its inner face and ending at<br>
its lower end face.<br>
As a result of this arrangement a completely freely rotating loop is created<br>
immediately below the non-rotatable part of the balloon limiter, the rotation of this<br>
loop being braked in an expedient manner by means of a guide surface on the non-<br>
rotatable part of the balloon limiter and the loop thereby being able to control the yarn<br>
tension all by itself. The braking effect of the guide surface on the non-rotatable lower<br>
part of the balloon limiter is also positive in that - in combination with the winding<br>
tension - the required functional size of the rotating open loop is maintained in the<br>
radial direction so that no other measures are needed for this purpose. On this<br>
device, therefore, various kinds of yarn can be produced at the present time without<br>
the previously unavoidable limitations. Furthermore, it has been established that non-<br>
rotatable lower part of the balloon limiter, these yarns exhibit a better arrangement of<br>
the outer fibres so that the yarns are of higher quality, especially as regards<br>
hairiness.<br>
It has also proved to be the case, that the working speed can be increased still<br>
further because in the rotatable upper part of the balloon limiter, in comparison to the<br>
earlier one-piece balloon limiter, the radial loading is lower, such that the component<br>
of centrifugal force, which in the case of the one-piece balloon limiter acts by way of<br>
the rotating open loop with full weight on the exit end thereby tending to shift this exit<br>
end from the longitudinal axis, is now taken up at least in part by the non-rotatable<br>
lower part of the balloon limiter.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are set out in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
Description of the figures of the accompanying drawings<br>
Embodiments of the invention are represented schematically in the attached<br>
drawings. In Fig. 1 an embodiment of the device according to the invention is<br>
illustrated I side view, Fig. 2 shows a part taken from Fig. 1 and in Figure 3 a partial<br>
view of another example of the device according to the invention is shown.<br><br>
Description of the embodiments<br>
In Fig. 1 only one of the devices for loop spinning or twisting is shown. In a<br>
corresponding machine a large number of such devices can be provided as operating<br>
positions on one or on each longitudinal side. These devices comprise a drafting<br>
arrangement for the fibre sliver or roving, or a feed device for multiple thread ends<br>
depending whether the device is for loop spinning or loop twisting. From the<br>
viewpoint of the invention these devices each comprise a feed device 1 for the fibre<br>
material 2 to be spun or twisted. The spindle 4 with the sleeve 5 and yarn package 6<br>
is arranged vertically below the feed device 1, which in Fig. 1 is shown as a pair of<br>
delivery rolls 3; there is also a balloon limiter 7 for feeding the yarn P to the sleeve 5<br>
on the rotating spindle 4 Between the feed device 1 and the balloon limiter 7 there is<br>
a yarn guide 8 for directing the yarn P into the longitudinal axis of the balloon limiter 7<br>
or spindle 4. In another example (not illustrated) of an embodiment of the invention,<br>
the feed device itself can be used for directing the yarn in this way, being so<br>
arranged, for example, for this purpose that the lower delivery roll takes the place of<br>
the yarn guide thereby replacing it completely.<br>
The spindle 4 is formed as a rotor of an electric motor mounted on a spindle<br>
bank 11. The spindle bank 11 extends over all operating positions of the machine<br>
and, for the purpose of building a new yarn package 6, is provided with the usual<br>
program-controlled drive (not illustrated) for its rising and falling movements in the<br>
direction of the double-headed arrow 12. Alternatively, the spindle can, of course,<br>
also be mounted rotatably in a known manner in a similar spindle bank, the rotation<br>
being derived from a tangential belt, which also extends over all operating positions<br>
of the machine (not shown).<br>
The balloon limiter 7 consists of an upper part 13 and a lower part 14 adjoining<br>
the upper part without contact. The upper part has, for example, the form of a bell or<br>
bottle, providing a continuous surface 15 for contact with the yarn P and widening<br>
conically in a direction towards the exit end 16. The convergent, part of the side of the<br>
entry end 17 forms a shaft 18 by means of which this part is rotatably mounted in a<br>
bearing block 19 and is driven by an asynchronous electric motor 20. The bearing<br>
block 19 and the motor 20 are arranged in a housing, which is secured to the carrier<br>
rail 21 as will be disclosed in greater detail below. The carrier rail 21 extends over all<br>
operating positions of the machine, as does the spindle bank 11, but differs from the<br>
spindle bank 11 in that it does not move.<br>
The lower part 14 of the balloon limiter 7 (see Fig. 2) has the form of a ring 26<br>
and is associated with the exit end 16 of the upper part 13 at its end face. This part<br>
14 has a rotational guide surface 22 for the yarn P, starting on its inner face and<br>
ending on its lower end face. In this embodiment the guide surface 22 is alternatively<br>
curved in the direction of the longitudinal axis 9 of the balloon limiter 7 or the spindle<br>
4, the smallest diameter A - measured in the plane at right angles to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the balloon limiter 7 or spindle 4 - being smaller than the largest diameter B of<br>
the inner surface 15 of the upper part of the balloon limiter 7. The guide surface 22<br>
has the form of a stepless curve, but if necessary it can take another form, e.g. as a<br>
part of the outer surface of a foldable capsule. The whole lower part 14 of the balloon<br>
limiter 7, or at least that part thereof that comes into with the yarn, can be made out<br>
of commercially available tool steel, either by machining or by precision moulding, or<br><br>
by swaging with subsequent fine polishing of the guide surface 22. For the purpose<br>
of increasing operating life, at least the guide surface 22 could be made out of a<br>
material especially resistant to wear, e. g. technical ceramic.<br>
For the purpose of maintaining a fixed positional relationship between the<br>
upper part 13 and the lower part 14 of the balloon limiter 7 (Fig. 1), the lower part 14<br>
is mounted within a holder 23, for example, by means of a screw fastening or also by<br>
means of a clamp connection described below by reference to Figure 3 etc. The<br>
holder encloses the balloon limiter 7 like a tube, that is both its upper part 13 and its<br>
lower part 14, and is secured at its upper end to the carrier rail 21, this holder also<br>
forming the housing of the bearing block 19 and the motor 20 in the upper part 13 of<br>
the balloon limiter 7.<br>
In operation, the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter 7 is driven in the same<br>
sense as the spindle 4 with the winding sleeve 5 and the yarn package 6 (Fig. 1 and<br>
2). The yarn P, which is fed to the sleeve 5 or to the yarn package on this sleeve 5 by<br>
way of the balloon limiter 7, is forced because of the centrifugal force to travel first<br>
along the internal surface 15 of the rotating upper part 13 of the balloon limiter 7,<br>
thereafter being guided along the guide surface 22 of its non-rotatable lower part 14<br>
directly to the sleeve 5 or onto the package. As a result of the rotation of the upper<br>
part 13 of the balloon limiter 7 and the spindle 4 the yarn P is forced to rotate also<br>
around the longitudinal axis 9 of the spindle 4, so that in passing from the lower part<br>
14 of the balloon limiter 7 onto the sleeve 5 or the yarn package 6 it forms a rotating<br>
open loop Ps, which rotates immediately below the lower part 14 of the balloon limiter<br>
(Fig. 2). Because the open loop Ps is completely free it controls the yarn tension<br>
itself, so that in reaction to the changes in the diameter of the yarn package 6 the<br>
magnitude of the tension changes in the radial direction, and thus also the magnitude<br>
of the centrifugal force acting thereon. The centrifugal force acting on the rotating<br>
open loop Ps supports also in a useful manner the movement of the yarn P over the<br>
guide surface 22 of the non-rotatable parti 4 of the balloon limiter 7. At the same<br>
time, this guide surface 22 also acts as a brake on the rotating open loop Ps so that<br>
by this means also the rotating open loop Ps is braked in its rotation around the<br>
longitudinal axis 9 of the balloon limiter 7 and spindle 4 in such manner that its speed<br>
of rotation is advantageously lower than the speed of rotation of the spindle 4. The<br>
braking effect of the guide surface 22 does not have to be particularly large because<br>
for the required reduction of speed of the rotation of the rotating open loop Ps it<br>
suffices if only a small portion of the kinetic energy is absorbed by friction on the<br>
guide surface 22. Furthermore, by this kind of braking, in combination with the<br>
winding tension, the functional size of the rotating open loop Ps is maintained in the<br>
radial direction. During winding on the sleeve 5, the yarn P is guided along the sleeve<br>
5 onto the yarn package 6 by means of the usual program controlled up and down<br>
movement of the spindle bank 11 in the direction of the double-headed arrow 12 .<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the smallest diameter A of the guide surface 22<br>
of the lower part 14 of the balloon limiter 7 is smaller than the largest diameter B of<br>
the inner surface 15 of the upper part of the balloon limiter 7. Due to this, the<br>
component of the centrifugal force acting on the rotating open loop Ps on the side of<br>
the balloon limiter 7 is taken up by the non-rotatable lower part 14 of the balloon<br><br>
limiter 7, and the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter 7, which is subject to only slight<br>
radial loading, manages with a power input which is sufficient to maintain the given<br>
operating speed. Since the upper part 13 of the balloon linniter 7 is also not subjected<br>
at its exit end 16 to strong friction from the yarn P, this part 13 can be made of a very<br>
light material, which is less resistant to wear from the yarn, e. g. Duraluminium, or of<br>
a suitable technical plastics material, which is comparatively cheap and easy to work.<br>
A design of this type gives lower mass of the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter 7<br>
and improves its dynamic performance insofar as its harmonic frequencies are<br>
shifted to higher operating rates of revolution.The bearing block 19, in which the shaft<br>
18 of the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter is mounted, is then only loaded by the<br>
mass of its own rotating body; this is advantageous from the point of view of its<br>
lifespan.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is partially illustrated in Fig. 3, where it is<br>
assumed that the other elements not shown in Fig. 3 are identical with the elements<br>
shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the lower part 14a of the balloon limiter 7 takes<br>
the form of a part of a cylindrical tube, this part 14a coaxially enclosing and partially<br>
overlapping the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter with a spacing that enables free<br>
movement. This part 14a also has a guide surface 22a similar to the lower part 14 of<br>
the balloon limiter according to Fig. 1 and 2. However, the guide surface 22a begins<br>
on the inner face as an internal cylindrical surface and ends on the lower end face as<br>
an adjoining rounded end of the tube. This part 14a is movably mounted in a holder<br>
23a, which, as regards its design, corresponds to the holder 23 for the lower part 14<br>
of the balloon limiter according to Fig. 1. The only difference lies in the fact that its<br>
lower end carrying the the lower part 14a of the balloon limiter 7 is formed al an<br>
elongated, slotted clamping sleeve with radially projecting end brackets 24 to enable<br>
drawing together by means of a screw 25 or another known tightening element.<br>
Of course, the holder 23 carrying the lower part 14 according to Fig. 1 can also<br>
be arranged in the same way. In any event, the possible arrangements and kinds of<br>
fixing for the lower part 14, 14a of the balloon limiter 7 in the holder 23, 23a are not<br>
thereby exhausted. It is important in each case to find a mode which ensures a fixed<br>
positional relationship between the lower and upper part of the balloon limiter 7 and<br>
at the same time enables both exchange of one lower part of the balloon limiter for<br>
another, which, for example, is adapted to another kind of yarn or yarn fineness, and<br>
also axial setting of the exit end 26, 26a of the lower part 14, 14a of the balloon<br>
limiter 7 relative to the exit end 16 of the upper part 13 of the balloon limiter 7 so far<br>
as this is necessary.<br><br>
