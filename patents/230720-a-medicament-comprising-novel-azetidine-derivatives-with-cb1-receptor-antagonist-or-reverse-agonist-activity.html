AZETIDINECARBOXAMIDE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CB1<br>
RECEPTOR MEDIATED DISORDERS<br>
The present invention relates primarily to the use of azetidine-1-carboxamides in the treatment of disorders mediated by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, particularly to the treatment of obesity and other eating disorders associated with excessive food intake.<br>
It has been recognised that obesity is a disease process influenced by environmental factors in which the traditional weight loss methods of dieting and exercise need to be supplemented by therapeutic products (S. Parker, "Obesity: Trends and Treatments", Scrip Reports, PJB Publications Ltd, 1996).<br>
Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally determined on the basis of their body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by height squared (m2). Thus, the units of BMI are kg/m2 and it is possible to calculate the BMI range associated with minimum mortality in each decade of life. Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m2, and obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. There are problems with this definition in that it does not take into account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to fat (adipose tissue). To account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of body fat content: greater than 25% and 30% in males and females, respectively.<br>
As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of causes that is independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases with obesity are cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease.<br>
Compounds marketed as anti-obesity agents include Orlistat (Reductil®) and Sibutramine. Orlistat (a lipase inhibitor) inhibits fat absorption directly and tends to produce a high incidence of unpleasant (though relatively harmless) side-effects such as diarrhoea. Sibutramine (a mixed 5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. The serotonin releaser/reuptake inhibitors fenfluramine<br><br>
(Pondimin®) and dexfenfluramine (Redux™) have been reported to decrease food intake and body weight over a prolonged period (greater than 6 months). However, both products were withdrawn after reports of preliminary evidence of heart valve abnormalities associated with their use. There is therefore a need for the development of a safer anti-obesity agent.<br>
There now exists extensive pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the use of CBi receptor antagonists / inverse agonists for the treatment of obesity.<br>
Preparations of marijuana (Cannabis sativa) have been used for over 5000 years for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana has been identified as A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC), one of a member of over 60 related cannabinoid compounds isolated from this plant It has been demonstrated that A9-THC exerts its effects via agonist interaction with cannabinoid (CB) receptors. So far, two cannabinoid receptor subtypes have been characterised (CB1 and CB2). The CB1 receptor subtype is found predominantly in the central nervous system, and to a lesser extent in the peripheral nervous system and various peripheral organs. The CB2 receptor subtype is found predominantly in lymphoid tissues and cells. To date, three endogenous agonists (endocannabinoids) have been identified which interact with both CBi and CB2 receptors (anandamide, 2-arachidonyl glycerol and noladin ether).<br>
Genetically obese rats and mice exhibit markedly elevated endocannabinoid levels in brain regions associated with ingestive behaviour (Di Marzo et al. 2001 Nature 410: 822 - 825). Furthermore, increased levels of endocannabinoids are observed upon the fasting of normal, lean animals (Kirkham et al., British Journal of Pharmacology 2002, 136(4) 550-557). Exogenous application of endocannabinoids leads to the same physiological effects observed with A9-THC treatment, including appetite stimulation (Jamshida et al, British Journal of Pharmacology 2001,134: 1151-1154), analgesia, hypolocomotion, hypothermia, and catalepsy.<br>
CBi (CBi"/_) and CB2 (CB{/') receptor knockout mice have been used to elucidate the specific role of the two cannabinoid receptor subtypes. Furthermore, for ligands such as A9-THC which act as agonists at both receptors, these mice have allowed identification of<br><br>
which receptor subtype is mediating specific physiological effects. CB{*\ but not CB2-/\ mice are resistant to the behavioural effects of agonists such as A9-THC. CB1-/- animals have also been shown to be resistant to both the body weight gain associated with chronic high fat diet exposure, and the appetite-stimulating effects of acute food deprivation.<br>
These findings suggest a clear role for both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists in increasing food intake and body weight via selective activation of the CB1 receptor subtype.<br>
The therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been extensively reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 1998, 8, 301-313; Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat 2000, 10, 1529-1538; Trends inPharm. Sci. 2000,21,218-224; Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2002,12(10), 1475-1489).<br>
At least one compound (SR-141716A) characterised as a CBi receptor antagonist / inverse agonist is known to be in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity.<br>
WO 00/15609, WO 01/64632, WO 01/64633 and WO 01/64634 disclose azetidine derivatives as CB1receptor antagonists. WO 02/28346 discloses the association of an azetidine derivative as a CB1 receptor antagonist, and sibutramine, for the treatment of<br>
obesity.<br>
There remains a medical need for low molecular weight CBi receptor antagonists / inverse agonists with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties making them suitable for use as pharmaceutical agents. There also remains a medical need for new treatments of disorders mediated by the CBi receptor, particularly eating disorders, and particularly obesity. The object of the present invention is to provide such pharmaceutical agents and treatments.<br>
It has now been found that certain azetidine-1-carboxamides show unexpected efficacy as anti-obesity agents. Compounds of this general formula were previously described in WO-A-99/37612 for the treatment of anxiety and epilepsy. These azetidine-1-carboxamides have been shown to selectively bind to the CBi receptor subtype with high affinity. Such compounds have been shown to dose-dependently block the effects of an exogenously<br><br>
applied cannabinoid receptor agonist {eg ? 9-THC) in mice. Furthermore, such compounds have been shown to reduce food intake and body weight gain in both rat and mouse models of feeding behaviour.<br><br>

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof,<br>
wherein at least one of R1 and R2 has a non-hydrogen substituent in the ortho-position(s)<br>

The active compounds of formula (I) are antagonists and/or inverse agonists at the cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor and are useful for the treatment, prevention and suppression of diseases mediated by the CBi receptor. The invention is concerned with the use of these compounds to selectively antagonise the CB1 receptor and, as such, in the treatment of obesity and other disorders.<br>

As used herein, the term "treatment" as used herein includes prophylactic treatment.<br>
As used herein, the term "prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug of the compound of formula (I). For example, the compound of formula (I) may be prepared in a prodrug form wherein a free -OH group is derivatised (for example, via an ester, amide or phosphate bond) with a suitable group (the group may contain, for example, an alky!, aryl, phosphate, sugar, amine, glycol, sulfonate or acid function) which is suitably labile so as it will be removed / cleaved (eg. by hydrolysis) to reveal the compound of formula (I) sometime after administration or when exposed to the desired biological environment.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula (I). Salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids and bases including inorganic and organic acids and bases. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, furnaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like. Particularly preferred are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric and methanesulfonic acids, and most particularly preferred is the methanesulfonate salt Acceptable base salts include alkali metal (e.g. sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metal (e.g. calcium, magnesium) and aluminium salts.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be used in combination with one or more additional drugs useful in the treatment of the disorders mentioned above, the components being in the same formulation or in separate formulations for administration simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to the reaction scheme (where P is a nitrogen protecting group). Rl, R2, and R3 are as previously described. The ether (IV) may be<br><br>
formed by reaction of the azetidinol (II) with a benzhydrol (III, X = OH) with removal of water (for example azeotropic removal of water under standard Dean-Stark conditions). The ether (IV) may also be formed by reaction of the azetidinol (II) with a benzhydryl group substituted with a suitable leaving-group (III, X = CI, Br, I, mesylate, tosylate) and a strong base such as sodium hydride. Formation of the azetidine (V) may be achieved by reaction of (IV) with a suitable nitrogen deprotection agent. For example, if P is a benzhydryl group, then deprotection may be carried out by treatment with 1-chloroethyl chloroformate followed by treatment with methanol. The deprotected azetidine (V) can be isolated directly as the hydrochloride salt or, upon basification, as the free-base. The urea (I) can be formed by reaction of azetidine (V) with an N-alkyl isocyanate, or an N-alkyl carbamoyl chloride and a base such as triethylamine or potassium carbonate. Alternatively, the urea may be prepared directly from the protected azetidine (IV) without isolation of the intermediate azetidine (V). For example, when P is a benzhydryl group, azetidine (IV) may be treated with phosgene followed by an amine, R3NH2, to give urea (I) directly. Azetidine (V) may also be converted to the corresponding carbamoyl chloride (VI) by treatment with, for example, triphosgene. This intermediate carbamoyl chloride (VI) may be reacted with an amine, R3NH2, to give the urea (I).<br><br><br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of the compound of formula (T) in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a method of making such a composition comprising combining an effective amount of the compound of fonnula (I) with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient<br>
To further increase efficacy, the composition may contain components such as dextrans or cyclodextrins or ether derivatives thereof, which aid stability and dispersion, and decrease metabolism of the active ingredient.<br>
For compositions in which the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises a cyclodextrin or an ether derivative thereof, the active ingredient is intimately mixed with an aqueous solution of the cyclodextrin or ether derivative thereof, with optional addition of further pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients before, during or after said mixing. The thus obtained solution is optionally lyophilized, and the lyophilized residue is optionally reconstituted with water.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the composition further comprises a buffer system, an isotonizing agent and water.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered in a form suitable for oral use, for example a tablet, capsule, aqueous or oily solution, suspension or emulsion; for topical use including transmucosal and transdermal use, for example a cream, ointment, gel, aqueous or oil solution or suspension, salve, patch or plaster; for nasal use, for a example a snuf£ nasal spray or nasal drops; for vaginal or rectal use, for example a suppository; for administration by inhalation, for example a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol; for sub-lingual or buccal use, for example a tablet or capsule; or for parenteral use (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), for example a sterile aqueous or oil solution or suspension. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients, using standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy. Preferably, the compound is administered orally.<br><br>
For oral administration, the compounds of formula (I) will generally be provided in the form of tablets or capsules or as an aqueous solution or suspension.<br>
Tablets for oral use may include the active ingredient mixed with pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Capsules for oral use include hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent, and soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be mixed with excipients, surfactants or solubilising agents such as Labrafil®, Labrasol® or Miglyol®, or appropriate mixtures thereof.<br>
For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, the compounds of formula (I) will generally be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Aqueous suspensions may include suspending agents such as cellulose derivatives, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and gum tragacanth, and a wetting agent such as lecithin. Suitable preservatives for aqueous suspensions include ethyl and n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate.<br>
It will be appreciated that the dosage levels used may vary over quite a wide range depending upon the compound used, the severity of the symptoms exhibited by the patient and the patient's body weight.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following pharmacological examples. It will be appreciated that the examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL Assay Procedures<br>
Binding to CBi receptors<br>
The binding of compounds of Formula I to recombinant human CBi receptors was determined in vitro by standard methods, with reference to the procedure described by Rinaldi-Carmona et al (Rinaldi-Carmona, M., Pialot, F., Congy, G, Redon, E., Barth, F., Bachy, A., Breliere, J. C, Soubre, P., LeFur, G., Life ScL 1996, 58(15), 1239-1247). Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells expressing recombinant hCBi receptors. Binding assays are performed in a total volume of 250 ^L, containing [3H]-SR-141716A (1 nM final concentration), membranes and test compound. Non-specific binding is determined using CP55,940 (10 \M). Serial dilutions are performed starting from test compounds as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. Compounds are tested over the concentration range 10"10 M to 10"5 M. Ki values are calculated from IC50 values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.<br>
The thus-determined activity of compounds of formula (I) is shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Blockade of A9-THC induced hypolocomotion in mice<br>
The in vivo activity of compounds of formula (1) was assayed for ability to antagonise the reduction in locomotor behaviour induced by acute systemic administration of A9-THC in male C57B1/6 mice. The procedure was as follows.<br>
Test compounds are assessed following acute oral or intraperitoneal administration at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Each study utilises a between-subjects design (typically n=8) and compares the effects of doses of the test agent to those of vehicle and a positive control.<br>
The route of test compound administration, drug volume and injection-test-interval are dependent upon the compounds used. 10 min before testing, a 3 mg/kg dose A9-THC (or vehicle) is administered to mice by the i.p. route. Automated boxes (AM-1052 activity monitors, Benwick Electronics, Linton Instrumentation) are used to record photocell beam breaks as a measure of locomotor activity. The light beams are arranged on a 7 by 4 matrix on a metal grid. 16 grids are connected in series and Perspex boxes, 20 (width) x 40 (length) x 20 (height) cm, with a flat perforated, Perspex lid are placed in each grid. Mice are placed singly in Perspex boxes and the recording of activity in all 16 boxes starts simultaneously. The mice are left undisturbed to explore the novel activity monitor boxes for 15 minutes while beam breaks are recorded.<br>
Locomotor activity data are subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with drug treatment as a between-subjects factor. A significant main effect is followed up by the performance of Dunnett's test in order to assess which treatment mean(s) are significantly different from the control mean. Significant differences between the vehicle / A9-THC group and Test compound / A9-THC groups are assessed by Newman-Keuls test. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica Software, Version 6.0 (Statsoft Inc.) and Microsoft Excel 7.0 (Microsoft Corp.).<br><br><br><br>
Regulation of feeding behaviour<br>
The in vivo activity of compounds of formula (1) was assayed for ability to regulate feeding behaviour by measuring food consumption in male food-deprived Lister-hooded rats as follows.<br>
Test compounds are assessed following acute administration. Each study utilises a between-subjects design (typically n=8) and compares the effects of doses of the test agent to those of vehicle and a positive control.<br>
The anorectic drug sibutramine, or the reference CBt receptor antagonist, SR141716A, normally serves as a positive control. The route of drug administration, drug volume and injection-test-interval are dependent upon the compounds used. The injection-test-interval is the time between dosing and food re-presentation. Typically, animals are fasted such that at the time of food re-presentation food has been withdrawn for an 18-hour period. Food consumption is assayed at pre-determined time points (typically 1, 2 and 4 hours after administration). Food intake data are subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with drug as a between-subjects factor. A significant main effect is followed up by the performance of Dunnett's test in order to assess which treatment mean(s) are significantly different from the control mean. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica Software, Version 6.0 (Statsoft Inc.) and Microsoft Excel 7.0 (Microsoft Corp.).<br>
The thus-determined activity of compounds of formula (I) is shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
