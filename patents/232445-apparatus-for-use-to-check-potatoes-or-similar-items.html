				<td>Title: Apparatus for use to check potatoes or similar iterns<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for use to check potatoes or similar items, said<br>
apparatus comprising a feeding device for advancing the potatoes in a plurality of<br>
rows, a conveying device adapted to receive the rows of potatoes from the feeding<br>
device and advancing them while maintaining the row structure, a camera with asso-<br>
ciated image processing means for recording and evaluating each individual potato<br>
on the conveying device, and a sorting device controlled by the image processing<br>
means, said sorting device being adapted to sort the potatoes.<br>
Background Art<br>
A known apparatus automatically checks potatoes in such a manner that they are<br>
sorted according to different criteria, such as size, presence of different types of fun-<br>
gal diseases, damages etc. Unacceptable potatoes can be discarded thereby.<br>
Until now, this procedure has been carried out using an apparatus, where the pota-,<br>
toes have been advanced in longitudinal direction by means of a feeding device in<br>
the form of a so-called vibration feeder to an endless belt, i.e. an endless.conveyor<br>
belt with rotating rollers, the axes of said rollers extending transversely to the ad-<br>
vance direction. Each of said rollers is provided with a plurality of circumferential<br>
grooves, the number of said grooves corresponding to the number of rows, said<br>
grooves being evenly spaced across each roller, seen in the axial direction thereof,<br>
and arranged with respect to each other from roller to roller in the advance direction<br>
of the conveyor belt in such a manner that they are mutually aligned so that the pota-<br>
toes can be advanced in. rows in the grooves, said potatoes being taken up individu-<br>
ally by two adjacent rollers. In general, potatoes have an oblong shape and will<br>
therefore arrange themselves with their longitudinal axes extending parallel to the<br>
axes of the rollers, while being rotated around the longitudinal axes thereof by the<br>
rotation of the rollers. During the continuous movement of the endless belt the pota-<br>
toes are conveyed to a position underneath a camera taking pictures of each individ-<br>
ual potato in a conventionally known manner, said pictures being sent to a conven-<br>
tionally known image processing means recording the condition of the potato in<br>
question. At the end of the endless belt, there is a sorting device which may be con-<br>
trolled by the image processing means, if desired, so that here the potatoes are de-<br>
posited in compartments depending on their condition.<br>
As the potatoes are usually only rotated substantially around the longitudinal axes<br>
thereof, the ends of the potatoes have a tendency to remain hidden from the camera<br>
arranged above. This applies in particular to the outermost ends of potatoes in the<br>
outermost rows on the endless belt. Thus, there is a risk of potatoes that should have<br>
been discarded being approved for sale.<br>
The described automatic sorting of potatoes has several advantages compared to<br>
manual sorting, as it has been found that using this method, fewer good potatoes are<br>
being discarded and fewer potatoes to be discarded are approved. This is due to the<br>
fact that manual sorting requires the operator in question to view each individual po-<br>
tato and make a quick judgement, which can be difficult to sustain over a longer pe-<br>
riod at an acceptable suitable speed.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an apparatus ensuring further improvements<br>
of the automatically functioning sorting.<br>
According to the invention, this is obtained by the apparatus of the aforementioned<br>
type characterized in that the conveying device comprises a plurality of substantially<br>
horizontal rollers, the axes of rotation of said rollers extending parallel to the ad-<br>
vance direction of the potatoes, that the rollers are rotatably mounted in a support<br>
frame and connected with a first driving device for rotating them, said rollers each<br>
independently being additionally displaceable in parallel forwards and backwards in<br>
a substantially straight line extending in a vertical plane, said plane comprising the<br>
axis of rotation of each roller, and inclining somewhat upwards, seen in the advance<br>
direction; and that the rollers are connected with a second driving device adapted to<br>
confer a reciprocating oscillating movement to each roller along said line.<br>
As a result, the potatoes are both rotated around their longitudinal axes extending<br>
parallel to the advance direction of the conveying devices in a controlled manner<br>
and moved forward with a mutual distance so that the front end and subsequently the<br>
rear end are visible to the camera. This is due to the fact that the rollers convey a<br>
variable load onto the potatoes because of the oscillating movement thereof, while<br>
the potatoes generally remain in abutment with the rollers. The second driving de-<br>
vice results in the rollers alternately being subjected to a forward and a backward<br>
force in a direction inclining upwards in the advance direction and forming an angle<br>
of approx. 10° with the horizontal axes of the rollers. Thus, an oscillating movement<br>
is conferred to the rollers in a substantially straight path in said direction. During the<br>
forward movement the rollers exert a force component directed against gravity on<br>
the potatoes, whereby the potatoes are pressed down against the rollers with in-<br>
creased force, resulting in the potatoes exerting an increased normal force on the<br>
rollers and thus increasing the ability of the rollers to rotate the potatoes. During the<br>
backward movement the rollers practically move in a direction away from the pota-<br>
toes, whereby the potatoes exert a decreased normal force on the rollers, and the<br>
rollers may slip with respect to the potatoes. Thus, the rollers move backwards with<br>
respect to the potatoes, i.e. they are pulled away from underneath the potatoes,<br>
whereby the potatoes execute a relative forward movement with respect to the roll-<br>
ers. Using a suitable automatic setting of the movement amplitude of the rollers with<br>
respect to the rotational speed of the rollers it is possible for a camera to record all<br>
surfaces of an individual potato during its passage thereunder. Thus, the image proc-<br>
essing means in question is able to perform a correct sorting of the potatoes, when<br>
they reach the sorting device, with greater accuracy.<br>
As a result of avoiding the use of devices to ensure an individual advance to the<br>
conveying means, the apparatus is also comparatively simple.<br>
According to the invention, the rollers may each independently be associated with<br>
second driving devices., thereby allowing for the possibility of balancing the convey-<br>
ing means by adjusting the oscillating driving devices to have mutually different<br>
phases, for example, so that they alternately are in opposite phase.<br>
According to the invention, the rollers may be provided with a high-friction surface,<br>
such as longitudinal notches, thus securing that a rotational movement is conferred<br>
also to round and smooth potatoes or other similar items, such as apples, as a result<br>
of the rotation of the rollers.<br>

and<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for sorting potatoes. The apparatus comprises a frame 1,<br>
carrying a feeding device designated with the general reference numeral 2. The feed-<br>
ing device 2 comprises a plurality of channels 3-10, whereof only a single one is<br>
shown in Fig. 2 for the sake of clarity. As is apparent from Fig. 2, each channel 3 is<br>
carried by a driving device 11, said driving device being adapted in a conventionally<br>
known manner to confer a vibrating effect to the associated channels 3-10 in such a<br>
manner that potatoes arranged in the channel are advanced in an advance direction<br>
shown by means of an arrow 12 in Fig. 2. A conveyor, weighing devices and dis-<br>
tributing devices (not shown) are associated with the feeding device 2, ensuring in a<br>
conventionally known manner that potatoes are delivered in an evenly distributed<br>
stream during the operation of the apparatus 1 in such a manner that the potatoes in<br>
the channels 3-10 are distributed in rows.<br>
In front of the feeding device 2, seen in advance direction 12, there is a conveying<br>
device designated with the general reference numeral 13. The conveying device<br>
comprises a plurality of rollers 14-24. As is apparent from Fig. 2 showing two roll-<br>
ers 14, 15 associated with the channel 3, the rollers 14-24 are rotatably mounted in<br>
pairs on a support frame 25. The axes of rotation of the rollers 14-24 extends sub-<br>
stantially horizontally, mutually parallel and parallel to the advance direction 12.<br>
The rollers 14-24 are arranged in such a manner with respect to the channels 3-10<br>
that the channels 3-10 each independently can deliver rows of potatoes to a groove<br>
between two adjacent rollers 14-24. The rollers 14-24 are therefore arranged with a<br>
mutual distance in such a manner that the potatoes in question do not fall through<br>
the gap between the rollers.<br>
The rollers 14-24 are fastened to their support frames 25 using support means ensur-<br>
ing that each roller 14 and 15 is displaceable forwards and backwards in the direc-<br>
tion shown by means of an arrow 26 in Fig. 3. Preferably, the direction has an incli-<br>
nation of 10° with respect to the horizontal, said arrow being inclined upwards in the<br>
advance direction 12. At the front end of each individual roller, seen in the advance<br>
6<br>
direction 12, a pivot 50 associated with the roller is fastened to one leg 51 of a U-<br>
profile 52. The U-profile 52 is connected to a U-profile 55 fastened to the frame 25<br>
by means of two parallel spring plates 53 and 54. At the opposite end, the corre-<br>
sponding pivot is connected to a fixed frame part 26, the front and rear end of which<br>
being connected to the support frame 25 by means of spring plates 57 and 58, re-<br>
spectively. The spring plates 57 and 58 are also parallel to each other. In connection<br>
with each roller a driving device 27 is fastened at the bottom side of the frame<br>
part 56. The driving device 27 is adapted to affect the rollers in such a manner as to<br>
confer an oscillating reciprocating movement to them. Because of the displaceable<br>
suspension of the rollers by means of the spring plates 53,54, 57 and 58, said move-<br>
ment occurs along a straight line 26.<br>
Such a displaceable mounting of the rollers may be achieved in other conventionally<br>
known manners, such as by means of guideways.<br>
Accordingly, the driving devices 27 are adapted to subject the rollers 14-24 to such<br>
an effect load that the potatoes present between the rollers 14-24 are applied forces<br>
with a relatively large component in the forward direction parallel to the advance di-<br>
rection 12 and a small component in upward direction perpendicular to the plane of<br>
the rotational axes of the rollers 14-24. Immediately afterwards the rollers 14-24 are<br>
affected in opposite direction. This has been found to confer a forward movement to<br>
the potatoes which again has been found to ensure a mutual distance of said pota-<br>
toes. Additionally, the rollers are connected to a driving device 29 by means of a<br>
belt drive designated with the reference numeral 30. The belt drive belongs to all<br>
rollers, which means that said rollers are rotated with the same rotational direction.<br>
Thus, a rotational movement is conferred to the potatoes between the rollers in such<br>
a manner that in general, they rotate around an axis extending parallel to the advance<br>
direction 12 while being advanced. The rotational movement of the potatoes is pro-<br>
moted, as described above, by means of the inclined forward and backward dis-<br>
placement of the rollers 14-24.<br>
Following the conveying device 13 having rollers 14-24, there is a sorting device,<br>
designated with the general reference numeral 31. The sorting device 31 is of a con-<br>
ventionally known type and, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1, consists of a<br>
flap 32-41 associated with each roller gap. By means of driving devices, the<br>
flaps 32-41 are each independently adapted to be adjustable in a desired position in<br>
such a manner that the potatoes leaving at the end of the rollers 14-24 are directed to<br>
a desired compartment (not shown). Additionally, above the conveying device 13,<br>
there are two cameras 42-43 arranged in a conventionally known manner, said cam-<br>
eras taking pictures of the advancing potatoes and allowing said pictures be proc-<br>
essed in image processing means (not shown) adapted to control the sorting de-<br>
vice 31 in such a manner that the individual flaps 32, 41 are brought into such a po-<br>
sition that each individual potato is directed to a compartment in accordance with its<br>
condition.<br>
Using the apparatus according to the invention, potatoes are advanced, as mentioned<br>
above, in rows by means of the individual channels 3-10, and subsequently ad-<br>
vanced further in the gaps between the rollers 14-24. The oscillating reciprocating<br>
movement of the rollers in combination with the rotational movement thereof means<br>
that the potatoes rotate around an axis substantially extending parallel to the advance<br>
direction 12 while being advanced in said direction. Thereby, both the front and rear<br>
ends of the potatoes as well as the other sides thereof are brought within the expo-<br>
sure area of the cameras 42 and 43. Using a suitable setting of the advance velocity<br>
of the feeding device ensures a suitable distance between the potatoes on the roll-<br>
ers 14-24. Thereby, the advance velocity of the feeding device is usually adjusted in<br>
such a manner that it is slower than the advance velocity of the rollers 14-24.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention each individual roller has a diameter of<br>
90 mm and a length of 630 mm and the number of rollers is eleven. The driving de-<br>
vices 27 and 28 associated with the respective rollers 14-24 are driven at a suitable<br>
setting in such manner that the total effect on the apparatus is balanced. For exam-<br>
ple, the oscillating driving devices 27 may alternate between being in phase opposi-<br>
tion across the advance direction. To promote the effect on the potatoes in such a<br>
manner that they rotate around an axis parallel to the advance direction 12, the sur-<br>
faces of the rollers may, as shown in Fig. 5, be provided with curved notches. It goes<br>
without saying, that the rollers may also be provided with another high-friction sur-<br>
face.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention has been described in connection with the<br>
advancement of potatoes. However, it may also be used for other items, such as ap-<br>
ples or carrots, having a surface to be evaluated by means of image processing<br>
means with associated cameras 42, 43.<br>
A vibrator of a conventionally know type or another device, such as a device based<br>
on a crankshaft mechanism, may be used as oscillating driving device.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. How-<br>
ever, many modifications can be carried out without thereby deviating from the<br>
scope of the invention. For example, the distance between the rollers 14-24 may be<br>
adjustable, and the number of rollers 14-24 with associated channels 3-10 may be<br>
different from the one illustrated and described.<br>
All rollers 14-24 may also be arranged on a common support frame with a common<br>
oscillating driving device. The feeding device may be any other feeding device than<br>
the one described, if only it is adapted to convey potatoes or similar items forward in<br>
rows.<br>
