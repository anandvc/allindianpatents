Device for a portable container<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for a portable bucket or some other similar container which includes a carrying handle.<br>
Previously disclosed is the design of containers intended for various purposes with a triangular peripheral form. Previously disclosed, for example, is a container intended for use in kitchens for serving drinks, which comprises a handle extending along one side of the container for its entire height. The advantage of this is that a long pouring pipe is obtained and also a long handle, which can be gripped with two hands if desired.<br>
Also previously disclosed through US, A, 5,062,542 is a triangular peripheral form for sealable containers with a view to being able to stack them together in a limited area. The peripheral form in this case is equilateral, with three sides arranged relative to one another at a relative angle of 60°. If they are placed on a load pallet, for example, the entire surface of the pallet is not covered due to the absence of packaging, at least at the corners of the load pallet. This previously disclosed container lacks a carrying handle.<br>
Also previously disclosed is the design of buckets with either oval or rhomboid form, in conjunction with which the carrying handle is positioned at the two corners or sides of the bucket which are situated furthest away from one another. The handle in this case is situated so that it extends over the centre of the bucket with the same distance to the sides of the bucket. Although the width of the bucket has been reduced, it is still quite wide and it can be difficult to carry, especially for persons who are not so tall and who do not have long, ape-like arms.<br><br>
The principal object of the present invention is thus, in the first instance, to make available an arrangement which solves the aforementioned problems associated with carrying and stacking the containers in question simply and effectively.<br>
The aforementioned objects are achieved by means of an arrangement in accordance with the present invention, which is characterized essentially in that the bucket exhibits triangular cross-sectional form, in that the angle between the two shortest sides of the bucket is essentially a right angle, and in that the handle is arranged in such a way that the effective carrying point for the bucket is situated in a vertical plane located at a point ca. 1/3 across the width of the bucket between the longest side of the bucket and the right angle closest to the aforementioned longest side of the bucket.<br>
The invention is described below as a number of preferred illustrative embodiments, in conjunction with which reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the invention in its effective carrying position by a person;<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of a carrying handle with the handle respectively in the illustrated carrying position and in the rest position;<br>
Fig. 3 shows the principle for positioning the carrying handle;<br>

Fig. 17A shows a side view of loaded pallets with round buckets and triangular buckets in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 18 shows a cross-sectional view of a triangular bucket in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig, 19 shows a suspended triangular bucket; and<br>
Figs. 20 and 21 show the modular construction of the system.<br>
An arrangement 1 for a portable bucket 2 of the kind shown, for example, in Figs. 5-5C in the form of an open bucket, but which can also be provided with a removable lid of some previously disclosed kind, or some similar container 21, which is permanently covered by a fixed upper part 3 and may exhibit a closeable opening 4 with a screw stopper 5, for example as  shown in Figs. 14-14A, and which comprises a carrying handle 6, 61, has the following subsidiary characteristics:<br>
The bucket 2 or the container 21 exhibits triangular cross-sectional form. The angle X between the two shortest sides 7, 8; 71, 81 of the bucket is essentially a right angle. The handle 6, 61 is arranged in such a way that the effective carrying point 9 for the bucket 2 or the container 21 is situated in a vertical plane 10 located at a point ca. 1/3 across the width B of the bucket 2 or the<br><br>
■I<br>
container between the longest side 11; 111 of the bucket 2 or" the container and the right angle X closest to the aforementioned longest side 11, 111 of the bucket 2 or container 21.<br>
The aforementioned positioning of the carrying handle 6 means that the bucket 2, unlike previously disclosed buckets with traditional carrying handles, is much easier to carry because it also provides clearance 14 for the leg 15 of the person 16 who is carrying the bucket 2 situated closest to the bucket.<br>
Dotted lines are used in Fig. 1 to show the carrying of a previously disclosed bucket, although in a lowered position, from which it can  be seen how the leg 15 risks striking the bucket 102 at each step. In the case of the bucket 2 in accordance with the invention, the carrying arm 17 passes vertically downwards from the shoulder 18 to the carrying handle 6, which is not the case for a previously disclosed bucket 102, where the handle 106 is located further out from the body.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2, 5, 6, 9 and 11, the handle 6 in this case is pivotally mounted about pivot bearings 12 situated on the shortest sides 7, 8 of the bucket in the aforementioned vertical plane 10 either on the side of the bucket 2, inside the bucket and below or above the upper peripheral edge 13 of the bucket.<br>
The handle 6 in this case can be supported in such a way that it is capable of being swung down over the upper edge 13 of the bucket on the outside 2A of the bucket.<br>
For example, the shape of the handle 6 is adapted to the peripheral form of the bucket 2 along a section of it and, for example as shown in Figs. 6 and llA, so as to be swung outside the bucket 2 or to be swung in such a way as to come to rest on a lid 19 between the pivot bearings 12.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an example of a handle 6, in which this exhibits double-articulated 12, 20 vertical legs 21.<br><br>
/<br>
A number of examples show handles 62, 63,   which are ' capable of detachable installation on the bucket 2 in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 respectively, and whose legs 23 are so arranged as to be capable of being lowered inside or outside the essentially vertical sides 1,   8 of the bucket, or of being attached around the upper, lipped peripheral edge 13 of the bucket by means of attachment devices 22 which engage with the peripheral edge 13,<br>
Figs, 10, lOA show an example of a handle 64,   which is supported on at least one mounting point 24 on the longest side of the bucket, so that the carrying point 9 for the bucket 2 is situated in the aforementioned vertical plane 10 at the indicated distance 1/3 B from the longest side 11 of the bucket, viewed around the periphery of the bucket.<br>
Two examples of offset handles 41  are shown in conjunction with this.<br>
Figs. 13, 13A show examples of a handle 65, which is in the form of an angled upright, which, when in its inward-pivoted position I, permits carrying of the bucket 2 in accordance with the above with the actual gripping part 25 of the handle 65 situated at the carrying point 9 of the bucket. The handle 65 can be swung out to an extended position II, in which it is out of the way and helps when pouring the contents from the bucket 2.<br>
The buckets 2 shown here have their two short sides 1,   8 arranged with identical lengths L viewed around the periphery of the bucket, i.e. each of the angles C, D between the sides is ca. 45°* The two short sides may vary in their relative length, however.<br>
The sides 7, 8, 11 of the bucket 2 are essentially flat and are preferably inclined slightly outwards from the bottom 26 of the bucket. The aforementioned bucket 2, which may be referred to in general terms as a vessel, is stackable both when empty and with a lid. Fig. 4 shows how the entire surface 27 of a load pallet 28 is filled effectively without<br><br>
spaces thanks to the fact that the sides 7,   8, 11 of the buckets 2 extend along the peripheral edge 29 of the pallet and to another side 7,   8,   11 of an adjacent bucket 2. When stacking vessels on shelves in stores and/or on display shelves for sale, a corresponding amount of space can also be saved if they can be hung along a wall. There is no restriction on the material used in the<br>
buckets/vessels/containers, although a suitable material is a plastic or metallic material, and it is also possible to use a fibrous material such as cardboard- The container 21 shown in Fig. 15 is made from fibrous material, more specifically from corrugated board or some other strong board material such as cardboard- This variant of a container 21 is formed from three parts, more specifically a bottom part 30, a middle paxt   31 and a lid part 32. The aforementioned parts 30-32 are so arranged as to be attached together to form a stable container 21. The bottom part 30 consists of a trough 30A with lateral flaps 33 folded upwards, and the lid part 32 consists of a flat trough 32A with corresponding lateral flaps 34 folded downwards. The lateral flaps 32, 34 are joined together at their corners 35 and 36, for example by gluing* The lid part 32 has a carrying handle 66, preferably executed in a punched-out form and situated so that, when it is folded out as shown in Fig. 15B, it is in a position such that the effective carrying point 9 for the container 21 is situated in a vertical plane 10, which is also located at a point ca. 1/3 of the way across the width B of the container between the longest side 116 of the container 21 and the right angle x between the shorter sides 76,   81 of the container closest to the aforementioned longest side 116, in a similar fashion to that described above. Carrying the container 21 with the handle 66 raised in this way is also comfortable, because the centre of gravity Tp of the container is situated so as to coincide with the<br><br>
aforementioned Vertical plane 10 at the indicated distance from the respective corners of the sides.<br>
The middle part 31 of the pack 21 can be in the form of a folded piece of cardboard glued together along a joining part 37.<br>
The handle 61 can be in the form of one or two punched-out handle components 66, A, B, which are folded up from the lid part 32 to form a common handle 61.<br>
Fig. 16 shows the difference between carrying a conventional bucket and a bucket in accordance with the invention, in which the carrying handle is displaced laterally towards the person who is carrying the bucket. Depending on the design of the bucket with regard to its corners and its rounding, the effective position of the carrying handle is such that it is situated at a distance of ca. 33-40% from one of its sides, i.e, the side facing towards the person who is carrying the bucket.<br>
The triangular design of a bucket with a carrying handle thus provides the following advantages, among others:<br>
D      Better storage and load efficiency compared with a round bucket.<br>
□     Better ergonomics with regard to carrying by the handle,<br>
D     A large, unobstructed external surface of the bucket that is suitable for a label, for example.<br>
D     The modular system permits more efficient loading and storage.<br>
n      Suitable for hanging from a wall 51 or a ladder, as shown in Fig, 19,<br>
D      The internal flat surface llA of the bucket is adapted for a roller.<br>
D      Easy to empty.<br>
D     An unobstructed surface always faces the person who is carrying the bucket.<br><br>
Fig. 18 shows a bucket in which the side 11 of the bucket 2 intended to face towards the person who is carrying the bucket 2 is illustrated together with the internal flat surface llA suitable for a roller to work against. It also shows how the corners 50 of the bucket 2 are executed with large radii, among other things to facilitate pouring the contents from the bucket 2.<br>
As far as the consumption of materials for previously disclosed buckets and the object of invention are concerned, it is true that the triangular form increases the consumption of material by ca.   20% compared with round buckets, although on the other hand material wastage of ca, 20% is obtained when stamping round lids and bottoms- The triangular form of the bucket thus does not represent any real increase in material consumption.<br>
Figs, 17 and 17A show differences between the load capacity of previous round buckets 21  and triangular buckets 2 with a carrying handle in accordance with the invention. A round bucket 21 with a capacity of 20 litres can be loaded with 11 per layer in two layers on a standard load pallet 28, whereas a triangular bucket 2 with a capacity of 20 litres can be loaded with 12 per layer in three layers. This provides respective load capacities of 440 and 720 litres per pallet; i.e. it is now possible to transport 63% more paint or other contents with a triangular bucket 2 compared with a round bucket 21 of the same volume.<br>
Finally, Figs, 20 and 1 illustrate the modular concept of the system in clear text.<br>
The invention, which gives the advantages and technical effects described and illustrated above, is not restricted to the described and illustrated embodiment, however, but may be varied within the scope of the Patent Claims without departing from the idea of invention*<br><br><br><br><br>
