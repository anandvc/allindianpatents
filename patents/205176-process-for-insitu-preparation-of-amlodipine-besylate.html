Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for insitu preparation of Amlodipine besylate and other pharmaceutically acceptable salts without isolating the amlodipine free base. The present invention particularly describes the acid addition salts of amlodipine viz., besylate, maleate and succinate salts.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Amlodipine besylate is a long-acting calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine besylate is chemically described as (R/S) 3-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(2-aminoethoxymethyl)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-K4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate benzenesulphonate and having the structural formula (1) below.<br><br>
wherein, X represents besylate, maleate and succinate anion.<br>
Amlodipine is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure and chest pain (angina). Amlodipine belongs to a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. The Commercial product containing Amlodipine besylate is available under the Brand name NORVASC ( Pfizer Inc).<br>
Amlodipine is a generic name for 3-ethyl 5-methyl (+A)-2-(2-aminoethoxy)methyI]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate, and was disclosed as a novel substance in the European Patent EP-B-00 89 167 as a useful anti ischemic and antihypertensive agent. Also, pharmaceutically acceptable amlodipine acid addition salts were described, among which, maleate salt is particularly suitable.<br><br>
EP0089I67 disclosed 3 synthetic routes for the preparation of amlodipine maleate ie. 2-[(2-aminoethoxy)methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxyarbonyl-6-methyl-l,4-dihydropyridine   maleate.     The  deprotection  of the  phthaloyl   group   is  achieved   by  three conventional methods viz., by using ethanolic methylamine or with hydrazine hydrate or with alkali metal hydroxide followed by acid treatment.<br>
Amlodipine   Base   produced   upon  dephthaloylation   was   isolated,   and   the   pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts were prepared.<br>
These salts are prepared by slurrying the said base in industrial methylated spirit and treating with<br>
acids.<br>
US 4879303 describe the process for the preparation of besylate salt of amlodipine and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. Amlodipine besylate was prepared by two different methods viz., treating the amlodipine base with benzene sulphonic acid and ammonium benzene sulphonate in a solvent like industrial methylated spirit,<br>
WO02053135 describes study of amlodipine free base and its crystalline forms I and II. This patent taught the deprotection step of N- protected amlodipine; obtain the free base in solid state form. The solution from which amlodipine free base precipitates out can be the solution resulting from the deprotection step; or from a different solution like extraction solvent. The purification of amlodipine from a non-aqueous solvent is also disclosed.<br>
WO02053535 describes the preparation of amlodipine maleate by treating the phthalimido amlodipine with aqueous methylamine at 25°C for 24hrs. The free base was extracted with toluene, followed by distillation of the extracted layer under vacuum until the precipitation occurred. This base was further dissolved in Ethanol and the solution was filtered and then treated with the solution of maieic acid in ethanol to precipitate the maleate salt of amlodipine. The Amlodipine free base is not isolated by filtration, but the patent describes the precipitation of Amlodipine base solution in Toluene by vacuum distiHag£i&amp;e*followed by further dissolution of the Base in ethanol. It amounts to isolation of the base prior to treatment with Maieic acid in ethanol<br><br>
EP 0599220 and Vj/003/004025 disclose a process for the preparation of amlodipine benzenesulphonate by the reaction of trityl-protected amlodipine base with benzenesuiphonic acid. The product was obtained in the form of a resin and the processing thereof is extremely complicated including continuous extraction of amlodipine besylate. Additionally the product is the dihydrate of Amlodipine besylate and an additional step is required to convert it to anhydrous form.<br>
WO 03/043635 describes additional forms of Amlodipine besylate and forms like crystalline hydrates and anhydrates and amorphous forms are described. The process involves conversion of Amlodipine Besylate to different forms. This patent reports the reaction of amlodipine base with Benzene Sulfonic acid in water or water alcohol mixtures at 40°C to precipitate the hydrate or anhydrate forms of amlodipine besylate directly from the solution depending upon the conditions employed. Pharmaceutical compositions contain amlodipine besylate hydrate and anhydrate along with the excipients is disclosed.<br>
All processes described in the prior art involve isolation of Amlodipine free base by filtration or concentration / evaporation of solvent used for extraction of Amlodipine free base. Even WO 02/ 053535 describes the precipitation of Amlodipine base by vacuum distillation of organic layer containing the Amlodipine base. Noxious vapours of Mono Methyl amine are produced during the processes of prior art except in the process described in WO 02/053535. All prior art processes involve additional steps like cooling, filtration, vacuum distillation leading to longer process times.<br>
It was therefore felt useful to develop an efficient industrial process for the preparation of amlodipine benzenesulfonate. The present invention is directed to prepare amlodipine and its acid addition salts in industrially viable and economically feasible manner by avoiding the drawbacks of the prior art, as described above.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a simple insitii process for the preparation of amlodipine besylate salt with improved efficiency.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for amlodipine besylate with improved yield and with high purity.<br><br>
Further objective of the invention is to provide a simple insitu process for amlodipine other acid<br>
addition salts such as amlodipine maleate, and succinate.<br>
Further object of the invention is to avoid the use of methylamine directly, which produces<br>
hazardous vapors.<br>
Yet another objective is to prepare stable amlodipine besylate anhydrate.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses process for insitu preparation of amlodipine acid addition salts in anhydrated form without isolating the amlodipine base. The present invention particularly describes the acid addition salts of amlodipine viz., besylate, maleate and succinate salts. The deprotection step of phthalimido amlodipine was carried out by employing 40% aqueous monomethyl amine at a temperature range of 25 to 35°C, followed by stirring with organic solvent for 30 minutes. This organic layer was separated and washed with water followed by brine solution. Solution of benzene sulphonic acid in water / co solvent was added to the above solution and stirred for 3 hr to obtain the precipitated amlodipine besylate anhydrate salt without forming any byproducts thereby enhancing the throughput of the reaction..<br>
The present process does not require the Amlodipine base to be precipitated before converting it to a salt. The process thus avoids the extra step like cooling, filtration, vacuum distillation etc. resulting in better recoveries of Toluene, reduction in process time etc.<br>
The amlodipine besylate salt as prepared by the above method is a highly stable anhydrate which does not absorb moisture even when exposed to high humidity of over 75% for prolonged periods. The present invention further discloses process for preparation of other amlodipine salts like amlodipine maleate and amlodipine succinate.<br>
