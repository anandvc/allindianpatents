				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The treatment of tumor can be approached by several modes of therapy, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or any combination of any of these treatments. Among them, chemotherapy is indispensable.for inoperable or metastatic forms of cancer. Considering the diversity of tumors in terms of cell type, morphology, growth rate, and other cellular characteristics, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a "disease-oriented" approach to anti-tumor activity screening. Boyd, M.R (1989) In Principle of Practice of Oncology Devita, J.T., Hellman, S., and Rosenberg, S.A. (Eds.) Vol. 3, PPO Update, No. 10. This in vitro screening system is based on human tumor cell line panels consisting of approximately 60 cell lines of major human tumors (e.g., leukemia, lung cancer, colon cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, or breast cancer), and serves as a tool for identifying compounds that possess anti-tumor activities.<br>
Of particular interest are the anti-tumor compounds that function via one or more of the following four mechanisms: (1) inhibiting G3/M progression of the cell cycle, which might eventually induce the apoptosis in tumor cells (Yeung et ah (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 263:398-404); (2) disturbing tubulin asserobly/dissembly, which may inhibit the cell mitosis and induce the cell apoptosis (Panda et ah (1997) Proc. Natl Acad, Sci. USA 94:10560-10564); (3) inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis effect (Witto et ah (1998) Cancer Metastasis Rev. 17: 155-161; Prewett et ah (1999) Cancer Res. 59: 5209-5218); or (4) regulating Ras protein-dependent signal transduction pathway (Hemandez-AJcoceba ef ah (2000) CellMol Life Sci. 57: 65-76; Buolamwini (.1999) Cur. Opin. Clie. Biol. 3; 500-509).<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The piperazinedione compounds described above include the compounds themselves, as well as their salts and their prodrugs, if applicable. Such salts, for example, can be formed<br>
between a positively charged substituent (e.g., amino) on a piperazinedione compound and an anion, Suitable anions include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, citrate, methanesulfbnate, trifluoroacetate, and acetate.

Other features or advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments, and also from the appending claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The piperazinedione compounds described above can be prepared by methods well known in the art, as well as by the synthetic routes disclosed herein. For example, one can react a piperazine-2,5-dione compound with a heteroaryl formaldehyde to produce an intermediate heteroaryl-methyJidene-pipera2ine-2,5-dione. The intermediate can then bo reduced to heteroaryl-methyl'piperazine-2,5-dione (a compound of this invention), or reacted with a ketone or another formaldehyde, followed by a base treatment, to produce a mixture of piperazinedione isomers, which are cis- or trans- or E- or Z- double bond isomeric forms, The desired isomeric product can be separated from others by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). If preferred, proper functional groups can be introduced into the heteroaryl ring by further modifications. Alternatively, a desired reduced product can be obtained by reacting the product with a reducing agent<br>
Shown below is a scheme that depicts the synthesis of seventeen piperazinedione compounds.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Details of synthesis of Compounds 1-17 are described in Examples 1-17, respectively. To prepare other piperazincdione compounds, the pyridinyl (shown in the above scheme) can be replaced by an aryl or another heteioaryl (e.g., furyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrimidinyl, or indolyl), and one of the two acetyl groups (Ac) on the piperazincdione ring (also shown in the above scheme) can be replaced by another substituent (e.g., carbonyl, carbamido, carbamyl, or carboxyl).<br>
Note that the piperazinedionc compounds contain at least two double bonds, and may further contain one or more asymmetric centers. Thus, they can occur as racemares and racemic mixtures,single enantiomers, individual diastercomers, diastereomcric mixtures, and cis- or trans- or E- or Z- double bond isomeric forms. All such isomeric forms arc contemplated.<br>
Also within the scope of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition that contains an effective amount of at least one piperazinedione compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, this invention covers a method of administering an effective amount of one or more of the piperazinedione compounds described in the "Summary" section above to a subject in need of tumor treatment The piperazinedione compounds can function via one or more of the above described action mechanisms, or via any other mechanism. "An effective amount" refers to the amount of the compound which is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich ei ah, (1966) Cancer Chemother Rep 50:219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardley, N.Y., 1970, 537. An effective amount of the piperazinedione compounds can range from about 0.1 mg/Kg to about 50 mg/Kg. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art,idepending on the types of tumors treated, route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other anti-tumor agents or radiation therapy.<br>
To practice the method of the present invention, a piperazinedione compound-containing composition can be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intraleslonal and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
A sterile injectable composition, for example, a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension, can be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium<br>
 (e.g., synthetic mono- or diglycerides). Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmHceutjcally-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyaxyethylatod versions. These oil solutions or suspensions can also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents. Other commonly used surfactants such as Tweens or Spans or other similar emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticaljy acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage farms can also be used for the purposes of formulation.<br>
A composition for oral administration can be any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and core starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. "When aqueous suspensions or emulsions arc administered orally, the active ingredient can be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined with emulsifying or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring, or coloring agents can be added. A nasal aerosol or inhalation composition can be prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and can be prepared na solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbona, andVor other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art A piperazinedione compound-containing composition can also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration.<br>
The carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. For example, solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins, which form specific, more soluble complexes with the piperazinedione compounds, or one or more solubilizing agents, can be utilized as pharmaceuticalexcipientsfor delivery of the piperazinedione compounds. Examples of other carriers include colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and D&amp;C Yellow # 10.<br>
The piperazinedione compounds can be preliminarily screened for their efficacy in treating cancer by one or more of the following in vitro assays,<br>
One assay is based on the NCI screening system, which consists of approximately 60 cell lines of major human tumors. See Monks, et al. (1991) JNCl 7. Natl Cancer Insz. 83: 757-766; Alley, et al. (1988) Cancer Res. 48: 589-601; Shoemaker, et al. (1988) Frog. Clin Biol Res. 276:265-286; and Stinson, et al. (1989) Proc Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 30: 613. Briefly, a cell suspension that is diluted according to the particular cell type and the expected target cell density (5,000-40,000 cells per well based on cell growth characteristics) is added (100 µL) into a 96-well microliter plate. A pre-incubation is preformed at 37° C for 24 hr. Dilutions at twice of an intended lest concentration are added at time zero in 100 µL aliquots to each well of the microliter plate. Usually, a test compound is evaluated at five 10-fold dilutions. In a routine testing, the highest concentration of the test compound is 10-4 M. Incubations are performed for 48 hr in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 100% humidity. The cells are assayed by using the sulforhodamine B assay described by Rubinstein, et al'. (1990, JNCl J. Natl Cancer Inst. 82:1113-1118) and Skehan, et al. (1990, JNCl, J. Natl Cancer Inst 82: 1107-1112). A plate reader is used to read the optical densities and a microcomputer processes the optical densities into the special concentration parameters. The NCI has renamed an IC50 value, the concentration that causes 50% growth inhibition, a GI50 value to emphasize the correction for the cell counted at time zero; thus, the GI50 measures the growth inhibitory power of the test compound. See Boyd, et al. (1992) In Cytotoxic Anticancer Drugs: Models and Concepts for Drug Discovery and Development; VlEriote, F.A.; Corbett, T.H.; Baker, L.H. (Eds.); Kluwer Academic: Hingham, MA, pp 11-34<br>
hvanother assay, a piperazinedione compound is tested for its cytotoxicity on PC-3 cells (a prostate cancer cell line). More specifjcally, cells are incubated with a test compound in a serum-free medium for 24 hr. The cytotoxic effect can be determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay method described in Boyd (In Principle of Practice of Oncology Devita, J.T., Hellman, S., and Rosenberg, S.A. —(Eds.)-Vol. -3-,PPOUpdate,-No-l-Q, 1989).-<br>
Another in vitro assay can be used to evaluate the efficiency of a piperazinedione compound in arresting the cell cycle progression. More specifically, a test piperazinedione compound is added to PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner using propidium<br>
iodide-stained flow cytometric assessment The cell population of sub-Go/Gi, Gc/Gj. S, and G2/M phase is then determined. In addition, the effect of a piperazinedione compound on fee Ras activity can be examined to determine its regulation of Ras protein-dependent signal transduction pathway.<br>
The anti-tumor activity of a piperazinedione compound can be further assessed by an in vivo animal model. Using SCID mice as the model, PC-3 cells are subcutaneously injected into the mice to develop a prostate tumor. The anti-tumor activity of* piperazinedione compound is determined after treatment. Additionally, the anti-tumor activity of a piperazinedione compound can also be evaluated using in vivo anti-angiogenesis testing. For example, nude mice can be used to test the effect of a piperazinediooe compound on bFGP-induced angiogenesi9. A matrigel with bFGF or vscular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is subcutaneously injected into a mouse with concurrent intraperitoneal administration of a piperazinedione compound. After several days of incubation, the matrigel is cut down for examination of angiogeneais.<br>
