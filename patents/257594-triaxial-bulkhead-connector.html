				<td>The present invention relates to Triaxial Bulkhead Connector.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Connectors for use with electrically conductive triaxial transmission cables provide electrical connectivity with the center conductor of the cable as well as to coaxially arranged conductors within the cable. The center conductor of a triaxial cable is physically and electrically linked to the center conductor of the connector, and the connector can then be used with a mating bulkhead connector, such as might be found on a camera or other piece of telecommunications or entertainment broadcast equipment. U. S. Patent Nos. 5,967. 852.6, 109,963 and 6.575,786 to ADC Telecommunications. Inc. , concern triaxial cable connectors for use in-line. Mounting panels for connectors of this type are also known, as shown in U. S. Patents Nos. 6.146. 192 and 6,231, 380. Continued development in this area is desired.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A bulkhead connector for connecting to a transmission line comprising a rear portion mounted within an opening in a bulkhead with a first end including first and second threads on a first side of the bulkhead and a second end extending through the opening to a second opposing side of the bulkhead. A front connector body and a front shell assembly are threadably attached to the rear portion with an insulator sleeve positioned between them. The front shell assembly includes a front shell with threads for attaching to the rear portion and a center conductor mounted within an insulator. The insulator is mounted within a central opening of the front shell and electrically isolates the center conductor from the front shell.<br>
The second end of the rear portion including threads may be received within the opening in the bulkhead.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the present invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.<br>
Connectors for connecting two lengths of triaxial cables are known and are described in detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,967,852,6,109,963 and 6,575,786, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Various adapters, yokes, mounting plates and bulkheads for cable connectors are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,575,786, noted above, and in U.S. Patents Nos. 6,146,192 and 6,231,380, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, these prior systems did not permit the direct connection to a piece of equipment, such as a camera, without the equipment including a pigtail of cable to which a mating connector is attached. Such an arrangement may be cumbersome and more<br>
prone to damage than a bulkhead mounted connector, such as connector 10 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Connector 10 is adapted to mount to a bulkhead 12. In the preferred embodiment, connector 10 fits in an opening 13 in bulkhead 12 (shown in FIG 13, below). Bulkhead 12 can be the case of a camera 2, such as shown in FIG. 1 A, or some other piece of broadcast transmission equipment. Connector 10 differs from the triaxial connectors described in the referenced U.S. patents in that it is mounted directly to bulkhead 12 without yokes or adapters. Also, connector 10 is not adapted to terminate a jacketed triaxial cable. As will be shown in more detail below, connector 10 is adapted to mate with a triaxial connector on a first side 60 of bulkhead 12 (outside the camera or other equipment) while connecting with one or more electrical leads 4 or other conductors on a second opposite side 62 of bulkhead 12 (inside camera 2 or other equipment).<br>
In the prior art systems, disclosed in the patents cited above, kits were provided to permit connectors terminating jacketed cables to be changed to mate with the style and gender of other cables or broadcast transmission equipment. This required that the connectors on the cables be of the type described in these patents. However, if the cables were not terminated with such modifiable connectors, gender or style modification to connect to a camera with a bulkhead mounted adapter was not possible without cutting off the existing connector and re-terminating the cable. Connector 10 permits the modification of a bulkhead mounted connector to mate with the style and gender of a non-modifiable cable mounted connector. This will permit greater flexibility in the use of cameras and other equipment with existing cable infrastructure, such as might be found at a sporting venue or other broadcast facility.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, connector 10 is a male or plug<br>
connector for mating with a female or jack cable mounted triaxial connector.<br>
Connector 10 includes a connector body or rear portion 14, which is mounted to<br>
bulkhead 12, a front shell assembly 20 which is threadably mounted to rear portion<br>
14 at second threads 22. A front connector body 16 is threadably mounted to rear<br>
portion 14 at first threads 24 and is positioned about front shell assembly 20.<br>
Mounted between front connector body 16 and front shell assembly 20 to physically<br>
and electrically isolate the two from each other is insulator 18. Front connector<br>
body 16 defines a first end 26 and includes a plurality of releasable locking members<br>
positioned about a circumference. Locking members 28 permit the secure yet releasable connection with a mating connector.<br>
Front connector body 16, insulator 18 and front shell assembly 20 comprise a kit 30 for adapting rear portion 14 to mate with a variety of different style or genders of triaxial connectors. Four embodiments of such kits are shown in the FIGS, corresponding to two distinct styles or formats of connectors and two genders within each style. The present invention is not limited to these four embodiments but may be adapted for use with other styles and gender definitions. Different kits 30 are described in further detail in previously incorporated U.S. Patents Nos. 5,967,852,6,109,963 and 6,575,786.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, connector 10 includes a center contact mounting stud 34 which is electrically connected with a center conductor pin 36 of front shell assembly 20. When first end 26 is mated with a mating triaxial cable connector, center conductor pin 36 is electrically connected with the center conductor of the cable. Mounting stud 34 is adapted for connection with a lead within the piece of broadcast equipment of which bulkhead 12 is a part. Connector 10 also includes first coaxial conductor mounting studs 32 which are electrically connected to a front shell 40. When first end 26 is mated with a mating triaxial cable connector, front shell 40 is electrically connected to the first coaxial conductor of the cable. Mounting studs 32 are adapted for connection with a lead or leads within the piece of broadcast equipment of which bulkhead 12 is a part.<br>
Front shell assembly 20 includes front shell 40, center conductor pin 36 and an insulator 38 positioned between and electrically and physically isolating shell 40 and pin 36. Pin 36 is mounted within a central axial opening in insulator 38 and insulator 38 is held within a central axial opening of front shell 40. Front shell 40 is threadably received by second threads 22 to mount front shell assembly to rear portion 14. Front shell 40 includes a plurality of finger 41 (shown in FIG. 3). Center conductor pin 36 is interchangeable with a center conductor jack while front shell 40 is interchangeable with a front shell defining a solid front end without fingers.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6 to 8, a bulkhead connector 110 is shown.<br>
Connector 110 conforms to the same format as connector 10 but is a female or jack<br>
connector. Rear portion 14 is the same for both connectors, as indeed it is for all<br>
styles and genders of bulkhead triaxial connectors according to the present<br>
invention. A kit 130 includes a front shell assembly 120 with a front shell 140 and a center conductor jack 136. Center conductor jack 136 is held within a central axial opening of insulator 38 and insulator 38 is held within a central axial opening of front shell 140. Front shell 140 defines a solid front end 141.<br>
Kit 130 also includes a front connector body 116 and an insulator 118 positioned between front shell assembly 120 and front connector body 116. Front shell assembly 120 is threadably received by second threads 22 and front connector body 116 is threadably received by first threads 24. Center contact mounting stud 34 is electrically connected to center conductor jack 136 and first coaxial mounting studs 32 are electrically connected to front shell 140. Front connector body 116 defines a first end 126 for receiving a mating triaxial cable connector.<br>
FIGS. 9 to 12 show a second embodiment of a rear portion 114 according to the present invention. Rear portion 114 includes an outer shell 48 and an inner shell 50. Outer shell 48 includes bulkhead mounting threads 42 to facilitate mounting rear portion 114 to an opening 13 (shown in FIG. 13) in bulkhead 12. Opening 13 may be threaded to receive threads 42 or an insert may be provided within opening 13 to receive threads 42. Alternatively, lock nuts may be threaded onto threads 42 to secure rear portion 114 to bulkhead 12. Outer shell 48 also includes first threads 24 for threadably receiving a front connector body, such as front connector body 16 or 116.<br>
Outer shell 48 includes a central opening 49 within which is mounted an insulator 52. Insulator 52 includes a central opening 53 within which is mounted inner shell 50 so that the inner and outer shells are electrically and physically isolated. Inner shell 50 includes second threads 22 for threadably receiving front shell assembly 20. Inner shell 50 also defines a central opening 51 within which is mounted a center conductor insulator 44. Center conductor insulator 44 includes a central opening 45 within which is mounted a center conductor shaft 54. Center conductor shaft 54 includes center conductor mounting stud 34 on a first end and a center conductor contact 56 on a second end. When a front shell assembly 20 or 120 is threaded onto second threads 22, center conductor contact 56 engages center conductor pin 36 or jack 136 to electrically connect with mounting stud 34.<br>
First coaxial conductor mounting studs 32 are mounted to a ring 46 which is positioned about and electrically connected to inner housing 50. Inner housing 50 and outer housing 48 are made of an electrically conductive material.<br>
When a front shell assembly 20 or 120 is threadably received by second threads 22, outer shell 40 or 140 is electrically connected with first coaxial connector mounting studs 32 by inner housing 50.<br>
Outer shell 48 has a rear surface 82 adjacent threads 42 and defining a planar rear face. Insulator 52 includes a rear end 76 which when inserted within opening 49 is essentially flush with rear surface 82 of outer shell 48 and defines a rear face of rear portion 114. Mounting studs 32 and 34 extend beyond rear surface 82 and rear end 76 so that they are accessible for attaching to electrical leads, such as leads 4 shown in FIG. 1A inside camera 2. As mounting studs 32 and 34 may be positioned within a case and thereby sheltered from most environmental hazards or impacts and do not need to be covered by additional shields or housings. Since studs 32 and 34 are adapted for directly connecting to leads, no provision is made within rear portions 14,114 and 214 for crimping to conductors within a jacketed triaxial cable.<br>
Inner housing 50 also include a rear extension 80 which extends beyond rear surface 82 and rear end 76 between mounting studs 32 and 34. Along opposing sides of outer shell 48 are a pair of flats 78. Flats 78 permit better girping of rear portion 114 when mounting rear portion 114 to a bulkhead. If the opening in the bulkhead is threaded to receive threads 42, an installer's fingers or a wrench may be used to grasp flats 78 to aid installation. Flats 78 also improve a user's grip of outer shell 48 when assembling the various components included in rear portion 114.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a third embodiment of a rear portion 214 according to the present invention. Many of the components of rear housing 214 are common with rear housing 114 described above. An inner shell 150 includes first coaxial studs 32 integral with the housing and studs 32 define the rearmost extension of inner shell 150. A center conductor contact 154 is mounted between a pair of insulator halves 144 and is positioned within opening 51 of inner housing 150. In other respects, rear portion 214 and 114 engage kit 30 in the same fashion and are received by bulkhead 12 in the same fashion.<br>
Rear portion 214 also includes a rear face defined by rear surface 82 of outer shell 48 and rear end 76 of insulator 52. Inner shell 150 does not include a rear extension 80 extending beyond this rear face. The rear most portion of inner shell 152 are mounting studs 32 and these along with mounting stud 34 extend beyond the rear face.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 14 to 16, a third embodiment of a triaxial bulkhead connector 210 including rear portion 14 and a kit 230 with a front shell assembly 220, insulator 218 and a front connector body 216. Front connector body 216 defines a first end 226 for receiving a mating triaxial cable connector. Front shell assembly 220 includes center conductor pin 36 within insulator 38 (not shown) within a front shell 140 defining a solid front end 141. Connector 210 conforms to a different format and gender definition from the style and genders of connector 10 and 110.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 17 to 19, a fourth embodiment of a triaxial bulkhead connector 310 including rear portion 14 and a kit 330 with a front shell assembly 320, insulator 318 and a front connector body 316. Front connector body 316 defines a first end 326 for receiving a mating triaxial cable connector. Front shell assembly 320 includes center conductor jack 136 within insulator 38 (not shown) within a front shell 40 defining a plurality of fingers 41. Connector 310 conforms to the same format and gender definition as connector 210.<br>
