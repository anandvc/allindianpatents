				<td>The present invention relates to a jacket attachment for carrying  portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machines The present invention particularly relates to a simple, convenient, well-ventilated and appropriate aide to portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machine The present invention particularly relates to a jacket attachment for carrying front and side loaded portable type skiffing and shoot harvesting machines<br>
Tea is the largest labour employing private sector enterprise where constant supply of workers is required for crop harvesting and other field operations round the year The lion's share of expenditure in tea garden pertains to shoot harvesting Now-a-days, human labourers are either not readily available or very expensive for this operation In addition, the labour wages, which are linked to the cost of living, assessed half yearly as per the labour act and the activities of various labour unions also aggravate the plight of garden owners to pay much higher wages to low productive labourers Moreover, the cost of tea is controlled by the auction market, which has stayed almost constant for the past few years Last year, the rate of Indian tea has fallen drastically after arrival of foreign tea in the Indian market India being one of the signatories of WTO agreement and as such has entered into bilateral trade agreements with many countries and therefore, cannot stop the import of tea Now the only option left is to increase quality tea production for greater profits to be competitive in the world markets<br>
Presently, about ten to fifteen per cent of green shoot is left behind or slashed in the field by the owners of tea garden in peak flush period due to unavailability of skilled labourers Moreover, these enterprises and owners have to spend money for harvesting unproductive or over grown shoots,<br><br>
otherwise they will lose the next plucking round or  flush These over grown shoots also reduce the cup quality The problem of unavailability of skilled labourers may be overcome to a large extent by a slight compromise on quality i e by adoption of a shoot-harvesting machine, which increases the overall quantity of shoots harvested However, because of stiff competition, it's in the overall interest of tea growing nations not to compromise on tea quality together with bringing in mechanization to cut the cost of production<br>
Previously, M/s Kawasaki, Japan had been marketing portable type tea skiffing and shoot harvesting machines Now, M/s New Century, Japan has taken over the world market by virtue of better performing machines There are also some new players from Italy and Taiwan, who are trying to establish their presence in this segment of portable type machines<br>
In India, M/s Power Mobiles, Chennai has launched one man portable and two men portable machine one man held and two men operating machines and M/s Falcon Agricultural Tools Ludhiana has launched two men 1200 mm tea plucking machine Two men held tea skiffing and plucking machines are basically of two types a) 1200 mm and b) 1400 mm wide with their total weight being 16 5 kg and 29 kg respectively For anyone evaluating these machines, it will be noticed that the major and comparatively heavier parts viz engine, rotor, and power transmission units, wider section of conical blower assembly are on the engine side whereas, the narrow part of conical section of blower pipe is on the other side of engine The weight distribution of machine is, therefore is also unequal i e 65-70 per cent on engine side and 30 to 35 per cent on the other side This makes the harvesting or skiffing machine being unequally loaded The operator at the engine side is generally made to suffer because of this and<br><br>
gets fatigued quickly and may enentually try to avoid his deployments on this side of the machine on a regular basis if the workers are not replaced frequently, he may not maintain the height of the plucking table resulting in unequal level of shoot harvesting from tea bushes and unequal level of bush table in case of skiffing Therefore, it is important to provide an aide attachment to these machines thereby, making the mechanization operations comparatively easier and operators friendly<br>
Generally, mounting aides are developed for one man tea shoot harvesting machine, one man pruning machine and sprayers and dusters where machine is loaded on back or shoulders by simple straps The boom or the harvesting assembly is then operated by hand The arm of the worker is put under a strenuous eccentric load and therefore, continuous use of such machines makes the operators tired<br>
The major drawback of use of such an aide is that it cannot carry the machine in the forward direction<br>
Another draw back of this aide is that it is not adoptive to the machines, which are side loaded<br>
Yet another draw back of this aide is that unit is not provided with any carrying mechanism for transportation of machine under non-operative conditions<br>
Therefore, it is observed that there is a definite need to develop and provide a simple, convenient aide to portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machines, for ease of operations<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a jacket attachment for carrying portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machines, which obviates the drawbacks as given herein above<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple, convenient, well-ventilated and appropriate aide to portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machine, for ease of operations<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a jacket attachment for carrying front and side loaded portable type skiffing and shoot harvesting machines<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a cushion pad for preventing pin pointed loading (accumulated strain) by different types of machines<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an easy loading and unloading aide to skiffing and shoot harvesting machines<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable aide that is fitted to workers having different physique<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide adequate ventilation for the perspiring body of the operator<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an aide that is adaptive to front-loaded machines or the like<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an aide that is used during the times when two men skiffing/shoot-harvesting machine is being used, on/off the field<br><br>
Still another object of trhe present invention is to provide an aide that can also be used for machines used for trimming and pruning thorny plants such as roses, citrus<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an aide that is adaptive to the mechanical maintenance of the hedges<br>
This invention provides a jacket attachment for carrying portable skiffing and shoot harvesting machines It is suitable for both, front and side loaded portable type skiffing and shoot harvesting machines It consists of a cushion pad for uniform distribution of load from arm to the body of the operators The attachment enables reduction of intensity of vibration of machine to the body with provision for height adjustment, ventilation, and carrying aide by way of clamps and or hooks Moreover, the jacket attachment is suitable for all physiques It reduces operators fatigue and enhances work efficiency It brings about reductions in worker requirements, and is found suitable for skiffing, pruning and shoot harvesting machine requirement for tea, medicinal and aromatic plants harvesting and trimming of scented rose, citrus and other thorny plants<br>
