TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PHENYLACETAMTDO-THIAZOLE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR THEIR<br>
PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS ANTITUMOR AGENTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to phenylacetamido-thiazole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use as therapeutic agents, particularly in the treatment of cancer and cell proliferation disorders.<br>
Discussion of the Background<br>
Several   cytotoxic   drugs   such   as,   e.g.,   fluorouracil   (5-FU),   doxorubicin   and<br>
camptothecins, damage DNA or affect cellular metabolic pathways and thus cause, in<br>
many cases, an indirect block of the cell cycle. Therefore, by producing an irreversible<br>
damage to both normal and tumor cells, these agents result in a significant toxicity and<br>
side-effects.<br>
In this respect, compounds capable of functioning as highly specific antitumor agents by<br>
selectively leading to tumor cell arrest and apoptosis, with comparable efficacy but<br>
reduced toxicity than the currently available drugs, are desirable.<br>
It is well known that progression through the cell cycle is governed by a series of<br>
checkpoint controls, otherwise referred to as restriction points, which are regulated by a<br>
family of enzymes known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk).   In turn, the cdks<br>
themselves are regulated at many levels such as, for instance, binding to cyclins.<br>
The coordinated activation and inactivation of different cycin cdk complexes is<br>
necessary for normal progression through the cell cycle. Both the critical Gl-S and G2-<br>
M transitions are controlled by the activation of different cyclin/cdk activities.  In Gl,<br>
both CdK4/cyclin D and CdK2/cyclin E are thought to mediate the onset of S-phase.<br>
Progression through S-phase requires the activity of CdK2/cyclin A whereas the<br><br>
activation of cdc2 (cdkl)/cyclin A and cdc2/cyclin B are required for the onset of mitosis. For a general reference to cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases see, for instance, Kevin R. Webster et al, in Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 1998, Vol 7(6), 865-887. Checkpoint controls are defective in tumor cells due, in part, to disregulation of cdk activity. For example, altered expression of cyclin E and cdks has been observed in tumor cells, and deletion of the cdk inhibitor p27 KIP gene in mice has been shown to result in a higher incidence of cancer.<br>
Increasing evidence supports the idea that the cdks are rate-limiting enzymes in cell cycle progression and, as such, represent molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the direct inhibition of cdk/cyclin kinase activity should be helpful in restricting the unregulated proliferation of a tumor cell.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide compounds which are useful in treating cell proliferative disorders associated with an altered cell cycle dependent kinase activity. It is another object to provide compounds which have cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity. The present inventors have now discovered that certain phenylacetamido-thiazoles are endowed with cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity and are thus useful in therapy as antitumor agents and lack, in terms of both toxicity and side effects, the aforementioned drawbacks associated with currently available antitumor drugs.<br>
More specifically, the phenylacetamido-thiazoles of the invention are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers including,\ but not limited to: carcinoma such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, including small cell lung cancer, esophagus, gall-bladder, ovary, pancreas, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, and skin, including squamous cell carcinoma; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage including leukaemia, acute lymphocitic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell-lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin!s lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett's lymphoma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukaemia; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including<br><br>
astrocytoma  neuroblastoma,   glioma  and   schwannomas;   other   tumors,   including<br>
melanoma,   seminoma,   teratocarcinoma,   osteosarcoma,   xeroderma  pigmentosum,<br>
keratocanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
Due to  the key role  of cdks  in the regulation of cellular proliferation, these<br>
phenylacetamido-thiazole derivatives are also useful in the treatment of a variety of cell<br>
proliferative disorders such as, for example, benign prostate hyperplasia, familial<br>
adenomatosis polyposis, neurofibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation<br>
associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis, glomerulonephritis and<br>
post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be useful in treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as<br>
suggested by the fact that cdk5 is involved in the phosphorylation of tau protein (J.<br>
Biochem. 117, 741-749,1995).<br>
The compounds of this invention, as modulators of apoptosis, may also be useful in the<br>
treatment of cancer, viral infections, prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected<br>
individuals, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be useful in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and<br>
metastasis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also act as inhibitor of other protein kinases, e.g.,<br>
protein kinase C in different isoforms, Met, PAK-4, PAK-5, ZC-1, STLK-2, DDR-2,<br>
Aurora 1, Aurora 2, Bub-1, PLK, Chkl, Chk2, HER2, rafl, MEK1, MAPK, EGF-R,<br>
PDGF-R, FGF-R, IGF-R, PI3K, weel kinase, Src, Abl, Akt, MAPK, ILK, MK-2, KK-2,<br>
Cdc7, Nek, and thus be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with other<br>
protein kinases.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment and prevention of<br>
radiotherapy-induced or chemotherapy-induced alopecia.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for treating cell proliferative disorders associated with an altered cell cycle dependent kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a phenylacetamido-thiazole derivative represented by formula (T)<br><br><br>
wherein R2 is hydrogen or a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl group and the hydroxy<br>
group onto ring (llc) is in any one of the free positions;<br>
R3 is  selected  from the  group   consisting  of amino,  aminomethyl  (-CH2-NH2),<br>
hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH), straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl or it is a 5 or 6 membered<br>
heterocycle with 1 or 2 heteroatoms selected among nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur;<br>
provided that when R is hydrogen, then R3 is other than methyl or pyridyl-3-yl;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method described above, the cell proliferative disorder<br>
is selected from the group consisting of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, viral infections,<br>
auto-immune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
Specific types of cancer that may be treated include carcinoma, squamous  cell<br>
carcinoma,   hematopoietic   tumors   of myeloid   or   lymphoid   lineage,   tumors   of<br>
mesenchymal origin, tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, melanoma,<br>
seminoma, teratocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, keratocanthoma,<br>
thyroid follicular cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the method described above, the cell proliferative<br>
disorder is selected from the group consisting of benign prostate hyperplasia, familial<br>
adenomatosis    polyposis,    neuro-fibromatosis,    psoriasis,    vascular    smooth    cell<br><br>

glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
in  addition,  the  inventive method  provides  tumor angiogenesis  and  metastasis<br>
inhibition. The inventive method may also provide cell cycle inhibition or cdk/cyclin<br>
dependent inhibition.<br>
In addition to the above, the method object of the present invention provides treatment<br>
and prevention of radiotherapy-induced or chemotherapy-induced alopecia.<br>
The present invention also provides a phenylacetamido-thiazole derivative represented by formula (I)<br>
wherein R2 is hydrogen or a straight or branched Cj-Ce alkyl group and the hydroxy<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Several aminothiazoles are known in the art, for instance as herbicides, synthetic intermediates or even as therapeutic agents. Among these are, as an example, 2-benzamido-l,3-thiazoles as antiallergic agehts (EP-A-261503, Valeas S.pA.); 5-alkyl-2-phenylalkylcarbonylamino-l,3-thiazoles as protein kinase C inhibitors (WO 98/04536, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.); 5-arylthio-2-acylamino-l,3-thiazoles as antitumor agents (EP-A-412404, Fujisawa Pharm. Co.); 4-amino-2-carbonylamino-l,3-thiazoles as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (WO 99/21845, Agouron Pharmaceutical Inc.); aminothiazoles among which are 5-alkenyl-2~acylamino-thiazoles as cyclin dependent kinases inhibitors (WO 99/65884, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.); phenylacetamido-thiazoles substituted by cycloalkyl-alkyl groups as glucokinase activators, useful in the treatment of type H diabetes (WO 01/85707, Hoffinann-La Roche AG). In addition, two international patent applications WO 00/26202 and WO 01/14353 (US 6,114,365), both in the name of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn S.pA. and herewith incorporated by reference, disclose broad classes of amido-thiazole derivatives possessing cell dependent kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
The compounds object of the present invention fall within the scope of the general formula of WO 00/26202 and WO 01/14353 but are not specifically exemplified therein.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may have asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exist either as racemic admixtures or as individual optical isomers which are all within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
As an example, when R is other than hydrogen, the carbon atom to which R itself is attached is an asymmetric carbon atom and, hence, both the (R) and (S) optical isomers of the compounds of formula (I), as well as the racemic (R,S) admixture or any other admixture comprising a majority of one of the two optical (R) or (S) isomers, are within<br>
5     the scope of the invention.<br>
Likewise, the use as an antitumor agent of all the possible isomers and their admixtures and of both the metabolites and the pharmaceutically acceptable bio-precursors (otherwise referred to as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
)<br>
In the present description, as it is clear to the skilled man, the nitrogen atom being part of the Ri moieties of formula (Ila), (lib), (He), (lid) and (lie) is directly bonded, in formula (I), to the phenylene moiety.<br>

Pharmacology<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are active as cdk/cyclin inhibitors and they may be used in the treatment of various tumors such as, for instance, carcinomas, e.g. mammary carcinoma, lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, colon carcinoma, ovary and endometrial tumors, sarcomas, e.g. soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and the hematological malignancies such as, e.g., leukemias.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula (I) arevalso useful in the treatment of other cell proliferative disorders such as psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The inhibiting activity of putative cdk/cyclin inhibitors was determined first with a method based on the use of the MultiScreen-PH 96 well plate (Millipore), in which phosphocellulose filter paper was placed at each well bottom allowing binding of positive charged substrate after a washing/filtration step. When a radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety was transferred by the ser/threo kinase to the filter-bound histone,<br><br>
light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter, according to the following protocol:<br>
Kinase reaction: 1.5 microM histone HI substrate, 25 microM ATP (0.5 microCi P33gammaATP),100 ng Cyclin A/cdk2 complex, 10 microM inhibitor in a final volume of 100 microl buffer (TRIS HC1 10 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 mM, 7.5 raM DTT) were added to each well of a 96 U bottom well plate. After 10 minutes at 37°C incubation, reaction was stopped by 20 microl EDTA 120 mM.<br>
Capture: 100 microl were transferred from each well MultiScreen plate, to allow substrate binding phosphocellulose filter. Plates were then washed 3 times with 150 microl/well PBS Ca-H-/Mg-H~ free and filtered by MultiScreen filtration system. Detection: filters were allowed to dry at 37°C, then 100 microl/well scintillant were added and 33P labelled histone HI was detected by radioactivity counting in the Top-Count instrument.<br>
Results: data were analysed and expressed as % inhibition referred to total activity of enzyme (=100%).<br>
When the number of compounds to be tested became consistent, the need for a fast and homogeneous screening assay was raised. Thus a method of assay based on the use of the SPA technology (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was set up. The assay consists of the transfer of radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety by the kinase to a biotinylated substrate. The resulting 33P-labelled biotinylated product is allowed to bind to streptavidin-coated SPA beads (biotin capacity 130pmol/mg), and light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>

0.0015 to 10 microM. Experimental data were analyzed by the computer program<br>
GraphPad Prizm using the four parameter logistic equation:<br>
y = bottom+(top-bottom)/(l+10A((logIC50-x)*slope))<br>
where x is the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, y is the response; y starts at<br>
bottom and goes to top with a sigmoid shape.<br>

Experimental method: Reaction was carried out in buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2s 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 7.5 mM DTT) containing 3.7 nM enzyme, histone and ATP (constant ratio of cold/labeled ATP 1/3000). Reaction was stopped with EDTA and the substrate captured on phosphomembrane (Multiscreen 96 well plates from Millipore). After extensive washing, the multiscreen plates are read on a top counter. Control (time zero) for each ATP and histone concentrations was measured.<br>
Experimental design: Reaction velocities are measured at different four ATP, substrate (histone) and inhibitor concentrations. An 80-point concentration matrix was designed around the respective ATP and substrate Km values, and the inhibitor IC50 values (0.3, 1, 3, 9 fold the Km or IC50 values). A preliminary time course experiment in the absence of inhibitor and at the different ATP and substrate concentrations allow the selection of a single endpoint time (10 min) in the linear range of the reaction for the Ki determination experiment.<br>
Kinetic parameter estimates: Kinetic parameters were estimated by simultaneous nonlinear least-square regression using [Eq.l] (competitive inhibitor respect to ATP, random mechanism) using the complete data set (80 points):<br><br>
v =	—	—      [Eq.l]<br>

Given the above inhibition assays, the compounds of formula (I) of the invention<br>
resulted to possess a remarkable cdk inhibitory activity.<br>
As an example, when tested against cdk2/cyclin A, the representative compound of the<br>
invention (2S)-2-[4-(acetylamino)phenyl]-N-(5-isopropyl-l,3-thiazol-2-yl)propanamide<br>
showed an inhibitory activity, expressed as ICso, of 11 nM.<br>
Surprisingly, the said inhibitory activity resulted to be markedly superior than that of a .<br>
very close prior art compound, used for comparative purposes. In fact, when tested<br>
against cdk2/cyclin A as formerly reported, the compound N-(5-isopropyl-l,3-thiazol-2-<br>
yl)-2-[4-(acetylamino)phenyl]acetamide of WO 01/14353 (see example 4, bridging<br>
paragraph on pages 32,33 of the same), showed an IC50 value of 110 nM.<br>
Another representative compound of the invention, namely N-(5-isopropyl-l,3-thiazol-<br>
2-yl)-2-[4-(2-oxo-l-pirrohdinyl)phenyl]acetamide    showed,    when    tested    against<br>
cdc2/cyclin A, similar markedly superior activity.<br>
So far, the novel compounds of the invention are unexpectedly endowed with a cdk<br>
inhibitory activity significantly higher than that of the closest prior art compounds of<br>
WO 01/14353 and are thus particularly advantageous, in therapy, against proliferative<br>
disorders associated with an altered cell cycle dependent kinase activity.<br>
By restricting the unregulated proliferation of tumor cells, the compounds of formula (T)<br>
are therefore useful in therapy in the treatment of various tumors such as, for instance,<br>
carcinomas, e.g., mammary carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, colon carcinoma, ovary<br>
endometrial   tumors,   sarcomas,   e.g.,   soft  tissue   and  bone   sarcomas,   and   the<br>
hematological malignancies such as, e.g., leukemias.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula (I) are also useful in the treatment of other cell<br><br>
proliferative disorders such as psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>

As an example, the compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents such as, for instance, exemestane, formestane, anastrozole, letrozole, fadrozole, taxane and derivatives such as paclitaxel or docetaxel, encapsulated taxanes, CPT-11, camptothecin derivatives, anthracycline glycosides, e.g., doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, etoposide, navelbine, vinblastine, carboplatin, cisplatin, estramustine phosphate, celecoxib, tamoxifen, raloxifen, Sugen SU-5416, Sugen SU-6668, Herceptin, and the like, optionally within liposomal formulations thereof.<br>
If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described below and the other pharmaceutically active agent within the approved dosage range.<br>
Compounds of formula (T) may be used sequentially with known anticancer agents when a combination formulation is inappropriate.<br>
