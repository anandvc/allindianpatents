				<td>Extraction Process for Removal of Impurities from an Oxidizer Purge<br>
Stream in the Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the recovery of a metal catalyst from an<br>
oxidizer purge stream produced in the synthesis of carboxylic acid, typically<br>
terephthalic acid. More particularly, the process involves the addition of a<br>
wash solution to a high temperature molten dispersion to recover the metal<br>
catalyst and then subjecting an aqueous mixture or purified aqueous<br>
mixture so formed to a single stage extraction to remove organic impurities<br>
to produce an extract stream and a raffinate stream comprising the metal<br>
catalyst. This invention also relates to a process to produce a high boiling<br>
point organic impurities stream from an aqueous mixture or a purified<br>
aqueous mixture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terephthalic acid is commercially produced by oxidation of<br>
paraxylene in the presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, Co, Mn, Br<br>
and a solvent. Terephthalic acid used in the production of polyester fibers,<br>
films, and resins must be further treated to remove impurities formed as a<br>
result of the oxidation of paraxylene.<br>
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is an intermediate in the production of<br>
polyesters for plastics and fiber applications. Commercial processes for the<br>
manufacture of TPA are often based on the heavy-metal catalyzed<br>
oxidation of p-xylene, generally with a bromide promoter in an acetic acid<br>
solvent. Due to the limited solubility of TPA in acetic acid under practical<br>
oxidation conditions, a slurry of TPA crystals is usually formed in the<br>
oxidation reactor. Typically, the TPA oxidizer slurry is withdrawn from the<br>
reactor and TPA solids are separated from the oxidizer mother liquor using<br>
conventional solid-liquid separation techniques. The oxidizer mother liquor,<br>
which contains most of the catalyst and promoter used in the process, is<br>
recycled to the oxidation reactor. Aside from the catalyst and promoter, the<br>
oxidizer mother liquor also contains dissolved TPA and many by-products<br>
and impurities. These by-products and impurities arise partially from minor<br>
impurities present in the p-xylene feed stream. Other impurities arise due to<br>
the incomplete oxidation of p-xylene resulting in partially oxidized products.<br>
Still other by-products result from competing side reactions formed as a<br>
result of the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid. Patents disclosing<br>
the production of terephthalic acid such as U.S patent #4,158,738 and<br>
#3,996,271 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the<br>
extent that they do not contradict statements herein.<br>
The TPA solids undergo a solid-liquid separation wherein fresh<br>
solvent is utilitized to displace a major portion of the liquid component of the<br>
oxidizer mother liquor. After drying, the TPA solids are contaminated with<br>
impurities that were present in the oxidizer mother liquor since these<br>
impurities may be incorporated into the TPA solids. Impurities are also<br>
present due to occlusions in the TPA crystal structure and due to<br>
incomplete removal of the oxidizer mother liquor by the fresh solvent wash.<br>
Many of the impurities in the oxidizer mother liquor stream that are<br>
recycled are relatively inert to further oxidation. Such impurities include, for<br>
example, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid and trimellitic acid. Impurities, which<br>
may undergo further oxidation are also present, such as, for example, 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde, p-toluic acid and p-tolualdehyde. Oxidation inert<br>
impurities tend to accumulate in the oxidizer mother liquor upon recycle.<br>
The concentration of these inert impurities will increase in the oxidizer<br>
mother liquor until an equilibrium is reached whereby the rate of removal of<br>
each impurity via the TPA product balances with the rate of formation and<br>
the rate of addition to the oxidation process. The normal level of impurities<br>
in commercial crude TPA makes it unsuitable for direct use in most polymer<br>
applications.<br>
Conventionally, crude TPA has been purified either by conversion to<br>
a dimethyl ester or by dissolution in water with subsequent hydrogenation<br>
over standard hydrogenation catalysts. More recently, secondary oxidative<br>
treatments have been used to produce polymer-grade TPA. It is desirable<br>
to minimize the concentration of impurities in the mother liquor and thereby<br>
facilitate subsequent purification of TPA. In some cases, it is not possible to<br>
produce a purified, polymer-grade TPA unless some means for removing<br>
impurities from the oxidizer mother liquor stream is utilized.<br>
One technique for impurity removal from a recycle stream commonly<br>
used in the chemical processing industry is to draw out or "purge" some<br>
portion of the oxidizer mother liquor that is recycled. Typically, the purge<br>
stream is simply disposed of or, if economically justified, subjected to<br>
various treatments to remove undesired impurities while recovering<br>
valuable components. One example is U.S. #4,939,297 herein<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent it does not contradict<br>
statements herein. The amount of purge required for control of impurities is<br>
process-dependent; however, a purge amount equal to 10-40%, hereafter<br>
known as oxidizer purge stream, of the total oxidizer mother liquor stream is<br>
usually sufficient to produce TPA adequate as feedstock for commercial<br>
polymer manufacture. In the production of TPA, the percentage purge of the<br>
oxidizer mother liquor stream necessary to maintain acceptable impurity<br>
concentrations, coupled with the economic value of the metal catalyst and<br>
solvent components in the oxidizer purge stream, make simple disposal of<br>
the oxidizer purge stream economically unattractive. Thus, there is a need<br>
for a process that recovers essentially all of the valuable metal catalysts<br>
and acetic acid contained in the oxidizer purge stream while removing a<br>
major portion of the impurities present in the oxidizer purge stream. The<br>
metal catalyst can be recovered in an active form suitable for reuse by<br>
direct recycling to the p-xylene oxidation step.<br>
This invention is a marked improvement over a typical purge<br>
process. Some of the advantages are:<br>
1) enhanced operability and reliability due to reduction in plugging<br>
potential;<br>
2) reduction in overall energy usage;<br>
3) reduction in the amount of water to the solvent extraction step.<br>
The invention enhances the impurity removal efficacy of the process,<br>
and the operability of the process compared to the existing processes. In<br>
addition it should be noted that this invention does not just apply to the<br>
crude TPA process but any process that produces an oxidizer purge stream<br>
where recovery of metal catalyst is needed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, a process to recover a metal<br>
catalyst and remove impurities from an oxidizer purge stream 301 is<br>
provided as shown in Figure 1. The process comprises the following steps.<br>
Step (a) comprises subjecting an oxidizer purge stream 301<br>
comprising a carboxylic acid, a metal catalyst, impurities, water and a<br>
solvent to evaporation in a first evaporator zone 321 to produce a vapor<br>
stream 304 and a concentrated purge slurry 305.<br>
The oxidizer purge stream 301 is withdrawn from a carboxylic acid<br>
oxidative synthesis process. The oxidizer purge stream 301 serves as the<br>
feed stream to the present process. The oxidizer purge stream 301<br>
comprises carboxylic acid, water, a solvent, the metal catalyst and<br>
impurities. The impurities comprise organic bromides and corrosion metals.<br>
The organic bromides are used as promoters in the oxidation reaction.<br>
Examples of corrosion metals are iron and chromium compounds, which<br>
inhibit, reduce or entirely destroy the activity of the metal catalyst.<br>
Carboxylic acids include aromatic carboxylic acids produced via<br>
controlled oxidation of an organic substrate. Such aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
include compounds with at least one carboxylic acid group attached to a<br>
carbon atom that is part of an aromatic ring, preferably having at least 6<br>
carbon atoms, even more preferably having only carbon atoms. Suitable<br>
xamples of such aromatic rings include, but are not limited to, benzene,<br>
biphenyl, terphenyl, naphthalene, and other carbon-based fused aromatic<br>
rings. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
terephthalic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluic, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid,<br>
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, and 2,5-diphenyl-terephthalic acid.<br>
Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, aliphatic monocarboxylic<br>
acids, preferably containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or benzoic acid<br>
and mixtures thereof and mixtures of these compounds with water.<br>
Preferably the solvent is acetic acid mixed with water, in a ratio of about 5:1<br>
to about 25:1, preferably between about 8:1 and about 20:1. Throughout<br>
the specification acetic acid will be referred to as the solvent. However, it<br>
should be appreciated that other suitable solvents, such as those disclosed<br>
previously, may also be utilized.<br>
In step (a) of the present process, the oxidizer purge stream 301 is<br>
concentrated by conventional means in a first evaporator zone 321<br>
comprising an evaporator to produce a vapor stream 304 and a<br>
concentrated purge slurry 305. In an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
evaporator is operated at atmospheric or slightly superatmospheric<br>
conditions, generally from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres.<br>
The vapor stream 304 comprises a majority of the water and solvent, and<br>
the concentrated purge slurry 305 comprises the remainder of the water<br>
and solvent not removed from the oxidizer purge stream 301. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the evaporation removes about 50 wt% to<br>
about 80 wt% of the solvent and water, typically acetic acid and water,<br>
which are present in the oxidizer purge stream 301.<br>
Step (b) comprises subjecting the concentrated purge slurry 305 to<br>
evaporation in a second evaporator zone 350 to produce a solvent rich<br>
stream 344 and a high temperature molten dispersion 345; wherein about<br>
95 wt% to about 99 wt% of the solvent and water is removed from the<br>
oxidizer purge stream 301 in step (a) and step (b) combined; and wherein<br>
the second evaporator zone 350 comprises an evaporator operated at a<br>
temperature of about 150°C to about 200°C.<br>
The concentrated purge slurry 305 is introduced in the second<br>
evaporator zone 350, which comprises at least one evaporator. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the evaporator is operated at super<br>
atmospheric or pressurized conditions, generally from about 1 atmosphere<br>
to about 10 atmospheres. The evaporation is conducted at a temperature<br>
from about 150°C to about 220°C; another range is from about 180°C to<br>
about 200°C. In an embodiment of the invention the combination of<br>
evaporators 321 and 350 are operated so as to concentrate the oxidizer<br>
purge stream 301 as represented by stream 301 to a condition wherein 95-<br>
99 wt% of the solvent, typically acetic acid and water, is removed from the<br>
oxidizer purge stream 301.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the condition of the high<br>
temperature molten dispersion 345 has only enough remaining solvent to<br>
provide pumpability. In one embodiment, a typical composition of the the<br>
12<br>
high temperature molten dispersion 345 is shown in Table 1. Generally, the<br>
mass composition of the sum total of all compounds shown in Table 1,<br>
excluding water and acetic acid, in the high temperature molten dispersion<br>
345 can vary between about 5 wt% to about 80 wt% based on the total<br>
weight of the high temperature molten dispersion 345. Another range for the<br>
sum total of all compounds shown in Table 1, excluding acetic acid and<br>
water, in the high temperature molten dispersion 345 can be all<br>
combinations of upper and lower ranges where the lower ranges are 5 wt%,<br>
10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt% and the upper<br>
ranges are 80 wt%, 75 wt%, 70 wt%, 65 wt%, 60 wt%, 55 wt%, 50 wt%, 45<br>
wt% based on the total weight of the high temperature molten dispersion<br>
345. Further, ranges stated in this disclosure and the claims that follow<br>
should be understood to disclose the entire range specifically and not just<br>
the end point(s). For example, disclosure of the range 0 to 10 should be<br>
taken to specifically disclose 2, 2.5, 3.17 and all other number subsumed<br>
and not just 0 and 10.<br>
Step (c) comprises mixing in a mixing zone 348 a wash solution<br>
306 with the high temperature molten dispersion 345 to form an aqueous<br>
mixture 307.<br>
The high temperature molten dispersion 345 is then subjected to<br>
extraction of the metal catalyst in the mixing zone 348 by introduction of a<br>
wash solution 306 which can contain water or a water-acetic acid or a wash<br>
solution to form an aqueous mixture in stream 307 wherein at least 80% of<br>
he metal catalyst is recovered in the aqueous phase of the aqueous<br>
mixture 307. Typically, at least 90% of the metal catalyst is recovered in<br>
the aqueous phase of the aqueous mixture 307. The wash solution<br>
comprises water and optionally an additional solvent. The solvent can be<br>
any substance capable of dissolving the metal catalyst to form a uniformly<br>
dispersed solution at the molecular or ionic size level. Typically, the solvent<br>
comprises acetic acid, but solvents that have been previously mentioned in<br>
step (a) can also be utilized.<br>
The mixing zone 348 comprises a vessel and/or a device or a<br>
plurality of vessels or devices wherein there is sufficient residence time for<br>
the metal catalyst and/or halogen compounds, such as for example<br>
bromine, to dissolve into solution. Examples of such vessels are devices<br>
include, but are not limited to, a tank and a stirred or agitated tank. In this<br>
step, it is not necessary to completely dissolve the mixture. One method is<br>
to utilize only the necessary amount of water to obtain the level of the metal<br>
catalyst recovery desired. However, the addition of wash solution 306 also<br>
serves to quench the mixture to a temperatures in the range of about 60°C<br>
to about 95°C, another range is about 80°C to about 90°C. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention the quenching is done for about 0.5 to about 4<br>
hours, another range is about 1 to about 2 hours. By this treatment organic<br>
bromides are reacted to yield inorganic bromides that are for example,<br>
preferentially retained in the aqueous fraction exiting an extractor. The<br>
quantity of bromine-containing compounds purged from the system along<br>
with the unwanted impurities is thereby minimized. The heat treatment<br>
conserves bromides and simplifies disposal of the organic impurities.<br>
The addition of wash solution 306 in the mixing zone 348 not only<br>
recovers the metal catalyst in the high temperature molten dispersion 345,<br>
but also aids in pumping the aqueous mixture 307. It is desirable to keep<br>
the aqueous mixture 307 circulating with an external circulation loop.<br>
In one embodiment, a typical composition of the aqueous mixture is<br>
shown in Table 1. Generally, the mass composition of the aqueous mixture<br>
307 in this embodiment generally can vary wherein the mass ratio of water<br>
to acetic acid is in the range of about 1:1 to 99:1 and wherein the sum<br>
aggregate of isophthalic acid, benzoic acid, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, and<br>
terephthalic acid comprises between about 1000 ppm to about 65 wt% of<br>
the total weight of the aqueous mixture 307. Another range can be all<br>
combinations of upper and lower ranges wherein the sum aggregate of<br>
isophthalic acid, benzoic acid, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, and terephthalic<br>
have a lower range of 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35<br>
wt%, 40 wt% and a upper range of 65 wt%, 60 wt%, 55 wt%, 50 wt%, 45<br>
wt% based on the total weight of the aqueous mixture 307.<br>
When separating in the solid-liquid separation zone 351 is<br>
performed, a small amount of extraction solvent in conduit 311, generally<br>
about 1 to about 10% by weight, preferably about 5% by weight, may be<br>
added to the mixing zone 348 to enhance slurry handling by reducing<br>
adherence of solids to the side of, for example, a slurry feed tank. This is<br>
represented by the dashed arrow from stream 311 in Figure 1.<br>
Step (d) comprises optionally separating organic impurities 312 from<br>
the aqueous mixture 307 in a solid-liquid separation zone 351 to form a<br>
purified aqueous mixture 308.<br>
The aqueous mixture stream 307 can be optionally fed to a solidliquid<br>
separation zone 351 comprising a solid-liquid apparatus, wherein<br>
organic impurities 312 may be removed from the aqueous mixture 307 to<br>
form a purified aqueous mixture 308 and organic impurities 312. There are<br>
no limitations on the type of solid-liquid separation apparatus as long as it is<br>
sufficient to remove organic impurities 312 from the aqueous mixture 307.<br>
Examples of such apparatuses include, but are not limited to, filters,<br>
centrifuges, cyclones, hydroclones, etc.<br>
The organic impurities can comprise numerous compounds typically<br>
associated with TPA production. Examples of typical organic impurities<br>
include, but are not limited to, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, benzoic acid,<br>
phthalic acid, fluorenones compounds, p-toluic acid, and 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde.<br>
In one embodiment, a typical composition of the purified aqueous<br>
mixture 308 is shown in Table 1. The mass composition of the purified<br>
aqueous mixture 308 in this embodiment comprises acetic acid, water,<br>
isophthalic acid, benzoic acid, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, terephthalic acid,<br>
and cobalt; wherein the sum aggregate of the isophthalic acid, benzoic acid,<br>
-carboxybenzaldehyde, and terephthalic acid comprise between about 1<br>
wt% to 70% based on the total weight of the purified aqueous mixture 308;<br>
wherein the sum aggregate of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid<br>
comprise no more than 10 wt% of the purified aqueous mixture 308.<br>
Another range can be all combinations of upper and lower ranges wherein<br>
the sum aggregate of isophthalic acid, benzoic acid, 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde, and terephthalic have a lower range of 5 wt%, 10<br>
wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt% based on the total<br>
weight of the purified aqueous mixture 308 and a upper range of 65 wt%,<br>
60 wt%, 55 wt%, 50 wt%, 45 wt% based on the total weight of the purified<br>
aqueous mixture 308; and wherein the sum aggregate of isophthalic acid<br>
and terephthalic acid comprise no more than 10 wt% based on the total<br>
weight of the purified aqueous mixture 308.<br>
As previously stated when the solid-liquid separation zone 351 is<br>
utilized, a small amount of extraction solvent in conduit 311, generally about<br>
1 to about 10% by weight, preferably about 5% by weight may be added to<br>
the mixing zone 348 to enhance slurry handling by reducing adherence of<br>
solids to the side of, for example, a slurry feed tank. This is represented by<br>
the dashed arrow from stream 311 in Figure 1.<br>
Step (e) comprises adding an extraction solvent 311 to the aqueous<br>
mixture 307 or the purified aqueous mixture 308 in an extraction zone 323<br>
to form an extract stream 309 and the raffinate stream 310.<br>
The aqueous mixture 307 or the purified aqueous mixture 308 is fed<br>
to an extraction zone 323 wherein the aqueous mixture 307 or the purified<br>
aqueous mixture 308 and the extraction solvent 311 are contacted in the<br>
extraction zone 323. The aqueous mixture 307 or the purified aqueous<br>
mixture 308 and the extraction solvent 311 are mixed to form an extract<br>
stream 309 comprising solvent, water organic impurities, and organic<br>
solvent which forms a lighter phase, and the raffinate stream 310<br>
comprising a metal catalyst, corrosion metals, and water. The extract<br>
stream 309 is withdrawn as an overhead stream, and the raffinate stream<br>
310 is withdrawn from the bottom of extractor in the extraction zone 323. In<br>
this invention, one embodiment of the extraction zone 323 is a single stage<br>
extractor.<br>
The extraction solvent 311 used in the extractor should be<br>
substantially water-insoluble to minimize the amount of organic solvent<br>
dissolved in the aqueous fraction. Additionally, the extraction solvent 311 is<br>
preferably an azeotropic agent which serves to assist solvent recovery from<br>
the organic extract. Solvents, which have proven to be particularly useful<br>
are C1 to C6 alkyl acetates, particularly n-propyl acetate (n-PA), isopropyl<br>
acetate, isobutyl acetate, sec-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate and n-butyl<br>
acetate, although other water-insoluble organic solvents having an<br>
appropriate density and a sufficiently low boiling point may also be used,<br>
such as p-xylene. N-propyl acetate and isopropyl acetate are particularly<br>
preferred due to their relatively low water solubility, excellent azeotropic<br>
behavior, and their ability to remove the remaining acetic acid as well as<br>
high-boiling organic impurities from the aqueous mixture.<br>
The extraction can be effected using extraction solvent ratios from<br>
about 1 to about 4 parts by weight extraction solvent per part of extractor<br>
feed depending on the extractor feed composition. Space velocities of the<br>
combined feeds to the extractor generally range from about 1 to about<br>
3 hr"1. Although the extraction can be conducted at ambient temperature<br>
and pressure, heating the extraction solvent 311 and extractor to about<br>
30°to about 70° C. Another range of about 40°C to about 60° C can be<br>
used. Although the extract stream 309 comprises small amounts of the<br>
metal catalyst and corrosion metals, essentially all of the metal catalyst and<br>
the majority of the remaining corrosion metals are contained in the heavier<br>
phase, the raffinate stream 310.<br>
Step (f) comprises separating the extract stream 309 and the solvent<br>
rich stream 344 in a separation zone 324 to form a high boiling point<br>
organic impurities stream 315.<br>
The extract stream 309 comprises organic solvent and organic<br>
impurities. The extract stream 309 can further comprises acetic acid and<br>
water, often in minor amounts. The extract stream 309 may be distilled in a<br>
separation zone comprising conventional distillation equipment. The<br>
distillation equipment is operated at process conditions sufficient to recover<br>
a majority of the extraction solvent, typically n-propyl acetate, from the<br>
extract stream 309. Convention distillation equipment includes, for example,<br>
a distillation column. One key feature to this invention is the use of the<br>
solvent rich stream 344 into the separation zone 324.<br>
Most of the organic impurities are extracted by the organic solvent in<br>
the extraction zone 323. This occurs because the organic impurities show<br>
a high degree of solubility for the organic solvent and to a lesser extent for<br>
acetic acid. By distilling the lighter phase from the extractor, the organic<br>
solvent is evaporated allowing the organic impurities to concentrate in the<br>
column underflow. This results in a high probability for plugging and<br>
precipitation of solids. By utilizing the solvent rich stream 344, the organic<br>
impurities in the column underflow can be effectively diluted and thereby<br>
solubilized by acetic acid in the column underflow.<br>
The use of the solvent rich stream 344, from the previous<br>
evaporation serves two functions. First, the loss of the organic solvent is<br>
minimized since the solvent rich stream 344 effectively displaces the<br>
organic solvent in the column underflow. Second, the use of acetic-acid<br>
rich vapor provides significant enthalpy needed for driving the<br>
distillation/separation process.<br>
The separation zone 324 will need to process significantly less<br>
hydraulic load than a typical purge process due to the greater concentration<br>
of mother liquor. Recovered extraction solvent and acetic acid may be<br>
recycled to the extractor and oxidative reactor, respectively. The highboiling<br>
point organic impurities are removed as sludge from the base of the<br>
distillation column for disposal.<br>
Although the composition of the various streams in the process<br>
varies depending on the process conditions, a typical composition of the<br>
streams are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, the components are shown in<br>
the left hand column and the amount of these components in each stream<br>
in the Figure 1 are shown in the number column corresponding to the<br>
number of the stream in Figure 1. The amounts of the components shown<br>
in Table 1 can be any measurement of weight as long as it is consistent for<br>
all components and all streams. For example, the oxidizer purge stream<br>
301 has acetic acid in the amount of 915 pounds, 915 grams, etc.(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
