				<td>A VALVE ASSEMBLY FOR USE WITH A SYRINGE AND WHICH<br>
PREVENTS BACKFLOW.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a valve assembly for use with a<br>
syringe and which prevents backflow and is further directed to valve that can<br>
be attached to a catheter, a needle or any other type of injecting device and<br>
that has a particular configuration to prevent backflow. The invention is<br>
particularly directed to a needle free access valve for use in a needle free<br>
intravenous access system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A needle free access valve is one where the valve can be<br>
opened using a needleless syringe. A needleless syringe is a syringe where<br>
the needle has been removed such that the front of the syringe has only the<br>
luer taper or luer lock. Such valves are known but suffer from a number of<br>
disadvantages.<br>
A typical known valve has a body composed of two cylindrical<br>
containers. One container has a tubular opening into which the luer taper can<br>
be pressed. The other container has a tubular opening filled with a luer lock<br>
that allows the valve to be attached to various medical devices. Fluid flows<br>
through the luer taper upon depression of the syringe plunger and flows<br>
through the valve. The valve has a circular valve disk that can be forced<br>
open by the pressure of the fluid. When the fluid pressure stops, the valve<br>
returns to its closed position. This type of arrangement is entirely<br>
conventional. One disadvantage with this arrangement is that high levels of<br>
fluid flow can often not be obtained due to the design of the valve. That is, the<br>
valve itself is solid and fluid can flow only about the edge of the valve when<br>
the valve is opened. Another disadvantage is the lack of sterilisation around<br>
the inlet part of the valve.<br>
A serious disadvantage with many existing one-way valves is<br>
that fluid can flow back into the valve from the body cavity or the body in<br>
which the needle etc has penetrated. This results in contamination, and a<br>
potential health hazard. Most valves are provided with some form of spring or<br>
bias to naturally bias the valve back into the closed position. Therefore, there<br><br>
would be a great advantage if it was possible to provide a one-way valve (for<br>
instance a needle free access valve) where there is little or no likelihood of<br>
backflow occurring upon removal or retraction of the syringe (or other device)<br>
to which the valve is attached.<br>
Other disadvantages with conventional valves are the production<br>
costs, the relatively large number of components making up the valve, the<br>
difficulty in mass production of the valve.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a valve assembly for<br>
use in the medical field and which can reduce or entirely prevent the<br>
occurrence of backflow from the body cavity etc back into the valve assembly.<br>
It is further object of the invention to provide a valve assembly<br>
that may at least partially overcome the abovementioned disadvantages or<br>
provide the public with a useful or commercial choice.<br>
In one form, the invention resides in a valve assembly that<br>
comprises:<br>
1.	An inlet and an outlet,<br>
2.	A flow pathway that extends through the valve assembly from<br>
the inlet to the outlet,<br>
3.	A plunger that is positioned in the flow pathway and which can<br>
move between a forward open position where fluid can flow from the inlet to<br>
the outlet, and a retracted closed position where fluid is prevented from<br>
flowing from the inlet to the outlet, the plunger having a forward portion,<br>
4.	An at least partially elastic sock that has an outer end fixed to<br>
the valve assembly, and an inner portion which engages with the plunger<br>
such that reciprocation of the plunger from the retracted position to the<br>
forward position causes at least part of the sock to stretch, and<br>
5.	A variable volume chamber having walls defined by the plunger<br>
and the sock, the chamber forming part of the flow pathway, the chamber<br>
having smaller or nil volume when the plunger is in the retracted position, and<br>
a larger volume when the plunger is in the extended position, whereby upon<br>
retraction of the plunger, the variable volume chamber reduces in volume<br>
which results in a pumping action to pump fluid through the fluid pathway<br><br>
towards the outlet, thereby reducing or preventing backflow.<br>
With this arrangement, the apparatus can be attached to a<br>
syringe (or other device), and a needle, catheter or other body-injecting<br>
device can be attached to the apparatus. The contents of the syringe can<br>
then be passed through the apparatus and into the body by depressing the<br>
plunger into the forward (open) position. As the plunger moves towards the<br>
forward position, it stretches at least part of the sock and the variable volume<br>
chamber adopts the larger volume. However once the syringe is removed, or<br>
retracted, the sock retracts to its initial position, causing the plunger to be<br>
pushed back into the closed position and at the same time contracting the<br>
variable volume chamber. The contraction causes a positive pressure inside<br>
the apparatus that means that backflow does not occur. Indeed, it is found<br>
that the positive pressure is sufficient to at least partially "pump" any residual<br>
fluid in the apparatus through the outlet upon retraction of the plunger. This is<br>
in contrast to known devices where retraction of the plunger or closure of the<br>
valve often allows backflow of fluid through the outlet and into the valve<br>
apparatus.<br>
The valve assembly may have an outer body formed in two<br>
parts that are attached together. The two parts may comprise a top part, and<br>
a base part. The top part is substantially hollow and suitably contains an<br>
outer passageway of smaller diameter or cross-section, and an inner<br>
passageway of larger diameter or cross-section, the inner passageway<br>
forming part of an internal chamber. The outer passageway may contain<br>
longitudinal slots or recesses that comprise fluid ports the reason for which<br>
will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The base part may be substantially hollow and may contain a<br>
outer passageway of smaller diameter or cross-section, and an inner<br>
passageway of larger cross-section or diameter and which forms part of the<br>
internal chamber that is also defined by the top part. Thus, when the two<br>
parts are attached, there is provided a substantially central internal chamber.<br>
The outer passageway of the base part may be surrounded by attachments to<br>
allow the outlet to attach to a needle etc.<br>
The apparatus has a flow pathway that extends through the<br><br>
valve assembly from the inlet to the outlet, and typically through the central<br>
internal chamber described above.<br>
The apparatus has a plunger. The plunger is moveable<br>
between a forward open position where the plunger moves more towards the<br>
outlet, and a retracted closed position where the plunger is more towards the<br>
inlet. The plunger typically slides or reciprocates between the two positions.<br>
The plunger has a forward portion which is typically a projecting<br>
nose portion. Suitably, the plunger also has a rear body portion. The nose<br>
portion and the body portion may be formed integrally. The plunger suitably<br>
has a fluid flow pathway extending at least partially therethrough. The fluid<br>
flow pathway may comprise an internal flow passageway extending through<br>
the nose portion which means that the nose portion may have an open outer<br>
end. Suitably, the internal flow passageway includes a transverse through<br>
bore in the rear body portion such that fluid can pass through the through<br>
bore and through the flow passageway that extends through the nose portion.<br>
The rear body portion of the plunger is typically configured and<br>
dimensioned to substantially fill the outer passageway in the top part of the<br>
valve assembly. Suitably, the rear body portion has an end face that is<br>
substantially flush with the end of the top part of the valve assembly that can<br>
make cleaning of this area quite easy. The rear body portion typically has a<br>
sealing face extending about the rear body adjacent the end face and which<br>
seals with the internal wall of the outer passageway.<br>
The plunger may an engagement means to engage with the<br>
elastic sock. The engagement means may comprise an annular step or<br>
shoulder portion on the plunger and which can catch against or engage with<br>
the elastic sock upon forward movement of the plunger. Alternatively, the<br>
plunger can push against the sock.<br>
The apparatus has an at least partially elastic sock. The sock<br>
may be formed of a rubbery elastic material having a good memory. In one<br>
form of the invention, the sock may be formed as a separate component.<br>
The elastic sock may comprise a substantially circular base portion, and an<br>
extending tubular wall portion. The base portion and the wall portion may be<br>
formed integrally. The wall portion may extend substantially about the nose<br><br>
portion of the plunger. The base portion may have a peripheral edge that is<br>
held against movement in the valve assembly. Suitably, the peripheral edge<br>
also comprises a sealing edge. Preferably, the base portion is elastic and<br>
can therefore be stretched upon forward movement of the plunger.<br>
Preferably, the tubular wall portion is compressible or is otherwise configured<br>
to allow it to be shortened in length, for instance by allowing the wall portion<br>
to buckle in a controlled manner. The wall portion may be provided with<br>
circumferential recesses that provide zones to allow a controlled buckling of<br>
the wall portion. The end of the tubular wall portion may be provided with a<br>
sealing lip or a sealing bead that seals against the base portion of the valve<br>
assembly.<br>
Alternatively, the sock may have a substantial disklike<br>
configuration without a tubular wall portion. In this embodiment, the sock may<br>
have an outer peripheral edge that is attached to the valve assembly in a<br>
manner similar to that described above. The sock may have an internal<br>
opening, which is typically a central opening and through which part of the<br>
plunger can pass, which is typically a nose portion of the plunger. If desired,<br>
the plunger may be provided with an annular recess to capture the wall of the<br>
internal opening. With this arrangement, the plunger may be provided with<br>
seals.<br>

BEST MODE<br>
Referring to the drawings, and initially to figure 1, there is<br>
illustrated a valve assembly which comprises an inlet 10 and an outlet 11, a<br>
flow pathway that extends through the valve assembly from inlet 10 to outlet<br>
11, a plunger 12 that is positioned in the flow pathway and which can<br>
reciprocate between a forward open position illustrated in figure 3, and a<br>
retracted closed position illustrated in figure 2, the plunger having an elongate<br>
forward nose portion 13, an elastic sock 14 which is adapted to extend at<br>
least partially about the nose portion 13 of plunger 12, engagement means 15<br>
to engage the plunger to the sock, and a variable volume chamber 16 best<br>
illustrated in figure 3 (where the chamber is of maximum volume), but also<br>
just visible in figure 2 (where the chamber is of minimal and almost having a<br>
zero volume).<br>
Referring to the parts in greater detail, the valve assembly in the<br>
embodiment comprises an outer body that is formed of two parts that are<br>
attached together, the two parts being a top part 17 and a base part 18.<br>
These parts are formed of plastic material and are joined together by any<br>
suitable method. Top part 17 is best illustrated in figure 1 and is substantially<br>
hollow. Top part 17 comprises an outer passageway 19 which is circular and<br>
which has a smaller diameter, and an inner passageway 20 which is also<br>
circular and which has a substantially larger diameter. Similarly, base part 18<br>
has an inner passageway 21 that has a substantially larger diameter than<br>
outer passageway 22. When the two parts are joined as illustrated in figure 2<br>
and figure 3, the two larger diameter passageways together form an internal<br>
chamber 23. Outer passageway 22 terminates in outlet 11, while outer<br>
passageway 19 terminates in inlet 10.<br>
The outer passageway 19 in top part 17 contains a plurality of<br><br>
longitudinal open ended fluid ports 24. Ports 24 comprise recesses in the<br>
wall of outer passageway 19 and are open ended which means that the ports<br>
communicate with chamber 16. The ports 24 do not extend entirely along the<br>
wall of passageway 19. Rather, the ports terminate partway along the wall<br>
such that a smooth wall portion 25 extends between the end of ports 24 and<br>
inlet 10. The reason for this will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Base part 18 contains a standard luer lock fitting 26 which<br>
extends about passageway 22 and which functions to allow a needle etc to be<br>
attached to this part of the assembly. Of course, other types of attachments<br>
can also be used.<br>
Inner passageway 21 has a diameter that is smaller than inner<br>
passageway 20. Thus, the wall 27 of inner passageway 21 passes into inner<br>
passageway 20 this being best illustrated in figure 2. Moreover, wall 27 has a<br>
length that results in the wall 27 being spaced somewhat from wall 28 of top<br>
part 17 (see figure 2). This spacing facilitates the attachment of the elastic<br>
sock that will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Plunger 12 is formed of plastic material and comprises a unitary<br>
body. The plunger has a particular configuration that provides a nose portion<br>
13, and a rear body portion 29. Nose portion 13 is slightly tapered and has a<br>
through passageway 30 which passes through an open outer end 31 and<br>
functions to allow fluid to flow through the valve assembly. Body portion 29 is<br>
provided with a transverse through bore 32 through which fluid can pass.<br>
Body portion 29 has a substantially cylindrical outer wall provided with a<br>
sealing area or collar 35. This is why the fluid ports 24 in end wall 25<br>
terminate short of inlet 10 to also provide a smooth area which functions as a<br>
sealing zone 36. Thus, when the plunger is in the closed position illustrated<br>
in figure 2, the sealing collar 35 seals against the sealing zone 36 to provide<br>
seal against fluid flow.<br>
When plunger 12 is pushed forwardly from the position<br>
illustrated in figure 2 to the position illustrated in figure 3 and 4, the plunger<br>
only moves by a few mm, but this movement is sufficient to move collar 35<br>
away from sealing zone 36 and into the area of the flow ports 24 and to allow<br>
fluid to pass along the outside wall of body portion 29, through the fluid ports<br><br>
24, through bore 32 through passageway 30 and through outlet 11.<br>
Conversely, when the plunger is retracted from the position illustrated in<br>
figure 3 to the position illustrated in figure 2 the plunger again seals against<br>
passage of fluid from inlet 10 through outlet 11,<br>
Fluid only flows when the flow ports 24 are opened by collar 35<br>
moving past the outer most edge of the flow ports. At all other times a seal is<br>
maintained between the internal wall 25 and collar 35.<br>
The plunger is biased back to its retracted position by the elastic<br>
sock 14 which also provide additional functions. Elastic sock 14 is made of a<br>
rubbery elastic material having an excellent memory. The elastic sock has a<br>
circular base portion 39 and an extending tubular wall portion 40. The elastic<br>
sock, when in the rest position, adopts the configuration illustrated in figure 1.<br>
The base portion is made of a stretchable and elastic material. The base<br>
portion has a peripheral edge 41 that is thickened with respect to the<br>
thickness of the base portion immediately next to the peripheral edge.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates attachment of the sock to the apparatus and<br>
shows how the thickened peripheral edge 41 is trapped between wall 27 of<br>
base part 18 and the inner wall of top part 17. The area of the base part<br>
between the peripheral edge and the tubular wall portion 40 is quite elastic<br>
and can stretch. Peripheral edge 41 also functions to seal the fluid pathway<br>
in the apparatus. The outer end of tubular wall portion 40 is provided with an<br>
annular sealing lip 45 that fits within an annular recess 46 formed in base part<br>
18 (see figure 2).<br>
The plunger 12 has an engagement means 15 that comprises<br>
an annular shoulder extending from the base of nose portion 13. The annular<br>
shoulder sits behind base portion 39, this being best illustrated in figure 2.<br>
Thus, when the plunger 12 is pushed forwardly from the position illustrated in<br>
figure 2 to the position illustrated in figure 3, the engagement means 15 will<br>
push base portion 39 forwardly. As the peripheral edge 41 is trapped in<br>
place, the base portion will begin to stretch this being best illustrated in figure<br>
3. As this occurs, a chamber 16 (called the variable volume chamber) opens<br>
up from a very small or zero volume best illustrated in figure 2, to a larger<br>
volume best illustrated in figures 3 and 4. This chamber 16 forms part of the<br><br>
fluid flow pathway that means that fluid fills or can at least partially fill<br>
chamber 16. Of course, upon removal of the syringe tip (which pushes the<br>
plunger forwardly) from the apparatus, the plunger is pulled back into the<br>
retracted position by virtue of the stretched base portion 39 shrinking back to<br>
its rest position. This action reduces the volume of chamber 16 and causes<br>
any fluid in the chamber to be "pumped" or squeezed through flow<br>
passageway 30 and through outlet 11.<br>
The sock is designed such that when the plunger 12 is in the<br>
retracted closed position, there is still some tension in the sock to keep the<br>
plunger in the retracted position.<br>
The tubular wall portion 40 of the sock has an array of spaced<br>
circumferential grooves 43 which are best illustrated in figure 1 and figure 2.<br>
These grooves facilitate a control buckling of the tubular wall portion 40 from<br>
a substantially unbuckled position illustrated in figure 2, to a buckled position<br>
illustrated in figure 3. The buckling compensates for the stretching of base<br>
portion 39. The tubular wall portion (also called the sock stem) has a natural<br>
position and memory to retain the position illustrated in figure 2. Thus, when<br>
the wall portion adopts the buckled position illustrated in figure 3, it also<br>
assists in pushing back to the plunger as soon as the syringe (or other type of<br>
device) is removed from inlet 10.<br>
Referring to figure 4, when the plunger 12 is in the fully open<br>
position, the plunger nose seals against annular sealing lip 45.<br>
Figures 5-7 illustrate another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
primary difference being the configuration of the elastic sock on the plunger.<br>
Like parts have been given like numbers.<br>
In this embodiment, plunger 47 is substantially similar to the<br>
plunger described above except that the nose portion 48 contains a O ring<br>
seal 49 which is in sliding engagement with the inside wall of outer<br>
passageway 22 thereby preventing fluid from flowing along the outside wall of<br>
the nose portion 48. The plunger supports an elastic sock 51 that is disklike<br>
in configuration, and differs from the elastic sock described above in that<br>
there is no tubular portion. The sock 51 again has an outer peripheral<br>
thickened sealing edge 52 that is trapped in the valve housing as illustrated in<br><br>
figure 6 and figure 7.<br>
As plunger 47 moves from its retracted position illustrated in<br>
figure 6 to the extended position illustrated in figure 7, the movement causes<br>
the elastic sock 51 to stretch. This stretching action increases the volume of<br>
the variable volume chamber 16. When the syringe tip (not illustrated) or<br>
other similar device is removed from inlet 10, plunger 47 will then be retracted<br>
back to the closed position illustrated in figure 6 by virtue of the bias provided<br>
by the stretched sock. Additionally, shrinking of the sock back to its initial<br>
position will reduce the volume of chamber 16 that provides the positive<br>
pressure to prevent backflow. A further O ring 55 is positioned on the outer<br>
edge of plunger 47.<br>
In each embodiment, a small air passageway 56 is provided to<br>
allow air to pass into chamber 23 upon shrinking of the sock and to allow air<br>
to pass out of chamber 23 upon stretching of the sock.<br>
The valve assembly prevents back flow of fluids by maintaining<br>
a positive pressure in chamber 16.<br>
Referring to figures 8 and 9 there is illustrated an anti-siphon<br>
means that can be fitted to a valve assembly which is described in Australian<br>
patent 736326 the specification of which is incorporated herein by cross<br>
reference. In this embodiment, the anti-siphon means includes a sleeve 64<br>
which fits generally in a bottom casing 69 which is one part of a two part<br>
housing. Sleeve 64 can be formed from an elastic material or a material that<br>
is elastic in the region where the sleeve contacts opening fingers 74.<br>
Suitably, the sleeve is formed from SANTOPRENE or similar material.<br>
Sleeve 64 has an inner portion which is dish shaped 75 and an outer portion<br>
69 which is in the shape of a tube and which extends along the inside wall of<br>
spigot 71, and terminates in a small lip 72 which extends over the front end of<br>
spigot 71 to hold the sleeve in place. Inner portion 75 of the sleeve is sealed<br>
to the innermost annular land portion 65 of bottom casing 69. Thus, the<br>
sleeve can be positioned in bottom casing 69 prior to bottom casing 69 being<br>
attached to top casing 62. A small annular thickened portion 66 is provided<br>
on the sleeve where the dish shaped portion 75 joins or becomes part of the<br>
outer portion 69. Suitably, the entire sleeve is formed from a single piece of<br><br>
material.<br>
The sleeve is designed to naturally adopt a position illustrated in<br>
figure 8 where it abuts against, or is closely spaced from fingers 74. In this<br>
position, the sleeve isolates the fluid pathway from the remainder of chamber<br>
67. When valve member 61 is pushed forwardly, the arrangement adopts the<br>
position illustrated in figure 9. As valve member is pushed forwardly, it<br>
deforms or pushes apart fingers 74. Fingers 74 in turn push back/stretch<br>
sleeve 64 into chamber 67. This action causes air in chamber 67 to be<br>
vented from the chamber through a small vent opening 68. Vent 68 in the<br>
particular embodiment illustrated in figure 8 and figure 9 extends between<br>
chamber 67 and outlet 73. Specifically, vent 68 passes between chamber 67<br>
and the threads 70 in the internal passageway. An advantage in having the<br>
vent in this position is that it cannot be clogged by any cleaning/wiping of the<br>
exterior of the valve assembly. Of course, it is possible for vent 68 to vent air<br>
from chamber 67 to any convenient outer part of the valve assembly.<br>
When valve member [plunger] 61 is pushed forwardly, fluid can<br>
now pass from inlet 60 through outlet 73. When valve member 61 is pushed<br>
back from the position illustrated in figure 9 to the position illustrated in figure<br>
8, the stretched sleeve 64 will shrink back to the position illustrated in figure 8,<br>
and will stay abutting against or closely spaced from the fingers 74/valve<br>
member 61. As this occurs, air will pass through vent 68 and into chamber 67<br>
to equalise the pressure. Thus, air will pass through vent 76 and not through<br>
outlet 16. The effect of this is that as valve member 61 is retracted, fluid will<br>
not suck back through outlet 73 as air will move preferentially into chamber 67<br>
through vent 68. The reason for this is that outlet 73 will usually be<br>
connected to some form of needle assembly or body access means and it is<br>
much more difficult to suck fluid back through outlet 73 then to have air<br>
passing through vent 68. Thus, the arrangement functions as an anti- siphon<br>
means to prevent body fluid (for instance blood) from being sucked back into<br>
the valve assembly.<br>
Another advantage with the arrangement is that possibly<br>
contaminated air is kept separate from the fluid flow pathway of the valve<br>
assembly by virtue of the sleeve 64.<br><br>
It should be appreciated that various other changes and<br>
modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A valve assembly for use with a syringe and which prevents<br>
backflow that comprises an inlet (10) and an outlet (11), a flow pathway that<br>
extends through the valve assembly from the inlet (10) to the outlet (11), a<br>
plunger (12) that is positioned in the flow pathway and which can move<br>
between a forward open position where fluid can flow from the inlet (10) to the<br>
outlet (11), and a retracted closed position where fluid is prevented from<br>
flowing from the inlet (10) to the outlet (11), the plunger (12) having a fluid<br>
flow pathway extending at least partially therethrough or therealong, the<br>
plunger (12) having a forward portion (13), an at least partially elastic sock<br>
(14) that has an outer end fixed to the valve assembly, and an inner portion<br>
which engages with the plunger (12) such that reciprocation of the plunger<br>
(12) from the retracted position to the forward position causes at least part of<br>
the sock (14) to stretch, and a variable volume chamber (16) having walls<br>
defined by the plunger (12) and the sock (14), the chamber (16) forming part<br>
of the flow pathway, the chamber (16) having smaller or nil volume when the<br>
plunger (12) is in the retracted position, and a larger volume when the plunger<br>
(12) is in the extended position, characterised in that, upon retraction of the<br>
plunger (12), the variable volume chamber (16) reduces in volume which<br>
results in a pumping action to pump fluid through the fluid pathway towards<br>
the outlet (11), thereby reducing or preventing backflow.<br>
2.	The assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the valve assembly<br>
has an outer body formed in two parts that are attached together.<br>
3.	The assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein one of the two<br>
parts comprises a top part (17) having an outer passageway (19) of smaller<br>
diameter or cross-section, and an inner passageway (20) of larger diameter<br>
or cross-section, the inner passageway (20) forming part of an internal<br>
chamber (16).<br>
4.	The assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein the outer<br>
passageway (19) contains at least one longitudinal slot or recess that<br>
comprise fluid ports (24).<br>
