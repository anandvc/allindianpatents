This invpnticn relates tn a process for the preparation of bisphenoi H- giycidyi methacrylate for use in a visible light cured composite for dental restorat ive purposes.<br>
This application has been divided out of parent- patent applica¬tion Na.279/Mas/93 of 26.4.93.<br>
Visible light cured composites are used as an aesthetic dental restorative. Such composites comprise a single paste system which is activated by exposing to intense blue light of the spectrum. Once it is activated) the paste gets cured in a few minutes. The system is widely accepted as it has several advantages) such as excellent shelf life, ease of handlingi less discoloration from ini tlator and an unlimi ted working time.<br>
An object or this invention is to propose an improved process for the preparation of a visible light cured composi te for dental restorst ive purposes.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a visible light cured composite having a di ametral tensile strength of 35-37 MPa•<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of'a visible light cured composite having a compress!ve strength of 220-240 MPa.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process  for the  preparation of a visible light cured composite which has  an aesthet ic   appearance. According to this invention, there is provided a process for  the<br><br>
preparation  of  bisphenol A-glyeidyl methacrylate  (bis-GMA)  by<br>
condensation reaction between Diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A and<br>
Methacryl ic  acid  in the1 presence, of a catalyst such  as  herein<br>
o described  at  a  temperature in the range of 75 to  85 C  for  a<br>
period  of  S  to 12 hrs. and recovering the pure  b is-GMA  in  a<br>
manner such as herein described.<br>
The bisphenol A-glye idyl mathaery late ibis—8MA&gt; thus prepared  is<br>
used  for  the  preparation  of  visible  light  cured  composi fce<br>
materials*  which  can be used for  restorati ve  and  orthodontic<br>
applications in dentistry. Preparation of the visible light cured<br>
composite comprises in the steps of s<br>
x■      preparing a resin mixture by the- addition of resins  such  as<br>
bisphenolA-glycidyl  methacrylate (Bis-SfIA), its  derivatives  or<br>
any  aromatic  dimethacryiates  and at  least  an  initiator  and<br>
accelerator, said accelerator selected from aromatic amines such<br>
as herein described j<br>
ii,  preparing a visible light.curing paste by adding said  resin<br>
•nixture  to a filler such as silane treated quartz and mixing  in<br>
the absence of sunliqht;<br>
'iii.  subjecting the paste to exposure in a visible light  source<br>
emitting blue light.<br>
This  is  in the form of a high viscous paste  which  is  applied<br>
directly  to the site of application and cured in situ  with  the<br>
help of a light source.<br><br>
Resin Synthesis<br>
The base resin can be 2,2-bis /_4- 
oxy-propoxy)-7 phenyl propane <bisphenol a-glycidyl methacrylate></bisphenol>
or Bis-GMA&gt;, its derivatives or any aromatic dimethacrylates.<br>
Bis-SMA is synthesised by the condensation reaction of Diglycidyl<br>
ether of Bisphenol-A and methacrylic acid by taking in trie molar<br>
ratio 1 s2. 1« "f he reaction is. catalysed by aromatic terti ary<br>
amines like N,N Dimethy1-p-toluidine at 60 C in an inert<br>
atmosphere. The reaction proouct is diluted with extra pure<br>
methylene chloride and washed with dilute sodium hydroxide and<br>
hydrochloric acid followed by distilled water, followed by drying<br>
by standard procedure such as tui th anhydrous sodium sulphate or<br>
by vacuum distillation.<br>
The resin solution 	 	<br><br>
in iiiuLiiyj-ene cnioiriQe xs tnen mnioitect with bU ppm of hydroquxnone, its derivatives or any hindered phenols. The .methylene chloride is removed by a flash evaporator under vacuum at a temperature of 60 °C.<br>
Filler Preparation<br>
Several kinds of fillers are employed in Bis-GMA based composites, said fillers selected  from Quartz, Borosilicate glasses, lithium aluminium silicates and various aluminosilicate glasses.  Also glasses containing radiopaque salts, rnicrofine fillers like fumed silica or silicon dioxide can be employed as fillers.  The filler must be inert, hard, without colour and reinforcing. Depending upon the source it may require purification/ grading, etc. The purified material may be treated with coupling  agents to improve interfacial bonding between the filler and the resin.  The coupling agents generally used are silanes.<br>
The quartz obtained from local source is graded by using a seiving mechine/sedimentation, purified by washing with 75% hydrochloric acid and calcination at 800°C. The graded quartz powder of particle size below 20 microns are treated with trimethoxyl silyl propyl methacrylate (1% w/w of filler) from low volatile<br><br>
solvents like acetone.  The acetone has been removed -by stirring and  subsequent drying at 70°C or any appropriate temperature. Resin mixture preparation<br>
Since the resin is a highly viscous fluid/ the handling and incorporation of filler will be difficult. So it is essential to add low viscosity reactive diluents like di~or multifunctional methacrylates or similar monomers with unsaturation. Initiators can be alpha diketones which will be activated with visible light.  Rate of initiation may be speeded up by adding electron donating species like tertiary amines. The premature polymerisation is prevented by adding inhibitors like quinones* hindered ph-anbls etc.  Also stability to UV light and colour may be achieved by adding phenyl salicylate or 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxi bensophenone.  Here 70 parts of Bis-GMA is mixed with 30 parts of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate.  0.25 parts each of camphorquinone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine are<br>
'i<br>
added   as   the .initiator   system.      The  mixture   is   then inhibited     with   0.09   parts   of   butylated   hydroxy   toluene. 0.09   parts   of   phenyl   salicylate   and   0.04   parts   of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy   benzophenone  are  added   as   stabilizers. The   resulting   mixture   is   thoroughly   mixed   to  di3solve the   additives   and   to   get   a   homogenous   mixture.      This   is<br><br>
termed as resin mixture.<br>
Preparation of visible light curing paste<br>
25 parts of the above resin mixture is taken<br>
and mixed with 72 parts of silane treated quartz.  An<br>
amount of 3 parts by weight of silane treated pyrogenic silica is added to prevent the filler sedimentation and i<br>
thoroughly in the absence of sunlight to get a homogenous paste.<br>
Composite<br>
The paste thus prepared is subj ected to exposure in a  visible light source emitting blue light of wave length in the region 440-480 nm resulting in a hardened composite.  The composite when tested for mechai properties according to  American Dental Association Specification No.27 gives a Diametral Tensile Strength 35-40 MP a and Compressive Strength of 200-230 MPa.<br>
The process of the present invention will be better understood by a reference  to Fig.l accompanying drawing.  Fig. 1 illustrates the flow chart of the process of the present invention.<br>
The composite prepared by the process of the present invention and as described herein has the follow: properties:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
