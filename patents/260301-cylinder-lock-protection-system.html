DESCRIPTION CYLINDER LOCK PROTECTION SYSTEM TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a cylinder lock protection system that, when a magnet lock that unlocks in response to the approach of a magnet is unlocked, can switch between a state in which insertion of a mechanical key into a key hole of an inner cylinder pivotably supported in a cylinder body is permitted and a state in which insertion of the mechanical key into the key hole is prevented  BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A cylinder lock protection system in which a shutter plate having a key insertion hole with a rectangular cross-section corresponding to a key hole with a rectangular cross-section is pivoted around the same axis as the pivot axis of an inner cylinder by a pivoting operation when unlocking a magnet lock is known from Patent Publication 1, and a cylinder lock protection system in which a shutter plate capable of pivoting around an axis that is parallel to the pivot axis of an inner cylinder and offset from the pivot axis is pivoted by a pivoting operation when unlocking a magnet lock is known from Patent Publication 2. Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent No. 3577453<br>
Patent Publication 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-56219 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] In the arrangement disclosed by Patent Publication 1, in a position in which the shutter plate is closed, the key insertion hole of the shutter plate is at a position intersecting the key hole of the inner cylinder, and a central section of the intersection is not closed; as a result, foreign matter might be forced in via this insertion hole, and dust, etc. might enter the inner cylinder, which is not desirable. [0004] Furthermore, in the arrangement disclosed by Patent Publication 2, since the key hole of the inner cylinder can be closed completely by the shutter plate, the problems of the technique disclosed by Japanese Patent No. 3577453 do not occur.<br><br>
but since the shutter plate is capable of pivoting around the axis that is parallel to the pivot axis of the inner cylinder and offset from the pivot axis, the dimensions of a shutter mechanism that includes the shutter plate are large.<br>
[0005] The present invention has been accomplished under the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a cylinder lock protection system that enables a key hole of an inner cylinder to be completely closed and a shutter mechanism to be made compact. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0006] In order to attain the above object, in accordance   a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cylinder lock protection system that, when a magnet lock that unlocks in response to the approach of a magnet is unlocked, can switch between a state in which insertion of a mechanical key into a key hole of an inner cylinder pivotably supported in a cylinder body is permitted and a state in which insertion of the mechanical key into the key hole is prevented, characterized in that a shutter mechanism is disposed on the cylinder body, the shutter mechanism having a pivoting member and a shutter plate, the pivoting member having an insertion hole for permitting insertion of the mechanical key into the key hole and pivoting around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder in response to a pivoting operation when the magnet lock is unlocked, and the shutter plate being operatively connected to the pivoting member so as to move between an open position in which the insertion hole is opened and a closed position in which the insertion hole is entirely closed in response to pivoting of the pivoting member. [0007] In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the magnet is provided in a key case that detachably mates with the pivoting member and that is capable of pivoting the pivoting member in the mated state, the magnet enabling the magnet lock to be unlocked in a state in which the key case is mated with the pivoting member, the key case retractably holds the mechanical key so that the mechanical key is made to project from the key case and is inserted into the key hole in a state in which the pivoting member is pivoted so as<br><br>
to put the shutter plate into the open position, and an engagement part is provided on the cylinder body side, the engagement part preventing the key case from becoming detached from the pivoting member by engaging with the key case when the mechanical key is made to project from the key case at least after the magnet lock is unlocked and the shutter plate is put into the open position. [0008] In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the second aspect, the engagement part is provided on the cylinder body side so as to engage with the key case when the inner cylinder is in a locked position in order to obtain a vehicle sting lock state and the shutter plate is in the open position. [0009] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the second or third aspect, the engagement part is provided on the cylinder body side so as to engage with the key case when the inner cylinder is in an ON position in order to put a vehicle engine into an ON state.<br>
[0010] In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the shutter mechanism, which is formed as a unit, is slidably inserted into the cylinder body in a direction along the axis of the inner cylinder while applying a pushing force from the front to the inner cylinder, which is axially movably inserted into the cylinder body, a magnet is provided in a key case that detachably mates with the pivoting member and is capable of pivoting the pivoting member in the mated state, the magnet being capable of unlocking the magnet lock in a state in which the key case is mated with the pivoting member, and the key case retractably holds the mechanical key so that the mechanical key is made to project from the key case and is inserted into the key hole in a state in which the pivoting member is pivoted so as to put the shutter plate into the open position.<br>
[0011] In accordance with a sixth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the fifth aspect, a mating recess is formed on the pivoting member, the key case relatively untreatably but detachably mating with the mating recess, and a projection projecting provided on the pivoting member so as to form at least one part of the mating recess is formed in a shape that enables the projection to be gripped in order<br><br>
to manually operate the pivoting member so as to move the shutter plate from the open position to the closed position in a state in which the magnet lock is unlocked. [0012] In accordance with a seventh aspect of the present invention, in addition to any one of the first to sixth aspects, one end part of a lever housed within a key case slidably holding the mechanical key is pivotably supported in the key case, the mechanical key is connected to the other end side of the lever, and an operating knob is connected to a middle section of the lever, the operating knob being disposed on the key case for being manually slid in a direction parallel to the sliding direction of the mechanical key.<br>
[0013] In accordance with an eighth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the seventh aspect, the mechanical key is held by the key case for sliding along a central axis of the key case formed lengthwise along the longitudinal direction of the mechanical key, and the operating knob is disposed between the central axis and a part of said one end of the lever that is pivotably supported by the key case. [0014] In accordance with a ninth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the eighth aspect, the lever is connected to the mechanical key on a side, relative to the central axis, that is opposite the pivotably supported part. EFFECTS OF INVENTION<br>
[0015] In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, the pivoting member pivots around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder, the insertion hole provided in the pivoting member so that the mechanical key can be inserted into the key hole of the inner cylinder can be entirely closed by the shutter plate in response to pivoting of the pivoting member, and it is therefore possible to completely close the insertion hole, which communicates with the key hole of the inner cylinder, and make the shutter mechanism compact.<br>
[0016] In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, when the key case retractably holding the mechanical key is mated with the pivoting member of the shutter mechanism in a state in which the mechanical key is housed, the magnet lock is unlocked by the magnet provided in the key case, and it is therefore possible<br><br>
to move the shutter plate to an open position by means of the key case; in this state, the mechanical key can be made to project from the key case and inserted into the key hole of the inner cylinder. That is, while the key case is mated with the pivoting member of the shutter mechanism, opening of the shutter mechanism and insertion of the mechanical key into the key hole become possible, unlocking of the cylinder lock by the mechanical key also becomes possible, and it is therefore unnecessary to change over the grip of the mechanical key and the key case, thereby enhancing the operability. Moreover, when the mechanical key is made to project from the key case at least after the magnet lock is unlocked and the shutter plate is put into an open position, since engagement of the engagement part on the cylinder body side with the key case prevents the key case from becoming detached from the pivoting member, the orientation of the key case when the mechanical key is inserted into the key hole is stabilized, thereby further enhancing the operability. [0017] In accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since when the inner cylinder is in the locked position, the engagement part is engaged with the key case while the shutter plate is in the open position, and the key case is connected to the cylinder lock, when a vehicle driver leaves a vehicle after obtaining a steering lock state. It is necessary to detach the key case from the cylinder lock by pivoting the key case so as to move the shutter plate toward the closed position side, and the shutter plate is moved to the closed position without fall, thus enhancing the resistance to theft.<br>
[0018] In accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, in a state in which the mechanical key is inserted into the key hole and the inner cylinder is pivoted to the ON position, the key case is prevented from becoming detached from the cylinder lock, and it is possible to reliably hold the inner cylinder in the ON position.<br>
[0019] In accordance with the fifth aspect of the present invention, since when the key case retractably holding the mechanical key is mated with the pivoting member of the shutter mechanism in a state in which the mechanical key is housed, the<br><br>
magnet lock is unlocked by the magnet provided in the key case, it becomes possible to move the shutter plate to the open position by means of the key case, and in this state the mechanical key is made to project from the key case and is inserted into the key hole of the inner cylinder. That is, in a state in which the key case is mated with the pivoting member of the shutter mechanism, opening of the shutter mechanism and Insertion of the mechanical key into the key hole become possible, unlocking of the cylinder lock by the mechanical key also becomes possible, and it Is therefore unnecessary to change over the grip of the mechanical key and the key case, thereby enhancing the operability. Moreover, when the inner cylinder is pushed, the key case may be pushed together with the mechanical key, and a pushing force from the front can be made to act on the Inner cylinder from the key case via the shutter mechanism, thereby enhancing the operability when the inner cylinder is pushed.<br>
[0020] In accordance with the sixth aspect of the present invention, when the key case is detached from the mating recess of the pivoting member while the shutter plate is open, the shutter plate can be moved from the open position to the closed position by carrying out pivoting while gripping the projection forming at least one part of the mating recess, and it is therefore unnecessary to re-mate the key case with the mating recess.<br>
[0021] In accordance with the seventh aspect of the present invention, since the operating knob is connected to a middle section of the lever having one end part pivotably supported by the key case and the other part connected to the mechanical key, the degree of sliding of the operating knob can be made small, thereby enhancing the operability.<br>
[0022] In accordance with the eighth aspect of the present invention, it is possible to arrange the mechanical key on the central axis of the key case while enabling the mechanical key to slide in response to pivoting of the lever.<br>
[0023] Furthermore, in accordance with the ninth aspect of the present invention, it is possible to set the degree of sliding of the mechanical key so as to be large relative<br><br>
to the degree of sliding of the operating knob by setting the distance between a part<br>
of the operating knob connected to the lever and a part of the lever connected to the<br>
mechanical key to be relatively large.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0026] Modes for carrying out the present invention are explained below by reference to embodiments of the present invention shown in the attached drawings. EMB0DIMENT1<br>
[0027] A first embodiment of the present invention is explained by reference to FIG. 1 to FIG. 9; first, in FIG. 1, a cylinder body 11 of a cylinder lock 10 of, for example, a motorcycle is mounted on a steering column (not illustrated), and a body cover 12 made of a non-magnetic material is mounted on a front part of the cylinder body 11, the body cover 12 covering the front part of the cylinder body 11. An inner cylinder 13 is inserted into and supported on the cylinder body 11 while being resiliently urged toward the front side (the left-hand side in FIG. 1), the inner cylinder 13 being capable of pivoting so as to sequentially occupy a LOCK position, an OFF position, and an ON position under conditions such that this is accompanied by pushing when pivoting between the LOCK position and the OFF position. Furthermore, an ignition switch (not illustrated) is mounted on a rear part of the cylinder body 11, the ignition switch changing its switch mode in response to pivoting of the inner cylinder 13 and, moreover, a lock member 14 is slidably supported on the cylinder body 11, the lock member 14 switching between permitting and preventing a turning operation in response to pivoting of the inner cylinder 13.<br>
[0028] The inner cylinder 13 has a bottomed key hole 16 for a legitimate mechanical key 15 to be inserted, and a protector 18 having a through hole 17 communicating with the key hole 16 is disposed within a front part of the cylinder body 11. A plurality, for example, a pair, of engagement collars 18a and 18b are projectingly provided integrally with the protector 18 so as to project radially outward, and these engagement collars 18a and 18b are interposed between an annular step 19 provided on the cylinder body 11 so as to face fonward and a ring plate 20 fixed by swaging in the front end of the cylinder body 11. That is, the protector 18 is supported in the cylinder body 11 so that it can pivot around its axis, and pivoting the legitimate mechanical key 15 inserted from the through hole 17 into the key hole 16<br><br>
makes the protector 18 pivot together with the inner cylinder 13, but when a push operation by the mechanical key 15 is carried out, the inner cylinder 13 is pushed in, leaving the protector 18 behind.<br>
[0029] Latching grooves 21 and 22 are provided in portions of the annular step 19 that correspond to the engagement collars 18a and 18b in the LOCK position, and when something other than the legitimate mechanical key 15, such as a screwdriver, is forcibly pushed into the through hole 17 of the protector 18, the engagement collars 18a and 18b engage with the corresponding latching grooves 21 and 22, thus preventing the protector 18 from pivoting. Furthermore, a coil-shaped spring 23 is provided in a compressed state between the engagement collars 18a and 18b of the protector 18 and the inner cylinder 13, and this spring 23 urges the protector 18 so that the protector 18 does not follow the inner cylinder 13 and move in the axial direction when the inner cylinder 13 is pushed by the legitimate mechanical key 15 in the LOCK position or the OFF position.<br>
[0030] The body cover 12 is provided integrally with a cylindrical protector cover portion 12a surrounding the protector 18, and this protector cover portion 12a also covers a portion of the ring plate 20 that is fixed to the cylinder body 11. [0031] An axially extending engagement groove 24 is provided on an inner face of the cylinder body 11, and a plurality of tumblers 25 are disposed on the inner cylinder 13 so as to be resiliently urged in a direction that makes them engage with the engagement grooves 24, the tumblers 25 disengaging with the engagement groove 24 in response to insertion of the legitimate mechanical key 15 into the key hole 16.<br>
[0032] Referring in addition to FIG. 2 to FIG. 5, the cylinder lock 10 is equipped with a shutter mechanism 26 that, when a magnet lock 35 is unlocked, can switch between a state in which insertion of the mechanical key 15 into the key hole ^p of the inner cylinder 13 is permitted and a state in which insertion of the mechanical key 15 into the key hole 16 is prevented.

hole 33 so as to open on the pivoting member-waw portion 27a side, and a face of<br>
h&gt;ois&amp;. the pivoting member .main portion 27a opposite the case part 30 is provided with two<br>
sets of three engagement recesses 50 so as to correspond respectively to the slide<br>
holes 49 in a state in which substantially one half of the click ball 48 is engaged with<br><br>
each of the engagement recess 44 and the spring housing hole 46 in order to prevent insertion of the mechanical key 15 into the key hole 15. Moreover, the spacing between each set of slide holes 49 as well as the spacing between each set of engagement recesses 50 is set so as to be larger than the pivoting range, for example, 25 degrees, of the pivoting member 27.<br>
[0044] Rod-shaped magnets 51 are siidably mated with slide holes 49 selected from the slide holes 49, in this embodiment two slide holes 49 of each set, so that the arrangement of magnetic poles is in an appropriate combination, and springs 52 for spring-biasing the magnets 51 toward the side where they project from the protruding portions 30f and 30g are disposed between the closed ends of the slide holes 49 and the magnets 51.<br>
[0045] Some of the magnets 51 engage with the corresponding engagement recesses 50 among the engagement recesses 50 on the pivoting member 27 side in a state in which substantially half of the click ball 48 is engaged with each of the engagement recess 44 and the spring housing hole 46, and in this state pivoting of the pivoting member 27 is prevented.<br>
[0046] A magnet key 55 for locking and unlocking the magnet lock 35 is provided in a grip part 54 formed from a synthetic resin so as to cover a part of the mechanical key 15 as shown in FIG. 8, and a number of rod-shaped magnets 57 corresponding to the number of the magnets 51 of the magnet lock 35 are retained in a mating part 56 formed integrally with the grip part 54.<br>
[0047] The mating part 56 is formed in a basically rectangular shape so as to have outer faces at longitudinally opposite ends curved so as to correspond to the inner periphery of the tubular mating portion 27b of the pivoting member 27, and positioning projections 56a and 56b are projectingly provided integrally with the outer faces at the longitudinally opposite ends of the mating part 56, one positioning projection 56a being formed so as to be larger than the other positioning projection 56b.<br><br>
[0048] The tubular mating portion 27b of the pivoting member 27 is provided with a notch 63 and a recess 64, the positioning projection 56a being mated with the notch 63, and the other positioning projection 56b being mated with the recess 64; mating the positioning projections 56a and 56b with the notch 63 and the recess 64 enables the mating part 56 to be positioned and mated within the tubular mating portion 27b. [0049] A pair of arc-shaped recesses 58 and 58 are provided on a face of the mating part 56 opposite the pivoting member 27, and housing recesses 59 respectively corresponding to the two sets of three engagement recesses b/ provided on the pivoting member 27 are provided on the mating part 56 so as to open in the recesses 58.<br>
[0050] Among the housing recesses 59, the magnets 57 are housed in the housing recesses 59 at positions corresponding to the magnets 51 disposed in the case part 30. Open ends of the two recesses 58 are closed by blocking plates 60 made of a non-magnetic material and fixed to the mating part 56.<br>
[0051] The magnets 57 disposed in the mating part 56 are housed in the housing recesses 59 so that the same magnetic pole as that of the pivoting member 27 side of the magnets 51 on the case part 30 side is positioned on the pivoting member 27 side, and when the legitimate magnet key 55 is positioned and mated with the tubular mating portion 27a of the pivoting member 27, the repulsive force between identical magnetic poles pushes the magnets 51 on the case part 30 side into the slide holes 49 so that they move away from the engagement recesses 50 against the spring force of the springs 52, thereby allowing pivoting of the pivoting member 27. [0052] An engagement projection 61 is projectingly provided on the shutter plate 28 slidably mated with the guide recess 41 of the case part 30, the engagement projection 61 projecting toward the pivoting member 27 side and engaging with an arc-shaped guide hole 62 provided in the connection portion 27g of the pivoting member 27. Therefore, when the pivoting member 27 pivots in a state in which pivoting of the pivoting member 27 is permitted, the shutter plate 28 slides so as to follow the pivoting of the pivoting member 27, and can slide between a state in<br><br>
which, when the magnet lock 35 is in a locked state, the shutter plate 28 is in a closed position in which the insertion hole 38 of the pivoting member 27 is entirely closed so as to protect the cylinder lock. 10 (the state in FIG. 2) and a state in which, as shown in FIG. 9, the shutter plate 28 is in an open position in which the insertion hole 38 of the pivoting member 27 is open and insertion of the mechanical key 15 into the key hole 16 of the cylinder lock 10 is permitted.<br>
[0053] The operation of the first embodiment is now explained. The shutter mechanism 26 for protecting the cylinder lock 10 has the insertion hole 38 for allowing the mechanical key 15 to be inserted into the key hole 16 of the inner cylinder 13 of the cylinder lock 10 and also includes the pivoting member 27 pivoting on the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 13 in response to a pivoting operation when the magnet lock 35 is unlocked and the shutter plate 28 operatively connected to the pivoting member 27 so that it moves between the position in which the insertion hole 38 is open and the position in which the insertion hole 38 is entirely closed in response to pivoting of the pivoting member 27.<br>
[0054] That is, the pivoting member 27 pivots around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 13, and since the insertion hole 38 of the pivoting member 27 can be entirely closed by the shutter plate 28 in response to pivoting of the pivoting member 27, it is possible to completely close the insertion hole 38, which communicates with the key hole 16 of the inner cylinder 13, and make the shutter mechanism 26 compact. EMBODIMENT 2<br>
[0055] A second embodiment of the present invention is explained by reference to FIG. 10 to FIG. 28; first, in FIG. 10 to FIG. 12, a cylinder body 66 of a cylinder lock 65 is mounted on a steering column (not illustrated) of, for example, a motorcycle, a front end part (left end parts of FIG. 10 and FIG. 12) of the cylinder body 66 is provided integrally with a forward opening cylindrical portion 66a, and radially outwardly protruding collar portions 66b and 66b are projectingly provided integrally in a plurality of, for example, two positions spaced in the peripheral direction on the<br><br>

The front end part of the cylinder body 66, that is, the cylindrical portion 66a, is covered by a cylindrical body cover 67 having at its front end an inward collar portion 67a radially inwardly protruding from the front end of the cylindrical portion 66a, collar portions 67b and 67b that are on a rear end part of the body cover 67 are mounted on the two collar portions 66b of the cylinder body 66 by means of screw members 68 and 68, and a circular opening 69 that has a smaller diameter than that of the cylindrical portion 66a and is coaxial with the cylindrical portion 66a is formed at the inner peripheral edge of the inward collar portion 67a at the front end of the body cover 67. [0056] Referring in addition to FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, first to third holes 71 to 73 are coaxially provided in a front part of the cylinder body 66, the first to third holes 71 to 73 reducing in diameter stepwise in going axially inward, and an inner cylinder portion 78a of an inner cylinder 78 is fitted into the third hole 73 so that it can slide axially and pivot around the axis. As clearly shown in FIG. 11, this inner cylinder 78 is inserted into and supported by the cylinder body 66 so that it can pivot so as to sequentially occupy a locked position PI, an OFF position P2, and an ON position P4 under conditions such that when pivoting between the locked position PI and the OFF position P2 this is accompanied by pushing, and pushing can be carried out in a seat lock release position P3 set in a middle section between the OFF position P2 and the ON position P4.<br>
[0057] The inner cylinder portion 78a of the inner cylinder 78 is provided with a bottomed key hole 79 having a rectangular cross-section with its front end open and its rear end part closed. An axially extending engagement groove 80 is provided in an inner face of the third hole 73 of the cylinder body 66, and a plurality of tumblers 82 are disposed in the inner cylinder portion 78a of the inner cylinder 78 while being resiliently urged in a direction in which they engage with the engagement grooves 80, the tumblers 82 disengaging from the engagement grooves 80 in response to insertion of a legitimate mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 when the inner cylinder 78 is in the locked position PI or the OFF position P2.<br><br>
[0058] A front part of the inner cylinder 78 is equipped with a cap 99 made of a high hardness material such that an open part at the front end of the key hole 79 is not closed. Furthermore, a collar portion 78e is projectingly provided integrally with a front part of the inner cylinder 78 so as to protrude radially outward, the collar portion 78e being inserted into the second hole 72 while facing from the front an annular receiving step 74 formed on the cylinder body 66 between the second hole 72 and the third hole 73 so as to face fonward.<br>
[0059] Furthermore, a projection 78f connected to the collar portion 78e from the rear is projectingly provided on the outer periphery of a front part of the inner cylinder 78, and this projection 78f engages with the engagement groove 80 of the cylinder body 66 when the inner cylinder 78 in the locked position P1 is forcibly pushed by invalid means, thus preventing pivoting of the inner cylinder 78.<br>
[0060] Referring again to FIG. 10 and FIG. 12, a connecting shaft portion 78b is provided integrally with the rear end of the inner cylinder 78. A switch case 84 of an ignition switch 83 is. mounted on a rear part of the cylinder body 66, and the connecting shaft portion 78b is mated relatively unrotatably but axially slidably with a tubular connecting portion 85a provided integrally with a contact holder 85 of the ignition switch 83. A coil-shaped spring 87 is provided in a compressed state between the contact holder 85 and a retainer 86 mounted on the connecting shaft portion 78b, the spring 87 surrounding the tubular connecting portion 85a and the connecting shaft portion 78b, and the connecting shaft portion 78b, that is, the inner cylinder 78, being resiliently urged forward (leftward in FIG. 10 and FIG. 12). Moreover, a click mechanism 88 for imparting a restraining feel to pivoting of the contact holder 85 in response to pivoting of the inner cylinder 78 is provided between the cylinder body 66 and the contact holder 85.<br>
[0061] A middle section of a lever 90 is pivotably supported on the cylinder body 66 in front of the ignition switch 83 via a support shaft 89 having an axis that is parallel to a plane containing the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 78. A passenger seat is mounted on a vehicle body of the motorcycle in a manner in which it can be opened<br><br>
and closed, the passenger seat enabling a state for a passenger to be seated to be maintained by a seat lock mechanism, and a cable 91 for releasing a locked state of the seat lock mechanism in response to application of a pulling force is connected to one end of the lever 90. Furthermore, a push arm portion 78c is provided integrally with the inner cylinder 78, the push arm portion 78c being capable of exerting a pushing force on the other end of the lever 90 in response to pushing of the inner cylinder 78 in the seat lock release position P3, and when the inner cylinder 78 in the seat lock release position P3 Is pushed the lever 90 is pivoted in the clockwise direction in FIG. 12 by means of the push arm portion 78c, thus pulling the cable 91 and thereby releasing the locked state of the seat lock mechanism. [0062] A lock pin 93 is supported in the cylinder body 66 in front of the push arm portion 78c, the lock pin 93 being capable of sliding within a plane perpendicular to the axis of the inner cylinder 78, and a return spring 94 is provided in a compressed state between the lock pin 93 and the cylinder body 66, the return spring 94 exhibiting a resilient force that urges the lock pin 93 toward the side in which it is drawn into the cylinder body 66. Moreover, the lock pin 93 is connected to the inner cylinder 78 so as to switch between permitting and preventing a turning operation in response to pivoting of the inner cylinder 78. That is, the lock pin 93 is equipped with a connection member 96 having a connection hole 95, through which a crank portion 78d that is integral with the inner cylinder 78 is inserted, and the lock pin 93 slides accompanying pivoting of the inner cylinder 78 between the locked position P1 and the OFF position P2. When the inner cylinder 78 is in the locked position P1, the lock pin 93 is in a projecting position in order to prevent the turning operation, but when the inner cylinder 78 is in the OFF position P2 the lock pin 93 moves back in order to permit the turning operation.<br>
[0063] Referring in addition to FIG. 11 to FIG. 17, a shutter mechanism 104 is disposed within a front part of the cylinder body 66, the shutter mechanism 104 being capable of switching, when a magnet lock 105 is unlocked, between a state in which insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 of the inner cylinder 78<br><br>
is permitted and a state in which insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 is prevented.<br>
[0064] This shutter mechanism 104 includes a pivoting member 107, a shutter plate 108, a holder 109, and a ring member 110, the pivoting member 107 having an insertion hole 106 for allowing insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 of the inner cylinder 78 and pivoting around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 78 in response to a pivoting operation when the magnet lock 105 is unlocked, the shutter plate 108 being operatively connected to the pivoting member 107 so as to move between a position in which the insertion hole 106 is opened in response to pivoting of the pivoting member 107 and a position in which the insertion hole 106 is entirely closed, the holder 109 having in its central section a through hole 111 with a rectangular cross-section corresponding to the key hole 79 of the inner cylinder 78 and supporting the shutter plate 108, the ring member 110 sandwiching the holder 109 between itself and the pivoting member 107, and the shutter mechanism 104 being housed in the first hole 71 of the cylinder body 66 in front of the inner cylinder 78.<br>
[0065] The pivoting member 107 integrally has a disk-shaped pivoting member main portion 107a, a large diameter tubular mating portion 107b, a small diameter tubular mating portion 107d, and a thin cylindrical portion 107e, the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b being formed in a cylindrical shape so that its axially middle section is connected at right angles to the outer periphery of the pivoting member main portion 107a and being mated slidably with the first hole 71 of the front part of the cylinder body 66, the small diameter tubular mating portion 107d being connected flush and coaxial to the inner periphery at the front end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b while forming, between itself and the front end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b, an annular restricting step 107c capable of abutting against the inward collar portion 67a at the front end of the body cover 67 and being mated slidably with the inward collar portion 67a, and the thin cylindrical portion 107e being connected flush and coaxial to the outer periphery at<br><br>
the rear end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b while forming, between itself and the rear end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b, an annular step 107f.<br>
[0066] Furthermore, a cylindrical tubular portion 107g and a guide portion 107h are projectingly provided integrally with a rear face of the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107, the cylindrical tubular portion 107g forming the insertion hole 106, and the guide portion 107h having Its inner end connected to the tubular portion 107g, extending to the outer peripheral side of the pivoting member main portion 107a, and forming an arc-shaped guide groove 112. [0067] The thin cylindrical portion 107e is joined by swaging to an outer peripheral part of the ring plate 110 that abuts against the step 107f of the pivoting member 107, and the ring plate 110 is fixed to the pivoting member 107. Moreover, the holder 109 supporting the shutter plate 108 is disposed between the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107 and the ring plate 110 and housed in a rear part of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b, and is capable of pivoting relative to the pivoting member 107.<br>
[0068] The holder 109 integrally has a disk portion 109a and a pair of engagement leg portions 109b, the disk portion 109a having the through hole 111 provided in its central section and being mated relatively slidably with the rear part of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b so as to face the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107 from the rear side, and the engagement leg portions 109b being connected at right angles to the outer periphery of the disk portion 109a at two positions spaced in the peripheral direction of the disk portion 109a and running through the ring plate 110 so as to extend to the inner cylinder 78 side.<br>
[0069] The disk portion 109a abuts, from the front, against the cap 99 mounted on the collar portion 78e of the inner cylinder 78, and the two engagement leg portions 109b are inserted into and engaged with notches 77 provided in the collar portion 78e in the front part of the inner cylinder 78 as shown in FIG. 18. Therefore, pivoting<br><br>
of the holder 109 is prevented in a state in which pivoting of the inner cylinder 78 is prevented by the tumblers 82 engaging with the engagement groove 80 of the cylinder body 66.<br>
[0070] That is, the shutter mechanism 104 is made as a unit in which the holder 109 supporting the shutter plate 108 is housed between the pivoting member 107 and the ring plate 110 fixed to the pivoting member 107, and the shutter mechanism 104 thus united is inserted into the cylinder body 66 so that it can slide in a direction along the axis of the inner cylinder 78 while applying a pushing force to the inner cylinder 78 from the front.<br>
[0071] The shutter plate 108 is disposed between the insertion hole 106 of the pivoting member 107 and the through hole 111, a guide recess 113 allowing the shutter plate 108 to be slidably mated therewith along a radial direction of the insertion hole 106 is provided on a front side of the disk portion 109a so as to have its inner end part disposed in a substantially central part of the disk portion 109a and its outer end part opening outward on the outer periphery of the disk portion 109a, and the through hole 111 is disposed in an inner end part of the guide recess 113. [0072] An engagement shaft 114 projecting toward the pivoting member 107 side is projectingly provided on the shutter plate 108 slidably mated with the guide recess 113 of the holder 109, and the engagement shaft 114 engages with the arc-shaped guide groove 112 formed within the connection portion 107h of the pivoting member 107. When the pivoting member 107 pivots in a state in which the holder 109 Is in the stationary position and pivoting of the pivoting member 107 is permitted, the shutter plate 108 follows the pivoting of the pivoting member 107 and slides within the guide recess 113; the shutter plate 108 can slide between a closed position (the position shown in FIG. 17) in which the insertion hole 106 of the pivoting member 107 Is entirely closed to thus prevent insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 when the magnet lock 105 is in the locked state, and an open position (the position shown In FIG. 16) that corresponds to pivoting of the pivoting member 107 when the magnet lock 105 is in the unlocked state, and the insertion hole 106 is<br><br>
opened so as to permit insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 when the shutter plate 108 is in the open position.<br>
[0073] A spring 115 is provided in a compressed state between the holder 109 and the cylinder body 66, and In a state in which no external force is being applied to the shutter mechanism 104 from the front, the shutter mechanism 104 is in a forward position in which the restricting step 107c at the front end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b of the pivoting member 107 abuts against the inward collar portionM^a at the front end of the body cover 1-4T^.<br>
[0074] A front end part of the inner cylinder 78 is equipped with a cover 116 that can slide between a position in which the front end of the key hole 79 is closed and a position in which the front end of the key hole 79 is opened, and a spring 117 is provided in a compressed state between the cover 116 and the inner cylinder 78, the spring 117 urging the cover 116 in a direction that closes the front end of the key hole 79. An inner end part of the cover 116 is provided with an inclined face 116a that makes the cover 116 slide in a direction that opens the key hole 79 by being pushed with the extremity of the mechanical key 81.<br>
[0075] Referring again to FIG. 11, the shutter plate 108 is in a closed position PS when the pivoting member 107 is pivoted in a direction opposite to the OFF position P2 by an angle a, for example, 27 degrees from the open position PO in a state in which the insertion hole 106 is opened when the inner cylinder 78 and the holder 109 are in the locked position PI, and when the open position PO is defined as being when the cylinder 78 is in the OFF position P2, the shutter plate 108 is in the closed position PS when the pivoting member 107 is pivoted in a direction opposite to the ON position P4 by an angle a from the open position PO.<br>
[0076] Furthermore, a projection 109c projecting to the pivoting member main portion 107a side of the pivoting member 107 is projectingly provided on the disk portion 109a of the holder 109 outside the closed end of the guide recess 113; this projection 109c is provided with a bottomed spring housing hole 121 opening opposite the pivoting member main portion 107a, and a coil-shaped spring 122<br><br>
having one end abutting against the closed end of the spring housing hole 121 is housed in the spring housing hole 121. Triangularly recessed engagement recesses 123 and 124 are provided in a face of the pivoting member main portion 107a opposite the projection 109c so as to be spaced in the peripheral direction of the pivoting member 107 at positions shown in FIG. 16 and FIG. 17. Moreover, a click ball 125 abuts against the other end of the spring 122, the click ball 125 being capable of switching between a state in which it is housed within the spring housing hole 121 and a state in which substantially one half engages selectively with one of the engagement recesses 123 and 124 and the remaining substantially one half engages with the spring housing hole 121.<br>
[0077] One engagement recess 123 of the two engagement recesses 123 and 124 is in a position in which the substantially one half of the click ball 125 engages therewith when the pivoting member 107 is in the closed position PS, and the other engagement recess 124 is in a position in which the substantially one half of the click ball 125 engages therewith when the pivoting member 107 is in the open position PO, the pivoting member 107 thereby pivoting in a stepped manner between the closed position PS and the open position PO.<br>
[0078] Moreover, the disk portion 109a of the holder 109 is provided integrally with a restricting projection 109d projecting radially outward at a position corresponding to the open end of the guide recess 113, and this restricting projection 109d is inserted into a notch 126 provided at the rear end of the large diameter tubular mating portion 107b of the pivoting member 107. A relative pivoting range between the pivoting member 107 and the holder 109 is therefore restricted by a range within which the restricting projection 109d can be displaced within the notch 126, and the pivoting member 107 does not pivot with a large range that goes beyond the closed position PS or the open position PO relative to the holder 109.<br>
[0079] Furthermore, a pair of protruding portions 109e and 109f are provided integrally with the disk portion 109a of the holder 109 on opposite sides of the guide recess 113, the protruding portions 109e and 109f protruding from the disk portion<br><br>
109a so as to be in the vicinity of and face the pivoting member main portion 107a, and a magnet lock 105 is provided between the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107 and the two protruding portions 109e and 109f. [0080] A pair of bottomed slide holes 127 opening on the pivoting member main portion 107a side are provided in each of the protruding portions 109e and 109f at positions that are symmetrical relative to the center of the holder 109, and two pairs of engagement recesses 128 are provided in the side of the pivoting member main portion 107a facing the protruding portions 109e and 109f, the engagement recesses 128 individually corresponding to each of the slide holes 127 when the shutter mechanism 104 is in a closed state in which insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 is prevented. A gap between each pair of slide holes 127 and a gap between each pair of engagement recesses 128 are set so as to be larger than the pivoting range, for example, 27 degrees, of the pivoting member 107. [0081] Moreover, O rings 129 and 130 are fitted around the protruding portions 109e and 109f so as to surround portions where the slide holes 127 are disposed, and these 0 rings 129 and 130 are interposed between the protruding portions 109e and 109f and the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107. [0082] Rod-shaped magnets 131 are slidably mated with slide holes 127 selected from among the slide holes 127, one of the pair of slide holes 127 provided in one of the protruding portions 109e and both of the pair of slide holes 127 provided in the other protruding portion 109f in this embodiment, so as to give an appropriate combination of magnetic poles, and springs 132 are disposed between closed ends of the slide holes 129 and the magnets 131, the springs 132 spring-biasing the respective magnets 131 so as to project from the protruding portions 109e and 109f. [0083] When the shutter mechanism 104 is in a closed state in which communication between the insertion hole 106 and the through hole 40-is cut off by the shutter plate i/ 108, some of the magnets 131 engage with the corresponding engagement recesses 128 among the engagement recesses 128 on the pivoting member 107 side, and in this state pivoting of the pivoting merpber 107 relative to the holder 109 is prevented.<br><br>
[0084] Referring in addition to FIG. 19 to FIG. 22, magnets 134 for locking and<br>
unlocking the magnet lock 105 are provided in a key case 135 that removably mates<br>
with the pivoting member 107 and that is capable of pivoting the pivoting member<br>
107 in the mated state, and a key unit 136 is formed from this key case 135 and the<br>
mechanical key 81, which is retractably held by the key case 135.<br>
[0085] The key case 135 is formed as a long sheath along the longitudinal direction<br>
of the mechanical key 81 by joining synthetic resin-made first and second case<br>
members 138 and 139 to each other so that the whole of the mechanical key 81 can<br>
be housed therein, and the mechanical key 81 is slidably held between the first and<br>
second case members 138 and -Q©-.<br>
[0086] A wall portion 140 is provided at right angles to and integrally with one end of<br>
the first case member 138 so as to cover one end of the second case member 139,<br>
the wall portion 140 functioning as an end wall, opposite the cylinder lock 44&amp;, of the<br>
key case 135.   The mechanical key 81 is held by the key case 135, which is long<br>
along the longitudinal direction of the mechanical key 81, so that it can slide along a<br>
central axis C of the key case 135, and a rectangular through hole 141 through<br>
which the mechanical key 81 can project and retract is provided in a central section<br>
of the wall portion 140 on the central axis C, the mechanical key 81 being capable of<br>
being inserted through the through hole 141.<br>
ho&gt;v\r\^ one end [0087] The key case 135 houses a lever 142 pivotably supported on a support shaft<br>
A<br>
143 provided on the first case member 138 of the key case 135, the lever 142 being disposed between the mechanical key 81 and the first case member 138. The mechanical key 81 is connected to the other end of the lever 142 on the side opposite to the support shaft 143 relative to the central axis C, and a connecting pin 145 is inserted through and engaged with an oblong connection hole 144 provided on the other end side of the lever 142, the connecting pin 145 being inserted into the mechanical key 81 from the second case member 139 side.<br>
[0088] An end part of the connecting pin 145 projecting from the lever 142 is inserted into a guide groove 146 provided on an inner face of the first case member 138, and<br><br>
the guide groove 146 is formed so as to extend lengthwise along the central axis C of the key case 135. In response to the lever 142 pivoting around the axis of the support shaft 143, the connecting pin 145 moves along the guide groove 146 while changing its position within the connection hole 144 of the lever 142; as shown in FIG. 20, when the connecting pin 145 is positioned in an end part of the guide groove 146 on the side opposite to the wall portion 140, the mechanical key 81 is housed within the key case 135, and as shown in FIG. 23, when the connecting pin 145 is positioned in an end part of the guide groove 146 on the wall portion 140 side, the mechanical key 81 projects from the key case 135.<br>
[0089] An operating knob 147 is connected to a middle section of the lever 142, the operating knob 147 being disposed on the key case 135 so that it can be slid manually in a direction parallel to the sliding direction of the mechanical key 81, and this operating knob 147 is disposed between the central axis C of the key case 135 and one end part of the lever 142 pivotably supported on the key case 135, that is, the support shaft 143, and is slidably in sliding contact with the outer face of the first case member 138.<br>
[0090] A guide hole 148 is provided in the first case member 138 between the support shaft 143 and the central axis C so as to open on the side opposite to the wall portion 140 and extend parallel to the central axis C, and the second case member 139 is provided integrally with a lid portion 139a that is inserted into the guide hole 148 so as to close the open end of the guide hole 148 when joined to the first case member 138.<br>
[0091] The operating knob 147 is provided integrally with a base portion of a connecting shaft 149 running through the guide hole 148. Mating grooves 150 and 150 are provided on opposite sides of the base portion of the connecting shaft 149, the first case member 138 being mated with the mating grooves 150 and 150 on opposite sides of the guide hole 148, and mating the first case member 138 with the two mating grooves 150 allows the operating knob 147 to be disposed in the key case 135 so that it can slide along the central axis C.<br><br>
[0092] An oblong connection hole 151 is provided in a middle section of the lever 142, the connecting shaft 149 being inserted into the connection hole 45t, and sliding the operating knob 147 makes the lever 142 pivot between the position shown in FIG. 20 and the position shown in FIG. 23.<br>
[0093] A bottomed spring housing hole 152 opening on the second case member 139 side is provided in the connecting shaft 149, and a coil-shaped spring 153 having one end abutting against the closed end of the spring housing hole 152 is housed in the spring housing hole 152. Triangularly recessed engagement recesses 154 and 155 are provided in a face of the second case member 139 opposite the connecting shaft 149 so as to be spaced in the sliding direction of the operating knob 147. Moreover, a click ball 156 abuts against the other end of the spring 152, the click ball 156 being capable of switching between a state in which it is housed within the spring housing hole 152 and a state in which substantially one half thereof engages selectively with one of the engagement recesses 154 and 155 and the remaining substantially one half engages with the spring housing hole 152. [0094] One engagement recess 4^ of the two engagement recesses 154 and 4©5- is disposed in a position in which substantially one half of the click ball 156 engages therewith when the operating knob 147 is in the position in which the mechanical key 81 is housed within the key case 135, and the other engagement recess 155 is disposed in a position in which substantially one half of the click ball 156 engages therewith when the operating knob 147 is in the position in which the mechanical key 81 projects from the key case 135, the operating knob 147 thereby sliding in a stepped manner between the position in which the mechanical key 81 is housed within the key case 135 and the position in which the mechanical key 81 projects from the key case 135.<br>
[0095] A mating recess 157 is formed on an outer face of the pivoting member main portion 107a of the pivoting member 107 forming part of the shutter mechanism 104, one end part of the key case 135 including the wall portion 140 being relatively unpivotably but detachably mated with the mating recess 157.   This mating recess<br><br>
157 is formed from a pair of projections 158 and 158 and part of the small diameter tubular mating portion 107d so as to have a substantially rectangular cross-section corresponding to the cross-section of the key case 135, the projections 158 and 158 being projectingly provided integrally with an outer face of the pivoting member main portion 107a on opposite sides of the insertion hole 106 while extending parallel to each other along one diameter of the insertion hole 106 and having opposite ends connected integrally to an inner face of the small diameter tubular mating portion 107d, and at least one part of the mating recess 157, in this embodiment the projections 158 projectingly provided on the pivoting member 107 while forming part of the mating recess 157, is formed in a shape that enables it to be gripped in order to manually operate the pivoting member 107 so as to move the shutter plate 108 from the open position to the closed position in a state in which the magnet lock 105 is unlocked.<br>
[0096] The magnets 134 are disposed at one end of the key case 135, that is, in the wall portion 140, and are mated with the wall portion 140 in positions corresponding to the arrangement of the magnets 131 in the magnet lock 105, and films 159 made of a non-magnetic material for maintaining the state of the magnets 134 mating with the wall portion 140 are affixed to the wall portion 140.<br>
[0097] The magnets 134 are disposed in the wall portion 140 so that the same magnetic poles as the magnetic poles on the key case 135 side of the magnets 131 of the magnet lock 105 are arranged on the magnet lock 105 side; when the key case 135 is mated relatively unrotatably with the mating recess 157 of the pivoting member 107 while the shutter mechanism 104 is in a closed state, the magnets 134 are in proximity to the magnets 131, which are engaged with the engagement recesses 128 in the magnet lock 105, and as a result due to the repulsive force between identical magnetic poles the magnets 131 on the magnet lock 105 side are pushed into the slide holes 127 so as to be detached from the engagement recesses 128 against the spring force of the springs 82, thus unlocking the magnet lock 104 and thereby permitting pivoting of the pivoting member 107.<br><br>
[0098] Engagement grooves 160 and 160 are provided on the outer periphery on<br>
opposite sides in the width direction and close to one end of the key case 135, and<br>
four engagement parts 161 are projectingly provided integrally with the cylinder body<br>
S(&gt;	61	66<br>
446 side, the body cover 447- fixed to the cylinder body 446- in this embodiment, the<br>
engagement parts 161 projecting from the inner periphery of the opening 119 so that<br>
they can engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135 in a state in<br>
which it is mated with the mating recess 157.<br>
[0099] The engagement parts 161 are projectingly provided on the inner periphery of<br>
the opening 119 in positions spaced, for example, at equal intervals of 90 degrees;<br>
IB<br>
when the inner cylinder 426- is in the locked position PI and the shutter plate 108 is in the closed position PS, as shown in FIG. 24, the engagement parts 161 do not engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135, and the key case 135 can be detached from the mating recess 157, but when the shutter plate 108 is in the open position PO, as shown in FIG. 25, two of the engagement parts 161 engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135, thus preventing the key case 135 from becoming detached from the mating recess 157. [0100] When the inner cylinder 426 is in the OFF position P2 and the shutter plate 108 is in the closed position PS, as shown in FIG. 26, the engagement parts 161 do not engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135, and the key case 135 can be detached from the mating recess 157, and also when the shutter plate 108 is in the open position PO, as shown in FIG. 27, the engagement parts 161 do not engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135, and the key case 135 can be detached from the mating recess 157.<br>
[0101] Furthermore, when the inner cylinder 426 is in the ON position P4, as shown in FIG. 28, two of the engagement parts 161 engage with the engagement grooves 160 of the key case 135, thus preventing the key case 135 from becoming detached from the mating recess 157.<br>
[0102] The operation of this second embodiment is now explained. The shutter mechanism 104 includes the pivoting member 107, which has the insertion hole 106<br><br>
for permitting insertion of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 79 of the inner cylinder 78 of the cylinder lock 65 and pivots around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 78 in response to a pivoting operation when the magnet lock<br>
105	is unlocked, and the shutter plate 108, which is operatively connected to the pivoting member 107 so as to move between the position in which the insertion hole<br>
106	is opened and the position in which the insertion hole 106 is entirely closed in response to pivoting of the pivoting member 107. Since the insertion hole 106 of the pivoting member 107 can be entirely closed by the shutter plate 108 in response to pivoting of the pivoting member 27 around the same axis as the pivot axis of the inner cylinder 78, it is possible to completely close the insertion hole 106, which communicates with the key hole 79 of the inner cylinder 78, and make the shutter mechanism 104 compact.<br>
[0103] Furthermore, since the mechanical key 81 is retractably held in the key case 135 provided with the magnets 134 for unlocking the magnet lock 105 so that it is possible to switch between a state in which the whole of the mechanical key 81 is housed and a state in which a length of the mechanical key 81 sufficient for it to be inserted into the key hole 429- is made to project, the degree of freedom in arrangement of the magnets 134 can be increased, and it is possible to make the mechanical key 81 and the magnets 134, together with the key case 135, compact, thus enabling the key unit 136 to be formed as a unit.<br>
[0104] Moreover, since the magnets 134 are disposed in the wall portion 140 forming the end wall of a portion of the key case 135 via which the mechanical key 81 is made to project, the mechanical key 81 can be inserted into the key hole 429-subsequent to unlocking of the magnet lock 105 and opening of the shutter mechanism 104 in a state in which the key case 135 is held so that the magnets 134 face the cylinder lock 496-side in order to unlock the magnet lock 105, and it Is therefore unnecessary to change ovter the grip of the key case 135. [0105] Furthermore, the shutter mechanism 104 has the pivoting member 107, which can pivot around the same axis as that of the inner cylinder 426- and makes the<br><br>
shutter plate 108 operate in response to the pivoting, the magnets 134 are provided<br>
in the wall portion 140 of the key case 135, which is detachably mated with the<br>
pivoting member 107 and can pivot the pivoting member 107 in the mated.state, the<br>
magnets 134 being capable of unlocking the magnet lock 105 in a state in which the<br>
key case 135 is mated with the pivoting member 107, and the mechanical key 81 is<br>
retractably held by the key case 135 so that, in order to insert the mechanical key 81<br>
into the key hole 429; the mechanical key 81 is made to project from the key case<br>
135 in a state in which the pivoting member 107 is pivoted so as to put the shutter<br>
plate 108 into the open position.<br>
[0106] Since the magnet lock 105 is unlocked by the magnets 134 provided in the<br>
key case 135 when the key case 135 is mated with the pivoting member 107 of the<br>
shutter mechanism 104 while the mechanical key 81 is housed, it is possible to pivot<br>
the pivoting member 107 by means of the key case 135 to thus move the shutter<br>
plate 108 to the open position, and in this state the mechanical key 81 is made to<br>
79 project from the key case 135 and is inserted into the key hole 439-of the inner<br>
cylinder 4£©: That is, while the key case 135 is mated with the pivoting member 107<br>
of the shutter mechanism 104, opening of the shutter mechanism 104 and insertion<br>
7^ of the mechanical key 81 into the key hole 42§'can be carried out, and operation of<br>
6S the cylinder lock 4^ by the mechanical key 81  can also be carried out, thus<br>
enhancing the operability.<br>
[0107] Furthermore, since the mechanical key 81 is slidably held by the key case<br>
135, it is easy to switch between a state in which the mechanical key 81 is housed<br>
and a state in which it projects.<br>
[0108] Moreover, the shutter mechanism 104 is made into a unit with the pivoting<br>
member 107, which can pivot around the same axis as that of the inner cylinder 4^<br>
and allows the shutter plate 108 to move between the open position and the closed<br>
position in response to the pivoting, and is slidably inserted into the cylinder body<br>
66	7^<br>
416-in the direction along the axis of the inner cylinder 4-S8 so as to exert a pushing<br>
force on the inner cylinder 4^ from the front.   Therefore, when the inner cylinder<br><br>
n8<br>
42d is pushed, the key case 135 may be pushed together with the mechanical key<br>
81, and a pushing force can be applied to the inner cylinder 4^8 from the front from<br>
the key case 135 via the shutter mechanism 104, thus enhancing the operability<br>
when pushing the inner cylinder 438-.<br>
[0109] Furthermore, the mating recess 157 is formed on the pivoting member 107,<br>
the key case 135 being relatively unrotatably but detachably mated with the mating<br>
recess 157, the projections 158 projectingly provided on the pivoting member 107 so<br>
as to form at least a part of the mating recess 157 are formed in the shape that<br>
enables them to be gripped in order to manually operate the pivoting member 107 so<br>
as to move the shutter plate 108 from the open position to the closed position in a<br>
state in which the magnet lock 105 is unlocked, and it is therefore possible to move f/ie posiiior) of the shutter plate 108^ooition) from the open position to the closed position by<br>
gripping and pivoting the projections 158 when the key case 135 is detached from<br>
the mating recess 157 while the shutter plate 108 is open in the OFF position P2,<br>
thereby making it unnecessary to mate the key case 135 again with the mating<br>
recess 157.<br>
[0110] Moreover, with regard to the key unit 136, since the lever 142 has one end<br>
part pivotably supported by the key case 135 and is housed within the key case 135,<br>
the mechanical key 81 slidably retained by the key case 135 is connected to the<br>
other side of the lever 142, and the operating knob 147 is connected to the middle<br>
section of the lever 142, the operating knob 147 being disposed in the key case 135<br>
so that it can be manually slid in a direction parallel to the sliding direction of the<br>
mechanical key 81, it is possible to reduce the amount of sliding of the operating<br>
knob 147, thus enhancing the operability.<br>
[0111] Furthermore, since the mechanical key 81 is held by the key case 135 so that<br>
It can slide along the central axis C of the key case 135, which is formed lengthwise<br>
along the longitudinal direction of the mechanical key 81, and the operating knob 147<br>
is disposed between the central axis C and one end part of the lever 142 via which it<br>
is pivotably supported on the key case 135, it Is possible to arrange the mechanical<br><br>
key 81 on the central axis C of the key case 135 while enabling the mechanical key<br>
81 to slide in response to pivoting of the lever 142.<br>
[0112] Moreover, since the lever 142 is connected to the mechanical key 81 on the<br>
side, relative to the central axis C, that is opposite the part via which it is pivotably<br>
supported, it is possible to make the distance between the portion connecting the<br>
operating knob 147 to the lever 142 and the portion connecting the lever 142 to the<br>
mechanical key 81 relatively large and to set the amount of sliding of the mechanical<br>
key 81 to be large relative to the amount of sliding of the operating knob 147.<br>
66	65<br>
[0113] Furthermore, the cylinder body 446 side of the cylinder lock 41-5-, in this<br>
61	66<br>
embodiment the body cover 447 fixed to the cylinder body 44©-, is provided with the<br>
engagement parts 161 for preventing the key case 135 from becoming detached<br>
from the pivoting member 107 by engaging with the key case 135 when the.<br>
mechanical key 81 is made to project from the key case 135 at least after the<br>
magnet lock 105 is released and the shutter plate 108 is put into the open position.<br>
It is therefore possible to stabilize the orientation of the key case 135 when the<br>
79 mechanical key 81 is inserted into the key hole 429-, thus further enhancing the<br>
operability.<br>
[0114] Moreover, since, when the inner cylinder 426 is in the locked position P1 and<br>
the shutter plate 108 is in the open position, two of the engagement parts 161<br>
engage with the key case 135, the key case 135 remains connected to the cylinder<br>
6S<br>
lock 445, and when a vehicle driver leaves the vehicle after obtaining a steering lock<br>
state, it is necessary to pivot the key case 135 so as to move the shutter plate 108 to<br>
65 the closed position side and detach the key case 135 from the cylinder lock 44&amp;, and<br>
the shutter plate 85 is always moved to the closed position, thus enhancing the<br>
resistance to theft.<br>
[0115] Furthermore, since, when the inner cylinder 4^ is in the ON position P4, the<br>
engagement parts 161 engage with the key case 135, the key case 135 does not<br>
become detached from the cylinder lock 115 in a state in which the inner cylinder<br>
7^	7*)<br>
426 allows the mechanical key 81 to be inserted into the key hole 429- and the inner<br><br><br>
cylinder 128 is pivoted to the ON position P4, and the inner cylinder 45fr is reliably held in the ON position P4.<br>
[0116] Embodiments of the present invention are explained above, but the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments and may be modified in a variety of ways as long as the modifications do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention described in Claims.<br><br><br>
