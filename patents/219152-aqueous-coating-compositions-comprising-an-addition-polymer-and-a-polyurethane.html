				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an aqueous coating composition comprising an addition polymer and a polyurethane. Preferably, this aqueous coating composition also comprises a metallic pigment, such as aluminium, or a pigment, such as a metal oxide-coated mica, so that coatings with a metallic appearance may be obtained. In this way a differential light reflection effect referred to as "flop" is obtained. A problem with coating systems having a metallic appearance is to obtain a high flop as well as a high gloss.<br>
To obtain a high flop, the metallic pigment on application of the coating composition should be well oriented and remain so. To obtain a high gloss, the metallic pigment-containing coating is provided with an unpigmented so-called clear coat. This system is generally called a "base coat/clear coat" system. In actual practice, the base coat will be sprayed with the clear coat, without prior curing of the base coat {"wet-on-wet"). Since the clear coat usually contains organic solvents, steps should be taken to prevent disorientation of the metallic pigment in the base coat as a result of the base coat being softened by the organic solvents in the dear coat ("strike-in").<br>
An aqueous base coat composition is known from EP-A-0 287 144, i.e. a non-cross-linked core-shell dispersion where the shell, when swollen, provides the desired rheological properties. A decrease in strike-in is observed. However, it has been established that this coating composition needs improvement in respect of several coating properties, such as covering power and drying times.<br>
The present invention now provides an aqueous coating composition which may be used as base coat in a base coat/clear coat system which has good mechanical properties, a high flop, a high gloss, practically no strike-in, and a good water-resistance. Due to the fact that higher solids contents can be achieved with the aqueous coating composition of the present invention, a reduction in drying times and number of coats is obtained. In one or more of<br><br>
these properties the aqueous coating composition of the present invention shows improvement over the one disciosed in EP-A-0 287 144,<br>
The aqueous coating composition according to the invention comprises<br>
5 to 95 wt,% of at ieast one alkali-sweilabie core-shei! addition polymer (1), and<br>
95 to 5 wt.% of at least one polyurethane (If),<br>
the sum of the wt.% indicated for the polymers (I) and {II) always being 100<br>
wt.%.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous coating composition comprises<br>
10 to 90 wt.% of at least one addition polymer (I), and<br>
90 to 10 wt.% of at least one polyurethane (II).<br>
More preferably, the aqueous coating composition comprises<br>
25 to 75 vi/t.% of at least one addition polymer (1), and<br>
75 to 25 wt.% of at least one polyurethane (11).<br>
Preferably, the alkali-sweilable core-shell addition polymer (1) is a copolymer prepared in two or more steps by emulsion polymerization, and is obtained by the copolymerization in a first step of A)       60-95 parts by weight (based on 100 parts by weight of addition polymer)<br>

the sum of the mole% indicated for the monomers (i) and (ii) always<br>
being 100mole%, and by the copolymerizatJon in a subsequent step of B)       5-40 parts by weight (based on 100 parts by weight of addition polymer)<br>
of a monomer mixture B comprising<br>
iii)       10-60 mole% of (meth)acrylic acid and<br>
iv)      40-90   mole%   of  another  copolymerizable,   monoalkylenically unsaturated monomer,<br>
the sum of the mole% indicated for the monomers (iii) and (iv) always<br>
being 100 mole%, with the carboxyiic acid groups derived from the (meth)acrylic acid being at least partially ionized; resulting in a non-cross-linked, alkali-swellable core-shell addition polymer (I).<br>
Such alkali-swellable core-shell addition polymers are known from EP-A-0 287 144.<br>
Preferably, the addition polymer is obtained by the copolymerization of<br>

400, and n stands for a number from 2 to 4, preferably 2 or 3 and more preferably 2. In the above formula Q preferably represents a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, a divalent cyctoaliphatic hydrocarbon group having 5 to 15 carbon atoms, a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms or an araliphatic hydrocarbon group having 7 to 15 carbon atoms.

HDI, IPDI and mixtures of these diisocyanates are particularly preferred.<br>
Component b) includes organic polyhydroxyl compounds having a molecular weight of 300 to 5,000, preferably from 500 to 3.000, and containing at least 50% by weight, preferably more than 70% by weight, of poiyhydroxy polycarbonates. The poiyhydroxy polycarbonates are esters of carbonic acid obtained by the reaction of carbonic acid derivatives, e.g., diphenyl carbonate or phosgene, with diols. Examples of these diols include ethylene glycol, propane-1,2- and 1,3-diol, butane-1,4- and -1,3-diol, hexane-1,6-dlol, octane-1,8-diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-bis-hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-propane-1,3-diol, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-1,3-diol, diethylene glycol, tri- and tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycols, dibutylene glycol, polybutylene glycols, Bisphenol A and tetrabromo Bisphenol A. The diol component preferably contains from 40 to 100% by weight of a hexane diol, preferably hexane-1,6-diol, and/or hexane diol derivatives preferably containing ether or ester groups in addition to terminal OH groups, e.g., the products obtained by the reaction of 1 mole of hexane diol with &gt; 1 mole, preferably 1 to 2 moles, of caprolactone according to DE 17 70 245 or the products obtained<br><br>
by the self-etherification of hexane diol to form dihexylene or trihexylene glycol according to DE 15 70 540. The polyether polycarbonate diols described in DE 37 17 060 are also very suitable.<br>
The hydroxy! polycarbonates should be substantially linear although they may, if desired, be slightly branched by the incorporation of polyfunctional components, in particular low-molecular weight polyols such as glycerol, trimethylol propane, hexane-1,2,6-triol, butane-1,2,4-triol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, quinitol, mannitol and sorbitol, methyl glycoside and 1,4,3,6-dianhydrohexitols.<br>
In addition to the polyhydroxy polycarbonates, starting component b) may<br>
contain other known polyhydroxyl compounds having the previously described<br>
molecular weights, e.g.,<br>
b1) dihydroxy polyesters obtained from dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelalc acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, and from diols such as ethylene glycol, propane-1,2-diol, propane-1,3-diol, diethylene glycol, butane-1,4-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, octane-1,8-diol, neopentyl glycol, 2-methyi propane-1,3-diol and the various isomeric bis-hydroxymethyl cyclohexanes;<br>

Ethylene oxide may be used as a portion of the total quantity of ether molecules, provided the resulting polyether diol contains not more than 10% by weight of ethylene oxide units. It is preferred to use polyether diols<br><br>
which have been obtained without the addition of ethylene oxide, especially those based on propylene oxide and tetrahydrofuran alone.<br>
The optionally used starting components c) are known low-molecular weight compounds which have a molecular weight below 300, contain hydraxyl and/or amino groups, and are at least difuncttonal in isocyanate addition reactions.

Examples of these compounds include low-molecular weight polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propane-1,2- and -1,3-diol, butane-1,4- and -1,3-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, octane-1,8-diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-bis-hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-propane-1,3-diol, 2,2,4-trimethyl penlane-1,3-diol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, the isomeric hexane triols and pentaerythritol; low-molecular weight diamines such as ethylene diamine, 1,2- and 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,3-, 1,4- and 1,6-diamino-hexane, 1,3-diamino-2,2-dlmethyl propane, isophorone diamine, 4,4"-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane, 4,4-diamino-3,3"-dimethyldicyclohexyl methane, 1,4-bis-(2-amino-prop-2-yl)-cyclohexane, hydrazine, hydrazide, and mixtures of such diamines and hydrazines; higher functional polyamines such as diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, dipropylene triamine, and tripropylene tetramine; hydrogenated products of addition of acrylonitrile to aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diamines, preferably those obtained by the addition of an acrylonitrile group to a molecule of a diamine, e.g., hexamethylene propylene triamine, tetramethylene propylene triamine, isophorone propylene triamine or 1,3- or 1,3-cyclohexane propylene triamine, and mixtures of such polyamines.<br>
The hydrophilic starting components d) are compositions containing ethylene oxide units incorporated within polyether chains, specifically: d1) diisocyanates   and/or   compositions   which   contain   isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms and are difunctional in isocyanate polyaddition reactions,<br><br>
the diisocyanates and compositions also containing polyether side chains containing ethylene oxide units, and<br>
d2) monoisocyanates and/or compositions which are monofunctional in isocyanate polyaddition reactions and contain an isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atom, the monoisocyanates and compositions aiso containing terminal polyether chains containing ethylene oxide units, and<br>
d3) mixtures of d1) and d2).<br>
The preparation of these hydrophilic starting components is carried out by<br>
methods   analogous   to   those   described   in   U.S.   3,920,598,   3,905,929,<br>
4,190,566, and 4,237,264.<br>
The compounds used as starting component e) have at least one isocyanate-reactive group and at least one (potentially) ionic group. They include the alcohols-containing tertiary amino groups, hydroxy carboxylic acids, hydroxy sulphonic acids, amino carboxylic acids, and amino sulphonic acids disclosed in U.S. 3,479,310. Instead of these starting components containing potentially ionic groups, the corresponding salt type derivatives thereof may be used, i.e. ionic groups fonned by the quatemization or neutralization of the potentially ionic groups. Examples of suitable quatemizing and neutralizing agents for converting the potentially ionic groups into ionic groups are also set forth in U.S. 3,479,310. When potentially ionic starting components are used, the at least partial conversion of the potentially ionic groups into ionic groups is carried out by quatemization or neutralization after or during preparation of the poiyurethane poiyureas.<br>
Prefen-ed starting components e) include 2,2-bis-(hydroxy-methyl)-alkane monocarboxyiic acids having a total of 5 to 8 carbon atoms and/or salts thereof obtained by partial or complete neutralization with organic amines or NHs- 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid (2,2-bis-hydroxymethyl propionic acid) and/or salts thereof are particularly preferred for use as starting component e).<br><br>
Preparation of the polyurethanes from the starting components a) to e) is carried out in a known manner in one or more stages using the reactants in such proportions that the equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups present in the starting components to isocyanate-reactive groups present in the starting components is 0.8:1 to 2:1, preferably 0.95:1 to 1.5:1, and more preferably 0.95:1 to 1.2:1.<br>
Component d) is used in a quantity such that the polyurethane polyurea contains 0 to 30% by weight, preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, of ethylene oxide units incorporated into temiinal or lateral polyether chains.<br>
The quantity of component e) and the degree of neutralization required to form ionic groups are calculated to ensure that the polyurethane finally obtained contains 0 to 120, preferably 1 to 80 milliequivalents, of ionic groups per 100 g of solids. The total quantity of ethylene oxide units and ionic groups must be sufficient to ensure the dispereibility of the polyurethane polyureas in water.<br>
The reaction of the starting components a) to e) may be carried out In one or more stages, optionally in the presence of an isocyanate-inert, water-miscible solvent, so that the reaction products are obtained in the form of a solution in such a solvent. In this context, the term "solution" denotes either a true solution or a water in oil emulsion which may be formed if, for example, individual starting components are used in the form of aqueous solutions. Examples of suitable solvents include acetone, methylethyl ketone, N-methyl pyrrolidone, and any mixtures of such solvents. These solvents are generally used in such quantities that the reaction products of starting components a) to e) are obtained in the form of 10 to 70 wt.%.<br>
When the preparation of polyurethane polyureas is carried out as a single-stage reaction, the starting components containing isocyanate-reactive groups are preferably mixed together and then reacted with the starting components containing isocyanate groups. This reaction preferably is carried out initially in<br><br>
the absence of solvents at temperatures of 50 to ISCC, optionally in the presence of known catalysts.<br>
The viscosity of the mixture increases during the course of the reaction and one of the above-mentioned solvents is therefore gradually added to the mixture. The polyurethane content of the organic solution finally obtained is adjusted to a concentration of 10 to 70% by weight, in particular 15 to 55% by weight.<br>
When a two-stage process is employed, an isocyanate prepolymer preferably is first prepared solvent-free at about 50 to 150""C from excess quantities of isocyanate-containing starting components and hydroxyl-containing starting components at an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.1:1 to 3.5:1, preferably 1.2:1 to 2.5:1, with or without a solvent, and this isocyanate prepolymer is then taken up in a solvent if no solvent has been used up to this stage. The solution obtained is then further reacted with chain extenders or cross-linking agents c), which are optionally used in the form of aqueous solutions and are preferably starting components of the above-mentioned type containing primary and/or secondary amino groups. The quantity of starting components c) used in the second stage is calculated to ensure that the equivalent ratio of all the starting components used in the first and second stages conforms to the conditions previously stated.<br>
The end products of both variations (single-stage and two-stage) are solutions of the reaction products in the above-mentioned solvent having a solids content within the ranges indicated above.<br>
If any potentially ionic groups are present, their at least partial conversion into ionic groups by quaternization or neutralization is advantageously carried out before the addition of the dispersing water. If starting component e) contains carboxyl groups, which is preferred, in particular dimethylol propionic acid, the neutralizing agents used preferably are tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tri-n-butylamine,  N,N,N-trimethyl  cyclohexylamine,  N-methyl  morpholine,  N-<br><br>
methyi piperazine, N,N-dimethyl ethanolamine, N-methyl piperidine, and triethanoiamine. For the neutralization of carboxyl groups it is aiso preferred to use ammonia under the conditions set forth in EP-A-0 269 972.<br>
After the addition of water as solvent or dispersing medium, at least the major proportion of the auxiliary solvent used is optionally removed by distillation. The water is used in a quantity which is sufficient to provide a product with a solids content of 10 to 60% by weight, preferably 20 to 45% by weight.<br>
The polyurethane polyureas may also be prepared by other methods known in the art, for example by using hydrazine or diamines as chain extenders c) in a blocked form, i.e. in the form of the corresponding azines or ketimines, as disclosed in U.S. 4,269,748 and 4,829,122.<br>
Altematively, the so-called prepolymer mixing process may be used (see D. Dieterich, Angew. Makromol. Chem. 9A, 142 (1981)). In this process, an NCO prepolymer is initially prepared as described above and after the at least partial conversion of any potentially ionic groups present into ionic groups, the prepolymer is mixed with water to form an emulsion. The NCO groups of the prepolymer are then brought to reaction in the aqueous phase by the addition of amine-functional chain extenders or cross-linking agents c) and/or by a reaction with water.<br>
One example of such a polyurethane polyurea dispersion is Bayhydrol VPLS 2952 ex Bayer.<br>
Mixtures of polyurethanes may be used in (II).<br>
The coating composition of the present invention, being an aqueous coating composition, consists essentially of water. However, about 20 wt.% of liquid content of the coating composition may be an organic solvent. As suitable organic solvents may be mentioned such ether group-containing alcohols as<br><br>
hexyiglycQl, butoxyethanol, 1 -methQxy-propanol-2, 1 -ethoxy-propanQl-2, 1 -pn3poxy-propanol-2, 1 "butoxy-propanol-2, and 1 -isobutoxy-propanol-2; aicohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, and hexanol; diols, such as ethylene glycol and diethyiene giycol.<br>
The coating composition according to the present invention may be cured by physical drying. Altemativeiy, however, the coating compositions may be cured in the presence of a curing agent which reacts with hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups.<br>
Examples of suitable curing agents include N-methylol and/or N-methyioi ether groups-containing aminoplasts obtained by reacting an aldehyde, for instance fomnaldehyde, with an amino or amido groups-containing compound such as melamine, such as Cymel 328, ex Cytec, urea, N.N"-ethylene urea, dicyanodiamide, and benzoguanamine. The resulting compounds are preferably wholly or partially etherified with alcohols having 1-6 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanoi, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, amyl alcohol, hexanol, or mixtures thereof. Especially favourable results may be obtained when using a methyloi melamine having 4-6 methyl groups per molecule of melamine, at least 3 methyloi groups being etherified with butanol or a butanol etherified condensation product of formaldehyde and N,N"-ethylene diurea. Examples of other suitable curing agents include polyisocyanates or water-dispersible blocked polyisocyanate such as a methylethyl ketoxime-blocked, isocyanate group-containing adduct of a polyisocyanate to a hydroxycarboxyltc acid, e.g., dimethylot propionic acid, and aliphatic or aromatic carbodiimides.<br>
In addition to the alkali-swellable core-shell addition polymer (I) and the polyurethane (II), the binder composition may also comprise water-dilutable materials such as alkyd resins, polyesters, polyacrylates, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In addition, the coating composition may contain the conventional additives and adjuvants, such as dispersing agents, dyes, accelerators for the curing reaction and Theology modifiers such as Acrysol RM 2020, Acrysol ASE 60, Coatex Rheo 3000, and Viscalex HV 30.<br>
Applicable pigments may have an acid, a neutral or a basic character. Optionally, the pigments may be pre-treated to modify the properties. Examples of suitable pigments include metallic pigments such as aluminium and stainless steel; nacreous pigments, such as mica coated with a metal oxide such as Iron oxide and/or titanium dioxide; inorganic pigments, such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carbon blacl
The solids content of the coating composition ranges from 5-60 wt.%, preferably from 10-40 wt.%. This depends on whether a metallic pigment Is used or not. The presence of metallic pigments results in a lower solids content compared to when non-metallic pigments are present. However, compared to conventional aqueous base coat systems, the solids content of the coating composition of the present invention is higher in both cases.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition according to the present invention is used as a base coat in a so-called base coat/clear coat system to provide a high gloss metallic appearance. To this end the coating composition according to the Invention comprises so-called "non-leafing" aluminium paste or some other metallic pigment. Use of the coating compositions according to the invention as a base coat may prevent the base coat from being softened by the clear coat after being sprayed with it, so that the metallic effect will not be lost.<br>
The clear coat used in the base coat/clear coat system may for instance be a clear baking lacquer of a conventional polyacrylate/melamine composition. The clear   coat   may   also   be   a   two-component   polyester   or   polyacrylate/<br><br>
polyisocyanate composition. The polyisocyanate may be for example the trimer of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate. The clear coat may also be water borne comprising hydrophilic polyisocyanates.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention may be applied to a substrate in any desirable manner, such as by roller coating, spraying, brushing, sprinkling, flow coating, dipping, electrostatic spraying, or electrophoresis, preferably by spraying.<br>
Suitable substrates may be made of wood, metal, and synthetic material, optionally pretreated, e.g. with a primer or filler. Curing may be carried out at ambient temperature or, optionally, at elevated temperature to reduce the curing time. Optionally, the coating composition may be baked at higher temperatures in the range of, for instance, 60 to 160""C, in a baking oven over a period of 10 to 60 minutes. The clear coat may be applied wet-on-wet on the base coat. Optionally, the base coat may be partially cured prior to the application of the clear coat. Also, the base coat may be fully cured prior to the application of the clear coat.<br>
The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes. The compositions of the present invention may also be used in the first finishing of automobiles.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following examples, which must not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The test methods used in the examples are described below.<br>
The spray viscosity was determined with a DIN cup no. 4. The   solids  content,   the   binder content,   and  the  VOC  were   calculated theoretically. In the calculation of VOC the presence of water is disregarded. The drying time was determined visually. This time started at the moment of spraying the substrate until hiding and ended at the moment the appearance of the coating was opaque.<br>
The following compounds were used:<br>
PAD = Setalux 6801 AQ-24, ex Akzo Nobel Resins<br>
PUR = Bayhydrol VPLS 2952, ex Bayer<br>
Examples 1-9<br>
Several colour formulae were prepared to test the coating compositions of the present invention. To this end, binders, pigments, solvents, water, and conventional additives were mixed together. The selected colour formulae are<br>
given in Table 1.<br>
Metal panels were prepared with a conventional primer. A black and white sticker was applied to the primed panel to be able to establish the hiding properties of the coating composition. Base coat compositions of the colour formulae provided in Table 1 were sprayed on the panels. The panels were cured at ambient temperature.<br>
As can be seen from the results in Table 2, the coating compositions of the present Invention dry noticeably quickly, leading to fast application and taping times. Furthermore, only small amounts of material are needed to provide complete hiding. Finally, the ready-to-spray viscosity versus VOC is excellent.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 10 to 13 and Comparative Examples A to D<br>
Several coiour formulae were prepared as mentioned in Example 1. As comparative examples the same colour formulae were prepared, except that in the binder composition instead of a mixture of Setalux 6801 AQ 24 and Bayhydrol VPLS 2952, 100% Setalux 6801 AQ 24 was used, in such a way that the pigment binder ratio stayed the same.<br>
Conventional solvents were added to the coating compositions so that each had the same ready-to-spray viscosity and applied as explained in Example 1. The results are reported in Table 3.<br><br>
Ex	Colour code	Solids content (wt. %)	P/B	Number<br>

Id. = idem<br>
As can be seen from the results in Table 3, the ready-to-spray viscosity versus the solids content is excellent. Unexpectedly, the coating compositions of the present invention have a higher solids content with the same ready-to-spray viscosity. Furthermore, the coating compositions of the present invention dry noticeably quicker, leading to fast application and taping times. Finally, only small amounts of material are needed to provide complete hiding.<br><br><br>
