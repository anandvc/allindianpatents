				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a method of operating a fuel cell system,<br>
and more particularly, to a method of operating a fuel cell system to optimize<br>
a start-up operation of the fuel cell system at temperatures which may cause<br>
a freezing of water in the fuel cell system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel cell systems convert a fuel and an oxidant to electricity in a<br>
fuel cell stack. One type of fuel cell system employs a proton exchange<br>
membrane (hereinafter "PEM") to catalytically facilitate reaction of the fuel<br>
(such as hydrogen) and the oxidant (such as oxygen or air) to generate<br>
electricity. The PEM is a solid polymer electrolyte membrane that facilitates<br>
transfer of protons from an anode to a cathode in each individual fuel cell<br>
assembly of the fuel cell system. Electrodes, a catalyst, and the PEM are<br>
assembled to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
[0003] In a typical PEM fuel cell assembly, the MEA is disposed between<br>
gas diffusion media (GDM). The GDM and MEA are disposed between a pair<br>
of electrically conductive plates. If the plates are bipolar plates, the plates<br>
conduct current between adjacent fuel cell assemblies in the fuel cell system.<br>
If the plates are unipolar plates at an end of a stack of fuel cell assemblies,<br>
the plates conduct current externally of the fuel cell assemblies.<br>
[0004] Individual fuel cell assemblies include channels formed therein to<br>
facilitate a flow of the reactants and a cooling fluid therethrough. Fuel cell<br>
plates are typically designed with serpentine flow channels. Serpentine flow<br>
channels are desirable as they effectively distribute reactants over an active<br>
area of the fuel cell assembly, thereby maximizing performance and stability<br>
of the fuel cell assembly. Movement of water from the flow channels to outlet<br>
manifolds of the fuel cell plates is caused by the flow of the reactants through<br>
the fuel cell assembly. Water in PEM fuel cell systems may accumulate and<br>
form ice in subfreezing conditions. Repeated freezing and thawing of the PEM<br><br>
may reduce a useful life of the PEM. Additionally, a time required for a start-<br>
up operation of the fuel cell system is increased due to the presence of water<br>
and ice in the fuel cell system. A warm-up and drive away time of a vehicle<br>
including the fuel cell system is also increased.<br>
[0005] Typically, a draining operation is used to remove the water in the<br>
manifolds of the fuel cell system during a shutdown operation. Water that<br>
remains in the fuel cell system after the draining operation may be removed<br>
from the fuel cell system with a shutdown purge. The shutdown purge may be<br>
a vacuum evaporation, an air purge, a cessation of the humidification of the<br>
reactants, or other similar fuel cell assembly humidity starvation methods<br>
known in the art.<br>
[0006] To maintain high proton conductance and low internal resistance in<br>
the fuel cell system during a startup operation and normal operation, the PEM<br>
must maintain a desired level of hydration. Conventional shutdown purge<br>
procedures are typically intended to remove liquid from the flow channels of<br>
the fuel cell plates, GDM, electrode pores, and the PEM of the fuel cell<br>
system. Adequate removal of liquid water (from flow channels for example)<br>
often requires long purge durations, such that the process of moisture<br>
removal from the PEM results in an undesirable drying out of the PEM to a<br>
level below the desired level of hydration. A typical PEM will have a hydration<br>
index (A) of approximately nine. The hydration index is defined as the number<br>
of moles of water per equivalent sulfonic acid group in the PEM. Following<br>
conventional shutdown purge operations, the PEM may have a hydration<br>
index below 3.5. If the hydration index of the PEM is less than nine, an Ohmic<br>
(voltage) loss in the fuel cell assembly will occur. Ohmic loss is defined as a<br>
voltage drop created by resistance to a flow of ions in the PEM and resistance<br>
to a flow of electrons through the electrode and the bipolar plate materials.<br>
During start-up operations in cold or freezing conditions, a hydration index<br>
less than nine may result in an increased Ohmic (voltage) loss in the fuel cell<br>
system, thereby further increasing the warm-up and drive away times.<br><br>
[0007] It would be desirable to develop a method of operating a fuel cell<br>
system to optimize a start-up operation of the fuel cell system at temperatures<br>
which may cause a freezing of water in the fuel cell system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] Concordant and consistent with the present invention, a method of<br>
operating a fuel cell system to optimize a start-up operation of the fuel cell<br>
system at temperatures which may cause a freezing of water in the fuel cell<br>
system, has surprisingly been discovered.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, the method of operating a fuel cell system<br>
comprises the steps of providing a fuel cell stack including a plurality of fuel<br>
cell assemblies, each fuel cell assembly having a proton exchange membrane<br>
disposed between a plurality of fuel cell plates; purging water from the fuel cell<br>
system during a shutdown operation; and operating the fuel cell system<br>
following the shutdown purge to produce product water, wherein the product<br>
water hydrates the proton exchange membrane to militate against an Ohmic<br>
loss across the fuel cell assemblies during a start-up operation of the fuel cell<br>
system.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, the method of operating a fuel cell system<br>
comprises the steps of providing a fuel cell stack including a plurality of fuel<br>
cell assemblies, each fuel cell assembly having a proton exchange membrane<br>
disposed between a plurality of fuel cell plates; purging water from the fuel cell<br>
system during a shutdown operation; producing a current in the fuel cell<br>
system with a current operation following the shutdown purge to produce<br>
product water therein, wherein the water produced hydrates the proton<br>
exchange membrane to militate against an Ohmic loss across the fuel cell<br>
assemblies during a start-up operation of the fuel cell system; and providing a<br>
means for regulating the current flow, wherein the current is regulated in<br>
response to a High Frequency Response (HFR) signal.<br>
[0011] In another embodiment, the method of operating a fuel cell system<br>
comprises the steps of providing a fuel cell stack including a plurality of fuel<br>
cell assemblies, each fuel cell assembly having a proton exchange membrane<br>
disposed between a plurality of fuel cell plates; purging water from the fuel cell<br><br>
system during a shutdown operation; producing a current in the fuel cell<br>
system with a current operation following the shutdown purge to produce<br>
product water therein, wherein the water produced hydrates the proton<br>
exchange membrane to militate against an Ohmic loss across the fuel cell<br>
assemblies during a start-up operation of the fuel cell system; and providing a<br>
means for regulating the current, wherein the current is produced for a desired<br>
duration to produce a desired amount of product water to achieve a desired<br>
hydration index (A) of the proton exchange membrane.<br>

[0012] The above, as well as other advantages of the present invention,<br>
will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following<br>

two fuel cell assemblies according to prior art; and<br>
[0014] Fig. 2 is a fragmentary cross-sectional view of a fuel cell assembly.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] The following detailed description and appended drawings describe<br>
and illustrate various exemplary embodiments of the invention. The<br>
description and drawings serve to enable one skilled in the art to make and<br>
use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in<br>
any manner. In respect of the methods disclosed, the steps presented are<br>
exemplary in nature, and thus, the order of the steps is not necessary or<br>
critical.<br>
[0016] Fig. 1 illustrates a fuel cell system 10 including two fuel cells<br>
according to prior art. However, it is understood that any number of fuel cells<br>
may be used in the fuel cell system 10, as desired. The fuel cell system 10<br>
includes a pair of membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs) 12, 14 separated<br>
by a bipolar plate 16. The MEAs 12, 14 and bipolar plate 16 are stacked<br>
together between end plates 18, 20, and end contact elements 22, 24. The<br><br>
bipolar plate 16 and the end contact elements 22, 24 include working faces<br>
26, 28, 30, 32, respectively, for distributing a fuel and an oxidant (e.g., H2 and<br>
O2, respectively) to the MEAs 12, 14. Nonconductive gaskets 34 provide<br>
seals and electrical insulation between the several components of the fuel cell<br>
system 10.<br>
[0017] The MEAs 12, 14 are disposed adjacent gas permeable conductive<br>
materials known as gas diffusion media (not shown). The gas diffusion media<br>
may include carbon or graphite diffusion paper. As described herein, the gas<br>
diffusion media are adhered to the MEAs 12, 14. The end contact elements<br>
22, 24 are disposed adjacent the diffusion media of the MEAs 12, 14. The<br>
bipolar plate 16 is disposed adjacent the diffusion media on an anode face of<br>
the MEA 12, and is also disposed adjacent the gas diffusion media on a<br>
cathode face of the MEA 14. Oxygen is supplied to the cathode side 36 of the<br>
fuel cell system 10 from an oxygen source 38, for example, via an appropriate<br>
supply conduit 40. Hydrogen is supplied to the anode side 42 of the fuel cell<br>
from a hydrogen source 44, for example, via an appropriate supply conduit<br>
46. Alternatively, ambient air may be supplied to the cathode side as an<br>
oxygen source and hydrogen to the anode from a methanol or gasoline<br>
reformer, and the like. Exhaust conduits (not shown) for both the anode side<br>
42 and the cathode side 36 of the MEAs 12, 14 are also provided. Additional<br>
conduits 48, 50, 52 are provided for supplying liquid coolant to the bipolar<br>
plate 16 and the end plates 18, 20. Appropriate conduits for exhausting<br>
coolant from the bipolar plate 16 and end plates 18, 20 are also provided (not<br>
shown).<br>
[0018] Referring next to Fig. 2, a PEM fuel cell assembly 54 is illustrated.<br>
The fuel cell assembly 54 includes a first bipolar plate 56, a second bipolar<br>
plate 58, and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 12. The MEA 12 is<br>
disposed between diffusion media 60.<br>
[0019] The MEA 12 includes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 62<br>
disposed between two catalyst layers 64. The PEM 62 is a thin, solid polymer<br>
membrane-electrolyte, but may be any conventional PEM 62, as desired. The<br>
catalyst layers 64 are formed from platinum supported on high-structure<br><br>
carbon in the illustrated embodiment, but may be any conventional catalyst<br>
such as a platinum-ruthenium catalyst, for example. It is understood that the<br>
MEA 12 may include a microporous layer (not shown) for increased current<br>
density and water management in the fuel cell assembly 54.<br>
[0020] The diffusion media 60 include a first side 66 and a second side 68.<br>
One of the diffusion media 60 is disposed between the MEA 12 and the first<br>
bipolar plate 56, and the other of the diffusion media 60 is disposed between<br>
the MEA 12 and the second bipolar plate 58.<br>
[0021] In use, hydrogen is supplied to the end contact element 24 and the<br>
anode side 42 of the bipolar plate 16 of the fuel cell system 10 from the<br>
hydrogen source 44 through the conduit 46. Oxygen is supplied as the oxidant<br>
to the end contact element 22 and the cathode side 36 of the bipolar plate 16<br>
from the oxygen source 38 through the conduit 40. Alternatively, ambient air<br>
may be supplied to the cathode side 36 as an oxidant and hydrogen may be<br>
supplied to the anode side 42 from a methanol or gasoline reformer. At the<br>
anode side 42, the hydrogen is catalytically split into protons and electrons.<br>
The protons formed permeate through the PEM 62 to the cathode side 36.<br>
The electrons travel along an external load circuit (not shown) to the cathode<br>
side 36 of the MEA 12, thus creating a current output of the fuel cell system<br>
10. Simultaneously, the stream of oxygen is delivered to the cathode side 36<br>
of the MEA 12. At the cathode side 36, oxygen molecules react with the<br>
protons permeating through the PEM 62, and the electrons arriving through<br>
the external circuit to form product water. The water is susceptible to freezing<br>
when exposed to temperatures below the freezing point thereof.<br>
[0022] During a shutdown operation of the fuel cell system 10, a purge<br>
operation may be performed to remove channel water, water slugs, and<br>
residual water from the MEA 12, and to militate against the formation of ice in<br>
subfreezing conditions. When the MEA 12 is dried, the PEM 62 is also dried.<br>
The PEM may reach a hydration index (A) substantially near 3.5, where the<br>
hydration index is defined as the number of moles of water per equivalent<br>
sulfonic acid group (SO3-) in the PEM. When the ambient temperature is -20<br>
degrees Celsius and the hydration index is at or above 9, the PEM 62 is<br><br>
considered sufficiently hydrated. It is understood that at ambient<br>
temperatures below -20 degrees Celsius, sufficient hydration of the PEM 62 is<br>
indicated by a lower hydration index (i.e. A is at or above 6) and at ambient<br>
temperatures above -20 degress Celsius, sufficient hydration of the PEM 62 is<br>
indicated by a higher hydration index (i.e. A is at or above 10). Insufficient<br>
hydration exists when the hydration index is below nine for the PEM 62.<br>
When the PEM 62 is dried to a hydration index substantially below 9,<br>
undesirable Ohmic (voltage) losses may occur. The Ohmic losses may<br>
increase during a startup operation at temperatures near or below the freezing<br>
point of water.<br>
[0023] To counteract the insufficient hydration and militate against the<br>
Ohmic loss, a current is produced in the fuel cell system 10 following the<br>
purge operation. The current is produced by briefly operating the fuel cell<br>
system 10. This brief operation is known as a current operation. The current<br>
operation is performed to generate a desired amount of product water in the<br>
fuel cell system 10 to hydrate the PEM 62. Hydrating the PEM 62 after the<br>
purge operation militates against Ohmic losses during the start-up operation.<br>
The desired amount of product water is an amount sufficient to hydrate the<br>
PEM 62 to a desired hydration index, without producing product water to a<br>
point where the water is overflowing into the catalyst layers 64. Favorable<br>
results have been obtained where the current produced in the fuel cell system<br>
10 has a current density at or below 0.12 A/cm2, although other current<br>
densities can be used as desired. For example, where a current density of<br>
0.02 A/cm2 requires a duration of 230 seconds to sufficiently hydrate the PEM<br>
62, a current density of 0.05 A/cm2 requires a duration of 92 seconds to<br>
sufficiently hydrate the PEM 62 in similar conditions. Where the current<br>
density is low, the duration of the current operation is longer to re-hydrate the<br>
PEM 62. However, if the current density is too high, the PEM will not absorb<br>
the product water as fast as the water is being created and the water will<br>
overflow into the catalyst layer, undoing the benefits accomplished by the<br>
purge. The current density of the current operation should not be greater than<br>
a rate at which the PEM can absorb the product water.. The rate at which the<br><br>
PEM can absorb water is dependant upon characteristics of the PEM, such<br>
as, equivalent weight (EW), catalyst loading, and electrode composition, for<br>
example. A particular combination of PEM characteristics is evaluated and<br>
the current density is adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0024] A duration of the current operation may be regulated to produce the<br>
desired amount of product water, wherein regulation of the current may<br>
include an increase in magnitude, a decrease in magnitude, a constant<br>
magnitude, and a stopping of current flow. The duration may be<br>
predetermined, or the duration may be regulated in response to a High<br>
Frequency Response (HFR) signal, for example. As shown in Fig. 2, a<br>
frequency response system 70 is adapted to measure the HFR of the fuel cell<br>
assembly 54. The frequency response system of the disclosure may be any<br>
known device suitable for measuring HFR of fuel cell systems or fuel cell<br>
components such as a frequency response analyzer, for example. HFR<br>
consists of measuring the changes in electrical impedance of the fuel cell<br>
system 10 as an AC signal is applied to the electronic load to modulate a DC<br>
load current. The AC signal is typically generated at a particular frequency on<br>
the order of 1kHz. However, it is understood that the AC signal may be varied<br>
over a range of frequencies. The resulting magnitude and phase of the AC<br>
voltage and current response are measured by the frequency response<br>
system 70. The amplitude and phase relationship between this set of signals<br>
will yield a wide variety of analytical results such as overall impedance<br>
magnitude, for example.<br>
[0025] The frequency response system 70 is adapted to measure the HFR<br>
across at least one of the PEMs 62 of the fuel cell system 10. As a<br>
nonlimiting example, the frequency response system 70 is in independent<br>
electrical communication with one or more of the fuel cell assemblies 54 of the<br>
fuel cell system 10. The frequency response system 70 is adapted to<br>
measure the HFR across at least a portion of the entire fuel cell system 10.<br>
As illustrated, the frequency response system 70 is shown in electrical<br>
communication with the catalyst layers 64. A skilled artisan should appreciate<br><br>
that other configurations of the frequency response system 70 for measuring<br>
the HFR of the fuel cell system 10 may be selected as desired.<br>
[0026] Where the duration of the current produced during the current<br>
operation is predetermined, the current will be generated for the duration of<br>
the current operation to hydrate the PEM 62 to the desired hydration index.<br>
For example, if the hydration index of the PEM 62 is 3.5 and the current<br>
density during the current operation is 0.02 A/cm2 lasting 230 seconds, the<br>
PEM 62 hydrate the PEM 62 for 230 seconds before the current operation<br>
stops. It is understood that the duration of the current may be regulated by<br>
any conventional means such as a manually operation and a controller, for<br>
example.<br>
[0027] Where the duration of the current is regulated in response to a High<br>
Frequency Response (HFR) signal, changes in electrical impedance of the<br>
fuel cell system 10 are measured as an AC signal is applied to the electronic<br>
load to modulate a DC load current. The HFR signal is measured by the<br>
frequency response system 70 and analyzed by an operator. As the<br>
hydration of the PEM 62 increases, the HFR value decrease. The duration of<br>
the current during the current operation is continued until a desired change in<br>
HFR value is reached, indicating that the PEM 62 has reached a hydration<br>
index substantially near 9 or the desired hydration. It is understood that the<br>
frequency response system 70 may include a controller adapted to regulate<br>
the current in response to the HFR signal. By hydrating the PEM 62 to a<br>
hydration index substantially near 9, Ohmic losses in the fuel cell system 10<br>
encountered during a start-up operation, especially in cold or freezing<br>
conditions, are minimized. Accordingly, power generation is maximized and a<br>
warm up time, and a time to reaching drive-away power are minimized.<br>
[0028] From the foregoing description, one ordinarily skilled in the art can<br>
easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention and, without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and<br>
modifications to the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.<br><br>
