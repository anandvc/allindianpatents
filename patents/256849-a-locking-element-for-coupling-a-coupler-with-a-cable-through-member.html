				<td>Coupler for Cable Trough<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system for the management and routing of telecommunication cables, and, more particularly, to a coupler for joining two or more trough members.<br>
Background<br>
In the telecommunications industry, the use of optical fibers for signal transmissions is accelerating. With the increased utilization of optical fiber systems, optical fiber cable management requires industry attention.<br>
One area of optical fiber management that is necessary is the routing of optical fibers from one piece of equipment to another. For example, in a telecommunications facility, optical fiber cables may be routed between fiber distribution equipment and optical line terminating equipment. In buildings and other structures that carry such equipment, the cable routing can take place in concealed ceiling areas or in any other manner to route cables from one location to another.<br>
When routing optical fibers and other cables such as copper wires, it is desirable that a routing system will be readily modifiable and adaptable to changes in equipment needs. Accordingly, such routing systems include a plurality of components, such as trough members and couplers, for defining the cable routing paths. The trough members are joined together by couplings. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,067,678, 5,316,243, and 5,752,781 teach cable routing systems that include a plurality of trough members and couplers.<br>
Various concerns arise in the use of couplers for coupling trough members. One concern is that a plurality of hardware is used for joining the trough members. This hardware can be cumbersome. Further, there is sometimes a need to rearrange or change the trough members and couplers. It is desirable to provide couplers that can be disconnected.<br>
Summary<br>
A coupler for a cable trough system according to one aspect of the invention may include a body including a bottom wall and two side walls defining a<br>
trough, the body having a body terminal end defining an overlap region, the overlap region being sized to slideably receive a terminal end of a trough member along a longitudinal direction of the body, and a spring coupled to the body and positioned in the overlap region for securing the terminal end of the trough member to the coupler, the spring including first and second spring arms extending generally in opposition to one another in a plane generally parallel to the longitudinal direction.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
As used herein, the terms "couple" and "coupled" mean to join or attach one element in relation to a second element, whether the attachment is made directly with the second element or indirectly through intermediate components. As used herein, the term "slot" means a space defined by one or more surfaces and may include, without limitation, T-slots, closed slots, flanges, and projections.<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a trough system 10 that is an embodiment of the present invention. The system 10 includes a coupler 100 for interconnecting trough members 300A and 300B. The coupler 100 includes a locking mechanism having at least one locking element. In the embodiment shown, four locking elements 107A, 107B, 107C, and 107D are providing secure connection between the coupler 100 and a trough member, such as trough member 300A. The coupler 100 may also provide secure connections with one or more additional trough members, such as trough member 300B. In addition, the coupler may be configured to release the connections between the coupler 100 and the trough members 300A and 300B. In an example embodiment, the locking mechanism is tool-less (i.e., the locking mechanism does not require the use of a separate tool). However, locking<br>
mechanisms required to be engaged by an auxiliary tool are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
I.	Coupler<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2-6, the coupler 100 includes a first guiding surface 101 and a second guiding surface 102 at least partially surrounding the first guiding surface 101, as well as a first coupler end 110 and a second coupler end 111 A spacing 103 is defined between the first guiding surface 101 and the second guiding surface 102. The spacing 103 is sized to receive a trough member (see, e.g., trough member 300 of FIGS. 12-14) or other trough system component inserted into the spacing 103 in a longitudinal direction 190.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the first guiding surface 101 of the coupler 100 is generally in the shape of a trough, including a first side wall portion 104 and a second side wall portion 105, as well as a bottom wall portion 106 joining the first and second side wall portions 104 and 105. As used herein, the term "trough" mean; any structure that defines an interior in which an element such as an optical cable can be maintained. The second guiding surface 102 is also in the shape of a trough. A midpoint or midsection 175 divides the coupler 100 into first and second halves 176 and 177, and generally surrounds at least a portion of the first guiding surface 101.<br>
As indicated above, the locking mechanism of the coupler is used to secure trough members to the ends 110 and 111 of the coupler 100. The locking elements 107 A, 107B, 107C, and 107D of the locking mechanism are coupled to an exterior of the coupler 100, using, for example, a clip 208 as shown in FIGS. 7-10 and described below.<br>
Although the first locking element 107A is described in detail below, the second, third, and fourth locking elements 107B, 107C, and 107D have an identical structure and function similarly in the illustrated embodiment.<br>
The locking element 107A is shown in isolation in FIGS. 7-12. The locking element 107A includes a main body 200, springs 210A and 210B, and spring releases 220A and 220B. The main body 200 includes a first portion 202 and a second portion 204 coupled by a bridge 203. The main body further includes railways 205A and 205B, T-shaped detents 207A and 207B, and the clip 208.<br>
The spring 210A, shown in exploded form in FIG. 8, includes first and second arms 211 and 212 coupled by a bridge 213. The first and second arms 211 and 212 are positioned to extend generally at an angle in opposition to one another. As used herein, to extend "generally in opposition" means to extend at diverging angles with respect to one another. In addition, the first and second arms are aligned generally in a plane. The spring 210A may be coupled to the coupler 100 by press-fitting the spring 210A into a slot 251 defined on the main body 200. The spring 21 OB is similarly configured. Preferably, springs 210A and 21 OB are one-piece, V-shaped leaf springs made of metal.<br>
Although the example springs 210A and 21 OB are shown, other spring configurations may also be used. For example, a spring including a single arm, or arms extending at different angles to those shown, may also be used.<br>
The spring release 220A includes a sliding portion 222A and a finger portion 223A with fingers 224 and 226. The sliding portion 222A defines an aperture 260 that is configured to slidingly engage and ride along the railway 205A between a locked position and an unlocked position. The spring release 220A is maintained on the railway 205 A by the detent 207A that engages an edge 227 of the finger portion 223 A as the spring release 220A is slid longitudinally in a direction away from the bridge 203 (i.e., the locked position).<br>
The fingers 224 and 226 of the finger portion 223 A are positioned to engage the spring arms 211 and 212 as the spring release 220A is slid longitudinally in a direction towards the bridge 203 from the locked position to the unlocked position. In the locked position, as shown, for example, in FIGS. 7 and 9, the fingers 224 and 226 of the spring release 220A release the spring arms 211 and 212 of the spring 210A. As the spring release 220A is slid towards the bridge 203 and the unlocked position, the fingers 224 and 226 push the spring arms 211 and 212 towards one another.<br>
In a fully engaged or the unlocked position, as shown by the spring release 220B, the fingers 224 and 226 of the spring release 220B fully engage the spring arms 211 and 212 of the spring 210B. It is therefore possible for one spring release of the locking element 107 A to be in the locked position, while the other spring release is in the unlocked position. For example, in FIG. 7, the spring release<br>
220A is in the unlocked position, while the spring release 220B is in the locked position.<br>
With no external force being applied, the spring release 220A is forced by the spring 210A into the locked position. However, the spring release, as is shown by the spring release 220B in FIGS. 7 and 12, may be maintained in the unlocked position by the detent 207B that engages an edge 228 of the sliding portion 222B of the spring release 220B when the spring release is placed in the fully unlocked position. The spring release 220A is similarly configured.<br>
Other configurations for the spring release, and specifically, the fingers, are also possible. For example, the fingers may be positioned to engage a portion of the spring arms closer to the bridge of the spring, thereby allowing for greater movement of the spring arms by the fingers. In addition, the spring release may optionally be removed from the locking element.<br>
As noted above, the locking element 107A is coupled to the coupler 100 using the clip 208 extending from the bridge 203 of the locking element 107 A, as is shown in FIGS. 7-10 and 12. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, the clip 208 is sized to extend through an interior portion defined by walls 108 on the coupler 100, and detents 209 on the end of the clip 208 engage an edge of the walls 108 facing the coupler, thereby coupling the locking element 107A to the coupler 100. This configuration for attaching the locking element to the coupler may be advantageous, for example, because the locking element can be snap-fit onto the coupler at the desired time. In addition, it is possible to replace a locking element, if needed.<br>
II.       Trough<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 13-15, an example embodiment of a trough member 300 is shown according to the present invention. As used herein, the term trough member is used to refer to any trough, fitting, railway, raceway, or similarly configured component including any number of ends. Although a specific embodiment of a trough member is shown in and described with respect to FIGS. 13-15, any other trough member may also be used.<br>
The trough member 300 includes a first terminal end 302 and a second terminal end 303. The trough member 300 is generally in the shape of a trough including first and second side walls 305 and 306 coupled by a bottom wall<br>
307, thereby defining an interior surface 308 and an exterior surface 309. Walls 305, 306 and 307 are each generally planar. The exterior surface 309 define one or more slots 310 on the side walls 305 and 306 and bottom wall 307. The slots 310 extend in a longitudinal direction 301 of the trough member 300 from the first terminal end 302 to the second terminal end 303. Typically, slots will be provided for at least one, and preferably each, locking element, as described further below. Alternative configurations and placement for the slots 310 are also possible. For example, the slots 310 may be T-slots, as shown on the example embodiment of the trough 300. As used herein, the term "T-slot" means a slot having a narrow access opening and a wider interior region. In addition, the slots 310 may also be flanges or opposing projections. For example, the trough member 300B, known to those skilled in the art as a fitting and shown in FIGS. 16-23, includes slots defined by flanges 370 on side walls (see FIG. 19) and slots defined by opposing projections 371 and 372 on the bottom wall (see FIG. 22), rather than T-slots. Other configurations are possible. Preferred slot configurations include at least two opposing surfaces that extend in the longitudinal direction 301, although a single surface may also be used. The slots 310 may not extend fully between the terminal ends of the trough member. The placement of the slots on the exterior surface of the trough members may be altered. More or fewer slots may also be provided.<br>
III.      System<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 16-23, an embodiment of a trough system 400 is shown including the coupler 100 as well as first and second trough members 300A and 300B. As illustrated, the terminal ends of the trough members 300A and 300B may be slidingly engaged in the spacing 103 between the first and second guiding surfaces 101 and 102 of the coupler 100. In other words, the thickness of the walls of each of the trough members 300A and 300B, or the distance between the inner and outer surfaces, are sized to fit within the spacing 103 of the coupler 100. The coupler 100 overlaps the terminal ends of each of the trough members 300A and 300B to form the coupling, the overlap defining an overlap region.<br>
As each trough member is inserted into a respective end of the coupler 100, a portion of each locking element is slidingly received within each<br>
corresponding slot. For example, as shown in FIG. 19, at least part of the first portion 202 of the locking element 107A is partially received within the slot 310 of the trough member 300A. Similarly, at least part of the second portion 204 of the locking element 107A is received in a corresponding slot 310 of trough member 300B.<br>
As shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 23 taken along line 23-23 of FIG. 21, the springs 210A and 210B and finger portions 223A and 223B of locking element 107B are positioned within the slot 310 of the trough members 300A and 300B. With a finger portion, such as finger portion 223B, in the locked position, the spring arms 211 and 212 of the spring 210B resiliently engage opposing portions 315 and 316 of the slot 310, thereby maintaining the locking element 107B within the slot 310 and coupling the coupler 100 to the trough member 300B.<br>
The opposing portions 315 and 316 each extend generally parallel to the longitudinal direction 190 of the coupler 100. Likewise, the forces applied by the spring arms 211 and 212 are generally exerted in opposite directions aligned in a plane extending generally parallel to the longitudinal direction 190 of the coupler 100 along one of the walls of the trough.<br>
In contrast, with a finger portion, such as finger portion 223A, in the unlocked position, the fingers 224 and 226 fully engage spring arms 211 and 212 of the spring 210A, pushing the arms towards each other and away from the portions 315 and 316 so that the trough member 300A can be slid in the longitudinal direction 190 out of the coupler 100, thereby uncoupling the trough member 300A from the coupler 100.<br>
The other locking elements 107A, 107C, and 107D function in a manner similar to that of the locking element 107B illustrated.<br>
IV.      Method of Use<br>
An example method for coupling one or more trough members to the coupler 100 in accordance with the present invention is as follows. The locking elements 107A, 107B, 107C, and 107D may be in the unlocked or locked position. The terminal end 302 of the trough member 300A may be inserted into the coupler 100, thereby causing the spring 210A and spring release 220A portions of each<br>
locking element 107A, 107B, 107C, and 107D to be received in the slots 310 of the trough member 300A. The angled shape of the spring arms 211 and 212 of each spring is angled toward the direction of insertion of the terminal end 302 of the trough member 300A to allow the trough member 300A to be inserted with little resistance from the spring.<br>
With the trough member 300A fully inserted into the coupler 100 and the locking elements in the locked position, the spring arms 211 and 212 of each spring push against opposing portions 315 and 316 of each slot 310. Removal of the trough member 300A is resisted by the angled shape of the arms 211 and 212 and ends of the arms grasping or embedding into the opposing portions 315 and 316 of the trough member 300A. The second trough member 300B may be coupled to the second coupler end 111 of the coupler 100 in a similar manner.<br>
An example method of removing the trough member 300A in accordance with the present invention includes sliding the spring release 220A of each locking element to the unlocked position, thereby removing the pushing force of the spring arms 211 and 212 from the opposing portions 315 and 316 of the slots 310. The trough member 300A may then be removed. The second trough member 300B may be removed in a similar fashion.<br>
Alternative embodiments to those provided herein are also possible. For example, it is possible to alter the configuration of the engagement between the locking elements and the slots on the trough members. For example, it may only be necessary to provide a spring with a single spring arm that engages an opposing portion (e.g., a flange) of the trough. In addition, a separate fastener, such as a screw, could also be used in combination with the locking elements.<br>
The coupler 100 and trough members 300, 300A, and 300B are presented herein by way of example only, and other configurations are possible. For example, a coupler may be configured to be coupled to more than two trough members, therefore including more than the first and second coupler ends. Further, a greater number of locking elements and/or springs may be presented for each coupler end, or, alternatively, fewer locking elements and/or springs, for example, one, may be used.<br><br>
IV.      Alternative Locking Element<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 24-40, another example embodiment of a locking element 400 is shown. The locking element 400 is similar to the locking elements 107A-107D described above, with the noted differences.<br>
The locking element 400 generally includes a main body 401, springs 410A and 410B, spring releases 420A and 420B, and a clip 408. The springs 410A and 410B are configured and function in a manner similar to springs 210A and 210B.<br>
The spring releases 420A and 420B include first ramps 505A and 505B (see FIGS. 30, 31, 33, and 34). The spring releases 420A and 420B also include second ramps (not shown) positioned generally opposite to the first ramps 505A and 505B and configured in a similar manner. The main body 401 includes railways 405A and 405B that define notches 510A, 512A and 510B, 512B (see FIGS. 35-40). In the locked position (as shown in FIGS. 27, 30, and 31), the first ramps 505 A and 505B (as well as the second ramps) of the spring releases 420A and 420B are positioned beyond ends 509A and 509B of the railways 405A and 405B.<br>
The railways 405A and 405B also include buttons 520A and 520B positioned to extend through apertures 590A and 590B defined in the spring releases 420A and 420B. The apertures 590A and 590B are sized to allow the spring releases 420A and 420B to slide along the railways 405A and 405B. The spring releases 420A and 420B also include recesses 591 positioned adjacent a portion of the apertures 590A and 590B to allow for greater access to the buttons 520A and 520, as described further below. The railways 420A and 420B also include indicators 592 and 593 to indicate whether each spring release 420A and 420B of the locking element 400 is in the locked or unlocked position. In the example embodiment shown, the indicators 592 and 593 are pictorial (showing a padlock in the locked and unlocked positions). However, other visual indicators, such as alphanumeric wording or colors could also be used.<br>
As the spring releases 420A and 420B are slid towards the unlocked position, the first ramps 505A and 505B (as well as the second ramps) engage the ends 509A and 509B of the railways 405 A and 405B, push the railways 405A and 405B generally in a direction Y (see FIGS. 31 and 40), and generally travel along the railways 405A and 405B.<br>
Once the first ramps 505A and 505B (as well as the second ramps) have traveled over the ends 509A and 509B of the railways 405 A and 405B, the ramps are received in the notches 510A, 512A and 510B, 512B, respectively, and the railways 405A and 405B are allowed to move back in a direction opposite to the direction Y. In this position (as shown in FIGS. 32-34), the ramps are held within the notches, and the spring releases 420A and 420B are retained in the unlocked position.<br>
When it is necessary to move the spring releases 420A and 420B back to the locked position, one or both buttons 520A and 520B disposed on the railways 405A and 405B may be pushed, thereby causing the railways 405A and/or 405B to move generally in the direction Y and the first ramps 505A and 505B (as well as the second ramps) to disengage from the notches 510A, 512A and 51 OB, 512B. In this configuration, the spring releases 420A and 420B are free to move back to the locked position (as shown in FIGS. 27,30, and 31).<br>
Referring now to FIG. 41, the locking element 400 and a coupler 550 are shown positioned adjacent to one another to illustrate how the locking element 400 may be coupled to the coupler 550. Referring now to FIG. 42, the clip 408 of the locking element 400 may be inserted into an aperture 580 defined by shoulders 551 of the coupler 550. As the clip 408 is pushed through the aperture 580, the clip 408 is compressed so that arms 571 of the clip 408 move towards one another. Referring now to FIG. 43, the clip 408 of the locking element 400 is shown fully inserted and coupled to the coupler 550. Detents 409 on the ends of the arms 571 engage the shoulders 551 of the coupler 550 to retain the locking element 400 on the coupler 550.<br>
The locking element 400 also includes an hole 530 defined in the main body 401. As shown in FIG. 44, the hole 530 is configured to receive an attaching element 540. In the example embodiment shown, the attaching element 540 is a screw, although other attaching elements such as bolts, rivets, or other fasteners may be used. An end 545 of the attaching element 540 extends through the hole 530.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 45-47, the locking element 400 is shown coupled to a coupler 550 by the clip 408. In addition, a mounting bracket 560 is coupled to the coupler 550 by the attaching element 540. The mounting bracket 560<br>
may generally be any structure used to hold a trough system in place. For example, as shown in FIG. 46, the mounting bracket 560 may be formed in various shapes to position the coupler 550 as desired. The mounting bracket 560 may, in turn, be coupled to a support structure located above, below, or adjacent to the coupler 550. In the example embodiment shown, the mounting bracket 560 is part of a threaded rod bracket kit including threaded rod 562 and nuts 564. Other configurations are possible.<br>
As illustrated, the attaching element 540 may be used to couple the mounting bracket 560 to the coupler 550. In addition, the end 545 of the attaching element 540 may engage knobs 570 extending from the arms 571 in a direction opposite to detents 409 on the clip 408. The end 545 of the attaching element 540 is positioned so that the arms 571 of the clip 408 are not allowed to move towards one another (as shown in FIG. 42). Therefore, the locking element 400 may be further retained on the coupler 550.<br>
