				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to background luminous for mechanical and/or electrical and/or electronic systems, more specifically related to a light guide (1) of an indicating device for uniform illumination of dial (2) comprises a printed circuit board [PCB (3)] at its center with built-in light emitting diodes [LED (4)].<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
The existing trends of instrument cluster dials are illuminated by incorporating one or more candescent lamp below the dial or by using light conducting transparent material optically coupled to a near-by light source. In the case of the lamp on the dial, it is expensive to provide a lamp that is sufficiently small and yet not sufficiently bright to illuminate the dial, this lamp consumes more current and generate more heat.<br>
The techniques for illuminating dials, indicators and instrument face plates have become increasingly popular over the last decade because they offer opportunities to mask the light source from the viewer or operator and also flexibility in positioning the light source, and if properly utilized, can defuse and spread light evenly over the surface to be illuminated.<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for illuminating a dial display with a light source and light guide with matt-finish surfaces to increase the light efficiency for an instrument dial display. An instrument cluster for a vehicle is located on a vehicle dashboard and includes several gauges or dials that indicate various vehicle-operating conditions. For example, an instrument cluster may include a speedometer, a tachometer, an engine oil temperature indicator, oil pressure indicator etc, and other known types of gauges. These gauges are illuminated to facilitate reading of the information by the vehicle occupants.<br>
Improvements in the area of optics over the years have resulted in a significant increase in light output from light sources. This has significantly increased the number of light sources needed to adequately illuminate an instrument display. However, this increased<br><br>
light output has also made it more difficult to evenly or uniformly distribute luminance over the display without requiring some form of compensation. Compensation usually involves the addition of coatings or layers of material applied to at least one of the gauge components to absorb light in certain areas. In one example, an additional layer of black dots is applied to the dial bottom in the areas of bright illumination, i.e. the areas closest to the light source. This layer of dots is typically placed on top of the white paint layer, which is applied to the bottom surface of the dial. While this configuration provides for more even illumination, it is disadvantage because light efficiency is decreased due to the light absorption.<br>
Thus, there is a need for an instrument gauge and/or dial display that provides a more even/uniform and brighter illumination in order to overcome the other above-mentioned problems.<br>
One way to improve the illumination on the dial of an instrument cluster is by providing light emitting diodes rather the use of any sort of lamps. For example, US Patent Number 6, 979, 094 describes the use of light emitting diodes, wherein reflector provides different-colored backlighting to indicia and a background field of an instrument dial. The dial is mounted on a reflector, forming an interior space. The reflector is assembled on a printed circuit board (PCB). A recessed section of the reflector has an opening exposing a portion of the PCB) to the interior space. Another section of the reflector provides a short tube having an inner cavity suspended over the opening. A first group of light emitting diodes is mounted on the exposed portion of the PCB under the tube such that light from the first group is reflected through the inner cavity to light a pointer. A second group of light emitting diodes having a different color is mounted outside the tube and backlights the indicia of the dial. A gap between the exposed portion of the PCB and an end of the tube enables light to leak from the inner cavity and backlight the background field of the dial a different color than the indicia.<br>
However the above document discloses the illumination of the instrument cluster with PCB, the document US 6, 979, 094 is no where related to instant invention. In case of instant invention the dial is uniformly illuminated with the use of miniature light emitting<br><br>
diodes and the light guide. The light guide in instant invention is a solid section for uniform illumination of the dial, whereas in the prior art there is an interior space provided for reflection of light beams emitted from a light source. This interior space will raise a problem of spot light brightness of the dial and occupies more space within the system of instrument cluster.<br>
Thus in the instant invention the use of light guide made as transparent solid section to get uniform illumination for the background of dial makes the entire system simple in construction, robust in design and economical. In addition the instant invention overcomes the spot light section illumination on the dial.<br>
Yet another existing way for providing automobile instrument cluster illuminated is by providing light sources producing different colours of light. For example US 5, 975, 728 provides for an automobile instrument cluster being illuminated by different colours of light. It provides for a method and apparatus for providing user selectable multi-color illumination to automotive instrument panel instruments. In one embodiment, an instrument panel or individual instrument is supplied with a plurality of differently colored illumination sources. The intensity of each color is individually controllable, allowing the user to select both intensity and hue of instrument illumination. In one embodiment, an instrument panel illumination system comprises three light sources that produce nominally white light and three associated diffusing filters, one red, one green, one blue. In other embodiment different colors of illumination are provided by light sources producing different colors of light, such as, for example, a plurality of high intensity red, green, and blue light emitting diodes ("LED's"). In one embodiment, a plurality of triplets of red, green and blue high intensity LED's are mounted above a white diffusing filter. In one embodiment, a plurality of colored light sources is mounted in instrument housing behind the instrument's bezel.<br>
However the above US 5, 975, 728 document discloses the use of LED's with specific in their colours. There are number of sets of LED's with red, green, and blue colours with a white diffusing filter. Thus the US document is no where related to instant invention whereas in the instant invention the dial is uniformly illuminated with the use of<br><br>
miniature light emitting diodes and the light guide. The light guide in instant invention is a solid section for uniform illumination on the dial, whereas in the prior art there is an interior space provided for reflection of light beams emitted from a light source. This interior space will raise a problem of spot light brightness of the dial and occupies more space within the system of instrument cluster. Thus the problem of spot light illumination on the dial of an instrument cluster is completely solved by the instant invention.<br>

These light beams will hit the angular bottom surface of the light guide (1). The surfaces<br>
of the light guides (1) are given with the fine matt finish which will increase the<br>
reflecting property of the light guide (1) and hence reduces the loss of light beams from<br>
the light guide (1). The reflected light beams will hit the dial (2) background for uniform<br>
illumination.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the reflection of the emitted light beams inside the light guide (1) for uniform illumination. The dial (2) is uniformly illuminated by the emitted light from the LEDs (4). These LEDs (4) is miniature in size and are able to emit multi-color. The light beams emitted from the LEDs (4) enter the light for reflection in a direction wherein the beams should hit the angular bottom surface of the light guide (1). These light beams will reflect back through the fine matt finished surface and increases the light beam intensity<br><br>
within the light guide (1). Hence the dial (2) background is illuminated uniformly using the light guide (1) which is a solid section in nature.<br>
Solid-section<br>
