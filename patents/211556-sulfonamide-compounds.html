wherein A represents a ketaiized 1,2-dihydroxy-ethylene group,<br>
and, if desired, modifying substituents present in the resulting compound of formula I and/or converting the compound of formula I obtained into a salt.<br>
In the reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of the formula H0(CR2Rb)nXH, this is conveniently used as the alkali metal alcoholate.   The corresponding glycol or the corresponding aminoalcohol, thus e.g. ethylene glycol or aminoethanol, when n = 2, is preferably used as the solvent.   The alkali metal alcoholate is preferably sodium alcoholate.   The reaction is conveniently carried out while heating, e.g. to 40-120Â°C.  In a preferred embodiment the compound H0(CR2Rb)nXH is used as the mono-sodium salt of ethylene, propylene or butylene glycol or amino-ethanol, -propanol or -butanol.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of the formula R1SO2Z can be carried out in a manner known per se for the manufacture of sulphonamides, e.g. in an inert organic solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide, conveniently while heating and in a protective gas atmosphere, e.g. under argon.<br>
The reaction in accordance with process variant c1) can be effected in a manner known per se preparation of carbamates and ureas from alcohols and, respectively, amines.   Thus, a compound of formula IV can be converted into a compound of formula 1 in which B    is -OC(0)NH- with an isocyanate of the formula R9NCO in a suitable anhydrous organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon such as toluene, conveniently while heating.   The isocyanate can be generated in situ, e.g. from an azide of the formula R^CONs by thermal decomposition. Likewise, compounds of formula I with B = -NHC(0)NH- can be obtained using compounds of formula IV in which B is NH.<br>
According to process variant c2) a compound of formula IV in which B is oxygen can be reacted with phosgene and thereafter with an alcohol of the formula R9OH to [give] a compound of formula I in<br><br>
which A is a residue -0C(0)0-.   A phosgene salt such as diphosgene (CI-COOCCI3) or triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2 can be used in place of phosgene.   Compounds of formula I with B = -NHC(0)0- are obtained analogously starting from compounds of formula IV with B = NH.   The phosgene is conveniently used as a solution in an inert anhydrous organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon such as toluene.   The reaction with phosgene can be carried out at room temperature.   The acid chloride obtained as an intermediate is reacted directly with the alcohol R90H, conveniently while heating.<br>
The reaction in accordance with process variant d) can be carried out under the reaction conditions described for process variant a) and yields compounds of formula I in which R3 is a residue -CHzO-A-lower-alkyl.<br>
Substituents present in the thus-obtained compound of formula I can be modified.  Thus, a methyl group R3 can be converted into a formyl group by oxidation,   the oxidation can be carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. with selenium dioxide.   The formyl group in the thus-obtained compound can be reduced to the hydroxymethyl group.   This reduction can be carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by means of reducing agents such as NaBH4.  The hydroxymethyl group can be converted into a halomethyl group by reaction with a halogenating agent such as POCI3/PCI5.   Furthermore, N-heterocyclic residues such as pyridile can be oxidized to N-oxides.   All of these reactions can be carried out according to methods known per se.   The compounds of formula I can be converted in a manner known per se into salts, e.g. alkali salts such as Na and K salts or alkaline earth metal salts such as Ca or Mg salts.<br>
The compounds which are used as starting materials, insofar as they are not known or their preparation is described hereinafter, can be prepared in analogy to known methods or methods described in more details below.<br>
The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I on endothelin receptors can be demonstrated using the test procedures described hereinafter:<br><br>
I:        Inhibition of endothelin binding to recombinant ETA^ receptors<br>
A cDNA coding for human ETA receptors of human placenta was cloned (M. Adachi, Y.-Y. Yang, Y. Furuichi and C. Miyamoto, BBRC 180. 1265-1272) and expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell system. Baculovirus-lnfected insect cells from a 23 I fermenter are centrifuged off (3000 x g, IS minutes, 4Â°C) 60 hours after the infection, re-suspended in Tris buffer<br>
(5 mM, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCIz) and again centrifuged.   After a further re-suspension and centrifugation the cells are suspended in 800 ml of the same buffer and freeze-dried at -120Â°C.   The cells disintegrate when the suspension in this hypotonic buffer mixture is thawed. After a repeated freeze-drying/thawing cycle the suspension is homogenized and centrifuged (25000 x g, 15 minutes, 4Â°C).  After suspension in Tris buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4, 25 mM MgCIz, 250 mM saccharose) 1 ml aliquots (protein content about 3.5 mg/ml) are stored at -85Â°C.<br>
For the binding assay, the freeze-dried membrane preparaÂ¬tions are thawed and, after centrifugation at 20Â°C and 25000 g for 10 minutes, re-suspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM MnCl2, 1   mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin).   100 Âµl of this membrane suspension containing 70 Âµg of protein are incubated with 50 Âµl of 125|-endothelin (specific<br>
activity 2200 Ci/mMol) in assay buffer (25000 cpm, final concentration 20 pM) and 100 Âµ\ of assay buffer containing varying<br>
concentrations of test compound.   The incubation is carried out at 20Â°C for 2 hours or at 4Â°C for 24 hours.  The separation of free and membrane-bound radio- ligands is carried out by filtration over a glass fibre filter.<br>
The inhibitory activity of compounds of formula I determined in this test procedure is given in Table 1 as the IC50, i.e. as the concentration [nM] which is required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding of T25[.endothelin.<br><br><br>
II.      Inhibition of endothelln-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta rings<br>
Rings with a length of 5 mm were cut out from the thorax aorta of adult Wistar-Kyoto rats.   The endothelium was removed by lightly rubbing the internal surface.   Each ring was immersed at 37Â°C In 10 ml of Krebs-Henseleit solution in an isolated bath while gassing with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.   The isometric stretching of the rings was measured.   The rings were stretched to a pre-tension of 3 g.   After incubation for 10 minutes with the test compound or vehicle cumulative dosages of endothelin-1 were added.   The activity of the test compound was ascertained by the observed shift to the right of the dosage-activity curve of endothelin-1 in the presence of different concentrations of antagonist.   This shift to the right (or "dose ratio", DR) corresponds to the quotient from the EC50 values of endothelin-1 in the presence and in the absence of antagonist, with the EC50 value denoting the endothelin concentration required for a half-maximum contraction.<br>
The corresponding PA2 value, which is a measure of the activity of the test compound, was calculated using a computer programme according to the following equation from the "dose ratio" DR for each individual dosage-activity curve .<br>
pA2 = log(DR-1)-log(antagonist-concentration)<br>
The EC50 of endothelin in the absence of test compounds is 0.3 nM.<br>
The pA2 values obtained with compounds of formula I are given in Table 2.<br><br><br>
On the basis of their capability of inhibiting endothelin binding, the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments for the treatment of disorders which are associated with vasoconstriction of increasing frequencies.   Examples of such disorders are high blood pressure, coronary disorders, cardiac insufficiency, renal and myocardial ischaemia,  renal insufficiency, dialysis,  cerebral ischaemia, cerebral infarct, migraine, subarachnoid haemorrhage, Raynaud syndrome and pulmonary high pressure.   They can also be used in atherosclerosis, the prevention of restenosis after balloon-induced vascular dilation, inflammations, gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcus cruris, gram-negative sepsis, shock, glomerulonephtritis, renal colic, glaucoma, asthma, in the therapy and prophylaxis of diabetic complications and complications in the administration of cyclosporin, as well as other disorders associated with endothelin activities.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be administered orally, rectally, parentally, e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally or transdermally; or sublingually or as opththalmological preparations, or as an areosol.   Capsules, tablets, suspensions or solutions for oral administration, suppositories, injection solutions, eye drops, salves or spray solutions are examples of administration forms.<br>
Intravenous, intramuscular or oral administration is a preferred form of use.  The dosages in which the compounds of formula I are administered in effective amounts depend on the nature of the specific active ingredient, the age and the requirements of the patient and the mode of administration.   In general, dosages of about<br><br>
0.1-100 mg/kg body weight per day come into consideration.   The preparations containing the compounds of formula I can contain inert or also pharmacodynamically active additives.   Tablets or granulates e.g. can contain a series of binders, fillers, carriers or diluents. Liquid preparations can be present, for example, in the form of a sterile water-miscible solution.    Capsules can contain a filler or thickener in addition to the active ingredient.   Furthermore, flavour-improving additives as well as substances usually used as preserving, stabilizing, moisture-retaining and emulsifying agents as well as salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers and other additives can also be present.<br>
The previously mentioned carrier materials and diluents can comprise organic or inorganic substances, e.g. water, gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arable, polyalkylene glycols and the like.   It is a prerequisite that all adjuvants used in the manufacture of the preparations are non-toxic.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention in more detail.<br>
Example 1<br>
1.29 g of Na were dissolved in 50 ml of ethylene glycol at 50Â°C.   Subsequently, 3.0 g of 5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic acid   6-chloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide were added portionwise at the same temperature and the mixture was heated at 100Â°C for 4 1/2 hours.  The clear reaction solution was poured on to ice/dilute HCI solution and the mixture was extracted 3 times with 0.2 I of ethyl acetate each time.   The organic phase was washed 3 times with water, dried over sodium sulphate and finally evaporated (sic) on a rotary evaporator.   5-tert-Butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic acid 6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide was thus obtained as a pale yellow foam. MS: 493 (M-S02).<br>
Preparation of the starting compound:<br>
a)      2.0 g of 5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonyl chloride were dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol at room temperature, treated with<br><br>
50 ml of 25% ammonia solution and heated at reflux for 4  1/2 hours.   The mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator, the residue was treated with water, extracted with ethyl acetate (150 ml), dried over magnesium sulphate and again concentrated on a rotary evaporator.   There was thus obtained 5-tert-butyl-2-thiophene-2-sulphonamide as white crystals.   MS: 219 (M).   The potassium salt was obtained therefrom with K tert.-butylate in methanol.<br>
b)      3.49 g of 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidine were dissolved in 125 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide, 3.855 g of (5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonamide) K were added at room temperature and the solution was subsequently stirred at room temperature for 20 hours.   It was then treated with a further 1.285 g of (5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonamide) K and left to react at room temperature for a further 2 hours.   200 ml of water [and] then 200 ml of ether were added to the reaction mixture while stirring vigorously, whereby a fine, white, crystalline precipitate formed and was filtered off under suction.   The crystals were suspended in dilute, aqueous hydrochloric acid and stirred at room temperature for 1/2 hour, filtered off under suction and dried in a high vacuum.   There was thus obtained 5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic  acid   6-chIoro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide as a white, crystalline solid. MS: 523.4 (M+H).<br>
Example 2<br>
A solution of 3.23 g of 5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic acid 6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide, 1.71   g of 2-pyridylcarboxylic acid azide and 70 mg of p-dimethylaminopyridine in toluene (50 ml) was heated at 80Â°C for 2 hours.  The toluene was removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue was partitioned between methylene chloride (0.5  I) and IN HCI solution (0.35 I).   The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulphate, the solvent was finally removed on a rotary evaporator.   The crude product was chromatographed over silica gel with methylene chloride/MeOH (5/1) as the eluent.   There was thus obtained pyridin-2-ylcarbamic   acid   2-[6-(5-tert-butyl-thiophen-2-yIsulphonylamino)-<br><br>
5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-yloxy]-ethyl ester as a pale yellow solid which was recrystallized from methylene chloride/MeOH. MS: 678.3 (M+H).<br>
Example 3<br>
26 mg of sodium were dissolved in 2 ml of ethanolamine at 50Â°C, treated portionwise at the same temperature with 150 mg of the compound from Example 1, paragraph b), and the solution was heated at 100Â°C for 4 hours.   Subsequently, the mixture was poured on to ice/water, adjusted to pH 6 with 3N HCI, whereby there separated a pale yellow, crystalline solid which was filtered off under suction, washed with water and dried in a high vacuum.   There was thus obtained  5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic  acid  6-(2-amino-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide   as yellow crystals. MS: 557.4 (M+H).<br>
Example 4<br>
100 mg of 5-tert-butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonic acid 6-(2-amino-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide were dissolved in 10 ml of toluene, treated with 53  mg of 2-pyridylcarboxylic acid azide and the solution was heated at 120Â°C for 4 hours.  The toluene was removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water.   The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulphate and finally concentrated on a rotary evaporator.  The residue was chromatographed on silica gel with methylene chloride/methanol (30/1) as the eluent.   There was thus obtained 5-tert-butyI-thiophen-2-sulphonic  acid  5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-6-[2-(3-pyridin-2-yl-ureido)-ethoxy]-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-ylamide   as   a   crystalline solid. MS: 677.4 (M+H).<br>
Example 5<br>
92 mg of NaH (65%) were added at room temperature to a solution of 162.5  mg of 4-amino-6-methoxy-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidine in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran, the solution<br><br>
was stirred at room temperature for 1   1/2 hours and subsequently 162.5  mg of 5-tert--butyl-thiophene-2-sulphonyl chloride were added at the same temperature.   The mixture was stirred at room temperature for a further 2  hours, poured on to ice/water, extracted with ethyl acetate, the aqueous phase was acidified and extracted with methylene chloride.   The combined, organic phases were dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was chromatographed over silica gel with methylene chloride/methanol (20/1) as the eluent.    5-tert--Butyl-N-[6-methoxy-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidin-4-yl]-thiophene-2-sulphonamide was obtained as a yellow powder. MS: 463 (M-S02).<br>
Preparation of the starting compounds:<br>
a)	2.09 g of 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyrimidine (EP-A- 0 526 708) were suspended in 75 ml of methanol and 150 ml of ammonia were condensed at 75Â°C using a feedpipe.   The reaction mixture was left to come to room temperature overnight, concentrated in a water-jet vacuum and the residue was partitioned between a small amount of water and methylene chloride (500 ml).
