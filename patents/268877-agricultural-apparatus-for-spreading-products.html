3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the general technical field of product-spreading and in particular to the field of spraying treatment products.<br>
The invention relates to an agricultural apparatus for spreading products comprising a frame and a product-spreading boom consisting of a central section and two lateral arms extending on either side of said central section.<br>
In the rest of the description, the product-spreading boom will be called simply boom and the product-spreading agricultural apparatus will be called agricultural apparatus.<br>
A mounted sprayer with a frame and a spreading boom consisting of a central section and two lateral arms extending on either side of said central section is known in the prior art. These lateral arms are deployed during work and are folded up in order to reduce the bulk of said boom during transport. In transport, each lateral arm is held by means of a respective retention support and is latched by means of a respective latch. To secure the position of the lateral arms, the latch is engaged in the respective retention support, thus the boom is rigidly fastened to the frame.<br>
During movement over bumpy ground during work as during transport, the sprayer sustains impacts that are caused by the tractor wheels passing over bumps and/or in holes. Since the boom is connected to the frame, it also sustains these impacts. Because of this connection of the boom on the frame, the impact on the boom is increased and the boom has to face considerable stresses. Repeated impacts cause a general fatigue which may cause the breakage of the boom and of the delicate equipment placed on the frame of the sprayer. With speed, the violence of the impacts is further increased. Consequently, the user is obliged to considerably reduce his speed of forward travel in transport as in work in order to attenuate these impacts and protect the boom in particular.<br>
2<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a device for an agricultural apparatus for spreading products making it possible ro overcome this drawback of the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, an important feature of the invention consists in that an anti-impact device is placed between said frame and said boom, said boom is connected to said frame by means of a crossmember and said crossmember is connected to said frame by means of at least one articulation with an axis that is substantially horizontal and perpendicular to the direction of forward travel.<br>
Thanks to this anti-impact device, the impacts due to passing over bumps both by the tractor wheels in the case of a mounted or self-propelled agricultural apparatus and by the wheels of the agricultural apparatus in the case of a trailed apparatus may effectively be absorbed during work as during transport. The whole of the agricultural apparatus and more precisely the boom 0f the therefore less stressed and consequently the service life of the apparatus and 0f the boom is prolonged. In addition, the user is no longer forced to reduce his speed of forward travel during movements on roads or in the fields.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will emerge from the claims and the following description of a nonlimiting exemplary embodiment of the invention with reference to the appended drawings in which:<br>
-	figure 1 represents a general view of an agricultural apparatus in the transport position comprising an anti-impact device according to the invention,<br>
-	figure 2 is a front view of the anti-impact device of figure 1,<br>
-	figure 3 is a side view of said anti-impact device of figure 1,<br>
-	figure 4 represents an anti-impact device according to a second exemplary embodiment.<br>
3<br><br>
Figure 1 represents a first exemplary embodiment of an agricultural apparatus for spreading products (1) comprising a frame (2) and a product-spreading boom (3). The frame (2) supports in particular the boom (3) and a tank (4). The boom (3) is intended to spread as uniformly as possible fertilizers, treatment products of the plant-care type, or other types of products to be spread contained in the tank (4) onto the ground or onto crops. For this, the agricultural apparatus (1) is moved in a line and direction of forward travel indicated by the arrow (A) by means of a tractor. The boom (3) is only partially shown in the figures.<br>
In the rest of the description, the concepts of "front" and "rear", "in front of" and "behind" are defined with reference to the direction of forward travel (A) and the concepts of "right" and "left" are defined while looking at the agricultural apparatus (1) from the rear in said direction of forward travel (A).<br>
In a known manner, the boom (3) consists of two lateral arms (5A, 5B) and a central section (6). One lateral arm (5A, 5B) is placed on either side of the central section (6). Each lateral arm (5 A, 5B) may be made in one or more sections. These sections are, in a known manner, connected respectively to one another by means of articulations. Only the intermediate sections (7A, 7B) are shown in the figures. Each section (7A, 7B) is intended to carry spreading means for spreading products onto the ground or onto the crops. The spreading means are, for example, spray nozzles in the case of an agricultural sprayer. These spreading means are not shown in the figures. In a generally known manner, the boom (3) is centered relative to the frame (2). The intermediate sections (7A, 7B) and the outer sections are placed substantially symmetrically relative to the vertical mid-plane (8) of the frame (2) of the spreading apparatus (1).<br>
During product-spreading work, the lateral arms (5A, 5B) of the boom (3) are deployed so as to cover a broad strip of ground: the boom (3) therefore extends transversely to the direction of forward travel (A) and substantially parallel to the ground. The boom (3) is, in a known manner, suspended from the frame (2) by<br>
4<br><br>
means of a suspension device (9). The role of the suspension device (9) is to absorb and to attenuate the movements of the tractor to prevent them being directly and completely transmitted to the boom (3) so that the latter can have an optimal behaviour in the field. The function of the suspension device (9) is to suspend the boom (3), from the frame (2) of the agricultural apparatus (1) by allowing in particular a correct orientation of the boom (3) according to the configuration of the ground over which the agricultural apparatus (1) travels.<br>
Furthermore, the boom (3) is connected to the frame (2) of the spreading apparatus (1) in an adjustable manner in order to adapt the spreading height to the nature of the plants to be treated and to their level of development. Specifically/ for the best effectiveness of the treatment, the spreading means must be at a certain height relative to the plants. This height adjustment is made in a known manner, by positioning the boom (3) on the frame (2) via an actuator means (10). Under the action of the actuator means such as a manual winch, a hydraulic cylinder, etc., the boom (3) moves in translation on the frame (2) by means of a carriage (11). For this purpose, the frame (2) comprises two rails (13) on which the carriage (11) that carries the boom (3) moves. The two rails (13) are placed symmetrically relative to the vertical mid-plane (8) and constitute a guide for the carriage (11). The rails (13) extend substantially vertically and on either side of the vertical mid-plane (8). The boom (3) via said carriage (11) is connected to the actuator means (10) via a traction member (12). Therefore, the boom (3) is raised or lowered and then held at a determined height relative to the ground. In light of the figures, the actuator means (10) is advantageously a hydraulic cylinder and the traction member (12) is advantageously a cable.<br>
For transport, the lateral arms (5A, 5B) are folded in a known manner so as to reduce the bulk of the boom (3) and particularly in order to comply with the size authorized for traveling on the public highway. The outer section and the intermediate section(s) (7A, 7B) of each arm (5A, 5B) of the boom (3) are folded up, respectively unfolded substantially to the horizontal for work, by means respectively of at least<br>
5<br><br>
one actuator and at least one elastic system, about the articulations connecting them to one another. The actuators are for example hydraulic cylinders. Each actuator extends between the central section (6) and the respective adjacent intermediate section (7A, 7B). The corresponding outer section and, as appropriate/ the additional intermediate section(s) (7A, 7B) are, for their part, folded, respectively unfolded thanks to the corresponding elastic system.<br>
When the two lateral arms (5A, 5B) are folded for transport, each lateral arm (5A, 5B) is held by respectively a retention support (14A, 14B) and a latch (15A, 15B). Each lateral arm (5A, 5B) comprises a respective latch (15A, 15B). The frame (2) is fitted with a retention support (14A, 14B) on either side of the vertical mid-plane (8). The retention support (14A, 14B) is configured so as to guide the movement of the respective lateral arm (5A, 5B) during folding. For this purpose, it has a U-shape which guides and limits the movements forward and rearward relative to the direction of forward travel (A) of each lateral arm (5A, 5B) during folding. The latches (15A, 15B) are, for their part, designed to prevent an accidental unfolding of the lateral arms (5A, 5B) during transport. When the lateral arms are folded for transport, the position of each lateral arm (5A, 5B) is latched relative to the frame (2) by a respective latch (15A, 15B). The latching is carried out by the engagement of the latch (15A, 15B) in said corresponding retention support (14A, 14B). Each of the lateral arms (5A, 5B) is fitted with such a latch (15A, 153).<br>
For the folding of the lateral arms (5A, 5B) in order to arrive at the transport position, the boom (3) is positioned at mid-height on the rails (13) of the frame (2) by means of the hydraulic cylinder (10). Then the intermediate sections (7A, 7B) and respectively the outer sections are folded up via the respective actuator and elastic system. When the intermediate sections (7A, 7B) and the outer sections are fully folded, the boom (3) is lowered by means of the hydraulic cylinder (10) to a lower level. During this downward translation, the latches (15A, 15B) engage in the respective retention support (14A, 14B) and so the lateral arms (5A, 5B) are latched onto the frame (2). The boom (3) is then rigidly fastened to the frame (2).<br>
6<br><br>
From the transport position, in order to place the boom (3) in its working position, the various steps described above are carried out in the reverse direction: unlatching and unfolding of the lateral arms (5A, 5B) and finally adjustment of the spreading height.<br>
According to an important feature of the invention, the agricultural apparatus (1) comprises an anti-impact device (16) which is placed between said frame (2) and said boom (3), said boom (3) is connected to said frame (2) by means of a crossmember (19) and said crossmember (19) is connected to said frame (2) by means of at least one articulation (18A, 18B) with an axis that is substantially horizontal and perpendicular to the direction of travel (A). Said anti-impact device (16) makes it possible to prevent at least partially the transmission of the impacts from said boom (3) to said frame (2). Therefore, the impacts due to traveling over bumps both by the tractor wheels in the case of a mounted or self-propelled agricultural apparatus and by the wheels of the agricultural apparatus in the case of a trailed apparatus may effectively be absorbed. The user is then no longer forced to reduce his speed of forward travel (A) during the movements on the highways or in the fields. The whole of the agricultural apparatus (1) and the boom (3) is therefore less stressed by the irregularities of the ground and consequently the service life of the boom (3) in particular is prolonged.<br>
The anti-impact device (16) is placed between said frame (2) and said crossmember (19). The boom (3) is connected to said crossmember (19) by means of a traction member (12). The anti-impact device (16) is intended to operate between the frame (2) and the boom (3). It absorbs and attenuates the impacts between the boom (3) and the frame (2) and vice versa. The impact of bumpy ground or of obstacles on the boom (3) is consequently limited during transport when the lateral arms (5A, 5B) are folded as during work when the lateral arms (5A, 5B) are deployed. During work, the boom (3) is then suspended by the traction member (12) from the crossmember (19). The anti-impact device (16) provided between the boom (3) and the frame (2) or the crossmember (19) absorbs the vertical impacts when the tractor wheels encounter<br>
7<br><br>
obstacles.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown, said agricultural apparatus (1) is of the sprayer type carried by a tractor. Therefore, the whole of the weight of the sprayer, with the tank (4) intended to contain a treatment liquid, is carried by the tractor. In a known manner, the sprayer also comprises means (not shown) for pumping the treatment liquid contained in said tank (4) in order to send it under pressure to said spray nozzles. Said treatment liquid is therefore deposited in fine droplets on the plants or on the ground to be treated. Since such nozzles are widely known, they have not been represented in the figures and they will not be described further.<br>
During the travels from the farm to the field or from one field to another field, the sprayer has to be moved over roads and tracks by means of a tractor. Therefore, it must comply with the regulations in force for traffic on the public highways, particularly as concerns its width. For this, the lateral arms (5A, 5B) of the boom (3), placed behind the tank (4), are folded up, as described above. In the case of a mounted sprayer, it is the tractor wheels that run over the bumps, into the holes or the ruts, etc., during transport. These irregularities cause impacts due to a sudden vertical downward movement of one of the wheels, when the wheel falls into a hole or upward movement when the wheel runs over a bump. The anti-impact device<br>
(16)	is intended to absorb these impacts so that they are not transmitted to the boom (3). For this purpose, the anti-impact device (16) comprises at least one compression spring (17) intended to operate between the frame (2) and the boom (3). This spring<br>
(17)	extends essentially vertically so as to absorb the vertical impacts. The spring (17) absorbs and releases the energy due to the impact; it gives an oscillating movement to the crossmember (19). This spring (17) could be replaced by any equivalent elastic means.<br>
The crossmember (19) extends substantially horizontally and perpendicular to the direction of forward travel (A). It extends substantially above the rails (13A, 13B) of said frame (2). The crossmember (19) advantageously has a U-shape placed flat,<br>
8<br><br>
whose feet are connected to said frame (2) via articulations (18A, 18B). In a particularly advantageous manner the crossmember (19) carries two retention supports (14A, 14B). One retention support (14A, 14B) is mounted on each foot of the U-shaped crossmember (19). For transport, the latch (15A, 15B) makes it possible to hold said respective lateral arm (5A, 5B) on said frame (2) by means of the respective retention support (14A, 14B).<br>
According to the exemplary embodiment represented in the figures, the anti-impact device (16) advantageously comprises two springs (17A, 17B). One spring (17A, 17B) is placed on each side of the vertical mid-plane (8) of the frame (2). The springs (17A, 17B) extend in the vicinity of a corresponding retention support (14A, 14B). The springs (17A, 17B) preferably extend in the vertical plane, perpendicular to the direction of forward travel (A), containing the corresponding retention supports (14A, 14B). Said spring (17A, 17B) is placed directly between the frame (2) and the corresponding retention support (14A, 14B).<br>
In the light of figure 3, it can be seen that the retention supports (14A, 14B) with the crossmember (19) are connected to the frame (2) by means of respective articulations (18A, 18B) placed symmetrically on either side of the vertical mid-plane (8) of the frame (2). Each articulation (18A, 18B) has an axis that is substantially horizontal and perpendicular to the direction of forward travel (A). Therefore, when there is an impact, the springs (17A, 17B) compress and the retention supports (14A, 14B) and the crossmember (19) pivot about their respective articulation (18A, 18B). The articulations (18A, 18B) are placed behind the retention device (14A, 14B) with respect to the direction of forward travel (A). Thanks to this anti-impact device (16), the impacts of the boom (3) on the frame (2) at the retention supports (14A, 14B) during transport with the lateral arms (5A, 5B) folded, are effectively and directly absorbed by the springs (17A, 17B). The latches (15A, 15B) of each lateral arm (5A, 5B) are therefore preserved.<br>
9<br><br>
According to another exemplary embodiment represented in figure 4, the anti-impact device (16) comprises, in addition, at least one shock absorber (20) placed between the frame (2) and the retention support (14A, 14B). Advantageously, the anti-impact device (16) comprises two shock absorbers (20A, 20B) configured to operate in parallel with the two springs (17A, 17B). One shock absorber (20A, 20B) is placed on each side of the vertical mid-plane (8) of the frame (2). Each shock absorber (20A, 20B) is intended to operate between the frame (2) and the crossmember (19) carrying the retention supports (14A, 14B). The shock absorbers (20A, 20B) extend substantially vertically and damp the pivoting movements of the crossmember (19) about the corresponding articulation (18A, 18B). Each shock absorber (20A, 20B) is connected on the one hand to one of the rails (13 A, 13B) of the frame (2) and on the other hand to a foot of the crossmember (19). The presence of these shock absorbers (20A, 20B) improves the operation of the anti-impact device (16) with the springs (17A, 17B) because the vertical accelerations are immediately absorbed. The anti-impact device (16) then stabilizes more quickly, because the function of the shock absorber (20A, 20B) is to slow down the oscillations due to the presence of the springs (17A, 17B). A shock absorber dissipates the energy and suppresses the oscillating movement given by a spring. The anti-impact device (16) makes it possible to isolate the movements of the boom (3) from those of the tractor. Note in the light of figure 4 that the spring (17A, 17B) is advantageously placed between the corresponding articulation (18A, 18B) and the corresponding shock absorber (20A, 20B).<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment not shown, the anti-impact device (16) comprises a single spring (17) placed substantially in the vertical mid-plane (8) of the frame (2). The spring (17) may be associated with a shock absorber (20).<br>
According to yet another exemplary embodiment not shown, the anti-impact device (16) is placed on the boom (3) at the lateral arms (5A, 5B). More precisely, the springs (17A, 17B) of the anti-impact device (16) are placed between the latch (15A, 15B) and the intermediate section (7A, 7B).<br>
10<br><br>
The invention also relates to a product-spreading agricultural apparatus of the trailed or self-propelled type comprising a product-spreading boom (3) according to the invention.<br>
The invention applies more particularly to agricultural sprayers, but may also apply to spreaders of fertilizer or other products.<br>
It is very clear that the invention is not limited to the embodiment described above and represented in the appended drawings. Modifications are still possible, particularly with respect to the constitution or number of the various elements or by substitution of technical equivalents, without, for all that, departing from the field of protection as is defined by the following claims.<br>
