THE    FOLLOWING    SPECIFICATION    PARTICULARLY    DESCRIBES    THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED,<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to synthesis of Triflic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Triflic acid (Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) is a sulfonic acid with the chemical formula CF3SO3H. It is one of the strongest acids and is mainly used in research as a catalyst for esterification. Triflic acid is a hygroscopic, colorless liquid at room temperature. It is soluble in polar solvents such as DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfone. Triflic acid is a non-oxidizing thermally stable compound and is resistant to both oxidation and reduction. In the laboratory, triflic acid is useful in protonations because the conjugate base of triflic acid is non-nucleophilic. Triflic acid promotes other Friedel-Crafts-like reactions including the cracking of alkanes and alkylation of alkenes, which are very important to the petroleum industry. These triflic acid derivative catalysts are very effective in isomerizing straight chain or slightly branched hydrocarbons that can increase the octane rating of particular petroleum based fuel.<br>
Triflic acid is also used in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical industries. Derivatives of Triflic acid are used as a component of lithium batteries, thus finds use in various electronic items viz. calculators, laptops, digital cameras, mobiles, watches and the like.<br>
 <br>
There are various processes available for the synthesis of Triflic acid, viz. Oxidation of bis (trifluoromethylthio) mercury with hydrogen peroxide, formation of its barium salt, followed by its reaction with sulfuric acid to evolve Triflic acid (Hazeldine &amp; Kidd, JCS 1954, 4228). However, mercury is a poisonous metal and hence the process is not desirable.<br>
Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is also produced by electrochemical fluorination (ECF) of methanesulfonic acid:<br>
CH3SO3H + 4 HF -&gt; CF3S02F + H20 + 1.5 H2<br>
The resulting CF3SO2F is hydrolyzed and the resulting triflate salt is preprotonated. Alternatively, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid arises by oxidation of trifluoromethylsulfenyl chloride:<br>
CF3SCI + 2 Cl2 + 2 H20 -&gt; CF3S02OH + 4 HC1<br>
Triflic acid is then purified by distillation from triflic anhydride.<br>
Oxidation of bis-(trifluoromethyl) disulphane to Triflic acid by various oxidizing agents is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5059711. However, Bis-(trifluoromethyl)disulphane can not be readily synthesized and is not easily available.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a synthetic route for Triflic acid using readily available raw material and which obviates the use of poisonous chemicals.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a synthetic route for Triflic acid using easily available raw materials.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a synthetic route for Triflic acid that obviates the use of poisonous/toxic chemicals.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a simple and commercially attractive route for the synthesis of triflic acid.<br>

 <br>
The reaction mixture is then further maintained at the same temperature for a period of about 4 to about 8 hours at 0.1 to 1.0 kg/cm2 pressure. The temperature is then increased to about 25°C to about 45 °C and the reaction is further continued by maintaining the reaction mixture at the same temperature and pressure for a time effective to form a biphasic product mixture containing an organic layer and an aqueous layer. The product (trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride) is formed in the organic layer. The organic layer is then separated and distilled to give pure trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention water is used as a solvent during chloroxidation step and thus avoids the use of double solvent system.<br>
The obtained trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride is further hydrolyzed using water at liquid temperature of about 70 to about 120°C and at a pressure of about 3 to about 6 kg/cm2 without using any solvent to get Triflic acid monohydrate.

The above synthesis of triflic acid represents the only synthesis, which does not use the rather aggressive reaction condition in which electrochemical fluorination of methanesulfonyl chloride is carried out using HF as well as other synthesis where ozone depleting substances are used.<br>
 <br>
The present invention will now be explained below in further detail with examples of specific embodiments. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted to the specific examples given below.<br>
Example 1:<br>
In a reactor, 226.5 gm (1.0 M) of ortho-chlorobenzyltrifluoromethylsulphide was mixed with 1000 ml of water to obtain a mixture. The mixture was then cooled to 10°C followed by passing the chlorine gas (142 gm, 4 moles) into the mixture over a period of 3 to 4 hours, at 0.1 to 1.0 kg/cm2 pressure. After passing the chlorine gas the reaction mixture was further maintained at the same temperature and pressure for 6 hours.<br>
The temperature was then raised to 25 to 30°C and the reaction was further continued at raised temperature for 10 hours. After completion of the reaction, a two phase product mixture containing an organic layer and an aqueous layer was obtained. As the organic layer contains trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride, it was separated from two phase mixture and trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride was obtained by distilling the organic layer. Weight of distilled trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride was found to be 152 gm with 99.5% purity. 168.5 gm of the trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride thus isolated was reacted with 750 ml of water and heated to 80°C in a glass pressure reactor. Typically, the initial pressure inside the reactor is about 4.5 to 5 kg/cm2. The reaction mixture was further heated at 80-85°C for 16 hrs in order to drop the pressure inside the reactor. Typically, the pressure drop is about 0.5 kg./cm2. The pressure drop indicates complete conversion of Trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride to Triflic acid.<br>
 <br>
Then water was removed from the reaction mass and the obtained Trifiic acid monohydrate was vacuum distilled to get 165 gm of Trifiic acid monohydrate with 88% purity.<br>
170 gm (88% pure) hydrated Trifiic acid was treated with 148 gm of thionyl chloride at 50 to 55°C and maintained at same temperature till no evolution of off gases. Crude anhydrous Trifiic acid was then vacuum distilled to get anhydrous 149 gm of Trifiic acid having purity more than 99.5%.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In a reactor, 226.5 gm (1.0 M) of ortho-chlorobenzyltrifluoromethylsulphide was mixed with 1000 ml of water to obtain a mixture. The mixture was then cooled to 10°C followed by passing the chlorine gas (177 gm, 5 moles) into the mixture over a period of 3 to 4 hours, at 0.1 to 1.0 kg/cm pressure. After passing the chlorine gas, the reaction mixture was further maintained at the same temperature and pressure for 6 hours.<br>
The temperature was then raised to 25 to 30°C and the reaction was further continued at raised temperature for 10 hours. After completion of the reaction, two phase product mixture containing an organic layer and an aqueous layer was obtained. As the organic layer contains trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride, it was separated from two phase mixture and trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride was obtained by distilling the organic layer. Weight of distilled trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride was found to be 155 gm with 99.5% purity. 168.5 gm of the trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride thus isolated was reacted with 1000 ml of water and heated to 80°C in a glass pressure reactor. Typically, the initial pressure inside the reactor is about 4.5 to 5 kg/cm2. The reaction mixture was further heated at 80-85°C for 16 hrs in order to drop the pressure inside the<br>
 <br>
reactor. Typically, the pressure drop is about 0.5 kg./cm2. The pressure drop indicates complete conversion of Trifluoromethyl sulphonyl chloride to Triflic acid.<br>
Then water was removed from the reaction mass and the obtained Triflic acid monohydrate was vacuum distilled to get 167 gm of Triflic acid monohydrate with 88% purity.<br>
170 gm (88% pure) hydrated Triflic acid was treated with 143 gm of thionyl chloride at 50 to 55°C and maintained at same temperature till no evolution of off gases. Crude anhydrous Triflic acid was then vacuum distilled to get anhydrous 149 gm of Triflic acid having purity more than 99.5%.<br>
