DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING 1,2-PHENYLETHANE COMPOUND U3IHC- ATOM TRANSFER RADICAL COUPLING REACTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
This application claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-074463 filed on 17 March 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a 1,2-phenylethane compound, and particularly to a method for producing a 1,2-phenyIethane compound using a transition metal compound as a catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Tetrakis (hydroxyphenyl)alkane can be used as a host compound in polymolecular clathxate compounds.  For example, 1, 1, 2, 2-tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane selectively forms clathrate compounds {compounds having an inclusion of guest molecule in a cavity formed by the host molecule} with various organic guest compounds and therefore i~'3 application is expected in technical fields such as selective separation, chemical stabilization, prevention of<br><br>
vaporization and pulverization.<br>
[0003]<br>
Up until the present, as a method for producing tetrakis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes, a method of condensing phenol and glyoxal in acetic acid in a temperature range cf 2 to 10DC in the presence of sulfuric acid is known'for example, Non-Eatent Document 1}.<br>
[0004]<br>
In addition, there is a method for producing tetrakis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes by condensing glyoxal and phenol in excess with respect to glyoxal in a temperature range of 100 to 1B0°C in the presence of hydrochlcric acid<br>
(for example, Patent Document 1) or a method characterize." by condensing phenol and a dialdehyde or derivatives thereof in the presence of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid (for example, Patent Document 2).<br>
[0005]<br>
However as shown by the method disclosed in Parer.c Document 1, a reaction using a single sulfuric acid catalyst is difficult to control and tends to be associated with side reactions or runaway reactions. Furthermore although reactions at high temperatures using phenol in excess have characters such as no requirement of react:ien solvents, a short reaction time and a low cost, there is tendency for side reactions and high yields are net<br><br>
expected. Moreover there is the problem that it is extremely difficult to eliminate multiple produces resulting from such side reactions. [0006]<br>
As shown by the method disclosed in Patent Document 2, side reactions can be suppressed by condensation in the presence of a mixed acidic catalyst' comprising sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid resulting in highly efficient arc selective production of tetrakis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes. However, the yield is on the order of 40 to 70% acid the reaction time requires from several to tens of hoars. [0007]<br>
As shown  by the method disclosed in Patent a compound having a tetrakis phenyl backbone combining ester groups with phenyl groups can  be produced by a coupling reaction using a zinc catalyst. However this method requires'a 24-hour reflux process, and has = lor:g reaction time and a low yield. [0008] Non-Patent Document 1:<br>

After deg£.sstng the solution and heating the solution to 80°C, 1.8 g ;i3 mmol; of N,N,N' ,W ,N"-per.taraethyl diethylene triaraine was added. The mixture was stirred at 80°C for 0.5 h and coded :: room temperature.  The reaction mixture was filtered =nd the insoluble matter was washed with water for three times. 100 mL of chloroform was added to the insoluble matter, end refluxed for 10 minutes and filtered while still hct.<br><br>
After the concentration of the filtrate, the was washed with ethyl acetate to give 3.1 g of 2 floccular crystal C (isolated yield 76%).<br>
Then 2.6 g (3-2 miriol) of the crystal C, and  of toluene were charged into 100 mL reaction flask, Hydrolysis products saponified in the presence of potassium. hydroxide and water were purified to give 1.1 g (2.8 mmol) powder of 1,1, 2, 2-tetrakis (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethane<br><br><br>
