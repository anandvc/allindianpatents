				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of aliphatic-aromatic compatibilizers. More particularly it relates<br><br>
to a process for the preparation of compatibilizers using dicarboxy terminated poly(1,4-thiophenylene) with an aliphat'ic-aromatic liquid crystalline polymers. The compatibilizers prepared by the process of this invention are useful in the preparation of compatibilized blends of poly(phenylene sulphide) with thermotropic . liquid crystalline polymers. The compatibilizers prepared by the process of this invention are new.<br>
Compatibilizers for polymers could be defined as materials that induce miscibility in two immiscible polymers. Conventionally these materials comprise of block or graft copolymers with long segments or blocks that have characteristics of miscibility at the interface. The addition of compatibilizers reduces the interfacial energy between the immiscible phases and they also ensure finer dispersion when two immiscible phases are brought together during mixing operation. They also provide better stability against separation of the two phases and increase the adhesion at phase boundaries giving improved stress transfer.<br>
Compatibilization of blend components is an important factor to be considered when designing blends and is often the primary criterion for commercial success.<br>
Blending of thermoplastic polymers are resorted when the<br><br>
resultant material can lead to easier processing and in situ matrix reinforcement in some cases depending on the choice of the polymers that are used for blending.<br>
An important reason in seeking new polymer blends is cost-effectiveness, coupled with synergistic improvement in the properties of the individual polymers.<br>
A number of different approaches to achieve compatibilization have been attempted. These are :<br>
1.	Addition of  functional/reactive polymers ;<br>
2.	In  situ grafting/polymerization(reactive blending) and<br>
3.	Addition of block copolymers.<br>
The addition of block or graft copolymers represents the most researched approach to the compatibilization of blends. It is known that block copolymers containing segments chemically identical to the blend components can be used as as a compatibilizer. The copolymer should meet certain structural and molecular requirements and it should locate at interfaces.<br>
*<br>
For example, extensive studies of compatibilization of low density polyethylene/polystyrene blends using block copolymers (diblock styrene-ethylene butadiene) [Barentsen, W.M., Heikens, D. and Piet. P., Polymer, 15, 119 (1974); Fayt, R., Jerome, R. and Teyssie, Ph., J. Polymn. Sci, Polym. Lett. Edn., 24, 25, (1986); Fayt, R., Jerome, R. and Teyssie, Ph., Macromol. Chem., 187, 837, (1986). Ethylene-propylene copolymers have found some<br><br>
success as compatibilizers for blends of poly ethylene and poly propylene [Nolley, E., Barlow, J.W. and Paul, D.R., Polym. Eng. Sci. 20, 364, (1980). The preparation of block copolymers of PPS telechelics with polyamides and other thermoplastic polymers have been reported [Freund, L. and Heitz, W., MAkromol. Chem. 191, 815, (1990)] .<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of aliphatic-aromatic compatibilizers based on oligo poly(phenylene sulphide) and poly ethylene terephthalate-oxy benzoate polymers.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of aliphatic-aromatic compatibilizers, which comprises reacting in an inert atmosphere, dicarboxy terminated poly(1,4-thiophenylene) with an aliphatic-aromatic liquid crystalline polymers at temperatures in. the range of 260 to 300°C, under constant stirring of the reactants, for a period ranging from 2 to 4 hours, continuing the reaction for a further period of 2 to 3 hours under reduced pressure collecting the product in the form" a viscous slurry at a temperature in the range of 160 to 180°.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the inert gas used<br><br>
may be such as 	nitrogen, argon <br>
In another embodiment of the present invention,  the<br>
aliphatic-aromatic  liquid crystalline polymer used may be such as    <br>
poly(ethylene terephthalate - oxybenzoate)  polymer having<br><br>
oxybenzoate concentration varying from 30 to 60 %.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the repeat unit of 1,4-thiophenylene of the dicarboxy terminated poly(1,4-thiophenylene) may vary from 6 to 12.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of the dicarboxy poly(1,4-thiophenylene) to the aliphatic-aromatic thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer may be in the range from 25 to 75 %.<br>
The process of the present invention is described with reference to following examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention in any manner.<br>
