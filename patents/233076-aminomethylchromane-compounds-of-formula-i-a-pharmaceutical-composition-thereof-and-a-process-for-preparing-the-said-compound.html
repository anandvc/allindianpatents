pyrimidinone; a stereoisomeric form thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salt;<br>
(R)-l-[3-[[(3,4-dihydro-2//-l-benzopyran-2-yl)methyl]amino]propyl]-tetrahydro-2(lH)-<br>
pyrimidinone; or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof; and<br><br>

The compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by alkylating an intermediate of formula (III) with an intermediate of formula (II), wherein W is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, halo, e.g. fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, or in some instances W may also be a sulfonyloxy group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy, benzenesulfonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy and the like reactive leaving groups. The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calciumoxide or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and, if desired, the reaction may be carried out in an autoclave at an increased pressure.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reductively alkylating an intermediate of formula (IV), wherein Alk1' represents a direct bond or C^alkanediyl, following art-known reductive alkylation procedures with an intermediate of formula<br>
(m).<br>
Said reductive alkylation can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol, toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of a reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or triacetoxy borohydride. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal, rhodium-on-carbon or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydrogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a dehydrating agent to the<br>
reaction mixture such as, for example, aluminium te/t-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. To enhance the rate of the reaction, the temperature may be elevated in a range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and optionally the pressure of the hydrogen gas may be raised.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an acid chloride of formula (V), wherein Alk1' represents Q.salkanediyl or a direct bond, with an intermediate of formula (III) under suitable reaction conditions.<br>
Said reaction can be performed under hydrogenation conditions with hydrogen gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal, rhodium-on-carbon or platinum-on-charcoal, in a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethyl acetate, and in the presence of magnesiumoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g. thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. To enhance the rate of the reaction, the temperature may be elevated in a range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and optionally the pressure of the hydrogen gas may be raised.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-a), defined as compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is a radical of formula (c-1) wherein R7 is hydrogen, X1 represents oxygen or sulfur and Q is a bivalent radical of formula (d-2), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VI) with an intermediate of formula (VII) in a reaction-inert solvent such as, e.g. tetrahydrofuran and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may further be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions. For instance, compounds of formula (I) wherein R6 is phenylmethyl can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula (I) wherein R6 is hydrogen by art-known debenzylation procedures. Said debenzylation can be performed following art-known procedures such as catalytic hydrogenation using appropriate catalysts, e.g. platinum on charcoal, palladium on charcoal, in appropriate solvents such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. Furthermore, compounds of formula (I) wherein R6 is hydrogen may be alkylated using art-known procedures such as, e.g. reductive TV-alkylation with a suitable aldehyde or ketone, or compounds of formula (I) wherein R^ is hydrogen can be reacted with an acyl halide or an acid anhydride.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its TV-oxide form. Said TV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarbo-peroxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzene-carboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediates are known compounds and are commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, a number of intermediates of formula (II), (VI) or (V) may be prepared according to art-known methodologies described in WO-93/17017 and WO-95/053837.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates may have one or more stereogenic centers in their structure, present in a R or a S configuration, such as, e.g. the carbon atom bearing the R4 substituent, and the carbon atom linked to the -Alk^A-R5 moiety.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the TV-oxide forms, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof possess favourable fundic relaxation properties as evidenced in pharmacological example C-l, the "Gastric tone measured by an electronic barostat in conscious dogs"-test.<br>
Furthermore, as demonstrated in pharmacological example C.2 "Vasoconstrictive activity on basilar artery", the compounds of the present invention have additional beneficial pharmacological properties in that they have little or no vasoconstrictor activity. Vasconstrictor activity can cause undesirable side-effects such as coronary spasms which can induce chest pain.<br>
In view of the capability of the compounds of the present invention to relax the fundus, the subject compounds are useful to treat conditions related to a hampered or impaired relaxation of the fundus such as, e.g. dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating and anorexia.<br>
Dyspepsia is described as a motility disorder. Symptoms can be caused by a delayed gastric emptying or by impaired relaxation of the fundus to food ingestion. Warmblooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from<br>
dyspeptic symptoms as a result of delayed gastric emptying usually have a normal fundic relaxation and can be relieved of their dyspeptic symptoms by administering a prokinetic agent such as, e.g. cisapride. Patients can have dyspeptic symptoms without having a disturbed gastric emptying. Their dyspeptic symptoms may result from a hypercontracted fundus or hypersensitivity resulting in a diminished compliance and abnormalities in the adaptive fundic relaxation. A hypercontracted fundus results in a diminished compliance of the stomach. The "compliance of the stomach" can be expressed as the ratio of the volume of the stomach over the pressure exerted by the stomach wall. The compliance of the stomach relates to the gastric tone, which is the result of the tonic contraction of muscle fibers of the proximal stomach. This proximal part of the stomach, by exerting a regulated tonic contraction (gastric tone), accomplishes the reservoir function of the stomach.<br>
Patients suffering from early satiety cannot finish a normal meal since they feel saturated before they are able to finish said normal meal. Normally when a subject starts eating, the stomach will show an adaptive relaxation, i.e. the stomach will relax to accept the food that is ingested. This adaptive relaxation is not possible when the compliance of the stomach is hampered which results in an impaired relaxation of the fundus.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), it follows that the present invention also provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from impaired relaxation of the fundus to food ingestion. Consequently a method of treatment is provided for relieving patients suffering from conditions, such as, for example, dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating and anorexia.<br>
Hence, the use of a compound of formula (I) as medicine is provided, and in particular the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicine for treating conditions involving an impaired relaxation of the fundus to food ingestion. Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment are envisaged.<br>
The symptoms of impaired fundic relaxation may also arise due to the intake of chemical substances, e.g. Selective Seretonine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRI's), such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram and sertraline.<br>
Another functional gastrointestinal disorder is irritable bowel syndrome whereby one of its features is believed to be related to hypersensitivity of the gut to distension. Hence it<br>
is therefore believed that modulation of said hypersensitivity by the compounds of the present invention having fundus relaxation properties may result in a reduction of the symptoms in subjects suffering from IBS. Accordingly the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicine for treating IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is provided.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically<br>
discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of solid dose forms, for example, tablets (both swallowable-only and chewable forms), capsules or gelcaps, prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means, optionally with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners comprise preferably at least one intense sweetener such as saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sodium cyclamate, alitame, a dihydrochalcone sweetener, monellin, stevioside or sucralose (4,r,6'-trichloro-4,r,6'-trideoxyga/flcrosucrose), preferably saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, and optionally a bulk sweetener such as sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, isomalt, glucose, hydrogenated glucose syrup, xylitol, caramel or honey.<br>
Intense sweeteners are conveniently employed in low concentrations. For example, in the case of sodium saccharin, the concentration may range from 0.04% to 0.1% (w/v) based on the total volume of the final formulation, and preferably is about 0.06% in the low-dosage formulations and about 0.08% in the high-dosage ones. The bulk sweetener<br>
can effectively be used in larger quantities ranging from about 10% to about 35%, preferably from about 10% to 15% (w/v).<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable flavours which can mask the bitter tasting ingredients in the low-dosage formulations are preferably fruit flavours such as cherry, raspberry, black currant or strawberry flavour. A combination of two flavours may yield very good results. In the high-dosage formulations stronger flavours may be required such as Caramel Chocolate flavour, Mint Cool flavour, Fantasy flavour and the like pharmaceutically acceptable strong flavours. Each flavour may be present in the final composition in a concentration ranging from 0.05% to 1% (w/v). Combinations of said strong flavours are advantageously used. Preferably a flavour is used that does not undergo any change or loss of taste and colour under the acidic conditions of the formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, conveniently intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, for example by bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as isotonizing, suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
For intranasal administration the compounds of the invention may be used, for example, as a liquid spray, as a powder or in the form of drops.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may optionally include an anti-flatulent, such as simethicone, alpha-D-galactosidase and the like.<br>
In general it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount would be from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.02 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight. A method of treatment may also include administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between two or four intakes per day.<br>

C. Pharmacological examples<br>
C. 1. Gastric tone measured by an electronic barostat in conscious dogs<br>
Gastric tone cannot be measured by manometric methods. Therefore an electronic<br>
barostat was used. This allows the study of the physiological pattern and regulation of<br>
gastric tone in conscious dogs and the influence of test-compounds on this tone.<br>
The barostat consists of an air injection system which is connected by a double-lumen 14-French poly vinyl tube to an ultrathin flaccid polyethylene bag (maximal volume : ± 700 ml). Variations in gastric tone were measured by recording changes in the volume of air within an intragastric bag, maintained at a constant pressure, or at varying pressure levels. The barostat maintains a constant pressure (preselected) within a flaccid air-filled bag introduced into the stomach, changing the volume of air within the bag by an electronic feedback system.<br>
Thus, the barostat measures gastric motor activity (contraction or relaxation) as changes in intragastric volume (decrease or increase resp.) at a constant intragastric pressure. The barostat consists of a strain gauge linked by an electronic relay to an air injection-aspiration system. Both the strain gauge and the injection system are connected by means of double-lumen polyvinyl tube to an ultrathin polyethylene bag. A dial in the barostat allows selection of the pressure level to be maintained within the intragastric bag.<br>
Female beagle dogs, weighing 7-17 kg, were trained to stand quietly in Pavlov frames. They were implanted with a gastric cannula under general anaesthesia and aseptic precautions. After a median laparotomy, an incision was made through the gastric wall in longitudinal direction between the greater and the lesser curve, 2 cm above the nerves of Latarjet. The cannula was secured to the gastric wall by means of a double purse string suture and brought out via a stub wound at the left quadrant of the hypochondrium. Dogs were allowed a recovery period of two weeks.<br>
At the beginning of the experiment, the cannula was opened in order to remove any gastric juice or food remnants. If necessary, the stomach was cleansed with 40 to 50 ml lukewarm water. The ultrathin bag of the barostat was positioned into the fundus of the stomach through the gastric cannula. In order to ensure easy unfolding of the intragastric bag during the experiment, a volume of 150-200 ml was injected into the bag by raising the pressure to maximally 14 mm Hg (about 1.87 kPa) very briefly. This procedure was repeated twice. A stabilisation period of 1 hour was allowed.<br>
After a stabilization period of 30 minutes at an intragastric pressure of 2 mmHg (about 0.27 kPa), pressure-volume curves were constructed by increasing intragastric pressure with 2 mm Hg (0.27 kPa) steps (maximally 14 mm Hg (about 1.87 kPa)) (11 minutes at 2 mmHg (0.27 kPa) and 3 minutes at each pressure step). These changes in pressure could be set either manually or could be installed via a computer program (LabVIEW). At least 2 stable curves had to be observed before drug administration.<br>
Then, the test compound was administered subcutaneously between the first 3-5 minutes at 2 mmHg (0.27 kPa). Test compounds were screened at 0.63 mg/kg s.c. Other doses and routes were tested if a test compound was shown to be active during the screening procedure. Four new pressure-volume curves were then constructed to evaluate the effect induced by the compound. Table C-l summarizes the percentual effect on relaxation of the fundus, 1 hour after administration of the test compound.<br><br>
C.2 Vasoconstrictive activity on basilar artery<br>
Segments of basilar arteries taken from pigs (anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital) were mounted for recording of isometric tension in organ baths. The preparations were bathed in Krebs - Henseleit solution. The solution was kept at 37°C and gassed with a mixture of 95% 62 - 5% CO2- The preparations were stretched until a stable basal tension of 2 grams was obtained.<br>
The preparations were made to constrict with serotonin ( 3x10~7 M). The response to the addition of serotonin was measured and subsequently the serotonin was washed away. This procedure was repeated until stable responses were obtained. Subsequently the test compound was administered to the organ bath and the constriction of the preparation was measured. This constrictive response was expressed as a percentage of the response to serotonin as measured previously.<br>
The EDso-value (molar concentration) is defined as the concentration at which a test compound causes 50% of the constrictive response obtained with serotonin. Said EDsQ-values are estimated from experiments on three different preparations. A large number of compounds were tested. The following compounds had EDso-values higher than 1.00xlO-°6M: 1,3,6,9, 11, 13,14, 17,20,23,26,38,41,43,45,47,48,50,52, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65, 66, 67, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93,95,96, 109, 114, 115, 117, 118,119, 121, 125, 127, 128, 129, 131, 133, 137, 138, 141, 143, 147, 148, 156, 164. Compound 10 had anED50-value of l.BxlO-O^M, and compound 21 had an EDfQ-value of 5.90x10'07 M.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
