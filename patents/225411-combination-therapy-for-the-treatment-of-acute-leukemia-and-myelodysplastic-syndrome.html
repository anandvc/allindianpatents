				<td>COMBINATION THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE LEUKEMIA AND<br>
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods of treatment and pharmaceutical combinations are provided for the<br>
treatment of acute leukemia, in particular, acute myelogenous leukemia and<br>
myelodysplastic syndrome. The methods of treatment and pharmaceutical<br>
combinations employ an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate in combination with at least<br>
one compound selected from the group consisting of an anthracycline and a<br>
pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog, in particular, gemtuzumab ozogamicin,<br>
daunorubicin, and cytarabine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acute leukemia is typically a rapidly progressing leukemia characterized by<br>
replacement of normal bone marrow by blast cells of a clone arising from malignant<br>
transformation of a hematopoieVic stem cell. There are two types of acute leukemias,<br>
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). ALL is<br>
the most common malignancy in children, but also occurs in adolescents and has a<br>
second, lower peak in adults. AML, also know as acute myeloid leukemia and acute<br>
myelocytic leukemia, is the more common acute leukemia in adults and its incidence<br>
increases with age, but AML also occurs in children. For both types of acute<br>
leukemias, the primary goal of treatment is to achieve complete remission, with<br>
resolution of abnormal clinical features, return to normal blood counts and normal<br>
hematopoiesis in the bone marrow with <br>
'1,000-1,500, a platelet count of &gt;100,000, and disappearance of the leukemic clone;<br>
however, the drug regimens for treating ALL and AML have differed. The Merck<br>
Manual. Sec. 11, Ch. 138 (17th ed. 1999); Estey, E., Cancer (2001) 92(5):1059-1073.<br>
Initial therapy aims at inducing remission Treatment of AML differs most from ALL in<br>
that patients with AML respond to fewer drugs and have a high rate of relapse.<br>
Patients with AML who achieve a complete remission live longer than patients<br>
who do not, and only patients who achieve complete remission are potentially cured<br>
if their complete remission remains for at least three years. Estey, E., Cancer (2001)<br>
92(5):1059, 1060. Remission induction rates in patients with AML range from 50 to<br>
85%, with patients older than 50 years, and especially those older than 65 years, less<br>
likely to achieve remission. Long-term disease-free survival occurs in a low<br>
percentage of patients, 20-40%, and increases to 40-50% in younger patients treated<br>
with bone marrow transplants. Patients with secondary AML have a poor prognosis.<br>
The Merck Manual. Sec. 11, Ch. 138 (17th ed. 1999).<br>
Treatment of AML is problematic because normal stem-cell precursors are<br>
sensitive to the agents used, and therapy aimed at myeloid leukemic clones results in<br>
destruction of part of the normal stem-cell pool. Induction of remission is usually<br>
possible with intensive chemotherapy. Complete remission has been stated to be<br>
achievable in up io 80% of younger patients and about 50% of oider patients (who<br>
form the majority of those with AML), but patients suffer severe neutropenia during<br>
induction and remission rate is to some extent dependent upon the standard of<br>
supportive care. Remission rates are lower in those with adverse prognostic factors<br>
such as poor performance status, AML secondary to myelodysplasia or<br>
antineoplastics, high white cell count, features of multidrug resistance, and<br>
unfavorable cytogenetics. Lowenberg, B., et al., N. Engl J. Med. (1999) 341:1051-<br>
62; Correction, ibid; 1484. The greatest unmet medical need is in AML patients over<br>
70 years of age. For these elderly AML patients, complete remission may be difficult<br>
to obtain, but an increased benefit in their quality of life is a treatment goal to be<br>
achieved.<br>
Established regimens are based on cytarabine, a pyrimidine nucleoside<br>
analog, with the anthracycline daunorubicin. Lowenberg, B., et al., N. Engl. J. Med.<br>
(1999) 341:1051-62; Correction, ibid.; 1484; Burnett, A.K. &amp; Eden O.B., Lancet<br>
(1997) 349:270-275; Hiddemann, W., et al., J. Clin. Oncol. (1999) 173569-76. The<br>
first successful regimens also included thioguanine, which is still used by some<br>
medical centers, although the majority opinion is that it gives no additional advantage<br>
and thioguanine has been dropped from most induction protocols. Alternatives to<br>
daunorubicin include idarubicin and mitoxantrone. Lowenberg, B , er a/., N. Engl. J.<br>
Med. (1999) 341:1051-62; Correction, ibid.; 1484. Etoposide has been added to<br>
induction protocols of cytarabine and daunorubicin with improved results in younger<br>
patients.<br>
The basic induction regimen for treatment of AML includes administration of<br>
cytarabine by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for 7 days, with an anthracycline<br>
such as daunorubicin or idarubicin given IV for 3 days during this time, usually in the<br>
first three days. The Merck Manual. Sec. 11, Ch. 138 (17th ed.-1999). This widely<br>
used regimen for the treatment of AML is known as a 3 + 7 regimen and produces<br>
complete remission rates of 60-80%. De Nully Brown, P., et at., Leukemia (1997)<br>
11:37-41. Treatment usually results in significant myelosuppression, often for long<br>
periods before marrow recovery. Other adverse events from these two drugs include<br>
chemical arachnoiditis, myocardial toxicity, and neurotoxicity. The induction regimen<br>
may be repeated, usuaily up to a totai of three times, to achieve remission. Before<br>
repeating the induction regimen, a bone marrow analysis is done on after fourteen<br>
days from the completion of the last induction regimen. If the bone marrow has been<br>
cleaned out, i.e., there is a complete response, then the physician will wait until the<br>
patient's peripheral blood counts recover before administering another induction<br>
regimen. If the bone marrow analysis shows that disease is still present, i.e., there is<br>
a partial or minimal response, then the induction regimen will be repeated without<br>
waiting for the patient's peripheral blood counts to recover. The waiting period<br>
between induction regimens is therefore twenty-eight to thirty-five days for a<br>
complete responder, and fourteen to twenty-one days for partial and minimal<br>
responders. For patients with relapsed AML, the standard induction therapy of<br>
cytarabine and daunorubicin does not produce a good response rate, typically 
and the prognosis is poor for these patients.<br>
After remission is achieved, a second treatment regimen using the same<br>
drugs or other drugs to knock out the disease, known as consolidation therapy, may<br>
be employed. However, a high percentage of patients suffer from relapse, even in<br>
series with intensive post-remission consolidation chemotherapy. De Nully Brown,<br>
P., et al., Leukemia (1997) 11:37-41<br>
The current trend is towards the use of more intensive induction regimens.<br>
Use of high-dose cytarabine in doses of up to 3 g/m2 every twelve hours for up to six<br>
days per day (with daunorubicin and etoposide) has been reported to improve the<br>
duration of first remission and disease-free survival compared with standard doses of<br>
cytarabine. Bishop, J.F., et al., Blood (1996) 87:1710-1717. Equally the timing of<br>
induction cycles may be important: intensive timing (where the second cycle was<br>
given 10 days after the first) has improved disease-free survival, despite more<br>
toxicity-related deaths, compared with the standard interval of 14 clays or more.<br>
Woods, W.G., et al., Blood (1996) 87:4979-4989.<br>
Once remission is induced, further treatment (post remission -therapy) is<br>
essential in preventing relapse. Lowenberg, B., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (1999)<br>
341:1051-62; Correction, ibid.; 1484; Burnett, A.K. &amp; Eden O.B., Lancet (1997)<br>
349:270-275; Hiddemann, W., et al., J. Clin. Oncol. (1999) 17:3569-76. Options<br>
include further chemotherapy, or allogeneic or autologous bone marrow<br>
transplantation. Long-term survival of about 50% may be possible with these options<br>
when used in patients in first remission. However, which option to use is<br>
controversial. The most successful chemotherapy regimens use high-dose<br>
cytarabine for up to 4 courses, and appear to be comparable to bone marrow<br>
transplantation in terms of survival. Mayer, R.J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (1994)<br>
331:896-903; Cassileth, PA, et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (1998) 339:1649-1656.<br>
Consequently, some advocate a policy of intensive post remission chemotherapy,<br>
reserving transplantation for subsequent relapse, particularly for patients with<br>
favorable cytogenetics. Edenfield, W.J. &amp; Gore, S.D., Semin. Oncol. (1999) 26:21-<br>
34.<br>
Another drug used in the treatment of AML is gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
(Mylotarg®). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was approved in May 2000 in the United<br>
States of America for the treatment of AML in patients in first relapse who are 60<br>
years old or older and not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is administered as a two-hour IV infusion in a dose of 9<br>
mg/m2 . A second dose may be administered fourteen days later. While many<br>
. patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin have achieved complete remission, a<br>
significant number of patients have had a delay in platelet recovery or incomplete<br>
platelet recovery. Physician's Desk Reference (56th ed. 2002). Hepatic<br>
venoocclusive disease (VOD), which is potentially fatal, has occurred in patients who<br>
have undergone stem cell transplantation after gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy.<br>
Tack, D.K. et a!., Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001) 28(9):895-897. It was also<br>
reported in July 2001 that patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin who did not<br>
undergo stem cell transplantation developed as much as a 10% increased risk of<br>
developing significant hepatotoxicity and possible morbidity and mortality, although<br>
most of these patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin in previously untested<br>
combinations or outside the approved labeled use. Giles, F.J., et al., Cancer (2001)<br>
92(2):406-413. Like the standard cytarabine-daunorubicin induction therapy, the<br>
response rate of patients with relapsed AML to gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy can<br>
be 
Combination therapies with gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been tried with<br>
limited success. In one study, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered to elderly<br>
patients previously untreated for AML by 2-hour IV infusion at a dose of 9 mg/m2 on<br>
day 1 and 15, with MICE (mitoxantrone, cytarabine and etoposide) being given for<br>
one or two courses within seven days from the response assessment to gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin (between day 28 and 35 following the last infusion). Significant non-<br>
hematologic adverse events included, among others, VOD (6%), arrhythmia (6%),<br>
and infection (24%). At the end of the whole induction program, thirteen patients<br>
were in complete remission (38.2%) and 3 achieved a complete remission with<br>
incomplete platelet recovery (8.8%) for an overall response rate of 47%, not an<br>
improvement over existing therapies for AML. Amadori, S., et al., "Sequential<br>
Administration of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) and Intensive Chemotherapy for<br>
Remission Induction in Previously Untreated Patients with AML over the Age of 60:<br>
Interim Results of the EORTC Leukemia Group AML-15A Phase II Trial," Blood<br>
(2001) 98:587a.<br>
In another study, patients with poor prognosis AML (&gt;70 years age,<br>
myelodysplasia, leukemia developing after toxic exposure) were either treated under<br>
a protocol designated "AML 9503" in which the patient received two "pulses" of<br>
chemotherapy each consisting of 2 gm/m2 of cytarabine (a high dose of cytarabine)<br>
administered at time=0 and time=12 hours and mitoxantrone in an amount of 35<br>
mg/m2 immediately after the second cytarabine dose, with the second "pulse" being<br>
given 96 hours later, or were treated under a protocol designated "AML 9798" in<br>
which the patient received two "pulses" of chemotherapy each consisting of 2 gm/m2<br>
of cytarabine administered at time=0 and time=12 hours and mitoxantrone in an<br>
amount of 35 mg/m2 immediately after the second cytarabine dose, with the second<br>
"pulse" being given 96 hours later, followed by administration of amifostine. The<br>
complete remission rate for AML 9503 was 30% and for AML 9798 was 40%. When<br>
the chemotherapy was changed to add a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in<br>
an amount of 9 mg/m2 three days prior to the first pulse of chemotherapy, two of four<br>
such treated patients with refractory AML entered complete remission. Preisler,<br>
H,.D., et al., "Synergistic Antileukemia Effects of Mylotarg and Chemotherapy in<br>
AML," Blood (2001) 98:193b.<br>
In a feasibility study, patients 
(daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 days 1, 3, 5; cytarabine 400 mg/m2 bd days 1-10;<br>
thioguanine 100 mg/m2 bd days 1-10) with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 or 6 mg/m2<br>
given as a 2-hour infusion on day 1). The second course given was H-DAT 3+8 with<br>
the same gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose as in course 1. While both the 3 mg/m2 and<br>
6 mg/m2 doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were tolerated in these two regimens,<br>
increased liver toxicity was seen when gemtuzumab ozogamicin was given at 6<br>
mg/m2 in the first course and it was decided to thereafter use 3 mg/m2 of<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin in courses 1 and 2. Kell, J.W., et al., "Effects of Mylotarg™<br>
(Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, GO) in Combination with Standard Induction<br>
Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML): A Feasibility<br>
Study," Blood (2001) 98:123a-124a.<br>
In a further study, patients 
(daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 daily by slow IV push on days 1, 3, 5; cytarabine 200 mg/m2<br>
IV push bd days 1-10; thioguanine 100 mg/m2 bd oral days 1-10) or S-DAT 3+10<br>
(daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 daily by slow IV push on days 1, 3, 5; cytarabine 100 mg/m2<br>
IV push bd days 1-10; thioguanine 100 mg/m2 bd oral days 1-10) with 3 or 6 mg/m2<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin as induction therapy. A second course of H-DAT 3+8<br>
(daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 daily by slow IV push on days 1, 3, 5; cytarabine 200 mg/m2<br>
IV push bd days 1-8; thioguanine 100 mg/m2 bd oral days 1-10) or S-DAT 3+8<br>
(daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 daily by slow IV push on days 1, 3, 5; cytarabine 100 mg/m2<br>
IV push bd days 1-8; thioguanine 100 mg/m2 bd oral days 1-10) was given with or<br>
without gemtuzumab ozogamicin in an amount of 3 mg/m2. Consolidation therapy<br>
consisted of MACE (MACE: Amsacarine 100 mg/m2 daily by one hour infusion (in 5%<br>
dextrose on days 1-5); cytarabine 200 mg/m2 by daily continuous IV infusion days 1-<br>
5, Etoposide 100 mg/m2 daily by one hour IV infusion days 1-5) chemotherapy with or<br>
without gemtuzumab ozogamicin in an amount of 3 mg/m2. Patients who received<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin in courses 1 and 2 had delayed hematological recovery<br>
and VOD, one of whom died. The 6 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was<br>
also associated with increased liver toxicity. It was concluded that 3 mg/m2<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin can be given with H-DAT 3+10 in course 1 and in course 3<br>
with MACE, but that two courses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in induction or an<br>
increase of the dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to 6 mg/m2 is associated with<br>
increased toxicity and not recommended. Burnett, A.K. and Kell, J., "The Feasibility<br>
of Combining Immunoconjugate and Chemotherapy in AML," Hematology J. (June<br>
2002) Vol. 3, supp. 1, p. 156.<br>
In another preliminary study to assess safety and efficacy, gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin was given to de novo and relapsed/refractory AML patients &gt;60 years old<br>
in a combination therapy with cytarabine. Six patients were treated with cytarabine<br>
by continuous infusion in an amount of 100 mg/m2/day on days 1 to 7 and<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin in an amount of 6 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15. While the<br>
combination was well tolerated, four patients died. To reduce the duration of<br>
myelosuppression following induction therapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was<br>
administered on days 1 and 8 in an amount of 6 mg/m2 on day 1 and 4 mg/m2 on day<br>
8. Of seven patients who were treated, three achieved complete remission. Durrant,<br>
S., et al., Proc. Amer. Soc. Clin. Oncol. (2002) 21:271a.<br>
To assess the safety and efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as part of<br>
combination therapy for AML, a phase l/ll study was developed in the United States<br>
of America combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with cytarabine and daunorubicin.<br>
The phase I portion of the study began in October 2000 and a preliminary report was<br>
published at the 43* American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting electronically<br>
on November 6, 2001 and in print on November 7, 2001. DeAngelo, D., et al.,<br>
"Preliminary Report of the Safety and Efficacy of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin<br>
(Mylotarg®) Given in Combination with Cytarabine and Daunorubicin in Patients with<br>
Acute Myeloid Leukemia", Blood (2001) 98:199(b). That report described the<br>
treatment of three patients, one with de novo AML and two with relapsed/refractory<br>
AML, with cytarabine in an amount of 100 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on days<br>
1 to 7, daunorubicin In an amount of 45 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3, and gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin in an amount of 6 mg/m2 on day 4 (dosage group 1). The combination<br>
was well tolerated, no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, and two patients<br>
achieved a remission. Three patients with relapsed/refractory AML then were<br>
enrolled in the next dosage group in which the dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was<br>
escalated to 9 mg/m2 (dosage group 2), with the combination well tolerated, but all<br>
three patients were nonresponders. Six additional patients, three with de novo AML<br>
and three with relapsed/refractory AML, were enrolled at the dosage level of 9<br>
mg/m2. Therapy was again well tolerated, and no DLT was observed. There were,<br>
however, 2 episodes of grade 3 non-drug-related elevations of ALT/AST and 2<br>
episodes of grade 4 non-drug-related dyspnea. All 3 patients with de novo AML<br>
achieved remission and recovered both an ANC &gt; 1500/mL and platelets &gt;<br>
100,000/mL on days 26, 28, and 36, respectively. Patients then were enrolled in the<br>
next dosage group in which the cytarabine dose was increased to 200 mg/m2/day<br>
(dosage group 3). Infusion of the combination therapy was well tolerated, but DLT<br>
was observed in four of six patients enrolled in this group with one patient with<br>
refractory AML developing hepatic VOD soon after completing induction therapy and<br>
dying on day 28. Another patient with de novo AML died of cardiac arrest on day 24<br>
and also had reversible grade 3 elevation of ALT. In light of the foregoing results, it<br>
was concluded that six additional patients would be enrolled in dosage group 1 to<br>
expand the safety data, and if the combination of cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day,<br>
daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 would be found to be<br>
well tolerated in this expanded group, then the phase It portion of the study would<br>
begin and approximately 45 patients with de novo AML would be enrolled.<br>
DeAngelo, D., et al., supra. The efficacy of the combination of cytarabine 100<br>
mg/m2/day, daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 could not<br>
be determined based on the limited number of patients enrolled in the phase I portion<br>
of the study or the efficacy of this combination compared to the efficacy of standard<br>
chemotherapy for AML.<br>
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of syndromes (preleukemia,<br>
refractory anemias, Ph-negative chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic<br>
myelomonocytic leukemia, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) commonly seen in<br>
patients &gt; 50 years old. its incidence is unknown, but it is increasing, probably in<br>
part due to the increasing proportion of elderly in the population and an increase in<br>
treatment-associated leukemias. Exposure to benzene and radiation may be related<br>
to its development. In the preleukemic phase of some of the secondary Ieukemias<br>
(e g., after drug or toxic exposure), altered and defective cellular production may be<br>
seen with diagnostic features of myelodysplasia. The Merck Manual. Sec. 11, Ch.<br>
138 (17th ed. 1999).<br>
MDS is characterized by clonal proliferation of hematopoietic cells, including<br>
erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic forms. The bone marrow is normal or<br>
hypercellular, and ineffective hematopoiesis causes variable cytopenias, the most<br>
frequent being anemia. The disordered cell production is also associated with<br>
morphologic cellular abnormalities in marrow and blood. Extramedullary<br>
hematopoiesis may occur, leading to hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.<br>
Myelofibrosis is occasionally present at diagnosis or may develop during the course<br>
of MDS. The MDS clone is unstable and tends to progress to AML. The prognosis<br>
of a patient with MDS is highly dependent on FAB classification and on any<br>
associated disease. Patients with refractory anemia or refractory anemia with<br>
sideroblasts are less likely to progress to the more aggressive forms and may die of<br>
unrelated causes. The Merck Manual. Sec 11, Ch. 138 (17th ed. 1999)<br>
There is no established treatment for MDS. Therapy is supportive with RBC<br>
transfusions, platelet transfusions for bleeding, and antibiotic therapy for infection. In<br>
some patients, cytokine therapy (erythropoietin to support red blood center needs,<br>
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to manage severe symptomatic<br>
granulocytopenia, and, when available, thrombopoietin for severe thrombocytopenia)<br>
can serve as important hematopoietic support. Allogeneic bone marrow<br>
transplantation is not recommended for patients &gt; 50 years old. Colony-stimulating<br>
factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-<br>
stimulating factor) increase neutrophil counts, and erythropoietin increases RBC<br>
production in 20 to 25% of cases, but survival advantage has not been shown.<br>
Response of MDS to AML chemotherapy is similar to that of AML, after age and<br>
karyotype are considered. The Merck Manual. Sec. 11, Ch. 138 (17lh ed. 1999).<br>
Thus, there is a need for an improved treatment for patients with acute<br>
leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome which will produce a higher rate of complete<br>
remission, thereby increasing the survival prospects of such patients, it has been<br>
surprisingly been found that a combination therapy employing an anti-CD33 cytotoxic<br>
conjugate in combination with an anthracycline and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside<br>
analog, in particular, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, daunorubicin, and cytarabine,<br>
respectively, a significant improvement in efficacy compared to the combination<br>
therapy of daunorubicin and cytarabine or to gemtuzumab ozogamicin alone.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides advantageous pharmaceutical combinations and<br>
methods of treatment for acute leukemia, such as AML, and for myelodysplastic<br>
syndrome (MDS) which employ an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate, an anthracycline,<br>
and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog. The method of treatments and<br>
pharmaceutical combinations described herein provide a better rate of complete<br>
remission and improved quality of life in such patients than the standard 3 + 7<br>
regimen of daunorubicin and cytarabine. Surprisingly, a preferred embodiment<br>
employing gemtuzumab ozogamicin, daunorubicin, and cytarabine provides a higher<br>
rate of complete remission than the standard 3 + 7 regimen of daunorubicin and<br>
cytarabine.<br>
The patients to be treated with the methods of treatment and pharmaceutical<br>
combinations provided herein are those who have been untreated for acute leukemia<br>
such as AML and are being treated de novo, those who are being treated with<br>
induction therapy, those who are being treated with consolidation therapy, those who<br>
are being treated after one or more relapses, and those who have MDS.<br>
One composition used in the present invention is an anti-GD33 cytotoxic<br>
conjugate in which an anti-CD33 antibody is conjugated with a cytotoxic antitumor or<br>
antibiotic, such as a calicheamicin isolated from fermentation of a bacterium,<br>
Micromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis, or an esperamicin. Calicheamicins<br>
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,970,198; 5,037,651; and 5,079,233.<br>
Esperamicins are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,675,187; 4,539,203; 4,554,162;<br>
 and 4,837,206. The antibody portion of the conjugate binds specifically to the CD33<br>
antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of leukemic<br>
blasts and immature normal cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal<br>
hematopoietic stem cells, and acts as a targeting unit to deliver the cytotoxic agent to<br>
these targeted cells. This antibody is linked to the calicheamicin or esperamicin.<br>
When N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin is used, it is preferred to link the antibody by a<br>
bifunctional linker. Such conjugates and methods for making them are described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,733,001; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,877,296; 5,606,040; 5,712,374;<br>
and 5,714,586, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
A preferred form of the anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate for use in the present<br>
invention is gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a chemotherapy agent composed of a<br>
recombinant humanized lgG4, kappa antibody conjugated with calicheamicin.<br>
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is available commercially as Mylotarg® (Wyeth<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA). The antibody portion of gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin binds specifically to the CD33 antigen. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
contains amino acid sequences of which approximately 98.3% are of human origin.<br>
The constant region and framework regions contain human sequences while the<br>
complementarity-determining regions are derived from a murine antibody (p67.6) that<br>
binds CD33. This antibody is linked to N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin via a<br>
bifunctional linker. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has approximately 50% of the antibody<br>
loaded with 4-6 moles calicheamicin per mole of antibody. The remaining 50% of the<br>
antibody is not linked to the calicheamicin derivative. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has a<br>
molecular weight of 151 to 153 kDa. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin and methods for<br>
making it are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,733,001; 5,739,116; 5,767,285;<br>
5,877,296; 5,606,040; 5,712,374; and 5,714,586, which are incorporated by<br>
reference herein in their entirety. When given as a single agent therapy for the<br>
treatment of AML, the recommended dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is 9 mg/m2,<br>
administered as a two-hour intravenous infusion. The recommended treatment<br>
course with gemtuzumab ozogamicin alone has been a total of two doses with<br>
fourteen days between the doses. In the combination therapy of the present<br>
invention, gemtuzumab ozogamicin is given in an amount ranging from about 3<br>
mg/m2 to 9 mg/m2 per day.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,773,001, in col. 62, lines 37-46, and Example 112,<br>
describes dosage amounts of calicheamicin conjugates, including gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin, based on calicheamicin equivalents, i.e., 10 ug calicheamicin/m2 protein,<br>
as compared to the clinical dose description based on mg/m2 body-surface. When<br>
calicheamicin is loaded onto the antibody, there is approximately 27 ug<br>
calicheamicin/mg protein. A 9 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is equivalent<br>
to 243 ug calicheamicin/m2 protein. A 6 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is<br>
equivalent to 162 ug calicheamicin/m2 protein. A 3 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin is equivalent to 81 ug calicheamicin/m2 protein.<br>
Another composition used in the present invention is an anthracycline, an<br>
anticancer agent consisting of 3 moieties: a pigmented aglycone, an amino sugar,<br>
and a lateral chain. Anthracyclines include doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin,<br>
aclarubicin, zorubicin, mitoxantrone, epirubicin, carubicin, nogalamycin, menogaril,<br>
pitarubicin, and valrubicin. See Merck Index (13th ed. 2001).<br>
A preferred anthracycline for use in the present invention is daunorubicin.<br>
Daunorubicin, also known as daunomycin, is an anthracycline cytotoxic antibiotic of<br>
the rhodomycin group obtained from Streptomyces peucetius, which is used in the<br>
treatment of acute leukemia. Stedman's Medical Dictionary (27th ed. 2002).<br>
Daunorubicin has a 4-ring anthracycline moiety linked by a glycosidic bond to<br>
daunosamine, an amino sugar. Daunorubicin may also be isolated from<br>
Streptomyces coeruleorubidus and has the following chemical name: (8S- cis )-8-<br>
acetyl-10-[ (3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-(alpha)-L- lyxo -hexopyranosyl) oxy]-7,8,9,10-<br>
tetrahydro-6,8,11 -trihydroxy-1 -methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione hydrochloride.<br>
Daunorubicin is usually given as the hydrochloride, but doses are expressed in terms<br>
of the base.<br>
A preferred form of daunorubicin used in the present invention is daunorubicin<br>
hydrochloride, the hydrochloride salt of daunorubicin. Daunorubicin hydrochloride is<br>
available commercially as Cerubidine® (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford Ohio). It may<br>
be described with the chemical name of (1 S ,3 S )-3-Acetyl-1,2,3,4,6,11-hexahydro-<br>
3,5,12-trihydroxy-10-methoxy-6,11-dioxo-1-naphthacenyl 3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-<br>
(alpha)-L- lyxo -hexopyranoside hydrochloride. Its molecular formula is C 27 H 29 NO<br>
10 .HCI with a molecular weight of 563.99. !n the treatment of adult acute<br>
nonlymphocytic leukemia, such as AML and ALL, daunorubicin hydrochloride, used<br>
as a single agent, has produced complete remission rates of 40 to 50%, and in<br>
combination with cytarabine, has produced complete remission rates of 53 to 65%.<br>
Physician's Desk Reference (56th ed. 2002). Typically, daunorubicin is given daily for<br>
three days in an amount of 30 to 45 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion for two to three<br>
days. In high-dose regimens, daunorubicin is given daily in an amount of 50 mg/m2<br>
for three days.<br>
Daunorubicin is also available commercially in a daunorubicin citrate<br>
liposome injection as DaunoXome® (Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA).<br>
DaunoXome® contains an aqueous solution of the citrate salt of daunorubicin<br>
encapsulated within lipid vesicles (liposomes) composed of a lipid bilayer of<br>
distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (2:1 molar ratio), with a mean diameter<br>
of about 45 nm. The lipid to drug weight ratio is 18.7:1 (total lipid:daunorubicin base),<br>
equivalent to a 10:5:1 molar ratio of distearoylphosphatidylcholine: cholesterol:<br>
daunorubicin. Each vial of DaunoXome® contains daunorubicin citrate equivalent to<br>
50 mg of daunorubicin base, encapsulated in liposomes consisting of 704 mg<br>
distearoylphosphatidylcholine and 168 mg cholesterol. The liposomes encapsulating<br>
daunorubicin are dispersed in an aqueous medium containing 2,125 mg sucrose, 94<br>
mg glycine, and 7 mg calcium chloride dihydrate in a total volume of 25 ml/vial. The<br>
pH of the dispersion is between 4.9 and 6.0. DaunoXome® is administered<br>
intravenously over a 60 minute period at a dose of 40 mg/m2. with doses repeated<br>
every two weeks.<br>
A third composition used in the present invention is a pyrimidine nucleoside<br>
analog or a purine nucleoside analog. Representative of such nucleoside analogs<br>
are cytarabine, gemcitabine, trifluridine, ancitabine, enocitabine, azacitidine,<br>
doxifluridine, pentostatin, broxuridine, capecitabine, cladribine, decitabine,<br>
floxuridine, fludarabine, gougerotin, puromycin, tegafur, tiazofurin, and tubercidin.<br>
See Merck Index (13th ed. 2001).<br>
A preferred pyrimidine nucleoside analog used in the present invention is<br>
cytarabine, which is also known as arabinosylcytosine (aC, araC), arabinocytidine, or<br>
arabinofuranosylcytosine. Chemically, cytarabine is 4-amino-1-(beta)-D-<br>
arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone, also known as cytosine arabinoside (C 9H 13N<br>
3 O 5 , molecular weight 243.22). Cytarabine is a cell cycle phase-specific<br>
antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of cell division. It is a<br>
compound of arabinose and cytosine that inhibits the biosynthesis of DNA and is<br>
used as a chemotherapeutic agent because of its antiviral and tumor-growth-<br>
inhibiting properties. Typically, cytarabine is given in an amount of 100-200 mg/m2<br>
daily for five to ten days by constant intravenous infusion, usually for seven days.<br>
Cytarabine can be given in an amount of 100 mg/m2 body-surface twice daily by<br>
rapid intravenous injection. However, cytarabine can be given in amounts of up to 3<br>
g/m2 daily. In high-dose regimens, cytarabine is given in doses of up to 3 g/m2 by<br>
intravenous infusion for every 12 hours for up to six days.<br>
Cytarabine is also available commercially in a cytarabine liposome injection<br>
as DEPOCYT® (Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA). DepoCyt® is a sterile,<br>
injectable suspension of the antimetabolite cytarabine, encapsulated into<br>
multivesicular lipid-based particles. Each vial contains 50 mg of cytarabine.<br>
Cytarabine, the active ingredient, is present at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and is<br>
encapsulated in the particles. Inactive ingredients at their respective approximate<br>
concentrations are cholesterol, 4.1 mg/ml; triolein, 1.2 mg/ml;<br>
dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 5.7 mg/ml; and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol<br>
(DPPG), 1.0 mg/ml. The pH of the product falls within the range from 5.5 to 8.5.<br>
DepoCyt® is administered intrathecally.<br>
The present invention provides several methods for treating acute leukemia<br>
or MDS. In one method, a patient is given an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate in<br>
combination with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an<br>
anthracycline and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog in an amount effective to<br>
ameliorate the symptoms of the acute leukemia, such as AML, or MDS. Preferably,<br>
the cytotoxin in the anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate is a calicheamicin or an<br>
esperamicin. The anthracycline is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
doxorubicin, daunorubidn, idarubicin, aclarubicin, zorubicin, mitoxantrone, epirubicin,<br>
carubicin, nogalamycin, menogaril, pitarubicin, and valrubicin. The pyrimidine or<br>

The nature of acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome calls for the<br>
administration of intensive chemotherapy to induce remission in patients having<br>
these diseases. In one embodiment of the present invention, a single course of<br>
combination therapy comprises administering to the patient a therapeufically effective<br>
amount of an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate, together with one or more<br>
chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracycline, and a pyrimidine or purine<br>
nucleoside analog. The present invention also provides treatment regimens in which<br>
multiple courses of combination therapy, which include an anti-CD33 cytotoxic<br>
conjugate and other chemotherapeutic agents, are administered. Such treatment<br>
regimens may be administered from at least two to five courses of treatment,<br>
depending upon the drugs being administered, the severity of the disease, and the<br>
condition of the patient.<br>
In another method of treatment of the present invention, a patient having<br>
acute leukemia or MDS is given three courses of therapy. In the first course of<br>
therapy, the patient is given an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate for one day; an<br>
anthracycline for up to three days; and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog for<br>
up to ten days. The cytotoxin in the anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate may be selected<br>
from the group consisting of a calicheamicin and an esperamicin. The anthracycline<br>
may be selected from the group consisting of doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin,<br>
aclarubidn, zorubicin, mitoxantrone, epirubicin, carubicin, nogalamycin, menogaril,<br>
pitarubicin, and valrubicin. The pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog may be<br>
selected from the group consisting of cytarabine, gemcitabine, trifluridine, ancitabine,<br>
enocitabine, azacitidine, doxifluridine, pentostatin, broxuridine, capecitabine,<br>
cladribine, decitabine, floxuridine, fludarabine, gougerotin, puromycin, tegafur,<br>
tiazofurin, and tubercidin. The first course of therapy is repeated as a second course<br>
of therapy in which the patient is given an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate for one day,<br>
an anthracycline for up to three days, and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog<br>
for up to ten days. A third course of therapy may be given to the patient which<br>
comprises the administration to the patient of an anthracycline selected from the<br>
group consisting of doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, aclarubicin, zorubicin,<br>
mitoxantrone, epirubicin, carubicin, nogalamycin, menogaril, pitarubicin, and<br>
valrubicin for up to three days, and a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog selected<br>
from the group consisting of cytarabine, gemcitabine, trifluridine, ancitabine,<br>
enocitabine, azacitidine, doxifluridine, pentostatin, broxuridine, capecitabine,<br>
cladribine, decitabine, floxuridine, fludarabine, gougerotin, puromycin, tegafur,<br>
tiazofurin, and tubercidin for up to ten days.<br>
In another such method of treatment of acute leukemia or MDS, a patient is<br>
given a first course of therapy comprising gemtuzumab ozogamicin in an amount of<br>
about 3 mg/m2 to about 9 mg/m2, preferably 6 mg/m2, per day for one day;<br>
daunorubicin in an amount of about 45 mg/m2 to about 60 mg/m2, preferably 45<br>
mg/m2, per day for up to three days; and cytarabine in an amount of about 100<br>
mg/m2 to about 200 mg/m2, preferably 100 mg/m2, per day for up to ten days. A<br>
second course of therapy is given to the patient comprising gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
in an amount of about 3 mg/m2 to about 9 mg/m2, preferably 6 mg/m2, per day for one<br>
day; daunorubicin in an amount of about 45 mg/m2 to about 60 mg/m2, preferably 45<br>
mg/m2, per day for up to three- days; and cytarabine in an amount of about 100<br>
mg/m2 to about 200 mg/m2, preferably 100 mg/m2, per day for up to ten days. A third<br>
course of therapy may be administered to the patient comprising daunorubicin in an<br>
amount of about 45 mg/m2 to about 60 mg/m2, preferably 45 mg/m2, per day for up to<br>
three days, and cytarabine in an amount of about 100 mg/m2 to about 200 mg/m2,<br>
preferably 100 mg/m2, per day for up to ten days.<br>
The surprising and unexpected result disclosed herein is the ability of the anti-<br>
CD33 cytotoxic conjugate, the anthracycline, and the pyrimidine or purine nucleoside<br>
analog to act synergistically in the treatment of various symptoms associated with<br>
acute leukemia or MDS. Synergistically" is used herein to refer to a situation where<br>
the benefit conveyed by the administration of these antineoplastic compositions in<br>
combination is greater than the algebraic sum of the effects resulting from the<br>
separate administration of the components of the combination. As shown in the<br>
Examples below, the combination treatment of an anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate, an<br>
anthracycline, and an pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analog is synergistic with<br>
respect to treating acute leukemia and increasing the efficacy as measured by<br>
complete remission. This combined treatment has the advantage of achieving the<br>
same result with a lower dose of the anti-CD33 cytotoxic conjugate, thereby reducing<br>
any toxic effect from the conjugate, providing an improved quality of life, and<br>
increasing the chances for survival of the patient.<br>
As with the use of other chemotherapeutic drugs, the individual patient will be<br>
monitored in a manner deemed appropriate by the treating physician. The<br>
combination therapy agents described herein may be administered with<br>
immunosuppressive agents, potentiators and side-effect relieving agents as deemed<br>
necessary by the treating physician.<br>
In therapeutic applications, the dosages of the agents used in accordance<br>
with the invention may vary depending on the agent, the age, weight, and clinical<br>
condition of the recipient patient, and the experience and judgment of the clinician or<br>
practitioner administering the therapy, among other factors affecting the selected<br>
dosage. Generally, the dose should be sufficient to result in complete remission as<br>
previously defined. An effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent is that which<br>
provides an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other<br>
qualified observer. It is especially advantageous to formulate compositions of these<br>
antineoplastic compounds in dosage unit form for ease of administration and<br>
uniformity of dosage. "Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to physically discrete<br>
units suited as unitary dosages for the patients to be treated, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of anti-neoplastic compounds calculated to produce the<br>
desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. As<br>
used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coating, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and<br>
absorption delaying agents and the like which are compatible with the active<br>
ingredient and with the mode of administration and other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention which are found in the<br>
combination may also include, depending on the formulation desired,<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are defined as<br>
vehicles commonly used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for animal or<br>
human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological<br>
activity of the combination. Examples of such diluents are distilled water,<br>
physiological saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution. In<br>
addition, the pharmaceutical composition or formulation may also include other<br>
carriers, adjuvants, or nontoxic, nontherapeutic, nonimmunogenic stabilizers and the<br>
like. Effective amounts of such diluent or carrier will be those amounts which are<br>
effective to obtain a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation in terms of solubility of<br>
components, or biological activity, and the like.<br>
For parenteral therapeutic administration, each antineoplastic compound may<br>
be incorporated with a sterile injectable solution. The sterile injectable solution may<br>
be prepared by incorporating the antineoplastic compound in the required amount in<br>
an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, with various other ingredients,<br>
followed by filtered sterilization. In the case of dispersions, each may be prepared by<br>
incorporating the additional antineoplastic compound into a sterile vehicle which<br>
contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those<br>
enumerated herein. In the case of sterile injectable solutions, each may be prepared<br>
by incorporating a powder of the additional antineoplastic compound and, optionally,<br>
any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof,<br>
wherein the powder is prepared by any suitable technique (e.g., vacuum drying and<br>
freeze drying). The use of such media and agents is well known in the art (see for<br>
example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990), Mack Publishing<br>
Co., Easton, PA 18042, pages 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference). Supplementary active ingredients can also be<br>
incorporated into the compositions. The specific dose of the antineoplastic<br>
compound is calculated according to the approximate body weight or surface area of<br>
the patient. Other factors in determining the appropriate dosage can include the<br>
stage of the acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (de novo or<br>
relapse), the severity of the disease, the route of administration and the age, sex and<br>
medical condition of the patient. Further refinement of the calculations necessary to<br>
determine the appropriate dosage for treatment involving each of the<br>
herein-mentioned formulations is routinely made by those skilled in the art. Dosages<br>
can also be determined through the use of known assays for determining dosages<br>
used in conjunction with appropriate dose-response data. Thus, for example, it is<br>
within the scope of the invention that doses of the antineoplastic compounds used in<br>
the present invention for treating acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic<br>
syndrome can be varied to achieve a desired therapeutic effect.<br>
If oral therapeutic administration is an option, the antineoplastic compound<br>
may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal<br>
tablets, troches, capsules, elixers, suspensions, syrups, wafers and the like, or it may<br>
be incorporated directly with the food in the diet. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules<br>
and the like may also contain the following: a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia,<br>
corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent<br>
such as corn starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium<br>
stearate; a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin; or a flavoring<br>
agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry or orange flavoring. When the<br>
dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to material of the type<br>
described herein, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as a<br>
coating or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance,<br>
tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. 'Of course, any<br>
material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure<br>
and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the antineoplastic<br>
compound may be incorporated into a sustained-release preparation and formulation.<br>
The amount of the antineoplastic compound in such therapeutically useful<br>
composition is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
It is understood that the foregoing detailed description and the following<br>
examples are illustrative only and are not to be taken as limitations upon the scope of<br>
the invention. Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments,<br>
which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, may be made without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the present invention. Further, all patents, patent applications,<br>
and publications cited herein are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
To assess the safety and efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as part of a<br>
combination therapy for AML, a phase 1/2 study was developed in the United States<br>
of America to combine gemtuzumab ozogamicin with cytarabine and daunorubicin.<br>
Patients with relapsed, refractory, or de novo AML were enrolled in phase 1 from<br>
October 2000 through November 2001. The maximum tolerated dose was<br>
determined to be cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on days 1<br>
through 7, daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 by intravenous bolus on days 1 through 3, and<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 by 2-hour infusion on day 4. The phase 2 portion<br>
of the study was open to enrollment on November 2001 and 42 of the planned 45<br>
patients have been enrolled to date.<br>
A detailed safety and efficacy evaluation was performed on the first 19<br>
patients treated with this combination induction regimen and subsequently followed<br>
for at least 28 days. There were sixteen men and three women enrolled with a<br>
median age of 46 years (range, 20 to 60). One, ten, and three patients were<br>
categorized in favorable-, intermediate- and poor-risk cytogenetic groups,<br>
respectively. Cytogenetic analysis was not available for five patients. Seventeen<br>
patients had baseline bone marrow leukemic blast cell determinations with a median<br>
blast percentage of 60% . Combination therapy was well tolerated and all nineteen<br>
patients completed the planned induction therapy.<br>
Three patients (16%) reported NCI grade 3 fever/chills on the day of<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin infusion. The incidence of grade 3 AST/ALT elevation was<br>
16%; no grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia was reported. There were no cases of<br>
hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The incidence of<br>
grade 3 or 4 infections was 32%. The early treatment mortality rate was 0%. Four<br>
patients required re-induction for residual AML with cytarabine and daunorubicin on<br>
approximately day 15. One of these patients was taken off study and given re-<br>
induction with a high-dose cytarabine (HDAC)-containing regimen on study day 15<br>
and was not evaluable for efficacy.<br>
Fifteen of 18 patients (83%) achieved a complete remission (CR)<br>
characterized by the absence of AML blasts from the peripheral blood, no<br>
extramedullary AML, = 5% marrow blasts in a marrow with &gt;20% cellularity, and<br>
recovery of peripheral counts to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) = 1500/mL and<br>
platelets to = 100,000/mL. No patients were reported to have complete remission with<br>
incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Of the three non-remission patients, 2 had<br>
progressive disease and 1 achieved a marrow remission but required radiation<br>
therapy for a residual chloroma. Among CR patients, the median time to recover<br>
ANC to =1500/mL was 38 days and platelets to = 100,000/mL was 30 days. Patients<br>
have been followed for too short a time to determine duration of remission (median<br>
follow-up 193 days).<br>
The combination of cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day, daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, and<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 was well tolerated with low hepatotoxicity and<br>
resulted in an increase in the CR rate to 83%. Historical control data from the<br>
Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) shows a 60% CR rate with standard therapy of<br>
100 mg/m2/day of cytarabine for seven days and 45 mg/m2 of daunorubicin for three<br>
days. The combination of cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day, daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, and<br>
gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 resulted in a markedly improved rate of CR<br>
compared to standard therapy.<br>
Example 2<br>
The feasibility of combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with intensive<br>
chemotherapy for induction and/or consolidation was evaluated in 67 patients in a<br>
safety study in the United Kingdom prior to the start of the Medical Research Center<br>
AML15 trial. The aim was to combine gemtuzumab ozogamicin with chemotherapy<br>
planned in the trial, (DAT; Daunorubicin, AraC, Thioguanine, or DA; Daunorubicin<br>
AraC; or FLAG-IDA; Rludarabine, AraC, G-CSF, ldarubicin) as course 1. Course 1<br>
was given using gemtuzumab ozogamicin in an amount of 3mg/m2 on day 1 of<br>
chemotherapy in 55 patients. Thirty-three patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
with DAT. Eight patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin with DA. Fourteen<br>
patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin with FLAG-lda. Of the 55 patients<br>
treated, 41 (85%) entered complete remission with course 1 broken down as follows:<br>
(1) DAT=26/32; (2) DA=7/8; and (3) FLAG-lda=8/8. Prior experience in a separate<br>
trial designated MRC AML12 where 720 patients were treated with H-DAT alone in<br>
course 1, 64% of those patients achieved complete remission. In the present study,<br>
the median time to ANC recovery (1 x 109/l) was 27 days (range 9-54) and platelets &gt;<br>
100 x 109/l was 30 (range 21-48) which is within the mean + ISD of the 720 patients<br>
treated with H-DAT alone in the MRC AML12 trial. Non-hemopoietic toxicity was<br>
confined to the liver. Overall the maximum toxicity was Grade 1 = 5 patients, Grade<br>
2 = 22 patients, Grade 3 = 13 patients and Grade 4 = 10 patients. Of the Grade 3<br>
and 4 toxicities, 7 were felt to be definitely associated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
therapy. A possible contributory factor was the inclusion of Thioguanine. Of the 39<br>
recipients where Thioguanine was included in the schedules, 22 developed Grade 3<br>
or 4 liver toxicity compared with 1 for 16 recipients of non-Thioguanine schedules.<br>
Nine additional patients received H-DAT with 6mg/m2 gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin and 8 patients achieved complete remission with course 1.<br>
Hematological recovery was not prolonged, but 3 patients developed Grade 3 or 4<br>
liver toxicity of whom 2 developed a VOD-like syndrome from which both recovered.<br>
A 6mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was not considered feasible.<br>
Fifteen patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a dose of 3mg/m2 with<br>
courses 1 and. 2 (DAT 3+10 and DAT 3+8). ANC recovery was delayed in 5 patients<br>
and platelet recovery in 11, and both in 5 patients. Grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity was<br>
seen in 3 cases of whom 2 developed a VOD-like syndrome.<br>
Seventeen patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a dose of 3mg/m2<br>
with chemotherapy in course 3 with MACE (MACE: Amsacarine, AraC, Etoposide, or<br>
high dose AraC). Only one patient developed greater than Grade 2 liver toxicity.<br>
Twelve patients received induction in course 1 with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a<br>
dose of 3mg/m2 and course 3 with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a dose of 3mg/m2.<br>
This appears to be feasible but further study of this regimen is ongoing.<br>
The overall survival of all patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a<br>
dose of 3mg/m2 with course 1 at 6 months is 73% and at 12 months is 68%. For the<br>
patient receiving non-Thioguanine induction with 3mg/m2 of gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin, the 6 month survival is 91%.<br>
