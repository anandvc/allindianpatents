				<td>This invention relates to An improved process for the preparation of high protein nutritious biscuits. The biscuits prepared by the process of the present invention may have protein content of the order of 14%.<br>
Bakery products are increasingly becoming popular in India as indicated by an increase in its production from 1.9 million metric tons to 3.1 million metric tons during the last 10 years. It is estimated that biscuit market is growing at a rate of 7% per year. About 1.2 million metric tons of biscuits are manufactured by both the organised and unorganised sectors in India with an annual turnover of more than 2000 crores. Among the processed ready-to-eat convenient products, biscuits are the relatively lower cost processed foods. Besides, it has several other advantages such as long shelf life, easy availability in different tastes, flavour and texture and hence preferred by all cross section of the population. Nearly 50 - 55% of the total biscuits produced in India belong to sweet variety indicating its popularity amongst different sections of the population. Normal sweet type of biscuits contain 5 - 6% protein whereas high protein biscuits has a protein content ranging between 12 -13%. Many a times the biscuits are also fortified with thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, vitamin "A", vitamin 'D' and calcium to improve its nutritional quality. Protein rich biscuits have been found to be useful in diet therapy for treating of nutritional oedema syndrome and malnutrition in children. Hence high protein biscuits can be an excellent nutritional snack food vehicle with a high degree of acceptability especially to children.<br>
Subrahmanyan et al (Subrahmanyan, V., Bains, G.S., Bhatia, D.S., and Swaminathan, M. 1958. Manufacture of Nutro Biscuits. Research and Industry.   Vol. 3, 178 - 179) had   developed  a technology for manufacture<br>
of "Nutro Biscuits". The biscuit contained 15 - 16 % protein and was fortified with calcium and vitamins. The high protein content in the biscuit was achieved by replacing 40% of wheat flour with defatted food grade groundnut flour.<br>
The normal sweet type biscuits contain around 5- 6% protein. The "nutro" biscuits developed earlier (Subrahmanyan et al 1958) even though contains about 15% protein, the quality of the protein has been found to be poor, as groundnut proteins are deficient in the essential amino acid lysine. The biscuits were also reported to have low protein efficiency ratio of 1.3 (Subrahmanyan et al 1958). Besides, defatted edible groundnut flour is relatively expensive.<br>
Hitherto known processes for sweet type biscuits has a protein content of 5 - 6% and hence are not ideally suited for various nutritional programs and therapeutic uses. While high protein biscuits containing soy flour could have a quality protein content of about 13%. Soya proteins contain most of the essential amino acids, including lysine, in right proportions (Prakash, V., and Narasinga Rao, M.S. 1986. Physico chemical properties of oilseed proteins. CRC Review in Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., USA. Vol. 22, 1 - 134). The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of high protein nutritious biscuits.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use defatted soy flour as a source of protein. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein the protein content in the biscuits is enzymatically modified to improve digestibility. Still another object is to provide biscuits having highly<br>
acceptable taste, flavour and with an improved texture. Another object is to provide biscuits having protein content of the order of 14%.<br>
In the process of the present invention, defatted edible soy flour is used as a source of protein. The protein content of biscuits prepared using defatted soy flour conforms to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specification (13%). 'According to BIS specification edible soy flour should be white to pale creamy white in colour with pleasant aroma and characteristic flavour. In the present process for the production of high protein biscuits, the protein content in the biscuits is enzymatically modified to improve the digestibility and addition of the enzyme premix and soy flour at the appropriate unit operation to bring in the right texture and improvement in the quality of the product. The biscuits made from the above modification in the process has a highly acceptable taste, flavour with an improved texture. Proteins present in biscuits, modified with enzymes is of utmost importance to improve its digestibility and nutritional availability of amino acids and peptides at a rapid rate.<br>
Hence the nutritional quality of the biscuit improved by addition of the enzyme alkaline protease &amp; papain and its addition at the appropriate unit operation is the main novelty of this patent. Incorporation of the enzyme improves the digestibility as well as functional characteristics and flavour of the biscuit. It also subsequently helps in better absorption of the proteins. Incorporation of enzymes in the biscuit formulation results in improvement in texture and colour of biscuits also as it increases the total protein content to about 14% from about 6%.<br>
Accordingly the   present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of high protein nutritious biscuits which comprises:<br>
i) creaming conventional fat, sugar, corn syrup, emulsifier, flavouring agents, fat soluble vitamins and antioxidant,<br>
ii) preparing an aqueous suspension containing, conventional milk powder, common salt, calcium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and acid calcium phosphate adding to the above cream obtained in step (i) and mixing for a period of 5 - 8 minutes, in a conventional manner;<br>

Wheat flour is blended with soy flour and sieved to achieve uniform mixing.<br>
Preparation of premix:<br>
About 100 - 200g flour may be thoroughly mixed and blended with thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, calcium, and the enzymes.<br>
Creaming:<br>
Fat, sugar powder, corn syrup, emulsifier , vitamin A, vitamin D and flavouring agents are creamed so as to thoroughly blend the components and aerate the mixture.<br>
Mixing:<br>
Common salt, ammonium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate in water is added to the above cream. Milk powder suspension in water also added to the above cream. This is followed by addition of Acid calcium phosphate dispersed in small portion of formula water. Mixture is mixed into a homogeneous paste.<br>
Dough Mixing:<br>
Wheat flour - soy flour blend and vitamin - enzyme premix are added to the above cream mixture to form a homogeneous dough.<br>
Dough Resting:<br>
The above dough may be rested for about 28 - 33 minutes at 28 - 32C.<br>
Sheeting and Moulding:<br>
Sheeting and moulding of the dough is done in a rotary biscuit moulder using a circular die of about 4.5 mm diameter or as desired.<br>
Baking:<br>
Biscuits may be baked in a continuous tunnel type oven. Temperature range should be between 15O-26OC. Baking time should be between 4-6 minutes.<br>
Cooling:<br>
Biscuits are cooled to room temperature.<br>
Packing:<br>
Biscuits are either bulk packed in High Molecular High Density Polyethylene (HMHDPE) or in small unit packs in HMHDPE or in pearlized Biaxilary Oriented PolyPropylene (BOPP). The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The formulation used in the following example is:<br>
Ingredient	Quantity<br>
(9)<br>
Flour	150.0<br>
Soy flour (defatted)	50.0<br>
Sugar (powder)	90.0<br>
Fat	50.0<br>
Lecithin	0.8<br>
Com syrup	4.0<br>
Calcium carbonate	2.0<br>
Common salt	2.0<br>
Ammonium bicarbonate	2.0<br>
Sodium bicarbonate	1.0<br>
Acid calcium phosphate	1.0<br>
Skimmed milk powder	4.0<br>
Water	40.0 ml<br>
Example 1<br>
50 g of soy flour was mixed with 40 ml water containing 0.20 g papain and 0.10 g of alkaline protease and the dough was rested for 30 minutes at 30C. After the rest period, the above dough was mixed with other ingredients, specified in the above formulation, to obtain the biscuit dough. Biscuit dough was sheeted, moulded and baked. The results indicated that the biscuits prepared following this procedure were hard in texture with wrinkled and uneven surface. This could be attributed to the availability of water for gluten development resulting in harder texture. And also, with this method sufficient water will not be available for dispersion of salt, ammonium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate. Proper dispersion of the above chemicals is necessary to avoid black specks on the surface of the biscuits.<br>
Measurement of the physical characteristics of these biscuits showed that there was a slight decrease in the spread of the biscuits from 5.55 cm (control) to 5.47 cm. Density of the biscuits increased from 0.50 (control) to 0.62 indicating that the biscuits became harder when enzymes were incorporated in the soy flour.<br>
Example 2<br>
0.2 g papain and 0.1 g alkaline protease were mixed with the blend of soy flour and wheat flour. The biscuit dough was prepared by mixing rest of the formula ingredients. The dough thus obtained was rested for 30 minutes at 30C. The biscuit dough was then sheeted, moulded and baked.<br>
Biscuits prepared following the above procedure showed better spread than the control biscuits, which increased, from 5.55 cm to 5.62 cm. Density of the biscuits decreased from 0.50 (control) to 0.49.<br>
Subjective evaluation of the biscuits indicated an improvement in the colour of the biscuits, which was golden brown colour as against the light brown colour of control biscuits. Unlike the biscuits in example 1, these biscuits had very smooth surface and very crisp texture.<br>
Example 3<br>
In order to find out the improving effect of individual enzymes, two separate experiments were conducted. In the first experiment only papain (0.2 g) was used and in the second experiment only alkaline protease (0.1 g) was used. The method of incorporation of these enzymes was as in example 2. Using papain alone in the formulation did not improve spread of the biscuits. Density of the biscuits increased from 0.50 (control) to 0.53. Inclusion of papain alone did not bring much improvement either in colour or texture of biscuits. On the otherhand, biscuits made using protease improved spread of the biscuits from 5.55 cm (control) to 5.62 cm. The density of the biscuits decreased from 0.50 (control) to 0.49. There was an improvement in both the colour and texture of the biscuits and the extent of improvement was similar to that observed when both papain and alkaline protease were used together. Therefore, further biscuit trials were carried out using only the alkaline protease.<br>
Example 4<br>
Experiments were conducted to determine optimum level of alkaline protease required to get the desired improvement in the quality of the biscuits. The level of enzyme used were 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg respectively on flour weight basis.<br>
Evaluation of the physical characteristics of the above biscuits showed that the spread of the biscuits increased with each increase in the enzyme added. Hence diameter of biscuits containing 30, 40 and 50 mg of enzymes respectively were 5.57, 5.63 and 5.67 cm as against 5.55 cm for control biscuits.<br>
There was a decreasing trend in the density of the biscuits with each increase in incorporation of the enzyme level. Sensory evaluation of the biscuits indicated that colour of the biscuits did not improve with the addition of 30 mg of protease. With the addition of 40 mg, the colour of the biscuits changed from light brown to golden brown colour. With further increase in addition of enzyme (50 mg), the colour of the biscuits turned slightly dark brown. All the biscuits had smooth and even surface. Texture of biscuits containing 30 mg enzyme was similar to the control biscuits, while biscuits containing 40 mg protease were very crisp in texture. Due to the fact that neither the colour nor texture of the biscuits improved with addition of 30 mg protease and also that the colour of the biscuits were adversely affected with addition of 50 mg protease, addition of 40 mg protease which improved both the colour and texture of the biscuits was decided as the optimum level of protease to be included in the biscuit formulation.<br>
High protein biscuits thus prepared using specific protease and soy flour has the following advantages.<br>
1.	The biscuit dough containing the enzymes make the dough softer and<br>
hence<br>
improves its handling characteristics.<br>
2.	Inclusion of the enzyrne in the formulation improves the textural properties<br>
of the<br>
biscuits.<br>
