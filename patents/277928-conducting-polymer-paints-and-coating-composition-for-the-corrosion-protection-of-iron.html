				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the a process for the preparation of conducting polymer coating composition for the corrosion protection of iron based surfaces. More particularly the invention relates to a copolymer of aniline and substituted aniline synthesized in the absence of acidic environment and a process for the preparation of the said copolymer and subsequent paint formulations for the corrosion protection of iron.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The corrosion of iron and mild steel is an enormous problem throughout the world. Giving an anticorrosion treatment to articles of iron and materials containing iron is considered essential for durability of the articles due to hostile environmental parameters of humidity, salinity of water etc. Many kinds of treatment, paints and coatings have been developed over the years to address this problem. For a coating to protect iron against corrosion, it should restrict access of water, oxygen and other oxidants to the iron surface. In some instances, corrosion inhibitors such as zinc coatings or organic amines are used. Recently much interest has been shown in the use of conductive polymers in corrosion protection of articles made from iron or mild steel. These articles maybe such as huge ships used for marine transport.<br>
Reference may be made to "Corrosion-Protective Coatings from Electrically Conductive Polymers", Proceedings from Technology 2001, San Jose, California, wherein Thompson et al disclose conductive polymer coatings for the protection of iron surfaces from corrosion. These coatings involved electrically conducting forms of several polymers, including polyaniline which had been appropriately doped with additives serving as electron acceptors to increase conductivity of the polymer. These polymers were used by applying undoped chemically prepared polymers to the steel surface and subsequent doping of the coated surface to the conductive   state.   Doped   polyaniline  was   converted   to   a   non-conducting<br>
emeraldine base which was dissolved in an organic solvent such as, N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and coated on steel after which the coating was doped to the conducting state. The dopants used were tosylate ions, zinc nitrate and tetracyanoethylene. After doping, a top coat of standard fully cured epoxy was applied to provide abrasion resistance. In this disclosure the coating of the polymer dissolved in NMP is affected for curing by heating to a temperature of at least 95°C. The use of high temperature with NMP as the solvent is highly undesirable as during high temperature treatment, the NMP releases toxic gases. This work reported a corrosion barrier coating for steel made from an electrically conducting polymer which resists the transfer of electrons from iron to the oxidizing environment. The coating was said to have two layers: an undercoat of polyaniline on steel surface and an epoxy top coat for durability. The bilayer coating was reported to be more effective in resisting corrosion than a coating with epoxy alone.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 5441772, wherein a method of protecting carbon steel substrates from corrosion environments is provided by a coating of emeraldine base which has been chemically prepared and cast onto the substrate from NMP solution. The coating also includes other polymers such as polyimides, epoxies and urethane linked diisocyanates, among others. This invention also suffers from the disadvantage of the use of NMP which uses high temperature treatment for effecting a protective coating.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 5441772, wherein a method of protecting carbon steel substrates from corrosion environments by a coating of emeraldine base which has been chemically prepared and cast onto the substrate from NMP solution is disclosed. The coating also includes other polymers such as polyimides, epoxies and urethane linked diisocyanates, among others. In this patent disclosure, emeraldine base is dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidinone which is then applied on carbon steel substrates. A temperature of 80-90°C is required to evaporate the NMP solution resulting in toxic NMP vapours. Reference may be made to US Patent 5853621,wherein an anti corrosion paint of the type comprising one or more polymeric binders dispersed in liquid medium<br>
with an effective amount of non-conductive conjugated polymers is disclosed. In this patent disclosure, polyaniline is mixed with a dispersant from Daniel Products in a solvent propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and aromatic naptha 100.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 5922466, wherein the development of a composite comprising a metal substrate and a corrosion protecting layer on at least one major surface, a composition comprising a thermoset or thermoplastic polymeric matrix and a conductive filler component comprising polyaniline, and other conducting polymers has been disclosed. In this patent, a composition of thermoplastic or thermoset polymeric matrix along with polyaniline is applied on iron substrate. For thermoplastic coating, a temperature ranging from 100-200°C is required which is the melting point of the polymeric material. This blend is then applied on the iron surface. In this case firstly, the temperature needed is very high and secondly, this type of process is not suitable for industrial applications because the coating can be applied only when it is in the melt stage and once the temperature lowers down, solidification will start leading to the requirement of again raising the temperature to desired level to effect the coating. Reference may be made to US Patent 6015613, wherein a method of forming corrosion inhibition multilayer coatings is disclosed. When the coating is bonded to a substrate, it forms an inter layer between the metal and substrate. The laminates serve to protect the metal surface from corrosion in acid, salt and alkaline corrosive environments. In the said patent disclosure, C1018 steel electrodes are brush coated with a dispersion of polyaniline and poly(butylmethylacrylate) in butyrolactone. The coating coupons are allowed to dry at 60°C in an air convection oven. An epoxy topcoat of Carboline 890 was then applied at 60°C. In this case, only a dispersion of polyaniline in solvent is used which may not spread uniformly on the surface and once the surface is exposed to hostile atmosphere, corrosion rate may be accelerated. Reference may be made to US Patent 6239251, wherein a method of forming low molecular weight oligomers of aniline based compounds are disclosed which are end fictionalized and capable of being reacted with other monomeric species<br>
to form a variety of copolymers. In this patent, aniline is polymerized in the presence of 1,4-phenylenediamine, 1,4-aminodiphenyl amine, n.n'diphenylhydrazine, benzidine and the like. The coating of the above copolymer is prepared by dissolving the copolymer in dimethylformamide (DMF) and then combining with epoxy resin in the form of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether. Curing is done at 120°C for 1 hour. The temperature required for curing in the disclosure is 120°C.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  process of preparation  of conducting  polymer is described  herewith. Monomer aniline and monomer o-phenetidine (substituted aniline) are taken in a<br>
glass reaction vessel containing aqueous/methanol solution at 0°C. This reaction mixture is stirred and aqueous solution of the oxidant is added drop wise. The oxidant may be cupric tartarate, cupric tetrafluoroborate, cupric sulphate, cupric chloride, cupric phosphate and the like. More preferably cupric fluoroborate is taken. The reaction mixture is stirred preferably for 4 hours, till a greenish precipitate of copolymer is obtained. The mixture is filtered and washed thoroughly with good quality water and preferably distilled water though de-ionized water may also be suitably used, till the colour of the filtrate is colourless. The precipitate so obtained is vacuum dried at about 55°C. The resultant copolymer was used as a pigment which is mixed with acrylic resin and coated on iron electrode to study its behavior as a corrosion preventive coating in saline water.<br>
Electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out to determine the resistance of the coating after immersion in 3% NaCI.<br>
Organic compounds and polymers inhibit corrosion by absorbing at the metal surfaces. Modes of absorption depend on the chemical structure of the molecule like presence of pi-bonds or available lone pair of electrons, type of metal surfaces, electrochemical potential at the metal solution surface and complexation of molecules with metal ions neutralizing corrodant.<br>
In case of conducting polymer coating, adsorption takes place via functionalized nitrogen atoms of polymer nucleus oriented towards the metal surface and through the delocalized pi-electrons with the aromatic rings parallel to the electrode surface.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is the synthesis of conducting copolymer of aniline with o-phenetidine, o-toluidine, o - ethyl aniline and the like free from acidic conditions. The novelty of the invention lies in eliminating the use of toxic heavy elements like chromium, lead in the coating methods. Both these novelties are realized due to the inventive step of preparation of copolymer of aniline and substituted aniline like o-phenetidine by oxidation.<br>

Advantages: The main advantage of carrying the above studies was to see how the conducting polymer polyaniline and its copolymer synthesized without using acidic medium affects the corrosion inhibition behavior of iron &amp; mild steel in saline water conditions. Usually, polyaniline is synthesized in the presence of inorganic acid or organic acid medium by oxidant like ammonium persulphate, potassium persulphate, FeCl3, etc. However, in the present case, aniline and the copolymers of aniline are synthesized using cupric fluoroborate and copper phosphate in distilled water without the use of any inorganic or organic acid. And when these pigments are used in the conventional acrylic resins, then a better corrosion inhibition response was obtained.<br>
