detailed description of the invention<br>
l"he peritoneal dialysis system according to the invention is shown in a schematic way in figure 1. It includes a pump 1, a liquid distribution system 2 (also named cartridge) comprising a first hub chamber 7 and a second hub chamber 8. The first chamber 7 includes a pump inlet 26 connected to the pump 1 via a pump enter fine 56, a Squid supply port 9 with valve connected to supply means, e.g. to bags 3, via a liquid supply line 24 and a patient port 10 with valve connected to a patient 4 via a patient line 5. The second chamber 8 includes a pump outlet 27 connected to the pump 1 via a pump exit line 57, a drain port 11 with valve connected to a drain collector 6 via a drain line 25 and a patient port 18 with valve connected to a patient 4 via a patient line 5.<br>
Figure 1A shows the Till" phase where liquid is supplied to the patient 4 from and through the following elements : Bag 3 - Liquid supply line 24 - (open) liquid supply port 9 - First chamber 7 - Pump inlet 26 - Pump enter line 56 - Pump 1 -Pump exit line 57 - Pump outlet 27 - Second chamber 8 - (open) Patient port 18 - Patient line 5 - Patient 4.<br>
Figure 1B shows the "drain" phase where liquid is drained from and through the following elements : Patient 4 - Patient line 5 - (open) Patient port 10 - First chamber 7 - Pump inlet 26 - Pump enter line 56 - Pump 1 - Pump exit line 57 -Pump outlet 27 - Second chamber 8 - (open) Drain port 11 - Drain line 25 -Drain collector 6.<br>
The embodiment illustrated on figure 2 shows an assembly constituted by a pumping element 1 and a cartridge 2. Both elements are fixed together but may be separated. Figure 21 shows a better view of the fixation between both elements. Preferably, the pumping element 1 is fixed to the cartridge 2 by vibration attenuation means in order to minimize the vibration on cartridge 2 when the pump is operating.<br><br>
The upper face of tine cartridge contains a first hub chamber 7 , a second distinct hub chamber 8 and a cavity 15 which forms part of a pressure sensor. The first chamber hub chamber 7 has three liquid supply ports 9, one patient port 10, one pump inlet 26 and a cavity 36 which forms part of a pressure sensor. The second hub chamber 8 has a patient port 18, a drain port 11 and a pump outlet 27. The pumping element 1 comprises a pump casing 45 which contains three rollers 22 maintained around the pump casing center by a roller separator 12. The space between the roHer-rofler separator element and the pump casing defines a pump race 21 in which a flexible tube 37 is placed. The flexible tube being connected with the pump enter 56 and exit 57 lines. The rollers 22 may be motor driven by a shaft 52 (not shown on figure 2) in such a way as to progressively compress the flexible tube 37 resulting thereby in a peristaltic movement along the flexible tube 37.<br>
During the "fill" phase, liquid is supplied via one tube connector 53 and liquid supply port 9 to the first hub chamber 7. It then enters the pump 1 through the pump inlet 26, moves along the flexible tube 37, enters the second hub chamber 8 through the pump outlet 27 and goes to the patient 4 via patient port 18 and patient line 5.<br>
During the "drain" phase, liquid leaves the patient 4t enters the first hub chamber 7 via patient port 10. It then enters the pump 1, moves along the flexible tube 37, enters the second hub chamber 8 and goes to the drain collector 6 via drain port 11, drain tube connector 54 and drain line 25.<br>
It should be noted at this stage that each bag 3 may contain a specific liquid.<br>
The cartridge 2 of figure 3 is identical to the cartridge of figure 2 with the exception of an additional cavity, namely a warmer chamber 17, which includes a warmer port 19 and a patient port 16. The warmer port 19 is connected to a warmer 28 (not shown on figure 3) via a warmer tube connector 55 and a warmer exit line 30. The patient port 16 is connected to the patient line 5.  The second<br><br>
hub chamber 8 contains a warmer port 38 connected to a warmer 28 (not shown on figure 3) via a warmer tube connector 23 and a warmer enter line 29. During the "fiir phase, liquid is supplied via one tube connector 53 and liquid supply port 9 to the first hub chamber 7. It then enters the pump 1, moves along the flexible tube 37r enters the second hub chamber 8, moves into the warmer 28 via warmer port 38, enters the warmer chamber 17 via warmer port 19 through the tube connector 55 and goes to the patient 4 via patient port 16 and patient line 5.<br>
As it can be seen on the embodiments of figures 2 and 3, the pump 1 is unidirectional, i.e. whatever the pumping phase is, liquid in the flexible tube 37 always moves in the same direction. This feature provides several advantages. In particular a higher precision in the liquid exchange due to the same flow speed for both the fill and drain phases and a longer life time.<br>
It is known that peristaltic pumps are usually accurate within +/- 5%. As such, peristaltic pumps cannot be used for peritoneal dialysis since the volume which is filled within the patient cavity requires to be drained in the same amount within +/-2%, otherwise the peritoneal cavity could be overfilled (e.g. for 12 liters exchanged over the therapy, a 3% difference represents 360ml which is as much as 18% of the 2 liters contained in the peritonea! cavity for each cycle) and/or the ultra-filtration could be altered. In order to improve on the accuracy of the exchanged volume without requiring the construction of highly accurate pumps which would warranty a +/-2% accuracy, the invention provides a method whereby the conventional pump is used in a unidirectional way which insures the same accuracy for both the fill and the drain phase (usually within +/-2%) and therefore an appropriate balance of fluid. The volume filled with such a pump may be inaccurate within +/-5%, but since the same cassette with the same flow speed characteristics (namely the same flow direction) is used, the balance can be insured within +/-2% as required for the therapy. If the cassette would be used in both directions, the difference in flow speed would be within +/-5% due to the non parallel behavior of peristaltic pumps, in particular over time.<br><br>
It should be noted that with the present invention, the precision in the liquid exchange is maintained even if the pump flow rate changes after a certain time due to aging of the tubing since the fill and drain are operated within a time window which is small in comparison to the time in which the flow speed is altered by aging (e.g. a flow alteration of the pump of approximately 1% per 20 liters of fluid pumped, with exchanged volumes of approximately 2 liters per cycle). In addition, the use of the cassette in one direction enables a better control over the aging of the tubing and, therefore, a better prediction of the impact on the pumping accuracy.<br>
Figure 4 is a transparent view of the cartridge which better shows how the different elements are connected. A cartridge bottom view is shown on figure 5. The tubing system in the lower face and the cavities of the upper face are all made within one single part, e.g. an injected part of plastic material.<br>
Figure 6 shows an assembly including the cartridge 2 of figure 3 fixed to a pumping element 1, a patient line 5, supply bags 3, a warmer enter line 29, a warmer outer line 30 and a warmer pouch 28 which is essentially made of a fluid circuit within a plastic bag (e.g. PVC) to be put into contact with a warming plate.<br>
Figure 6" shows a warming plate contained into a warming system where the warming pouch has a shape of a sock to be inserted onto the warming plate. The warming pouch is composed of a liquid channel which forces the liquid to be maintained within such warmer for a certain duration at a given flow rate.<br>
Figure 7 shows a cartridge identical to the one of figure 3 where the rollers are part of the cycler rather than of the cartridge. In this embodiment, the pumping element 1 which only contains the tube and tubing race and the cartridge 2 are forming a single element.<br>
The rollers, which are part of the cycler and therefore re-usable rather than<br>
&gt;     disposable with the cardridge, have a conical shape so as to allow the rollers to<br>
be self inserted in the pump race. In this configuration the cartridge is more<br>
simple to manufacture and contains less parts. No other insertion mechanism is<br><br>
required, since the tube is automatically compressed on the race while the rollers are penetrating into the cartridge. As a separate matter, the use of conical rollers 22 results in a more constant speed of the liquid along the flexible tube 37. Figure 8 shows the assembly of figure 7 without the rollers 22 and the roller element<br>
Of course, other roller shapes may be used, e.g. spherical or cylindrical.<br>
The embodiment of figure 9 only differs from the one of figure 8 in that the pump casing 45 is made out of two parts with an interface between the pumping element 1 and the cartridge 2. This configuration offers an improved assembly process of the pump and the possibility to add means to limit the propagation of the vibrations from the pump 1 to the cartridge 2.<br>
Figure 10 shows a cycler 51 without cartridge 2 and pumping element 1. It contains a driving zone which includes a motor shaft 52 for the rollers 22 and several actuators 34. The cycler 51 also includes an air sensor 43 situated close to the patient line 5 when the cartridge 2 is inserted. The air sensor may be made of a piezo emitter and a piezo receiver.<br>
Figure 11 represents the embodiment of figure 2 with a flexible membrane 13 covering the hub chambers 7,8 and the pressure sensor cavity 15. The upper face of the membrane 13 (see figure 12) contains several valve elements having a cylindrical cavity 39 and a pressure sensor area 31 with a ply 40 around its periphery. The valve elements 39 are designed to tightly close the ports when the membrane 13 moves downwardly.<br>
On its bottom face (see figure 13) the membrane 13 contains a semi-circular flange 32 around the pressure sensor area and annular liquid tight joints. In addition the cartridge 2  includes liquid tight joints arranged in such a manner that they allow a liquid tight connection between the cartridge 2 and the i     membrane 13.<br><br>
Advantageously the membrane is molded. Preferably the membrane 13 is made<br>
of silicone.<br>
The membrane 13 is press-fitted to the cartridge 2 along its periphery with a<br>
membrane frame 14 (see figure 14).<br>
Figure 15 shows the cycler of figure 10 in an open state which includes a pump motor and a coder 42, The rectangle 41 represents the cartridge loader. Figure 16 shows a cartridge loader comprising cartridge loader shafts 46, a cartridge loader frame 47, a cartridge loader linear cam 48 and a cartridge loader motor 49. On this figure, the two displacement parts 48' and 48" represent two different positions of the loader in an open and closed position only for explanation reasons.<br>
The cartridge loading mechanism allows a tight connection between the membrane and the valves and the cartridge. In order to insure proper positioning of the cartridge onto the valve actuators, as well as pressure sensor and air sensor onto the right place, the cartridge is maintained into the loading mechanism which progressively moves the cartridge in an axis which is perpendicular to its surface. By the same movement, the axis or the rollers can be inserted in the right position to ensure proper functioning of the pump. The same movement can also insure appropriate pressure on the surfaces which requires to be maintained together, such as for tightness control on the membrane and/or tubing of the pump.<br>
Figure 17 shows the cycler 51 of figure  10 containing a cartridge 2. The cycler<br>
51 has an insertion slot 50 in an open position.<br>
Figure 18 shows the same cycler 51 but with an insertion slot in a closed position.<br>
Figure 19 represents an actuator 34 with its plunger 35 clipped in its corresponding valve element 39 of the membrane. The actuator 34 may be a magnet or an electromagnetic element. The plunger 35 and the valve element 39 are designed to move together when the actuator is activated.<br><br>
Figure 22a and 22b shows the plunger 35 and the valve element 39 in a separate position (fig. 22a) before insertion and in an activated position (fig. 22b) after insertion. One embodiment of the invention is to insure a proper insertion of the actuator head into the membrane clipping part by having the length of the part of the actuator head to be inserted into the clip of the membrane to be longer than the possible displacement of the actuator head, so as to ensure that the actuator head is always property inserted into the clip of the membrane. As such, in the worst case where the actuator head would be fully retracted within the actuator during the clippffxj translation into the membrane, the actuator head would pass the clipping equBIbrium position before the end of the translation, so that the remaining translation wfll ensure clipping of the actuator head into the membrane.<br>
The front view of figure 20 illustrates a pressure sensor 44 which may be used with the independent pressure sensor cavity 15 of the cartridge 2 or with the pressure sensor cavity 36 of the first hub chamber 7. The ply 40 makes the pressure sensor less sensitive to the elasticity of the membrane 13 in the sensor pressure area. In addition, the shape of the cavity 15 shall be made such that air can be eliminated easily when fluid is passing into the cavity (e.g. by having a round shaped bottom of the cavity within the direction of the flow).<br>
In the embodiments discussed previously, each port has a dedicated valve. This is not the case for the pump inlet and the pump outlet which are always kept open.<br>
The invention encompasses several other features not necessarily illustrated on the figures. For instance, the cycler or the cartridge-pumping element assembly may contain a window for detecting correct positioning of the flexible tube of the pump as shown in figure 21 (circle).<br>
When the system functions, the pressure is preferably always maintained positive with respect to the drain. This is a safety measure which avoids said contaminated liquid to potentially infect the patient.<br><br>
Advantageously the liquid pressure entering and exiting the cartridge is sensed and, if necessary, the pump flow rate is corrected in accordance with the pressure difference. This pressure difference is better calculated at the initial priming phase of the system, where the pressure is directly related to the positioning of the liquid bags 3 and the patient position relative to the cycler.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the pump flow rate may be regulated according to a predetermined deterioration of the tubing which is known from the characteristics of the tubing.<br>
The drain phase may be limited as to its duration in function of the drain speed, the drain speed having to be reduced when the patient peritoneal cavity pressure decreases, typically between 30 ml/min and 120 ml/min instead of a nominal 200 ml/min speed. This feature is particularly interesting because the dialysis efficiency is directly related to the time the liquid stays in the peritoneal cavity and the duration required to fully drain the peritoneal cavity may limit this time without a significant impact with regard to the peritoneal fluid characteristics. As such, one method of the invention would be to determine at which speed it is not worth continuing draining the patient entirely and rather fill the patient with fresh fluid, taking into consideration the remaining fluid volume in the peritoneal cavity which has not been expelled and expected ultra-filtration additional volume to avoid overfill. The cycles will therefore be all different, based on reaching a predetermined drainage speed or a pre-determined decrease profile of the drainage speed, so that the efficient time of dialysis will be increased. An example of drainage speed on a patient is given in the figure 25, where, for each column which is divided in three parts, the upper part corresponding to a limit of drainage speed at which it is, for example, not worth continuing the drainage even if the next fill volume will not be a full fill. In comparison to actual method where a tidal at (e.g. 80%) is preset, the method under the invention is adapting each drainage to the actual drainage speed, trying to empty as much as possible without compromising on the efficacy of the peritoneal dialysis. Of course some limits can be set, where a minimum of drainage volume has to be reached before such a limitation takes place for each cycle.<br><br>
Another method under the present invention consists to fill always as much volume, within certain limits to be set for the patient, until a certain pressure in the peritoneal cavity is reached. As such, the peritoneal dialysis can be improved since the efficiency is related to the amount of fluid filled at every cycle. According to such method, the pump shall fill the patient until a certain pressure is reached (e.g. 10cm water) and stop only once such pressure is reached or a certain maximum volume is reached. Accordingly, it is important to measure continuously the pressure during the dwell time to make sure that no over pressure is reached, such as due to the uKra-filtration. One possibility is also to always fill up to such a limited pressure and/or volume and drain at a certain interval thereafter a certain volume to compensate for expected ultra-filtration. Another possibility is to increase the ultra-filtration during the last cycle, by using e.g. low sodium concentrated solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
