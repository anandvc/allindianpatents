				<td>IMPROVED METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF<br>
NON-ORIENTED ELECTRICAL STEEL STRIP<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This present invention is related to and claims priority from U.S.<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/378,743, Schoen et al., filed May 8,<br>
2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Non-oriented electrical steels are widely used as the magnetic core<br>
material in a variety of electrical machinery and devices, particularly in<br>
motors where low core loss and high magnetic permeability in all<br>
directions of the sheet are desired. The present invention relates to a<br>
method for producing a non-oriented electrical steel with low core loss<br>
and high magnetic permeability whereby a steel melt is solidified as an<br>
ingot or continuously slab and subjected to hot rolling and cold rolling<br>
to provide a finished strip. The finished strip is provided with at least<br>
one annealing treatment wherein the magnetic properties develop,<br>
making the steel sheet of the present invention suitable for use in<br>
electrical machinery such as motors or transformers.<br>
Commercially available non-oriented electrical steels are typically<br>
broken into two classifications: cold rolled motor lamination steels ,<br>
("CRML") and cold rolled non-oriented electrical steels ("CRNO").<br>
CRML is generally used in applications where the requirement for very<br>
low core losses is difficult to justify economically. Such applications<br>
typically require that the non-oriented electrical steel have a maximum<br>
core loss of about 4 watts/pound (about 9 w/kg) and a minimum<br>
magnetic permeability of about 1500 G/Oe (Gauss/Oersted) measured<br>
at 1.5T and 60 Hz. In such applications, the steel sheet used is typically<br>
processed to a nominal, thickness of about 0.018 inch (about 0.45 mm)<br>
to about 0.030 inch (about 0.76 mm). CRNO is generally used in more<br>
demanding applications where better magnetic properties are required.<br>
Such applications typically require that the non-oriented electrical steel<br>
have a maximum core loss of about 2 watts/pound (about 4.4 w/kg) and a<br>
minimum magnetic permeability of about 2000 G/Oe measured at 1.5T<br>
and 60 Hz. In such applications, the steel sheet is typically processed to a<br>
nominal thickness of about 0.006 inch (about 0.15 mm) to about 0.025<br>
inch (about 0.63 mm).<br>
Non-oriented electrical steels are generally provided in two forms,<br>
commonly referred to as "semi-processed" or "fully-processed" steels.<br>
"Semi-processed" infers that the product must be annealed before use to<br>
develop the proper grain size and texture, relieve fabrication stresses and,<br>
if needed, provide appropriately low carbon levels to avoid aging. "Fully-<br>
processed" infers that the magnetic properties have been fully developed<br>
prior to the fabrication of the sheet into laminations, that is, the grain size<br>
and texture have been established and the carbon content has been reduced<br>
to about 0.003 weight % or less to prevent magnetic aging. These grades<br>
do not require annealing after fabrication into laminations unless so<br>
desired to relieve fabrication stresses. Non-oriented electrical steels arc<br>
predominantly used in rotating devices, such as motors or generators,<br>
where uniform magnetic properties are desired in all directions with<br>
respect to the sheet rolling direction.<br>
The magnetic properties of non-oriented electrical steels can be affected<br>
by thickness, volume resistivity, grain size, chemical purity and<br>
crystallographic texture of the finished sheet. The core loss caused by<br>
eddy currents can be made lower by reducing the thickness of the finished<br>
steel sheet, increasing the alloy content of the steel sheet to increase the<br>
volume resistivity or both in combination.<br>
In the established methods used to manufacture non-oriented electrical<br>
steels, typical but. non-limiting alloy additions of silicon, aluminum.<br>
manganese and phosphorus are employed. Non-oriented electrical<br>
steels may contain up to about 6.5 weight % silicon, up to about<br>
3 weight % aluminum, carbon up to about 0.05 weight % (which must<br>
be reduced to below about 0.003 weight % during processing to<br>
prevent magnetic aging), up to about 0.01 weight % nitrogen, up to<br>
0.01 weight % sulfur and balance iron with other impurities incidental<br>
to the method of steelmaking.<br>
Achieving a suitably large grain size after finish annealing is desired<br>
for optimum magnetic properties. The purity of the finish annealed<br>
sheet can have a significant effect on the magnetic properties since<br>
presence of a dispersed phase, inclusions and/or precipitates may<br>
inhibit normal grain growth and prevent achieving the desired grain<br>
size and texture and, thereby, the desired core loss and magnetic<br>
permeability, in the final product form. Also, inclusions and/or<br>
precipitates during finish annealing hinder domain wall motion during<br>
AC magnetization, further degrading the magnetic properties in the<br>
final product form. As noted above, the crystallographic texture of the<br>
finished sheet, that is, the distribution of the orientations of the crystal<br>
grains comprising the electrical steel sheet, is very important in<br>
determining the core loss and magnetic permeability in the final<br>
product form. The  and  texture components as defined by<br>
Millers indices have higher magnetic permeability; conversely, the<br> type texture components have lower magnetic permeability.<br>
Non-oriented electrical steels are differentiated by proportions of<br>
additions such as silicon, aluminum and like elements. Such alloying<br>
additions serve to increase volume resistivity, providing suppression of<br>
eddy currents' during AC magnetization, and thereby lowering core<br>
loss. These additions also improve the punching characteristics of the<br>
steel by increasing the hardness. The effect of alloying additions on<br>
volume resistivity of iron is shown in Equation I:<br>
where p is the volume resistivity, in µ-O, of the steel and %Mn,<br>
%Si, %A1, %Cr and %P are, respectively, the weight percentages of<br>
manganese, silicon, aluminum, chromium and phosphorus in the steel.<br>
Steels containing less than about 0.5 weight % silicon and other<br>
additions to provide a volume resistivity of up to about 20 µO-cm can<br>
be generally classified as motor lamination steels; steels containing<br>
about 0.5 to 1.5 weight % silicon or other additions to provide a<br>
volume resistivity of from about 20 µO-cm to about 30 µO-cm can be<br>
generally classified low-silicon steels; steels containing about 1.5 to<br>
3.0 weight % silicon or other additions to provide a volume resistivity<br>
of from about 30 µO-cm to about 45 µO-cm can be generally<br>
classified as intermediate-silicon steels; and, lastly, steels containing<br>
more than about 3.0 weight % silicon or other additions to provide a<br>
volume resistivity greater than about 45 µO-cm can be generally<br>
classified as high-silicon steels.<br>
Silicon and aluminum additions have detrimental effects on steels.<br>
Large silicon additions are well known to make steel more brittle,<br>
particularly at silicon levels greater than about 2.5%, and more<br>
temperature sensitive, that is, the ductile-to-brittle transition<br>
temperature may increase. Silicon may also react with nitrogen to form<br>
silicon nitride inclusions that may degrade the physical properties and<br>
cause magnetic "aging" of the non-oriented electrical steel. Properly<br>
employed, aluminum additions may minimize the effect of nitrogen on<br>
the physical and magnetic quality of the non-oriented electrical steel as<br>
aluminum reacts with nitrogen to form aluminum nitride inclusions<br>
during the cooling after casting and/or heating prior to hot rolling.<br>
However, aluminum additions can impact steel melting and casting<br>
from more aggressive wear of refractory materials and, in particular,<br>
clogging of refractory components used to feed the liquid steel during slab<br>
casting. Aluminum can also affect surface quality of the hot rolled strip by<br>
making removal of the oxide scale prior to cold rolling more difficult.<br>
Alloying additions to iron such as silicon, aluminum and the like also<br>
affect the amount of austenite as shown in Equation II:<br><br>
where ?1150oC is percentage of austenite formed at 1150°C (2100°F) and<br>
%Si, %A1, %Cr, %Mn, %P, %Cr, %Ni, %C and %N are, respectively, the<br>
weight percentages of silicon, aluminum, manganese, phosphorus,<br>
chromium, nickel, copper, carbon and nitrogen in the steel. Typically,<br>
alloys containing in excess of about 2.5% Si are fully ferritic, that is, no<br>
phase transformation from the body-center-cubic ferrite phase to the face-<br>
centered-cubic austenite phase occurs during heating or cooling. It is<br>
commonly known that the manufacture of fully ferritic electrical steels<br>
using thin or thick slab casting is complicated because of a tendency for<br>
"ridging". Ridging is a defect resulting from localized non-uniformities in<br>
the metallurgical structure of the hot rolled steel sheet.<br>
The methods for the production of non-oriented electrical steels discussed<br>
above are well established. These methods are typically involve preparing<br>
a steel melt having the desired composition; casting the steel melt into an<br>
ingot or slab having a thickness from about 2 inches (about 50 mm) to<br>
about 20 inches (about 500 mm); heating the ingot or slab to a temperature<br>
typically greater than about 1900°F (about 1040°C); and, hot rolling to a<br>
sheet thickness of about 0.040 inch (about 1 mm) or more. The hot rolled<br>
sheet is subsequently processed by a variety of routings which may<br>
include pickling or, optionally, hot band annealing prior to or after<br>
pickling; cold rolling in one or more<br>
steps to the desired product thickness; and, finish annealing, sometimes<br>
followed by a temper rolling, to develop the desired magnetic properties.<br>
In the most common exemplary method for the production of a non-<br>
oriented electrical steel, a slab having a thickness of more than about 4<br>
inches (about 100 mm) and less than about 15 inches (about 370 mm) is<br>
continuously cast; reheated to an elevated temperature prior to a hot<br>
roughing step wherein the slab is converted into a transfer bar having a<br>
thickness of more than 0.4 inch (about 10 mm) and less than about 3<br>
inches (about 75 mm); and hot rolled to produce a strip having a thickness<br>
of more than about 0.04 inch (about 1 mm) and less than about 0.4 inch<br>
(about 10 mm) suitable for further processing. As noted above, thick slab<br>
casting methods afford the opportunity for multiple hot reduction steps<br>
that, if properly employed, can be used to provide a uniform hot rolled<br>
metallurgical microstructure needed to avoid the occurrence of a defect<br>
commonly known in the art as "ridging". However, the necessary practices<br>
are often incompatible with or undesirable for operation of the mill<br>
equipment.<br>
In recent years, technological advances in thin slab casting have been<br>
made. In an example of this method, a non-oriented electrical steel is<br>
produced from a cast slab having a thickness of more than about 1 inch<br>
(about 25 mm) and less than about 4 inches (about 100 mm) which is<br>
immediately heated prior to hot rolling to produce a strip having a<br>
thickness of more than about 0.04 inch (about 1 mm) and less than about<br>
0.4 inch (about 10 mm) suitable for further processing. However, while<br>
production of motor lamination grades of non-oriented electrical steels has<br>
been realized, the production of fully ferritic non-oriented electrical steels<br>
having the very highest magnetic and physical quality has met with only<br>
limited success because of "ridging" problems. In part, thin slab casting is<br>
more constrained because of the amount of and flexibility in hot reduction<br>
from the as-cast slab to finished hot<br>
rolled strip is more limited than when thick slab casting methods are<br>
employed.<br>
For the above mentioned reasons, there has been a long felt need to<br>
develop a means to produce even the very highest grades of non-oriented<br>
electrical steels using methods which are more compatible with the<br>
capabilities afforded by thick and thin slab casting and which are less<br>
costly to manufacture.<br>

iii. Chromium: about 0.15% to about 2%;<br>

In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method, to<br>
produce a non-oriented electrical steel from a steel melt containing<br>
silicon and other alloying additions or impurities incidental to the<br>
method of steelmaking which is subsequently cast into a slab having a<br>
thickness of from about 0.8 inch (about 20 mm) to about 15 inches<br>
(about 375 mm), reheated to an elevated temperature and hot rolled<br>
into a strip of a thickness of from about 0.014 inch (about 0.35 mm) to<br>
about 0.06 inch (about 1.5 mm). The non-oriented electrical steel of<br>
this method can be used after a finish annealing treatment is provided<br>
to develop the desired magnetic characteristics for use in a motor,<br>
transformer or like device.<br>
In a second embodiment, the present invention provides a method<br>
whereby a non-oriented electrical steel is produced from a steel melt<br>
containing silicon and other alloying additions or impurities incidental<br>
to the method of steelmaking which is cast into a slab having a<br>
thickness of from about 0.8 inch (about 20 mm) to about 15 inches<br>
(about 375 mm), reheated and hot rolled into a strip of a thickness of<br>
from about 0.04 inch (about 1 mm) to about 0.4 inch (about 10 mm)<br>
which is subsequently cooled, pickled, cold rolled and finish annealed<br>
to develop the desired magnetic characteristics for use in a motor,<br>
transformer or like device. In an optional form of this embodiment, the<br>
hot rolled strip may be annealed prior to being cold rolled and finished<br>
annealed.<br>
In the practice of the above embodiments, a steel melt containing silicon,<br>
chromium, manganese and like additions is prepared whereby the<br>
composition provides a volume resistivity of at least 20 µO-cm as defined<br>
using Equation I and a peak austenite fraction, ?1150°C, is greater than 0<br>
wt% as defined using Equation II. In the preferred, more preferred, and<br>
most preferred practice of the present invention, ?1150°C is at least 5%,<br>
10% and at least 20%, respectively.<br>
In the practice of the above embodiments, the cast or thin slabs may not be<br>
heated to a temperature exceeding Tmax 0% as defined in Equation IIIa<br>
prior to hot rolling into strip. Tmax 0% is the high temperature boundary of<br>
the austenite phase field at which 100% ferrite is present in the alloy and<br>
below which a small percentage of austenite is present in the alloy. This is<br>
illustrated in Figure 1. By so limiting the heating temperature, the<br>
abnormal grain growth caused by re-transformation of the austenite to<br>
ferrite during slab reheating is avoided. In the preferred practice of the<br>
above embodiments, the cast or thin slabs may not be heated to a<br>
temperature of exceeding Tmax 5% as defined in Equation IIIb prior to hot<br>
rolling into strip. Similarly, Tmax 5% is the temperature at which 95%<br>
ferrite and 5% austenite is present in the alloy, just below the high<br>
temperature austenite phase field boundary. In the more preferred practice,<br>
the cast or thin slabs may not be heated to a temperature of exceeding Tmax<br>
10%. In the most preferred practice of the above embodiments, the cast or<br>
thin slabs may not be heated to a temperature of exceeding Tmax 20% as<br>
defined in Equation IIIc prior to hot rolling into strip. Tmax 10% and Tmax<br>
20% are the temperatures at which 10% and 20% austenite [is] are present<br>
in the alloy, respectively, at a temperature exceeding the peak austenite<br>
weight percent. Tmax 5%, Tmax 10%, and Tmax 20% are also illustrated in<br>
Figure 1.<br>

156(%Mo)<br>
The cast and reheated slab must be hot rolled such that at least one<br>
reduction pass is performed at a temperature where the metallurgical<br>
structure of the steel is comprised of austenite. The practice of the above<br>
embodiments includes a hot reduction pass at a temperature which is<br>
greater than about Tmin 0% illustrated in Figure 1 and a maximum<br>
temperature less than about Tmax 0% as defined in Equation IIIa, illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. The preferred practice of the above embodiments includes a<br>
hot reduction pass at a temperature which is greater than about Tmax 5% of<br>
Equation I Va and a maximum temperature less than about Tmax 5% as<br>
defined in Equation IIIb. The more preferred practice of the above<br>
embodiments includes a hot reduction pass at a temperature which is<br>
greater than about Tmin 10% and a maximum temperature less than about<br>
Tmax 10%, illustrated in Figure 1. The most preferred practice of the above<br>
embodiments includes a hot reduction pass at a temperature which is<br>
greater than about Tmin 20% of Equation IVb and a maximum temperature<br>

Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to<br>
those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the<br>
present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below.<br>
All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references<br>
mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the<br>
case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will<br>
control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are<br>
illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. Other features and<br>
advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following<br>
detailed description and claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the<br>
specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms,<br>
the following definitions are provided.<br>
The terms "ferrite" and "austenite" are used to describe the specific<br>
crystalline forms of steel. "Ferrite" or "ferritic steel" has a body-<br>
centered-cubic, or "bcc", crystalline form whereas "austenite" or<br>
"austenitic steel" has a face-centered cubic, or "fee", crystalline form.<br>
The term "fully ferritic steel" is used to describe steels that do not<br>
undergo any phase transformation between the ferrite and austenite<br>
crystal phase forms in the course of cooling from the melt and/or in<br>
reheating for hot rolling, regardless of its final room temperature<br>
microstructure.<br>
The terms "strip" and "sheet" are used to describe the physical<br>
characteristics of the steel in the specification and claims being<br>
comprised of a steel being of a thickness of less than about 0.4 inch<br>
(about 10 mm) and of a width typically in excess of about 10 inches<br>
(about 250 mm) and more typically in excess of about 40 inches (about<br>
1000 mm). The term "strip" has no width limitation but has a<br>
substantially greater width than thickness.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, a steel melt containing alloying<br>
additions of silicon, chromium, manganese, aluminum and phosphorus<br>
is employed.<br>
To begin to make the electrical steels of the present invention, a steel<br>
melt may be produced using the generally established methods of steel<br>
melting, refining and alloying. The melt composition comprises<br>
generally up to about 6.5% silicon, up to about 3% aluminum., up to<br>
about 5% chromium, up to about 3% manganese, up to about 0.01%<br>
nitrogen, and up to about 0.05% carbon with the balance being<br>
essentially iron and residual elements incidental to the method of<br>
steelmaking. A preferred composition comprises from about 1% to<br>
about 3.5% silicon, up to about 1% aluminum, about 0.1% to about 3%<br>
chromium, about 0.1% to about 1% manganese, up to about 0.01%<br>
sulfur and/or selenium, up to about 0.005% nitrogen and up to about<br>
0.01% carbon. In addition, the preferred steel may have residual<br>
amounts of elements, such as titanium, niobium and/or vanadium, in<br>
amounts not to exceed about 0.005%. A more preferred steel comprises<br>
about 1.5% to about 3% silicon, up to about 0.5% aluminum, about<br>
0.15% to about 2% chromium, up to about 0.005% carbon, up to about<br>
0.008% sulfur or selenium, up to about 0.002% nitrogen, about 0.1% to<br>
about 0.35% manganese and the balance iron with normally occurring<br>
residuals. The steel may also include other elements such as antimony,<br>
arsenic, bismuth, phosphorus and/or tin in amounts up to about 0.15%.<br>
The steel may also include copper, molybdenum and/or nickel in<br>
amounts up to about 1% individually or in combination. Other elements<br>
may be present either as deliberate additions or present as residual<br>
elements, i.e., impurities, from steel melting process. Exemplary methods<br>
for preparing the steel melt include oxygen, electric arc (EAF) or vacuum<br>
induction melting (VIM). Exemplary methods for further refining and/or<br>
making alloy additions to the steel melt may include a ladle metallurgy<br>
furnace (LMF), vacuum oxygen decarburization (VOD) vessel and/or<br>
argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) reactor.<br>
Silicon is present in the steels of the present invention in an amount of<br>
about 0.5% to about 6.5% and, preferably, about 1% to about 3.5% and,<br>
more preferably, about 1.5% to about 3%. Silicon additions serve to<br>
increase volume resistivity, stabilize the ferrite phase and increase<br>
hardness for improved punching characteristics in the finished strip;<br>
however, at levels above about 2.5%, silicon is known that make the steel<br>
more brittle.<br>
Chromium is present in the steels of the present invention in an amount of<br>
up to about 5% and, preferably, about 0.1% to about 3% and, more<br>
preferably, about 0.15% to about 2%. Chromium additions serve to<br>
increase volume resistivity; however, its effect must be considered in<br>
order to maintain the desired phase balance and microstructural<br>
characteristics.<br>
Manganese is present in the steels of the present invention in an amount of<br>
up to about 3% and, preferably, about 0.1% to about 1% and, more<br>
preferably, about 0.1% to about 0.35%. Manganese additions serve to<br>
increase volume resistivity; however, manganese is known in the art to<br>
slow the rate of grain growth during the finishing anneal. Because of this,<br>
the usefulness of large additions of manganese must be considered<br>
carefully both with respect to the desired phase balance and microstructure<br>
characteristics in the finished product.<br>
Aluminum is present in the steels of the present invention in an amount<br>
of up to about 3% and, preferably, up to about 1% and, more<br>
preferably, up to about 0.5%. Aluminum additions serve to increase<br>
volume resistivity, stabilize the ferrite phase and increase hardness for<br>
improved punching characteristics in the finished strip. However, the<br>
usefulness of large additions of aluminum must be considered carefully<br>
as aluminum may accelerate deterioration of steelmaking refractories.<br>
Moreover, careful consideration of processing conditions are needed to<br>
prevent the precipitation of fine aluminum nitride during hot rolling.<br>
Lastly, large additions of aluminum can cause the development of a<br>
more adherent oxide scale, making descaling of the sheet more<br>
difficult and expensive.<br>
Sulfur and selenium are undesirable elements in the steels of the<br>
present invention in that these elements can combine with other<br>
elements to form precipitates that may hinder grain growth during<br>
processing. Sulfur is a common residual in steel melting. Sulfur and/or<br>
selenium, when present in the steels of the present invention, may be in<br>
an amount of up to about 0.01%. Preferably sulfur may be present in<br>
an amount up to about 0.005% and selenium in an amount up to about<br>
0.007%.<br>
Nitrogen is an undesirable element in the steels of the present<br>
invention in that nitrogen can combine with other elements and form<br>
precipitates that may hinder grain growth during processing. Nitrogen<br>
is a common residual in steel melting and, when present in. the steels of<br>
the present invention, may be in an amount of up to about 0.01% and,<br>
preferably, up to about 0.005% and, more preferably, up to about<br>
0.002%.<br>
Carbon is an undesirable element in the steels of the present invention.<br>
Carbon fosters the formation of austenite and, when present in an<br>
amount greater than about 0.003%, the steel must be provided with a<br>
decarburizing annealing treatment to reduce the carbon level<br>
sufficiently to prevent "magnetic aging", caused by carbide<br>
precipitation, in the finish annealed steel. Carbon is a common residual<br>
from steel melting and, when present in the steels of the present<br>
invention, may be in an amount of up to about 0.05% and, preferably,<br>
up to about 0.01% and, more preferably, up to about 0.005%. If the<br>
melt carbon level is greater than about 0.003%, the non-oriented<br>
electrical steel must be decarburization annealed to less than about<br>
0.003% carbon and, preferably, less than about 0.0025% so that the<br>
finished annealed strip will not magnetically age.<br>
The method of the present invention addresses a practical issue arising<br>
in the present steel production methods and, in particular, the compact<br>
strip production methods, i.e., thin slab casting, for the manufacture of<br>
high grade non-oriented electrical steel sheets.<br>
In the particular case of thin slab casting, the caster is closely coupled<br>
to the slab reheating operation (alternatively referred to as temperature<br>
equalization) which, in turn, is closely coupled to the hot rolling<br>
operation. Such compact mill designs may place limitations both on<br>
the slab heating temperature as well as the amount of reduction in<br>
which can be used for hot rolling. These constraints make the<br>
production of fully ferritic non-oriented electrical steels difficult as<br>
incomplete recrystallization often leads to ridging in the final product.<br>
In the particular case of thick slab casting and, in some cases, with thin<br>
slab casting, high slab reheating temperatures are sometimes employed<br>
to ensure that the steel is at a sufficiently high temperature for rough<br>
hot rolling, during which the slab is reduced in thickness to a transfer<br>
bar, followed by finish hot rolling, during which the transfer bar is<br>
rolled to a hot band. Slab heating must be employed to maintain the<br>
slab at a temperature where the slab microstructure consists of mixed<br>
phases of ferrite and austenite to prevent abnormal grain growth in the<br>
slab prior to rolling. In the practice of the method of the present invention,<br>
the temperature for slab reheating should not exceed Tmax of Equation III.<br>
The rolled strip is further provided with a finishing anneal within which<br>
the desired magnetic properties are developed and, if necessary, to lower<br>
the carbon content sufficiently to prevent magnetic aging. The finishing<br>
annealing is typically conducted in a controlled atmosphere during<br>
annealing, such as a mixed gas of hydrogen and nitrogen. There are<br>
several methods well known in the art, including batch or box annealing,<br>
continuous strip annealing, and induction annealing. Batch annealing, if<br>
used, is typically conducted to provide an annealing temperature of at or<br>
above about 1450°F (about 790°C) and less than about 1550°F (about<br>
843°C) for a time of approximately one hour as described in ASTM<br>
specifications 726-00, A683-98a and A683-99. Continuous strip<br>
annealing, if used, is typically conducted at an annealing temperature at or<br>
above 1450°F (about 790°C) and less than about 1950°F (about 1065°C)<br>
for a time of less than ten minutes. Induction annealing, when used, is<br>
typically conducted to provide an annealing temperature greater than<br>
about 1500°F (815°C) for a time less than about five minutes.<br>
The present invention provides for a non-oriented electrical steel having<br>
magnetic properties appropriate for commercial use wherein a steel melt is<br>
cast into a starting slab which is then processed by either hot rolling, cold<br>
rolling or both prior to finish annealing to develop the desired magnetic<br>
properties.<br>
The silicon and chromium bearing non-oriented electrical steel of one<br>
embodiment of the present invention is advantageous as improved<br>
mechanical property characteristics of superior toughness and greater<br>
resistance to strip breakage during processing are obtained.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides processes to produce a<br>
non-oriented electrical steel having magnetic properties which have a<br>
maximum core loss of about 4 Watts/pound (about 8.8W/kg) and a<br>
minimum magnetic permeability of about 1500 G/Oe measured at 1.5T<br>
and 60 Hz.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides processes to<br>
produce a non-oriented electrical steel having magnetic properties which<br>
have a maximum core loss of about 2 Watts/pound (about 4.4W/kg) and a<br>
minimum magnetic permeability of about 2000 G/Oe measured at 1.5T<br>
and 60 Hz.<br>
In the optional practices of the present invention, the hot rolled strip may<br>
be provided with an annealing step prior to cold rolling and/or finish<br>
annealing.<br>
The methods of processing a non-oriented electrical steel from a<br>
continuously cast slab having a starting microstructure comprised entirely<br>
of ferrite are well known to those skilled in the art. It is also known that<br>
there are significant difficulties in getting complete recrystallization of the<br>
as-cast grain structure during hot rolling. This results in the development<br>
of a non-uniform grain structure in the hot rolled steel strip which may<br>
result in the occurrence of a defect known as "ridging" during cold rolling.<br>
Ridging is the result of non-uniform deformation and results in<br>
unacceptable physical characteristics for end use. Equation II illustrates<br>
the effect of composition on formation of the austenite phase and in the<br>
practice of the method of the present invention, can be used to determine<br>
the limiting temperature for hot rolling, if used, and/or annealing, if used,<br>
of the strip.<br>
The applicants have determined in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention wherein the strip is hot rolled, annealed, optionally cold rolled,<br>
and finish annealed to provide a non-oriented electrical steel having<br>
superior magnetic properties. The applicants have further<br>
determined in another embodiment of the present invention wherein the<br>
strip is hot rolled, cold rolled and finish annealed to provide a non-<br>
oriented electrical steel having superior magnetic properties without<br>
requiring an annealing step after hot rolling. The applicants have further<br>
determined in third embodiment of the present invention wherein the strip<br>
is hot rolled, annealed, cold rolled and finish annealed to provide a non-<br>
oriented electrical steel having superior magnetic properties.<br>
In the research studies conducted by the applicants, the hot rolling<br>
conditions are specified to foster recrystallization and, thereby, suppress<br>
the development of the "ridging" defect. Jn the preferred practice of the<br>
present invention, the deformation conditions for hot rolling were modeled<br>
to determine the requirements for hot deformation whereby the strain<br>
energy imparted from hot rolling was needed for extensive<br>
recrystallization of the strip was determined. This model, outlined in<br>
Equations IV through X, represents a further embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention and should be readily understood by one skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
The strain energy imparted from rolling can be calculated as:<br><br>
Whereby W is the work expended in rolling, 9c is the constrained yield<br>
strength of the steel and R is the amount of reduction taken in rolling in<br>
decimal fraction, i.e., initial thickness of the strip (tj, in mm) divided by<br>
the final thickness of the cast and hot strip (t/, in mm). The true strain in<br>
hot rolling can be further calculated as:<br><br>
Where e is the true strain and K1 is a constant. Combining Equation VI<br>
into Equation VII, the true strain can be calculated as:<br><br>
The constrained yield strength, ?c, is related to the yield strength of the<br>
cast steel strip when hot rolling. In hot rolling, recovery occurs<br>
dynamically and thus strain hardening during hot rolling is considered<br>
not to occur in the method of the invention. However, the yield<br>
strength depends markedly on temperature and strain rate and thereby<br>
the applicants incorporated a solution based on the Zener-Holloman<br>
relationship whereby the yield strength is calculated based on the<br>
temperature of deformation and the rate of deformation, also termed as<br>
the strain rate, as follows.<br><br>
Where ?r is the temperature and strain rate compensated yield strength<br>
of the steel during rolling, e is the strain rate of rolling and T is the<br>
temperature, in °K, of trie steel when rolled. For the purposes of the<br>
present invention, ?T is substituted for ?C in Equation VIII to obtain:<br><br>
where K2 is a constant.<br>
A simplified method to calculate the mean strain rate, em, in hot<br>
rolling is shown in Equation XI:<br><br>
Where D is the work roll diameter in mm, n is the roll rotational rate in<br>
revolutions per second and K3 is a constant. The above expressions<br><br>
can be rearranged and simplified by substituting em of Equation IX tor<br>
e of Equation IX and assigning a value of 1 to the constants, K1, K2 and<br>
K3, whereby the nominal hot rolling strain, e nominal, can be calculated as<br>
 shown in Equation XII:<br><br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, the cast slab is heated to a<br>
temperature not greater than Tmax of Equation III to avoid abnormal grain<br>
growth. The cast and reheated slab is subjected to one or more hot rolling<br>
passes, whereby a reduction in thickness of greater than at least about<br>
15%, preferably, greater than about 20% and less than about 70%, more<br>
preferably, greater than about 30% and less than about 65%. The<br>
conditions of the hot rolling, including temperature, reduction and rate of<br>
reduction are specified such that at least one pass and, preferably at least<br>
two passes, and, more preferably, at least three passes, impart a strain,<br>
e nominal of Equation V, greater than 1000, and, preferably, greater than<br>
2000 and, more preferably, greater than 5000 to provide an optimum<br>
conditions for recrystallization of the as-cast grain structure prior to cold<br>
rolling or finish annealing of the strip.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, annealing of the hot rolled strip<br>
may be carried out by means of self-annealing in which the hot rolled strip<br>
is annealed by the heat retained therein. Self-annealing may be obtained<br>
by coiling the hot rolled strip at a temperature above about 1300°F (about<br>
705°C). Annealing of the hot rolled strip may also be conducted using<br>
either batch type coil anneal or continuous type strip anneal methods<br>
which are well known in the art; however, the annealing temperature must<br>
not exceed Tmin of Equation IV. Using a batch type coil anneal, the hot<br>
rolled strip is heated to an elevated temperature, typically greater than<br>
about 1300°F (about 705°C) for a time greater than about 10 minutes,<br>
preferably greater than about<br>
1400°F (about 760°C). Using a strip type continuous anneal, the hot<br>
rolled strip is heated to a temperature typically greater than about<br>
1450°F (about 790°C) fqr a time less than about 10 minutes.<br>
A hot rolled strip or hot rolled and hot band annealed strip of the<br>
present invention may optionally be subjected to a descaling treatment<br>
to remove any oxide or scale layer formed on the non-oriented<br>
electrical steel strip before cold rolling or finish annealing. "Pickling"<br>
is the most common method of descaling where the strip is subjected to<br>
a chemical cleaning of the surface of a metal by employing aqueous<br>
solutions of one or more inorganic acids. Other methods such as<br>
caustic, electrochemical and mechanical cleaning are established<br>
methods for cleaning the steel surface.<br>
After finish annealing, the steel of the present invention may be further<br>
provided with an applied, insulative coating such as those specified for<br>
use on non-oriented electrical steels in ASTM specifications A677 and<br>
A976-97.<br>
Example 1<br>
Heats A and B were melted to the compositions shown in Table I and<br>
made into 2.5 inch (64 mm) cast slabs. Table I shows that Heats A and<br>
B provided a ?1150°c calculated in accordance with Equation II of about<br>
21% and about 1%, respectively. Slab samples from both heats were<br>
cut and heated in the laboratory to a temperature of from about 1922°F<br>
(1050°C) to about 2372oF (1300°C) before hot rolling in a single pass<br>
and a reduction of between about 10% to about 40%. The hot rolling<br>
was conducted in a single rolling pass using work rolls having a<br>
diameter of 9.5 inches (51 mm) and a roll speed of 32 RPM. After hot<br>
rolling, the samples were cooled and acid etched to determine the<br>
amount of recrystallization.<br>
The results from Heats A and B are shown Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.<br>
As Fig. 2 shows, a steel having a composition comparable to Heat A<br>
would provide sufficient austenite to prevent abnormal grain growth at<br>
slab heating temperatures of up to about 2372°F (1300°C). and using<br>
sufficient conditions for the hot reduction step, would provide excellent<br>
recrystallization of the cast structure. As Fig. 3 shows, a steel having a<br>
composition comparable to Heat B, having a lesser amount of austenite,<br>
must be processed with constraints as to the permissible slab heating<br>
temperature, about 2192°F( 1200°C) or lower for the specific case of Heat<br>
B, so as to avoid abnormal grain growth in the slab prior to hot rolling.<br>
Moreover, the desired amount of recrystallization of the cast structure<br>
could only be obtained using much higher hot reductions within a much<br>
narrower hot rolling temperature range. Fig. 3 shows both conditions of<br>
abnormal grain growth and insufficient conditions for hot rolling result in<br>
large areas of unrecrystallized grains which may form ridging defects in<br>
the finished steel sheet.<br>
Example 2:<br>
The compositions of Heats C, D and E in Table 1 were developed in<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention and employ a Si-Cr<br>
composition to provide a ?1150oc of about 20% or greater with a volume<br>
resistivity calculated in accordance with Equation I of from about 35 µO-<br>
cm, typical of an intermediate-silicon steel of the art, to about 50 µO-cm,<br>
typical of a high-silicon steel of the art. Heat F, also shown in Table 1,<br>
represents fully ferritic non-oriented electrical steel of the prior art. Table<br>
I shows both the maximum permissible temperature for slab heating and<br>
the optimum temperature for hot rolling for these steels of the present<br>
invention. The results of Table I are plotted in Figure 4. The austenite<br>
phase fields are shown for Heats C, D and E. Figure 4 also illustrates that<br>
Heat F is calculated not have an austenite/ferrite phase field. As Table I<br>
illustrates, a non-oriented electrical steel can be made by the method of the<br>
invention to provide a<br>
volume resistivity typical of intermediate- to high-silicon steels of the<br>
prior art while providing a sufficient amount, of austenite to ensure<br>
vigorous and complete recrystallization during hot rolling using a wide<br>
range of slab heating temperatures and hot rolling conditions.<br>
Moreover, the method taught in the present invention can be employed<br>
by one skilled in the art to develop an alloy composition for maximum<br>
compatibility with specific manufacturing requirements, operational<br>
capabilities or equipment limitations.<br>
