AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to data security and, in particular, to user authentication.<br>
2.	Brief Description of Related Developments<br>
[0002] A computer system may provide various applications or services for users. In general, access to the system may be limited to authorized users. One example of user authentication is a login process where a user is required to enter a user name and a password..<br>
[0003] In spite of new developments in technology, the combination of the user name and password remains one of the most common access control devices. However, passwords may be disadvantageous because fctiose that are easily remembered are the easiest to determine and those that are complicated and hard to determine are easily forgotten,<br>
[0004] The integrity of these types of systems is generally based on keeping the password secaret. "However, there are many known ways of det erminijigr a password, including guessing, applying a dictionasry of common passwords or even all known words, brute force attempts including applying all combinations of characters f monitoring network traffic for passwords during exchanges with the server,  ttshoulder surfing"  (looking over a<br><br>
user's shoulder during login), key logging ' (storing or conveying a user's keystrokes during login), etc,<br>
[0005] Known defensive measures against these types of attacks include making passwords longer to make them more difficult to guess, and making dictionary application and brute force techniques more difficult- Other defensive measures include prohibiting the use of ^meaningful* passwords such as user-related names, phone numbers, dates of birth, etc./ displaying a non-meaningful character such as an asterisk when a user enters a password, the shoulder surfer can see only asterisks, encrypting passwords before sending them over a network to prevent detection by network monitoring*<br>
[0006] One method of access control and authentication is the use of one time passwords (OTP) , where a user uses a different password each time they log in, thus rendering many of the above-mentioned attack techniques useless* To intercept, keylog, or otherwise determine a password offers no advantage because the password obtained can't be reused,<br>
[0007] Most generally available OTP systems share more or less the ' same protocol. As part of the login process, the server sends the user a so called challenge, which may simply be a large random number. The user enters this number into an OTP generator, for example, a special physical device or software that generates an OTP. The user enters the OTP. The server also enters the challenge into its own OTP generator. If the server OTP and the user OTP match, the user is authenticated.<br><br>
[0008] Where the OTP generator is a physical device<br>
(e.g., smart card, token, biometric device, etc.), the<br>
cost and inconvenience of a lost, broken, or stolen OTP<br>
generator may be of concern.	'<br>
[0009] In instances where the password-producing algorithm is the same for all users, each, user is assigned a secret key in order to make the outcome unique. This key is generally embedded in the user's OTP generator and is also stored in the server's database* There are several variations of this OTP generation scheme, for example, the time of day may be used to synchronize a user and server instead of a challenge. In most cases, security relies upon the integrity of the user's secret key. If the key is compromised, the system becomes ineffective. As a result, like a password^ the key becomes the subject of various types of attack, with brute force being one of the most popular. An additional layer of security is provided by protecting the algorithms that calculate the OTP, however, with some. persistence, the algorithms may be determined and are not a reliable security element.<br>
[00010] In a networked environment, a server generally provides various services and applications to a multitude of networked users. The server operates to verify a user in order to properly authorize the use of a particular service or application. This is typically accomplished by the standard login process described above, where the server matches a presently entered user name and password with a stored user name and password.<br>
[00011J It would be advantageous to provide an authentication system that is robust and resistant to<br><br>
dictionary 'applications, brute force attempts, traffic monitoring, shoulder surfing, key logging, and various other type of attacks.<br>
.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
100012] The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for authenticating a user. In one embodiment the invention includes creating an authentication key in the form of a user formula, presenting a user with an arrangement of variables, each assigned a value, applying the assigned values to matching variables in the user formula and calculating a first result, , and authenticating the user if the first result matches a second result of a separate and independent calculation of the user formula.<br>
[00013] In another embodiment the invention includes a system for user authentication including a user formula, an arrangement of variables, each assigned a value r a first result of applying tlie values associated with the arrangement of variables to matching variables in the user formula, the first result being input by a user, and circuitry for performing a separate and independent calculation using the user formula to obtain a second result, and for authenticating a user 'if the first result matches the second result.<br>

[00022] Figure 8 shows a block diagram of an exemplary message.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT (S)<br>
[00023] Referring to Figure 1, a user authentication system 100 incorporating features of the present invention is illustrated. Although the present invention will be described with reference to the embodiment shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the present invention can be embodied in many alternate forms of einbodiments• In addition/ any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used.<br><br>
[00024] As shown in Figure 1, the system 100 generally includes a user interface function, shown in this example by user interface 110 and an authentication control function/ shown in this example as controller 115*<br>
[00025] The present invention includes creating an authentication key in the form of a user formula. Upon initiation of an authentication session, a user is presented with an arrangement of variables, each assigned a value. The user applies the values associated with the presented variables to matching variables in the user formula and enters the result.<br>
[00026] Explained in more detail with reference to the flow chart of Figure 2, a user formula is generated as shown in block 310. The user formula may be constructed by a user from a set of variables and operations« The authentication system may provide an application to assist the user by providing lists of variables and operations from which to choose ♦ The authentication system may also provide an application that may generate a user formula automatically for a user. The resulting formula is generally memorised by the user and stored by the authentication system as shown in block 315.<br>
[00027] The user requests access to a device, service, application, or function, and an authentication session may then be initiated as shown in block 320. Upon initiation of an authentication session, the authentication system presents a user with an arrangement of variables as shown in block 325, each assigned a value. The user recognises the variables presented in the arrangement that match the variables in the user formula.  The user then applies the values assigned to<br><br>
the variables to the user formula, as shown in block 330 and enters the result as shown in block 335*<br>
[00028] The values may be randomly generated and assigned to the variables and may generally change with each authentication session. The authentication system independently applies the values assigned to the variables to the user formula and generates an independent result as shovm in block 340. The authentication system compares the independent result with the entered result as shown in block 345 and if the results match, the authentication system gives the user access to the sex-vice or application (block 35 0) , If the results do not match/ access is denied (block 355).<br>
[00029] As an example, a user might construct the following user formula; 3* (2*Q+3*T) . During an authentication session, an arrangement of variables and values is presented to the user. If the variable Q in the arrangement is assigned the value 32, and the variable T in the arrangement is assigned the value 9, the user formula yields 3* {2*32 + 3*9), or the number 273. The user then enters the number 273* Because the authentication system generated the arrangement of variables and values, and has stored the user formula, the authentication system uses the user formula to make the same calculations. If the results match, the user is authenticated,<br>
[00030] In addition to the authentication session described above, system 100 may provide an administration process as part of the authentication system. The authentication session includes qualifying a user for access to a device, service, application, or function as<br><br>
described above. The administration process generally provides a user with tools that allow a user to set up a formula, records the formula for subsequent authentication sessions, and handles other set up and administrative processes such as allocation of space and directories r encryption processes, communication between programs, etc.<br>
[00031] As mentioned above, as part of the authentication session, an arrangement of variables may be presented to a user. An example arrangement is shown in Figure 3. In this example, arrangement 360 includes a grid 365, an area for entering a user name 370, and an area for entering a password 375 that, in accordance with tlae present invention, is the result of applying the user formula. The grid 365 is made up of cells 380, where each cell may be denoted by a letter or letter combination 3 85 representing a user formula variable« Each variable is assigned a value 390, As mentioned above, the values assigned to each variable may change each time the arrangement is presented to a user. In one embodiment, each value is, produced by a random number generator each time the arrangement is presented.<br>
[00032] Using the exemplary formula 3*{2*Q+3*T) mentioned above, a user would examine arrangement 360 and recognize that variable Q is assigned a value of 69 and variable T is assigned a variable of 49« The user would apply the formula and enter the result.<br>
[00033] In this example, each cell includes two components, a variable and a value. while the variable is described in the context of letters and the .value is described in the  context of numbers,  it  should be<br><br>
-understood that  the variables  and.values  may" be  shown as any recognizable mark,   symbol,   or image.<br>
r<br>
[00034] Also in this example, the arrangement of variables is shown as a 10 by 10 cell grid* However, the arrangement may have any shape and may include any number of cells or locations.<br>
[00035] The user formula may include any mathematical and non-mathematical operator, for example, add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, max, min, mod, concatenate, etc. , and may also include parenthesis to alter the sequence of operations. The authentication system may also provide custom operators that allow a user to perform any function on the variables of the formula that may be desirable-<br>
[00036] Figure 4 shows an example of an administration screen 400 that may be presented to a user as part of the administrative process. The administrative process may provide a user with various tools, for example a ^wizard" that may walk a user through each step of a user set "up process, and a formula builder to assist a user in setting up a formula ♦ In one embodiment, the formula builder could provide a user with menus of variables and operators to choose from and assist the user with compiling a formula unique to that user.<br>
[00037] Administration screen 400 may include an arrangement of variables 405, a numerical keypad 410, keys for mathematical 415 and non mathematical functions 420, and keys for testing 425 and saving 430 a formula. Administration screen 400 may also include areas for entering a user name 370 and a user formula 440-  A user<br><br>
may enter a user formula by selecting among the variables and various operators*<br>
[00038] For example, a user may type a user formula using keyboard 145 (Figure 1). As the user types the formula it may be displayed in user formula area 440. Alternately, a user may use a pointing device to position a cursor over a character, variable, or operator and click a mouse button or press an enter key to select the desired character, variable, or operator. The selections are displayed in user f onmila area 440. The user continues until the user formula has been constructed as desired. When the user formula is complete, the user may then activate the wsave" button 43 0 to store and use the formula,<br>
[00039] In one embodiment, a user may be provided with a facility to construct one or more custom operators. For example, one of the operators may include an offset function, where the function is associated with a variable in the user formula and applies the value from a variable in the arrangement that is offset from the associated variable. The offset function may be expressed as (Offset (x, y)) where x refers to an x axis offset and y refers to a y-axis offset. An exemplary user formula that includes the offset function may be A+B(Offset {1, 1)). Referring to Figure 3, a user would first find and use the value assigned to variable A, and would then find variable B, but would use the value from variable M which is offset by the coordinates (1, 1) in this authentication session-<br>
[00040] A user may use any offset desired so long as the offset points to a variable present within arrangement<br><br>
365. In one exemplary implementation a user enters the offset function by simply typing * (Offset (x, y)" where desireci in the user formula. In another exemplary implementation; one of the'non mathematical functions 420 may include a button labeled ^Offset." Pressing the Offset button may initiate a dialog box that requests a user to enter the offset coordinates. Upon entering the coordinates, an offset designation, for example, (Offset (1, l) may appear in the user formula displayed in the user formula area 440.<br>
[00041] In another derivation of the offset function, a special offset may be determined, referred to as an IX function. The IX function utilizes the value associated with a variable as coordinates that point to the upper left hand portion of the arrangement. For example, a user may wish to use a user formula 2*B and may wish to designate variable K as specifying the upper left hand corner of the arrangement 365. After pressing the Offset button, in response to the request for coordinates, the user may respond with IX (K) or some other appropriate designation for the special offset and the designation.<br>
[00042] Subsequently, when the user is using the arrangement 365 to determine the result of the user formula, the user would observe that variable K is assigned the value M3" and then would consider the coordinates (4, 3) as the offset location for variable A, the coordinates (5, 3) as designating the offset location for variable B, the coordinates (6, 3) as designating the offset location for variable C, etc. Using the value at coordinates (S, 3), the user formula 2*B yields *104" which would then be entered in the password area 375-<br><br>
[00043] Other custom operators may be created'that perform any function, operation, or combination of functions or operations.<br>
[00044] As another example, administration screen 400 may include a selection for creating a custom function that operates on one or more variables. The custom function could include any number of mathematical, logic (AHD, OR, XOR, etc.) trigonometric, statistical, etc. types of operations. A user may be presented with one or more scripts that may be used as templates for designing custom functions. Scripts may also be provided for presenting buttons or menu items to users for invoking the custom fxinctions and for using the custom functions in user formulas.<br>
[00045] The ability 'to create custom functions is advantageous because it allows a system to be customized for a particular user or a portion of an enterprise. A purchaser of the system is provided with the ability to further enhance the security of the system by creating custom functions and operators not available or known to other system purchasers.<br>
[00046] The authentication system may offer a greater measure of security by providing a function that creates<br>
a formula within a formula, referred to as an AutoToken™ function. A user invokes the AutoToken™ function, for example, by selecting an AutoToken™ key 435 (Figure 4) .<br>
The AutoToken™ function prompts the user for a user formula which the user enters in the user formula area 440.<br><br>
[00047] The AutoToken™ function automatically creates two formulas, referred to as a local formula, and a remote formula, respectively* Each of the local and remote formulas includes variables, constantsl and operations that may be randomly selected and randomly ordered so long as, they form an operational formula. The variables, constants and operations may include variables from tlie arrangement of variables that is presented to a user and operations provided by the administration process. Th&amp; local and remote formulas may be of any complexity and length and are generally the same except that the local formula includes a result variable for receiving the result of the user formula that will be input by a user, while the remote user formula includes the user formula itself.<br>
[00048] The remote formula may be stored at any location designated by the authentication system and the local formula may be stored in a location local to the user. In one eTnbodiment, the local formula may be stored at any location designated or selected by the user.<br>
[00049] The local formula may be transportable for use in accessing a device, service, application, or function, from a different location. For example, the local formula may be stored so that it is portable, which includes storing the local formula on any type of transportable media, for example, magnetic, optical, semiconductor, or other suitable media. The local formula may be stored on, for example, a floppy disk, compact di sk, f 1 ash memory card, USB drive, or any suitable device for storing and accessing the local formula (e.g. 247 in Figure 5, described below).<br><br>
[00050] In one embodiment, the local formula may not necessarily be stored but may be transported or transmitted to another location for use by the user,<br>
[00051] An authentication session for a user who has implemented an AutoToken™ function proceeds as follows. The user requests access to a device, service, application, or function, and an authentication session is initiated- The system presents the user with an arrangement of variables and the user enters the result of his user formula. If the local formula has been stored on transportable media, at this time or at any time prior to this point, the transportable media is coupled to the system so that the local fortmila is accessible by the authentication system &gt; The authentication system inserts the result in place of the result variable in the local formula, inserts values from the arrangement of variables into the rest of the local formula, and computes the result of the local formula. The authentication system also inserts values from the arrangement of variables into the user formula in tha remote formula, as well as the rest of the remote formula/ and computes the result of the remote forrtrula.<br>
[00052] The authentication system compares the results, and if they match the user is granted access to the device, service, application, or function desired.<br>
[00053] If for some reason a user's user formula is compromised, the user may invoke the AutoToken™ function again to create new local, remote, and user formulas without requiring additional support resources/ thus securing the continuation of secure access.<br><br>
[00054] As another feature, the authentication system generally allows a user to embed functions within other functions to extend the security of a user formula. For example, a user formula could include A+(AVE(AVE B+C+(AVE D+E+P)) +G+H) , A special function may be used to embed dummy characters within a user formula based on a value assigned to a variable from the arrangement 365. Rais function could be designated as a *Set* function. An exemplary user formula using the Set function may be:<br>
(set Z, 1)[user formula] .<br>
[00055] In an arrangement where the variable Z is assigned the value 5, a user would type in five dummy characters before entering the first value of the result of the' user formula. Thus, any number of dummy characters may be inserted at any location within the result of a user formula,<br>
[00056] As an additional security feature, a user formula could use values assigned to variables of the arrangement 365 to designate specific letters within specific words of a secret phrase. For example, a user may determine that their secret phrase may be "the dog is lazy,* and may decide on a user formula of ABCD- When constructing their user formula, the user could type commands designating their secret phrase and their user formula into user formula area 440.<br>
[00057] Alternately, the non mathematical functions 420 may include f-unctions that allow a user to select the designations. During authentication, an arrangement may be presented; for example, where A is assigned the value 31, B is assigned the value 14, C is assigned the value<br><br>
21, and .D is assigned the value 13. Applying the values of the arrangement to the phrase for A^31 would yield the third 'letter of the first word, B=14 yields the first letter of the fourth word/ C=21 yields the second letter of the first word, and D=13 yields the first letter of the third word* Thus, the user would type .in ELHI. Given the arrangement and the secret nature of the phrase, an attempt at deciphering such a result would most likely result in failure.<br>
[00058] The authentication system may offer a greater measure of security by providing a reset function within a user formula* This reset function operates to reset the variable arrangement presented to the user. For example, as part of an authentication session, an arrangement of. variables as shown in Figure 3 is presented to the user. The user examines the arrangement, recognizes the value of the first variable of the user's formula and enters the first variable. After entering the first variable, the reset function is activated, for example, by a command in the user formula or by typing a command, and the values and variables are changed such that the user is presented with a l new arrangement. The user continues to utilize the user formula, recognising the value of the next variable in the formula from the new arrangement* When the user has recognised all the values, computed and entered the result of the user formula, the user is granted access as desired.<br>
[00059] An example of a user formula using the reset function may be:<br><br><br>
where the value associated with variable A is concatenated with the value associated with B, the variable arrangement is reset and the concatenation of A and B is concatenated with the new value of variable C*<br>
[00060] It should be understood that the reset function may be 'inserted anywhere in the user formula and may be inserted in one or more places in the user formula. The reset function may be activated by various methods, for example/ as a response to pressing a particular key, or automatically after a value has been entered.<br>
[00061] Referring to the administration screen in Figure 4, the reset function may be presented to a user as part of a formula builder, or "wizard" that provides a' user with a step by step process for inserting the reset function.<br>
[00062] As mentioned above, the reset function operates to reset the variable arrangement presented to a user. This may take the form of regenerating new values for the-variables in the arrangement, changing the location of the variables or a combination of both- The reset function may generate the new arrangement using a formula that is based on a seed number or variable provided by a user during the formula builder or wizard process* The variable seed may be a variable from the variable arrangement present to the user,<br>
[00063] Thus, the reset function provides a. heightened level of security to the present invention. For example, in a networked environment, if communication between . a desktop computer and a server is intercepted, data about the variable arrangement may be extracted. For example,<br><br>
one might attempt (albeit -unsuccessfully) to derive the variable arrangement from the intercepted data. The reset function operates to reset the variable arrangement locally, without external communication. Thus, efforts to derive the variable arrangement by intercepting communications are rendered useless because a new variable arrangement is generated and there is no communication associated with the reset or the new variable arrangement.<br>
[00064] Referring again to Figure 1, system 100 may be a desktop computer that includes user interface 110 and controller 115, Controller 115 may include one or more processors 120 for executing an authentication program 135 from a memory 125 and may also include a storage device 130 for storing information, data, and programs. Controller 115 may also include an interface for communicating with other devices.

[00075] Figure 6 illustrates another embodiment of the invention shown as a distributed system 600 for electronic business transactions or e-commerce. System 600 may be Internet based and may use the World Wide Web as a common communication medium. System 600 generally provides all the features, of the previously described embodiments and includes a number of iisers 610a, .., 610s, a controller 620,, and a number of applications or services 650a. . . 650a. Users 610i -*. 610n, services 650i 650n/ and controller 620 generally represent independent entities, for example,, business entities, that are connected by the Internet 660. For example, users 610! .« • 6iOa may be individuals accessing the services or may be computing devices accessing the services under program control* In one embodiment, users 610j .. . 610a may pay a fee to access one or more of the services 650x , ♦ . 650* and a controller 620 operates to<br><br>
control . such access through Authentication, The operators of services 6501 — 650n in turn may pay a fee to a controller operator for the access and authentication services. ' Other business arrangements among the users, service operators and controller operator are also contemplated- Controller , 620 may include one or more processors 425 for executing programs 63 0 that control user authentication and access to services 6501  650n. Controller 620 operates to authenticate users 6101 „ * . 610n and to provide one or more services 6501 . , . 650n to an authenticated user. The services 6501 _ 650n may include any service to which users 610i  610n may require access including e-commerce transactions. For example, services 650* 65 0n may include merchandise purchasing systems, data processing systems, ' computational services, content delivery services for delivering text, audio or video, etc., all participating in commercial transactions over a network, such as the Internet.<br>
[00076] In system 600, one or more users 610-L «-- 610* may routinely access services 650x  . . 650fl. Controller 620 monitors or is notified of the attempted access. For example, controller 620 may monitor and intercept all attempts to access any of services 6501 . . - 650n. In another example, services 6501 ... 650a may automatically route all access attempts to controller 620 for processing or otherwise notify controller 620 of an attetnpted access.<br>
[00077] In response, controller 620 initiates an authentication session with each user 610 to determine if the particular user is eligible, has permission, or is<br><br>
generally allowed to access the one or more services 65 0a  650n. If the user 610 provides the proper credentials, that is, the proper result of the user formula as described herein, controller 520 allows access to the desired service or services.<br>
[00078] In another embodiment/ a user S10 may attempt to access one or more services S501 650n where access to the service is granted on a one-time basis- Controller 620 is notified or actively monitors the attempted access- In response, controller 620 initiates an authentication session with the user 610. An administrator, which may be a program or an operator, conveys a user formula to the user 610 that is only valid for a single use. The user 610 enters the result of the one time user formula and is generally allowed to access the one or more services '6501 - . - 650n.<br>
[00079] Figure 7 shows a system 700 that utilizes an embodiment of the present invention for securing data sent as part of a message, for example, by email. The system 700 includes a message originator 705 that utilizes the authentication system 710 of the present invention, a recipient "715 and a communications network-Both the originator 7 0S and recipient 71S include one or more processors, memory devices and programs to support mes sage trans fer and authent i cation operat ions according the present invention. The originator 705 constructs a message, for example an email/ that includes data the originator 705 wishes to secure. A block diagram of such a message 810 is shown in Figure 8. The data 820 may be included as part of the message or as a file attached to the message.  The authentication system 710 includes a<br><br>
1<br>
wrapper 825 with the message 810 and data 820 that will initiate an authentication session and prevent access to the data 820 unless the recipient 715 produces the proper credentials  The message is then conveyed to the recipient 715, for example, using a standard email protocol.<br>
[00080] Upon receipt, the recipient 715 attetnpts to open the message. The wrapper initiates an authentication session, displaying an arrangement as shown in Figure 3. A return receipt to the originator is also generated which causes the same authentication session to be initiated for the originator 705,<br>
[00081] The originator 705 determines the result of the originator7 s user formula and then conveys the result to the recipient 715, generally through a method different from the one used to convey the message, The recipient enters the result and, if correct, the wrapper 825 allows access to the data 820  Once the data is closed the authentication session ends. Each time an attempt is made to open the message, another authentication begins with a new arrangement. Thus, the arrangement includes new values assigned to the variables and requires the originator 705 to again determine the results of applying the originator's user formula. Therefore, if the recipient 715 attempts to open the message again, or forwards the message to another, the previous result of the user formula is no longer operable to open the message and the originator 705 may be notified.<br>
