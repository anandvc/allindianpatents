				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a Light Emitting Method and Device and particularly to a method for generating light of desired colour, more particularly to a device and method for activating one type of material to emit secondary light of a desired colour, by applying primary light thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally it always requires either extremely high manufacturing / development cost or significant price of sacrificing quality, to make a LED (light emitting diode) capable of emitting light of very high frequency such as blue and violet light, or to make a EL (electro-luminescence) capable of emitting red and violet light.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A general object of the present invention is to provide a simple and economic device and method for obtaining light of desired colours.<br>
A particular object of the present invention is to provide a simple and economic device and method for obtaining light of particular colours such as blue and violet light.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention may be a light emitting method for emitting light, which is characterized in that a primary light source emits primary light to activate a secondary light source to emit secondary light of a colour different from that of the primary light. The secondary light source is activated to have the energy level of electrons therein changed for emitting the secondary light. This is a result of the fact that the electrons of the secondary light source as a whole are activated to be at a higher energy level than natural and stable status. Obviously there shall be energy release when part or all of the electrons return to natural/stable status from the higher energy level, which is unstable. The secondary light is thus generated as a result of the energy release.<br>
The primary light source may be selected from among an electro- luminescent (EL) source and a light emitting diode (LED). The primary light source and the secondary light source are usually different in the structure, shape, and size of molecule crystal lattice thereof.  The secondary light source may be  selected from  among transitional metal<br>
2<br><br>
compound,  transitional  complex  metal  compound,  azo  compound,  and  a  variety  of fluorescent or phosphate materials.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention may be a light emitting device for emitting light of various colours, which comprises: a primary light source for emitting primary light; and<br>
a secondary light source receiving the primary light to emit secondary light of a colour different from that of the primary light.<br>
Obviously the primary light source may also be selected from among an electroluminescent (EL) source and a light emitting diode (LED), and the primary light activates the secondary light source to emit secondary light after being received thereat the secondary light source. The secondary light source is an approximately flat layer of material with electronic energy levels easily activated, whereby the secondary light source is easily activated to emit the secondary light.<br>
The primary light source and the secondary light source for this embodiment are also different in the structure, shape, and size of molecule crystal lattice thereof. The secondary light source may also be selected from among transitional metal compound, transitional complex metal compound, azo compound, and a variety of fluorescent or phosphate materials.<br>
If the primary light reaching the secondary light source is fully absorbed by the secondary light source, the colour of the secondary light is determined according to the colour of molecules of the secondary light source.<br>
If the primary light reaching the secondary light source is partially absorbed by the secondary light source, part of the primary light not absorbed penetrates the secondary light source, and another part of the primary light which is absorbed by the secondary light source activates the secondary source to emit secondary light, the part of the primary light penetrating the secondary light source and the secondary light mix together to form a compound light. If the primary light and the secondary light are complementary colours, the<br>
compound light is white.<br>
The embodiment may further comprise a layer of coloured material for receiving the<br>
white compound light to emit light of a colour determined according to the colour of the coloured material. Practically the embodiment may be so configured that the layer of<br>
3<br><br>
coloured material receiving the white compound light may emit light of a colour the same as that of the coloured material.<br>
The present invention may best be understood through the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is for illustrating a typical transition mode between different energy levels for the electrons (or molecules) of material.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment comprising a primary light source and a secondary light source.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another embodiment further comprising a layer of coloured material in addition to a primary light source and a secondary light source.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a typical energy level transition for electrons (or molecules) of one type of material, such as the secondary light source according to the present invention, which is activated by external energy applied thereto. The status of raising (E2-EO = E2O) energy level from EO to E2 as a result of the external energy applied thereto is usually unstable, and shall lead to energy release E21 (= E2-E1) in response to the transition from energy level E2 to El (may be due to variation of the externally applied energy, such as reduction or removal of the applied energy). Energy release E21 can be in the form of light emission such as the secondary light in the embodiment of the present invention. The energy level transition E1O (=E1-EO) may be in the form of heat dissipation. The externally applied energy for leading to the energy level transition E2O can be in the form of light such as the primary light applied to<br>
the secondary light source according to the present invention.<br>
When activated by external energy, the transitional metal compound or transitional<br>
complex metal compound which can be used as secondary light sources, will have electrons in P orbit thereof promoted to D orbit thereof. This is because some electrons originally residing in crowded P orbit tend to move between P orbit and D orbit, some even tend to reside in the sparse D orbit, and thereby the electrons as a whole are easily activated. Due to<br>
4<br><br>
higher cost, the transitional metal compound or transitional complex metal compound are usually replaced by azo, compound or fluorescent material.<br>
Shown in Fig. 2 is an embodiment of a light emitting device / method according to the present invention, wherein a primary light source 23 in the form of a layer of material such as a conventional light emitting device, is covered by a layer of secondary light source 24 such as transitional metal compound, transitional complex metal compound, azo compound, or a variety of fluorescent or phosphate materials. Primary light source 23 emits primary light 22 to activate secondary light source 24 so that the electrons (or molecules) of secondary light source 24 are put at an unstable energy level such as E2 in Fig. I. The energy release of secondary light source 24 as a result of the energy level transition from the unstable level E2 to another level El, such as E21 in Fig. 1, appears as secondary light 25 emitted from secondary light source 24.<br>
It must be noted that the frequency of secondary light 25 varies with the structure, shape, size, and oscillating frequency of molecule crystal lattice of secondary light source 24, hence the embodiment may be so configured (proper selection of material to be the secondary light source, for example) that the colour of secondary light 25 which corresponds to (or determined according to) the frequency of secondary light 25 is what we desire. Because the cost to acquire material for making secondary light source 24, primary light source 23, and for forming a configuration to emit light of desired colours is cheap, it shall be clear the present invention can provide a cost-effective device and method for generating light of desired colours by applying to secondary light source 24 a beam of light which can be easily and economically generated by conventional devices.<br>
The intensity of the primary light emitted by primary light source 23 and the thickness of secondary light source 24 can be so adjusted that part of the primary light is absorbed by secondary light source 24 to activate secondary light source 24 to emit secondary light 25, while another part 26 of the primary light 22 penetrates secondary light source 24 to mix together with secondary light 25 for forming a compound light 27 of a colour different from that of secondary light 25. For example, suppose primary light 22 of blue colour is applied to secondary light source 24 which is composed of molecules of orange colour and which can not fully absorb primary light 22 (may be because the number of molecules therein is not big enough, for instance), part of the primary light 22 of blue colour thus penetrates secondary light source 24 to appear as light 26 of blue colour, another part of the primary light 22 of<br>
5<br><br>
blue colour absorbed by secondary light source 24 can be deemed as if being converted into secondary light 25 of orange colour. Compound light 27 of white colour may be formed by mixing light 26 of blue colour and secondary light 25 of orange colour, because blue colour and orange colour are complementary .Now if a layer of coloured material (for example, red material) 31 of high transparency (allow light to penetrate) as shown in Fig. 3 is used to cover secondary light source 24 from which compound light 27 of white colour is emitted, the light 32 coming out of 31 shall have its colour the same as that of coloured material 31. It is especially worthwhile to apply the present invention to the production of red light based on EL (electro-luminescence), as can be seen from the fact that no pure red light has ever been made on the basis of EL for lack of red fluorescent powder made on the basis of EL in the market.<br>
It must be noted that the layer of coloured material 31 (such as red material) usually absorbs light of all colours except the light of the colour (such as red one) the same as that of coloured material 31. If the layer of red coloured material 31 is seated between primary light source 23 and secondary light source 24 in the above example, the blue light will be fully absorbed, and no light will reach secondary light source 24, thereby no secondary light can be seen.<br>
On the contrary, If the colour of primary light 22 is orange and secondary light source 24 is composed of molecules of blue colour in the above example, the colour of compound light 27 may be either white or various kinds of blue (ranging from light blue to dark blue). If primary light 22 is of green colour and secondary light source 24 is composed of either molecules of mixing both red and blue colours (red molecules and blue molecules mixing together) or molecules of violet colour, secondary light 25 of violet colour and high frequency, which is very hard to obtain conventionally, can be easily generated according to the present invention.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it shall be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures.<br>
