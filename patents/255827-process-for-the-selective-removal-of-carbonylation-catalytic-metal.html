				<td>PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF CATALYTIC METALS AMP PROMOTER METALS FROM CARBONYLATION PROCESS STREAMS<br>
The present invention relates to the recovery of GroupVin carbonylation catalyst and/or promoter metals from process streams obtained in carbonylation processes. The production of carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof such as esters and anhydrides by the carbonylation of alcohols or reactive derivatives thereof in the presence of a Group Vm metal catalyst such as rhodium or iridium or mixtures thereof and a catalyst promoter is well known and is described, for example, in EP-A-0144935, EP-A-0643034 and US 6,211,405. Typically, where the catalyst is iridium the catalyst promoter may be selected from metals such as ruthenium, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, zinc, cadmium, indium, gallium and mercury as described, for example, in EP-A-0849248 and EP-A0643034. Where the catalyst is rhodium the catalyst promoter is typically lithium.<br>
Typically, in the operation of a carbonylation process, such as the production of acetic acid, the liquid reaction composition from the reactor is passed to one or more flash separation vessels wherein the catalyst components are separated from the more volatile components. The liquid fraction, containing the catalyst components is recycled to the reactor and the vapour fraction comprising acetic acid, methyl acetate and methyl iodide is passed to the purification section of the process. However, it has been found that a low level of catalyst and/or promoter metals may become entrained or contained in the vapour fraction and the metals are thus passed to the product purification section of the process from where they may be removed from the acetic acid product as a waste stream and ultimately disposed of.<br>
The catalyst and promoter metals are often expensive and significant cost advantages may be achieved by minimizing the loss of such metals from-the process, -<br><br>
Methods of removing metallic components from a carbonylation reaction product<br>
stream are known in the art US 6,627,770 describes the use of a resin comprising<br>
heterocyclic nitrogen-containing repeat units to sequester Group VIII metals from the<br>
product stream of a liquid phase, homogeneously-catalysed carbonylation reaction. In<br>
such a process, the vapour fraction emanating from the flash vessel is contacted with the<br>
aforementioned resin, which removes entrained or volatile Group "VTQ metals contained<br>
therein.	.	•	•<br>
US 6,329,435 describes the preparation of monodisperse, crosslinked bead polymers containing thiourea groups and their use for absorbing metal compound, in particular heavy metal compounds or noble metal compounds.<br>
EP-*A-1203777 describes a thiourea-functionalised resin for enhanced uptake of iron and rhodium from hydrogenafed nitrile rubber.<br>
EP-A-618185 discloses a process for the removal of corrosion metal contaminants<br>
from a liquid composition comprising a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid anhydride<br>
using a chelating resin.	;<br>
Thus there remains a need for a process for the recovery of catalyst and/or promoter metals from carbonylation process streams. In particular, it would be advantageous if the catalyst and/or promoter metals could be recovered in preference to other metals typically contained in carbonylation process streams such as corrosion metals and alkali metals added to aid product purification. Typically, the corrosion metals found in carbonylation process streams include iron, nickel, chromium and molybdenum.<br>
It has now been found that chelating resins having thiourea functional groups can be used to selectively remove Group VBI carbonylation catalyst metals and/or promoter metals from carbonylation process streams and, in particular to remove the catalyst metals in preference to corrosion metals contained in a carbonylation process stream.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the selective removal of Group Vin carbonylation catalyst metals and/or promoter metals from a liquid composition comprising a carbonylation product, at least one Group VIE carbonylation catalyst metal and/or promoter metal, corrosion metals and optionally alkali or alkaline earth metals which process comprises contacting said liquid composition with a chelating resin to remove at least a portion of the Group VIE carbonylation catalyst metal and/or promoter metal contained in the liquid composition and wherein the<br><br>
chelating resin comprises at least one thiourea functional group.<br>
Chelating resins have functional groups which attach to the metal to be removed. The chelating resins suitable for use in the process of the present invention have at least one thiourea functional group. The following chelating resin may be used in the process of the present invention:<br>
wherein P represents a chemical backbone.<br>
The chemical backbone maybe organic or inorganic. Suitably, the organic backbone may be a polymer backbone, for example polystyrene, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polyethylene or polypropylene, preferably polystyrene. The polymer backbone, such as polystyrene, may optionally be cross-linked, for example, with divinylbenzene, divinyl toluene and trivinylbenzene, especially divinylbenzene.<br>
The chelating resin may be macroporous, or may be of the gel-type. Macroreticular resins which comprise porous and interconnected gel phases resulting in a macroporous structure may also be employed.<br>
An example of a chelating thiourea-functionalised resin having a polymeric backbone suitable for use in the process of the present invention would be Lewatit TP214 (trademark) available from Sybron Chemicals.<br>
Chelating resins having an inorganic backbone may also be used. Examples of suitable inorganic backbones include silica, alumina, titania, ceria, zirconia clays and zeolites such as aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates.<br>
Chelating resins having backbones with inorganic and organic moieties may also be employed in the process of the present invention.<br>
Preferred chelating resins for use in the process of the present invention have a polymeric backbone.<br>
Treatment of the liquid composition is usually effected by passing the liquid composition through a fixed bed of the resin. The treatment of the liquid composition may be carried out as a batch, semi-continuous or continuous operation employing<br><br>
methods and techniques well known in the art of chelating resins. Continuous operation is preferred.<br>
The liquid composition may be contacted with the chelating resin at any suitable temperature above the freezing point of the liquid composition and below the temperature at which the resin and/or liquid composition exhibits unacceptable decomposition. Suitably, the process may be carried out at a temperature in the range 0 to 100°C, preferably in the range 5 to 80°C<br>
Pressure is not a critical variable and generally, atmospheric or pressures slightly above atmospheric pressure maybe employed. However, superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressures may be used if desired.<br>
The rate of flow (liquid hourly space velocity) of the liquid composition through a fixed bed of the chelating resin will, in general, be in the range 1 to 20 h"1, such as in the range 1 to 12 h"1.<br>
. The liquid composition to be treated by the process of the present invention may be treated in-situ or may be treated off-line.<br>
Contact of the liquid composition is ceased at or before the chelating resin has reached its capacity for the catalyst and promoter metals. The chelating resin may then be treated by any suitable means to recover the metals. Regeneration of the .chelating resin may be achieved by the methods recommended by the manufacturers.<br>
i<br>
More than one chelating jesin bed may be used such that whilst the liquid composition is being passed through one resin bed one or more other resin beds are being regenerated.<br>
Alternatively, the chelating resin may be subjected to a destructive process in order to recover the metals. Such destructive methods include combustion, pyrolysis or chemical decomposition of the resin. The resultant residue may be treated or digested with a suitable dissolving medium, such as a Bronsted acid, such that the catalyst and promoter metals are solubilised for recovery.<br>
The process of the present invention is particularly applicable to the removal of Group VIII carbonylation catalysts such as indium, rhodium and mixtures thereof and their associated promoter metals such as ruthenium, osmium, rhenium and mercury. from liquid compositions comprising corrosion metals typically found in carbonylation processes such as iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, zinc and molybdenum, particularly iron and nickel.<br><br>

The carbonylation product may be a carboxylic acid having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or carboxylic anhydride thereof and is preferably acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride.<br>
Typically, carbonylation processes operate at 100 —300° C and at elevated pressure (15 to 200 barg) with a partial pressure of carbon monoxide of 2-30 atmospheres and may be carried out in one or more reaction zones.<br>
In a typical liquid-phase carbonylation process to which the process of the present invention is applicable, liquid reaction composition is withdrawn from the one or more carbonylation reactors and passed to a flash zone at a pressure below that of the reactor(s) wherein with or without the addition of heat, a liquid fraction comprising the majority of the carbonylation catalyst and, if employed, the majority of the promoter, is separated from a vapour fraction comprising entrained or contained carbonylation catalyst and/or catalyst promoter species, carbonylation product, carbonylatable reactant, water and alkyl halide co-catalyst and non-condensable gases such as nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide; at least a portion of the liquid fraction is recycled to the carbonylation reactor(s) and the vapour fraction is passed to the product purification section which generally comprises one or more distillation zones. In a first distillation column (generally referred to as the light ends column) carbonylation product is separated from tfie light components (alkyl halide co-catalyst and unconverted reactant). The light components are removed overhead, and recycled to carbonylation reactpr(s). A crude carbonylation product stream is removed from the first distillation column and fed to one or more further distillation columns to obtain a carbonylation product of commercially acceptable quality. "Where the carbonylation product is a carboxylic acid, the crude carboxylic acid from the light ends column may be fed to a drying column to obtain a dry crude acid product which is then fed to a heavy ends distillation column to remove high boiling impurities such as propionic acid<br><br>
as bottoms from the column and to recover the carboxylic acid product. In some carboxylic acid processes, light ends removal and drying may be carried out in a single combined column.<br>
The amount of catalyst and/or promoter metal entering the product purification section will depend on various factors such as the carbonylation reaction conditions and also on the configuration of the carbonylation process equipment.<br>
The liquid composition to be treated according to the process of the present invention maybe derived from any process stream comprising carbonylation catalyst and/or promoter. Suitably, a liquid composition to. be treated according to the process of the present invention may be obtained from a distillation column stream such as from the base of a heavy ends column and/or from the base of a combined light ends and drying column and/or from a drying column.<br>
The process of the present invention may also be used to treat liquid compositions containing Group YD! carbonylation catalyst metals and/or promoter metals derived from gas phase (heterogeneous) carbonylation processes.<br>
