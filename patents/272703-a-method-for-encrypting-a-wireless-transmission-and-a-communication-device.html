September 23, 2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems,<br>
and more specifically to encryption of over-the-air communications in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a typical wireless communication system, a session key is distributed<br>
among the transmitting and receiving communication devices when a<br>
communication session is set up. The session key is then used by the transmitting<br>
communication to perform Layer 2 or Layer 3 encryption on data transmitted over-<br>
the-air. No physical layer, that is, Layer 1, encryption is performed, that is, there<br>
is no encryption of the modulated waveform. In addition, typically only the user<br>
data is encrypted and not the pilot symbols and synchronization symbols, which<br>
symbols must be used as a reference for timing synchronization and fading<br>
recovery.<br>
The performance of Layer 2 or Layer 3 encryption leaves the data<br>
vulnerable to decryption by an intercepting communication device that either<br>
intercepts the session key or that decrypts the data by application of brute force.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that makes an air interface<br><br>
more secure against decryption by an undesired interceptor of a communication in<br>
a wireless communication system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for a method and apparatus that makes an air interface<br>
more secure against decryption by an undesired interceptor of a communication in<br>
a wireless communication system, a communication device is provided that<br>
converts a bit stream to multiple symbols and provides encryption at a physical<br>
layer by shifting a phase of each symbol of the multiple symbols to produce<br>
multiple encrypted symbols. Each encrypted symbol of the multiple encrypted<br>
symbols is modulated with an orthogonal subcarrier to produce at least one<br>
modulated subcarrier and the at least one modulated subcarrier is then transmitted<br>
via a wireless link. On a receive side, a receiving communication device receives<br>
the transmitted, encrypted symbols and provides decryption at a physical layer by<br>
shifting a phase of each encrypted symbol in correspondence with the phase used<br>
to encrypt the symbol at the transmit side.<br>
Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method<br>
for encrypting a wireless transmission. The method includes receiving multiple<br>
symbols, shifting a phase of each symbol of the multiple symbols to produce<br>
multiple phase shifted symbols, modulating each phase shifted symbol of the<br>
multiple phase shifted symbols with an orthogonal subcarrier to produce at least<br>
one modulated subcarrier, and transmitting the at least one modulated subcarrier<br>
via a wireless link.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
receiving an encrypted wireless transmission. The method includes receiving at<br>
least one modulated subcarrier via a wireless link, demodulating the at least one<br>
modulated subcarrier to produce a plurality of encrypted symbols, and applying a<br>
phase shift to each encrypted symbol of the plurality of encrypted symbols to<br>
produce a plurality of decrypted symbols.<br><br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a<br>
communication device having a signal processing unit coupled to a transmitter<br>
section. The signal processing unit comprises a phase shifter that receives multiple<br>
symbols and applies a phase shift to each symbol of the multiple symbols to<br>
produce multiple phase shifted symbols. The signal processing unit further<br>
comprises an orthogonal modulator that receives the multiple phase shifted<br>
symbols and modulates each phase shifted symbol of the multiple phase shifted<br>
symbols with an orthogonal subcarrier to produce at least one modulated<br>
subcarrier. The transmitter section transmits the at least one modulated subcarrier<br>
via a wireless link.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a<br>
communication device having a signal processing unit that includes an orthogonal<br>
modulator and that is coupled to a transmitter section. The orthogonal modulator<br>
comprises a serial-to-parallel converter that assigns each symbol of the multiple<br>
symbols to a frequency sub-band of multiple frequency sub-bands to produce<br>
multiple assigned symbols and a phase shifter module that produces multiple phase<br>
shifted symbols, wherein the phase shifter module comprises multiple phase<br>
shifters and wherein each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters receives an<br>
assigned symbol of the multiple assigned symbols and shifts a phase of the<br>
assigned symbol to produce a phase shifted symbol. The orthogonal modulator<br>
further comprises a transformer that transforms each phase shifted symbol of the<br>
multiple phase shifted symbols to a time domain subcarrier associated with the<br>
symbol's frequency sub-band to produce multiple modulated time domain<br>
subcarriers, wherein the multiple modulated subcarriers are in a parallel form, and<br>
a parallel-to-serial converter that converts the multiple modulated subcarriers from<br>
a parallel form to a serial form to produce an output signal. The transmitter section<br>
transmits the multiple phase shifted symbols via a wireless link.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a<br>
communication device comprising a receiver section coupled to a signal<br>
processing unit. The receiver section receives a modulated carrier via a wireless<br><br>
link and downconverts the modulated carrier to produce a downconverted signal.<br>
The signal processing unit includes an orthogonal demodulator that receives the<br>
downconverted signal and demodulates the downconverted signal to produce a<br>
stream of encrypted symbols and a phase shifter that receives the stream of<br>
encrypted symbols and applies a phase shift to each symbol of the stream of<br>
encrypted symbols to produce a plurality of decrypted symbols.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a<br>
communication device comprising a receiver section coupled to a signal<br>
processing unit. The receiver section receives a modulated carrier via a wireless<br>
link and downconverts the modulated carrier to produce a downconverted signal.<br>
The signal processing unit includes an orthogonal modulator that comprises a<br>
serial-to-parallel converter that assigns the downconverted signal to multiple time<br>
domain subcarriers and an inverse transformer that transforms each time domain<br>
subcarrier of the multiple time domain subcarriers to a frequency domain<br>
subcarrier to produce multiple encrypted symbols, wherein the multiple encrypted<br>
symbols are in a parallel form. The signal processing unit further includes a phase<br>
shifter module that produces multiple decrypted symbols, wherein the phase shifter<br>
module comprises multiple phase shifters and wherein each phase shifter of the<br>
multiple phase shifters receives an encrypted symbol of the multiple encrypted<br>
symbols and shifts a phase of the encrypted symbol to produce a decrypted<br>
symbol, and a parallel-to-serial converter that converts the multiple decrypted<br>
symbols from a parallel form to a serial form to produce a stream of decrypted<br>
symbols.<br>
The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs.<br>
1-8. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 100 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Communications system<br>
100 includes a base transceiver station (BTS) 102 that is capable of engaging in<br>
wireless communications with a mobile station (MS) 110, such as a cellular<br>
telephone, radiotelephone, or wireless data modem, via an air interface 104. Air<br>
interface 104 includes a forward link 108 that comprises traffic, pilot, paging, and<br><br>
signaling channels. Air interface 104 further includes a reverse link 106 that<br>
comprises traffic, access, and signaling channels.<br>
Preferably, communication system 100 is an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system. OFDM is a wideband<br>
modulation scheme that divides a frequency bandwidth allocated for a<br>
communication session into multiple narrower frequency sub-bands. Each sub-<br>
band includes a radio frequency (RF) subcarrier, wherein each subcarrier is<br>
mathematically orthogonal to the RF subcarrier included in each of the other<br>
subchannels. The orthogonality of the subcarriers allows their individual spectra to<br>
overlap without causing interference with the other carriers. However, those who<br>
are of ordinary skill in the art realize that communication system 100 may operate<br>
in accordance with any wireless telecommunication system that uses an orthogonal<br>
modulation scheme for modulation of information onto a carrier and subsequent<br>
transmission of the modulated signal, such as a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) communication system, a CDMA 2000 communication system, a<br>
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication system, or a Wideband<br>
CDMA (WCDMA) communication system. In CDMA, the subcarriers are not of<br>
different frequency but of different code domain. They are called Walsh codes in<br>
IS2000, and in UMTS they are called Orthogonal Vector Spreading Factors<br>
(OVSF).<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an architecture of communication system 100<br>
in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. On a transmit side of<br>
communications system 100, a transmitting communication device 202, such as<br>
BTS 102, receives a bit stream, converts the bit stream to a corresponding symbol<br>
stream, provides encryption at a physical layer by encrypting the symbol stream to<br>
produce an encrypted symbol stream, and transmits the encrypted symbol stream<br>
via an air interface, such as air interface 104. On a receive side of communications<br>
system 100, a receiving communication device 250, such as MS 110, receives the<br>
transmitted, encrypted symbol stream and provides decryption at a physical layer<br>
by decrypting the received symbols to recover the bits of the transmitted bit stream<br><br>
corresponding to each received data symbol. However, those who are of ordinary<br>
skill in the art realize that BTS 102 and MS 110 are each capable of operating as<br>
either a transmitting communication device or a receiving communication device<br>
with respect to the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Each of transmitting communication device 202 and receiving<br>
communication device 250 includes a respective signal processing unit 204, 270,<br>
such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors<br>
(DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Each of transmitting communication device 202 and<br>
receiving communication device 250 further includes a respective at least one<br>
memory device 240, 290 associated with the respective signal processing unit,<br>
such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory<br>
(DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that maintains<br>
data and programs that may be executed by the signal processing unit and that<br>
allow the signal processing unit to operate in communication system 100. Each of<br>
transmitting communication device 202 and receiving communication device 250<br>
further maintains in their respective at least one memory device 240, 290 a session<br>
key that is exchanged by the transmitting and receiving communication devices<br>
during a set up of a communication session between the two devices as is know in<br>
the art. Each of transmitting communication device 202 and receiving<br>
communication device 250 may further maintain, in their respective at least one<br>
memory device 240, 290, a mobile serial number that is uniquely associated with<br>
MS 110. As those who are of ordinary skill in the art are aware, the various<br>
functions of signal processing units 204, 270 as described herein may alternatively<br>
be implemented in hardware circuitry, such as a programmable logic array (PLA)<br>
or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a logic flow diagram 300 is depicted that<br>
illustrates an operation of transmit side 202 in communication system 100 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow 300 begins<br>
(302) when a data source (not shown) provides input data in a binary format, such<br><br>
as bits, to an encoder 206. Encoder 206 encodes (304) the bit stream by applying<br>
an error correcting code, such as a forward error correction code (FEC), to the<br>
data. For example, encoder 206 may encode the data by use of a convolutional<br>
code such as a Viterbi coding algorithm, however, a block code may be used.<br>
Convolutional codes and block codes are well known in the art and will not be<br>
described in greater detail. The type of error correcting code used is not critical to<br>
the invention and those of ordinary skill in the art are aware of many types of error<br>
correction codes that may be applied to the data without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention. Regardless, the output of encoder 206 includes<br>
information preferably represented in a binary data (bits) format. A bit stream<br>
output by encoder 206 is then provided to a symbol mapper 208.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the input data<br>
includes multiple data-types, such as user data, pilot data, and synchronization<br>
data, only the user data is encoded and the one or more other data-types, that is, the<br>
pilot data and the synchronization data, is not encoded. In such an embodiment,<br>
symbol mapper 208 may comprise multiple symbol mappers, wherein the user data<br>
is encoded before being provided to a first symbol mapper of the multiple symbol<br>
mappers and the other data-types are each directly conveyed to a respective other<br>
symbol mapper of the multiple symbol mappers.<br>
Symbol mapper 208, or each of the multiple symbol mappers when symbol<br>
mapper 208 comprises multiple symbol mappers, groups the bit stream received by<br>
the symbol mapper into groups of P bits (P-tuples) and maps (306) each P-tuple to<br>
a corresponding symbol to produce a symbol stream. To this end, a signal<br>
constellation that includes M possible symbols is defined within a multi-<br>
dimensional space, preferably a complex two-dimensional (I,Q) space. Each<br>
symbol comprises a point within the two-dimensional space, which point may be<br>
represented as a vector sum of two scaled basis vectors T and 'Q'. The respective<br>
amplitudes of the two basis vectors used to define a particular point may be<br>
thought of as two-dimensional coordinates of the point. In order to achieve the<br>
desired mapping, symbol mapper 208 assembles the binary values (bits) output by<br><br>
encoder 204 into a P-tuple. Each P-tuple is then used to select a symbol out of the<br>
M possible symbols, wherein M = 2P. In one embodiment, a MPSK modulation<br>
scheme, such as BPSK or QPSK, is applied to each P-tuple; however those who<br>
are of ordinary skill in the art realize that there are many types of multi-<br>
dimensional symbol mapping schemes, such as other MPSK schemes or a multiple<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) scheme, that may be used without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Communication system 200 may further include an interleaving block on<br>
transmit side 202 that interleaves the symbols produced by the symbol mapper 208<br>
in order to minimize the error producing impact of a bursty channel. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, block interleaving may be used wherein the<br>
symbol stream is read into the rows of a two-dimensional matrix and read out<br>
column-wise, resulting in the separation of any two adjacent symbols in the<br>
symbol stream. When the transmitted symbols are received and deinterleaved by<br>
the inverse interleaving block, any error bursts introduced by the channel are<br>
broken up, reducing the impact of the error and augmenting the ability of the<br>
forward error correction code to correct such errors.<br>
Symbol mapper 208 conveys the symbol stream to a phase shifter 210.<br>
Phase shifter 210 then encrypts (308) each symbol received by the phase shifter by<br>
shifting a phase of the symbol to produce an encrypted, phase shifted symbol.<br>
Signal processing unit 204 determines the phase shift based on a code word '9'<br>
output by a code word generator 212 coupled to phase shifter 210. Preferably, the<br>
code word is derived from one or more of the session key exchanged by transmit<br>
side 202 and receive side 250 when the communication session is set up and the<br>
mobile serial number that is uniquely associated with MS 110.<br>
When the communication session between transmitting communication<br>
device 202 and receiving communication device 250 is set up, signal processing<br>
units 204 initializes code word generator 212 by inputting the session key,<br>
typically a string of bits, or a string of bits derived from the session key, and/or the<br><br>
mobile serial number, or a string of bits derived from the mobile serial number,<br>
into code word generator 212. In correspondence with each symbol input into<br>
amplitude and phase adjuster 210, amplitude and phase adjuster 210 reads bits of<br>
the output of code word generator 212. Signal processing unit 204 then<br>
determines a phase shift based on the read bits.<br>
As is known in the art, data is transmitted over the air in groupings known<br>
as frames. After the communication session is set up, each time transmit side 202<br>
starts a new frame, signal processing unit 204 re-initializes code word generator<br>
212 so that the first, in time, symbols encrypted for embedding in the new frame<br>
are encrypted based on the re-initialized code word generator 212. The header of<br>
the new frame includes a New Frame Indicator (NFI), indicating that this is a new<br>
frame, and the NFI indicates to receiving communication device 250 that the<br>
receiving communication device should re-initialize its code word generator as<br>
well. Thus synchronization is maintained between the code word generators of<br>
transmit side 202 and receive side 250.<br>
Phase shifter 210 conveys the stream of encrypted, phase shifted symbols to<br>
an orthogonal modulator 214. When symbol mapper 208 comprises multiple<br>
symbol mappers that each maps a data-type of multiple data-types to a<br>
constellation of symbols, only the symbol mapper that produces a symbol stream<br>
based on user data conveys the produced symbol stream to phase shifter 210.<br>
Phase shifter 210 then shifts a phase of each symbol associated with user data to<br>
produce a stream of encrypted, that is, phase shifted, symbols that is conveyed to<br>
orthogonal modulator 214. Each of the other symbol mappers, which produces a<br>
symbol stream based associated with non-user data, bypasses phase shifter 210 and<br>
conveys the non-encrypted, that is, non-shifted, symbol stream directly to<br>
orthogonal modulator 214.<br>
Orthogonal Modulator 214 modulates each symbol received by the<br>
orthogonal modulator with an orthogonal subcarrier, such as one of multiple<br>
frequency sub-bands in an OFDM communication system or an orthogonal code or<br><br>
OVSF in a CDMA communication system. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, an OFDM embodiment, orthogonal modulator 214 comprises a serial-<br>
to-parallel (S/P) converter 216 coupled to a transformer 218, which transformer is<br>
further coupled to a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 220. In response to receiving<br>
each symbol, orthogonal modulator 214 routes the received symbol to S/P<br>
converter 216. S/P converter 216 assigns (310) each symbol to one of multiple<br>
('N') orthogonal subcarriers, that is, frequency sub-bands, in effect converting the<br>
symbol stream received from phase shifter 210 from a serial to a parallel form and<br>
producing N parallel symbols, wherein N is the number of subcarriers contained in<br>
a frequency bandwidth allocated for a communication session. S/P converter 216<br>
then applies the N parallel symbols to transformer 218. When the symbols received<br>
by orthogonal modulator 214 are associated with multiple data types, such as user<br>
data, pilot data, and synchronization data, S/P converter 216 assigns each symbol<br>
associated with a same data-type to an orthogonal subcarrier from a same set of<br>
one or more orthogonal subcarriers. That is, the symbols associated with user data<br>
may be assigned to one or more orthogonal subcarriers from a first set orthogonal<br>
subcarriers, the symbols associated with pilot data may be assigned to one or more<br>
orthogonal subcarriers from a second set of orthogonal subcarriers, and the<br>
symbols associated with synchronization data may be assigned to one or more<br>
orthogonal subcarriers from a third set of orthogonal subcarriers.<br>
Transformer 218 transforms (312) each symbol of the N parallel symbols,<br>
which symbol is assigned to a frequency sub-band, that is, a frequency domain<br>
subcarrier, to a time domain signal, that is, a time domain subcarrier, thereby<br>
producing multiple (N) modulated orthogonal time domain subcarriers, wherein<br>
each subcarrier corresponds to a sub-band included in the frequency band. The<br>
multiple orthogonal frequency sub-bands f„(t), n = 0, 1, ... , N-l can be thought of<br>
as sinusoids or complex exponentials of the form e^00™'1" for t e [0, Ttotai] where<br>
W is the available frequency bandwidth and W/N expresses the frequency spacing<br>
between subcarriers.<br><br>
As known in OFDM systems, the functionality of transformer 218 may be<br>
implemented with an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), or alternatively with<br>
an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). The N parallel symbols are provided<br>
as input to the IFFT and the IFFT outputs N parallel time domain subcarriers of<br>
frequency f„, wherein each subcarrier of the N parallel subcarriers is modulated by<br>
a corresponding input symbol of the N parallel input symbols. The modulated time<br>
domain subcarriers constituting the IFFT output are then conveyed to P/S<br>
converter 220.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, phase shifter 210 may<br>
comprise a phase shifter module that is interposed between S/P converter 216 and<br>
transformer 218 instead of preceding the S/P converter. In such an embodiment,<br>
phase shifter 210 may comprise multiple phase shifters, PSi-PSN, wherein each<br>
phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters is associated with, and receives from S/<br>
P converter 216, a symbol of the multiple ('N') parallel symbols output by the S/P<br>
converter. Each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters PSI-PSN is further<br>
associated with a corresponding one of the multiple ('N') frequency sub-bands. In<br>
conjunction with each set of 'N' parallel symbols received by the multiple phase<br>
shifters PSi-PSN, each such phase shifter receives a code word 0 produced by code<br>
word generator 212 that is different from the code word provided to the other<br>
phase shifters of the multiple phase shifters PSI-PSN. In response to receiving a<br>
symbol and a code word, each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters PSi-PSN<br>
encrypts the symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol, which phase shift is based<br>
on the code word, to produce an encrypted, phase shifted symbol. Each phase<br>
shifter PSI-PSN then applies the phase shifted symbol to transformer 218 for<br>
transformation from a corresponding frequency sub-band, that is, a frequency<br>
domain subcarrier, to a corresponding time domain signal, that is, a time domain<br>
subcarrier.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention wherein symbol mapper 208<br>
comprises multiple symbol mappers that each maps a different data-type to a<br>
constellation of symbols, only the assigned symbols output by S/P converter 216<br><br>
that are associated with user data are conveyed to one of the multiple phase shifters<br>
PSrPSN. The other assigned symbols bypass phase shifter 210 and are conveyed<br>
by S/P converter 216 directly to transformer 218. Each phase shifter of multiple<br>
phase shifters PSI-PSN receives an assigned symbol associated with the user data<br>
and shifts a phase of the symbol to produce a phase shifted symbol that is<br>
conveyed to transformer 218. Transformer 218 then transforms each phase shifted<br>
symbol received from a phase shifter PSI-PSN from a corresponding frequency<br>
sub-band, that is, a frequency domain subcarrier, to a corresponding time domain<br>
signal, that is, a time domain subcarrier, to produce a modulated time domain<br>
subcarrier associated with the user data. Transformer 218 further transforms each<br>
non-phase shifted symbol received directly from S/P converter 216 from a<br>
corresponding frequency sub-band, that is, a frequency domain subcarrier, to a<br>
corresponding time domain signal, that is, a time domain subcarrier, to produce a<br>
modulated time domain subcarrier associated with the non-user data. The<br>
modulated time domain subcarriers resulting from the transformation of the<br>
multiple phase shifted and non-phase shifted symbols are then conveyed to P/S<br>
converter 220.<br>
P/S converter 220, preferably a multiplexer, converts (314) the time domain<br>
subcarriers received from transformer 218 from a parallel form to a serial form to<br>
produce a first output signal. P/S converter 220 conveys the first output signal to a<br>
cyclic prefix (C/P) adder 222 that appends (318) a guard band interval, or cyclic<br>
prefix, to the first output signal to produce a second output signal. Typically, the<br>
appending of a cyclic prefix comprises an appending of the last Tg seconds of each<br>
OFDM symbol as a prefix to itself. Preferably Tg is a preassigned length of 16<br>
taps, or 0.8us; however, those of ordinary skill in the art realize that the<br>
preassigned length of the cyclic prefix is up to the designer of the system as the<br>
designer weighs the greater protection afforded by a longer cyclic prefix against<br>
the inefficiency of a longer prefix. C/P adder 222 conveys the second output<br>
signal to a transmitter section 230 of transmit side 202 that is coupled to signal<br>
processing unit 204. Transmitter section 230 includes a modulator 232 coupled to<br>
an amplifier 234. Transmitter section 230 routes the second output signal to<br><br>
modulator 232. Modulator 232 upconverts (320) the second output signal from a<br>
baseband frequency to a transmit frequency to produce an upconverted signal. The<br>
upconverted signal is conveyed to power amplifier (PA) 234 that amplifies (322)<br>
the signal to produce an amplified signal and transmits (324) the amplified signal<br>
via an antenna 236 and air interface 104. Logic flow 300 then ends (326).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a CDMA embodiment,<br>
orthogonal modulator 214 may comprise at least one spreader instead of an S/P<br>
converter, transformer, and P/S converter. In such an embodiment, the at least one<br>
spreader spreads (316) the phase shifted symbol received from phase shifter 210<br>
by an orthogonal spreading code, that is, a CDMA subcarrier, to produce the first<br>
output signal, that is, a stream of modulated, that is, spread, symbols. For example,<br>
orthogonal modulator 214 may comprise multiple serial spreaders, wherein one<br>
spreader of the multiple spreaders spreads each symbol with a long code and<br>
another spreader of the multiple spreaders spreads the symbol with a Walsh code<br>
or an OVSF. When the symbols conveyed to orthogonal modulator 214 comprises<br>
symbols associated with multiple data-types, the orthogonal modulator spreads<br>
each received symbol by an orthogonal spreading code assigned to the<br>
corresponding data-type to produce a modulated subcarrier. The spread symbols<br>
are then conveyed to transmitter section 230. That is, the symbols associated with<br>
user data may be spread by a first one or more orthogonal subcarriers, that is,<br>
spreading codes, the symbols associated with pilot data may be spread by a second<br>
one or more orthogonal subcarriers, and the symbols associated with<br>
synchronization data may be spread by a third one or more orthogonal subcarriers.<br>
In the CDMA embodiment, signal processing unit 204 may or may not include C/P<br>
adder 222 interposed between orthogonal modulator 214 and transmitter section<br>
230, which C/P adder may add a prefix to the stream of spread symbols output by<br>
the orthogonal modulator.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 4 and 5, an operation of code word generator 212 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4 is a<br>
block diagram of code word generator 212 in accordance with an embodiment of<br><br>
the present invention. FIG. 5 is a logic flow diagram 500 illustrating a method by<br>
which code word generator 212 generates the code word '0' used by phase shifter<br>
210 to shift a phase of the symbol received by the phase shifter in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Logic flow diagram 500 begins (502) when a circular buffer 414 of code<br>
word generator 212 is loaded (504) with a bit sequence that is used to produce the<br>
code word '8.' Circular buffer 514 is initially loaded when the communication<br>
session is set up and is reloaded each time transmitting communication device 202<br>
starts a new frame. That is, as is known in the art, data is transmitted in frames.<br>
Each time a new frame is assembled by signal processing unit 204, the signal<br>
processing unit re-initializes circular buffer 414 so that the first, in time, symbols<br>
encrypted for embedding in the new frame are encrypted based on the re-initialized<br>
circular buffer. The header of the new frame includes a New Frame Indicator<br>
(NFI), indicating that this is a new frame, and the NFI indicates to receiving<br>
communication device 250 that the receiving communication device should re-<br>
initialize its circular buffer as well. Thus synchronization is maintained between<br>
the code word generators of the transmitting and receiving communication devices<br>
202, 250.<br>
Preferably, circular buffer 414 is loaded with a bit sequence as follows.<br>
Signal processing unit 204 provides, and combiner 410 receives a first encryption<br>
key 402. Preferably first encryption key 402 is a dynamic, 16 bit key that is valid<br>
only for the duration of the call or for a single packet burst, such as a 16 bit key<br>
that is derived from a session key exchanged by transmitting communication<br>
device 202 and receiving communication device 250 during set up of the<br>
communication session and maintained in the at least one memory device 240. In<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, first encryption key 402 may be<br>
conveyed to combiner 410 via a mixer 406, where the first encryption key is<br>
spread by a first spreading code 404 that is maintained in each of the at least one<br>
memory devices 240, 290 of each of transmitting communication device 202 and<br><br>
receiving communication device 250. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, first encryption key 402 may be conveyed directly to combiner 410.<br>
Signal processing unit 204 further provides, and combiner 410 receives, a<br>
second encryption key 408. Preferably second encryption key 408 is a static, 48<br>
bit key that is unique to MS 110, such as a mobile serial number, for example an<br>
Electronic Serial Number (ESN), uniquely associated with the MS and is<br>
maintained in the at least one memory device 240 of transmitting communication<br>
device 202.<br>
Combiner 410 combines the received first encryption key 402 and the<br>
received second encryption key 408 to produce a first code word 412 for input into<br>
circular buffer 414. Preferably code word 412 is 64 bits long, wherein the 16 most<br>
significant bits are derived from first encryption key 402 and the remaining 48 bits<br>
are derived from second encryption key 408. However, one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art realizes the algorithm used to combine first encryption key 402 and second<br>
encryption key 408 is not critical to the present invention and that any of a variety<br>
of algorithms may be used by combiner 410 to combine the first encryption key<br>
and the second encryption key without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention. Combiner 410 may further comprise a concatenation function<br>
that concatenates one or more of first encryption key 402, second encryption key<br>
408, or the combination of the first encryption key and the second encryption key,<br>
in order to produce a code word of a desired length, that is, a length appropriate for<br>
circular buffer 414. In another embodiment of the present invention, code word<br>
412 may be derived from only one of first encryption key 402 or second<br>
encryption key 404, which key may be provided directly to circular buffer 414 or<br>
may be provided to the circular buffer via one or more of a concatenation function<br>
and a spreader, or multiplier.<br>
Circular buffer 414 converts first code word 412 to circular serial data.<br>
Preferably, circular buffer 414 is a shift left register, with the most significant bit<br>
(MSB) serialized first and the least significant bit (LSB) serialized last. Each time<br><br>
an MSB is read out of buffer 414, the buffer is sifted one position to the left and<br>
the MSB is loaded back into the buffer as a LSB. As a result, when the code word<br>
stored in the buffer reaches the LSB of the initially stored code word, the sequence<br>
will continue again with the MSB of the initially stored code word.<br>
A serial sequence is then read out (506) of circular buffer 414 and is routed<br>
to a code word expander 416 coupled to the buffer. Code word expander 416<br>
expands (508) the serial sequence read out of circular buffer 414 to create a<br>
second, longer code word 418 of 128 bits from the 64 bit code word stored in<br>
circular buffer 414. Preferably, code word expander 416 is a one-half (¥£)<br>
convolutional encoder that is known in the art and is defined in Section 8.2.1.2.1.3<br>
of the IEEE 802.16 standard. A one-half convolutional encoder adds redundancy<br>
to the serial sequence read out of buffer 414 to produce second code word 418 of<br>
128 bits from a 64 bit code word stored in circular buffer 414.<br>
Code word expander 416 conveys second code word 418 to an Exclusive<br>
OR (XOR) gate 422. However, in another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
when the serial sequence read out of buffer 414 may be of a size that does not<br>
require expansion, code word generator may not include code word expander 416.<br>
In such an embodiment, the serial sequence read out of circular buffer 414 may be<br>
routed directly to Exclusive OR (XOR) gate 422. In addition to receiving code<br>
word 418, XOR gate 422 further receives a random or pseudo-noise (PN) sequence<br>
420. XOR gate 420 XOR's (510) code word 418 with sequence 420 produce a<br>
third code word 424. By XOR'ing code word 418 with sequence 420, the code<br>
word '0' provided by code word generator 212 to phase shifter 210 is further<br>
randomized, thereby making the phase shift introduced by the phase shifter even<br>
harder to detect. Preferably sequence 420 is a pilot sequence that is used to spread<br>
a pilot signal, such as a pilot sequence defined by Section 8.3.3.4.2 or Section<br>
8.4.9.4.1 of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Such pilot sequences typically comprise the<br>
properties of a good random sequence. However, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
realizes that any random or PN sequence may be used here.<br><br>
XOR gate 422 conveys third code word 424 to a serial-to-parallel (S/P)<br>
buffer 426 that buffers (512) the code word. Signal processing unit 204 then reads<br>
(514) the code word out of S/P buffer 426 and routes the read code word 430 to a<br>
multiplier 434. In conjunction with each reading of the code word out of buffer<br>
426, the multiplier further receives a subcarrier index 432 of multiple subcarrier<br>
indices, wherein each subcarrier index of the multiple subcarrier indices<br>
corresponds to a subcarrier of the multiple ('N') subcarriers. Multiplier 434 then<br>
multiplies (516) each code word 430 read out of buffer 426 by a subcarrier index<br>
432 to produce a code word 436 that is associated with a subcarrier of the multiple<br>
('N') subcarriers. By multiplying each code word received by multiplier 434 by a<br>
different subcarrier index value, which subcarrier index value is associated with a<br>
subcarrier assigned to the symbol that will be phase shifted based on the code<br>
word, code word generator 212 is able to introduce a phase shift to each symbol of<br>
the 'N' parallel symbols that is different from the phase shift introduced to the<br>
other symbols of the 'N' parallel symbols. This further increases the difficulty for<br>
an intercepting communication device to decrypt the encrypted symbols.<br>
For example, when phase shifter 210 comprises a phase shifter module that<br>
is interposed between S/P converter 216 and transformer 218, multiplier 434 may<br>
multiply a first code word output by S/P buffer 426 by a first subcarrier index 432.<br>
The resulting codeword is then conveyed to a first phase shifter PSi of the multiple<br>
phase shifters PSi-PSN. Multiplier 434 may then multiply the same code word,<br>
again output by S/P buffer 426, by a second subcarrier index 432 and convey the<br>
resulting codeword to a second phase shifter PS2 (not shown) of the multiple phase<br>
shifters PSI-PSN, and so on. Thus each code word conveyed to each phase shifter<br>
PSI-PSN is different than the code words conveyed to the other phase shifters.<br>
However, in another embodiment of the present invention and in order to reduce<br>
the complexity of code word generator 212, multiplier 434 may not be included in<br>
the code word generator and the code words 430 read out of buffer 426 may not be<br>
multiplied by corresponding subcarrier index values.<br><br>
Multiplier 434 then conveys each code word 436 to truncation function<br>
438. Truncation function 438 truncates (518) each code word 436 to produce a<br>
truncated code word, which truncated code word is the code word '8' provided to<br>
phase shifter 210. The length of code word '0' is up to a designer of<br>
communication system 100 and should be a length appropriate for a level of<br>
granularity desired by the designer of communication system 100 for the phase<br>
shift introduced by phase shifter 210. Preferably, code word '0' is eight (8) bits;<br>
however one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that '8' may be any length. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, a length of each code word 430 read<br>
out of S/P buffer 426, or produced by multiplier 434, may be of a length<br>
appropriate for code word '8.' In such an embodiment, code word generator 212<br>
may not include truncation function 438 as the code word may not need to be<br>
truncated to produce code word '0.' Logic flow diagram 500 then ends (520).<br>
Phase shifter 210 then uses the code word '0' to apply a phase shift to the<br>
symbol received by the phase shifter from symbol mapper 208. Referring now to<br>
FIGs. 6 and 7, an operation of a phase shifter 600, such as phase shifter 210, or<br>
when phase shifter 210 comprises multiple phase shifters PSi-PSN, each phase<br>
shifter of the multiple phase shifters PSi-PSN, is illustrated in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 is a block diagram of phase shifter<br>
600 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7 is a logic<br>
flow diagram 700 illustrating a method executed by phase shifter 600 to implement<br>
a phase shift in the symbol received by the phase shifter in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Logic flow diagram 700 begins (702) when phase shifter 600 receives (704)<br>
a code word '0' from code word generator 212. Phase shifter 600 routes the<br>
received code word to a sine and cosine function generator 602. Based on the<br>
received code word, sine and cosine function generator 602 generates (706) a first<br>
value corresponding to a sine function 'sin a' and a second value corresponding to<br>
a cosine function 'cos a,' wherein 'a' is an angle corresponding to the code word<br>
'0' received from code word generator 212. For example, when '8' is an 'n' bit<br><br>
code word, then a = C x (36072"), wherein C corresponds to the value represented<br>
by the code word '9.' For example, suppose '8' is an eight (8) bit code word.<br>
Further, suppose that the code word '0' sourced by code word generator 212 to<br>
phase shifter 210 is '10001001.' This code word corresponds to a value of 137,<br>
and a is then equal to '137 x (3607256),' or approximately 192°. Sine and cosine<br>
function generator 602 then generates a first value corresponding to a sine of 192°<br>
and generates a second value corresponding to a cosine of 192°. Preferably, sine<br>
and cosine function generator 602 generates the values corresponding to 'sin a'<br>
and 'cos a' by reference to a lookup table maintained by at least one memory<br>
device 240. Sine and cosine function generator 602 then routes the first and<br>
second values, that is, 'sin a' and 'cos a,' to a quadrature encryptor 604.<br>
Quadrature encryptor 604 receives the first and second values, that is, 'sin<br>
a' and 'cos a,' from sine and cosine function generator 602. Quadrature encryptor<br>
604 further receives (708) a symbol (Iin,Qin) produced by symbol mapper 208.<br>
Quadrature encryptor 604 then shifts (710) a phase of the symbol based on the 'sin<br>
a' and 'cos a' received from sine and cosine function generator 602 to produce an<br>
encrypted, phase shifted symbol (IOUt,Qout). More particularly, quadrature encryptor<br>
604 produces phase shifted symbol (Iom,Qout) by executing the following formulas<br>
maintained in at least one memory device 240:<br>
Iom = (Iin x cos a) - (Qm x sin a), and<br>
Qout = (Iin x sin a) + (Qi„ x cos a).<br>
The phase shifted symbol (Iout,Qout) is then conveyed by phase shifter 600 to an<br>
orthogonal modulator, such as orthogonal modulator 214, or to a transformer, such<br>
as transformer 218, whichever is appropriate, and logic flow diagram 700 then<br>
ends (712).<br>
The receive side 250 of communication system 100 implements the reverse<br>
functions with respect to the transmit side 202. Referring now to FIG. 8, a logic<br>
flow diagram 800 is depicted that illustrates an operation of receive side 250 in<br><br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow 800 begins<br>
(802) when a signal received via an antenna 252 is routed to a receiver section<br>
260, where a low noise amplifier (LNA) 262 amplifies (804) the received signal.<br>
LNA 262 then routes the amplified signal to a demodulator 264 that downconverts<br>
(806) the amplified signal from a transmit frequency to a baseband frequency. The<br>
baseband signal is then conveyed to the receive side signal processing unit 270.<br>
Signal processing unit 270 routes the baseband signal to a cyclic prefix (C/<br>
P) remover 272 that removes (808) a cyclic prefix that had been appended to the<br>
signal. C/P remover 272 conveys the cyclic prefix-less signal to orthogonal<br>
demodulator 274. When the corresponding transmit side 202 does not include a C/<br>
P adder, then signal processing unit 270 may route the baseband signal directly to<br>
orthogonal demodulator 274. Orthogonal demodulator 274 performs an inverse<br>
function to the function performed by orthogonal modulator 214. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, an OFDM embodiment, orthogonal<br>
demodulator 274 comprises an S/P converter 276 coupled to an inverse<br>
transformer 278, which inverse transformer is further coupled to a P/S converter<br>
280. In such an embodiment, orthogonal demodulator 274 routes the cyclic prefix-<br>
less signal to S/P converter 276. S/P converter 276 converts (810) the<br>
downconverted, prefix-less signal from a serial to a parallel form, outputting N<br>
parallel modulated subcarriers. The N parallel modulated subcarriers are conveyed<br>
to inverse transformer 278, such as a discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or a fast<br>
Fourier Transform (FFT), that transforms (812) each subcarrier of the N parallel<br>
modulated subcarriers from a time domain to a frequency domain based upon a<br>
corresponding orthogonal function of the N orthogonal functions used in<br>
transformer 218. That is, inverse transformer 278 transforms each encrypted<br>
symbol to a frequency domain sub-band, or subcarrier, associated with the<br>
symbol's time domain subcarrier to produce multiple encrypted symbols. The<br>
output of inverse transformer 278 includes 'N' parallel encrypted symbols based<br>
on the 'N' modulated subcarriers, wherein each symbol of the 'N' parallel<br>
encrypted symbols is drawn from the 'M' possible symbols of the constellation<br>
used on the transmit side 202.<br><br>
Transformer 278 conveys the 'N' parallel encrypted symbols to a P/S<br>
converter 280. P/S converter 280 converts (814) the 'N' parallel encrypted<br>
symbols from a parallel form to a serial form to produce a stream of encrypted<br>
symbols and conveys the symbol stream to a phase shifter 282. Phase shifter 282<br>
decrypts (818) each encrypted symbol in the symbol stream by shifting a phase of<br>
the encrypted symbol in compensation for the phase shift added to the symbol by<br>
phase shifter 210, thereby producing multiple decrypted symbols. Phase shifter<br>
282 then conveys each decrypted symbol to an inverse symbol mapper 286.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the transmitted<br>
data includes multiple data-types, such as user data, pilot data, and synchronization<br>
data, and only the user data is encrypted by a transmit side phase shifter, then only<br>
the symbols associated with the user data are conveyed by orthogonal demodulator<br>
to phase shifter 282. Phase shifter 282 decrypts each encrypted symbol, that is, the<br>
symbols associated with the user data, by shifting a phase of the encrypted symbol<br>
in compensation for the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210 to<br>
produce a stream of decrypted symbols that is conveyed to inverse symbol mapper<br>
286. The symbols associated with me non-user data-types are not encrypted by the<br>
transmit side and therefore are in a non-encrypted format, that is, comprise a<br>
stream of non-encrypted symbols, when output by P/S converter 280. The non-<br>
encrypted symbols may then be used for synchronization and pilot interpolation<br>
purposes, whichever is appropriate, and may be discarded without being conveyed<br>
to inverse symbol mapper 286.<br>
Phase shifter 282 implements the phase shift of each encrypted symbol<br>
based on a same code word as the code word used to determine a phase shift in<br>
phase shifter 210, which code word is generated by a code word generator 284<br>
coupled to phase shifter 282. For example, in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, phase shifter 282 may subtract, from the phase of the symbol, a phase<br>
equivalent to the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, phase shifter 282 may add a phase to the<br><br>
symbol that will complete a 360° rotation of the symbol around the complex plane,<br>
that is, may apply a phase shift approximately equal to '360° - 0'. For example, if<br>
phase shifter 210 applied a 192° phase shift to the symbol, then phase shifter 282<br>
may apply a phase shift of approximately '360° - 192°,' or 168°, to the symbol.<br>
Code word generator 284 outputs code words that are synchronized with<br>
the code words output by code word generator 212. When the communication<br>
session between transmitting communication device 202 and receiving<br>
communication device 270 is first set up, signal processing unit 274 initializes<br>
code word generator 284 by inputting the session key, or a string of bits derived<br>
from the session key, and/or the mobile serial number, or a string of bits derived<br>
from the mobile serial number, into the code word generator. After the<br>
communication session is set up, each time receiving communication device 270<br>
receives a new frame, signal processing unit 274 re-initializes code word generator<br>
284 so that the first, in time, symbols decrypted from the new frame are decrypted<br>
based on the re-initialized code word generator.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, phase shifter 282 may<br>
comprise a phase shifter module that is interposed between inverse transformer<br>
278 and P/S converter 280 instead of succeeding the P/S converter. In such an<br>
embodiment, phase shifter 282, similar to phase shifter 210, may comprise<br>
multiple phase shifters, PSI-PSN, wherein each phase shifter of the multiple phase<br>
shifters is associated with, and receives from inverse transformer 278, an encrypted<br>
symbol of the multiple ('N') parallel symbols output by the inverse transformer.<br>
Each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters PSi-PSN is further associated with<br>
a corresponding one of the multiple ('N') subcarriers. In conjunction with each set<br>
of 'N' parallel symbols received by the multiple phase shifters PSi-PSN, each phase<br>
shifter PSi-PSN receives a code word '6" produced by code word generator 284<br>
that is different from the code word provided to the other phase shifters PSI-PSN.<br>
In response to receiving a symbol and a code word, each phase shifter PSi-PSN<br>
decrypts the symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol based on the code word to<br>
produce a decrypted symbol. Each phase shifter PSi-PSN then applies the<br><br>
decrypted symbol to P/S converter 280 for conversion from a parallel form to a<br>
serial form.<br>
When the transmitted data includes multiple data-types, such as user data,<br>
pilot data, and synchronization data, only the encrypted symbols, that is, the<br>
symbols associated with the user data and which symbols are phase shifted by the<br>
transmit side, are conveyed by inverse transformer 278 to P/S converter 280 via a<br>
corresponding phase shifter PSI-PSN. The non-encrypted symbols, that is, the<br>
symbols that are associated with the one or more other data-types, for example, the<br>
pilot data and the synchronization data, and which symbols are not phase shifted<br>
by the transmit side, are conveyed directly by inverse transformer 278 to P/S<br>
converter 280. In other words, when the transmitted data includes multiple<br>
encrypted symbols associated with user data and multiple non-encrypted symbols<br>
associated with non-user data, such as pilot data or synchronization data, S/P<br>
converter 276 assigns the downconverted signal to multiple time domain<br>
subcarriers, wherein one or more time domain subcarriers of the multiple time<br>
domain subcarriers are associated with the user data and one or more time domain<br>
subcarriers of the multiple time domain subcarriers are associated with the pilot<br>
data. Inverse transformer 278 then transforms each time domain subcarrier<br>
associated with user data to a frequency domain subcarrier to produce multiple<br>
encrypted symbols and further transforms each time domain subcarrier associated<br>
with non-user data to a frequency domain subcarrier to produce multiple non-<br>
encrypted symbols. Inverse transformer 278 then conveys the encrypted symbols<br>
to phase shifter module 282, and more particularly to phase shifters PSI-PSN, and<br>
conveys the non-encrypted symbols to P/S converter 280. Each phase shifter PSI-<br>
PSN decrypts a received encrypted symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol based<br>
on a code word to produce a decrypted symbol and conveys the decrypted symbol<br>
to P/S converter 280. P/S converter 280 then converts the decrypted symbols<br>
received from phase shifter module 282 and the non-encrypted symbols received<br>
from inverse transformer 278 from a parallel format to a serial format.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a CDMA embodiment,<br>
orthogonal demodulator 274 may comprise at least one despreader instead of an S/<br>
P converter, inverse transformer, and P/S converter. In such an embodiment, the at<br>
least one despreader despreads (816) a received, encrypted symbol by applying an<br>
orthogonal spreading code, that is, a CDMA subcarrier, corresponding to the<br>
orthogonal spreading code used by orthogonal modulator 214, to demodulate the<br>
received signal and to produce a stream of demodulated, that is, despread,<br>
encrypted symbols. For example, orthogonal demodulator 274 may comprise<br>
multiple serial despreaders, wherein one despreader of the multiple despreaders<br>
despreads each symbol with a long code and another despreader of the multiple<br>
despreaders spreads the symbol with a Walsh code or an OVSF. Further, in the<br>
CDMA embodiment of the present invention, signal processing unit 274 may or<br>
may not include C/P remover 272. In the CDMA embodiment, orthogonal<br>
demodulator 274 then conveys each despread, encrypted symbol to phase shifter<br>
282. As described in detail above, phase shifter 282 then decrypts (818) each<br>
despread, encrypted symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol in compensation for<br>
the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210, thereby producing<br>
multiple decrypted symbols.<br>
Inverse symbol mapper 286 produces a bit stream by recovering (820) the<br>
P-tuple corresponding to each decrypted symbol based on the symbol mapping<br>
scheme used by symbol mapper 208. That is, inverse symbol mapper 286 maps<br>
each symbol to a corresponding point in the constellation used by symbol mapper<br>
208, thereby recovering the P-tuple corresponding to that point. Inverse symbol<br>
mapper 286 then conveys the recovered bit stream to a decoder 288. Decoder 288<br>
decodes (822) the bit stream based on the error correction code applied by encoder<br>
206 and conveys the decoded bit stream to a data sink (not shown), and logic flow<br>
800 then ends (824).<br>
By shifting a phase of a symbol that is to be transmitted based on<br>
information known to the transmitting and receiving communication devices,<br>
communication system 100 provides encryption at a physical layer that makes an<br><br>
air interface more secure against decryption by an undesired interceptor of a<br>
communication. In one embodiment of the invention, a symbol mapper included<br>
in a transmitting communication device produces multiple symbols based on a<br>
received bit stream and a symbol mapping scheme. A phase shifter included in the<br>
transmitting communication device then shifts a phase of each symbol based on a<br>
code word to produce an encrypted symbol, which code word may be generated by<br>
a code word generator based on one or more encryption keys known to both the<br>
transmitting and receiving communication devices. The encrypted symbols are<br>
then transmitted via the air interface. In turn, the receiving communication device<br>
decrypts received, encrypted symbols by shifting each received, encrypted symbol<br>
by a phase corresponding to the phase used to encrypt the symbol, thereby<br>
producing a decrypted symbol. An inverse symbol mapper then recovers the bits<br>
corresponding to each decrypted symbol based on the symbol mapping scheme<br>
used by the transmitting device symbol mapper.<br>
