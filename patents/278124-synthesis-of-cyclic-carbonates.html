				<td>The present invention relates to a process for synthesising cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide using aluminium(salen) complexes as catalysts. The invention also provides novel aluminium(salen) complexes, and their synthesis.<br>
Cyclic carbonates are commercially important products currently manufactured on a multi-tonne scale for use as polar aprotic solvents, additives, antifoam agents for anti-freeze, plasticisers, and monomers for polymer synthesis (see Darensbourg, et al., Coord. Chem. Rev., 153 (1996), 155-174; Coates, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 43(2004), 6618-6639).<br>
The synthesis of cyclic carbonates generally involves the reaction of epoxides with carbon dioxide, and hence could be used to sequestrate carbon dioxide, thus reducing the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br>
Catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide are known in the art (see Darensbourg, et al., Coord. Chem. Rev., 153 (1996), 155-174; Yoshida, et al., Chem. Eur. J., 10 (2004), 2886-2893; Sun, et al., J. Organomet. Chem., 690 (2005), 3490-3497) although these require elevated reaction temperatures and / or high pressures of carbon dioxide, the reaction often being conducted in supercritical carbon dioxide (see Lu, et al., App. Cat. A, 234 (2002), 25-33).<br>
Ratzenhofer, et al., (Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. Engl., 19 (1980), 317-318) succeeded in carrying out the reaction between 2-methyloxirane and carbon dioxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using catalysts consisting of a mixture of a metal halide and a Lewis base. However, a long reaction time of 7 days was required. Kisch, etal., (Chem. Ber., 119 (1986), 1090-1094), carrying out the same reaction under the same conditions and also using catalysts of this type, reports a reaction time of 3.5 to 93 hours using up to 4 mol% of a ZnCI2 catalyst and up to 16 mol% of a (nButyl)4NI catalyst.<br>
Lu, et al., (J. Mol. Cat. A, 210 (2004), 31-34; J. Cat., 227 (2004), 537-541) describe the use of tetradentate Schiff-base aluminium complexes in conjunction with a quaternary ammonium salt or polyether-KY complexes as catalyst systems for the<br>
reaction of various epoxides with carbon dioxide at room temperature and about 6 atmospheres.<br>
Metal(salen) complexes, including aluminium(salen) complexes, are well-known in the art for their use as catalysts. Lu, et al., App. Cat. A, 234 (2002), 25-33, describes the use of a monomeric aluminium(salen) catalyst.<br>
Also known in the art is the method of synthesising aluminium(salen) catalysts by treating a salen ligand with Me3AI, Et3AI, Me2AICI, Me2AIOTf, Et2AIBr or Et2AICI in a two-stage process (reviewed in Atwood and Harvey, Chem. Rev., 2001, 101, 37-52).<br>
The present inventor has previously found that, in the presence of a tetraalkylammonium halide cocatalyst, dimeric aluminium(salen) complexes are highly active catalysts for the reaction of epoxides with carbon dioxide to produce cyclic carbonates, and allow the reaction to be carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, using short reaction times and commercially viable amounts of catalyst, as described in Melendez, J., et a/., Eur J. Inorg Chem, 2007, 3323-3326 and co-pending UK patent application No. 0708016.1, filed 25 April 2007, now published as WO 2008/132474.<br>
The present inventor has now found that it is possible to incorporate the co-catalyst required in this work into the catalyst molecule, so as to reduce or eliminate the amount of separate components needed. Furthermore, the present inventor has also found it is possible to immobilise the combined catalyst and co-catalyst on a solid support.<br>
Accordingly a first aspect of the invention provides a dimeric aluminium(salen) catalyst of formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 wherein:<br>
Y-Q is CRC++1=N or CRC++1RC2-NRN1, where RC++1, RC2 and RN1 are independently selected from H, halo, optionally substituted C1-20 alkyl, optionally substituted C5-20 aryl, ether and nitro;<br>
each of the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R1°, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, and R16, is independently selected from H, halo, optionally substituted d-20 alkyl (including CAr3, where Ar is a C5-20 aryl group), optionally substituted C5-20 aryl, optionally substituted C3-20 heterocyclyl, ether and nitro; X1 and X2 are independently either (i) a C2-5 alkylene chain, which is optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from C1-4 alkyl and C5-7 aryl, or a C1-3 bisoxyalkylene chain, which is optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from C1-4 alkyl and C5-7 aryl or (ii) represent a divalent group selected from C5-7 arylene, C5-7 cyclic alkylene and C3-7 heterocyclylene, which may be optionally substituted;<br>
(i) (a)   at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R6, R7, Re, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, and R16 is selected from L-A, where L is a single bond or a d-10 alkylene group and A is an ammonium group paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; and/or<br>
(b)	at least one of X1 and X2 is a divalent C3-7 heterocyclene group, containing a ring atom which is a quaternary nitrogen atom paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; and/or<br>
(c)	at least one of X1 and X2 is a C2-5 alkylene chain or a C1-3 bisoxyalkylene chain, substituted by a group -Q-L-A, where Q is either -C(=O)-O-, -C(=O)-NH-, or a single bond;<br>
and/or<br>
(ii) (a) one of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, and R16 is L-A', where L is as defined above and A' is a ammonium linking group bound to a solid support and paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; or (b) one of X1 and X2 is a divalent C3-7 heterocyclene group, containing a ring atom which is a quaternary nitrogen forming part of an ammonium linking group bound to a solid support and paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; or (c)   one of X1 and X2 is a C2-5 alkylene chain or a C1-3 bisoxyalkylene chain, substituted by a group -Q-L-A'.<br>
Thus, when the catalyst is covalently bound to a solid support, only one linking group to the solid support is present. However, one or more ammonium groups/quaternary nitrogen atoms may be present.<br>
The catalysts of formula I where: (a) at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, and R16 is selected from L-A; and/or (b) at least one of X1 and X2 is a divalent C3-7 heterocyclene group, containing a ring atom which is a quaternary nitrogen atom paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; and/or (c) at least one of X1 and X2 is a C2-5 alkylene chain or a C1-3 bisoxyalkylene chain, substituted by a group -Q-L-A, where Q is either -C(=O)- or a single bond, may be immobilized on a solid support, either by the use of steric effects or by electrostatic binding.<br>
If the catalyst of formula I includes one or more chiral centres, then it may be a (wholly or partially) racemic mixture or other mixture thereof, for example, a mixture enriched in one enantiomer or diastereoisomer, a single enantiomer or diastereoisomer, or a mixture of the stereoisomers. Methods for the preparation (e.g., asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g., fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner. Preferably the catalyst of formula I is a single enantiomer, if a chiral centre is present.<br>
The dimeric aluminium(salen) catalysts of the first aspect may be of formula la:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 where R1, R2, R3, R4 and X1 are as defined above; and<br>
(a)	at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is selected from L-A, where L is a single<br>
bond or a C1-10 alkylene group and A is an ammonium group paired with a<br>
counterion selected from CI, Br and I; and/or<br>
(b)	X1 is a divalent C3-7 heterocyclene group, containing a ring atom which is a quaternary nitrogen atom paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I; or<br>
(c)	X1 is a C2-5 alkylene chain or a C1-3 bisoxyalkylene chain, substituted by a group -Q-L-A, where Q is either -C(=O)- or a single bond.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a process for the production of cyclic carbonates comprising contacting an epoxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a dimeric aluminium(salen) catalyst according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The reaction of the second aspect may be defined as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 <br>
wherein RC3 and RC4 are independently selected from H, optionally substituted C1-10 alkyl, optionally substituted C3-20 heterocyclyl and optionally substituted C5-20 aryl, or RC3 and RC4 form an optionally substituted linking group between the two carbon atoms to which they are respectively attached. The linking group, together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached, may form an optionally substituted C5-20 cycloalkyl or C5-20 heterocylyl group.   The C5-20 cycloalkyl or C5-20 heterocylyl group may be substituted only in a single position on the ring, for example, adjacent the<br>
epoxide. Suitable substituents, include optionally substituted C1-10 alkyl, optionally substituted C3-20 heterocyclyl and optionally substituted C5-20 aryl.<br>
A possible substituent for the C1-10 alkyl group is a C5-20 aryl group.<br>
The second aspect of the invention also provides the use of a dimeric aluminium(salen) catalyst of the first aspect of the invention for the production of cyclic carbonates from epoxides.<br>
A third aspect of the invention provides a process for the synthesis of a dimeric aluminium(salen) catalyst of formula I.<br>

Definitions<br>
Epoxide: The term "epoxide", as used herein, may pertain to a compound of the<br>
formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 <br>
wherein RC3 and RC4 are independently selected from H, optionally substituted C1-10 alkyl, optionally substituted C3-20 heterocyclyl and optionally substituted C5-20 aryl, or RC3 and RC4 form an optionally substituted linking group between the two carbon atoms to which they are respectively attached. The linking group, together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached, may form an optionally substituted C5-20 cycloalkyl or C5-20 heterocylyl group.   The C5-20 cycloalkyl or C5-20 heterocylyl group may be substituted only in a single position on the ring, for example, adjacent the epoxide. Suitable substituents, include optionally substituted C1-10 alkyl, optionally substituted C3-20 heterocyclyl and optionally substituted C5-20 aryl.<br>
The optional substituents may be selected from: C1-10 alkyl, C3-20 heterocyclyl, C5-20 aryl, halo, hydroxy, ether, cyano, nitro, carboxy, ester, amido, amino, acylamido, ureido, acyloxy, thiol, thioether, sulfoxide, sulfonyl, thioamido and sulfonamino.<br>
In some embodiments, the C1-10 alkyl group is substituted by a C5-20 aryl group.<br>
Preferably, the epoxide is a terminal epoxide, i.e. RC4 = H.<br>
In some embodiments, RC3 is selected from optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl and optionally substituted C5-7 aryl. In some of these embodiments RC3 is unsubstituted.<br>
Preferred epoxides are ethylene oxide (RC3 = RC4 = H), propylene oxide (RC3 = methyl, RC4 = H) butylene oxide (RC3 = ethyl, RC4 = H), and styrene oxide (RC3 = phenyl, RC4 = H).<br>
Cyclic carbonate: the term "cyclic carbonate", as used herein, may pertain to a compound of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 <br>
wherein RC3 and RC4 are as defined above.<br>
Solid support: Catalysts of the present invention may be immobilized on a solid support by:<br>
(a)	covalent binding (those where one of of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, and R16 is selected from L-A');<br>
(b)	steric trapping; or<br>
(c)	electrostatic binding.<br>
These various methods are reviewed by Carlos Baleizao and Hermenegildo Garcia in "Chiral Salen Complexes: An Overview to Recoverable and Reusable Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysts" (Chem. Rev. 2006, 106, 3987-4043).<br>
For covalent binding, the solid support needs to contain or be derivatized to contain reactive functionalities which can serve for covalently linking a compound to the surface thereof. Such materials are well known in the art and include, by way of example, silicon dioxide supports containing reactive Si-OH groups, polyacrylamide supports, polystyrene supports, polyethyleneglycol supports, and the like. A further example is sol-gel materials. Silica can be modified to include a 3-chloropropyloxy group by treatment with (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane. Another example is Al pillared clay, which can also be modified to include a 3-chloropropyloxy group by treatment with (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane. Such supports will preferably take the<br>
form of small beads, pins/crowns, laminar surfaces, pellets or disks. They may also take the form of powders. Solid supports for covalent binding of particular interest in the present invention include siliceous MCM-41 and MCM-48 (modified with 3-aminopropyl groups), ITQ-2 and amorphous silica, SBA-15 and hexagonal mesoporous silica. Also of particular interest are sol-gels. Other conventional forms may also be used.<br>
For steric trapping, the most suitable class of solid support is zeolites, which may be natural or modified. The pore size must be sufficiently small to trap the catalyst but sufficiently large to allow the passage of reactants and products to and from the catalyst. Suitable zeolites include zeolites X, Y and EMT as well as those which have been partially degraded to provide mesopores, that allow easier transport of reactants and products.<br>
For the electrostatic binding of the catalyst to a solid support, typical solid supports may include silica, Indian clay, Al-pillared clay, AI-MCM-41, K10, laponite, bentonite, and zinc-alumium layered double hydroxide. Of these silica and montmorillonite clay are of particular interest.<br>
Alkyl: The term "alky!", as used herein, pertains to a monovalent moiety obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom of a hydrocarbon having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms (unless otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic and which may be saturated or unsaturated (e.g. partially saturated, fully unsaturated). Thus, the term "alkyl" includes the sub-classes alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, etc., as discussed below.<br>
Alkylene: The term "alkylene", as used herein, pertains to a divalent moiety obtained by removing two hydrogen atoms from one or two carbon atoms of a hydrocarbon having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms (unless otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic and which may be saturated or unsaturated (e.g. partially saturated, fully unsaturated). Thus, the term "alkylene" includes the sub-classes alkenylene, alkynylene, cycloalkylene, cycloalkenylene, cycloalkynylene, etc., as discussed below.<br>
In the context of alkyl and alkylene groups, the prefixes (e.g. C1-4, C1-7, C1-20, C2-7, C3-7, etc.) denote the number of carbon atoms, or the range of number of carbon atoms. For example, the term "C1-4 alkyl", as used herein, pertains to an alkyl group having<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of groups of alkyl groups include C1-4 alkyl ("lower alkyl"), C1-7 alkyl and C1-20 alkyl. Note that the first prefix may vary according to other limitations; for example, for unsaturated alkyl groups, the first prefix must be at least 2; for cyclic alkyl groups, the first prefix must be at least 3; etc. For example, the term "C1-7 alkylene", as used herein, pertains to an alkylene group having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of (unsubstituted) saturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (d), ethyl (C2), propyl (C3), butyl (C4), pentyl (C5), hexyl (C6), and heptyl (C7).<br>
Examples of (unsubstituted) saturated linear alkyl groups Include, but are not limited to, methyl (d), ethyl (C2), n-propyl (C3), n-butyl (C4), n-pentyl (amyl) (C5), n-hexyl (C6), and n-heptyl (C7).<br>

Chemically Protected Forms<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, handle and/or use the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form" is used herein in the conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like). In practice, well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive, under specified conditions. In a chemically protected form, one or more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be<br>
performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes chemically protected forms thereof.<br>
A wide variety of such "protecting," "blocking," or "masking" methods are widely used and well known in organic synthesis. For example, a compound which has two nonequivalent reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the functional groups "protected," and therefore unreactive, under the specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group. After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group) is complete, the protected group may be "deprotected" to return it to its original functionality.<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=O) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy<br>

 wherein:<br>
Y-Q is CRC1=N or CRC1RC2-NRN1, where RC1, RC2 and RN1 are independently selected<br>
from H, halo, optionally substituted C1-20 alkyl, optionally substituted C5-20 aryl, ether<br>

solid support and paired with a counterion selected from CI, Br and I.<br>
The preferences expressed above also apply to the catalysts of formula lb, where appropriate.<br>
The reaction may be carried out under solvent-free conditions, depending on the epoxides used. In some cases, the epoxides or the cyclic carbonates may act as a solvent for the catalyst. In particular, the inventors have found that propylene carbonate acts a suitable reaction solvent.<br>
Some reactions may need the addition of a co-catalyst, Y", and in particular MY, where M is a suitable cation, such as onium halides, which include, but are not limited to, R4NY, R3SY, R4PY and R4SbY, where each R is independently selected from optionally substituted d.10 alkyl, C3.20 heterocyclyl and C5-20 aryl groups and one R can be an acyl group, and simple halides, e.g. NaCI, Kl.<br>
It is preferred that the co-catalyst for this reaction is of the form R4NY, where each R is independently C1-10 alkyl and Y is selected from I, Br and CI. R is preferably selected from C3-5 alkyl, and more preferably is butyl. Y is preferably Br. Therefore, a particularly preferred co-catalyst is Bu4NBr (TBAB). The amount of co-catalyst is preferably less than 2.5%, more preferably less than 1.0 mol% and most preferably less than 0.5 mol%. In some embodiments, no separate co-catalyst is present.<br>
Manufacture of dimeric aluminium(salen) complexes<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the production of<br>
dimeric aluminium(salen) catalysts of formula I.<br>
When the catalyst of formula I comprises one or more ammonium group paired with a counterion, it may be synthesised from a precursor comprising the corresponding ammonia groups by reaction with a organic halide (i.e. a C1-7 alkyl, C3-20 heterocyclyl or C5-20 aryl halide), or an organic group with another leaving group (e.g. tosylate).<br>
When the catalyst of formula I comprises an ammonium linking group bound to a solid support, it may be synthesised from a precursor catalyst comprising a corresponding ammonia group by reaction with a halide derived solid support or a solid support derivatized with another leaving group (e.g. tosylate).<br>

Ethylene oxide was collected from a commercially supplied cylinder as a liquid in a cooled beaker at -78°C and placed, with a magnetic stirrer bar, inside a 360 mL pre-cooled (-10 to -40°C) stainless steel pressure vessel (3). The vessel was then sealed. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases were supplied from cylinders via mass flow controller units (1) and their respective lines merged to the inlet of the pressure vessel (see diagram). All tubing used in the system was composed of stainless steel with an internal diameter of approximately 1.6mm. The temperature of the pressure vessel (3) was controlled by a cryostatically cooled bath (2) to provide the required rate of evaporation of ethylene oxide at a particular flow rate of N2 and CO2. This was determined by passing the vessel outlet line directly into a GC system (6) fitted with a column capable of separating the three gases. The vessel outlet line was then connected to a stainless steel tubular reactor (4)(15 cm x 10 mm) packed with a solid supported catalyst and plugged at both ends with a small volume of cotton. The tubular reactor (4) was either kept at ambient temperature or immersed in a thermostatted water bath. The mixture of CO2,<br>
ethylene oxide and N2 was passed through the reactor column at a steady flow rate. The outlet of the reactor (4) was connected to a sealed glass vial (5) via a needle to collect any non-gaseous products. The outlet from the product receptacle passed to a GC system (6) which was used to determine the concentrations of CO2, N2 and ethylene oxide in the effluent gas stream. The results obtained with both silica and polystyrene supported catalysts are given in the following table.<br>
