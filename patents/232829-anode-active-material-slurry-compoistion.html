				<td>ANODE ACTIVE MATERIAL SLURRY COMPOSITION Technical  Field<br>
The present invention relates to anode active material slurry having improved dispersibility oE an anode active material and a conductive agent, and a lithium secondary cell comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
In    general,      a     secondary     cell     using     non-aqueous electrolyte  solution comprises   an  anode,   a  cathode,   and a non-aqueous     electrolyte     layer.      In     order     to     form     a cathode,    cathode   slurry   comprising   a    lithium-transition metal   oxide   as   a   cathode   active   material,   polyvinylidene fluoride    (PVdF)    as    a    binder    and   N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)    as    a    solvent    is   prepared,    the    cathode    slurry   is coated    on    a    collector   made    of    a   metal    foil,    and    then drying,     pressing    and    molding     steps    are    performed.     In order   to    form   an    anode,    the    same   method   as    described above   is   performed,    except    that   anode   slurry   comprising carbon     or     carbon     composite      capable     of     lithium     ion intercalation/      deintercalation      as      an      anode       active material,   polyvinylidene  fluoride   (PVdF)   as   a   binder   and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone   (NMP)   as   a  solvent is used.<br>
However,     when    polyvinylidene    fluoride     (PVdF)     is used    as    a    binder,     the    interfacial    adhesion    between    a collector   and   an   electrode   active  material   and   the   close adhesion   among   the   electrode   active  material  molecules   is low,    and   thus    the   electrode   active   material   pressed   and adhered    to    the    collector    may    be    separated    and    removed from   the    collector,    when    a    coated   electrode    is    cut    to conform    to    a    desired    product    size,     e.g.,    by    slitting, thereby  causing   the   decrease   of   a   nominal   voltage   or   the<br>
irregularity of  a  cell  capacity.<br>
Additionally,   repeated   charge/discharge   cycles   of   a cell  may  cause   the  separation   and   removal  of  an  electrode active    material     by     the     shrink     and     expansion     of     an electrode.     Accordingly,     as    charge/discharge    cycles    are repeated,    the   removal    of    the    electrode   active   material from    a    collector    is    accelerated,      thereby    causing    the decrease    of    a    cell    capacity.     Moreover,    a    high-voltage state    such     as     overcharge,     or     a     temperature     increase resulting    from    the    high-voltage     state    may    cause    the decomposition      of     polyvinylidene       fluoride      (PVdF)       to generate   hydrogen   fluoride,    and   thus    generated   hydrogen fluoride    may    cause    a    side    reaction    with    the    active material    on    the    surface    of    the    collector   or    a    trace amount of metal  lithium precipitates.<br>
In     addition     to     the      aboveâ€”mentioned     problems,<br>
because         polyvinylidene         fluoride	has         a	high<br>
crystallization   degree,   it   has   to   be   added   in   an   amount<br>
of 2.5 wt% or more based on the   total  weight of the  anode<br>
active  material   in   order   to   prevent   the   removal   of   the<br>
active  material   in   a   cutting   or   punching   step.    Such   an<br>
increased proportion of  the  binder  to   the  total  weight   of<br>
the  anode  active material  results   in   the  decrease   of  the<br>
proportion   of   the   active   material,    thereby   causing   the<br>
decrease of a  full  cell capacity.<br>
Accordingly,     as    a   solution    to    solve    the    above-mentioned    problems,     an    electrode    using    a    rubber-based binder  such   as   a   styrene-butadiene   rubber   (SBR)   has   been investigated.     An     SBR-based     binder     porovides     the     same degree   of   effect   as   PVdF,   even   though   it   is   used   in   an amount     smaller     than     PVdF,      and     is      electrochemical ly stable.    When    an    SBR-based    binder    is    used,    it    can    be dispersed    in    water,     so   that    water    may    be    used    as    a solvent  for electrode  active material   slurry,   and  thus   it is environmental-friendly.<br>
Meanwhile,      viscosity     control     is     essential     to     a coating    process.     In    a    coating    process,     a    viscosity,     a solid     content,     a     coating     layer     thickness.      -     coating speed,      a     solvent      evaporation      speed      and      a     solvent evaporation     amount      are      organically      related     with     one another.    Therefore,    when    an   SBR-based   binder   is   used,    a thickener   is   used   to   control    the   viscosity   of   electrode slurry.    More    particularly,     a     cellulose-based    thickener such       as      carboxymethyl        cellulose        (CMC)        has       been investigated.   The   use   of   a   styrene-butadiene   rubber   (SBR) as  a   binder and  the  use  of   a  cellulose-based  polymer  as a thickener  help to  decrease   the   danger  of  a   cell explosion and  to   increase a  cell  capacity.   Additionally,   the  use  of a   thickener   inhibits    the    settling   of   solid   contents   so that   constant viscosities   in  the  upper  and  lower parts  of a   solution  and a   uniform   dispersion   state   in   the  solution may   be    retained    for    a    long    time    and    the    viscosity    of slurry may-be stabilized.<br>
However,   the  electrode  active material   slurry  using the    aforesaid   binder    and    thickener   has    difficulties    in dispersion thereof  due   to   the   difference   of   the   specific gravity  of the electrode   active   material   and  those of  the binder    and   thickener.     Therefore,    the    viscosity   becomes difficult   to  control   and   to  maintain  with   times,   and  the diffusion   effect   of   carbon    black   used    as    a    conductive agent   becomes   poor,    thus    adversely   affecting   the   mixing with    the   active   material,     so    that   uniform   distributions of   the   active  material   and   the   conductive   agent   over   the whole     surfaces    of    the    electrode    may    not    be    obtained, thereby  causing coating  problems.<br>
Because CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) has some dispersion effect, when the amount of CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) is increased, it is possible to improve the deterioration of the diffusion effect of carbon black and to solve the dispersion-related problems. However, in<br>
this    case,     the    weight    ratio    of    CMC    per    weight     of    the active   material    is   increased,    and    thus    the   weight    ratio of    the   active   material    is    reduced.    This    results    in    the reduction    of    a    cell    capacity    and    the    deterioration    of cell   properties.   Additionally,    the   viscosity   is   increased due   to   the   increase  of   the   amount   of   a   thickener   to   such a   degree   that   cannot   be  applied   in   a   practical   process, and    thus    water    as    a    solvent     is    added    to    adjust    the viscosity,       thereby     causing      the      reduction      of      solid contents.<br>
Disclosure  of the Invention<br>
	Accordingly,   the present   invention  has  been  made   to<br>
solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to solve the dispersion-related problems by adding a very small amount of a specific dispersant without changing the solid contents and the amount of a thickener.<br>
In    order     to    accomplish     this    object,      there     is provided anode active material  slurry comprising:<br>
(a)   a   carbon-based  anode   active  material,    that   is capable of lithium ion intercalation/ deintercalation;<br>
(b)	a  conductive agent/<br>
(c)	a   binder   comprising    a    styrene-butadiene-based<br>
polymer resin,-<br>
(d)	a   thickener  comprising   a   cellulose-based   or   an<br>
acrylate-based  resin;<br>
(e)	a     dispersant    comprising    a    polymer    backbone<br>
capable    of    surface-adsorption     and    a    side-chain     ha-/ing<br>
non-ionic surfactant properties;   and<br>
(f)	water.<br>
There is also provided a lithium secondary cell comprising an anode obtained by using the anode active material slurry.<br>
The present invention is characterized by using a<br>
dispersant comprising a polymer backbone capable of surface-adsorption combined with a side-chain having non-ionic surfactant properties, _n anode active material slurry of a lithium secondary cell.<br>
The   present    invention   will    be    explained    in   detail hereinafter.<br>
According    to    the   present    invention,     as    an    anode active   material,    artificial    graphite,     natural   graphite, fiber    graphite,    crystalline    carbon    or    amorphous   carbon formed   of   carbon   or   carbon   composite   capable   of   lithium ion  intercalation/deintercalation  may  be   used.   The  amount of the  anode active material  in   the  anode  active material slurry   ranges  from   50  wt%   to   99   wt%,    preferably   from  90 wt%  to  97 wt%.<br>
As a conductive agent, acetylene black or graphite may be used. The amount of the conductive agent in the anode active material slurry ranges from 0.01 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.1 wt% to 3 wt%.<br>
Preferably, the styrene-butadiene-based polymer<br>
resin used as a binder according to the present invention<br>
is at least one resin selected from the group consisting<br>
of	styrene-butadiene	rubbers	(SBR) ,	modified<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene    rubbers,     in    which    2    to    10    of cyano    groups    are    substituted     with     carboxylic    groups, polychloroprene,   polyisobutylene   butyl   rubbers,   ethylene-propylene   methyl   ether,    polyperfluorobutyl    acrylate   and polyhexafluoropropylene oxide.<br>
The styrene-butadiene-based polymer resin is preferably used in an amount of from 0.5 to 10 wtl, and more preferably from 1 to 3 wt/C based on the total weight of the anode active material slurry.<br>
As a thickener, an acrylic polymer and a cellulose-based polymer may be used. Acrylic polymers include polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) , polyvinyl alcohol, etc., and cellulose-based polymers include hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
(fiEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose H: â€¢ , ethylhydroxyethyI cellulose (EHEd, methyl celluios- (MC) , hydroxyeikyl methyl cellulose, etc.<br>
The amount of ihe thickener in the anode active material slurry ranges from 0.01 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.1 wtl to 3 wt%.<br>
Meanwhile, a conventional dispersant including a surfactant participates in a point-contact, in which the adsorption surface is very small, and the adsorption is accomplished between materials having the same surface properties. Generally, the adsorption using the same surface properties is a chemical adsorption, which occurs by transfer of electrons on surfaces, followed by interactions with ions or electron sharing.<br>
However,    a   carbon-based   material   such  as   graphite, acetylene   black    or    carbon    black,    which    is   used    as    an anode   active   material   for   a    lithium   ion   secondary   cell, or   a   carbon-based   conductive   agent   such   as   carbon   black has     no     surface     activities,      i.e.,      hydrophilicity     or hydrophobicity.   Therefore,   a   conventional  dispersant   such as    an    anionic    surfactant,      a     cationic    surfactant,     an amphoionic     surfactant,       or      an      amphoteric     surfactant showing   charges    by    a    solution    pH    is    not    expected    to provide any effects.<br>
Accordingly,      for     the     purpose     of     improving     the dispersion    properties    of    the     said    inert    carbon-based anode     active    material     and/or     carbon-based    conductive agent,    the  present   invention   is   characterized  by   using   a dispersant     comprising     a     polymer     backbone     capable     of physically  bonding,    i.e.,    adsorption,    to   the   surface   of carbon,     combined    with    a     side-chain    having    surfactant properties   reguired    for   dispersion,    in   the   same   molecule (see  FIG.   1 and  FIG.   2) .<br>
The polymer  backbone   in   the   dispersant   according   to the      present      invention      is       a       part,       which      can      be<br>
participated   5ome'.-/nat    in a   physical   boneing;   even   with an inert    surface    by   usinq    a    physical   adsorption    phenomenon caused    by     Van    der     wa-ls      force.     While   a     convene iona I dispersant    has   a   very   srnal]    adsorption   surface   as   in   the case    of    a     point-contact,      the     polymer    cackbone     in     the dispersant     used    in    the    present     invention    has    a     large adsorption   surface,   so   that    it   permits   surface   adsorption even    with    an    inert    material .     The    adsorption    capability depends   on    the   molecular    weight,     i.e.,    surface    area    of the polymer  backbone.<br>
Non-limiting     examples       of      the     polymer      backbone<br>
include  an   acrylic  polymer   such   as   polymethylraethacrylate<br>
(PMMA),   polyvinylidene   fluoride    (PVdF),   etc.,    and   PMMA  is<br>
preferable  in  order  to  maximize   the  adsorption  surface   to<br>
the surface  of the anode active   material.<br>
The only factor that affects the dispersant of the present invention is its surface area, and thus the dispersant of the present invention can be used for dispersing any materials having no surface active groups other than a carbon-based active material or a conductive .agent. This is also includeo! in the scope of the present invention.<br>
The   side-chain   preferably   has   non-ionic   surfactant properties.    Materials   showing    electrochemically   positive or   negative   charges   have   a    great   possibility   to   affect the    action     of    a     cell     through     any    paths,     and     thus electrochemically    inert,     i.e.,      non-ionic   materials    are preferable   to   be   used   in    a    cell.    However,    a   side-chain having    ionic     properties     can     be     used     in.    the     present invention,     as    long    as    it     is     stable    in   the    range    of effective   cell   voltages    (0   to   4.5   V   vs.   Li/Li*) .    This   is also included  in  the  scope   of   the   present  invention.<br>
Meanwhile, non-limiting examples of the side-chain having non-ionic surfactant properties in the dispersant according to the present invention include the following:<br>

Preferably, the dispersant is a copolymer as shown in FIG. 2, such as Hypermer available from Unichema, in which the copolymer comprises PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) as a backbone (a part to be adsorbed) and PEO (polyethylene oxide) as a side-chain for imparting dispersibility.<br>
When      the     dispersant      according      to      the     present invention   is   added  to  the  solution  of   electrode   slurry   ina small amount, it iS possible to improve the dispersibility of the electrode active material by the dispersant and to increase the ratio of solid concents under the same viscosity.<br>
Addirlonally,    when   the   dispersant    according   to   the present    invention   is   added   to   the   solution   of   electrode slurry   in   a   small   amount,    it   is   possible   to    reduce   the amount    of   a    thickener    such   as   CMC,    and    to   prevent    the difficulties     in     viscosity     control,      the     reduction     of dispersibility       and        the        deterioration        of       coating properties.<br>
The said dispersant is preferably added in an amount of from 0.01 wt% to 10 wt%, and more preferably from 0.1 wt% to 1 wt%, based on the total weight of the anode active material slurry (solid contents).<br>
Preferably, the weight average molecular weight of the dispersant is in the range of from 10,000 to 30,000.<br>
Meanwhile,     the    dispersion    effect     depends    on    the Jcind   of  the  side-chain  and  the substitution degree  of the side-chain  in the case  of a  substituted  side-chain.   Also, the  dispersibility and  surface adsorption   property depend on  the  length   (molecular weight)   of  the  backbone.<br>
Considering the viscosity control in a process for coating an electrode, it is preferable that the solid content of the anode active material slurry is 30 wt% to 70 wt% and the coating layer thickness is 50 jim to 200 u.m.<br>
-According    to    the    present    invention,     in    order    to form   an  anode  of  a  cell,    the   anode  active   material  slurry of    the   present   invention    isÂ«   coated    on    a    collector   and water   as   a   solvent  is   removed  by,   e.g.,    drying   the  active material   in   order   to   adhere   it    to   the    collector   and   to closely     adhere     the      active     material      molecules     among themselves.   Although   there   is   no  particular   limitation  as long   as   the   collector   is   formed  of  a   conductive   material,<br>
the    collector    is   preferably    formed   of    a    me: ai.    such    as iron,    copper,   aluminum  and  nickel.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out  the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is to be understood that the following examples are illustrative only and the present invention is not<br>
limited   thereto. [Example   1]<br>
First,    CMC   powder    (0.26   g;    about   1    wt.%)    used   as   a thickener    for    the    solution    of    electrode    active   material slurry   was   dissolved   in   12.5   q   of   distilled  water   at   50Â°C to   prepare   CMC   solution.    Next,     25   g    (about    97    wt %)    of graphite   powder   used  as   an   electrode   active  material   was introduced   into   a   mortar,    the   CMC   solution   prepared   in advance   was   poured   gradually,    and   then    stirred    with    a pestle      for      about      10     minutes.       After      completion      of stirring,    0.51   g   (about   1.9   wt%)    of  SBR  solution   used   as a   binder   was   introduced   into   the   mortar   and   stirred   for additional  5 minutes.   Finally,   0.026 g   (about  0.1   wt%)   of PEO-PMMA   copolymer    (available   from   Unichema   in   the    name of  Hypermer)   used  as a   dispersant   was   added  and   stirred, while    adding    43.5    g   of   distilled    water    gradually.     And then,    the   solid   content   of   the   electrode   active   material slurry was  adjusted   to 43 wt%-<br>
The viscosity change for the electrode active material slurry prepared as the above was measured by using Thermo Hakke RSI viscometer at 30Â°C under a shear rate ranged from 0.1 to 1000 (1/s) . The results are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
Electrode     slurry    was     prepared     as     described     in Example  1,    except  that  the  dispersant   was   not   added.    The viscosity    was    measured    under    the    same    range    of    shear rates  at 30Â°C.   The  results are  shown  in  FIG.   4. [Analysis   for the results]<br>
As shown in FIG. 3 showing the viscosity of Example 1, the graph takes a form in which a viscosity decreases substantially with the same slope, as a shear rate increases. Also, substantially identical viscosity profiles are shown both in the case of increasing the shear rate and in the case of decreasing the shear rate.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, there was no change in the viscosity of the electrode slurry under trie same shear rate.<br>
However,    as    shown    in    FIG.    4,     in    the   case    of    the anode    active   material    slurry    of    Comparative    Example    1 without    using   a    dispersant,     the    graph    takes   a    form    in which   a   viscosity   has   a   maximum   under   a   shear  rate   of   10 (1/s)    and   decreases   again,    as   a   shear   rate   increases.    On the   other   hand,   as   a   shear   rate   decreases,    a   hysteresis phenomenon      is      shown,       wherein      a       viscosity      profile different   from   that   in   the   case   of   increasing   the   shear rate   is   obtained.    Therefore,    it   seems   that   the  electrode slurry     was    poorly    dispersed.     Additionally,     when     the slurry   of   Comparative   Example    1   was   coated   in   an   anode foil,   the physical   properties   of   the   slurry  were  so  poor that    clogging    of    masses     and    settling    of    the    coating slurry   caused   by   poor   dispersion   were    generated    to    the extent   that  it is  impossible   to   coat. [Comparative Example  2]<br>
Electrode slurry was prepared as described in Example 1, except that the amount of CMC used as a thickener is increased by 2 wt%, i.e., from 1 wt% to 3 wt% and PEO-2MMA copolymer used as a dispersant was not added. The viscosity was measured under the same range of shear rates. The results are shown in FIG. 5.<br>
When  the  amount   of  CMC   was   increased   from  1   wt%   to 3   wt%   without   adding   a    dispersant,    a    viscosity   profile similar  to  that of  Example   1   was   shown,    and  thus  it  seems that  the  electrode  slurry was   well  dispersed. [Experiment  on  cell  performance]<br>
Each of Anode slurries obtained from Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 was applied and coated on a copper foil to form an anode. LiCoCoO2 as a cathode active material, PE/PP/PE as a separator and EC/PC/DEC, in which LiPF6was dissolved, as an electrolyte solution were used<br>
r.o manufacture a can-type lithiurn secondary cell. An experiment for measuring a cell capacity vs. a charge/discharge rate was performed. The results are shown in FIG. 6.<br>
As     can    be    seen     from     FIG.     6,     the     anode     slurry-obtained     from    Comparative     Example     2     had    an    increased weight    ratio    of   CMC   used    as    a     thickener    based    on    the total   weight   of   the  anode-forming  components,    compared   to Example   1,   and  thus   the  weight   ratio   of   the   anode   active material   was   reduced  and   the   theoretical   capacity   of  the lithium  secondary cell  was   also  reduced.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As     described     above,      according     to     the     present invention,    by   adding   a   specific   dispersant   to   electrode active   material   slurry  in   a   small   amount,    it   is   possible to     improve      the     dispersibility      of      electrode     active material   slurry,    to   stabilize   the    viscosity   of   electrode active   material   slurry,   to   distribute   an   active  material and  a   conductive  agent  uniformly,    to   decrease   the   amount of a  thickener,   to  increase  the  solid  content   ratio   of an electrode     active    material,      and      to     increase     a      cell capacity.<br>
While      this      invention      has      been      described      in connection   with   what   is   presently   considered   to   be   the most   practical    and    preferred    embodiment,     it    is    to    be understood    that    the    invention    is    not    limited    to     the disclosed     embodiment     and      the     drawings,      but,      on      the contrary,    it    is    intended   to    cover    various   modifications and     variations     within    the      spirit     and     scope     of      the appended  claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
