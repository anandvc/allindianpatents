				<td>PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT OF WASTEWATERS AND<br>
SEWAGE<br>
The present invention provides means for biodegrading the organic<br>
pollutants present in wastewaters and for preventing the formation of<br>
agglomerates along the sewer pipes.<br>
More specifically, the invention provides a biodegradable solid support<br>
carrying a mixture of non-pathogenic bacteria that synergistically cooperate in<br>
decomposing the organic pollutants present in toilet wastewaters and in<br>
sewage collection and processing tanks, including the organic agglomerates<br>
which lead to blockages along sewer pipes.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The problem of effectively degrading the organic substances contained<br>
in wastewaters and sewage has been long felt. Besides to evidently causing<br>
hygienic problems, such organic substances are also responsible for the<br>
formation of encrustations and therefore of serious damages in time, along<br>
domestic pipelines to drainpipes.<br>
Biological and chemical products are currently used to safeguard the<br>
integrity and good state of pipelines to drainpipes; in many cases such<br>
products may result either harmful to the user or scarcely effective in<br>
eliminating the substances responsible for pipe blockage and sewage sludge<br>
accumulation.<br>
State of the art<br>
The patent application WO00/01621 discloses biological means for<br>
sanitary drainage of polluted effluents and/or maintenance of a sewer pipe<br>
system for evacuating said effluents, characterised in that it comprises at least<br>
a biodegradable support, particularly bioactive toilet paper loaded with a<br>
composition of saprophytic bacteria belonging to at least one of the species<br><br>
Bacillus subtilis, Rhodococcus rubica, Rhodococcus rubra, Pseudomonas<br>
putida, Pseudomonas putrefaciens.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The invention provides an optimised bacterial composition which<br>
proved safe, non-pathogenic when contacted with either intact or lacerated<br>
human body tissues, particularly effective in decomposing the organic<br>
pollutants that are present in the wastewater collection and transport pipes,<br>
and which can be applied to a biodegradable solid support, especially toilet<br>
paper, maintaining unaltered biodegradation activity upon storage for long<br>
periods of time and under disparate environmental conditions. The bacterial<br>
composition consists of five sporogenous strains of the genus Bacillus, which<br>
synergistically cooperate in the biodegradation of organic pollutants present in<br>
the wastewaters. The bacteria, or preferably their spores, are deposited on a<br>
, biodegradable support and become active upon contact with water, thereby<br>
initiating the process of biological degradation of the organic pollutants. In<br>
particular, the activated bacteria produce enzymes that penetrate in depth into<br>
the organic agglomerates present in the wastewater pipes and/or collection<br>
tanks, promoting their decomposition into carbon dioxide and water. The<br>
bacteria mixture according to the invention has demonstrated a high<br>
synergistic biodegradation activity on wastewater from toilet pipes, also<br>
preventing the formation of large agglomerates which lead to blockages along<br>
sewer pipes and considerably reducing the organic pollutant content present in<br>
collection and processing tanks (trap tanks, septic tanks, Imhoff tanks,<br>
cesspools, seepage trenches etc.).<br>
Accordingly, in a first embodiment the invention is directed to a<br>
product for the biodegradation of the organic substances contained in<br>
wastewaters from toilets, pipes and in sewage collection tanks, said product<br>
comprising a biodegradable solid support carrying a mixture of bacterial<br><br>
strains of the genus Bacillus, species subtilis, licheniformis, megaterium,<br>
polymyxa and circulans. The bacterial strains, preferably in the spore state,<br>
may be applied onto the biodegradable support in a liquid medium, preferably<br>
in form of solution or suspension in water optionally containing additives (e.g.<br>
stabilisers) and co-solvents. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
bacterial spores are used at a concentration of 106 to 109 CFU (colonies<br>
forming units) per ml. The bacterial mixtures have preferably the following<br>
quantitative composition: B. subtilis from 20 to 30%, B. licheniformis from 10<br>
to 20%, B. megaterium from 10 to 20%, B. polymyxa from 20 to 30%, and<br>
B. circulans from 10 to 20%. Any bacterial strain of the indicated species may<br>
be used in accordance with the invention, irrespective of its origin or natural<br>
source.<br>
The biodegradable support is preferably made of pure cellulose or of a<br>
cellulose derivative, e.g. recycled paper, de-inked paper, synthetic materials or<br>
non-woven fabrics; examples of cellulose or cellulose-derived products that<br>
can be used according to the invention include handkerchiefs, serviettes,<br>
napkins, diapers, sanitary towels, absorbing papers and preferably toilet paper.<br>
When the product is in form of toilet paper, a liquid culture of bacteria can be<br>
applied to at least one surface thereof by a process of spraying or coating, as<br>
described in further detail below. The same process can be used for other<br>
supports, if necessary with modifications depending on the shape, thickness,<br>
tensile strength, breakage resistance, loading capacity and other structural and<br>
mechanical characteristics of the support. Anyone skilled in the art will be<br>
able to determine the better conditions depending on the particular support and<br>
on the apparatus used for its manufacturing.<br>
In addition to the bacteria, the biodegradable support may contain further<br>
ingredients including softening agents, surface-active agents, perfumes, dyes.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention relates to the use of a<br><br>
biodegradable solid support carrying the bacteria mixture described above, for<br>
degrading the organic substances contained in wastewaters and sewage, and for<br>
eliminating the organic agglomerates and the unpleasant odours that form in the<br>
wastewater pipes and collection tanks.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of the bacterial composition<br>
The bacterial composition (hereafter indicated as B.A.T.P.L1700S) is an<br>
aqueous suspension of spores of the following bacterial strains:<br>
o Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), Gram-positive, mesophilic, aerobic,<br>
produces endospores that are highly resistant even in environments<br>
which are not very favourable to biological growth, and produces a<br>
large variety of enzymes (protease and beta-glucanase) specific for<br>
sugars and starches.<br>
o Bacillus Licheniformis (ATCC 12713), Gram-positive, mesophilic,<br>
anaerobic, sporogenous, produces protease, amylase and lipase,<br>
specific for breaking down fats, resistant in environments with high<br>
concentrations of NaCl (up to 7%), denitrifying activity in anaerobic<br>
conditions, also grows at high temperatures (up to 50°C).<br>
o Bacillus Megaterium (ATCC 14581), Gram-positive, mesophilic,<br>
aerobic, sporogenous, produces α,β5-amylase enzymes specific for<br>
breaking down starches, protease for casein, resistant in environments<br>
with high concentrations of NaCl (up to 7%).<br>
o Bacillus Polymyxa (ATCC 842) Gram-positive, mesophilic, anaerobic,<br>
sporogenous, produces cellulase and hemicellulase specific for<br>
breaking down cellulose and paper, nitrifying activity.<br>
o Bacillus Circulans (ATCC 9500) Gram-positive, mesophilic,<br>
facultative anaerobic, sporogenous, produces protease, chitinase and<br>
pectinase, specific enzymes for breaking down plant derivatives, fibres<br><br>
and paper, resistant to high temperatures (up to 50°C).<br>
ATCC = American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA<br>
The biological product has the following characteristics:<br>
APPEARANCE: cloudy liquid<br>
COLOUR: straw yellow<br>
pH: 8.2-8.8<br>
DENSITY: 1000-1025 g/cm3<br>
STABILISER: propylene glycol<br>
CFU/ml:100 x l07<br>
SAFETY: there is no risk, even in the event of improper use, such as<br>
swallowing, handling or contact, even with the genitals.<br>
The bacteria count of 1 billion per g was specifically chosen to allow an<br>
appropriate application of product to each cm2 of toilet paper; this count ensures<br>
a correct input of the bacterial pool into the sewers without damaging the toilet<br>
paper during manufacture of the roll.<br>
The product is used in liquid form with or without added enzymes,<br>
perfumed, in aqueous emulsion or solvent.<br>
Example 2 - Study of the efficacy of the individual bacterial strains in<br>
a sewer system<br>
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the biodegradation<br>
activity of the micro-organisms contained in the biological product<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S is greater than that obtained by micro-organisms belonging to<br>
each type of bacterial strain taken separately. The test was conducted in a<br>
simulated sewer system by observing the variation in COD (Chemical Oxygen<br>
Demand) determined in a sample of water containing chemically oxidisable<br>
organic substances. The tests were conducted in parallel with a simulated sewer<br>
system with no biological treatment, subjected to the same experimental<br>
conditions.<br><br>
The determination of the COD value in the wastewater provides a<br>
quantitative measurement of the presence of pollutant organic compounds. The<br>
reduction in COD caused by the micro-organisms is therefore a good indicator<br>
of the efficacy of the product used.<br>
Procedure:<br>
3.5 litres of water containing 3 g of sugar (source of carbon) and 3 g of<br>
nutrient compound (source of N.P.K. : 12 : 5 : 10) was prepared.<br>
The solution was divided into seven 0.5 litre containers (A, B, etc.).<br>
The COD of the solution was measured prior to treatment (after<br>
decanting for 1 h). The value found corresponds to the basal COD value for<br>
each sample.<br>
The samples were kept under agitation (at very low speed) and at a<br>
constant temperature of 35°C. After agitation a sheet of toilet paper was added<br>
to each container.<br>
Each sample was treated every day for 15 days as follows:<br>
10 ml of water in container A<br>
10 ml of Bacillus Subtilis 20xl06 in container B<br>
10 ml of Bacillus Licheniformis 20x 106 in container C<br>
10 ml of Bacillus Megaterium 20x 106 in container D<br>
10 ml of Bacillus Polymyxa 20x 106 in container E<br>
10 ml of Bacillus Circulans 20x 106 in container F<br>
1 ml of B.A.T.P.L1700S 1x109 in container G.<br>
After treatment, each sample was subjected to agitation at very low<br>
speed for 10 min/day. Finally, a sheet of toilet paper was added.<br>
The COD measurement and the treatment (T) were performed according<br>
to the following pattern:<br><br><br>
The sample for COD determination was taken after leaving the<br>
solutions to stand for 1 h (without agitation). The sample was taken approx.<br>
1 cm from the base of the container, taking care to avoid the solid component<br>
deposited and/or in suspension.<br>
Results<br><br><br>
(* *) The maximum COD value detectable with the method used is<br>
3500; for samples which fell outside this limit, the value of 3500 mg/L was<br>
conventionally indicated.<br><br>
Remarks<br>
To demonstrate that biodegradation of the micro-organisms contained in<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S is more effective than that of the individual bacterial strains,<br>
7 identical simulated sewer systems with a known COD (basal value of<br>
1850 mg/litre) were prepared.<br>
A sheet of toilet paper was added to each sample for 15 consecutive<br>
days and the treatment described above under "procedure" was performed.<br>
The corresponding COD was measured every 3 days.<br>
The percentage reductions in pollutant content for each treated sample<br>
compared with sample A (untreated = water) were calculated on the basis of<br>
the results obtained (Table a). The graph of Fig. 1 shows the total percentage<br>
reductions by the 5 strains (white bar) and the corresponding reduction by<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S (grey bar). Table a) indicates that:<br>
1) in a sewer system, in the absence of biological treatment (sample A),<br>
the COD tends to increase with time, ie. the concentration of chemically<br><br>
oxidisable organic substances (pollutants) increases.<br>
2)	in a sewer system, the presence of a biological treatment reduces the<br>
COD over time, ie. the concentration of chemically oxidisable organic<br>
substances (pollutants) is reduced by the degradation action of the<br>
micro-organisms. The different COD reduction percentages found, indicating<br>
different breakdown activities, are evidently dependent on the specificity of<br>
the enzymes produced by the bacteria. This specificity distinguishes each<br>
strain selected, and also depends on the more or less favourable environmental<br>
conditions of the sewer system. Under our conditions the most resistant<br>
strains, B. Subtilis and B. Polymyxa, demonstrated a more constant activity<br>
over time, which was superior in percentage terms to that of the other strains.<br>
3)	when treated with B.A.T.P.L1700S, the COD of the system decreases<br>
significantly over time due to the biodegradation activity of the<br>
micro-organisms belonging to all 5 strains contained in the product; in the<br>
presence of organic substances and favourable environmental conditions these<br>
micro-organisms become active, feed and reproduce, reducing the pollutant<br>
levels from 1850 on the first day to 488 on the last, namely a reduction of<br>
86%.<br>
The graph of Fig. 1 clearly shows that the biodegradation activity<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S in the sewer system is superior to the sum of the activities of<br>
the 5 strains taken individually.<br>
Example 3 - Study of the efficacy of B.A.T.P.L1700S in a sewer<br>
system<br>
The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy of<br>
biodegradation of the micro-organisms contained in B.A.T.P.L1700S in a<br>
simulated sewer system, by observing the variations in COD (Chemical<br>
Oxygen Demand) determined in a sample of water containing chemically<br>
oxidisable organic substances. This efficacy was compared with that of a<br><br>
product already on the market, namely WC Net Fosse Biologiche, a<br>
bacteria-based powder with a CFU count of 200 million per g, and compared<br>
with a system without biological treatment.<br>
The determination of the COD value in the wastewater provides a<br>
quantitative measurement of the presence of pollutant organic compounds.<br>
The reduction in COD caused by the micro-organisms is therefore a good<br>
indicator of the efficacy of the product used.<br>
Procedure:<br>
1 litre of water containing 1 g of sugar (source of carbon) and 1 g of<br>
nutrient compound (source of N.P.K. : 12 : 5 : 10) was prepared.<br>
The solution was divided between three 0.5 litre containers (A, B and C).<br>
Prior to treatment, the COD of the solution was measured (after<br>
decanting for 1 h); the value found corresponds to the basal COD value for<br>
each sample.<br>
The 3 samples were maintained under agitation (at a very low speed)<br>
and at a constant temperature of 35°C.<br>
sample B: treated with 0.21 µL(*) of B.A.T.P.L1700S on 1/4 sheet of<br>
toilet paper (approx. 25 cm2).<br>
Sample C: treated every 5 days with 5 ml of a solution consisting of<br>
125 mg of WC Net in 500 ml, prepared according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions.<br>
1 sheet of paper with B.A.T.P.L1700S was inserted in sample B, and 1<br>
sheet of untreated paper in sample A and sample C, every day for 15<br>
consecutive days.<br>
Sample A: treated every 5 days with 5 ml water.<br>
After treatment, each sample was agitated at very low speed for<br>
10 min/day.<br>
The COD measurement, the addition of the toilet paper (F) and the<br><br>
treatment (T) were performed according to the following pattern:<br><br>
The sample for the determination of COD was taken after leaving the<br>
solutions to stand for 1 h (without agitation); the sample was taken on the<br>
surface, at a depth of approx. 1 cm, avoiding the bacterial component and<br>
solids in suspension.<br>
(*) dose equal to 5 g / 60m2 of toilet paper<br><br>
Results<br><br>
(**) The maximum COD value obtainable with the method used is<br>
3500; for samples exceeding this limit, the value of 3500 mg/l was<br>
conventionally indicated.<br>
Remarks<br>
To demonstrate the efficacy of biodegradation of the micro-organisms<br>
contained in B.A.T.P.L1700S and compare it with that of a known product, 3<br>
identical simulated sewer systems with a known COD were prepared.<br>
A sheet of toilet paper was added to each sample for 15 consecutive<br>
days: untreated for samples A and C, treated with B.A.T.P.L1700S for sample<br>
B, as described under "Procedure". Samples A and C were treated every 5<br>
days with water and "WC Net Fosse Biologiche" respectively at the dose<br>
stated above. The corresponding COD was measured every 3 days.<br>
The results obtained were recorded on the graph of FIG. 2; the line that<br>
statistically interpolates all the values obtained ("trend line"), was calculated<br>
for each set of data corresponding to each sample. The graph indicates that:<br>
1)	In a sewer system, in the absence of biological treatment (sample<br>
A), the COD tends to increase with time, ie. the concentration of chemically<br>
oxidisable organic substances (pollutants) increases.<br>
2)	The treatment performed with "WC Net Fosse Biologiche"<br><br>
proved ineffective; paradoxically, a trend line of higher COD values was<br>
observed in sample A.<br>
3) In the case of treatment with B.A.T.P.L1700S, the COD of the<br>
system declined over time due to the biodegradation activity of the<br>
micro-organisms contained in the product; in the presence of organic<br>
substances and favourable environmental conditions these micro-organisms<br>
become active, feed and reproduce, reducing the pollutant levels.<br>
Macroscopic observation of the 3 samples with the naked eye also<br>
confirmed the results of the COD measurement.<br>
Each sample was photographed on the 10th day (FIG. 3).<br>
Sample A : cloudy supernatant liquid with particulate matter deposited<br>
on the base and intact sheets of paper still clearly evident and not<br>
decomposed.<br>
Sample B: supernatant liquid clearer than in A, homogenous particulate<br>
matter deposited on the base, paper is decomposed.<br>
Sample C: cloudy liquid, floating particulate part containing the sheets<br>
of intact paper, still clearly evident, and mould formation.<br>
Photos taken on the 15th day (FIG. 4):<br>
Sample A: Supernatant liquid cloudy, large deposits on the base and<br>
toilet paper still clearly distinguishable, mould formation.<br>
Sample B: Homogenous supernatant liquid, toilet paper broken down<br>
and dissolved, thick but homogenous deposits on the base, no formation of<br>
mould and/or<br>
Sample C: supernatant liquid cloudy, large deposits on the base and<br>
toilet paper still clearly distinguishable, mould formation.<br>
Example 4 - Evaluation of the optimum cfu/(cm2 of paper) ratio<br>
Domestic use<br>
On the assumption that the average weekly consumption of toilet paper<br><br>
by a family of four is approx. 5 rolls, and that each roll is approx. 19m long<br>
and 10 cm wide, approx. 9.5 m2 (1900 cm x 10cm x 5 rolls = 95000 cm2) of<br>
toilet paper a week is discharged into the sewers.<br>
The correct load of bacterial strains into the sewer pipes of such a<br>
family has been calculated at 2,000 million CFU/week to activate and<br>
maintain the process of decomposition of the organic substances, eliminate<br>
unpleasant odours and fully dissolve the cellulose particles.<br>
The amount obtained, namely 2,000 million CFU, equal to 2 g of the<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S product, must be deposited on 9.5 m2 of toilet paper.<br>
Use in communities<br>
On the assumption that the average weekly toilet paper consumption of<br>
a hotel with 20 double rooms, namely 40 guests, is approx. 40 rolls, and that<br>
each roll is approx. 19 m long and 10 cm wide, approx. 76 m2 (190 cm x<br>
10 cm x 40 rolls = 760000cm2) of toilet paper a week is discharged into the<br>
sewers.<br>
The correct load of bacterial strains into the sewer pipes of such a hotel<br>
has been calculated at 25,000 million CFU/week to activate and maintain the<br>
process of decomposition of the organic substances, eliminate unpleasant<br>
odours and fully dissolve the cellulose particles.<br>
The amount obtained, namely 25,000 million CFU, equal to 25 g of the<br>
B.A.T.P.L1700S product invented, must be deposited on 76 m2 of toilet paper.<br>
Example 5 - application of bacteria to paper<br>
The product can be applied to toilet paper by two methods: spraying or<br>
coating.<br>
The spraying apparatus can be installed in the converting unit (where<br>
the finished paper is bonded, cut and packaged) or the final part of the paper<br>
mill, where the finished paper is rewound and sent to the converting unit for<br>
subsequent processing.<br><br>
The spraying application in the converting unit takes place at the "paper<br>
passage point" before "embossing and gluing", "DESL" or "tip-to-tip",<br>
depending on the type of processing selected. The plant is situated<br>
immediately before the sheet bonding process.<br>
In the paper mill the apparatus is positioned at the point preceding the<br>
sheet bonding stage and after the roll rewinding stage, called the "big roll"<br>
stage.<br>
The spray application system comprises nozzles that spray (according to<br>
the speed of the machine) a quantity of product sufficient to cover the entire<br>
length of the final roll.<br>
The nozzles operate by collision of 2 converging jets, one of compressed air<br>
and the other of bacterial product, to a create a jet consisting of particles with an<br>
average diameter of under 10 microns. The system includes a storage tank for the<br>
bacterial product under agitation, a feed pump, 1-5 atomiser nozzles, depending on<br>
the aperture and speed of the machine (converting unit or rewinder), a screen that<br>
conveys the jet into the two layers, management software, and a system that<br>
controls the quantity delivered on the basis of the number of machine revolutions<br>
(acceleration or slowing of the speed of the machine).<br>
If the spray method is used, our biological product can be combined<br>
with the dose of softener following a biocompatibility test.<br>
In the coating application system (the rotogravure type of flexographic<br>
system) the product is taken up by a "honeycomb" steel roller with<br>
microperforations which passes over a subsequent roller, and distributes the<br>
bacterial product on the paper. This type of application can be used in the<br>
converting unit at the final stage in the paper mill, or at the place where the<br>
