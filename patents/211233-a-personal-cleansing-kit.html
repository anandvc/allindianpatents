COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
CUSTOMIZED PERSONAL CLEANSING SYGTEM K1T<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
PCT/EP2003/013569<br><br><br>
CUSTOMIZED PERSONAL CLEANSING SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a personal cleansing system and a personal cleansing kit, and more specifically wherein an assembly of one or more of skin cleansing, aesthetic, and skin moisturization and benefit bars are selected, and then combined in a customized manner.<br>
Toilet bar skin cleaning properties are well known.  An ideal bar composition not only cleans, but provides a large quantity of lather and leaves the skin feeling comfortable. Consumers also desire to obtain toilet bars with good hardness, low mush, and that contain appealing fragrances and one or more skin benefit agents and emollients for 15  moisturizing and treating the skin according to individual preferences and needs.<br>
To accomplish this, a wide variety of additives have been suggested for inclusion in toilet bars.  Some additives enhance the physical properties of the bar such as lather volume, hardness and wear rate.  Other additives effect the aesthetic and sensory properties of the bar.  Still other additives enhance skin moisturization, residual antibacterial properties, and treat skin conditions such as 25      acne, etc.  Unfortunately not all potentially desirable<br>
additives may be compatible with each other.  As a result, a single toilet bar product is not suitable or desirable for every consumer.  At the same time, the bar manufacturer desires to reduce costs by minimizing the difference in toilet bar compositions it produces.<br>
2-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The use of a porous or netted bag or pouch to carry soap is known.  The prior art includes US 1,682,119 where a bag is provided with soap in a flake or fragment form.  Similarly US 2,607,940 discloses a mesh bag so that a soap can be .5  easily inserted.  Similar arrangements are taught in e.g. US Patent No. 3,167,805, US Patent No. 4,190,550, US Patent No. 4,228,834, US Patent No. 4,480,939, and US Patent No. 5,462,378.  US Patent No. 4,789,262 teaches a soap holding cleaning pad.  US Patent No. 5,839,842 discloses a cleansing :.0  system with a toilet bar and a sponge in a porous pouch.  US Patent No. 6,042,288 teaches the use of a synthetic detergent bar and a pouf for holding the bar.  JP Patent No. 10137152 also teaches a solid soap in an expansible net. However, the problem with prior art toilet bar and pouch implements is the lack of a system and a kit to make available a product with a wide range of sensory properties in a convenient format but with excellent physical properties.<br>
20  Surprisingly it has been found that when a single toilet bar is formulated with high levels of moisturizing and aesthetic fragrance ingredients, the properties of the bar such as lather, wear rate, etc. are substantially degraded compared to a system of individual toilet bar ingredients formulated separately where a cleansing bar, a moisturizing bar, and an aesthetic fragrance bar are separately produced.  For the purposes of this invention, a "bar" is herein defined as an individual toilet bar or other geometrically or amorphous shaped body that may be selected from and combined with<br>
30  other toilet bars or bodies in a porous holder according to the invention.  According to the present invention, these<br>
3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
separate bars may be presented in a kit and combined in a porous pouch to bring together all the cleansing and skin treatment attributes desired by the consumer and at the same time form a useful cleansing implement with superior lathering properties compared to a single toilet bar formed with the same ingredients.  Furthermore it has been found that production efficiency is enhanced by making the bars separately, since such bars if made by the melt cast process have a shorter solidification time.  Moreover, the variability of solidification time in melt cast bars may be minimized by separate manufacturing of the bars.  With respect to extrusion of such bars, the variability of processing parameters such as extrusion rate and stampability may also be minimized by separate manufacture of the bars.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleansing kit including:<br>
20  a.   a container;<br>
b.	a closable receptacle formed of a porous material;<br>
c.	a plurality of solid or semi-solid bars held outside<br>
25      the receptacle in the container including a first bar<br>
having a cleansing composition and a second bar having second composition selected from an aesthetic composition, a skin benefit composition or a combined aesthetic benefit composition; wherein the cleansing and second compositions differ from each other; and<br>
4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
d.   wherein the cleansing composition contains a surfactant selected from a synthetic anionic surfactant, a soap, and a blend thereof in a concentration greater than about 5 % by wt., preferably greater than about 10 % by wt., and the second composition contains an aesthetic ingredient, a skin benefit ingredient and a blend thereof; the aesthetic or benefit ingredient being present in a concentration that is greater than the concentration of the same ingredient in the cleansing l0      composition.<br>
As used herein, the aesthetic ingredient is defined as either fragrances, colorants, pigments, cosmetics (without benefit ingredients as hereafter defined), suspended bodies and blends thereof; and the benefit ingredient is defined as either emollients, skin active materials (as defined below) and blends thereof.<br>
In another aspect of the invention is a system for providing a personal customized cleansing product to a user, including the steps of:<br>
a.  providing a selection of a plurality of bars including a first bar having a cleansing composition, and a second bar having second composition selected from an aesthetic composition, a skin benefit composition or a combined aesthetic and benefit composition; wherein the cleansing and second compositions differ from each other; and<br>

5<br><br><br><br>
WO 200^58^6^	PCTYEE20&amp;3*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
b.	wherein the cleansing composition contains a surfactant<br>
selected from a synthetic anionic surfactant, a s"oap,<br>
and a blend thereof in a combined concentration greater<br>
than about 5 % by wt. "(preferably greater than about 10<br>
% by wt.) and the second composition contains an<br>
aesthetic ingredient, a skin benefit ingredient and a<br>
blend thereof; the aesthetic or benefit ingredient<br>
being present in a concentration that is greater than<br>
the concentration of the same ingredient in the<br>
cleansing composition.<br>
c.	providing a closable receptacle formed of a porous<br>
material to contain the plurality of solid cosmetic<br>
bars; and<br>
d.	allowing the user to select and insert the first and<br>
second bars inside the closable receptacle to form a<br>

propylene oxide and ethylenediamine.  Other so-called nonionic detergent compounds include long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine  oxides  and dialkyl sulphoxide, and the like.<br>
The nonionic may also be a sugar amide, such as a polysaccharide amide.  Specifically, the surfactant may be one of the lactobionamides described in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,279 to Au et al. titled "Compositions Comprising 10  Nonionic Glycolipid Surfactants issued February 14, 1995;<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference or it may be one of the sugar amides described in US Patent No. 5,009,814 to Kelkenberg, titled "Use of N-Poly Hydroxyalkyl Fatty Acid Amides as Thickening Agents for Liquid Aqueous Surfactant Systems" issued April 23,   1991;  hereby incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br>
Nonionic surfactants may be usefully employed in the cleansing bar of the present invention in the concentration range of about 0 to 30 % by wt., preferably in the concentration range of about 1 % to 20 % by wt.<br>
One or more cationic surfactants may also be used in the inventive toilet bar composition.<br>
5<br>
Examples of cationic detergents are the quaternary ammonium compounds such as alkyldimethylammonium halogenides.<br>
Cationic surfactants may be usefully employed in the 30  cleansing bar of the present invention in the concentration 16<br><br><br><br>
WCU^##026	PCTVEP2H03*)<br><br><br>
range of about 0 to 3 0 % by wt., preferably in the concentration range of about 1 % to 20 % by wt.<br>
Other suitable surfactants which may be used are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,723,325 to Parran Jr. titled "Detergent Compositions Containing Particle Deposition Enhancing Agents" issued March, 27, 1973; and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I &amp; II) by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, both of which are also incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br>
In addition, at least one of the bar compositions may be an aesthetic agent bar and may include fragrances, colorants, pigments, particles, suspended materials, blends thereof, and the like.  When they are employed, fragrances are advantageously used in the range of about 0.1 % to 10 % by wt., colorants in the range of about 0.000001 % to 1 % by wt., and particles/suspended materials in the range of about 0.01 % to 10 % by wt.<br>
Preferably the bars employed in the inventive article may be differentiated from each other by different colorants, where the color signifies a specific attribute to be conferred by the bar or where color is used as a descriptor of the bar.<br>
The personal cleansing article of the present invention may contain toilet bar compositions that contain a safe and effective amount of a benefit agent.  This benefit agent may be selected from water-soluble active agents, oil soluble active agents, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and mixtures thereof.  The term "benefit agent" as used herein<br>
17<br><br><br><br>
	PQ0*2OO5/5l3S69<br><br>
means personal care actives that can be used to deliver a benefit to the skin and/or hair.

25<br><br>
WO 2004/8026	PCT/EP2003/013569<br>
the pouch and transfer the contents of the toilet bars that are either dissolved, dispersed, or suspended in the water to the user.  Preferably the pouch material is sufficiently water insoluble so that maintains its integrity until the toilet bars are substantially used up.  Useful materials include polymeric mesh, woven or nonwoven fabric, paper, tissue, sponge or laminate of foam and fabric.<br>
Advantageously, a light-weight polymeric meshed substrate ^0  may be used.  A useful material is an extruded tubular<br>
netting mesh, particularly prepared from polyolefins such as polyethylene and the like, and other materials such as polyamides or polyesters and the like.  They may be single or multiple ply netting such as in a pouf.  The mesh 15  structure may be polygonal, such as  diamond shaped, or  the like.  Also suitable are irregular shapes.  Advantageously the pouch cells are open and that preferably the contents within the pouch are observable from the exterior.<br>
20  Optionally sponge like materials may also be included in the pouch.  Useful sponge materials are closed cell materials either of synthetic or natural origin^  Synthetic sponges are advantageously formed of foamed polyurethane and the like.  Optionally the sponge material may be shaped to resemble an aesthetic form or be adapted to hold one or more of the toilet bars.<br>
Examples of suitable non-woven substrates useful as pouch materials would be wet-laid, dry-laid, spun bonded, 30  hydroentangled, air-laid, and the like comprising either singly or in admixture fibers such as cellulose, rayon.<br>
26<br><br><br>
polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyamide, and the like.  The term substrate also includes naturally occurring materials such as animal skin e.g. chamois leathers and the like.  Preferred embodiments employ non-woven substrates since they are economical and readily available in a variety of materials.  By non-woven is meant that the layer is comprised of fibers which are not woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a sheet, particularly a tissue.  The fibers can either be random (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded {i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one direction).  Furthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of materials both natural and synthetic.  By "natural" is meant that the materials are derived from plants, animals, insects or byproducts.  By  synthetic" is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any of the common synthetic or natural textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of natural materials useful as a pouch material in the present invention are silk fibers, keratin fibers and cellulosic fibers.  Non-limiting examples of keratin fibers include those selected from wool fibers, camel hair fibers, and the like.  Non-limiting examples of cellulosic fibers include those selected from wood pulp fibers, cotton fibers, hemp fibers, jute fibers, flax fibers, and mixtures thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
Non-limiting examples of synthetic materials useful as components in the present invention include those selected from acetate fibers, acrylic fibers, cellulose ester fibers, modacrylic fibers, polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, rayon fibers and mixtures thereof.  Examples of some of these synthetic<br>
materials include acrylics such as  Acrilan®, Creslan®, and<br>
the acrylonitrile-based fiber, Orion®; cellulose ester<br>
1<br>
fibers such as cellulose acetate, Arnel®, and Acele®; polyamides such as Nylons (e.g., Nylon 6, Nylon 66, Nylon 610 and the like; polyesters such as Fortrel®, Kodel®, and<br>
the polyethylene terephthalate fibers, Dacron®; polyolefins<br>
such as polypropylene, polyethylene; polyvinyl acetate 15  fibers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-woven substrates made from natural materials consist of webs or sheets most commonly formed on a fine wire screen from a liquid suspension of the fibers.  Substrates made 20  from natural materials useful in the present invention can be obtained from a wide variety of commercial sources.<br>
Suitable pouch materials may include at least one apertured fabric, where a pattern is created by a network of bundled fiber segments surrounding apertures or holes; or in a contiguous nonwoven web which has been apertured or provided with slits or other openings.  In one preferred embodiment, the water insoluble matterial is a substantially contiguous network of water insoluble fibers having a plurality of<br><br><br><br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
macroscopic openings.  A macroscopic opening is defined as an opening that is large relative to the intrinsic pore size of the water insoluble material.<br>
In a typical spunbond or bonded carded web, for example, a macroscopic opening would appear to the eye to be a deliberately introduced hole or void in the web, rather than a characteristic pore between adjacent fibers, and specifically could have a characteristic width or major axis diameter of about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm, or larger; preferably about 1 mm to about 5 mm.  A useful characteristic width may be defined as 4 times the area of the aperture divided by the perimeter.  Useful fabric aperture densities are about 10 to 700 per square inch, preferably about 20 to 500 per square inch.<br><br>
As discussed above, the nonwoven web may be made from synthetic fibers, as is known in the art, and may be a spunbond web, a meltblown web, a bonded carded web, or other 2b      fibrous nonwoven structures known in the art.<br>
For example, a polyester nonwoven web such as a low basis weight spunbond material could be provided with apertures through pin aperturing; perf embossing and mechanical<br>
25  stretching of the web; die punching or stamping to provide apertures or holes in the web; hydroentangling to impart apertures by rearrangement of the fibers due to the interaction of water jets with the fibrous web as it resides on a patterned, textured or three-dimensional substrate that<br>
30  imparts a pattern to the web; water knives that cut out desired apertures or holes in the web; laser cutters that<br><br><br><br><br>
cut out portions of the web; patterned forming techniques, such as air laying of synthetic fibers on a patterned substrate to impart macroscopic openings; needle punching with sets of barbed needles to engage and displace fibers; £  and other methods known in the art.  Preferably, the<br>
openings are provided in a regular pattern over at least a portion of the pouch.<br>
The pouch of the present invention can comprise two or more portions, each having a different texture and abrasiveness. The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate 15  portions of the pouch can be manufactured to have different permanent colors thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces.<br><br>

Examples<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word  about".<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br><br>

The example illustrated in table 1 represents an inventive three part kit divided into cleansing, benefits, and fragrances type bars as major categories, and a closable porous pouch to contain a user selection of the bars.  Each major bar category in Table 1 is further divided into subcategories representing different specific functions, benefits, or aesthetic attributes.  Examples of specific ingredients present in the subcategory compositions are also illustrated, e.g. where the Benefits bar includes separate subcategories identified as Nourishing, Anti-aging, Moisturizing, Smoothing, Silkening, and Hydrating; and wherein e.g. the Nourishing Benefits bar contains vitamins E, A, C and Jojoba and Macademia Nut oil as their specific benefit ingredients.<br>
The kit could contain bars from one or more of the categories.  A set of instructions is also preferably provided with the kit instructing the user of the kit in how to assemble the cleansing article that meets the users needs.<br><br>
