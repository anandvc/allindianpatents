				<td>System for connecting of supply lines<br>
Specification<br>
The invention concerns a system for connecting of supply lines between a tractor and a semi-trailer which can be coupled to it, wherein a fifth wheel and an automated line coupling system with at least one jack connection is arranged on the tractor, and the semi-trailer has at least one power supply circuit, comprising a first supply console for connecting to the tractor, receiving a plug-in element arranged on at least one supply line of the tractor and/or a plug fashioned complementary to the jack connection.<br><br>
On most of the fifth wheels in use today, tractor and semi-trailer are joined together by flexible supply lines, by which an electrical and pneumatic supply is realized for the semi-trailer. What is more, it is also possible to provide control signals or a hydraulic supply of the semi-trailer by appropriate supply lines. The coupling of the supply lines is done by hand, in that a plug-in element located on the supply line is inserted at the first supply console. Before uncoupling the semi-trailer, the supply lines are separated and the loose plug-in elements are usually hung on parking plug strips arranged on the tractor and secured here for driving without a semi-trailer. Such a prior art is disclosed by GB 2 204 844 A.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to reduce the operating expenses, automated line coupling systems have become known, corresponding to DE 101 55 056 A1, and they have also come to be used to a significant degree. Such a system can comprise, for example, a plug-in wedge engaging with the center pin of the semi-trailer, which is introduced into the entry opening of the fifth wheel during the coupling operation. After this, a laterally movable jack connection is inserted into the plug-in wedge by motorized operation to bring about a contacting. In other systems, stationary mounted plug and socket come together by the coupling process of tractor and semi-trailer.<br>
It would be possible to entirely replace with these new automated line coupling systems the original, manually operated systems with one or more supply lines and a plug-in element located on each one of them, being connected to the first supply console. But this would require, for reasons of compatibility, that all tractors and semi-trailers of a fleet of trucks be fully retrofitted with automated line coupling systems. Otherwise, in<br>
mixed truck parks, it might happen that an already retrofitted tractor, for example, cannot supply power and control signals to a conventional semi-trailer.<br>
For this reason, the basic problem, of the invention is to provide a system for connecting of supply lines for tractors with an automated line coupling system, which likewise allows conventional semi-trailers to be mounted.<br>
The problem is solved according to the invention with a system in which a second supply console is arranged on the tractor, being constantly connected to the jack connection of the<br>
automated line coupling system, and the plug-in element can be optionally inserted at the first or second supply console.<br>
The second supply console largely corresponds in terms of structure to the first supply console, which is usually mounted on the front side of the semi-trailer. In the event that the tractor is expected to pull a semi-trailer likewise outfitted with a line coupling system, the supplying of the semi-trailer with power and signals, for example, occurs via the supply line and the plug-in element, located thereon, for the second supply console, and from there to the jack connection of the automated line coupling system, which in the coupled condition is already introduced into the plug on the semi-trailer side. The power or signal supply circuit of the semi-trailer will be fed from the plug.<br>
If, however, instead of this, it is necessary to haul a semi-trailer which does not have components of the automated line coupling system, the connecting of the supply line and the plug-in element located thereon can be removed from the second supply console and hooked up directly to the first supply console of the semi-trailer.<br>
Preferably a distributor with a first and second line branch is arranged in the supply circuit, wherein the first line branch is permanently connected to the first supply console and the second line branch to the plug.<br>
This has the benefit that semi-trailers so outfitted could be mounted both on tractors with a line coupling system and on conventionally outfitted tractors. In the case of conventionally outfitted tractors, the supply circuit is hooked up via the first supply console and the first line branch, for tractors with an automated line coupling system it is via the plug and the second line branch.<br>
A check valve should be arranged in the distributor and/or the first line branch and/or the second line branch, preventing pressurized air from flowing back from one line branch into the other.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the second supply console is connected by a permanent feed line to the jack connection. This is sturdier than a flexible hose or cable connection and it can also be laid on the tractor, with space advantages.<br>
Preferably, the second supply console is arrangd on the rear of the driver's cabin of the tractor.<br>
It has likewise proven to be advantageous to bring together several supply lines on a shared console and to connect the shared console to vehicle lines. The shared console should be oriented to the first supply console on the semi-trailer and in spatial proximity to it, that is, mounted at the same hejght on the tractor, opposite from there.<br>
In an especially favorable design embodiment, a transmission of electric power, compressed air, and/or control signals occurs via the at least one supply line and/or the automated line coupling system.<br>
In view of enhanced operating comfort, the second supply console can be set off to the side from the center axis of the vehicle within reach of an operator standing next to the tractor.<br>
For a better understanding, the invention shall be explained more closely hereafter by means of three drawings. These show:<br>
Fig. 1:	a schematic side view of a tractor and a semi-trailer with an<br>
automated line coupling system, shown enlarged;<br>
Fig. 2:	a view per Fig. 1 of a tractor outfitted with a line coupling system<br>
and a semi-trailer coupled to it, with no line coupling system; and<br>
Fig. 3:	a view of a tjactoc and a semi-trailer per Fig. 1 with a first and<br>
second line branch.<br>
Figure 1 shows in a schematic side view a tractor 2 and a semi-trailer 3 fastened to it via a fifth wheel 4 and a center pin 19  Several consumers are arranged on the semitrailer 3, which have to be supplied with electric power and compressed air. The consumers include electrically operated support jacks 22, arranged in pairs, which receive control signals from the tractor 2 via a bus system, not otherwise shown; a semi-trailer brake 23; and a pneumatic shock absorption 24.<br>
The tractor 2 and the semi-trailer 3 are both outfitted with an automated line coupling system 5, which in the present case comprises the components shown enlarged on the fifth wheel 4. The semi-trailer 3 is mechanically connected via the center pin 19 fixed in the fifth wheel 4 to the tractor 2. The center pin 19 engages with a swiveling plug wedge 20, which projects downward from a wedge-shaped entry opening (not shown) of the fifth wheel 4. This plug wedge 20,, because of its shape being complementary to the entry opening, is fixed in the fifth wheel 4, so that no substantial relative motion can occur between plug wedge 20 and fifth wheel 4. In a side wall of the plug wedge 20 lying against the fifth wheel 4 there is a stationary plug 10, in which a laterally movable jack connection 6 has been inserted, thus producing a connection. The supply circuit 7 of the semi-trailer 3 is hooked up to the plug 10 via semi-trailer lines 21 led out from the plug wedge 20 at the back side. The semi-trailer lines 21 are dimensioned such as to allow the semi-trailer 3 to swing out relative to the tractor 2 when negotiating a curve.<br>
For the supplying of the semi-trailer 3, corresponding subassemblies are provided on<br>
the tractor 2, which bring electric power or compressed air in familiar fashion via several vehicle lines, of which one line 18 is shown as an example, to a shared console 17 on the back side 15 (see Fig. 3) of the driver's,cabin 16. Several supply lines 1 are connected to the shared console 17, of which one supply line 1 is shown.<br>
In the depicted situation of Fig. 1, in which both the tractor 2 and the semi-trailer 3 are outfitted for operation with an automated line coupling system 5, the supply line 1 is connected by its plug-in element 9, mounted at its end, to a second supply console 11. The second supply console 11 engages with a feed line 14, arranged permanently on the tractor 2, by which the required electric power or compressed air is conducted up to the jack connection 6.<br>
Another situation is illustrated by Figure 2. Here, the tractor 2 has the components of the automated line coupling system 5, not otherwise designated. The semi-trailer 3, however, is conventionally outfitted and must be connected to the tractor 2 by supply lines 1 connected by hand. For this, the plug-in element 9 is loosened from the second supply console 11 located on the tractor 2 and instead the supply line 1 is connected by the plug-in element 9 directly to a first supply console 8 of the semi-trailer 3. In this connection of the semi-trailer 3, the second supply console 11 and the feed line 14 do not carry electric power, control signals, or compressed air. Even though the benefits of an automatic line coupling system 5 cannot be fully utilized in this situation, it is still possible to hook up the semi-trailer 3 to the tractor 2 in conventional fashion and haul it.<br>
Figure 3 shows a modified semi-trailer 3, which can be operated especially easily on tractors 2 with or without components of an automated line coupling system 5. In Figure 3, both the tractor 2 and the semi-trailer 3 are outfitted with an automated line coupling system 5, for example.<br>
Therefore, the supplying of the semi-trailer 3 occurs via the supply line 1 hooked up to the second supply console 11, the feed line 14, the automated line coupling system 5 and the semi-trailer lines 21 (see enlarged cutout in Fig. 1), which pass into a second line branch 13b. The second line branch 13b empties into a distributor 12, which is integrated into the supply circuit 7. Furthermore, the distributor 12 is connected to a first line branch 13a, which runs to the front end of the semi-trailer 3 and ends at the first supply console 8. This first line branch 13a is dead when the semi-trailer 3 is supplied via the automated line coupling system 5, but it is needed in order to possibly connect the semi-trailer 3 via the first supply console 8 to a tractor 2 without an automated line coupling system.<br><br>
