Description.<br>
Electric motor having a coaxially arranged pump<br>
The invention relates to an electric motor having a<br>
coaxially arranged pump for a coolant circuit, in<br>
particular in a system with temperature transfer and/or<br>
heat transfer, within housing parts, which are<br>
configured as a hermetically sealed pressure enclosure,<br>
a shaft assembly transmits a torque from the electric<br>
motor to at least one impeller, which is arranged in<br>
the pump housing, and a flywheel is arranged between<br>
the electric motor and the pump housing, all the<br>
rotating parts are arranged within a hermetically<br>
sealed motor/pump assembly, and the motor/pump assembly<br>
is filled with fluid.<br>
In power station systems equipped with heat generators<br>
and having temperature transfer and/or heat transfer<br>
devices, it is known to use motor/pump assemblies,<br>
which are equipped with a flywheel. This is a safety<br>
measure in order to be able to guarantee that, in the<br>
event of a possible fault, a coolant circulation is<br>
maintained through the pump for a minimum time due to<br>
the inertia of a flywheel. Due to the moment of inertia<br>
of a flywheel, such an electric motor continues to run<br>
even when the power has failed, and in doing so the<br>
motor/pump assembly pumps a quantity of coolant.<br>
Although reduced, such a quantity of coolant is<br>
sufficient to guarantee a dissipation of heat in a heat<br>
transfer device until the heat generator has been<br>
safely switched off.<br>
A so-called dry electric motor has been disclosed as a<br><br>
result of US-A 3 960 034 in which the motor and the<br>
flywheel are cooled with air. Here, the flywheel is<br>
additionally equipped with a protective device in order<br>
to prevent possible damage to the environment due to a<br>
disintegrating flywheel in the event of overspeeds.<br>
However, in the case of motor/pump assemblies without<br>
shaft seals, disclosed by DE-C 2 807 876 or US-A 4 084<br>
87 6, there is a hydrodynamic friction resistance due to<br>
the motor filled with coolant and due to a flywheel<br>
rotating in the coolant. The rotation of the flywheel<br>
in the coolant, frequently water, causes a high power<br>
loss due to the hydrodynamic friction and the<br>
generation of heat energy. This reduces the overall<br>
efficiency of pump, motor and flywheel. This motor/pump<br>
assembly has a thermal barrier with a thin housing neck<br>
between the pump section and the motor section in order<br>
to keep the heat conduction between the hot pump<br>
housing and the cooled motor housing as low as<br>
possible. A flywheel driven by the shaft assembly is<br>
located behind the thermal barrier on the face of the<br>
motor housing and within a pressure-tight common<br>
housing. Furthermore, to reduce the hydrodynamic<br>
friction losses, the flywheel is surrounded by a<br>
sleeve, which is rotatably mounted in the housing and<br>
has inlet openings for the fluid in the motor housing.<br>
In operation, the sleeve assumes an average speed,<br>
which is less than the speed of the flywheel, due to<br>
the hydrodynamic friction surfaces between housing,<br>
sleeve and flywheel. This is intended to give rise to a<br>
reduction in the friction losses at the flywheel, which<br>
is arranged in the cooler motor section.<br>
An electric motor in the form of a canned motor for a<br>
motor/pump assembly with a flywheel is disclosed by EP<br>
0 351 488 B1 or US-A 4 886 430. The flywheel is<br>
designed as a bearing element within the housing part,<br>
which forms a pressure enclosure, in the area of a<br><br>
pressure-side pump housing cover of the encapsulated<br>
and fluid-filled motor/pump assembly. It undertakes the<br>
radial bearing function for the shaft assembly in the<br>
area of the pump housing. Furthermore as the flywheel<br>
is also designed as an axial bearing, in contrast to<br>
the solution according to DE-C 2 807 876, this has<br>
enabled an axial bearing arrangement at the end of the<br>
motor remote from the pump to be dispensed with.<br>
A pot-shaped insert is arranged in the housing between<br>
the pump housing and the flywheel absorbing the bearing<br>
forces as an integral thermal barrier. It is provided<br>
with insulating air chambers on the outside and<br>
opposite the pump section. An additional external fluid<br>
cooling is arranged on its inside facing the flywheel<br>
face. A further wall element absorbing the bearing<br>
forces is arranged between the fluid cooling and the<br>
face of the flywheel near the pump. Due to the design<br>
of the canned motor/pump assembly, the flywheel chamber<br>
and the rotor chamber of the electric motor are filled<br>
with the pumping fluid to be pumped, and these chambers<br>
are at the same pressure as the pump housing, while the<br>
stator chamber of the motor is designed to be dry. The<br>
motor is enclosed by a heat exchanger, through which<br>
the same water flows that lubricates and cools the<br>
bearing elements abutting the flywheel. This cooling<br>
circulation from the motor, radial and axial bearing as<br>
well as the flywheel also flows through the flywheel<br>
itself. This therefore weakens the hub/shaft bonding of<br>
the flywheel.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of achieving an<br>
improved solution for motor/pump assemblies equipped<br>
with a flywheel, in which the design of a flywheel, its<br>
operational safety and also its power loss as a result<br>
of hydrodynamic friction are improved.<br>
The solution to this problem provides that the flywheel<br><br>
comprises a flywheel body having a multiplicity of<br>
cavities and having heavy-metal inserts, which are<br>
arranged in the cavities, that a heavy metal having a<br>
density of greater than 11.0 (kg/dm3) forms the heavy-<br>
metal inserts or is arranged therein, and that the<br>
flywheel body is composed of a high-strength material.<br>
This solution offers the advantage of easier and better<br>
adaptability to different operating situations. By<br>
simple selection and arrangement of the cavities,<br>
different heavy-metal inserts can be inserted therein.<br>
For those applications in which the pumping fluid in<br>
the motor/pump assembly can undergo unfavorable<br>
reactions with the heavy-metal inserts, means are<br>
provided for shielding the heavy-metal inserts against<br>
a surrounding fluid. These means can be arranged on the<br>
flywheel body. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
inserts are provided with means for separating the<br>
heavy-metal inserts from a surrounding fluid.<br>
It has been shown to be particularly advantageous when<br>
the heavy-metal inserts are designed in the form of a<br>
cartridge and fixed in the flywheel body by means,<br>
which are known in themselves. In this respect, the<br>
inserts can be safely manufactured at an alternative<br>
place and are therefore easy to transport and can also<br>
be stored. Later, when the machining of a flywheel body<br>
is complete, they can be inserted into said flywheel in<br>
the simplest manner. The retention of the heavy-metal<br>
inserts in the flywheel body can be carried out using<br>
technical means, which are known in themselves. These<br>
would be welded joints, screwed joints, soldering,<br>
gluing, shrink or press joints and the like. The type<br>
of joint is chosen depending on the particular<br>
operating conditions.<br>
It is also possible to design the heavy-metal inserts<br>
in the form of filler material placed in the cavities<br><br>
and to retain them there using means, which are known<br>
in themselves. This would be a solution for those cases<br>
in which the heavy metal is stocked as a pourable,<br>
granular material or similar and is to be handled<br>
accordingly.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, it<br>
has been shown to be advantageous when the flywheel<br>
body does not have a hole for feeding through the shaft<br>
assembly. With electric motors having very high drive<br>
powers, such as are used in large power stations, very<br>
large forces act on such a flywheel. Here, there is a<br>
risk that unfavorable hub stresses occur in the area of<br>
the transition between flywheel body and shaft assembly<br>
starting from a through-hole for a shaft assembly. In<br>
the extreme case, for example in overload operation,<br>
this can lead to the flywheel body breaking. On the<br>
other hand, it is more advantageous to join the<br>
flywheel body to the shaft assembly by means of single<br>
or multi-part flange joints. This considerably reduces<br>
the risk of the flywheel body breaking. The spur gears,<br>
which serve to transfer the torque and which form the<br>
joining means between flywheel body and shaft assembly,<br>
are also advantageous.<br>
As the electric motor and the hermetically sealed<br>
motor/pump assembly driven thereby are filled with<br>
pumping fluid, there is the additional problem here<br>
that a flywheel rotating in the fluid also generates a<br>
high power loss due to the fluid friction. For economic<br>
or safety reasons it can nevertheless be expedient to<br>
deliberately leave such a power loss in the area of the<br>
flywheel in order to achieve the hermetic sealing and<br>
to be able to dispense with the use of shaft seals,<br>
which are prone to failure.<br>
For this purpose, it is provided that at least one heat<br>
exchanger surrounding the outside diameter of the<br><br>
flywheel is arranged within the pressure enclosure and<br>
forms a radial wall surface of a flywheel chamber, that<br>
a high-pressure zone of the pump chamber is connected<br>
by means of one or more flow paths fed over the outside<br>
of the heat exchanger to a side of the flywheel chamber<br>
remote from the pump, that a ring gap between heat<br>
exchanger and flywheel forms a first return flow path<br>
between the flywheel chamber remote from the pump and<br>
the flywheel chamber near the pump, and that a second<br>
return flow path arranged in the area of the shaft<br>
assembly connects the flywheel chamber near the pump to<br>
the pump chamber.<br>
With this solution, a defined high but nevertheless<br>
operationally safe temperature is guaranteed in the<br>
flywheel chamber. Here, the knowledge is based on the<br>
fact that at higher fluid temperatures within the<br>
flywheel chamber the power losses occurring here are<br>
greatly reduced, as the density of the fluid and its<br>
viscosity are reduced as a result of the effect of<br>
temperature, and therefore the friction losses are<br>
minimized. The arrangement of the heat exchanger on the<br>
larger diameter around the flywheel results in a<br>
particularly efficient cooling action. An improved<br>
cooling action occurs when a pumping fluid taken from<br>
the pump chamber flows away via the largest diameter of<br>
the heat exchanger and enters the flywheel chamber on<br>
the side remote from the pump.<br>
The pumping fluid will flow back into the pump chamber<br>
via the flow and return flow paths as a result of the<br>
pressure gradient in the pump housing between a low<br>
pressure at the impeller inlet and a high pressure<br>
after the impeller, after a guide device or in a spiral<br>
chamber. As there are no holes in the flywheel, the<br>
cooled pumping fluid will flow back in the opposite<br>
direction through the gap between the outside diameter<br>
of the flywheel and the inside diameter of the<br><br>
cylindrical heat exchanger. In doing so, it will<br>
additionally and for a second time be subjected to the<br>
cooling action of the heat exchanger and at the same<br>
time absorbs the lost heat of the flywheel. The pumping<br>
fluid leaves the flywheel chamber on the smaller<br>
diameter in the area of the shaft assembly and at its<br>
other side near the pump. It flows back into the main<br>
pump stream through relief holes arranged in the<br>
impeller. The pressure difference between the removal<br>
opening and the inlet opening in the pump housing can<br>
be sufficient for driving this internal fluid flow.<br>
The cooling action can be improved in that several heat<br>
exchangers surround the flywheel coaxially on the<br>
larger diameter, and between these heat exchangers a<br>
ring gap or several channels form the flow path to the<br>
flywheel chamber remote from the pump. The heat<br>
exchanger(s) is/are connected to an external cooling<br>
water source and can be designed in the form of a<br>
cylinder, for example.<br>
In addition, a further embodiment of the invention<br>
provides that at least one pumping device driven by the<br>
shaft assembly is arranged in the second return flow<br>
path. This makes it possible to increase the flow rate<br>
of the cooling liquid flow. These can be known means in<br>
the form of a small additional impeller, which is<br>
provided with holes or blades, a fluid circulation<br>
screw or other known devices.<br>
According to other embodiments, a motor cover on the<br>
pump side forms the wall of the flywheel chamber remote<br>
from the pump, and a cooling device is arranged in the<br>
motor cover. This cooling device can be designed as a<br>
low-pressure cooling device or as a high-pressure<br>
cooling device. It is also possible to design this<br>
cooling device as part of a high-pressure motor cooling<br>
system. In order to reduce mixing, a shaft seal is<br><br>
arranged between motor chamber and flywheel in the area<br>
of the shaft assembly. This can be designed as a<br>
restrictor section, labyrinth seal or similar.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown in<br>
the drawings and is described in more detail below. In<br>
the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section through a<br>
motor/pump assembly,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a flywheel<br>
body and heavy-metal inserts,<br>
Fig. 3 &amp; 4 show enlarged views of the flywheel<br>
chamber, and<br>
Fig. 5 shows a diagram of a temperature<br>
distribution at the flywheel.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a liquid-cooled motor 1 having a housing<br>
2, which is designed as a pressure enclosure. The<br>
inside of the motor 1 is filled with fluid, and a high-<br>
pressure cooling system 3 is connected to the ends of<br>
the motor in order to dissipate the electrical power<br>
loss. A radial and an axial bearing are arranged at the<br>
one end of the motor 4, the axial bearing at the same<br>
time serving as a pumping device for the cooling water<br>
circulating within the motor and through the cooler 3.<br>
The driving force of the motor acts on a shaft assembly<br>
5 and thus transmits a torque to a pump 6, which is<br>
coaxially arranged with respect to the electric motor<br>
1. An impeller 8 with downstream guide device 9 is<br>
arranged within a pump housing 7, and the pump housing<br>
7 is sealed by means of a cover element 10 and<br>
connected to the housing 2 of the motor 1 by means of<br>
tie rods 11. A flywheel 12, the moment of inertia of<br>
which ensures a further rotational movement of the<br><br>
shaft assembly 5 with the connected impeller 8 and<br>
therefore a pumping capacity of the pump 6 in the event<br>
of a power failure, is located within the cover element<br>
10, which is here designed in several parts.<br>
Those housing parts 2, 4, 7, 10 of pump and motor,<br>
which define an inner chamber with respect to a<br>
surrounding atmosphere, form a so-called pressure<br>
enclosure. This is designed for a very high system<br>
pressure, which prevails in a heat transfer system, in<br>
which this motor/pump assembly is installed for<br>
circulating a pumping fluid. As such an assembly is<br>
designed for drive powers greater than 600 kW and<br>
therefore has a disproportionate size, the<br>
representation in Fig. 1 is only of a schematic type.<br>
Details are shown in the following Figures 2 and 3 in<br>
an enlarged view.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a view of a flywheel 12 in perspective. It<br>
consists of a flywheel body 13, which is shown in light<br>
gray in Figure 2. The flywheel body 13 also has a<br>
multiplicity of cavities 14, 15 shown in dark gray.<br>
These cavities 14, 15 serve to accommodate heavy-metal<br>
inserts 16, 17 with which the moment of inertia of a<br>
fully assembled flywheel 12 is increased. The cavities<br>
14,	15 have different diameters, as a result of which<br>
it is guaranteed that the flywheel body 13, which is<br>
made of a high-strength material, is resistant to the<br>
centrifugal forces prevailing during an operation. Due<br>
to the arrangement, size and number of the cavities 14,<br>
15,	a safe stress characteristic is guaranteed in the<br>
flywheel body 13 under the effect of high temperatures.<br>
An adequate reserve of strength is therefore ensured<br>
even under critical operating conditions, for example<br>
in the event of turbine operation caused by an<br>
operational fault or overload operation of the pump, as<br>
a result of which the speed is higher than the rated<br>
speed.<br><br>
A flange joint 19, with which the connection to the<br>
shaft assembly 5 is made, is fixed to the face 18 of<br>
the cylindrical flywheel body 13. The spur gear 20<br>
shown here acts together with an appropriate design of<br>
the shaft assembly 5 to thus guarantee a reliable<br>
transmission of torque. Other frictional and/or<br>
interlocking forms of connection can also be used. In<br>
doing so, however, it should be ensured that these<br>
types of connection do not have a negative effect on<br>
the stress characteristic within the flywheel body 13.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that<br>
correspondingly sized heavy-metal inserts 16, 17 are<br>
arranged in the different sized cavities 14, 15. Here,<br>
the heavy metal can be arranged as inserts in the form<br>
of rods or filler material. The heavy-metal inserts 16,<br>
17 shown here illustrate a variant in which the heavy<br>
metal is to be found within a cartridge 21, 22. Such a<br>
cartridge is simple to manufacture, easy to handle, to<br>
store and to transport, and thus fulfils the<br>
requirement for trouble-free stocking of such heavy-<br>
metal inserts 16, 17. In addition, such a cartridge 21,<br>
22 protects a heavy metal arranged therein against the<br>
effect of the fluid, which surrounds a flywheel 12 for<br>
cooling purposes, or vice versa.<br>
The sealing of such a cartridge, which in this case is<br>
designed in the form of a cylinder, is carried out by<br>
means of known techniques, and is possible on normal<br>
machine tools. Special machines are not required for<br>
this. Such a cartridge 21, 22 can be retained within<br>
the flywheel body 13 with the known techniques. It is<br>
also possible to design the cavities 14, 15 in the<br>
flywheel body 13 as through-holes or blind holes and to<br>
arrange a heavy metal directly therein. In order to<br>
secure the position of a heavy metal, which is located<br>
directly in the cavities 14, 15, the cavities can be<br><br>
sealed by means of individual cover elements or by one<br>
large cover element, the size of which corresponds to<br>
the diameter of the flywheel.<br>
Fig. 3 and 4 show an enlarged view of the arrangement<br>
of the flywheel in the shaft assembly and its position<br>
between pump and motor. The impeller 8 with a<br>
downstream guide device 9 can be seen within the pump<br>
housing 6. A single or multi-stage design can be used<br>
depending on the type of pump. In the single or last<br>
pump stage shown here, a removal pipe can be seen in a<br>
zone with the highest pressure within the pump housing<br>
7 - here after the guide device 9. This is used as flow<br>
path 23 for a pumping fluid and guides this within the<br>
pressure enclosure into the flywheel chamber 24. A pump<br>
cover 10 and a motor cover 25 near the pump form the<br>
flywheel chamber 24. The pressure and fluid-tight<br>
contact surface 26 of the two cover parts 10, 2 5 lies<br>
in the area of a face 18 of the flywheel 12 remote from<br>
the pump. The two-part flywheel housing so formed makes<br>
manufacture and assembly easier. All parts are held<br>
together by tie rods 11, which are screwed into the<br>
pump housing 7 and find their counter support in a<br>
flange of the motor housing 2.<br>
A heat exchanger 27, which surrounds the flywheel 12<br>
and which is connected to a low-pressure cooling system<br>
A-B which penetrates the pressure enclosure, is<br>
arranged within the flywheel chamber 24. The flow path<br>
23 connecting the pump inner chamber to the flywheel<br>
chamber 24 carries a pumping fluid over the outside 28<br>
of the heat exchanger 27 to the side of the flywheel<br>
chamber 24 remote from the pump. A further low-pressure<br>
cooling system C-D is arranged at the face of the<br>
flywheel chamber 24 remote from the pump in the area of<br>
the motor cover 25, with the help of which an<br>
appropriate temperature gradient is achieved in the<br>
area of the face 18 of the flywheel remote from the<br><br>
pump. Furthermore, it can be seen that the motor cover<br>
25 has a connector for a high-pressure motor cooling<br>
system E, which is connected to the motor cooler 3. The<br>
arrows show the direction of flow of the motor cooling<br>
fluid around the stator end windings. At the same time,<br>
they serve as lubricating fluid for the motor bearing<br>
3 0 near the pump. The heated motor cooling fluid is<br>
removed via channels 31 in the motor cover 25 and<br>
cooled down by means of the motor cooler 3 shown in<br>
Fig. 1 and fed into the motor 1 once more at the motor<br>
cover 4 remote from the pump.<br>
Pumping fluid entering the flywheel chamber 24 at its<br>
end remote from the pump flows through a ring gap 32<br>
between the inside 33 of the heat exchanger 27 and the<br>
outside diameter of the flywheel 12 to the flywheel<br>
chamber 24.1 near the pump. This ring gap 32 forms a<br>
first return flow path for the pumping fluid, which is<br>
simultaneously subjected here to the effect of the heat<br>
exchanger 27. It flows via the flywheel chamber 24.1<br>
near the pump to the face 34 of the flywheel 12 near<br>
the pump towards the shaft assembly 5. From the area of<br>
the shaft assembly 5, it flows back via the second<br>
return flow path arranged there to the impeller 8 of<br>
the pump 6. In doing so, a pump bearing 35 is<br>
lubricated at the same time. The direction of flow is<br>
determined by the pressure gradient between the high-<br>
pressure zone in the pump housing 7 and the lower-<br>
pressure zone in the area of the impeller 8, which is<br>
defined by the axial thrust relief openings 36.<br>
When designing such a motor/pump assembly, the size and<br>
number of flow paths is determined for the specified<br>
operating conditions in order to achieve a basic<br>
setting for the cooling pumping fluid for the<br>
appropriate powers. It is also possible to provide an<br>
additional pumping device 37 in the area of the second<br>
flow path, which is driven by the shaft assembly 5. In<br><br>
this exemplary embodiment, a fluid circulation screw is<br>
shown, but it could equally well be an appropriate<br>
impeller or other known auxiliary pumping device 37.<br>
This can improve the cooling performance of the pumping<br>
fluid circulating in the flywheel chamber 24, 24.1. The<br>
lost heat produced by the flywheel 12 due to the<br>
hydrodynamic friction in the fluid is thus dissipated<br>
in an extremely effective manner by mass transport.<br>
Due to the specific guidance of the internal cooling<br>
flow from the pump chamber to the flywheel chamber 24,<br>
24.1, the temperature level in the flywheel chamber and<br>
also within the flywheel 12 can be influenced such that<br>
a homogenous temperature level develops during<br>
operation. The development of the homogenous<br>
temperature level in the flywheel 12 is assisted by the<br>
heat exchanger performance at the outer circumference<br>
of the flywheel 12 and the cooling action at the face<br>
18 of the flywheel remote from the pump. Controlling<br>
this heat exchanger performance enables the homogeneity<br>
of the temperature level to be maintained. This has the<br>
decisive advantage that material stresses caused by<br>
temperature differences are prevented within the<br>
flywheel 12.<br>
With this solution, heat can even be fed back into the<br>
pump circuit for that operating condition in which the<br>
temperature level in the flywheel chamber is higher<br>
than the temperature level of the pumping fluid. By<br>
this means, it is possible to partially recover the<br>
lost heat. In any case, however, the temperature in the<br>
flywheel chamber 24, 24.1 is limited to a maximum,<br>
which does not have a negative effect on the strength<br>
of the flywheel body.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a variant of Fig. 3 in which only the<br>
lower-pressure cooling system C-D in the area of the<br>
face 8 of the flywheel 12 remote from the pump has been<br><br>
dispensed with. Instead of this, the high-pressure<br>
motor cooling system E is used simultaneously to also<br>
affect the temperature level in the flywheel chamber<br>
24. Depending on the specified operating conditions of<br>
such a motor/pump assembly, the necessary homogenous<br>
temperature level in the flywheel 12 is also ensured<br>
with this solution. The wall 29 of the flywheel chamber<br>
24 remote from the pump, formed by the pump-side motor<br>
cover 25, is here subjected to the high-pressure motor<br>
cooling system E with the help of a connection 39. A<br>
shaft seal 38, which reduces mixing of the fluids, is<br>
arranged in the area of the wall 25.<br>
A first locus σA, which shows a determining strength<br>
characteristic of the material of the flywheel body as<br>
a function of temperature, is illustrated in the<br>
diagram of Fig. 5. This strength characteristic, for<br>
example 80% of the elastic limit, includes an adequate<br>
safety margin with respect to material failure.<br>
The overall efficiency of the motor/pump assembly is<br>
plotted against temperature in a second locus nges. The<br>
temperature corresponds to that, which can prevail in<br>
the flywheel chamber. The point of intersection A of<br>
the two loci corresponds to the operating point of the<br>
motor/pump assembly with all cooling systems operating.<br>
The optimum operating temperature Topt prevails at this<br>
point A. Here, a homogenous temperature level Topt is<br>
established in the flywheel chamber and in the<br>
flywheel.<br>
In addition, this operating point A has a further high<br>
safety margin S compared with those operating<br>
conditions in which a failure of an external cooling<br>
system was expected. If such a condition occurs in<br>
which one or more external cooling systems fail, which<br>
constitutes a fault situation, then because of the<br>
internal fluid friction within the flywheel chamber the<br><br>
temperature will rise and establish itself at a maximum<br>
temperature T0.<br>
The consequence of such a temperature rise is that the<br>
viscosity of the pumping fluid reduces as a result of<br>
the increasing temperature, and therefore the power<br>
loss in the flywheel chamber decreases. As a result of<br>
this, the overall efficiency nges of the motor/pump<br>
assembly increases. The negative effect of a<br>
temperature rise, however, is a reduction in the<br>
material strength of the flywheel body to a lower value<br>
aL at the temperature T0. This gives rise to a fault<br>
situation operating point B in the flywheel chamber at<br>
the higher temperature level T0 in the event of a<br>
failure of an external cooling. The strength of the<br>
flywheel body is still guaranteed at this operating<br>
point B, however, due to the remaining 20% elastic<br>
limit reserve in this example. The shaded area C on the<br>
right in the diagram adjacent to the fault situation<br>
operating point B denotes an inadmissible operating<br>
range.<br>
As a result of deliberately forgoing an improvement in<br>
the overall efficiency nes, a significant improvement<br>
in the operational safety is achieved. Safe operation<br>
of the motor/pump assembly is still guaranteed even in<br>
the event of a failure of an external cooling device.<br>
Even then, there is no fear that the flywheel will fail<br>
due to inadmissible stress conditions in the material<br>
of the flywheel body. Consequently, this enables<br>
elaborate protection devices for the flywheel to be<br>
dispensed with, which leads to a significant cost<br>
reduction and an increase in the operational safety of<br>
such a motor/pump assembly.<br><br>
