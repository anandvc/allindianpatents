				<td>INDUCTION HEATING OR MELTING POWER SUPPLY UTILIZING A TUNING CAPACITOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an ac power supply for use in induction heating or     melting applications wherein the induction power circuit is resonantly tuned.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional power supply 110 that is used in induction heating or melting applications. The power supply consists of an ac-to-dc rectifier and filter section 112, a dc-to-ac inverter section 120 and a tuning capacitor section 130. For<br>
     the power supply shown in FIG. 1, a three-phase diode bridge rectifier 114 converts three-phase (A, B, C) ac utility line power into dc power. Current limiting reactor LIOS smoothes out the ripple in the output dc current of the rectifier, and capacitor CMS filters the ac component from the output dc voltage of the rectifier. The filtered dc output of the rectifier is inverted to ac by a full-bridge inverter consisting of solid state switches Sioi,<br>
IS     8102, 8103 and SIM and associated antiparallel diodes DXOI, Dm, DIOS and DIM,<br>
respectively. Alternating turn-on/turn-off cycles of switch pairs 8101/8103 and 8102/8104 produce a synthesized ac inverter output at terminals 3 and 4.<br>
[0003] Induction load coil LIOI represents the power coil used in the induction heating or melting application. For example, in an induction furnace, load coil LIOI, is wound<br>
     around the exterior of a crucible in which metal charge has been placed. In an induction heating application, a metal workpiece, such as a strip or wire, may travel through a helical winding of load coil LIOI or otherwise be brought near to the coil to inductively heat the workpiece. Current supplied by the power supply and flowing through load coil LIOI creates a magnetic field that either directly heats the metal charge or workpiece by<br>
     magnetic induction, or heats the workpiece by heat conduction from a susceptor that is heated by magnetic induction. Load coil LIOI, whether it be a single coil or an assembly of interconnected coil sections, has a very low operating power factor. Because of this, a tuning capacitor (or bank of capacitors), such as capacitor Cioi must be provided in the load coil circuit to improve the overall power factor of the load coil circuit. These tuning<br>
 <br>
capacitors are a significant cost and volume component of the power supply. Therefore, there exists the need for a power supply for inductive heating or melting applications that utilizes smaller and less costly tuning capacitors.<br>
[0004] An objective of the present invention is to provide a power supply for inductive 5     heating or melting applications that utilizes a capacitor connected between the output of the rectifier and the input of the inverter to form a resonantly tuned circuit with the induction load coil used in the application.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
[0005] In one aspect, the present invention is apparatus for, and a method of, providing a 10     power supply with rectifier and inverter sections for use with an induction load coil wherein a tuning capacitor is provided across the output of the rectifier and the input of the inverter to form a resonant circuit with the induction load coil. The induction load coil may comprise an active load coil connected to the output of the inverter, and a passive load coil connected in parallel with a capacitor to form a tank circuit Other 15     aspects of the invention are set forth in this specification and the appended claims.<br>

     Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0025] Referring to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, there is shown in FIG. 2 an illustration of one example of power supply 10 of the present invention for use in induction heating or melting applications. Ac-to-dc rectifier and filter section 12 includes an ac-to-dc rectifier. A multi-phase rectifier, in this non-limiting 10     example of the invention, a three-phase diode bridge rectifier 14 is used to convert three-phase (A, B, C) ac utility line power into dc power. Optional current limiting reactor Lg smoothes out the ripple from the output dc current of the rectifier. Section 16 of the power supply diagrammatically illustrates coil tuning capacitor Ci, which can be a single capacitor or a bank of interconnected capacitors that form a capacitive element.<br>
t<br>
     [0026] In FIG. 2, the dc output of the rectifier is supplied to input terminals 1 and 2 of a full-bridge inverter in inverter section 20. The inverter consists of solid state switches Si, 82, 83 and 84 and associated antiparallel diodes DI, Dz, Da and D4, respectively. Alternating turn-on/tum-off cycles of switch pairs 81/83 and 82/84 produce a synthesized ac inverter output at terminals 3 and 4. A preferred, but not limiting, choice of<br>
     component for the solid state switch is an isolated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), which exhibits the.desirable characteristics of power bipolar transistors and power MOS-FETs at high operating voltages and currents. In one example of the invention, the inverter employs a phase-shifting scheme (pulse width control) relative to the turn-on/turn-off cycles of the two switch pairs whereby variable overlapping on-times for the two switch<br>
     pairs is used to vary the effective RMS output voltage of the inverter.<br>
[0027] Induction load coil Lg represents the power coil used in the induction heating or melting apparatus. The capacitance of capacitor Ci is selected to form a resonant circuit with the impedance of load coil Lp at the operating frequency of the inverter, which is the switching rate of the switch pairs used in the inverter. Consequently, a tuning capacitor is<br>
 <br>
not required at the output of the inverter. Selection of available circuit components may not allow operation exactly at resonance, but as close to resonance as is achievable with available components. The ac current flowing through induction load coil L9 from the output of the inverter magnetically couples with an electrically conductive material, which 5     may be, for example, a conductive metal or a susceptor.<br>
[0028] FIG. 3 through FIG. 5 illustrate the performance characteristics for power supply 10 of the present invention as shown in FIG. 2 with input utility line power (A, B, C) of 480 volts line-tb-line, 60 Hertz, and inverter 20 operating at an output frequency of 60 Hz. For this particular non-limiting example: LS is selected as 5,000 pH (for an impedance of<br>
    3.77 ohms at the rectifier ripple output frequency of 120 Hz); Ci is selected as 5,000 /iF (for an impedance of 0.27 ohms at the rectifier ripple output frequency of 120 Hz); and LS is selected as 1,000 juH (for an impedance of 0.38 ohms at the inverter output frequency of 60 Hz). Not shown in FIG. 2, but used in this sample analysis is a resistance of 0.16 ohms for induction load coil L?. Operating the CifLg circuit at resonance for the output<br>
     frequency of inverter 20 results in a substantially sinusoidal inverter output voltage, Vout. and output current, Iout (at terminals 3 and 4), as graphically illustrated in FIG. 3. FIG. 4 graphically illustrates that the voltage across capacitor Ci, namely Vci, is driven to its limiting lower value of zero volts as a result of capacitor Ci being in resonance with coil 1,9 at the ripple frequency of 120 Hz. Vci is the applied voltage to the input of inverter 20<br>
    (at terminals 1 and 2). FIG. 4 also illustrates the ripple current, ILg, through reactor Lg. The impedance of reactor Lg is generally selected to be much greater than the impedance of Ci to block feedback of harmonics from the inverter circuit to the rectifier's power source. FIG. 5 graphically illustrates the voltage, Vs, across one of the solid state switches in inverter 20, and the current, Is, through one of the switches at maximum<br>
     power output when there is zero overlap angle between Vs and Is. Switching device turn-off at zero volts for Vs when dc ripple has reached zero (e.g., at 240.0 milliseconds (ms) in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5), will minimize switching loses. Additionally, since switching commutation occurs at zero voltage in this example, any spikes due to stray circuit inductance will be significantly less than in a conventional inverter having low ac ripple<br>
     current in the dc link voltage. This specific example is provided to illustrate the practice of the invention, which is not limited to the specific elements and values used in this example.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0029] FIG. 6 illustrates a second example of the present invention. In this example, the load coil consists of an active coil LI and at least one passive coil L^. Coils LI and L^ may be wound in one of various configurations, such as sequentially or overlapped, to accomplish mutual magnetic coupling of the coils as further described below. Coil LI is 5     connected to the output of inverter 20. Coil l^ is connected in parallel with resonant tuning capacitor Ca to form a parallel tank resonant circuit. Coil L^ is not physically connected to coil LI. The parallel tank resonant circuit is energized by magnetically coupling coil Ls with the magnetic field generated in coil LI when current supplied from the output of inverter 20 flows through coil Lj.<br>
     [0030] The benefit of separate active and passive coils can be further appreciated by the vector diagram shown in FIG. 7. In the figure, with respect to the active coil circuit, vector OV represents current Ii in active coil LI as illustrated FIG. 6. Vector OA represents the resistive component of the active coil's voltage, IiRi (Hi not shown in the figures). Vector AB represents the inductive component of the active coil's voltage,<br>
     coLiIi (where co equals the product of 2n and f, the operating frequency of the power supply). Vector BC represents the voltage, wMk, induced by the passive coil Lj onto active coil LI. The half-wave ripple voltage Vci across capacitor Ci and the switching function of the two switch pairs 81/83 and 82/84 produce the effect of a pseudo capacitor Ci1 connected in series with LI that would result in a sinusoidal voltage at terminals 5 and<br>
     6 in FIG. 6. Vector CD represents the voltage, Ii/coCi', that would appear across this<br>
pseudo series capacitor Ci1. Vector OD represents the output voltage, VinT, of the inverter (terminals 3 and 4 in FIG. 6).<br>
[0031] With respect to the passive coil circuit, vector OW represents current It in passive coil L2 that is induced by the magnetic field produced by current Ii. Vector OF represents 25     the resistive component of the passive coil's voltage, ^2 (Rz not shown in the figures). Vector FE represents the inductive component of the active coil's voltage, oLJb-Vector EG represents the voltage, oMIi, induced by the active coil LI onto passive coil Ii2. Vector GO represents the voltage, l2/oC2, on capacitor €2, which is connected across passive coil Lj.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 [0032] The active coil circuit is driven by the voltage source, Vjnv, which is the output of inverter 20, while the passive coil loop is not connected to an active energy source. Since the active and passive coils are mutually coupled, vector BC is added to vector OB, V'LOAD, which represents the voltage across an active induction load coil in the absence of 5     a passive capacitive load coil circuit, to result in vector OC, VLOAD, which is the voltage across an active load coil with a passive capacitive load coil circuit of the present invention. The resultant load voltage, VLOAD, has a smaller lagging power factor angle, <p angle between the x-axis and vector oc than conventional load coil as represented by ob. illustrated in fig. there is a power factor improvement of ap.></p>
[0033] In the present invention, the inductive impedance in the passive coil is substantially compensated for by the capacitive impedance (i.e., ooL/2 ~ l/ooCa). The uncompensated resistive component, R2, in the passive coil circuit is reflected into the active coil circuit by the mutual inductance between the two circuits, and the effective 15     active coil circuit's resistance is increased, thus improving the power factor angle, or efficiency of the coil system.<br>
[0034] Further the power factor angle, Y, for the output of the inverter improves by A*P as illustrated by the angle between vector OJ, V'inv (resultant vector of resistive component vector OA and capacitive component vector AJ in the absence of a passive 20     load coil circuit) and vector OD, Vinv (resultant vector of resistive component vector OH and capacitive component vector HD with a passive load coil circuit of the present invention).<br>
[0035] In other examples of the invention multiple active and/or passive coil circuits may be used to achieve a desired multiple coil arrangement for a particular application.<br>
     [0036] FIG. 8 illustrates another example of the power supply of the present invention. In this example autotransformer 80 is connected to the ac output of the inverter. The autotransformer has a first output terminal and a plurality (at least two) of second output terminals typically represented by autotransformer taps 100,110 and 120 in FIG. 8. The first terminal of induction load coil L? is connected to the autotransformer's first output<br>
    tenninal. The second terminal of the induction load coil is alternatively connected to one<br>
 <br>
of the plurality of the autotransformer's second output terminals. The circuit impedance of the autotransformer changes with the connected tap, which changes the load circuit impedance so that the power supply in FIG. 8 can selectively operate at approximate resonance at different output frequencies from the power supply. This is of advantage, for 5     example, when an electrically conductive material is being inductively heated. As known in the art inductively heating at different frequencies will change the depth of induced heat penetration of the material. When different depths of heating are required the tap on the autotransformer can be changed to achieve this result with the power supply operating at approximate resonant frequency.<br>
10     [0037] FIG. 9 illustrates one example of the physical arrangement for coil tuning capacitor Ci and inverter elements, namely solid state switches Si, 82, 83 and 84 and associated antiparallel diodes DI, DZ, DS and Di», respectively, for the power supply of the present invention. This arrangement is particularly favorable for minimizing stray inductance associated with connections to the coil tuning capacitor and dc connections to<br>
     the inverter elements. In this arrangement, coil tuning capacitor Ci is contained within enclosure 22 as further described below. In FIG. 9 one or more physical terminals 24 represent electrical terminal 60 of capacitor Ci as shown in FIG. 2; similarly one or more physical terminals 26 (best seen in FIG. ll(a)) represent electrical terminal 62 of capacitor Cj. Electrical insulators 25 may be provided for electrical isolation between the<br>
    electrical conductors and enclosure 22. Each solid state switch and its associated antiparallel diode may be physically provided as an integrally packaged switch/diode assembly 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 2. The four switch/diode assemblies are connected to form a full bridge inverter. First switch/diode assembly 28a and second switch/diode assembly 28b form a first pair of switch/diode assemblies that<br>
     both have a first terminal connected to the positive connection of coil tuning capacitor Ci; third switch/diode assembly 28c and fourth switch/diode assembly 28d form a second pair of switch/diode assemblies that both have a first terminal connected to the negative connection of coil tuning capacitor Ci. The first terminals of the first and second pairs of switch/diode assemblies form the dc input to the inverter. The second terminals of the<br>
     first and fourth switch/diode assemblies are connected to a first ac output (AC1) of the inverter; the second terminals of the second and third switch/diode assemblies are connected to a second ac output (AC2) of the inverter. In FIG. 9 physical electrical<br>
 <br>
<br>
conductor 30, represented by circuit terminal 1 in FIG. 2, connects positive capacitor physical terminals 24 (electrical terminal 60) to the terminals of switch/diode assemblies 28a and 28b that correspond to electrical terminals 1 in FIG. 2. Similarly physical electrical conductor 34, represented by circuit terminal 2 in FIG. 2, and connects negative 5     capacitor physical terminals 26 (electrical terminal 62) to the terminals of switch/diode assemblies 28c and 28d that correspond to electrical terminals 2 in FIG. 2. Physical electrical conductor 36 (via intermediate electrical conductors 36a and 36b joined together at electrically conductive connection 36c as shown in FIG. ll(a) in this non-limiting example of the invention) is represented by circuit terminal 3 in FIG. 2, and<br>
     connects terminals of switch/diode assemblies 28a and 28d {corresponding to first ac electrical terminal 3 in FIG. 2) to a first terminal of induction load coil L$ (not shown in FIG. 9). Similarly physical electrical conductor 38 (via intermediate electrical conductors 38a and 38b joined together at a suitable electrically conductive connection not shown in the figures, in this non-limiting example of the inverter) is represented by<br>
    circuit terminal 4 in FIG. 2, and connects terminals of switch/diode assemblies 28b and 28c (corresponding to second ac electrical terminal 4 in FIG. 2) to a second terminal of induction load coil 1,9 (not shown in FIG. 10). It is one object of the present invention to keep the inductance in the physical connections between the tuning capacitor and dc input to the inverter as low as possible. Therefore, conductors 30 and 34 are preferably formed<br>
     from a thin sheet material such as copper and sandwiched together with a thin layer of high dielectric strength material 33 (such as a MYLAR based dielectric) between them. Minimal thickness of the conductors and insulation keeps stray inductance to a minimum. It is also preferable to keep all dimensions of conductors 30 and 34 to the minimum required to make suitable connections.<br>
     [0038] Similarly it is desirable to maintain a low inductance circuit for the coil tuning capacitor Ci. In one non-limiting arrangement of the invention, coil tuning capacitor Ci comprises one or more wound film capacitors 60 shown in a typical arrangement in FIG. 12(a) and in partial cross section in FIG. 12(b). First capacitor conductor 61 is separated from adjacent second capacitor conductor 63 by dielectric layers 62 and 64.<br>
    First capacitor conductor 61 extends to the top of the rolled capacitor, while second capacitor conductor 63 extends to the bottom of the rolled capacitor. A first electrical conductor in contact with the top of the rolled capacitor will form the first terminal of the<br>
 <br>
capacitor and a second electrical conductor in contact with the bottom of the rolled capacitor will form the second electrical conductor.<br>
[0039] In the arrangement shown in FIG. 13(a) and FIG. 13(b), capacitors 60a and 60b are arranged on opposing sides of first and second capacitor connecting electrical 5     conductors 66 and 68, which are electrically separated by a dielectric 67. As with the conductors between the terminals of the coil tuning capacitor and the dc input to the inverter, in order to kept the inductance low, conductors 66 and 68 are preferably formed from a thin sheet material such as copper and sandwiched together with a thin layer of high dielectric strength material 67 (such as a MYLAR based dielectric) between them.<br>
     [0040] Capacitors 60a have their second (bottom) capacitor conductors 63 electrically in contact with first connecting electrical conductor 66. Capacitors 60b have their first (top) capacitor conductors 61 in contact with second connecting electrical conductor 68. Capacitors 60a have their first (top) capacitor conductors 61 electrically in contact with second connecting electrical conductor 68 by electrical conductor 70a, and capacitors 60b<br>
    have their second (bottom) capacitor conductors 63 electrically in contact with first<br>
connecting electrical conductor 66 by electrical conductor 70b. Electrical conductors 70a and 70b may be in the form of a copper rod passing through the center (spool) of each capacitor with an extending electrical conducting element at each end so that the first end of the copper rod makes contact with a capacitor's conductor that is not in contact with<br>
     either connecting electrical conductor 66 or 68, and the second end makes contact with either connecting electrical conductor 66 or 68. Electrical insulation 67 is provided around electrical conductors 70a and 70b so that they do not make electrical contact with a connecting electrical conductor that would short out a capacitor. The extending electrical conducting element may be in the form of »a copper plate 70c or a layer of<br>
     solder. Connecting electrical conductors 66 and 68 extend out of enclosure 22 to form first and second capacitor terminals 24 and 26.<br>
[0041] In the alternative arrangement shown in FIG. 14, capacitors 60c have their second (bottom) capacitor conductors 63 electrically connected to first connecting electrical conductor 66. The first (top) capacitor conductor 61 of each capacitor 60c is electrically 30     connected to second connecting electrical conductor 68 via electrical conductors 70a with suitable extending electrical conducting elements 70c.<br>
 <br>
<br>
to*<br>
[0042] In the alternative arrangement shown in FIG. 15, first connecting electrical conductor 66 may be press fitted around one or more capacitors 60d.
