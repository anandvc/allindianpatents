PRESSED, WAXY, SOLID CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
AND METHODS OF MAKING THEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a solid cleaning<br>
composition. The method can include pressing and/or vibrating flowable waxy<br>
particles of a waxy cleaning composition. For a waxy cleaning composition, pressing<br>
and/or vibrating flowable waxy particles determines the shape and density of the solid.<br>
The method can employ a concrete block machine and/or a turntable press for pressing<br>
and/or vibrating. The present invention also relates to a solid cleaning composition<br>
made by the method and to solid cleaning compositions including waxy particles bound<br>
together.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of solidification technology and solid block detergents in institutional<br>
and industrial operations was pioneered in the SOLID POWERÂ® brand technology<br>
claimed in Fernholz et al., U.S. Reissue Patent Nos. 32,762 and 32,818. Similar<br>
advances have not been achieved for waxy solid cleaning compositions.<br>
Conventional waxy solid compositions can be made by casting a melted<br>
composition and by extrusion. An expensive tablet press can apply its high pressures<br>
only to form tablet or puck sized solids. A tablet press is not suitable for making solid<br>
blocks. Casting requires melting the composition to form a liquid. Melting consumes<br>
energy and can destroy certain desirable ingredients in some cleaning products.<br>
Extruding requires expensive equipment and advanced technical know how.<br>
There remains a need for additional methods for making waxy solid cleaning<br>
compositions and for compositions that can be made by these methods.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a solid cleaning<br>
composition. The method can include pressing and/or vibrating flowable waxy<br>
particles of a waxy cleaning composition. For a waxy cleaning composition, pressing<br>
and/or vibrating flowable waxy particles determines the shape and density of the solid.<br>
The method can employ a concrete block machine for pressing and/or vibrating. The<br>
present invention also relates to a solid cleaning composition made by the method and<br>
to solid cleaning compositions including waxy particles bound together.<br>
The present method relates to a method of making a solid cleaning composition.<br>
This method includes providing flowable waxy particles comprising a waxy<br>
solidification agent, alkalinity source, sequestrant, or mixture thereof. The method can<br>
include mixing the desired ingredients to form the flowable waxy particles. The<br>
method also includes placing the flowable waxy particles into a form. The method can<br>
include gently pressing, vibrating, or a combination thereof, the flowable waxy particles<br>
in the form to produce the solid cleaning composition.<br>
Gently pressing, vibrating, or a combination thereof can be done by a concrete<br>
block machine, also known as a concrete products machine or masonry product<br>
machine, or by a turntable press. The method of making a solid cleaning composition<br>
can include providing flowable waxy particles comprising waxy solidification agent,<br>
sequestrant, or mixture thereof. This embodiment of the method includes putting the<br>
flowable waxy particles in a hopper or a drawer of a concrete block machine and<br>
operating the concrete block machine to produce solid cleaning composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the method includes putting the flowable waxy particles<br>
in a drawer of a concrete block machine and vibrating the flowable waxy particles in the<br>
drawer. The method also includes transferring the flowable waxy particles from the<br>
drawer into a form. Once in the form, the method includes gently pressing the flowable<br>
waxy particles in the form to produce the solid cleaning composition, vibrating the<br>
flowable waxy particles to produce the solid cleaning composition, or combination<br>
 <br>
<br>
thereof. The method then includes removing the solid cleaning composition from the<br>
form.<br>
Gently pressing can include applying pressures of about 1 to about 1000 psi to<br>
the flowable waxy particles. Vibrating can occur at about 3000 to about 6000 rpm.<br>
Vibrating can occur at about 1500 to about 3000 rpm. Vibrating can occur for about 1<br>
to about 10 sec.<br>
The present invention also relates to a solid cleaning composition. The solid<br>
cleaning composition can include waxy solidification agent, alkalinity source,<br>
sequestrant, or mixture thereof. The solid cleaning composition can include particles of<br>
cleaning composition including an interior and a surface. In the solid cleaning<br>
composition, the surfaces of adjacent particles can contact one another just enough to<br>
provide sufficient contact of the adjacent particles to provide a stable solid cleaning<br>
composition. The solid cleaning composition can be made by the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, the phrase "concrete block machine" refers to a machine that<br>
forms concrete products (e.g., blocks or pavers) from concrete and that includes<br>
apparatus for pressing, vibrating, or combination thereof concrete (or the present<br>
flowable waxy particles) in a form or mold. Such a machine is known in the product<br>
literature as a concrete product machine, concrete block machine, a masonry product<br>
machine, and the like.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Unless stated otherwise, as used herein, the term "psi" or "pounds per square<br>
inch" refers to the actual pressure applied to the material (e.g., the present flowable<br>
waxy particles) being pressed (e.g., gently pressed) or applied to the material in a<br>
plurality of forms. As used herein, psi or pounds per square inch does not refer to the<br>
gauge or hydraulic pressure measured at a point in the apparatus doing the pressing.<br>
Gauge or hydraulic pressure measured at a point in an apparatus is referred to herein as<br>
"gauge pressure".<br>
As used herein, the term "phosphate-free" refers to a composition, mixture, or<br>
ingredients that do not contain a phosphate or phosphate-containing compound or to<br>
which a phosphate or phosphate-containing compound has not been added. Should a<br>
phosphate or phosphate-containing compound be present through contamination of a<br>
phosphate-free composition, mixture, or ingredients, the level of phosphate shall be less<br>
than 0.5 wt %, may be less then 0.1 wt%, and can be less than 0.01 wt %.<br>
As used herein, the term "phosphorus-free" refers to a composition, mixture, or<br>
ingredients that do not contain phosphorus or a phosphorus-containing compound or to<br>
which phosphorus or a phosphorus-containing compound has not been added. Should<br>
phosphorus or a phosphorus-containing compound be present through contamination of<br>
a phosphorus-free composition, mixture, or ingredients, the level of phosphorus shall be<br>
less than 0.5 wt %, may be less then 0.1 wt%, and can be less than 0.01 wt %.<br>
The term "functional material" or "functional additives" refers to an active<br>
compound or material that affords desirable properties to the solid or dissolved<br>
composition. For example, the functional material can afford desirable properties to the<br>
solid composition such as enhancing solidification characteristics or dilution rate. The<br>
functional material can also, when dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous phase, provide<br>
a beneficial property to the aqueous material when used. Examples of functional<br>
materials include chelating/sequestering agent, alkalinity source, surfactant, cleaning<br>
agent, softening agent, buffer, anti-corrosion agent, bleach activators secondary<br>
hardening agent or solubility modifier, detergent filler, defoamer, anti-redeposition<br>
agent, antimicrobials, rinse aid compositions, a threshold agent or system, aesthetic<br>
 <br>
<br>
enhancing agent (i.e., dye, perfume), lubricant compositions, additional bleaching<br>
agents, functional salts, hardening agents, solubility modifiers, enzymes, other such<br>
additives or functional ingredients, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Functional<br>
materials added to a composition will vary according to the type of composition being<br>
manufactured, and the intended end use of the composition.<br>
"Cleaning" means to perform or aid in soil removal, bleaching, microbial<br>
population reduction, or combination thereof.<br>
As used herein, a solid cleaning composition refers to a cleaning composition in<br>
the form of a solid, including, but not limited to a waxy powder, a flake, a granule, a<br>
pellet, a tablet, a lozenge, a puck, a briquette, a brick, a solid block, or a unit dose. In<br>
addition, the term "solid" refers to the state of the cleaning composition under the<br>
expected conditions of storage and use of the solid cleaning composition. In general, it<br>
is expected that the cleaning composition will remain in solid form when exposed to<br>
temperatures of up to about 100 Â°F and greater than about 120 Â°F.<br>
As used herein, microbial preparation refers to a composition including one or<br>
more of spores (bacterial or fungal), vegetative bacteria, or fungi, which can be<br>
provided in a preservative. As used herein, bacteria preparation refers to a composition<br>
including bacterial spores and/or vegetative bacteria, which can be provided in a<br>
preservative. The preservative can include, for example, any or a variety of<br>
preservative compositions used in commercially supplied preparations of spores<br>
(bacterial or fungal), vegetative bacteria, or fungi. Such preservatives can include, for<br>
example, chelator, surfactant, buffer, water, or the like. The microbial preparation can,<br>
for example, digest or degrade soils such as fat, oil, grease, sugar, protein, carbohydrate,<br>
or the like.<br>
As used herein, boric acid salt and borate salt are used interchangeably to refer<br>
to a salt such as potassium borate, monoethanolamine borate, or another salt obtained<br>
by or that can be visualized as being obtained by neutralization of boric acid. The<br>
weight percent of a boric acid salt or borate salt in a composition of the present<br>
invention can be expressed either as the weight percent of either the negatively charged<br>
 <br>
<br>
boron containing ion, e.g. the borate and/or boric acid moieties, or as the weight percent<br>
of the entire boric acid salt, e.g. both the negatively charged moiety and the positively<br>
charged moiety. Preferably, the weight percent refers to the entire boric acid salt.<br>
Weight percents of citric acid salts, or other acid salts, can also be expressed in these<br>
ways, preferably with reference to the entire acid salt. As used herein, the term "total<br>
boron compound" refers to the sum of borate and boric acid moieties.<br>
As used herein, basic or alkaline pH refers to pH greater than 7, greater than or<br>
equal to 8, about 8 to about 9.5, about 8 to about 11, greater than about 9, or about 9 to<br>
about 10.5.<br>
As used herein, the terms "flooring" or "floor" refer to any horizontal surface on<br>
which a person might walk. Flooring or a floor can be made of an inorganic material,<br>
such as ceramic tile or natural stone (e.g., quarry tile), or an organic material, such as an<br>
epoxy, a polymer, a rubber, or a resilient material. The flooring or floor can be in any<br>
of a variety of environments such as a restaurant (e.g., a fast food restaurant), a food<br>
processing and/or preparation establishment, a slaughter house, a packing plant, a<br>
shortening production plant, a kitchen, or the like.<br>
As used herein, the phrases "coefficient of friction" and "slip resistance" can be<br>
defined with respect to any of a variety of standard publications, such as ASTM<br>
Standard D-2047, "Static Coefficient of Friction of Polish Coated Floor Surfaces as<br>
Measured by the James Machine" and a report by ASTM Committee D-21 which<br>
indicated that a floor having a coefficient of static friction of not less than 0.5 as<br>
measured by this test is recognized as providing a non-hazardous walkway surface.<br>
This value is qualified in NBS Technical Note 895 "An Overview of Floor Slip-<br>
Resistance, With Annotated Bibliography" by Robert J. Brungraber, wherein it is<br>
indicated that the value of 0.5 provides a factor of safety and that most people, taking<br>
normal strides, would be unlikely to slip on surfaces for which the value is greater than<br>
0.3-0.35. Other relevant and similar standards include ANSI 1264.2-2001, ASTM<br>
C1028-89, ASTM D2047-93, ASTM F1679-00 (which relates to the English XL<br>
 <br>
<br>
Tribometer), ASTM Test Method F1677-96, and UL 410 (1992). Each of the standards<br>
in this paragraph is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, weight percent (wt-%), percent by weight, % by weight, and the<br>
like are synonyms that refer to the concentration of a substance as the weight of that<br>
substance divided by the total weight of the composition and multiplied by 100.<br>
As used herein, the term "about" modifying the quantity of an ingredient in the<br>
compositions of the invention or employed in the methods of the invention refers to<br>
variation in the numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through typical<br>
measuring and liquid handling procedures used for making concentrates or use solutions<br>
in the real world; through inadvertent error in these procedures; through differences in<br>
the manufacture, source, or purity of the ingredients employed to make the<br>
compositions or carry out the methods; and the like. The term about also encompasses<br>
amounts that differ due to different equilibrium conditions for a composition resulting<br>
from a particular initial mixture. Whether or not modified by the term "about", the<br>
claims include equivalents to the quantities.<br>
Compositions<br>
The present invention relates to solid cleaning compositions and methods of<br>
making them. The present method can include pressing, vibrating, or a combination<br>
thereof (pressing and vibrating) flowable waxy particles of a waxy cleaning<br>
composition to produce a solid, such as a block or puck. As used herein, the term<br>
"waxy" when used with respect to particles, compounds or compositions (e.g., waxy<br>
particles, waxy solidification agents) refers to particles or compounds or compositions<br>
that stick, e.g., bind, together when a sufficient amount of particles are in contact with<br>
each other. If just placed in a form or mold without having pressure or vibration<br>
applied to it, flowable waxy particles of a waxy cleaning composition forms a crumbly<br>
(friable) solid. Gently pressing and/or vibrating the flowable waxy particles in a mold<br>
or form produces a stable solid. A stable solid composition retains its shape under<br>
conditions in which the composition may be stored or handled. For a waxy cleaning<br>
 <br>
composition, pressing and/or vibrating flowable waxy particles determines the shape<br>
and density of the stable solid.<br>
The waxy solid compositions include waxy solidification agent and any of a<br>
variety of cleaning agents. For example, the present solid compositions can include<br>
acidulant, antimicrobial agent (e.g., quaternary ammonium compound), alkalinity<br>
source, chelating agent, or combination thereof and water. Mixing of waxy<br>
solidification agent, alkalinity source, chelating agent, or combination thereof with<br>
water and other desired cleaning agents produces flowable waxy particles (e.g., a<br>
flowable waxy powder). Placing the flowable waxy particles into a form (e.g., a mold<br>
or container) and gently pressing and/or vibrating the waxy powder produces a stable<br>
solid.<br>
Gently pressing refers to compressing the flowable waxy particles in a container<br>
in a manner that is effective to bring a sufficient quantity of particles (e.g., granules) of<br>
the flowable waxy particles into contact with one another. Vibrating refers to moving<br>
or imparting vibrational energy to the flowable waxy particles in a container in a<br>
manner that is effective to bring a sufficient quantity of particles (e.g., granules) of the<br>
flowable waxy particles into contact with one another. In the present method, pressing<br>
and vibrating refers to moving or imparting vibrational energy to and compressing the<br>
flowable waxy particles in a container in a manner that is effective to bring a sufficient<br>
quantity of particles (e.g., granules) of the flowable waxy particles into contact with one<br>
another. A sufficient quantity of particles (e.g. granules) in contact with one another<br>
provides binding of particles to one another effective for making a stable solid<br>
composition.<br>
The method of the present invention can produce a stable solid without the high<br>
pressure compression employed in conventional tableting. A conventional tableting<br>
press applies pressures of at least about 5000 psi and even about 30,000-100,000 psi or<br>
more to a solid to produce a tablet. In contrast, the present method employs pressures<br>
on the solid of only less than or equal to about 1000 psi. In certain embodiments, the<br>
present method employs pressures of less than or equal to about 300 psi, less than or<br>
 <br>
<br>
equal to about 200 psi, or less than or equal to about 100 psi. In certain embodiments,<br>
the present method can employ pressures as low as greater than or equal to about 1 psi,<br>
greater than or equal to about 2, greater than or equal to about 5 psi, or greater than or<br>
equal to about 10 psi.<br>
The method of the present invention can produce a stable solid in any of a<br>
variety of sizes, including sizes larger than can be produced in a tableting press. A<br>
conventional tableting press can make only smaller solid products, for example, those<br>
smaller than a hockey puck (or smaller than about 600 g). The present method has been<br>
employed to produce a solid block weighing about 3 kg to about 6 kg, with a volume of,<br>
for example, 5 gal, or having dimensions of, for example, 6x6 inches or a paver-like<br>
slab 12 inches square. The present method employs a binding agent, not pressure, to<br>
provide a large stable solid.<br>
The method of the present invention can produce a stable solid without<br>
employing a melt and solidification of the melt as in conventional casting. Forming a<br>
melt requires heating a composition to melt it. The heat can be applied externally or<br>
can be produced by a chemical exotherm (e.g., from mixing caustic (sodium hydroxide)<br>
and water). Heating a composition consumes energy. Handling a hot melt requires<br>
safety precautions and equipment. Further, solidification of a melt requires cooling the<br>
melt in a container to solidify the melt and form the cast solid. Cooling requires time<br>
and/or energy. In contrast, the present method can employ ambient temperature and<br>
humidity during solidification or curing of the present compositions. Caustic<br>
compositions made according to the present method produce only a slight temperature<br>
increase due to the exotherm. The solids of the present invention are held together not<br>
by solidification from a melt but by a binding agent produced in the flowable waxy<br>
particles and that is effective for producing a stable solid.<br>
The method of the present invention can produce a stable solid without<br>
extruding to compress the mixture through a die. Conventional processes for extruding<br>
a mixture through a die to produce a solid cleaning composition apply high pressures to<br>
a solid or paste to produce the extruded solid. In contrast, the present method employs<br>
 <br>
<br>
pressures on the solid of only less than or equal to about 1000 psi or even as little as 1<br>
psi. The solids of the present invention are held together not by mere compression but<br>
by a binding agent produced in the flowable waxy particles and that is effective for<br>
producing a stable solid.<br>
Any of a variety of flowable waxy particles can be used in the method of the<br>
present invention. For example, in an embodiment, the flowable waxy particles have a<br>
consistency similar to wet sand.<br>
Methods of Making the Solid Cleaning Compositions<br>
In some aspects, the present compositions can be vibrated and gently pressed in<br>
an apparatus that can form a concrete block, concrete paver, or other shaped concrete<br>
product. Such apparatus are known variously as a concrete block machine, a concrete<br>
product machine, a masonry product machine, or the like. Another configuration of<br>
such an apparatus is known variously as a hermetic press, tamping machine, brick press,<br>
turntable press, hydraulic press, or the like.<br>
The method can include employing a concrete block machine to form the solid<br>
cleaning composition. The method can include providing the present flowable waxy<br>
particles. The flowable waxy particles are placed or provided in a drawer of the<br>
machine. The flowable waxy particles can be vibrated in the drawer. The flowable<br>
waxy particles are then transferred from the drawer into a form. Once in the form, the<br>
flowable waxy particles can be subjected to gently pressing, vibrating, or a combination<br>
thereof, in the form to produce the solid cleaning composition. The stable solid<br>
composition can then be removed from the form.<br>
The concrete block machine can vibrate the composition in the mold or form at<br>
about 200 to about 6000 rpm, about 200 to about 300 rpm, about 2500 to about 3000<br>
(e.g., 3100) rpm, about 1500 to about 3000 rpm, or about 3000 to about 6000 rpm.<br>
The concrete block machine can vibrate the composition in the mold for about 1<br>
to about 10 sec or about 1 to about 6 sec.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The concrete block machine can press the content of the mold or form with a<br>
force of about 1 to about 1000 psi, about 2 to about 300 psi, about 5 psi to about 200<br>
psi, or about 10 psi to about 100 psi. In certain embodiments, the present method<br>
employs pressures of less than or equal to about 300 psi, less than or equal to about 200<br>
psi, or less than or equal to about 100 psi. In certain embodiments, the present method<br>
can employ pressures as low as greater than or equal to about 1 psi, greater than or<br>
equal to about 2, greater than or equal to about 5 psi, or greater than or equal to about<br>
10 psi.<br>
The concrete block machine can vibrate the composition in the mold (and<br>
including the vibrating the form) at an excitation force (i.e., amplitude, centrifugal<br>
force) of, for example, about 2000 to about 6,500 lb, about 3000 to about 9000 lb, about<br>
4000 to about 13,000 lb, or about 5000 to about 15,000 lb. In certain embodiments, the<br>
vibrational force can be about 2,000 lb, about 3,000 lb, about 4,000 lb, about 5,000 lb,<br>
about 6,000 lb, about 7,000 lb, about 8,000 lb, about 9,000 lb, about 10,000 lb, about<br>
11,000 lb, about 12,000 lb, about 13,000 lb, about 14,000 lb, or about 15,000 lb.<br>
In an embodiment, the method can include vibrating the drawer containing<br>
flowable waxy particles for about 1 to about 10 sec at about 200 to about 6,000 rpm. In<br>
an embodiment, the method can include vibrating the form containing flowable waxy<br>
particles for about 1 to about 10 sec at about 200 to about 6,000 rpm. In an<br>
embodiment, the method can include such vibrating and also include pressing on the<br>
flowable waxy particles in the form with a weight of about 100 to about 2000 lb.<br>
The method employing the concrete products machine can include any of a<br>
variety of additional manipulations useful for forming the solid cleaning composition.<br>
For example, the method can include putting the flowable waxy particles into a hopper,<br>
and/or flowing or transporting the flowable waxy particles from the hopper into the<br>
drawer. The flowable waxy particles can flow from the hopper under the force of<br>
gravity into the drawer, or by being pushed into the hopper. If the hopper is positioned<br>
directly above the drawer, opening a portal on the bottom of the hopper can allow<br>
flowable waxy particles to drop into the drawer. Alternatively, the hopper can be<br>
 <br>
<br>
positioned above a ramp and the flowable waxy particles can flow down the ramp and<br>
into the drawer.<br>
The method can include vibrating and/or agitating the flowable waxy particles in<br>
the hopper, as it flows or drops from the hopper into the drawer, in the drawer as it is<br>
flowing into the drawer, once it is in the drawer, and any combination thereof.<br>
The method includes transferring the flowable waxy particles from the drawer<br>
into the form. Transferring the flowable waxy particles from the drawer into the form<br>
can be accomplished by the force of gravity. For example, the drawer can be in a<br>
position (disposed) above the form. The bottom of the drawer can be configured to<br>
slide out or be moved laterally out from under the interior of the drawer. Thus, any<br>
flowable waxy particles in the drawer will fall into the form, e.g., the cavity or cavities<br>
of the form. The method can include providing the drawer disposed above the form, the<br>
drawer including a panel disposed between an interior of the drawer and the form. The<br>
method can include laterally moving the panel to a position not between the interior of<br>
the drawer and the form. Accordingly, the flowable waxy particles drops into the form.<br>
The method can include vibrating the flowable waxy particles in the form, as it<br>
flows or drops from the drawer into the form, in the form as it is flowing into the form,<br>
once it is in the form, or any combination thereof. The method can include pressing the<br>
flowable waxy particles in the form (e.g., in the cavity or cavities of the form).<br>
The pressed and/or vibrated flowable waxy particles can be removed from the<br>
form by any of a variety of methods. For example, removing the composition from the<br>
form can include raising the form with the composition remaining on a pallet that had<br>
formed the bottom of the form, or moving the pallet horizontally away from the drawer<br>
and form.<br>
In short, the method can employ a drawer and form that are components of a<br>
concrete block machine. The concrete block machine can vibrate the flowable waxy<br>
particles in the drawer; transfer the flowable waxy particles from the drawer into a<br>
form, gently press the flowable waxy particles in the form to produce the solid cleaning<br>
composition, vibrate the flowable waxy particles to produce the solid cleaning<br>
 <br>
<br>
composition, or combination thereof; and remove the solid cleaning composition from<br>
the form (i.e., move the form off of the composition).<br>

Suitable concrete block machines include those manufactured by, for example,<br>
Columbia, Besser, Masa, Omag, or Quadra and having model numbers such as<br>
Columbia Model 15, 21, or 22; Besser SuperPac, BescoPac, or VibraPac; or Masa<br>
Extra-Large XL 6.0. These machines can produce, for example, 6-10 blocks of solid<br>
cleaning composition each weighing 1.5-3 kg in a single operation.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a concrete block machine 100 can include a drawer 1<br>
configured to receive the flowable waxy particles and to drop the flowable waxy<br>
particles into a form 3. The form 3 can define one or a plurality of cavities 5 configured<br>
to provide the desired shape of the solid cleaning composition. For example, the form 3<br>
can define cavity 5 with open top 7, form sides 9, and pallet 11.<br>
Drawer 1 can include drawer sides 13 and bottom panel 15. Bottom panel 15<br>
can be configured to be moved from beneath drawer sides 13. For example, bottom<br>
panel 15 can slideably engage drawer sides 13 so that bottom panel 15 be slid our from<br>
under drawer interior 17 defined by drawer sides 13. Concrete block machine 100 can<br>
be configured to position drawer 1 containing the present flowable waxy particles (not<br>
shown) over form 3. Concrete block machine 100 can be configured to slide bottom<br>
panel 15 out from under drawer interior 17. When drawer 1 containing the present<br>
flowable waxy particles is positioned over form 3 and bottom panel 15 is slid out from<br>
under drawer interior 17, the flowable waxy particles drops into cavity or cavities 5.<br>
Concrete block machine 100 can also include vibration system 19. Vibration<br>
system 19 can include drawer vibrator 21. Drawer vibrator 21 can be configured to<br>

system 25 can be configured to press flowable waxy particles in the cavity or cavities 5<br>
of form 3. Pressing system can include, for example, a shoe or shoes 27 configured to<br>
be moved down onto flowable waxy particles in cavity or cavities 5. Pressing system<br>
25 can be configured to press upon the flowable waxy particles in the cavity or cavities<br>
5 of form 3 at a preselected pressure (psi).<br>
Concrete block machine 100 can also include optional drawer transport 29<br>
configured to move the drawer 1 with respect to the form 3. For example, drawer<br>
transport 29 can be configured to move drawer 1 from under a hopper 31 to over form<br>
3. Alternatively, drawer 1 and hopper 31 can both be positioned over form 3. In such<br>
an embodiment, the drawer transport 29 may be absent of may be configured to move<br>
drawer 1 from over form 3, for example, for maintenance or other purposes. Hopper 31<br>
can be configured to contain sufficient flowable waxy particles for repeatedly filling the<br>
drawer 1 and the cavity or cavities 5.<br>
Concrete block machine 100 can also include form transport 33 configured to<br>
move the form 3 with respect to the drawer 1. For example, form transport 33 can be<br>
configured to move form 3 from under drawer 1 to a position at the exterior of machine<br>
100. For example, form transport 33 can be configured to raise form sides 9 while<br>
leaving the solid composition on pallet 11. Pallet 11 can then be moved to the exterior<br>
of the machine 100 so that the solid composition can be removed from the machine.<br>
Turntable Press<br>
Suitable concrete block machines include those manufactured by, for example,<br>
Schauer &amp; Hacberlc, Masa, or the like and having model names such as Multi-System-<br>
Press 970, RECORD Power WP-06 4D, UNI-2000, WKP 1200 S, or the like. These<br>
 <br>
<br>
machines can produce, for example, 6-10 blocks of solid cleaning composition each<br>
weighing 1.5-3 kg in a single operation.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a turntable press 200 can include a hopper 201 with<br>
chute 203 configured to receive the flowable solid and to drop the flowable solid into a<br>
mold 205. The mold 205 can define one or a plurality of chambers 207 configured to<br>
provide the desired shape of the solid cleaning composition. Turntable press 200 can<br>
include hopper vibrator 209 and/or mold vibrator 211 to vibrate the hopper and/or the<br>
mold, respectively, and any flowable solid that they might contain.<br>
Turntable press 200 can impart vibrational energy to the flowable solid in the<br>
hopper 201. Hopper vibrator 209 can be configured to vibrate hopper 201 and its<br>
contents at a preselected frequency (rpm) and a preselected amplitude (centrifugal<br>
force). Mold vibrator 211 can impart vibrational energy to the flowable solid in the<br>

the mold 205. Press 213 can include, for example, a ram 215 configured to be moved<br>
down onto flowable solid in mold 205 and any chamber or chambers 207. Press 213<br>
can be configured to press upon the flowable solid in the mold 205 and any chamber or<br>
chambers 207 at a preselected pressure (psi).<br>
Turntable press 200 can also include turntable 217 configured to move the mold<br>
205. For example, turntable 217 can be configured to move mold 205 from under chute<br>
203 to a position under ram 215, and then, for example, to a unloading position 219,<br>
where the turntable pressed solid 221 can be removed from the apparatus.<br>
In some aspects, the method for making a stable solid cleaning composition<br>
includes providing the flowable waxy particles including a solidification agent; and an<br>
ingredient selected from the group consisting of alkalinity source, acidulant, stabilized<br>
microbial or enzyme composition, surfactant, sequestrant, and mixtures thereof. The<br>
flowable waxy particles are transferred to a holding hopper. The holding hopper can<br>
 <br>
<br>
include an agitation blade to prevent the waxy particles from solidifying or cementing<br>
while remaining in the holding hopper. The flowable waxy particles are then fed from<br>
the holding hopper into a run hopper. The run hopper can include an agitation blade to<br>
prevent the waxy particles from solidifying or cementing while residing in the run<br>
hopper. The flowable waxy particles are then transferred from the run hopper into a<br>
cavity on a load cell. Any desired amount of flowable particles can be placed into the<br>
cavity. The amount of flowable waxy particles placed into the cavity can be measured<br>
by the load cell. The flowable waxy particles are then subjected to gentle pressing,<br>
vibration, or a combination of both, in the cavity to produce the stable solid cleaning<br>
composition. The stable solid cleaning composition is then removed from the cavity.<br>
Additional Methods for Pressing and/or Vibrating<br>
The present solid composition can be made by an advantageous method of<br>
pressing and/or vibrating the solid composition. The method of pressing and/or<br>
vibrating the composition includes mixing the desired ingredients in the desired<br>
proportions, for example, with a ribbon or other known blender to form the flowable<br>
waxy particles. In an embodiment, the method then includes forming the solid cleaning<br>
composition from the mixed ingredients by placing the flowable waxy particles in a<br>
mold, pressing and/or vibrating the flowable waxy particles in the mold to form a stable<br>
solid composition, and recovering the composition from the mold.<br>
Pressing can employ low pressures compared to conventional pressures used to<br>
form tablets or other conventional solid cleaning compositions. For example, in an<br>
embodiment, the present method employs a pressure on the solid of only less than or<br>
equal to about 1000 psi. In certain embodiments, the present method employs pressures<br>
of less than or equal to about 300 psi, less than or equal to about 200 psi, or less than or<br>
equal to about 100 psi. In certain embodiments, the present method can employ<br>
pressures as low as greater than or equal to about 1 psi, greater than or equal to about 2,<br>
greater than or equal to about 5 psi, or greater than or equal to about 10 psi. In certain<br>
embodiments, the present method can employ pressures of about 1 to about 1000 psi,<br>
 <br>
<br>
about 2 to about 300 psi, about 5 psi to about 200 psi, or about 10 psi to about 100 psi.<br>
Such pressing is referred to herein as "gentle pressing."<br>
In some embodiments, the solid compositions are formed by a method including<br>
vibrating. This embodiment includes forming the solid cleaning composition from the<br>

containing the flowable waxy particles, vibrating the flowable waxy particles in the<br>
mold, vibrating the flowable waxy particles before or as it is put into the mold, or<br>
combination thereof to form the composition, and recovering the pressed and/or<br>
vibrated composition from the mold.<br>
Vibrating can include any of a variety of methods for imparting vibrational<br>
energy to the mold of the mixed ingredients. For example, vibrating can include<br>
vibrating a plurality of molds containing the mixed ingredients on a platform. For<br>
example, vibrating can include inserting a vibrating probe into the mixed ingredients in<br>
the mold. For example, vibrating can include placing a vibrating surface or object onto<br>
the mixed ingredients in the mold.<br>
Vibrating can also include vibrating the flowable waxy particles before or at<br>
substantially the same time as the flowable waxy particles are placed in the mold. The<br>
flowable waxy particles can be stored or provided as a quantity sufficient for producing<br>
hundreds or thousands of pounds of solid cleaning composition. For example, an<br>
amount of flowable waxy particles sufficient to fill several molds or forms can be<br>
placed in a container (e.g., a drawer) and vibrated in the container. The flowable waxy<br>
particles can be vibrated as it is moved (e.g., dropped) from the container into the mold<br>
or form.<br>
Vibrating effective for forming the present solids includes vibrating at about 200<br>
to about 6000 rpm, about 200 to about 300 rpm, about 2500 to about 3000 (e.g., 3100)<br>
rpm, about 1500 to about 3000 rpm, or about 3000 to about 6000 rpm.<br>
Vibrating can be conducted for about 1 to about 10 sec or about 1 to about 6 sec.<br>
Suitable apparatus for vibrating the composition includes a concrete block machine or<br>
concrete products machine.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In certain embodiments, the vibration can be quantified as the amount of<br>

4,000 lb, about 5,000 lb, about 6,000 lb, about 7,000 lb, about 8,000 lb, about 9,000 lb,<br>
about 10,000 lb, about 11,000 lb, about 12,000 lb, about 13,000 lb, about 14,000 lb, or<br>
about 15,000 lb. In certain embodiments, the amount of vibrational force is about 100<br>
lb, about 200 lb, about 300 lb, about 400 lb, about 500 lb, about 600 lb, about 700 lb,<br>
about 800 lb, about 900 lb, about 1,000, about 1,500 lb, about 2,000 lb, about 3,000 lb,<br>

9,000 lb, about 10,000 lb, about 11,000 lb, about 12,000 lb, about 13,000 lb, about<br>
14,000 lb, or about 15,000 lb. Employing a concrete products machine, the amount of<br>
vibrational force applied to the flowable waxy particles, mold or form, and moving<br>
parts of the machine can be about 2000 to about 6,500 lb, about 3000 to about 9000 lb,<br>
about 4000 to about 13,000 lb, or about 5000 to about 15,000 lb.<br>
The mold can be coated with a release layer to ease release of the solid<br>
composition from the mold.<br>
The method can operate on any of a variety of waxy compositions. The<br>
composition can be, for example, a flowable waxy powder or a waxy paste. Suitable<br>
flowable waxy powders include a waxy powder and a wetted waxy powder. The<br>
method can operate on a waxy composition that can flow or be dropped into and fill the<br>
mold.<br>
Solid Cleaning Compositions<br>
In some aspects, the present invention provides solid cleaning compositions<br>
including a waxy solidification agent, and other ingredients. Some examples of<br>
 <br>
representative constituent concentrations for embodiments of the present compositions<br>
can be found in Table A, in which the values are given in wt-% of the ingredients in<br>
reference to the total composition weight. In certain embodiments, the proportions and<br>
amounts in Table A can be modified by "about".<br>
 <br>
The waxy solidification agent can be an anionic surfactant such as sodium alkyl<br>
benzene sulfonate alone or as a mixture with sodium laurel sulfate and/or sodium laurel<br>
ether sulfate. The waxy solidification agent can be urea.<br>
The present solid product can be formulated with ingredients for use as, for<br>
example, an air freshener, a urinal block, a drain ring, or a laundry bar.<br>
Solidification Agents<br>
The waxy solid compositions can include a waxy solidification agent. The<br>
waxy solidification agent in the present compositions participates in maintaining the<br>
 <br>
<br>
compositions in a solid form. Although other components of the solid composition may<br>
also be solids, the solidification agent can maintain the overall composition including<br>
solid and liquid components in a solid form. A waxy solidification agent can be a<br>
compound or system of compounds that significantly contributes to the uniform<br>
solidification of the composition. The waxy solidification agent should also be capable<br>
of forming a matrix with the cleaning agent and other ingredients when mixed and<br>
solidified to provide a uniform dissolution of the cleaning agent from the solid cleaning<br>
composition during use. The solidification agent can also provide cleaning power or<br>
antimicrobial activity to the composition.<br>
The amount of solidification agent included in the solid cleaning composition<br>
will vary according to factors including, but not limited to: the type of solid cleaning<br>
composition being prepared, the ingredients of the solid cleaning composition, the<br>
intended use of the composition, the quantity of dispensing solution applied to the solid<br>
composition over time during use, the temperature of the dispensing solution, the<br>
hardness of the dispensing solution, the physical size of the solid cleaning composition,<br>
the concentration of the other ingredients, and the concentration of the cleaning agent in<br>
the composition. It is preferred that the amount of the solidification agent included in<br>
the solid cleaning composition is effective to combine with the cleaning agent and other<br>
ingredients of the composition to form a homogeneous mixture under continuous<br>
mixing conditions and a temperature at or below the melting temperature of the<br>
solidification agent.<br>
The amount of the solidification agent included in the solid cleaning<br>
composition is effective to provide a desired hardness and desired rate of controlled<br>
solubility of the processed composition when placed in an aqueous medium to achieve a<br>
desired rate of dispensing the cleaning agent from the solidified composition during use.<br>
In some embodiments, the solidification agent can assist the source of alkalinity in<br>
maintaining the solid cleaning composition in solid form. In other embodiments, the<br>
solidification agent is compatible with the cleaning agent and other active ingredients of<br>
 <br>
<br>
the composition and are capable of providing an effective amount of hardness and/or<br>
aqueous solubility to the processed composition.<br>
Suitable waxy solidification agents include, but are not limited to: a solid<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG); anionic surfactants; a solid EO/PO block copolymer, and<br>
the like; an amide, such as stearic monoethanolamide, lauric diethanolamide, an<br>
alkylamide, or the like; high melt alcohol ethoxylate (e.g., C12-C14 alcohol ethoxylate<br>

ethoxylate, C14-15 alcohol ethoxylate with 13 mole ethoxylate, C6 alcohol ethoxylate<br>
with 20 mole ethoxylate), or the like; waxes, e.g., paraffin; other generally functional or<br>
inert materials with high melting points; and the like. Additional suitable solidification<br>

amide; and the like.<br>
Polyethylene Glycol<br>
The waxy solidification agent may be an organic waxy solidification agent. A<br>
suitable organic solidification agent is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) compound. The<br>
solidification rate of solid cleaning compositions comprising a polyethylene glycol<br>
solidification agent will vary, at least in part, according to the amount and the molecular<br>
weight of the polyethylene glycol added to the composition. Examples of suitable<br>
polyethylene glycols include, but are not limited to: solid polyethylene glycols of the<br>
general formula H(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n is greater than 15, particularly<br>
approximately 30 to approximately 1700. Typically, the polyethylene glycol is a solid<br>
in the form of a free-flowing powder or flakes, having a molecular weight of<br>
approximately 1,000 to approximately 100,000, particularly having a molecular weight<br>
of at least approximately 1,450 to approximately 20,000, more particularly between<br>
approximately 1,450 to approximately 8,000.<br>

PEG 3350, PEG 4500, PEG 8000, PEG 20,000, and the like. In certain embodiments,<br>
the solidification agent includes a combination of solidification agents, such as<br>
combination of PEG and an EO/PO block copolymer (such as a Pluronic) and<br>
combination of PEG and an amide (such as lauric diethanol amide or stearic<br>
monoethanol amide).<br>
Anionic Surfactant<br>
The present composition can include an anionic surfactant as solidification<br>
agent. Suitable anionic surfactants include organic sulfonate surfactant, organic sulfate<br>
surfactant, phosphate ester surfactant, carboxylate surfactant, mixtures thereof, or the<br>
like. In an embodiment, the anionic surfactant includes alkyl sulfonate, alkylaryl<br>
sulfonate, alkylated diphenyl oxide disulfonate, alkylated naphthalene sulfonate,<br>
alcohol alkoxylate carboxylate, sarcosinate, taurate, acyl amino acid, alkanoic ester,<br>
phosphate ester, sulfuric acid ester, salt or acid form thereof, or mixture thereof. The<br>
particular salts will be suitably selected depending upon the particular formulation and<br>
the needs therein.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants include sulfonic acids (and salts), such as<br>
isethionates (e.g. acyl iscthionates), alkylaryl sulfonic acids and salts thereof, alkyl<br>
sulfonates, and the like.<br>
Examples of suitable synthetic, water soluble anionic cleaning compounds<br>
include the ammonium and substituted ammonium (such as mono-, di- and<br>
triethanolamine) and alkali metal (such as sodium, lithium and potassium) salts of the<br>
 <br>
<br>
alkyl mononuclear aromatic sulfonates such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates containing<br>
from about 5 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group in a straight or branched<br>
chain, e.g., the salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates or of alkyl toluene, xylene, cumene and<br>
phenol sulfonates; alkyl naphthalene sulfonate, diamyl naphthalene sulfonate, and<br>
dinonyl naphthalene sulfonate and alkoxylated derivatives or their free acids. Suitable<br>
sulfonates include olefin sulfonates, such as long chain alkene sulfonates, long chain<br>
hydroxyalkane sulfonates or mixtures of alkenesulfonates and hydroxyalkane-<br>
sulfonates.<br>
In certain embodiments, the present compositions including an anionic<br>
surfactant, such as a normal C8 sulfonate, can be non-foam or low foam compositions.<br>
Such compositions can be advantageous for applications such as clean in place,<br>
machine warewashing, destaining, and sanitizing, laundry washing, destaining, and<br>
sanitizing, etc.<br>
Anionic sulfate surfactants suitable for use in the present compositions include<br>
alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl sulfates, the linear and branched primary and secondary alkyl<br>
sulfates, alkyl ethoxysulfates, fatty oleyl glycerol sulfates, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide<br>
ether sulfates, the C5 -C(7 acyl-N-(Ci -C4 alkyl) and -N-(Ci -C2 hydroxyalkyl)<br>

alkylpolyglucoside, and the like. Also included are the alkyl sulfates, alkyl<br>
poly(ethyleneoxy) ether sulfates and aromatic poly(ethyleneoxy) sulfates such as the<br>
sulfates or condensation products of ethylene oxide and nonyl phenol (usually having 1<br>
to 6 oxyethylene groups per molecule).<br>
Urea<br>
Urea particles can also be employed as solidification agents and/or hardeners in<br>
the solid cleaning compositions. The solidification rate of the compositions will vary,<br>
at least in part, to factors including, but not limited to: the amount, the particle size, and<br>
the shape of the urea added to the composition. For example, a particulate form of urea<br>
can be combined with a cleaning agent and other ingredients, and preferably a minor<br>
 <br>
<br>
but effective amount of water. The amount and particle size of the urea is effective to<br>
combine with the cleaning agent and other ingredients to form a homogeneous mixture<br>
without the application of heat from an external source to melt the urea and other<br>
ingredients to a molten stage. It is preferred that the amount of urea included in the<br>
solid cleaning composition is effective to provide a desired hardness and desired rate of<br>
solubility of the composition when placed in an aqueous medium to achieve a desired<br>
rate of dispensing the cleaning agent from the solidified composition during use. In<br>
some embodiments, the composition includes between approximately 5% to<br>
approximately 90% by weight urea, particularly between approximately 8% and<br>
approximately 40% by weight urea, and more particularly between approximately 10%<br>
and approximately 30% by weight urea.<br>
The urea may be in the form of prilled beads or powder. Prilled urea is generally<br>
available from commercial sources as a mixture of particle sizes ranging from about 8-<br>
15 U.S. mesh, as for example, from Arcadian Sohio Company, Nitrogen Chemicals<br>
Division. A prilled form of urea is preferably milled to reduce the particle size to about<br>
50 U.S. mesh to about 125 U.S. mesh, particularly about 75-100 U.S. mesh, preferably<br>
using a wet mill such as a single or twin-screw extruder, a Teledyne mixer, a Ross<br>
emulsifier, and the like.<br>
Source of Alkalinity<br>
The solid cleaning composition according to the invention includes an effective<br>
amount of one or more alkaline sources to enhance cleaning of a substrate and improve<br>
soil removal performance of the composition. In general, an effective amount of one or<br>
more alkaline sources should be considered as an amount that provides a use<br>
composition having a pH of at least about 8. When the use composition has a pH of<br>
between about 8 and about 10, it can be considered mildly alkaline, and when the pH is<br>
greater than about 12, the use composition can be considered caustic. In general, it is<br>
desirable to provide the use composition as a mildly alkaline cleaning composition<br>
because it is considered to be safer than the caustic based use compositions.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The solid cleaning composition can include an alkali metal carbonate and/or an<br>
alkali metal hydroxide. Suitable metal carbonates that can be used include, for<br>
example, sodium or potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate, mixtures<br>
thereof. Suitable alkali metal hydroxides that can be used include, for example, sodium,<br>
lithium, or potassium hydroxide. An alkali metal hydroxide can be added to the<br>
composition in the form of solid beads, dissolved in an aqueous solution, or a<br>
combination thereof. Alkali metal hydroxides are commercially available as a solid in<br>
the form of prilled solids or beads having a mix of particle sizes ranging from about 12-<br>
100 U.S. mesh, or as an aqueous solution, as for example, as a 50 wt-% and a 73 wt-%<br>
solution.<br>
The solid cleaning composition can include a sufficient amount of the alkaline<br>
source to provide the use composition with a pH of at least about 8. The source of<br>
alkalinity is preferably in an amount to enhance the cleaning of a substrate and improve<br>
soil removal performance of the composition. In general, it is expected that the<br>
concentrate will include the alkaline source in an amount of at least about 5 wt-%, at<br>
least about 10 wt-%, or at least about 15 wt-%. The solid cleaning composition can<br>
include between about 10 wt-% and about 80 wt-%, preferably between about 15 wt-%<br>
and about 70 wt-%, and even more preferably between about 20 wt-% and about 60 wt-<br>
% of the source of alkalinity. The source of alkalinity can additionally be provided in<br>
an amount to neutralize the anionic surfactant and can be used to assist in the<br>
solidification of the composition.<br>
In order to provide sufficient room for other components in the concentrate, the<br>
alkaline source can be provided in the concentrate in an amount of less than about 60<br>
wt-%. In addition, the alkaline source can be provided at a level of less than about 40<br>
wt-%, less than about 30 wt-%, or less than about 20 wt-%. In certain embodiments, it<br>
is expected that the solid cleaning composition can provide a use composition that is<br>
useful at pH levels below about 8. In such compositions, an alkaline source can be<br>
omitted, and additional pH adjusting agents can be used to provide the use composition<br>
 <br>
<br>
with the desired pH. Accordingly, it should be understood that the source of alkalinity<br>
can be characterized as an optional component.<br>
For compositions including carboxylate as a component of the binding agent,<br>
the solid cleaning composition can include about 75 wt-%, less than about 60 wt-%, less<br>
than about 40 wt-%, less than about 30 wt-%, or less than about 20 wt-%. The<br>
alkalinity source may constitute about 0.1 to about 90 wt-%, about 0.5 to about 80 wt-<br>
%, or about 1 to about 60 wt-% of the total weight of the solid cleaning composition.<br>
Secondary Alkalinity Sources<br>
In some embodiments, a solid of the present invention can include effective<br>
amounts of one or more inorganic detergents or alkaline sources to enhance cleaning of<br>
a substrate and improve soil removal performance of the composition. As discussed<br>
above, in embodiments including an alkali metal salt, such as alkali metal carbonate, the<br>
alkali metal salt can act as an alkalinity source. The composition may include a<br>
secondary alkaline source separate from the source of alkalinity, and that secondary<br>
source can include about 0 to 75 wt-%, about 0.1 to 70 wt-% of, 1 to 25 wt-%, or about<br>
20 to 60 wt-%, or 30 to 70 wt-% of the total composition.<br>
Additional alkalinity sources can include, for example, inorganic alkalinity<br>
sources, such as an alkali metal hydroxide or silicate, or the like. Suitable alkali metal<br>
hydroxides include, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide. An alkali metal<br>
hydroxide may be added to the composition in a variety of forms, including for example<br>
in the form of solid beads, dissolved in an aqueous solution, or a combination thereof.<br>
Alkali metal hydroxides are commercially available as a solid in the form of prilled<br>
solids or beads having a mix of particle sizes ranging from about 12-100 U.S. mesh, or<br>
as an aqueous solution, as for example, as a 50 wt-% and a 73 wt-% solution.<br>
Examples of useful alkaline metal silicates include sodium or potassium silicate<br>
(with a M2O:SiO2 ratio of 1:2.4 to 5:1, M representing an alkali metal) or metasilicate.<br>
Other sources of alkalinity include a metal borate such as sodium or potassium<br>
borate, and the like; ethanolamines and amines; and other like alkaline sources.<br>

Water<br>
A solid cleaning composition can include water. Water can be independently<br>
added to the cleaning composition or can be provided in the composition as a result of<br>
its presence in an aqueous material that is added to the composition. Typically, water is<br>
introduced into the cleaning composition to provide the cleaning composition with a<br>
desired flowability prior to solidification and to provide a desired rate of solidification.<br>
In certain embodiments of the solid cleaning composition, water can be present at about<br>
0 to about 10 wt-%, about 0.1 to about 10 wt-%, about 2 to about 10 wt-%, about 1 to<br>
about 5 wt-%, or about 2 to about 3 wt-%.<br>
Solid Compositions Including A Stabilized Microbial Preparation and/or Enzyme<br>
The present solid composition can include a borate salt and spores (bacterial or<br>
fungal), vegetative bacteria, fungi, or enzyme. The present solid composition can<br>
include, for example, solidification agent and stabilized microbial preparation. The<br>
present solid composition can include, for example, solidification agent and stabilized<br>
enzyme preparation. The present solid composition can include, for example,<br>
solidification agent, stabilized microbial preparation, and stabilized enzyme preparation<br>
(e.g., stabilized microbial and enzyme preparation). The present composition can also<br>
include one or more of surfactant or surfactant blend, chelating agent, sodium<br>
carbonate, or other ingredients useful for cleaning. The present invention also includes<br>
methods of using these compositions.<br>
The present composition can provide advantageous stability of spores (bacterial<br>
or fungal), vegetative bacteria, fungi, or enzyme. In an embodiment, the present solid<br>
including borate salt can provide advantageous stability of the spores (bacterial or<br>
 <br>
<br>
fungal), vegetative bacteria, fungi, or enzyme in the solid composition. For example,<br>
the solid can retain acceptable levels (e.g., &gt;70% initial activity) of active/living spores<br>
(bacterial or fungal), vegetative bacteria, fungi, or enzyme for one year, two years, or<br>
longer.<br>
The present solid composition can include a stabilized microbial preparation<br>
including a borate salt and microbe. The microbe can be in the form of spores (bacterial<br>
or fungal), vegetative bacteria, or fungi. The microbial preparation can include, for<br>
example, spores or spore blend that can digest or degrade soils such as grease, oils (e.g.,<br>
vegetable oils or animal fat), protein, carbohydrate, or the like. The microbial<br>
preparation can also produce enzymes that aid in the degradation of soils such as<br>
grease, oil, fat, protein, carbohydrate, or the like. The borate salt can include any of a<br>
variety of salts of boric acid, for example, alkali metal salts or alkanol amine salts. The<br>
boric acid salt can provide a source of alkalinity for a solid cleaning composition<br>
including the stabilized microbial preparation.<br>
In an embodiment, the present stabilized microbial preparation is a component<br>
of a cleaning composition. Although not limiting to the present invention, the microbial<br>
preparation can be viewed as a source of detersive enzyme in the cleaning composition.<br>
Such a cleaning composition can also include additional enzymes, not produced by the<br>
microbial preparation in situ. The microbial preparation can produce, for example,<br>
enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and/or amylases. The composition can also include<br>
other added enzymes, such as, for example, proteases, lipases, and/or amylases.<br>
Although not limiting to the present invention, the added enzymes can be viewed as<br>
providing immediate cleaning upon application of the cleaning composition, and the<br>
microbial preparation can be viewed as providing persistent cleaning as the microbes<br>
remain on the article being cleaned, even after rinsing.<br>
Most cleaners can only provide soil removal which is actually just moving the<br>
soil from one surface or location (e.g., a floor) to another (e.g., a drain). In certain<br>
embodiments, cleaning compositions including the present stabilized microbial<br>
 <br>
<br>
preparation can provide both soil removal and persistent soil reduction, through<br>
persistent enzymatic breakdown of soils.<br>
The present solid composition can include a stabilized enzyme preparation<br>
including a borate salt and enzyme. The enzyme can be a detersive enzyme. The<br>
enzyme preparation can include, for example, enzyme or enzyme blend that can digest<br>
or degrade soils such as grease, oils (e.g., vegetable oils or animal fat), protein,<br>
carbohydrate, or the like. The borate salt can include any of a variety of salts of boric<br>
acid, for example, alkali metal salts or alkanol amine salts. The boric acid salt can<br>
provide a source of alkalinity for a cleaning composition including the stabilized<br>
enzyme preparation.<br>
Solid cleaning compositions including the present stabilized enzyme or<br>
microbial preparations can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a floor<br>
cleaner, as a grout cleaner, as a combination floor and drain cleaner and<br>
degreaser/grease digester, as a grease digester in grease traps, for effluent and/or<br>
wastewater treatment (e.g., reduction of fats, oils, and greases), in municipal waste<br>
treatment, as a grease digester in rendering plants, or for black and gray water treatment<br>
on cruise ships.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the<br>
present stable solid cleaning compositions including microbial or enzyme compositions<br>
can break down grease or oil on a surface. Breaking down the grease or oil can release<br>
other soil stuck in the grease or oil. Accordingly, the present solid composition can<br>
clean a surface. In an embodiment, the present invention includes a method including<br>
repeating application of the present solid stable microbial or enzyme composition. For<br>
example, the present method can include daily application. Application for five to 21<br>
days, or even in certain circumstances 5-14 days, can clean a lightly soiled surface.<br>
Application for three to six weeks can clean a heavily soiled surface.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention can be<br>
described by the ingredients and amounts listed in the tables below. The ingredients of<br>
the stabilized microbial composition and/or the stabilized enzyme composition are not<br>
 <br>
listed in the tables below, but are described herein. The amounts or ranges in these<br>
tables can also be modified by about.<br>

In an embodiment, the spores (bacterial or fungal), vegetative bacteria, or fungi<br>
include strains of Bacillus specifically adapted for high production of extracellular<br>
enzymes, particularly proteases, amylases and cellulases. Such strains are common in<br>
waste treatment products. This mixture can include Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus<br>

10 wt-%, about 1 to about 3 wt-%, about 2 wt-%, about 3 wt-%, or about 4 wt-%. The<br>
present solid composition can include these amounts or ranges not modified by about.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Enzymes<br>
The present cleaning composition can include one or more enzymes, which can<br>
provide desirable activity for removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or<br>
triglyceride-based stains from substrates; for cleaning, destaining, and presoaks.<br>
Although not limiting to the present invention, enzymes suitable for the present<br>
cleaning compositions can act by degrading or altering one or more types of soil<br>
residues encountered on a surface or textile thus removing the soil or making the soil<br>
more removable by a surfactant or other component of the cleaning composition. Both<br>
degradation and alteration of soil residues can improve detergency by reducing the<br>
physicochemical forces which bind the soil to the surface or textile being cleaned, i.e.<br>
the soil becomes more water soluble. For example, one or more proteases can cleave<br>
complex, macromolecular protein structures present in soil residues into simpler short<br>
chain molecules which are, of themselves, more readily desorbed from surfaces,<br>
solubilized or otherwise more easily removed by detersive solutions containing said<br>
proteases.<br>
Suitable enzymes include a protease, an amylase, a lipase, a gluconase, a<br>
cellulase, a peroxidase, or a mixture thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable,<br>
animal, bacterial, fungal or yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors<br>
such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active<br>
detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are<br>
preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases. Preferably<br>
the enzyme is a protease, a lipase, an amylase, or a combination thereof.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means an enzyme having a cleaning,<br>
destaining or otherwise beneficial effect as a component of a composition for laundry,<br>
textiles, warewashing, cleaning-in-place, drains, floors, carpets, medical or dental<br>
instruments, meat cutting tools, hard surfaces, personal care, or the like. Suitable<br>
detersive enzymes include a hydrolase such as a protease, an amylase, a lipase, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into a composition according to the<br>
invention in an amount sufficient to yield effective cleaning during a washing or<br>
presoaking procedure. An amount effective for cleaning refers to an amount that<br>
produces a clean, sanitary, and, preferably, corrosion free appearance to the material<br>
cleaned. An amount effective for cleaning also can refer to an amount that produces a<br>
cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving<br>
effect on substrates. Typically such a cleaning effect can be achieved with amounts of<br>
enzyme from about 0.1% to about 3% by weight, preferably about 1% to about 3% by<br>
weight, of the cleaning composition. Higher active levels may also be desirable in<br>
highly concentrated cleaning formulations.<br>
Commercial enzymes, such as alkaline proteases, are obtainable in liquid or<br>
dried form, are sold as raw aqueous solutions or in assorted purified, processed and<br>
compounded forms, and include about 2% to about 80% by weight active enzyme<br>
generally in combination with stabilizers, buffers, cofactors, impurities and inert<br>
vehicles. The actual active enzyme content depends upon the method of manufacture<br>
and is not critical, assuming the composition has the desired enzymatic activity. The<br>
particular enzyme chosen for use in the process and products of this invention depends<br>
upon the conditions of final utility, including the physical product form, use pH, use<br>
temperature, and soil types to be digested, degraded, or altered. The enzyme can be<br>
chosen to provide optimum activity and stability for any given set of utility conditions.<br>
The compositions of the present invention preferably include at least a protease.<br>
The composition of the invention has further been found, surprisingly, not only to<br>
stabilize protease for a substantially extended shelf life, but also to significantly<br>
enhance protease activity toward digesting proteins and enhancing soil removal.<br>
Further, enhanced protease activity occurs in the presence of one or more additional<br>
enzymes, such as amylase, cellulase, lipase, peroxidase, endoglucanase enzymes and<br>
mixtures thereof, preferably lipase or amylase enzymes.<br>
The enzyme can be selected for the type of soil targeted by the cleaning<br>
composition or present at the site or surface to be cleaned. Although not limiting to the<br>
 <br>
<br>
present invention, it is believed that amylase can be advantageous for cleaning soils<br>
containing starch, such as potato, pasta, oatmeal, baby food, gravy, chocolate, or the<br>
like. Although not limiting to the present invention, it is believed that protease can be<br>
advantageous for cleaning soils containing protein, such as blood, cutaneous scales,<br>
mucus, grass, food (e.g., egg, milk, spinach, meat residue, tomato sauce), or the like.<br>
Although not limiting to the present invention, it is believed that lipase can be<br>
advantageous for cleaning soils containing fat, oil, or wax, such as animal or vegetable<br>
fat, oil, or wax (e.g., salad dressing, butter, lard, chocolate, lipstick). Although not<br>
limiting to the present invention, it is believed that cellulase can be advantageous for<br>
cleaning soils containing cellulose or containing cellulose fibers that serve as<br>
attachment points for other soil.<br>
The enzyme can include detersive enzyme. The detersive enzyme can include<br>
protease, amylase, lipase, cellulase, peroxidase, gluconase, or mixtures thereof. The<br>
detersive enzyme can include alkaline protease, lipase, amylase, or mixtures thereof.<br>

Protease<br>
A protease suitable for the composition of the present invention can be derived<br>
from a plant, an animal, or a microorganism. Preferably the protease is derived from a<br>
microorganism, such as a yeast, a mold, or a bacterium. Preferred proteases include<br>
serine proteases active at alkaline pH, preferably derived from a strain of Bacillus such<br>
as Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis; these preferred proteases include native<br>
and recombinant subtilisins. The protease can be purified or a component of a<br>
microbial extract, and either wild type or variant (either chemical or recombinant). A<br>
preferred protease is neither inhibited by a metal chelating agent (sequestrant) or a thiol<br>
poison nor activated by metal ions or reducing agents, has a broad substrate specificity,<br>
is inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), is an endopeptidase, has a molecular<br>
 <br>
<br>
weight in the range of about 20,000 to about 40,000, and is active at a pH of about 6 to<br>
about 12 and at temperatures in a range from about 20Â°C to about 80Â°C.<br>
Examples of proteolytic enzymes which can be employed in the composition of<br>
the invention include (with trade names) SavinaseÂ®; a protease derived from Bacillus<br>
lentus type, such as Maxacal , Opticlean , Durazym , and ProperaseÂ®; a protease<br>
derived from Bacillus licheniformis, such as AlcalaseÂ® and MaxataseÂ®; and a protease<br>
derived from Bacillus amyloUquefaciens, such as PrimaseÂ®. Preferred commercially<br>
available protease enzymes include those sold under the trade names AlcalaseÂ®,<br>
SavinaseÂ®, PrimaseÂ®, DurazymÂ®, or EsperaseÂ® by Novo Industries A/S (Denmark);<br>
those sold under the trade names MaxataseÂ®, MaxacalÂ®, or MaxapemÂ® by Gist-<br>
Brocades (Netherlands); those sold under the trade names PurafectÂ®, Purafect OX, and<br>
Properase by Genencor International; those sold under the trade names OpticleanÂ® or<br>
OptimaseÂ® by Solvay Enzymes; and the like. A mixture of such proteases can also be<br>
used. For example, PurafectÂ® is a preferred alkaline protease (a subtilisin) for use in<br>
cleaning compositions of this invention having application in lower temperature<br>
cleaning programs, from about 30Â°C to about 65Â°C; whereas, EsperaseÂ® is an alkaline<br>
protease of choice for higher temperature detersive solutions, from about 50Â°C to about<br>
85Â°C. Suitable detersive proteases are described in patent publications including: GB<br>
1,243,784, WO 9203529 A (enzyme/inhibitor system), WO 9318140 A, and WO<br>
9425583 (recombinant trypsin-like protease) to Novo; WO 9510591 A, WO 9507791 (a<br>
protease having decreased adsorption and increased hydrolysis), WO 95/30010, WO<br>
95/30011, WO 95/29979, to Procter &amp; Gamble; WO 95/10615 {Bacillus<br>
amyloUquefaciens subtilisin) to Genencor International; EP 130,756 A (protease A); EP<br>
303,761 A (protease B); and EP 130,756 A. A variant protease employed in the present<br>
solid compositions is preferably at least 80% homologous, preferably having at least<br>
80% sequence identity, with the amino acid sequences of the proteases in these<br>
references.<br>
In some embodiments, the amount of commercial alkaline protease present in<br>
the composition of the invention ranges from about 0.1% by weight of detersive<br>
 <br>
<br>
solution to about 3% by weight, preferably about 1% to about 3% by weight, preferably<br>
about 2% by weight, of solution of the commercial enzyme product. Typical<br>
commercially available detersive enzymes include about 5-10% of active enzyme.<br>
Whereas establishing the percentage by weight of commercial alkaline protease<br>
required is of practical convenience for manufacturing embodiments of the present<br>
teaching, variance in commercial protease concentrates and in-situ environmental<br>
additive and negative effects upon protease activity require a more discerning analytical<br>
technique for protease assay to quantify enzyme activity and establish correlations to<br>
soil residue removal performance and to enzyme stability within the preferred<br>
embodiment; and, if a concentrate, to use-dilution solutions. The activity of the<br>
proteases for use in the present invention are readily expressed in terms of activity units<br>
â more specifically, Kilo-Novo Protease Units (KNPU) which are azocasein assay<br>
activity units well known to the art. A more detailed discussion of the azocasein assay<br>
procedure can be found in the publication entitled "The Use of Azoalbumin as a<br>
Substrate in the Colorimetric Determination of Peptic and Tryptic Activity", Tomarelli,<br>
R.M., Charney, J., and Harding, M.L., J. Lab. Clin. Chem. 34, 428 (1949).<br>
In some embodiments, the activity of proteases present in the use-solution<br>
ranges from about 1 x 10-5 KNPU/gm solution to about 4 x 10"3 KNPU/gm solution.<br>
Mixtures of different proteolytic enzymes may be incorporated into this<br>
invention. While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be<br>
understood that any protease which can confer the desired proteolytic activity to the<br>
composition may be used and this embodiment of this invention is not limited in any<br>
way by specific choice of proteolytic enzyme.<br>
Amylase<br>
An amylase suitable for the composition of the present invention can be derived<br>
from a plant, an animal, or a microorganism. Preferably the amylase is derived from a<br>
microorganism, such as a yeast, a mold, or a bacterium. Preferred amylases include<br>
those derived from a Bacillus, such as B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B.<br>
 <br>
<br>
subtilis, or B. stearothermophilus. The amylase can be purified or a component of a<br>
microbial extract, and either wild type or variant (either chemical or recombinant),<br>
preferably a variant that is more stable under washing or presoak conditions than a wild<br>
type amylase.<br>
Examples of amylase enzymes that can be employed in the composition of the<br>
invention include those sold under the trade name Rapidase by Gist-BrocadesÂ®<br>
(Netherlands); those sold under the trade names TermamylÂ®, FungamylÂ® or DuramylÂ®<br>
by Novo; Purastar STL or Purastar OXAM by Genencor; and the like. Preferred<br>
commercially available amylase enzymes include the stability enhanced variant amylase<br>
sold under the trade name DuramylÂ® by Novo. A mixture of amylases can also be used.<br>
Amylases suitable for the compositions of the present invention include: a-<br>
amylases described in WO 95/26397, PCT/DK96/00056, and GB 1,296,839 to Novo;<br>
and stability enhanced amylases described in J. Biol. Chem., 260(11):6518-6521<br>
(1985); WO 9510603 A, WO 9509909 A and WO 9402597 to Novo; references<br>
disclosed in WO 9402597; and WO 9418314 to Genencor International. A variant a-<br>
amylase employed in the present solid compositions can be at least 80% homologous,<br>
preferably having at least 80% sequence identity, with the amino acid sequences of the<br>
proteins of these references.<br>
Suitable amylases for use in the compositions of the present invention have<br>
enhanced stability compared to certain amylases, such as Termamyl . Enhanced<br>
stability refers to a significant or measurable improvement in one or more of: oxidative<br>
stability, e.g., to hydrogen peroxide/tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at<br>
pH 9-10; thermal stability, e.g., at common wash temperatures such as about 60 Â°C;<br>
and/or alkaline stability, e.g., at a pH from about 8 to about 11; each compared to a<br>
suitable control amylase, such as TermamylÂ®. Stability can be measured by methods<br>
known to those of skill in the art. Suitable enhanced stability amylases for use in the<br>
compositions of the present invention have a specific activity at least 25% higher than<br>
the specific activity of TermamylÂ® at a temperature in a range of 25 Â°C to 55 Â°C and at a<br>
pH in a range of about 8 to about 10. Amylase activity for such comparisons can be<br>
 <br>
<br>
measured by assays known to those of skill in the art and/or commercially available,<br>
such as the PhadebasÂ® I-amylase assay.<br>
In some embodiments, the amount of commercial amylase present in the<br>
composition of the invention ranges from about 0.1% by weight of detersive solution to<br>
about 3% by weight, preferably about 1% to about 3% by weight, preferably about 2 %<br>
by weight, of solution of the commercial enzyme product. Typical commercially<br>
available detersive enzymes include about 0.25-5% of active amylase.<br>
Whereas establishing the percentage by weight of amylase required is of<br>
practical convenience for manufacturing embodiments of the present teaching, variance<br>
in commercial amylase concentrates and in-situ environmental additive and negative<br>
effects upon amylase activity may require a more discerning analytical technique for<br>
amylase assay to quantify enzyme activity and establish correlations to soil residue<br>
removal performance and to enzyme stability within the embodiment; and, if a<br>
concentrate, to use-dilution solutions. The activity of the amylases for use in the<br>
present invention can be expressed in known units or through known amylase assays<br>
and/or commercially available assays, such as the Phadebas a-amylase assay.<br>
Mixtures of different amylase enzymes can be incorporated into this invention.<br>
While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that<br>
any amylase which can confer the desired amylase activity to the composition can be<br>
used and this embodiment of this invention is not limited in any way by specific choice<br>
of amylase enzyme.<br>
Celluloses<br>
A cellulase suitable for the composition of the present invention can be derived<br>
from a plant, an animal, or a microorganism. The cellulase can be derived from a<br>
microorganism, such as a fungus or a bacterium. Suitable cellulases include those<br>
derived from a fungus, such as Humicola insolens, Humicola strain DSM1800, or a<br>
cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas and those extracted<br>
from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabella Auricula Solander. The<br>
 <br>
<br>
cellulase can be purified or a component of an extract, and either wild type or variant<br>
(either chemical or recombinant).<br>
Examples of cellulase enzymes that can be employed in the composition of the<br>
invention include those sold under the trade names CarezymeÂ® or CelluzymeÂ® by Novo,<br>
or Cellulase by Genencor; and the like. A mixture of cellulases can also be used.<br>
Suitable cellulases are described in patent documents including: U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,435,307, GB-A-2.075.028, GB-A-2.095.275, DE-OS-2.247.832, WO 9117243, and<br>
WO 9414951 A (stabilized cellulases) to Novo.<br>
In some embodiments, the amount of commercial cellulase present in the<br>
composition of the invention ranges from about 0.1% by weight of detersive solution to<br>
about 3% by weight, preferably about 1% to about 3% by weight, of solution of the<br>
commercial enzyme product. Typical commercially available detersive enzymes<br>
include about 5-10 percent of active enzyme.<br>
Whereas establishing the percentage by weight of cellulase required is of<br>
practical convenience for manufacturing embodiments of the present teaching, variance<br>
in commercial cellulase concentrates and in-situ environmental additive and negative<br>
effects upon cellulase activity may require a more discerning analytical technique for<br>
cellulase assay to quantify enzyme activity and establish correlations to soil residue<br>
removal performance and to enzyme stability within the embodiment; and, if a<br>
concentrate, to use-dilution solutions. The activity of the cellulases for use in the<br>
present invention can be expressed in known units or through known or commercially<br>
available cellulase assays.<br>
Mixtures of different cellulase enzymes can be incorporated into this invention.<br>
While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that<br>
any cellulase which can confer the desired cellulase activity to the composition can be<br>
used and this embodiment of this invention is not limited in any way by specific choice<br>
of cellulase enzyme.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Lipases<br>
A lipase suitable for the composition of the present invention can be derived<br>
from a plant, an animal, or a microorganism. In an embodiment, the lipase is derived<br>
from a microorganism, such as a fungus or a bacterium. Suitable lipases include those<br>
derived from a Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC 19.154, or from a<br>
Humicola, such as Humicola lanuginosa (typically produced recombinantly in<br>
Aspergillus oryzae). The lipase can be purified or a component of an extract, and either<br>
wild type or variant (either chemical or recombinant).<br>

invention include those sold under the trade names Lipase P "Amano" or "Amano-P" by<br>
Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan or under the trade name LipolaseÂ® by<br>
Novo, and the like. Other commercially available lipases that can be employed in the<br>
present solid compositions include Amano-CES, lipases derived from Chromobacter<br>
viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRLB 3673 from Toyo Jozo<br>
Co., Tagata, Japan; Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp.,<br>
U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., and lipases derived from Pseudomonas gladioli or from<br>
Humicola lanuginosa.<br>
A suitable lipase is sold under the trade name Lipolase by Novo. Suitable<br>
lipases are described in patent documents including: WO 9414951 A (stabilized lipases)<br>
to Novo, WO 9205249, RD 94359044, GB 1,372,034, Japanese Patent Application<br>
53,20487, laid open Feb. 24, 1978 to Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and EP<br>
341,947.<br>
In an embodiment, the amount of commercial lipase present in the composition<br>
of the invention ranges from about 0.1% by weight of detersive solution to about 3% by<br>
weight, preferably about 1% to about 3% by weight, of solution of the commercial<br>
enzyme product. Typical commercially available detersive enzymes include about 5-10<br>
percent of active enzyme.<br>
Whereas establishing the percentage by weight of lipase required is of practical<br>
convenience for manufacturing embodiments of the present teaching, variance in<br>
 <br>
<br>
commercial lipase concentrates and in-situ environmental additive and negative effects<br>
upon lipase activity may require a more discerning analytical technique for lipase assay<br>
to quantify enzyme activity and establish correlations to soil residue removal<br>
performance and to enzyme stability within the embodiment; and, if a concentrate, to<br>
use-dilution solutions. The activity of the lipases for use in the present invention can be<br>
expressed in known units or through known or commercially available lipase assays.<br>
Mixtures of different lipase enzymes can be incorporated into this invention.<br>
While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that<br>
any lipase which can confer the desired lipase activity to the composition can be used<br>
and this embodiment of this invention is not limited in any way by specific choice of<br>
lipase enzyme.<br>
Additional Enzymes<br>
Additional enzymes suitable for use in the present solid compositions include a<br>
cutinase, a peroxidase, a gluconase, and the like. Suitable cutinase enzymes are<br>
described in WO 8809367 A to Genencor. Known peroxidases include horseradish<br>
peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidases such as chloro- or bromo-peroxidase.<br>
Peroxidases suitable for compositions are disclosed in WO 89099813 A and WO<br>
8909813 A to Novo. Peroxidase enzymes can be used in combination with oxygen<br>
sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, hydrogen peroxide, and the like. Additional<br>
enzymes suitable for incorporation into the present solid composition are disclosed in<br>
WO 9307263 A and WO 9307260 A to Genencor International, WO 8908694 A to<br>
Novo, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,553,139 to McCarty et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,457 to Place<br>
et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,219 to Hughes and U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,868 to Hora et al.<br>
An additional enzyme, such as a cutinase or peroxidase, suitable for the<br>
composition of the present invention can be derived from a plant, an animal, or a<br>
microorganism. Preferably the enzyme is derived from a microorganism. The enzyme<br>
can be purified or a component of an extract, and either wild type or variant (either<br>
chemical or recombinant). In preferred embodiments of this invention, the amount of<br>
 <br>
commercial additional enzyme, such as a cutinase or peroxidase, present in the<br>
composition of the invention ranges from about 0.1% by weight of detersive solution to<br>
about 3% by weight, preferably about 1 % to about 3% by weight, of solution of the<br>
commercial enzyme product. Typical commercially available detersive enzymes<br>
include about 5-10 percent of active enzyme.<br>
Whereas establishing the percentage by weight of additional enzyme, such as a<br>
cutinase or peroxidase, required is of practical convenience for manufacturing<br>
embodiments of the present teaching, variance in commercial additional enzyme<br>
concentrates and in-situ environmental additive and negative effects upon their activity<br>
may require a more discerning analytical technique for the enzyme assay to quantify<br>
enzyme activity and establish correlations to soil residue removal performance and to<br>
enzyme stability within the embodiment; and, if a concentrate, to use-dilution solutions.<br>
The activity of the additional enzyme, such as a cutinase or peroxidase, for use in the<br>
present invention can be expressed in known units or through known or commercially<br>
available assays.<br>
Naturally, mixtures of different additional enzymes can be incorporated into this<br>
invention. While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be<br>
understood that any additional enzyme which can confer the desired enzyme activity to<br>
the composition can be used and this embodiment of this invention is not limited in any<br>
way by specific choice of enzyme.<br>
Enzyme Stabilizing System<br>
The present solid compositions can also include ingredients to stabilize one or<br>
more enzymes. For example, the cleaning composition of the invention can include a<br>
water-soluble source of calcium and/or magnesium ions. Calcium ions are generally<br>
more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation<br>
is being used. Compositions, especially liquids, can include from about 1 to about 30,<br>
preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12<br>
millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished composition, though variation is possible<br>
depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes<br>
 <br>
<br>
incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed,<br>
including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium<br>
malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally,<br>
calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the listed calcium salts may be<br>
used. Further increased levels of calcium and/or magnesium may of course be useful,<br>
for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions, for example warewashing<br>
compositions, may further include from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to<br>
about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach<br>
species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes,<br>
especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small,<br>
typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in<br>
the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during<br>
warewashing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use<br>
can be problematic.<br>
Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and,<br>
if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite,<br>
thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines<br>
such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof,<br>
monoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used. Likewise,<br>
special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have<br>
maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate,<br>
chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium<br>
perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed<br>
phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc.,<br>
and mixtures thereof can be used if desired.<br>
In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by<br>
ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, there is no requirement<br>
to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the<br>
 <br>
<br>
desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even<br>
then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will<br>
exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or<br>
stabilizer which is unacceptably incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive<br>
ingredients. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed<br>
with the composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during<br>
storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle<br>
such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,392, Baginski et al.<br>
Boric Acid Salts<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention relates to a solid cleaning<br>
composition including stable microbial cleaning compositions that employ one or more<br>
boric acid salts to provide improved stability of the microbial preparation, even at basic<br>
pH or in an aqueous concentrate prepared from the solid composition. Suitable boric<br>
acid salts can provide alkalinity. Such salts include alkali metal boric acid salts; amine<br>
boric acid salts, preferably alkanolamine boric acid salts; and the like; or a combination<br>
thereof. In certain embodiments, the boric acid salt includes potassium borate,<br>
monoethanolammonium borate, diethanolammonium borate, triethanolammonium<br>
borate, and the like, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the boric acid salt<br>
includes monoethanolamine borate.<br>
The boric acid salt, e.g. potassium or monoethanolamine borate, can be obtained<br>
by any of a variety of routes. For example, commercially available boric acid salt, e.g.<br>
potassium borate, can be added to the composition. Alternatively, the boric acid salt,<br>
e.g. potassium or monoethanolamine borate, can be obtained by neutralizing boric acid<br>
with a base, e.g. a potassium containing base such as potassium hydroxide or a base<br>
such as monoethanolamine.<br>
In certain embodiments, the boric acid salt is soluble in an aqueous concentrate<br>
prepared from the solid composition at concentrations in excess of 5 or 10 wt-%, e.g., in<br>
excess of 11, 12, 13, 14,15, 16,17, 18, 19, or 20 wt-%. In certain embodiments, the<br>
 <br>
<br>
boric acid salt can be soluble in an aqueous concentrate prepared from the solid<br>
composition at concentrations up to 35 wt-%, e.g., up to 25, 30, or 35 wt-%. In certain<br>
embodiments, the boric acid salt can be soluble at 12-35 wt-%, 15-30 wt-%, or 20-25<br>
wt-%, e.g., 20-25 wt-%. The present solid compositions can also include any of the<br>
quantities or ranges of boric acid salt modified by the term "about".<br>
In some embodiments, alkanol amine borates, such as monoethanolamine<br>
borate, are soluble at concentrations larger than other boric acid salts, particularly<br>
sodium borate. Alkanol amine borates, such as monoethanolamine borate, can be<br>
employed and soluble in an aqueous concentrate prepared from the solid composition at<br>
concentrations listed above, preferably up to about 30 weight percent, preferably about<br>
20 to about 25 weight percent. In an embodiment, this high solubility can be obtained<br>
at alkaline pH, such as pH about 9 to about 10.5.<br>
In some embodiments, potassium borate is soluble at concentrations larger than<br>
other metal boric acid salts, particularly other alkali metal boric acid salts, particularly<br>
sodium borate. Potassium borate can be employed and soluble in an aqueous<br>
concentrate prepared from the solid composition at concentrations listed above,<br>
preferably up to about 25 weight percent, preferably about 15 to about 25 weight<br>
percent. In an embodiment, this high solubility can be obtained at alkaline pH, such as<br>
pH about 9 to about 10.5.<br>
The boric acid salt can provide desirable increases in microbial preparation<br>
stability at basic pH compared to other buffer systems suitable for maintaining a pH<br>
above about 7, above about 8, about 8 to about 11, or about 9 to about 10.5.<br>
Maintaining alkaline pH can provide greater cleaning power.<br>
In an embodiment, the present cleaning composition includes spore, bacteria, or<br>
fungi; and alkanol amine borate. In an embodiment, the composition can include<br>
ingredients that when dissolved as a use composition or concentrate composition<br>
provide a composition with pH greater than or equal to 9, e.g., about 9 to about 10.5. In<br>
an embodiment, the use or concentrate composition can have pH greater than or equal<br>
to 8, e.g., about 8 to about 9.5.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In certain embodiments, the present solid composition includes boric acid salt<br>
(e.g., alkanolamine borate, e.g., monoethanolamine borate or sodium borate) at about 2<br>
wt-% to about 10 wt-%, at about 5 to about 35 wt-%, at about 5 wt-% to about 20 wt-%,<br>
at about 5 wt-% to about 15 wt-%, about 10 wt-% to about 30 wt-%, at about 10 to<br>
about 20 wt-%, or at about 25 wt-% to about 30 wt-%. In certain embodiments, borate<br>
salt is present at about 5 wt-%, at about 10 wt-%, at about 15 wt-%, at about 20 wt-%,<br>
at about 25 wt-%, or at about 30 wt-% of the composition. The present solid<br>
compositions can also include any of the quantities or ranges of monoethanolamine<br>
borate not modified by the term "about".<br>
Additional Ingredients<br>
Solid cleaning compositions made according to the invention may further<br>
include additional functional materials or additives that provide a beneficial property,<br>
for example, to the composition in solid form or when dispersed or dissolved in an<br>
aqueous solution, e.g., for a particular use. Examples of conventional additives include<br>
one or more of each of salt, alkalinity source, surfactant, detersive polymer, cleaning<br>
agent, rinse aid composition, softener, pH modifier, source of acidity, anti-corrosion<br>
agent, secondary hardening agent, solubility modifier, detergent builder, detergent filler,<br>
defoamer, anti-redeposition agent, antimicrobial, rinse aid composition, threshold agent<br>
or system, aesthetic enhancing agent (i.e., dye, odorant, perfume), optical brightener,<br>
lubricant composition, bleaching agent or additional bleaching agent, enzyme,<br>
effervescent agent, activator for the source of alkalinity, other such additives or<br>
functional ingredients, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The present solid product can<br>

Metal Protecting Silicate<br>
An effective amount of an alkaline metal silicate or hydrate thereof can be<br>
employed in the compositions and processes of the invention to form a stable solid<br>
cleaning composition that can have metal protecting capacity. The silicates employed<br>
in the compositions of the invention are those that have conventionally been used in<br>
warewashing formulations. For example, typical alkali metal silicates are those waxy<br>
powdered, particulate or granular silicates which are either anhydrous or preferably<br>
which contain water of hydration (5 to 25 wt%, preferably 15 to 20 wt% water of<br>
hydration). These silicates can be sodium silicates and have a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about<br>
1:1 to about 1:5, respectively, and typically contain available bound water in the<br>
amount of from 5 to about 25 wt%. In general, the silicates of the present invention<br>
have a Na20:Si02 ratio of 1:1 to about 1:3.75, preferably about 1:1.5 to about 1:3.75<br>
and most preferably about 1:1.5 to about 1:2.5. A silicate with a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of<br>
about 1:2 and about 16 to 22 wt% water of hydration is suitable.<br>
For example, such silicates are available in waxy powder form as GD Silicate<br>
and in granular form as Britesil H-20, from PQ Corporation. These ratios may be<br>
obtained with single silicate compositions or combinations of silicates which upon<br>
combination result in the preferred ratio. The hydrated silicates at preferred ratios, a<br>
Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about 1:1.5 to about 1:2.5 have been found to provide the optimum<br>
metal protection and rapidly forming solid block cleaning. The amount of silicate used<br>
in forming the compositions of the invention tend to vary between 10 and 30 wt%,<br>
preferably about 15 to 30 wt% depending on degree of hydration. Hydrated silicates are<br>
preferred.<br>
Suitable silicates for use in the present compositions include sodium silicate,<br>
anhydrous sodium metasilicate, and anhydrous sodium silicate.<br>
Salt<br>
In some embodiments, salts, for example acidic salts, can be included as pH<br>
modifiers, sources of acidity, effervescing aids, or other like uses. Some examples of<br>
 <br>
<br>
salts for use in such applications include sodium bisulfate, sodium acetate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate, citric acid salts, and the like and mixtures thereof. The composition can<br>
include in the range of 0.1 to 50 wt-% such material. It should be understood that<br>
agents other than salts that act as pH modifiers, sources of acidity, effervescing aids, or<br>
like, can also be used in conjunction with the invention.<br>
Exemplary salts for use in the composition include, but are not limited to,<br>
sodium acetate, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate anhydrous, magnesium sulfate<br>
heptahydrate, sodium citrate dehydrate, and magnesium chloride.<br>

also act to form at least a portion of the solidification or binding agent. The active<br>
oxygen compound can be inorganic or organic, and can be a mixture thereof. Some<br>
examples of active oxygen compound include peroxygen compounds, and peroxygen<br>
compound adducts that are suitable for use in forming the binding agent.<br>

presents an example of an inorganic active oxygen compound. Hydrogen peroxide can<br>
be formulated as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water, e.g., as liquid hydrogen<br>
peroxide in an aqueous solution. The mixture of solution can include about 5 to about<br>
40 wt-% hydrogen peroxide or 5 to 50 wt-% hydrogen peroxide.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In an embodiment, the inorganic active oxygen compounds include hydrogen<br>
peroxide adduct. For example, the inorganic active oxygen compounds can include<br>
hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide adduct, or mixtures thereof. Any of a variety of<br>
hydrogen peroxide adducts are suitable for use in the present compositions and<br>
methods. For example, suitable hydrogen peroxide adducts include percarbonate salt,<br>
urea peroxide, peracetyl borate, an adduct of H2O2 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium<br>

oxygen compound can be a peroxycarboxylic acid, such as a mono- or di-<br>
peroxycarboxylic acid, an alkali metal salt including these types of compounds, or an<br>
adduct of such a compound. Suitable peroxycarboxylic acids include C1-C24<br>

the above.<br>
Chelating/Sequestering Agents<br>
Chelating/sequestering agents can be added to the composition and are useful<br>
for their sequestering properties. In general, a chelating/sequestering agent is a<br>
molecule capable of coordinating (i.e., binding) the metal ions commonly found in<br>
natural water to prevent the metal ions from interfering with the action of the other<br>
detersive ingredients of a cleaning composition. The chelating/sequestering agent may<br>
also function as a threshold agent when included in an effective amount. In certain<br>
embodiments, a cleaning composition includes about 0.1-70 wt-% or about 5-60 wt-%,<br>
of a chelating/sequestering agent. Examples of chelating/sequestering agents include<br>

like.<br>
Examples of condensed phosphates include sodium and potassium<br>
orthophosphate, sodium and potassium pyrophosphate, sodium and potassium<br>
 <br>
<br>
tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, and the like. A condensed phosphate<br>
may also assist, to a limited extent, in solidification of the composition by fixing the<br>
free water present in the composition as water of hydration.<br>
Water conditioning polymers can be used as non-phosphorus containing<br>
builders. Suitable water conditioning polymers include, but are not limited to:<br>
polycarboxylates. Suitable polycarboxylates that can be used as builders and/or water<br>
conditioning polymers include, but are not limited to: those having pendant carboxylate<br>
(-CO2-) groups such aspolyacrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic/olefin copolymer,<br>
sulfonated copolymer or terpolymer, acrylic/maleic copolymer, polymethacrylic acid,<br>
acrylic acid-methacrylic acid copolymers, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, hydrolyzed<br>
polymethacrylamide, hydrolyzed polyamide-methacrylamide copolymers, hydrolyzed<br>
polyacrylonitrile, hydrolyzed polymethacrylonitrile, and hydrolyzed acrylonitrile-<br>
methacrylonitrile copolymers. For a further discussion of chelating agents/sequestrants,<br>
see Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, volume 5,<br>
pages 339-366 and volume 23, pages 319-320, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
by reference herein. These materials may also be used at substoichiometric levels to<br>
function as crystal modifiers<br>
In an embodiment, organic sequestrants include amino tri(methylene<br>
phosphonic) acid, l-hydroxyethylidene-l,l-diphosphonic acid,<br>
diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene phosphonic) acid, alanine-N,N-diacetic acid,<br>
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, or alkali metal salts thereof, or mixtures thereof. In<br>
this embodiment, alkali metal salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or<br>
mixtures thereof. The organic sequestrant can include one or more of 1-<br>
hydroxyethylidene-l,l-diphosphonic acid; or diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene<br>
phosphonic) acid; or alanine-N,N-diacetic acid; or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid.<br>
For compositions including a carboxylate as a component of the binding agent,<br>
suitable levels of addition for builders that can also be chelating or sequestering agents<br>
are about 0.1 to about 70 wt-%, about 1 to about 60 wt-%, or about 1.5 to about 50 wt-<br>
%. The solid detergent can include about 1 to about 60 wt-%, about 3 to about 50 wt-<br>
 <br>
%, or about 6 to about 45 wt-% of the builders. Additional ranges of the builders<br>
include about 3 to about 20 wt-%, about 6 to about 15 wt-%, about 25 to about 50 wt-%,<br>
or about 35 to about 45 wt-%.<br>
Glass and Metal Corrosion Inhibitors<br>
The solid cleaning composition can include a metal corrosion inhibitor in an<br>
amount up to about 50 wt-%, about 1 to about 40 wt-%, or about 3 to about 30 wt-%.<br>
The corrosion inhibitor is included in the solid cleaning composition in an amount<br>
sufficient to provide a use solution that exhibits a rate of corrosion and/or etching of<br>
glass that is less than the rate of corrosion and/or etching of glass for an otherwise<br>
identical use solution except for the absence of the corrosion inhibitor. The use solution<br>
will include at least about 6 parts per million (ppm) of the corrosion inhibitor to provide<br>
desired corrosion inhibition properties. Larger amounts of corrosion inhibitor can be<br>
used in the use solution without deleterious effects. However, at a certain point, the<br>
additive effect of increased corrosion and/or etching resistance with increasing<br>
corrosion inhibitor concentration will be lost, and additional corrosion inhibitor will<br>
simply increase the cost of using the solid cleaning composition. The use solution can<br>
include about 6 ppm to about 300 ppm of the corrosion inhibitor or about 20 ppm to<br>
about 200 ppm of the corrosion inhibitor. Examples of suitable corrosion inhibitors<br>
include, but are not limited to: a combination of a source of aluminum ion and a source<br>
of zinc ion, as well as an alkaline metal silicate or hydrate thereof.<br>
The corrosion inhibitor can refer to the combination of a source of aluminum ion<br>
and a source of zinc ion. The source of aluminum ion and the source of zinc ion<br>
provide aluminum ion and zinc ion, respectively, when the solid cleaning composition<br>
is provided in the form of a use solution. The amount of the corrosion inhibitor is<br>
calculated based upon the combined amount of the source of aluminum ion and the<br>
source of zinc ion. Anything that provides an aluminum ion in a use solution can be<br>
referred to as a source of aluminum ion, and anything that provides a zinc ion when<br>
provided in a use solution can be referred to as a source of zinc ion. It is not necessary<br>
 <br>
<br>
for the source of aluminum ion and/or the source of zinc ion to react to form the<br>
aluminum ion and/or the zinc ion. Aluminum ions can be considered a source of<br>
aluminum ion, and zinc ions can be considered a source of zinc ion. The source of<br>
aluminum ion and the source of zinc ion can be provided as organic salts, inorganic<br>
salts, and mixtures thereof. Suitable sources of aluminum ion include, but are not<br>
limited to: aluminum salts such as sodium aluminate, aluminum bromide, aluminum<br>
chlorate, aluminum chloride, aluminum iodide, aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate,<br>
aluminum acetate, aluminum formate, aluminum tartrate, aluminum lactate, aluminum<br>
oleate, aluminum bromate, aluminum borate, aluminum potassium sulfate, aluminum<br>
zinc sulfate, and aluminum phosphate. Suitable sources of zinc ion include, but are not<br>
limited to: zinc salts such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, zinc iodide, zinc<br>
thiocyanate, zinc fluorosilicate, zinc dichromate, zinc chlorate, sodium zincate, zinc<br>
gluconate, zinc acetate, zinc benzoate, zinc citrate, zinc lactate, zinc formate, zinc<br>
bromate, zinc bromide, zinc fluoride, zinc fluorosilicate, and zinc salicylate.<br>
Controlling the ratio of the aluminum ion to the zinc ion in the use solution, it is<br>
possible to provide reduced corrosion and/or etching of glassware and ceramics<br>
compared with the use of either component alone. That is, the combination of the<br>
aluminum ion and the zinc ion can provide a synergy in the reduction of corrosion<br>
and/or etching. The ratio of the source of aluminum ion to the source of zinc ion can be<br>
controlled to provide a synergistic effect. In general, the weight ratio of aluminum ion<br>
to zinc ion in the use solution can be at least about 6:1, can be less than about 1:20, and<br>
can be about 2:1 and about 1:15.<br>
An effective amount of an alkaline metal silicate or hydrate thereof can be<br>
employed in the compositions and processes of the invention to form a stable solid<br>
cleaning composition having metal protecting capacity. The silicates employed in the<br>
compositions of the invention are those that have conventionally been used in solid<br>
cleaning formulations. For example, typical alkali metal silicates are those waxy<br>
powdered, particulate or granular silicates which are either anhydrous or preferably<br>
which contain water of hydration (about 5% to about 25 wt-%, about 15% to about 20<br>
 <br>
<br>
wt-% water of hydration). These silicates are preferably sodium silicates and have a<br>
Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about 1:1 to about 1:5, respectively, and typically contain available<br>
water in the amount of from about 5% to about 25 wt-%. In general, the silicates have a<br>
Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about 1:1 to about 1:3.75, about 1:1.5 to about 1:3.75 and most<br>
about 1:1.5 to about 1:2.5. A silicate with a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about 1:2 and about<br>
16% to about 22 wt-% water of hydration, is most preferred. For example, such<br>
silicates are available in waxy powder form as GD Silicate and in granular form as<br>
Britesil H-20, available from PQ Corporation, Valley Forge, PA. These ratios may be<br>
obtained with single silicate compositions or combinations of silicates which upon<br>
combination result in the preferred ratio. The hydrated silicates at preferred ratios, a<br>
Na2O:SiO2 ratio of about 1:1.5 to about 1:2.5, have been found to provide the optimum<br>
metal protection and rapidly form a solid cleaning agent. Hydrated silicates are<br>
preferred.<br>
Silicates can be included in the solid detergent composition to provide for metal<br>
protection but are additionally known to provide alkalinity and additionally function as<br>
anti-redeposition agents. Suitable silicates include, but are not limited to: sodium<br>
silicate and potassium silicate. The solid cleaning composition can be provided<br>
without silicates, but when silicates are included, they can be included in amounts that<br>
provide for desired metal protection. The composition can include silicates in amounts<br>
of at least about 1 wt-%, at least about 5 wt-%, at least about 10 wt-%, and at least<br>
about 15 wt-%. In addition, in order to provide sufficient room for other components in<br>
the composition, the silicate component can be provided at a level of less than about 35<br>
wt-%, less than about 25 wt-%, less than about 20 wt-%, or less than about 15 wt-%.<br>
Antimicrobial Agent<br>
Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that can be used in a solid<br>
functional material that alone, or in combination with other components, act to reduce<br>
or prevent microbial contamination and deterioration of commercial products material<br>
systems, surfaces, etc. In some aspects, these materials fall in specific classes including<br>
 <br>

compatible with the spore. The antimicrobial agent can be selected to persist for a<br>
shorter time than the spore. After the antimicrobial agent is sufficiently gone, the spore<br>
can germinate to form microbes without the microbe being killed or inhibited by the<br>
antimicrobial agent. For example, a composition including a microbe can include an<br>
antimicrobial agent ineffective against that microbe.<br>
Any of a variety of suitable antimicrobial agents can be employed at effective<br>
antimicrobial concentration. Antimicrobial agents include active oxygen compounds<br>
(e.g., hydrogen peroxide, percarbonate, perborate, and the like), halogen containing<br>

antibacterial agents include sodium trichloroisocyanurate, sodium dichloro isocyanate<br>
(anhydrous or dihydrate), iodine-poly(vinylpyrolidinone) complexes, bromine<br>

agents such as benzalkonium chloride, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride, choline<br>
diiodochloride, tetramethyl phosphonium tribromide. Other antimicrobial compositions<br>
such as hexahydro-1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-triazine, dithiocarbamates such as<br>
sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, and a variety of other materials are known in the art<br>
for their anti-microbial properties. In some embodiments, an antimicrobial component,<br>
such as TAED can be included in the range of 0.001 to 75 wt-% of the composition,<br>
about 0.01 to 20 wt-%, or about 0.05 to about 10 wt-%.<br>

embodiment, the present composition includes a linear alkyl ether diamine compound of<br>
Formula 2 in which R1 is C12-C16, R2 is C3, and R3 is C3. In an embodiment, R1 is<br>
either a linear alkyl C12-C16 or a mixture of linear alkyl C10 -C12 and C14 -C16. Suitable<br>
ether amines are commercially available from Tomah Products Incorporated as PA-19,<br>

thereof. Such N-alkyl-1,3-propylene diamines are available from Akzo Chemie<br>
America, Armak Chemicals under the trademark Duomeen.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The amount of the amine compound in the composition can be about 0.1 wt-%<br>
to 90 wt-%, about 0.25 wt-% to 75 wt-%, or about 0.5 wt-% to 50 wt-%. The amount of<br>
the amine compound in use compositions can be about 10 ppm to 10000 ppm, about 20<br>
ppm to 7500 ppm, and about 40 ppm to 5000 ppm.<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition can provide greater than 3 logio<br>
reduction of bacteria within a 5 minute contact time. In an embodiment, the present<br>
composition can provide in excess of 5 log10 reduction of microorganisms. This can be<br>
advantageous in food preparation and food processing and other areas where<br>
triglyceride fats and lipids are soil components.<br>
In certain embodiments, the antimicrobial agent can be at about 0.01 to about 30<br>
wt-% of the composition, 0.05 to about 10 wt-%, or about 0.1 to about 5 wt-%. In a use<br>
solution the additional antimicrobial agent can be about 0.001 to about 5 wt-% of the<br>
composition, about 0.01 to about 2 wt-%, or about 0.05 to about 0.5 wt-%.<br>
Activators<br>
In some embodiments, the antimicrobial activity or bleaching activity of the<br>
composition can be enhanced by the addition of a material which, when the<br>
composition is placed in use, reacts with the active oxygen to form an activated<br>
component. For example, in some embodiments, a peracid or a peracid salt is formed.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, tetraacetylethylene diamine can be included within<br>
the composition to react with the active oxygen and form a peracid or a peracid salt that<br>
acts as an antimicrobial agent. Other examples of active oxygen activators include<br>
transition metals and their compounds, compounds that contain a carboxylic, nitrile, or<br>
ester moiety, or other such compounds known in the art. In an embodiment, the<br>
activator includes tetraacetylethylene diamine; transition metal; compound that includes<br>
carboxylic, nitrile, amine, or ester moiety; or mixtures thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, an activator component can include in the range of 0.001<br>
to 75 % by wt. of the composition, about 0.01 to about 20, or about 0.05 to about 10%<br>
by wt of the composition.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In other embodiments, the activator for the source of alkalinity combines with<br>
the active oxygen to form an antimicrobial agent.<br>
The solid composition typically remains stable even in the presence of activator<br>
of the source of alkalinity. In many compositions would be expected to react with and<br>
destabilize or change the form of the source of alkalinity. In contrast, in an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the composition remains solid; it does not swell, crack, or<br>
enlarge as it would if the source of alkalinity were reacting with the activator.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition includes a solid block, and an activator<br>
material for the active oxygen is coupled to the solid block. The activator can be<br>
coupled to the solid block by any of a variety of methods for coupling one solid<br>
cleaning composition to another. For example, the activator can be in the form of a<br>
solid that is bound, affixed, glued or otherwise adhered to the solid block.<br>
Alternatively, the solid activator can be formed around and encasing the block. By way<br>
of further example, the solid activator can be coupled to the solid block by the container<br>
or package for the cleaning composition, such as by a plastic or shrink wrap or film.<br>
Rinse Aid Functional Materials<br>
Functional materials for use in the compositions of the invention can include a<br>
formulated rinse aid composition containing a wetting or sheeting agent combined with<br>
other optional ingredients in a solid made using the complex of the invention. The rinse<br>
aid component of the present invention can include a water soluble or dispersible low<br>
foaming organic material capable of reducing the surface tension of the rinse water to<br>
promote sheeting action and to prevent spotting or streaking caused by beaded water<br>
after rinsing is completed. This is often used in warewashing processes. Such sheeting<br>
agents are typically organic surfactant-like materials having a characteristic cloud point.<br>
The cloud point of the surfactant rinse or sheeting agent is defined as the temperature at<br>
which a 1 wt-% aqueous solution of the surfactant turns cloudy when warmed.<br>
There are two general types of rinse cycles in commercial warewashing<br>
machines, a first type generally considered a sanitizing rinse cycle uses rinse water at a<br>
 <br>
<br>
temperature of about 180Â°F, about 80Â°C or higher. A second type of non-sanitizing<br>
machines uses a lower temperature non-sanitizing rinse, typically at a temperature of<br>
about 125Â°F, about 50Â°C or higher. Surfactants useful in these applications are aqueous<br>
rinses having a cloud point greater than the available hot service water. Accordingly,<br>
the lowest useful cloud point measured for the surfactants of the invention is<br>
approximately 40Â°C. The cloud point can also be 60Â°C or higher, 70Â°C or higher, 80Â°C<br>
or higher, etc., depending on the use locus hot water temperature and the temperature<br>
and type of rinse cycle.<br>
Suitable sheeting agents, typically include a polyether compound prepared from<br>
ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or a mixture in a homopolymer or block or heteric<br>
copolymer structure. Such polyether compounds are known as polyalkylene oxide<br>
polymers, polyoxyalkylene polymers or polyalkylene glycol polymers. Such sheeting<br>
agents require a region of relative hydrophobicity and a region of relative hydrophilicity<br>
to provide surfactant properties to the molecule. Such sheeting agents have a molecular<br>
weight in the range of about 500 to 15,000. Certain types of (PO)(EO) polymeric rinse<br>
aids have been found to be useful containing at least one block of poly(PO) and at least<br>
one block of poly(EO) in the polymer molecule. Additional blocks of poly(EO), poly<br>
PO or random polymerized regions can be formed in the molecule.<br>
Particularly useful polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymers are<br>
those including a center block of polyoxypropylene units and blocks of polyoxyethylene<br>
units to each side of the center block. Such polymers have the formula shown below:<br>
(EO)n-(PO)m-(EO)n<br>
wherein n is an integer of 20 to 60, each end is independently an integer of 10 to 130.<br>
Another useful block copolymer are block copolymers having a center block of<br>
polyoxyethylene units and blocks of polyoxypropylene to each side of the center block.<br>
Such copolymers have the formula:<br>
(PO)n-(EO)m-(PO)n<br>
wherein m is an integer of 15 to 175 and each end arc independently integers of about<br>
10 to 30. The solid functional materials of the invention can often use a hydrotrope to<br>
 <br>
<br>
aid in maintaining the solubility of sheeting or wetting agents. Hydrotropes can be used<br>
to modify the aqueous solution creating increased solubility for the organic material.<br>
Suitable hydrotropes are low molecular weight aromatic sulfonate materials such as<br>
xylene sulfonates and dialkyldiphenyl oxide sulfonate materials.<br>
In some embodiments, compositions according to the present invention provide<br>
desirable rinsing properties in ware washing without employing a separate rinse agent<br>
in the rinse cycle. For example, good rinsing occurs using such compositions in the<br>
wash cycle when rinsing employs just soft water.<br>
Additional Bleaching Agents<br>
Additional bleaching agents for use in inventive formulations for lightening or<br>
whitening a substrate, include bleaching compounds capable of liberating an active<br>
halogen species, such as Cl2, Br2,I2, ClO2, BrO2,IO2, -OCl-, -OBr- and/or, -OI-, under<br>
conditions typically encountered during the cleansing process. Suitable bleaching<br>
agents for use in the present cleaning compositions include, for example, chlorine-<br>
containing compounds such as a chlorite, a hypochlorite, chloramine. Suitable halogen-<br>
releasing compounds include the alkali metal dichloroisocyanurates, chlorinated<br>
trisodium phosphate, the alkali metal hypochlorites, alkali metal chlorites,<br>
monochloramine and dichloramine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Encapsulated<br>
chlorine sources may also be used to enhance the stability of the chlorine source in the<br>
composition (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,618,914 and 4,830,773, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein). A bleaching agent may also<br>
be an additional peroxygen or active oxygen source such as hydrogen peroxide,<br>
perborates, for example sodium perborate mono and tetrahydrate, sodium carbonate<br>
peroxyhydrate, phosphate peroxyhydrates, and potassium permonosulfate, with and<br>
without activators such as tetraacetylethylene diamine, and the like, as discussed above.<br>
A cleaning composition may include a minor but effective additional amount of<br>
a bleaching agent above that already available from the stabilized source of alkalinity,<br>
e.g., about 0.1-10 wt-% or about 1-6 wt-%. The present solid compositions can include<br>
 <br>
<br>
bleaching agent in an amount of about 0.1 to about 60 wt-%, about 1 to about 20 wt-%,<br>
about 3 to about 8 wt-%, or about 3 to about 6 wt-%.<br>
Secondary Hardening Agents/Solubility Modifiers.<br>
The present compositions may include a minor but effective amount of a<br>
secondary hardening agent, as for example, an amide such stearic monoethanolamide or<br>
lauric diethanolamide, or an alkylamide, and the like; a solid polyethylene glycol, or a<br>
solid EO/PO block copolymer, and the like; starches that have been made water-soluble<br>
through an acid or alkaline treatment process; various inorganics that impart solidifying<br>
properties to a heated composition upon cooling, and the like. Such compounds may<br>
also vary the solubility of the composition in an aqueous medium during use such that<br>
the cleaning agent and/or other active ingredients may be dispensed from the solid<br>
composition over an extended period of time. The composition may include a<br>
secondary hardening agent in an amount of about 5-20 wt-% or about 10-15 wt-%.<br>
Detergent Fillers<br>
A cleaning composition may include an effective amount of one or more of a<br>
detergent filler which does not perform as a cleaning agent per se, but cooperates with<br>
the cleaning agent to enhance the overall processability of the composition. Examples<br>
of fillers suitable for use in the present cleaning compositions include sodium sulfate,<br>
sodium chloride, starch, sugars, C1-C10 alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, and<br>
the like. A filler such as a sugar (e.g. sucrose) can aid dissolution of a solid<br>
composition by acting as a disintegrant. A detergent filler can be included in an amount<br>
up to about 50 wt-%, of about 1 to about 20 wt-%, about 3 to about 15 wt-%, about 1 to<br>
about 30 wt-%, or about 1.5 to about 25 wt-%.<br>
Defoaming Agents<br>
An effective amount of a defoaming agent for reducing the stability of foam may<br>
also be included in the present cleaning compositions. The cleaning composition can<br>
 <br>
<br>
include about 0.0001-5 wt-% of a defoaming agent, e.g., about 0.01-3 wt-%. The<br>
defoaming agent can be provided in an amount of about 0.0001% to about 10 wt-%,<br>
about 0.001% to about 5 wt-%, or about 0.01% to about 1.0 wt-%.<br>
Examples of defoaming agents suitable for use in the present compositions<br>
include silicone compounds such as silica dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane, EO/PO<br>
block copolymers, alcohol alkoxylates, fatty amides, hydrocarbon waxes, fatty acids,<br>
fatty esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid soaps, ethoxylates, mineral oils, polyethylene<br>
glycol esters, alkyl phosphate esters such as monostearyl phosphate, and the like. A<br>
discussion of defoaming agents may be found, for example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,048,548 to Martin et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,334,147 to Bruneile et al., and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,442,242 to Rue et al,, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
Anti-redeposition Agents<br>
A cleaning composition may also include an anti-redeposition agent capable of<br>
facilitating sustained suspension of soils in a cleaning solution and preventing the<br>
removed soils from being redeposited onto the substrate being cleaned. Examples of<br>
suitable anti-redeposition agents include fatty acid amides, fluorocarbon surfactants,<br>
complex phosphate esters, styrene maleic anhydride copolymers, and cellulosic<br>
derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and the like. A<br>
cleaning composition may include about 0.5 to about 10 wt-%, e.g., about 1 to about<br>
5 wt-%, of an anti-redeposition agent.<br>
Optical Brighteners<br>
Optical brightener is also referred to as fluorescent whitening agents or<br>
fluorescent brightening agents provide optical compensation for the yellow cast in<br>
fabric substrates. With optical brighteners yellowing is replaced by light emitted from<br>
optical brighteners present in the area commensurate in scope with yellow color. The<br>
violet to blue light supplied by the optical brighteners combines with other light<br>
 <br>
<br>
reflected from the location to provide a substantially complete or enhanced bright white<br>
appearance. This additional light is produced by the brightener through fluorescence.<br>
Optical brighteners absorb light in the ultraviolet range 275 through 400 nm. and emit<br>
light in the ultraviolet blue spectrum 400-500 nm.<br>
Fluorescent compounds belonging to the optical brightener family are typically<br>
aromatic or aromatic heterocyclic materials often containing condensed ring system.<br>
An important feature of these compounds is the presence of an uninterrupted chain of<br>
conjugated double bonds associated with an aromatic ring. The number of such<br>
conjugated double bonds is dependent on substituents as well as the planarity of the<br>
fluorescent part of the molecule. Most brightener compounds are derivatives of stilbene<br>
or 4,4'-diamino stilbene, biphenyl, five membered heterocycles (triazoles, oxazoles,<br>
imidazoles, etc.) or six membered heterocycles (cumarins, naphthalamides, triazines,<br>
etc.). The choice of optical brighteners for use in cleaning compositions will depend<br>
upon a number of factors, such as the type of detergent, the nature of other components<br>
present in the cleaning composition, the temperature of the wash water, the degree of<br>
agitation, and the ratio of the material washed to the tub size. The brightener selection<br>
is also dependent upon the type of material to be cleaned, e.g., cottons, synthetics, etc.<br>
Since most laundry cleaning products are used to clean a variety of fabrics, the cleaning<br>
compositions should contain a mixture of brighteners which are effective for a variety<br>
of fabrics. It is of course necessary that the individual components of such a brightener<br>
mixture be compatible.<br>
Optical brighteners useful in the present invention are commercially available<br>
and will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Commercial optical brighteners<br>
which may be useful in the present invention can be classified into subgroups, which<br>
include, but are not necessarily limited to, derivatives of stilbene, pyrazoline, coumarin,<br>
carboxylic acid, methinecyanines, dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide, azoles, 5- and 6-<br>
membered-ring heterocycles and other miscellaneous agents. Examples of these types<br>
of brighteners are disclosed in "The Production and Application of Fluorescent<br>
 <br>
Brightening Agents", M. Zahradnik, Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York<br>
(1982), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Stilbene derivatives which may be useful in the present invention include, but<br>
are not necessarily limited to, derivatives of bis(triazinyl)amino-stilbene; bisacylamino<br>
derivatives of stilbene; triazole derivatives of stilbene; oxadiazole derivatives of<br>
stilbene; oxazole derivatives of stilbene; and styryl derivatives of stilbene.<br>
For laundry cleaning or sanitizing compositions, suitable optical brighteners<br>
include stilbene derivatives, which can be employed at concentrations of up to 1 wt-%.<br>
Stabilizing Agents<br>
The solid cleaning composition may also include a stabilizing agent. Examples<br>
of suitable stabilizing agents include, but are not limited to: borate, calcium/magnesium<br>
ions, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. The composition need not include a<br>
stabilizing agent, but when the composition includes a stabilizing agent, it can be<br>
included in an amount that provides the desired level of stability of the composition.<br>
Suitable ranges of the stabilizing agent include up to about 20 wt-%, about 0.5 to about<br>
15 wt-%, or about 2 to about 10 wt-%.<br>
Dispersants<br>
The solid cleaning composition may also include a dispersant. Examples of<br>
suitable dispersants that can be used in the solid cleaning composition include, but are<br>
not limited to: maleic acid/olefin copolymers, polyacrylic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The composition need not include a dispersant, but when a dispersant is included it can<br>
be included in an amount that provides the desired dispersant properties. Suitable<br>
ranges of the dispersant in the composition can be up to about 20 wt-%, about 0.5 to<br>
about 15 wt-%, or about 2 to about 9 wt-%.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Thickeners<br>
The solid cleaning compositions can include a rheology modifier or a thickener.<br>
The rheology modifier may provide the following functions: increasing the viscosity of<br>
the compositions; increasing the particle size of liquid use solutions when dispensed<br>
through a spray nozzle; providing the use solutions with vertical cling to surfaces;<br>
providing particle suspension within the use solutions; or reducing the evaporation rate<br>
of the use solutions.<br>
The rheology modifier may provide a use composition that is pseudo plastic, in<br>
other words the use composition or material when left undisturbed (in a shear mode),<br>
retains a high viscosity. However, when sheared, the viscosity of the material is<br>
substantially but reversibly reduced. After the shear action is removed, the viscosity<br>
returns. These properties permit the application of the material through a spray head.<br>
When sprayed through a nozzle, the material undergoes shear as it is drawn up a feed<br>
tube into a spray head under the influence of pressure and is sheared by the action of a<br>
pump in a pump action sprayer. In either case, the viscosity can drop to a point such<br>
that substantial quantities of the material can be applied using the spray devices used to<br>
apply the material to a soiled surface. However, once the material comes to rest on a<br>
soiled surface, the materials can regain high viscosity to ensure that the material<br>
remains in place on the soil. Preferably, the material can be applied to a surface<br>
resulting in a substantial coating of the material that provides the cleaning components<br>
in sufficient concentration to result in lifting and removal of the hardened or baked-on<br>
soil. While in contact with the soil on vertical or inclined surfaces, the thickeners in<br>
conjunction with the other components of the cleaner minimize dripping, sagging,<br>
slumping or other movement of the material under the effects of gravity. The material<br>
should be formulated such that the viscosity of the material is adequate to maintain<br>
contact substantial quantities of the film of the material with the soil for at least a<br>
minute, five minutes or more.<br>
Examples of suitable thickeners or rheology modifiers are polymeric thickeners<br>
including, but not limited to: polymers or natural polymers or gums derived from plant<br>
 <br>
<br>
or animal sources. Such materials may be polysaccharides such as large polysaccharide<br>
molecules having substantial thickening capacity. Thickeners or rheology modifiers<br>
also include clays.<br>
A substantially soluble polymeric thickener can be used to provide increased<br>
viscosity or increased conductivity to the use compositions. Examples of polymeric<br>
thickeners for the aqueous compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
carboxylated vinyl polymers such as polyacrylic acids and sodium salts thereof,<br>
ethoxylated cellulose, polyacrylamide thickeners, cross-linked, xanthan compositions,<br>
sodium alginate and algin products, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>
and other similar aqueous thickeners that have some substantial proportion of water<br>
solubility. Examples of suitable commercially available thickeners include, but are not<br>
limited to: Acusol, available from Rohm &amp; Haas Company, Philadelphia, PA; and<br>
Carbopol, available from B.F. Goodrich, Charlotte, NC.<br>
Examples of suitable polymeric thickeners include, but not limited to:<br>
polysaccharides. An example of a suitable commercially available polysaccharide<br>
includes, but is not limited to, Diutan, available from Kelco Division of Merck, San<br>
Diego, CA. Thickeners for use in the solid cleaning compositions further include<br>
polyvinyl alcohol thickeners, such as, fully hydrolyzed (greater than 98.5 mol acetate<br>
replaced with the -OH function).<br>
An example of a suitable polysaccharide includes, but is not limited to,<br>
xanthans. Such xanthan polymers are preferred due to their high water solubility, and<br>
great thickening power. Xanthan is an extracellular polysaccharide of Xanthomonas<br>
campestras. Xanthan may be made by fermentation based on corn sugar or other corn<br>
sweetener by-products. Xanthan includes a poly beta-(1-4)-D-Glucopyranosyl<br>
backbone chain, similar to that found in cellulose. Aqueous dispersions of xanthan gum<br>
and its derivatives exhibit novel and remarkable rheological properties. Low<br>
concentrations of the gum have relatively high viscosities which permit it to be used<br>
economically. Xanthan gum solutions exhibit high pseudo plasticity, i.e. over a wide<br>
range of concentrations, rapid shear thinning occurs that is generally understood to be<br>
 <br>
instantaneously reversible. Non-sheared materials have viscosities that appear to be<br>
independent of the pH and independent of temperature over wide ranges. Preferred<br>
xanthan materials include crosslinked xanthan materials. Xanthan polymers can be<br>
crosslinked with a variety of known covalent reacting crosslinking agents reactive with<br>
the hydroxyl functionality of large polysaccharide molecules and can also be<br>
crosslinked using divalent, trivalent or polyvalent metal ions. Such crosslinked xanthan<br>
gels are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,782,901, which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Suitable crosslinking agents for xanthan materials include, but are not<br>
limited to: metal cations such as A1+3, Fe+3, Sb+3, Zr+4 and other transition metals.<br>
Examples of suitable commercially available xanthans include, but are not limited to:<br>
KELTROLÂ®, KELZANÂ® AR, KELZANÂ® D35, KELZANÂ® S, KELZANÂ® XZ,<br>
available from Kelco Division of Merck, San Diego, CA. Known organic crosslinking<br>
agents can also be used. A preferred crosslinked xanthan is KELZANÂ® AR, which<br>
provides a pseudo plastic use solution that can produce large particle size mist or<br>
aerosol when sprayed.<br>
Dves/Odorants<br>
Various dyes, odorants including perfumes, and other aesthetic enhancing agents<br>
may also be included in the composition. Dyes may be included to alter the appearance<br>
of the composition, as for example, Direct Blue 86 (Miles), Fastusol Blue (Mobay<br>
Chemical Corp.), Acid Orange 7 (American Cyanamid), Basic Violet 10 (Sandoz), Acid<br>
Yellow 23 (GAF), Acid Yellow 17 (Sigma Chemical), Sap Green (Keyston Analine and<br>
Chemical), Metanil Yellow (Keystone Analine and Chemical), Acid Blue 9 (Hilton<br>
Davis), Sandolan Blue/Acid Blue 182 (Sandoz), Hisol Fast Red (Capitol Color and<br>
Chemical), Fluorescein (Capitol Color and Chemical), Acid Green 25 (Ciba-Geigy),<br>
and the like.<br>
Fragrances or perfumes that may be included in the compositions include, for<br>
example, terpenoids such as citronellol, aldehydes such as amyl cinnamaldehyde, a<br>
jasmine such as CIS-jasmine or jasmal, vanillin, and the like.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Surfactants<br>
The cleaning compositions of the invention can include a surfactant or surfactant<br>
admixture. Surfactants suitable for use in the compositions can be selected from water<br>
soluble or water dispersible nonionic, semi-polar nonionic, anionic, cationic,<br>
amphoteric, or zwitterionic surface-active agents; or any combination thereof. The<br>
particular surfactant or surfactant mixture chosen for use in the process and products of<br>
this invention can depend on the conditions of final utility, including method of<br>
manufacture, physical product form, use pH, use temperature, foam control, and soil<br>
type.<br>
Surfactants incorporated into the cleaning compositions of the present invention<br>
can be enzyme compatible, not substrates for enzymes in the composition, and not<br>
inhibitors or inactivators of any enzyme present. For example, when proteases and<br>
amylases are employed in the present solid compositions, the surfactant is preferably<br>
free of peptide and glycosidic bonds. In addition, certain cationic surfactants are known<br>
to decrease enzyme effectiveness.<br>
Generally, the concentration of surfactant or surfactant mixture useful in<br>
cleaning compositions of the present invention fall in the range of from about 0.5% to<br>
about 40% by weight of the composition, preferably about 2% to about 10%, preferably<br>
about 5% to about 8%. These percentages can refer to percentages of the commercially<br>
available surfactant composition, which can contain solvents, dyes, odorants, and the<br>
like in addition to the actual surfactant. In this case, the percentage of the actual<br>
surfactant chemical can be less than the percentages listed. These percentages can refer<br>
to the percentage of the actual surfactant chemical.<br>
Anionic Surfactants<br>
Also useful in the present invention are surface active substances which are<br>
categorized as anionics because the charge on the hydrophobe is negative; or surfactants<br>
in which the hydrophobic section of the molecule carries no charge unless the pH is<br>
 <br>
elevated to neutrality or above (e.g. carboxylic acids). Carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate<br>
and phosphate are the polar (hydrophilic) solubilizing groups found in anionic<br>
surfactants. Of the cations (counter ions) associated with these polar groups, sodium,<br>
lithium and potassium impart water solubility; ammonium and substituted ammonium<br>
ions provide both water and oil solubility; and, calcium, barium, and magnesium<br>
promote oil solubility.<br>
Anionics are excellent detersive surfactants and are therefore, favored additions<br>
to heavy duty cleaning compositions. Generally, however, anionics have high foam<br>
profiles which limit their use alone or at high concentration levels in cleaning systems<br>
such as CIP circuits that require strict foam control. Further, anionic surface active<br>
compounds can impart special chemical or physical properties other than detergency<br>
within the composition. Anionics can be employed as gelling agents or as part of a<br>
gelling or thickening system. Anionics are excellent solubilizers and can be used for<br>
hydrotropic effect and cloud point control.<br>
The majority of large volume commercial anionic surfactants can be subdivided<br>
into five major chemical classes and additional sub-groups, which are described in<br>
"Surfactant Encyclopedia", Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries. Vol. 104 (2) 71-86 (1989). The<br>
first class includes acylamino acids (and salts), such as acylgluamates, acyl peptides,<br>
sarcosinates (e.g. N-acyl sarcosinates), taurates (e.g. N-acyl taurates and fatty acid<br>
amides of methyl tauride), and the like. The second class includes carboxylic acids<br>
(and salts), such as alkanoic acids (and alkanoates), ester carboxylic acids (e.g. alkyl<br>
succinates), ether carboxylic acids, and the like. The third class includes phosphoric<br>
acid esters and their salts. The fourth class includes sulfonic acids (and salts), such as<br>
isethionates (e.g. acyl isethionates), alkylaryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates,<br>
sulfosuccinates (e.g. monoesters and diesters of sulfosuccinate), and the like. The fifth<br>
class includes sulfuric acid esters (and salts), such as alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl sulfates,<br>
and the like. Although each of these classes of anionic surfactants can be employed in<br>
the present solid compositions, it should be noted that certain of these anionic<br>
surfactants may be incompatible with the enzymes. For example, the acyl-amino acids<br>
 <br>
and salts may be incompatible with proteolytic enzymes because of their peptide<br>
structure.<br>
Anionic sulfate surfactants suitable for use in the present solid compositions<br>
include the linear and branched primary and secondary alkyl sulfates, alkyl<br>
ethoxysulfates, fatty oleyl glycerol sulfates, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulfates,<br>
the C5 -C17 acyl-N-(C1 -C4 alkyl) and -N-(C1 -C2 hydroxyalkyl) glucamine sulfates, and<br>
sulfates of alkylpolysaccharides such as the sulfates of alkylpolyglucoside (the nonionic<br>
nonsulfated compounds being described herein).<br>
Examples of suitable synthetic, water soluble anionic detergent compounds<br>
include the ammonium and substituted ammonium (such as mono-, di- and<br>
triethanolamine) and alkali metal (such as sodium, lithium and potassium) salts of the<br>
alkyl mononuclear aromatic sulfonates such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates containing<br>
from about 5 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group in a straight or branched<br>
chain, e.g., the salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates or of alkyl toluene, xylene, cumene and<br>
phenol sulfonates; alkyl naphthalene sulfonate, diamyl naphthalene sulfonate, and<br>
dinonyl naphthalene sulfonate and alkoxylated derivatives.<br>
Anionic carboxylate surfactants suitable for use in the present solid<br>
compositions include the alkyl ethoxy carboxylates, the alkyl polyethoxy<br>
polycarboxylate surfactants and the soaps (e.g. alkyl carboxyls). Secondary soap<br>
surfactants (e.g. alkyl carboxyl surfactants) useful in the present solid compositions<br>
include those which contain a carboxyl unit connected to a secondary carbon. The<br>
secondary carbon can be in a ring structure, e.g. as in p-octyl benzoic acid, or as in<br>
alkyl-substituted cyclohexyl carboxylates. The secondary soap surfactants typically<br>
contain no ether linkages, no ester linkages and no hydroxyl groups. Further, they<br>
typically lack nitrogen atoms in the head-group (amphiphilic portion). Suitable<br>
secondary soap surfactants typically contain 11-13 total carbon atoms, although more<br>
carbons atoms (e.g., up to 16) can be present.<br>
Other anionic detergents suitable for use in the present solid compositions<br>
include olefin sulfonates, such as long chain alkene sulfonates, long chain<br>
 <br>
<br>
hydroxyalkane sulfonates or mixtures of alkenesulfonates and hydroxyalkane-<br>
sulfonates. Also included are the alkyl sulfates, alkyl poly(ethyleneoxy) ether sulfates<br>
and aromatic poly(ethyleneoxy) sulfates such as the sulfates or condensation products<br>
of ethylene oxide and nonyl phenol (usually having 1 to 6 oxyethylene groups per<br>
molecule. Resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids are also suitable, such as rosin,<br>
hydrogenated rosin, and resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids present in or derived<br>
from tallow oil.<br>
The particular salts will be suitably selected depending upon the particular<br>
formulation and the needs therein.<br>
Further examples of suitable anionic surfactants are given in "Surface Active<br>
Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). A variety of such<br>
surfactants are also generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678, issued Dec. 30,1975<br>
to Laughlin, et al. at Column 23, line 58 through Column 29, line 23.<br>
In some embodiments, the present solid composition includes alkyl or alkyl aryl<br>
sulfonates or substituted sulfates and sulfated products. In certain embodiments, the<br>

sulfonates, alphaolefln sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, secondary alkane sulfates or<br>
sulfonates, or sulfosuccinates.<br>
In certain embodiments, the composition can include about 0.003 to about 35<br>
wt-% anionic surfactant, for example, about 5 to about 30 wt-% anionic surfactant. The<br>
anionic surfactant can include linear alkyl benzene sulfonate; alpha olefin sulfonate;<br>
alkyl sulfate; secondary alkane sulfonate; sulfosuccinate; or mixtures thereof. The<br>
anionic surfactant can include alkanol ammonium alkyl benzene sulfonate. The anionic<br>
surfactant can include monoethanol ammonium alkyl benzene sulfonate.<br>
Nonionic Surfactant<br>
Nonionic surfactants useful in the invention are generally characterized by the<br>
presence of an organic hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are<br>
typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic, alkyl aromatic or<br>
 <br>
<br>
polyoxyalkylene hydrophobic compound with a hydrophilic alkaline oxide moiety<br>
which in common practice is ethylene oxide or a polyhydration product thereof,<br>
polyethylene glycol. Practically any hydrophobic compound having a hydroxyl,<br>
carboxyl, amino, or amido group with a reactive hydrogen atom can be condensed with<br>
ethylene oxide, or its polyhydration adducts, or its mixtures with alkoxylenes such as<br>
propylene oxide to form a nonionic surface-active agent. The length of the hydrophilic<br>
polyoxyalkylene moiety which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic compound<br>
can be readily adjusted to yield a water dispersible or water soluble compound having<br>
the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.<br>
In an embodiment, the present cleaning composition includes solidification<br>
agent; spore, bacteria or fungus; and boric acid salt, e.g., alkanol amine borate. In<br>
certain embodiments, the composition can also include about 0.003 to about 35 wt-%<br>
nonionic surfactant, for example, about 5 to about 20 wt-% nonionic surfactant. The<br>
nonionic surfactant can include noniomc block copolymer comprising of at least<br>
(EO)y(PO)z, wherein y and z are independently between 2 and 100; C6-24 alkyl phenol<br>
alkoxylate having 2 to 15 moles of ethylene oxide; C6-24 alcohol alkoxylate having 2 to<br>
15 moles of ethylene oxide; alkoxylated amine having 2-20 moles of ethylene oxide; or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
EO/PO Nonionic Surfactant<br>
An example of useful nonionic surfactants used with the silicone surfactants are<br>
polyether compounds prepared from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, in a graft moiety<br>
homopolymer or a block or heteric copolymer. Such polyether compounds are known<br>
as polyalkylene oxide polymers, polyoxyalkylene polymers, or polyalkylene glycol<br>
polymers. Such nonionic surfactants have a molecular weight in the range of about 500<br>
to about 15,000. Certain types of polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene glycol polymer<br>
nonionic surfactants have been found to be particularly useful. Surfactants including at<br>
least one block of a polyoxypropylene and having at least one other block of<br>
polyoxyethylene attached to the polyoxypropylene block can be used. Additional<br>
 <br>
blocks of polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene can be present in a molecule. These<br>
materials having an average molecular weight in the range of about 500 to about 15,000<br>
are commonly available as PLURONICÂ® manufactured by the BASF Corporation and<br>
available under a variety of other trademarks of their chemical suppliers. In addition<br>
<br>
PLURONICÂ® R (reverse PLURONIC structure) are also useful in the compositions of<br>
the invention. Additionally, alkylene oxide groups used with an alcohol and an alkyl<br>
phenol, a fatty acid or other such group can be useful. A useful surfactant can include a<br>
capped polyalkoxylated C6-24 linear alcohol. The surfactants can be made with<br>
polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene units and can be capped with common agents<br>
forming an ether end group. A useful species of this surfactant is a (PO)x compound or<br>
benzyl ether compound polyethoxylated C12-14 linear alcohol; see U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,444,247. Particularly useful polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block polymers are<br>
those including a center block of polyoxypropylene units and blocks of polyoxyethylene<br>
units to each side of the center block.<br>
These copolymers have the formula shown below:<br>
 <br>
wherein m is an integer of 21 to 54; n is an integer of 7 to 128. Additional useful block<br>
copolymers are block polymers having a center block of polyoxyethylene units and<br>
blocks of polyoxypropylene units to each side of the center block. The copolymers<br>
have the formula as shown below:<br>

phenol ethoxylate having 2.5 to 14.5 moles of EO in the ethoxylate group. The<br>
ethoxylate group can be capped with a (PO)x group when x is 2.5 to 12.5 or a benzyl<br>
moiety.<br>

glycol esters, other alkanoic acid esters formed by reaction with glycerides, glycerin,<br>
and polyhydric (saccharide or sorbitan/sorbitol) alcohols have application in this<br>

All of these ester moieties have one or more reactive hydrogen sites on their molecule<br>
which can undergo further acylation or ethylene oxide (alkoxide) addition to control the<br>
hydrophilicity of these substances. Care must be exercised when adding these fatty<br>
ester or acylated carbohydrates to compositions of the present invention containing<br>
amylase and/or lipase enzymes because of potential incompatibility.<br>
Examples of nonionic low foaming surfactants include nonionic surfactants<br>
described above that are modified by "capping" or "end blocking" the terminal hydroxy<br>

and, short chain fatty acids, alcohols or alkyl halides containing from 1 to about 5<br>
carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Also included are reactants such as thionyl<br>
chloride which convert terminal hydroxy groups to a chloride group. Such<br>
modifications to the terminal hydroxy group may lead to all-block, block-heteric,<br>
heteric-block or all-heteric nonionics.<br>
Polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants suitable for use in the present solid<br>
compositions include those having the structural formula R2CONR1Z in which: Rl is H,<br>

about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms and a polysaccharide, e.g., a polyglycoside,<br>
hydrophilic group containing from about 1.3 to about 10 saccharide units. Any<br>
reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms can be used, e.g., glucose, galactose<br>
and galactosyl moieties can be substituted for the glucosyl moieties. (Optionally the<br>
hydrophobic group is attached at the 2-, 3-, 4-, etc. positions thus giving a glucose or<br>
galactose as opposed to a glucoside or galactoside.) The intersaccharide bonds can be,<br>
e.g., between the one position of the additional saccharide units and the 2-, 3-, 4-,<br>
and/or 6-positions on the preceding saccharide units.<br>

The treatise Nonionic Surfactants, edited by Schick, M.J., Vol. 1 of the<br>
Surfactant Science Series, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1983 is an excellent<br>
reference on the wide variety of nonionic compounds generally employed in the<br>
practice of the present invention. A typical listing of nonionic classes, and species of<br>
these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Heuring on<br>

(Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch).<br>
Semi-Polar Nonionic Surfactants<br>
The semi-polar type of nonionic surface active agents are another class of<br>
nonionic surfactant useful in compositions of the present invention. Generally, semi-<br>
polar nonionics are high foamers and foam stabilizers, which can limit their application<br>
in CIP systems. However, within compositional embodiments of this invention<br>
designed for high foam cleaning methodology, semi-polar nonionics would have<br>
immediate utility. The semi-polar nonionic surfactants include the amine oxides,<br>
phosphine oxides, sulfoxides and their alkoxylated derivatives.<br>
Amine oxides are tertiary amine oxides corresponding to the general formula:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R1, R2,<br>
and R3 may be aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, alicyclic, or combinations thereof.<br>
Generally, for amine oxides of detergent interest, R1 is an alkyl radical of from about 8<br>
to about 24 carbon atoms; R2 and R3 are alkyl or hydroxyalkyl of 1-3 carbon atoms or a<br>
mixture thereof; R2 and R3 can be attached to each other, e.g. through an oxygen or<br>
nitrogen atom, to form a ring structure; R4 is an alkaline or a hydroxyalkylene group<br>
containing 2 to 3 carbon atoms; and n ranges from 0 to about 20.<br>
Useful water soluble amine oxide surfactants are selected from the coconut or<br>
tallow alkyl di-(lower alkyl) amine oxides, specific examples of which are<br>
dodecyldimethylamine oxide, tridecyldimethylamine oxide, etradecyldimethylamine<br>
oxide, pentadecyldimethylamine oxide, hexadecyldimethylamine oxide,<br>
heptadecyldimethylamine oxide, octadecyldimethylaine oxide, dodecyldipropylamine<br>
oxide, tetradecyldipropylamine oxide, hexadecyldipropylamine oxide,<br>
tetradecyldibutylamine oxide, octadecyldibutylamine oxide, bis(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)dodecylamine oxide, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-dodecoxy-1 -<br>
hydroxypropylamine oxide, dimethyl-(2-hydroxydodecyl)amine oxide, 3,6,9-<br>
trioctadecyldimethylamine oxide and 3-dodecoxy-2-hydroxypropyldi-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)amine oxide.<br>
Useful semi-polar nonionic surfactants also include the water soluble phosphine<br>
oxides having the following structure:<br>
 <br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R1 is an<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety ranging from 10 to about 24 carbon atoms in<br>
 <br>
chain length; and, R2 and R3 are each alkyl moieties separately selected from alkyl or<br>
hydroxyalkyl groups containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of useful phosphine oxides include dimethyldecylphosphine oxide,<br>
dimethyltetradecylphosphine oxide, methylethyltetradecylphosphone oxide,<br>
dimethylhexadecylphosphine oxide, diethyl-2-hydroxyoctyldecylphosphine oxide,<br>
bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecylphosphine oxide, and<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)tetradecylphosphine oxide. Semi-polar nonionic surfactants<br>
useful herein also include the water soluble sulfoxide compounds which have the<br>
structure:<br>
 <br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R1 is an<br>
alkyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety of about 8 to about 28 carbon atoms, from 0 to about 5<br>
ether linkages and from 0 to about 2 hydroxyl substituents; and R2 is an alkyl moiety<br>
consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Useful examples of these sulfoxides include dodecyl methyl sulfoxide; 3-<br>
hydroxy tridecyl methyl sulfoxide; 3-methoxy tridecyl methyl sulfoxide; and 3-<br>
hydroxy-4-dodecoxybutyl methyl sulfoxide.<br>
Preferred semi-polar nonionic surfactants for the compositions of the invention<br>
include dimethyl amine oxides, such as lauryl dimethyl amine oxide, myristyl dimethyl<br>
amine oxide, cetyl dimethyl amine oxide, combinations thereof, and the like.<br>
Silicone Surfactant<br>
The silicone surfactant can include a modified dialkyl, e.g., a dimethyl<br>
polysiloxane. The polysiloxane hydrophobic group can be modified with one or more<br>
pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide group or groups. Such surfactants can provide<br>
low surface tension, high wetting, high spreading, antifoaming and excellent stain<br>
 <br>
removal. The silicone surfactants of the invention include a polydialkyl siloxane, e.g., a<br>
polydimethyl siloxane to which polyether, typically polyalkylene oxide, groups have<br>
been grafted through a hydrosilation reaction. The process results in an alkyl pendent<br>
(AP type) copolymer, in which the polyalkylene oxide groups are attached along the<br>
siloxane backbone through a series of hydrolytically stable Si-C bond.<br>
These nonionic substituted poly dialkyl siloxane products have the following<br>
generic formula:<br>
 <br>
wherein PE represents a nonionic group, e.g., -CH2-(CH2)P-O-(EO)m(PO)n-Z, with EO<br>
representing ethylene oxide, PO representing propylene oxide, x is a number that ranges<br>
from about 0 to about 100, y is a number that ranges from about 1 to 100, m, n and p are<br>
numbers that range from about 0 to about 50, m+n â¥1 and Z represents hydrogen or R<br>
wherein each R independently represents a lower (C1-6) straight or branched alkyl.<br>
Such surfactants have a molecular weight (Mn) of about 500 to 20,000.<br>
Other silicone nonionic surfactants have the formula:<br>
 <br>
wherein x represent a number that ranges from about 0 to about 100, y represent a<br>
number that ranges from about 1 to about 100, a and b represent numbers that<br>
independently range from about 0 to about 60, a+b â¥ 1, and each R is independently H<br>
or a lower straight or branched (C1-6) alkyl. A second class of nonionic silicone<br>
 <br>
surfactants is an alkoxy-end-blocked (AEB type) that are less preferred because the Si-<br>
O- bond offers limited resistance to hydrolysis under neutral or slightly alkaline<br>
conditions, but breaks down quickly in acidic environments.<br>
Suitable surfactants are sold under the SILWETÂ® tradename, the TEGOPRENÂ®<br>
trademark or under the ABILÂ® B trademark. One useful surfactant, SILWETÂ® L77, has<br>
the formula:<br>
(CH3)3Si-O(CH3)Si(R1)O-Si(CH3)3<br>
wherein R1 = -CH2CH2CH2-O-[CH2CH2O]zCH3; wherein z is 4 to 16 preferably 4 to<br>
12, most preferably 7-9.<br>
Other useful surfactants include TEGOPREN 5840Â® , ABIL B-8843Â®, ABIL B-<br>
8852Â® and ABIL B-8863Â®.<br>
In certain embodiments, the composition can also include about 0.0005 to about<br>
35 wt-% silicone surfactant, for example, about 1 to about 20 wt-% silicone surfactant.<br>
The silicone surfactant can include a silicone backbone and at least 1 pendant alkylene<br>
oxide group having from about 2 to 100 moles of alkylene oxide. The pendant alkylene<br>
oxide group can include (EO)n wherein n is 3 to 75.<br>
Cationic Surfactants<br>
Surface active substances are classified as cationic if the charge on the<br>
hydrotrope portion of the molecule is positive. Surfactants in which the hydrotrope<br>
carries no charge unless the pH is lowered close to neutrality or lower, but which are<br>
then cationic (e.g. alkyl amines), are also included in this group. In theory, cationic<br>
surfactants may be synthesized from any combination of elements containing an<br>
"onium" structure RnX+Y- and could include compounds other than nitrogen<br>
(ammonium) such as phosphorus (phosphonium) and sulfur (sulfonium). In practice,<br>
the cationic surfactant field is dominated by nitrogen containing compounds, probably<br>
because synthetic routes to nitrogenous cationics are simple and straightforward and<br>
give high yields of product, which can make them less expensive.<br>
 <br>
Cationic surfactants preferably include, more preferably refer to, compounds<br>
containing at least one long carbon chain hydrophobic group and at least one positively<br>
charged nitrogen. The long carbon chain group may be attached directly to the nitrogen<br>
atom by simple substitution; or more preferably indirectly by a bridging functional<br>
group or groups in so-called interrupted alkylamines and amido amines. Such<br>
functional groups can make the molecule more hydrophilic and/or more water<br>
dispersible, more easily water solubilized by co-surfactant mixtures, and/or water<br>
soluble. For increased water solubility, additional primary, secondary or tertiary amino<br>
groups can be introduced or the amino nitrogen can be quaternized with low molecular<br>
weight alkyl groups. Further, the nitrogen can be a part of branched or straight chain<br>
moiety of varying degrees of unsaturation or of a saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic<br>
ring. In addition, cationic surfactants may contain complex linkages having more than<br>
one cationic nitrogen atom.<br>
The surfactant compounds classified as amine oxides, amphoterics and<br>
zwitterions are themselves typically cationic in near neutral to acidic pH solutions and<br>
can overlap surfactant classifications. Polyoxyethylated cationic surfactants generally<br>
behave like nonionic surfactants in alkaline solution and like cationic surfactants in<br>
acidic solution.<br>
The simplest cationic amines, amine salts and quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds can be schematically drawn thus:<br>
 <br>
in which, R represents a long alkyl chain, R1, R", and R'" may be either long alkyl chains<br>
or smaller alkyl or aryl groups or hydrogen and X represents an anion. The amine salts<br>
and quaternary ammonium compounds can be useful due to their high degree of water<br>
solubility.<br>
 <br>
The majority of large volume commercial cationic surfactants can be subdivided<br>
into four major classes and additional sub-groups known to those or skill in the art and<br>
described in "Surfactant Encyclopedia", Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries. Vol. 104 (2) 86-96<br>
(1989). The first class includes alkylamines and their salts. The second class includes<br>
alkyl imidazolines. The third class includes ethoxylated amines. The fourth class<br>
includes quaternaries, such as alkylbenzyldimethylammonium salts, alkyl benzene salts,<br>
heterocyclic ammonium salts, tetra alkylammonium salts, and the like. Cationic<br>
surfactants are known to have a variety of properties that can be beneficial in the<br>
present solid compositions. These desirable properties can include detergency in<br>
compositions of or below neutral pH, antimicrobial efficacy, thickening or gelling in<br>
cooperation with other agents, and the like.<br>
Cationic surfactants useful in the compositions of the present invention include<br>
those having the formula R1 raR2xYLZ wherein each R1 is an organic group containing a<br>
straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted with up to three<br>
phenyl or hydroxy groups and optionally interrupted by up to four of the following<br>
structures:<br>
 <br>
or an isomer or mixture of these structures, and which contains from about 8 to 22<br>
carbon atoms. The R1 groups can additionally contain up to 12 ethoxy groups, m is a<br>
number from 1 to 3. Preferably, no more than one R1 group in a molecule has 16 or<br>
more carbon atoms when m is 2 or more than 12 carbon atoms when m is 3. Each R2 is<br>
an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group<br>
 <br>
with no more than one R2 in a molecule being benzyl, and x is a number from 0 to 11,<br>
preferably from 0 to 6. The remainder of any carbon atom positions on the Y group are<br>
filled by hydrogens.<br>
Y is can be a group including, but not limited to:<br>
 <br>
or a mixture thereof. Preferably, L is 1 or 2, with the Y groups being separated by a<br>
moiety selected from R1 and R2 analogs (preferably alkylene or alkenylene) having from<br>
1 to about 22 carbon atoms and two free carbon single bonds when L is 2. Z is a water<br>
soluble anion, such as a halide, sulfate, methylsulfate, hydroxide, or nitrate anion,<br>
 <br>
<br>
particularly preferred being chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate or methyl sulfate anions,<br>
in a number to give electrical neutrality of the cationic component.<br>
Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
Amphoteric, or ampholytic, surfactants contain both a basic and an acidic<br>
hydrophilic group and an organic hydrophobic group. These ionic entities may be any<br>
of anionic or cationic groups described herein for other types of surfactants. A basic<br>
nitrogen and an acidic carboxylate group are the typical functional groups employed as<br>
the basic and acidic hydrophilic groups. In a few surfactants, sulfonate, sulfate,<br>
phosphonate or phosphate provide the negative charge.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic<br>
secondary and tertiary amines, in which the aliphatic radical may be straight chain or<br>
branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18<br>
carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfo,<br>
sulfato, phosphate, or phosphono. Amphoteric surfactants are subdivided into two<br>
major classes known to those of skill in the art and described in "Surfactant<br>
Encyclopedia" Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries, Vol. 104 (2) 69-71 (1989). The first class<br>
includes acyl/dialkyl ethylenediamine derivatives (e.g. 2-alkyl hydroxyethyl<br>
imidazoline derivatives) and their salts. The second class includes N-alkylamino acids<br>
and their salts. Some amphoteric surfactants can be envisioned as fitting into both<br>
classes.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants can be synthesized by methods known to those of skill<br>
in the art. For example, 2-alkyl hydroxyethyl imidazoline is synthesized by<br>
condensation and ring closure of a long chain carboxylic acid (or a derivative) with<br>
dialkyl ethylenediamine. Commercial amphoteric surfactants are derivatized by<br>
subsequent hydrolysis and ring-opening of the imidazoline ring by alkylation â for<br>
example with chloroacetic acid or ethyl acetate. During alkylation, one or two carboxy-<br>
alkyl groups react to form a tertiary amine and an ether linkage with differing alkylating<br>
agents yielding different tertiary amines.<br>
 <br>
Long chain imidazole derivatives having application in the present invention<br>
generally have the general formula:<br>
 <br>
wherein R is an acyclic hydrophobic group containing from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms<br>
and M is a cation to neutralize the charge of the anion, generally sodium.<br>
Commercially prominent imidazoline-derived amphoterics that can be employed in the<br>
present solid compositions include for example: Cocoamphopropionate,<br>
Cocoamphocarboxy-propionate, Cocoamphoglycinate, Cocoamphocarboxy-glycinate,<br>
Cocoamphopropyl-sulfonate, and Cocoamphocarboxy-propionic acid. Preferred<br>
amphocarboxylic acids are produced from fatty imidazolines in which the dicarboxylic<br>
acid functionality of the amphodicarboxylic acid is diacetic acid and/or dipropionic<br>
acid.<br>
The carboxymethylated compounds (glycinates) described herein above<br>
frequently are called betaines. Betaines are a special class of amphoteric discussed<br>
herein below in the section entitled, Zwitterion Surfactants.<br>
Long chain N-alkylamino acids are readily prepared by reaction RNH2, in which<br>
R=C8-C18 straight or branched chain alkyl, fatty amines with halogenated carboxylic<br>
acids. Alkylation of the primary amino groups of an amino acid leads to secondary and<br>
tertiary amines. Alkyl substituents may have additional amino groups that provide<br>
more than one reactive nitrogen center. Most commercial N-alkylamine acids are alkyl<br>
derivatives of beta-alanine or beta-N(2-carboxyethyl) alanine. Examples of commercial<br>
N-alkylamino acid ampholytes having application in this invention include alkyl beta-<br>
amino dipropionates, RN(C2H4COOM)2 and RNHC2H4COOM. In these R is preferably<br>
 <br>
<br>
an acyclic hydrophobic group containing from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, and M<br>
is a cation to neutralize the charge of the anion.<br>
Preferred amphoteric surfactants include those derived from coconut products<br>
such as coconut oil or coconut fatty acid. The more preferred of these coconut derived<br>
surfactants include as part of their structure an ethylenediamine moiety, an<br>
alkanolamide moiety, an amino acid moiety, preferably glycine, or a combination<br>
thereof; and an aliphatic substituent of from about 8 to 18 (preferably 12) carbon atoms.<br>
Such a surfactant can also be considered an alkyl amphodicarboxylic acid. Disodium<br>
cocoampho dipropionate is one most preferred amphoteric surfactant and is<br>
commercially available under the tradename Miranolâ¢ FBS from Rhodia Inc.,<br>
Cranbury, N.J. Another most preferred coconut derived amphoteric surfactant with the<br>
chemical name disodium cocoampho diacetate is sold under the tradename Miranolâ¢<br>
C2M-SF Cone, also from Rhodia Inc., Cranbury, N.J.<br>
A typical listing of amphoteric classes, and species of these surfactants, is given<br>
in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Hewing on Dec. 30,1975. Further<br>
examples are given in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I and II by<br>
Schwartz, Perry and Berch). .<br>
Zwitterionic Surfactants<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants can be thought of as a subset of the amphoteric<br>
surfactants. Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of<br>
secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary<br>
amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary<br>
sulfonium compounds. Typically, a zwitterionic surfactant includes a positive charged<br>
quaternary ammonium or, in some cases, a sulfonium or phosphonium ion; a negative<br>
charged carboxyl group; and an alkyl group. Zwitterionics generally contain cationic<br>
and anionic groups which ionize to a nearly equal degree in the isoelectric region of the<br>
molecule and which can develop strong" inner-salt" attraction between positive-<br>
negative charge centers. Examples of such zwitterionic synthetic surfactants include<br>
 <br>
derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium<br>
compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight chain or branched, and<br>
wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one<br>
contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate,<br>
phosphate, or phosphonate. Betaine and sultaine surfactants are exemplary zwitterionic<br>
surfactants for use herein.<br>
A general formula for these compounds is:<br>
 <br>
wherein R1 contains an alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxyalkyl radical of from 8 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms having from 0 to 10 ethylene oxide moieties and from 0 to 1 glyceryl moiety; Y<br>
is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; R2 is an<br>
alkyl or monohydroxy alkyl group containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms; x is 1 when Y is a<br>
sulfur atom and 2 when Y is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom, R3 is an alkylene or<br>
hydroxy alkylene or hydroxy alkylene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Z is a radical<br>
selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate, and<br>
phosphate groups.<br>
Examples of zwitterionic surfactants having the structures listed above include:<br>
4-[N,N-di(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-octadecylammonio]-butane-l-carboxylate; 5-[S-3-<br>
hydroxypropyl-S-hexadecylsulfonio]-3-hydroxypentane-l-sulfate; 3-[P,P-diethyl-P-<br>
3,6,9-trioxatetracosanephosphonio]-2-hydroxypropane-l-phosphate; 3-[N,N-dipropyl-<br>
N-3-dodecoxy-2-hydroxypropyl-ammonio]-propane-l-phosphonate; 3-(N,N-dimethyl-<br>
N-hexadecylammonio)-propane-l-sulfonate;3-(N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonio)-<br>
2-hydroxy-propane-l-sulfonate; 4-[N,N-di(2(2-hydroxyethyl)-N(2-<br>
hydroxydodecyl)ammonio]-butane-1-carboxylate; 3-[S-ethyl-S-(3-dodecoxy-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl)sulfonio]-propane-l-phosphate; 3-[P,P-dimethyl-P-dodecylphosphonio]-<br>
propane-1 -phosphonate; and S [N,N-di(3-hydroxypropyl)-N-hexadecylammonio]-2-<br>
 <br>
hydroxy-pentane-1-sulfate. The alkyl groups contained in said detergent surfactants<br>
can be straight or branched and saturated or unsaturated.<br>
The zwitterionic surfactant suitable for use in the present solid compositions<br>
includes a betaine of the general structure:<br>
 <br>
These surfactant betaines typically do not exhibit strong cationic or anionic characters<br>
at pH extremes nor do they show reduced water solubility in their isoelectric range.<br>
Unlike "external" quaternary ammonium salts, betaines are compatible with anionics.<br>
Examples of suitable betaines include coconut acylamidopropyldimethyl betaine;<br>
hexadecyl dimethyl betaine; C12-14 acylamidopropylbetaine; C8-14<br>
acylamidohexyldiethyl betaine; 4-C14-16 acylmethylamidodiethylammonio-1-<br>
carboxybutane; C16-18 acylamidodimethylbetaine; C12-16<br>
acylamidopentanediethylbetaine; and C12-16 acylmethylamidodimethylbetaine.<br>
Sultaines useful in the present invention include those compounds having the<br>
formula (R(R1)2 N+ R2SO3-, in which R is a C6 -C18 hydrocarbyl group, each R1 is<br>
typically independently C1-C3 alkyl, e.g. methyl, and R2 is a C1-C6 hydrocarbyl group,<br>
e.g. a C1-C3 alkylene or hydroxyalkylene group.<br>
A typical listing of zwitterionic classes, and species of these surfactants, is given<br>
in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Heuring on Dec. 30, 1975. Further<br>
examples are given in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I and II by<br>
Schwartz, Perry and Berch).<br>
Surfactant Compositions<br>
The surfactants described hereinabove can be used singly or in combination in<br>
the practice and utility of the present invention. In particular, the nonionics and<br>
anionics can be used in combination. The semi-polar nonionic, cationic, amphoteric<br>
 <br>
<br>
and zwitterionic surfactants can be employed in combination with nonionics or<br>
anionics. The above examples are merely specific illustrations of the numerous<br>
surfactants which can find application within the scope of this invention. The foregoing<br>
organic surfactant compounds can be formulated into any of the several commercially<br>
desirable composition forms of this invention having disclosed utility. Said<br>
compositions include washing treatments for soiled surfaces in concentrated form<br>
which, when dispensed or dissolved in water, properly diluted by a proportionating<br>
device, and delivered to the target surfaces as a solution, gel or foam will provide<br>
cleaning. Said cleaning treatments consisting of one product; or, involving a two<br>
product system wherein proportions of each are utilized. Said product is typically a<br>
concentrate of liquid or emulsion.<br>
A solid cleaning composition as used in the present disclosure encompasses a<br>
variety of forms including, for example, solids, pellets, blocks, and tablets, but not waxy<br>
powders. It should be understood that the term "solid" refers to the state of the cleaning<br>
composition under the expected conditions of storage and use of the solid cleaning<br>
composition. In general, it is expected that the cleaning composition will remain a solid<br>
when provided at a temperature of up to about 100 Â°F or greater than 120 Â°F.<br>
In certain embodiments, the solid cleaning composition is provided in the form<br>
of a unit dose. A unit dose refers to a solid cleaning composition unit sized so that the<br>
entire unit is used during a single washing cycle. When the solid cleaning composition<br>
is provided as a unit dose, it can have a mass of about 1 g to about 50 g. In other<br>
embodiments, the composition can be a solid, a pellet, or a tablet having a size of about<br>
50 g to 250 g, of about 100 g or greater, or about 40 g to about 11,000 g.<br>
In other embodiments, the solid cleaning composition is provided in the form of<br>
a multiple-use solid, such as, a block or a plurality of pellets, and can be repeatedly<br>
used to generate aqueous cleaning compositions for multiple washing cycles. In certain<br>
embodiments, the solid cleaning composition is provided as a cast solid, an extruded<br>
block, or a tablet having a mass of about 5 g to 10 kg. In certain embodiments, a<br>
multiple-use form of the solid cleaning composition has a mass of about 1 to 10 kg. In<br>
 <br>
<br>
further embodiments, a multiple-use form of the solid cleaning composition has a mass<br>
of about 5 kg to about 8 kg. In other embodiments, a multiple-use form of the solid<br>
cleaning composition has a mass of about 5 g to about 1 kg, or about 5 g and to 500 g.<br>
In some embodiments, the solids formed by the methods described herein<br>
comprise a multi-part system. The solids can be a two-part, three-part, or four-part<br>
system for example. In some embodiments, each part will include the same<br>
composition. In other embodiments, each part will include different compositions. In<br>
still yet other embodiments, some parts can include equivalent compositions and some<br>
parts can include different compositions, e.g., a three part system where two of the parts<br>
include the same composition and one of the parts includes a different composition.<br>
The parts can be formed to provide the solid with a variety of desired<br>
characteristics including, for example: multiple cleaning formulations (e.g., one part<br>
includes an acidic cleaner, one part includes an alkaline cleaner, and a third optional<br>
part includes a buffer, wherein the third part can be positioned between the first and<br>
second parts); or solids designed to have different parts with different dissolution rates<br>
(e.g., one part contains a fast dissolving solid, and one part contains a slower dissolving<br>
solid).<br>
Packaging System<br>
In some embodiments, the solid composition can be packaged. The packaging<br>
receptacle or container may be rigid or flexible, and composed of any material suitable<br>
for containing the compositions produced according to the invention, as for example<br>
glass, metal, plastic film or sheet, cardboard, cardboard composites, paper, and the like.<br>
Advantageously, since the composition is processed at or near ambient<br>
temperatures, the temperature of the processed mixture is low enough so that the<br>
mixture may be formed directly in the container or other packaging system without<br>
structurally damaging the material. As a result, a wider variety of materials may be used<br>
to manufacture the container than those used for compositions that processed and<br>
dispensed under molten conditions.<br>
 <br>
Suitable packaging used to contain the compositions is manufactured from a<br>
flexible, easy opening film material.<br>
In some embodiments, a solid composition formed according to the methods of<br>
the present invention is packaged directly upon formation. That is, a solid composition<br>
is formed in the packaging from which it will be stored or dispensed. In some<br>
embodiments, the solid will be formed directly into a thin film plastic or a shrink<br>
wrapper. The solid may be formed in an packaging suitable for storage and/or<br>
dispensing of the solid.<br>
Dispensing the Compositions<br>
The cleaning composition made according to the present invention can be<br>
dispensed in any suitable method generally known. The cleaning composition can be<br>
dispensed from a spray-type dispenser such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,826,661, 4,690,305,4,687,121,4,426,362 and in U.S. Patent Nos. Re 32,763 and<br>
32,818, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Briefly, a spray-<br>
type dispenser functions by impinging a water spray upon an exposed surface of the<br>
solid composition to dissolve a portion of the composition, and then immediately<br>
directing the concentrate solution including the composition out of the dispenser to a<br>
storage reservoir or directly to a point of use. When used, the product is removed from<br>
the package (e.g.) film and is inserted into the dispenser. The spray of water can be<br>
made by a nozzle in a shape that conforms to the solid shape. The dispenser enclosure<br>
can also closely fit the cleaning composition shape in a dispensing system that prevents<br>
the introduction and dispensing of an incorrect cleaning composition. The aqueous<br>
concentrate is generally directed to a use locus.<br>
In some embodiments, the compositions hereof will be formulated such that<br>
during use in aqueous cleaning operations the wash water will have a pH of between<br>
about 1 and about 14, about 6.5 to about 11, or 7-10.5. Techniques for controlling pH<br>
at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkali, acids, etc., and are well<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition can be dispensed by immersing<br>
either intermittently or continuously in water. The composition can then dissolve, for<br>
example, at a controlled or predetermined rate. The rate can be effective to maintain a<br>
concentration of dissolved cleaning agent that is effective for cleaning.<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition can be dispensed by scraping solid<br>
from the solid composition and contacting the scrapings with water. The scrapings can<br>
be added to water to provide a concentration of dissolved cleaning agent that is<br>
effective for cleaning.<br>
Methods Employing the Solid Compositions<br>
It is contemplated that the cleaning compositions of the invention can be used in<br>
a broad variety of industrial, household, health care, vehicle care, and other such<br>
applications. Some examples include surface disinfectant, ware cleaning, laundry<br>
cleaning, laundry cleaning or sanitizing, vehicle cleaning, floor cleaning, surface<br>
cleaning, pre-soaks, clean in place, and a broad variety of other such applications. The<br>
present solid product can be configured, for example, as an air freshener, a urinal block,<br>
a drain ring, or a laundry bar.<br>
In some embodiments, an aqueous dispersion of the present solid composition is<br>
directly applied to a heavy soil deposit, permitted to soften and promote soil removal.<br>
Once the composition has been permitted to enhance the removability of the soil, the<br>
cleaner and removed soil can be readily removed with a rinse step. Liquid containing<br>
the compositions of the invention including an anionic surfactant can be directly<br>
contacted with the hard surface for the removal of organic, oily or greasy soils.<br>
Depending on substrate, such a composition can additionally include a chelating agent<br>
to have a final formulation including an anionic surfactant and a chelating agent. These<br>
compositions can be used on substantially non-corrosive surfaces such as plastics,<br>
wood, coated wood, stainless steels, composite materials, fabrics, cement, and others.<br>
In some embodiments, the present method includes a method of cleaning a hard<br>
surface. The method can include applying to the surface a cleaning composition<br>
 <br>
<br>
including spore, bacteria, or enzyme; borate salt; and anionic surfactant. The method<br>
can include applying the composition to a floor, a drain, or a combination thereof. In an<br>
embodiment, the method omits rinsing. That is, an aqueous dispersion of the present<br>
solid composition can be applied and the surface is not rinsed.<br>
In some embodiments, the present method includes a method of cleaning a floor.<br>
Such a method can include increasing the coefficient of friction of the floor. Such a<br>
method can include cleaning the grout of a tile floor. Cleaning grout can include<br>
allowing more of its natural color to show. The method includes applying a stabilized<br>
spore composition according to the present invention to the floor. In some<br>
embodiments, the method does not include (e.g., omits) rinsing. In some embodiments,<br>
the present method can include effectively removing from flooring (e.g., tile) a slippery-<br>
when-wet film. The method can include cleaning the flooring and increasing its<br>
coefficient of friction.<br>
In some embodiments, the present method of cleaning a hard surface can include<br>
applying a liquid dispersion of the present solid composition to a bathroom surface,<br>
such as a wall, floor, or fixture. The bathroom surface can be a shower wall or surface.<br>
The bathroom surface can be a tiled wall. A composition for use on a vertical surface<br>
can include a thickener, humectant, or foaming surfactant. Applying the composition to<br>
the vertical surface can include foaming the composition. In some embodiments, the<br>
present solid composition includes a thickener or humectant, which can assist in<br>
retaining the composition on a horizontal or vertical surface. In other embodiments, the<br>
present method of cleaning a hard surface can include applying a liquid dispersion of<br>
the present solid composition to ware.<br>
In some embodiments, the present method can include applying a liquid<br>
dispersion of the present solid composition to a surface that has grease or oil on it.<br>
Such surfaces include a floor, a parking lot, a drive through pad, a garage floor, a<br>
parking ramp floor, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments, the present method includes spraying or misting a surface<br>
with a liquid dispersion of the present solid composition.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the present method includes applying the stabilized<br>
microbial composition to a surface and keeping the surface moist for an extended<br>
period, such as one or two hours up to about eight to about 16 hours. Keeping the<br>
surface moist can be accomplished by repeated application of the composition, such as<br>
by misting. Keeping the surface moist can be accomplished by contacting the surface<br>
with a sponge, rag, or mop wet with the composition for an extended period. Keeping<br>
the surface moist can be accomplished by applying a persistent stable microbial<br>
composition. A persistent stable microbial composition can remain on the surface and<br>
keep the surface moist. For example, a thickened composition and certain foamed<br>
compositions can remain on the surface and keep the surface moist. Extended presence<br>
of the present solid composition can provide more rapid cleaning compared to a<br>
composition that dries or evaporates.<br>
Foaming<br>
In an embodiment, the present solid composition can be mixed with diluent to<br>
form a use composition that is used in a foamer. Foaming application can be<br>
accomplished, for example, using a foam application device such as a tank foamer or an<br>
aspirated wall mounted foamer, e.g., employing a foamer nozzle of a trigger sprayer.<br>
Foaming application can be accomplished by placing the use composition in a fifteen<br>
gallon foam application pressure vessel, such as a fifteen gallon capacity stainless steel<br>
pressure vessel with mix propeller. The foaming composition can then be dispensed<br>
through a foaming trigger sprayer. A wall mounted foamer can use air to expel foam<br>
from a tank or line. In an embodiment, compressed air can be injected into the mixture,<br>
then applied to the object through a foam application device such as a tank foamer or an<br>
aspirated wall mounted foamer.<br>
Mechanical foaming heads that can be used according to the invention to<br>
provide foam generation include those heads that cause air and the foaming<br>
composition to mix and create a foamed composition. That is, the mechanical foaming<br>
 <br>
<br>
head causes air and the foaming composition to mix in a mixing chamber and then pass<br>
through an opening to create a foam.<br>
Suitable mechanical foaming heads that can be used according to the invention<br>
include those available from Airspray International, Inc. of Pompano Beach, Florida,<br>
and from Zeller Plastik, a division of Crown Cork and Seal Co. Suitable mechanical<br>
foaming heads that can be used according to the invention are described in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. D-452,822; U.S. Patent No. D-452,653; U.S. Patent No. D-<br>
456,260; and U.S. Patent No. 6,053,364. Mechanical foaming heads that can be used<br>
according to the invention includes those heads that are actuated or intended to be<br>
actuated by application of finger pressure to a trigger that causes the foaming<br>
composition and air to mix and create a foam. That is, a person's finger pressure can<br>
cause the trigger to depress thereby drawing the foaming composition and air into the<br>
head and causing the foaming composition and air to mix and create a foam.<br>
The present invention can be better understood with reference to the following<br>
examples. These examples are intended to be representative of specific embodiments of<br>
the invention, and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
