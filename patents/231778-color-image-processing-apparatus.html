Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:<br>
FIGS. 1A and IB are flow diagrams showing a color image processing method according to the present invention: and<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a color image processing apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
Rest mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A illustrating a color image processing method according to the present invention, a color image is input (step 100). The color image may be in one region selected among image regions segmented by an appropriate segmentation method.<br>
Next, with respect to color vectors of all pixels in a LXL window in an input color image, the color distance djn) from the color vector X(l(n) of a pixel positioned at a position n at the center of the LXL window is represented by Expression (1) (step 102):<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
A'herein L is an arbitrary positive integer, and assuming that A'=L:- I. / is an integer<br>
rom 0 through K.    Also, for convenience' sake of explanation. X,,(n).  which<br>
represents the color vector of <i pixel positioned a position at the center of></i>
L'L window in an mpui color image. m;iy he used 10 represent the corresponding<br>
pixel positioned ;u ihe center, dial is ,i central pixel<br>
Next, the corresponding color vectors of all pixels in the window are sorted in an ascending order according to the magnitude of the color distance dt(n) (step 104). Hereinbelow. the color vectors sorted in ascending order will be represented byX,(n).<br>
Now, with respect to the color vectors sorted in ascending order, color distance difference is calculated by Expression (2) (step 106):<br>
and then color vectors in which f,(n) is greater than a predetermined threshold Q are removed (step 108). That is. the color vectors in which f,(n) is greater than a predetermined threshold Q are considered impulse noise to then he removed. According to experimental confirmation, it is more preferably to perform the step 108 with respect to the beginning L/2 pixels and the latter L/2 pixels in ascending<br>
order, than to perform it with respect to all the (L:- 1) pixels in the L---L window.<br>
except of the central pixel X,,(n).<br>
Also, according to the present invention, in order to prevent edge blurring of<br>
an image, filtering is performed on pixels in a peer group to be described later.<br>
rather than on all the pixels in the LXL window.   The peer groups are obtained as<br>
follows.<br>
First, the pixels sorted in ascending order according to their color distance<br>
from the color vector of the central pixel are divided into two groups.   The first<br>
group consists of Oth through (i-l)ih pixels, and the second group consists of /th<br>
through ATth pixels.<br>
Next, the average of the color distance differences for pixels of the first<br>
group and the average of the color distance differences for pixels of the second group<br>
are obtained as represented by Expressions (3a) and (?h). respectively:<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
and the variance of the color distance differences for pixels of the first croup and the variance of the color distance difference for pixels of the second group are obtained as represented by Expressions (3c) and (3d), respectively:<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
wherein / is a newly defined integer ranging from 0 through K.<br>
Then, using the obtained average and variance, a value J(i) represented by Expression (4) is calculated (step 110):<br>
wherein / is an integer ranging from 1 through K.   The Expression (4) is based on Fisher's discriminant estimation method.<br>
Here, the actual range of / is from 1 through the numbers obtained by<br>
subtracting the number corresponding to color vectors of the pixels considered as<br>
impulse noise for removal from K.   However, since the number corresponding to<br>
' color vectors of the pixels considered as impulse noise and removed is not so large.<br>
it is assumed that the range of/ is from 1 through K.<br>
Next, the value of / which makes J(i) maximum is obtained by Expression (5):<br>
(Equation  Removed)<br>
10 then determine the obtained value of/ as the magnitude of a peer group P(n) (step 112). In other words, when / is reset to variables ranging from 0 through the value obtained in (he step 112. the peer group P(n) consists of pixels p,(n)<br>
Referring (o RG.   ID. ihc central pixel X,,(n) is replaced with a new pixel<br><br>
X'0(n) by Expression (6):<br>
 (Equation  Removed)<br>
where W, are the standard Gaussian weights corresponding to p,(n) (step 114). Here, the standard Gaussian weights Wt are determined by a standard Gaussian function. A pixel closer to the center of an image has a larger standard Gaussian weight and a pixel distant from the center has a smaller standard Gaussian weight. The procedure of replacing pixels in such a manner is smoothing or filtering.<br>
Supposing the maximum color distance in each peer group d..,,,,, ,(n) is T(n). exp(-T(n)) is applied to the color vectors of the respective pixels during color quantization (step 116). The maximum color distance dmim ,(n) in each peer group indicates the largest value of the color distances of pixels whose number correspond to the size of the peer group ranging from the pixel having the minimum color distance, among the pixels soned in ascending order according to their color distance from the central pixel. Thus, the smaller the maximum color distance dm(n) ,(n) in each peer group, the shorter the color distance from the central pixel, so that dni<n is an indicator of the smoothness image. also since exp weighted to color vectors respective pixels in smooth regions ire more heavily than highly noisy regions. weighting lightly>ased on the analysis result of eye-perception, that is. the eye-perception is more ;ensitive to changes in detailed regions than in smooth regions.!<br>
According to the present invention, during quantizaiion. the value obtained iy multiplying a predetermined constant with the average of T(n) values of all mages is preferably used as the number of clusters. In other words, during uantization. fewer clusters are used in smooth regions where the T(n) value is mall, and more clusters arc used in highly noisy regions where the T(n) value is iree<br>
In the color image processing method according to the present invention, only the pixels having large color distances from the central pixel are removed, and then a peer group having a color vector similar to that of the central pixel is defined to then perform filtering thereon. Thus, edge blurring of an image rarely occurs due to removal and filtering of impulse noise. Also, according to the present invention, the information on the extent of quantization to be performed on an image can be obtained.<br>
The color image processing method is programmable by a computer program. Codes and code segments constituting the computer program can be easily derived by a computer programmer in the an. Also, the program is stored in computer readable media and is readable and executable by the computer, thereby embodying the color image processing method. The media include magnetic recording media, optical recording media, carrier wave media, and the like.<br>
Also, the color image processing method can be implemented on a color image processing apparatus. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a color image processing apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2. the color image processing apparatus according to the present invention includes a segmenting unit 200. a sorting unit 202. an impulse noise removing unit 204. a grouping unit 206. a filtering unit 208 and a quantizing unit 210.<br>
In the operation of the color image processing apparatus, the segmenting unit 200 receives a color image frame and segments the color image frame into a plurality of color images by a predetermined segmentation method.<br>
The sorting unit 202 sets an L*L window (L is a predetermined positive integer.) within the color images, and sorts the pixels within the window according to the color distance between each pixel and the central pixel. Thus, the sorting umi 202 outputs color vectors of the sorted pixels.<br>
The impulse noise removing unit 204 removes the pixels thai have a difference in color distance from the central pixel greater than a predetermined threshold, with respect to the beginning L/2 pixels and (he latter L/2 pixels among ihe sorted pixels.<br>
The grouping unit 206 receives color vectors ol all (he noise-removed pixeK<br>
in the LXL window and divides the same into two groups in which the difference in the intragroup color distance is minimum and the difference in the intergroup color difference is maximum, by calculating the function represented by the Expression (4) using the variance and average of the color distances between the sorted pixels.<br>
The filtering unit 208 performs filtering by replacing the central pixels with pixels in a group having a small difference from the color vector of the central pixels in the window.<br>
The quantizing unit 210 weights the color vectors of the respective pixels by exp(-T(n)), in which T(n) is the maximum color distance within a group having a small difference in the color vector from the central pixel within the window, and performs quantization using the value obtained by multiplying a predetermined constant with the average of T(n) values of all images as the number of clusters.<br>
In the above-described color image processing apparatus according to the present invention, since the pixels having large color distances from the central pixel are removed, a peer group having a color vector similar to that of the central pixel is defined to then perform filtering thereon. Thus, edge blurring of an image rarely occurs due to removal and filtering of impulse noise. Also, according to the present invention, the information on the number of clusters for quantization to be performed can be obtained based on the smoothness or details of an image to be processed. Thus, quantization is can be effectively performed using the information. As described above, according to the present invention, in removing impulse noise from an image and filtering the same, the generation of edge blurring of the imase can be reduced.<br>
