THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] A CONTROL UNIT FOR A VEHICLE<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1 1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a control unit for a vehicle.<br>
..[-Detailed Description -of-the;-lnvention]. [0001] [Technical Field to Which the invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a control device for a vehicle having a plurality of control boards arranged in a layered structure,, a plurality of control elements mounted on each control board, and a" case for enclosing.the control boards tb provide a unit structure. [0002} " [Prior Art]<br>
A control device for a vehicle is known from Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 3-23828 entitled "Full-Wave Rectification Device" for Vehicle", for example.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1".and 15. in this publication (reference numerals used herein in the description of the<br>
2<br><br>
prior art are the same as those used in this publication), a metallic member 38 (which will be hereinafter referred to as "first board") is mounted through an insulating layer 34 on a metallic plate 33. A circuit board 54 {which will be hereinafter referred to as "second board") is placed on  the metallic member 38 in a layered structure, and rectifier elements 39 and 40 and a thyristor 41 are mounted on the metallic member 38. Further, AC input terminals 58, 59, and 60 (which will be hereinafter referred to as "wires") and DC input terminals 61 and 62 (which will be hereinafter referred to as "wires") are mounted on one end of the metallic member 38.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above-mentioned full-wave rectification device, the second board is laid over the first board in a layered structure to increase the area of a control board, so that a large number of control elements including the rectifier elements 39 and 40 and the thyristor 41 can be mounted on the control board.<br>
However, the wires increase in number with an increase in number of the control elements including the rectifier elements 39 and 40 and the thyristor 41. As a<br>
3<br><br>
result, the spacing between the wires decreases with an increase in number of the wires, causing a difficulty of production of the device and a requirement for much consideration to the quality of the device.  Further, since the wires are collectively arranged at one position, a coupler connected to the wires becomes large in size, so that it is difficult to fit the device in a narrow space and the degree of freedom of design of the device is limited. [0004]<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a technique for allowing a control device on which many control elements are mounted to be easily fitted in a narrow space. [0005] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
According to claim 1, there is provided a control device for a vehicle having a plurality of control boards arranged in a layered structure, a plurality of control elements mounted on each of the control boards, and a case for enclosing the control boards to provide a unit structure, wherein wires extending from the control boards are allocated to a plurality of couplers. [0006]<br>
4<br><br>
The layered structure of the plural control boards each mounting the control elements is preferable in increasing the area of a control board to thereby increase the number of control elements that can be mounted on the control board.  Further, the unit structure*." obtained by enclosing the control boards each mounting the control elements in the case is preferable in facilitating the mounting of the control device on the vehicle.<br>
In this respect, the control device of the present invention has the layered structure of the control boards and the unit structure of the case enclosing the control boards.  Furthermore, the wires extending from the control<br>
boards are allocated to the plural couplers.<br>
By allocating the wires extending from the control<br>
boards to the plural couplers, the degree of freedom of layout in mounting the control device on the vehicle can<br>
be increased, and the degree of freedom of design of the<br>
control device can also be increased.<br>
As a result, the design of the vehicle can be<br>
improved by. the increase in the degree of freedom of<br>
layout. Further, the cost of the control device can be<br>
reduced by the increase in the degree of freedom of<br>
design.<br>
5<br><br>
[0007]<br>
According to claim 2, the couplers are mounted on different wall surfaces of the case.<br>
With the arrangement that the couplers are mounted on different wall surfaces of the case, wire harnesses extending from the couplers can be located on the sides of the different wall surfaces, so that the degree of freedom of layout can be further increased. [0008]<br>
According to claim 3, the couplers are arranged in a lateral direction of the vehicle in mounting the case on the vehicle.<br>
With the arrangement that the couplers are arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle, the workability in maintenance of the control device can be improved. [0009]<br>
According to claim 4, semiconductor elements having high heating values as some of the control elements are collectively mounted on one of the plural control boards.<br>
With the arrangement that the semiconductor elements having high heating values as some of the control elements are collectively mounted on one of the plural control boards, thermal effects on the other control elements can be minimized.<br>
6<br><br>
[0010]<br>
According to claim 5, the case is formed of metal, and the semiconductor elements having high heating values are mounted through the control board on the metallic case.<br>
With the arrangement that the case is formed of metal and the semiconductor elements having high heating values are mounted through the control board on the metallic case, heat radiation from the semiconductor elements having high heating values can be accelerated. [0011]<br>
According to claim 6, the metallic case has a radiating surface formed with a plurality of radiating fins.<br>
With the arrangement that the metallic case has a radiating surface formed with a plurality of radiating fins, the heat radiation from the control device can be further accelerated. [0012]<br>
According to claim 7, the couplers are provided so as to respectively correspond to the plural control boards.<br>
With the arrangement that the couplers are provide-so as to respectively correspond to the plural control<br>
7<br><br>
boards, the mount densities of the control boards can be uniformed.<br>
[0013]<br>

The rear wheel 47 is composed of a body portion 61, a tray portion 62 formed integrally with the body portion 61 at its front end, and a rear portion 63 mounted on the body portion 61 at its rear end. [0021]<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a control device. 70 is assembled with the tray portion 62 of the rear fender 47. Although not shown in FIG. 2, the radiator reservoir tank 37 and the battery 38 shown in FIG. 1 are also assembled with the tray portion 62 of the rear fender 47.  Thus, the rear fender 47 with which the control device 70, the radiator reservoir tank 37, and the battery 38 are preliminarily assembled is mounted on the body frame 11 (see FIG. 1).  Since the assembly of the rear fender 47 with the control device 70, the radiator reservoir tank 37, and the battery 38 is mounted on the body frame 11, the assemblability of the vehicle can be improved and the serviceability can also be improved. [0022]<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross section taken along the line 3-3 in FIG. 2.  As shown in FIG. 3, the control device 70 includes a first unit board 71 having a plurality of semiconductor elements 76 as control elements having high heating values; a first coupler 81 connected to the first unit board 71; a first filler 73 for fixing the first unit board 71; a second unit board 72 having a plurality of semiconductor elements 77 {only one of them being shown} as control elements having low heating values, electrolytic capacitors 7 8 having relatively large<br><br>
heights, and passive elements 79 such as resistors; a second coupler 82 connected to the second unit board 72, a second filler 74 for fixing the second unit board 72, and a case 75 for enclosing the first and second unit boards 71 and 72 and the first and second fillers 73 and 74 and for mounting the first and second couplers 81 and 82.  The control device 70 functions to control ignition to the engine 21 (see FIG. 1), control charge/discharge to the battery 38 (see FIG. 1), and control the operation of a starter motor (not shown).  Reference numeral 88 denotes one of a plurality of pin terminals for connecting the first unit board 71 to the second unit board 72. [0023]<br>
The first unit board 71 is configured by  mounting the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values on a printed board 71a as a control board.  The back surface of the printed board 71a is mounted directly on the case 75, so as to accelerate heat radiation from the semiconductor elements 76.  Accordingly, the printed board 71a is preferably formed from a board having good thermal conductivity, such as a board using glass fabric based epoxy resin or fluororesin.<br>
The second unit board 72 is configured by mounting<br><br>
the semiconductor elements 77 having low heating values, the electrolytic capacitors 78, and the passive elements 79 on a printed board 72a as another control board. The printed board 72a may be formed from a general phenol-resin printed board. [0024]<br>
The first filler 73 is preferably formed of a resin material having good thermal conductivity, such as silicone resin.  The second filler" 74 may be formed from a general filler.<br>
The case 75 is a metallic case formed of light metal.  The case 75 is formed with a relatively deep recess 83, a relatively shallow recess 84, a partition wall 85 for separating the recesses 83 and 84 from each other, a plurality of radiating fins 86a, 86b, and 86c for accelerating heat radiation (the radiating fins 86a and 86c being shown in FIG. 2), and a plurality of projections 87 to be mounted on an external member.  Each projection 87 is formed with a hole 87a for insertion of a screw. [0025]<br>
Thus, the control device 70 is characterized in that the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values as control elements are collectively mounted on<br>
18<br><br>
one of the plural control boards (the printed boards 71a and 72a).<br>
By collectively mounting the semiconductor elements<br>
76	having high heating values as control elements on one<br>
of the plural printed boards 71a and 72a, thermal ef-fects<br>
on the other control elements (the semiconductor elements<br>
77	having low heating values) can be minimized.<br>
[0026]<br>
The control device 70 is further characterized in that the case 75 is a metallic case and that the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values are mounted through the control board (the printed board 71a) on this metallic case 75.<br>
Since the case 75 is a metallic case and the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values are mounted through the printed board 71a on this metallic case 75, heat radiation from the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values can be accelerated. [0027]<br>
FIG. 4 is a view taken in the direction of the arrow 4 in FIG. 2, showing a plan view of the control device 70.<br>
The first coupler 81 includes a housing 81a, a plurality of L-shaped terminals 81b and 81c extending<br><br><br>
from the housing 81a, and a wire harness 81d connected to the terminals 81b and 81c.  Similarly, the second coupler 82 includes a housing 82a, a plurality of L-shaped terminals 82b and 82c extending from the housing 82a, and a wire harness 82d connected to the terminals 82b and 82c. The terminals 81b and 81c of the first coupler 81 are connected to the printed board 71a, and the terminals 82b and 82c of the second coupler 82 are connected to the printed board 72a. [0028]<br>
Thus, the control device 70 is a control unit having a plurality of control boards each mounting control elements in a layered structure and a case enclosing these control boards.  The control device 7 0 is further characterized in that wires (the wire harnesses 81d and 82d) extending from the control boards (the printed boards 71a and 72a) are allocated to a plurality of couplers (the first and second couplers 81 and 82). [0029]<br>
The layered structure of the printed boards 71a and 72a mounting the control elements (the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values and the semiconductor elements 77 having low heating values as shown in FIG. 3) is preferable in increasing the area of<br><br>
a control board to thereby increase the number of control elements that can be mounted on the control board. Further, the unit structure obtained by enclosing the printed boards 71a and 72a mounting the control elements in the case 75 is preferable in facilitating the mounting of the control device 70 on the vehicle. [0030]<br>
In this respect, the control device 70 has the layered structure of the printed boards 71a and 72a and the unit structure of the case 7 5 enclosing the printed boards 71a and 72a.  Furthermore, the wires extending from the printed boards 71a and 72a are allocated to the first and second couplers 81 and 8 2 in the control device 7 0. With this arrangement, the degree of freedom of layout in mounting the control device 70 on the vehicle can be increased, and the degree of freedom of design of the control device 70 can also be increased.<br>
By increasing the degree of freedom of layout, the design of the vehicle can be improved.  By increasing the degree of freedom of design, the cost of the control device 70 can be reduced. [0031]<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross section taken along the line 5-5 in FIG. 4.  As shown in FIG. 5, the first coupler 81 is<br><br><br>
connected to the printed board 71a, and the second coupler 82 is connected to the printed board 72a.  That is, the first and second couplers 81 and 82 are provided so as to respectively correspond to the printed boards 71a and 72a.<br>
Since the first and second couplers 81 and 82 are provided so as to respectively correspond to the printed boards 71a and^72a (control boards), the mount densities of the control boards can be uniformed. [0032]<br>
The operation of the control device 70 will now be described.<br>
FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b) illustrate the operation of the control device 70. As shown in FIG. 6(a), the semiconductor elements 7 6 having high heating values are mounted on the printed board 71a, and the back surface of the printed board 71a is fixed directly to the case 75. Accordingly, heat generated from the semiconductor elements 7 6 can be radiated as shown by the arrows ®. Further, the case 75 has the radiating fins 86a, 86b, and 86c (the fins 86a and 86c being shown in FIG. 2), so that the heat radiation from the semiconductor elements 76 can be accelerated. [0033]<br><br><br>
The case 75 is a metallic case, and the semiconductor elements 76 having high heating values are mounted through the control board (the.printed board 71a) on the metallic case 75.  Accordingly, the heat radiation from the semiconductor elements 76 can be further accelerated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6(b), the case 75 has the relatively deep recess 83.  Accordingly, the electrolytic capacitors 78 having relatively large heights can be easily accommodated in the recess 83. [0034]<br>
FIG. 7 is a plan view showing a mounted condition of the control device 70.  As shown in FIG. 7, the first coupler 81 is mounted on a wall surface 75a of the case 75, and the second coupler 82 is mounted on another wall surface 75b of the case 75.  Accordingly, the wire harnesses 81d and 82d respectively extending from the first and second couplers 81 and 82 can be easily disposed in a given space. [0035]<br>
Thus, the control device 70 is further characterized in that the first and second couplers 81 and 82 are mounted on the different wall surfaces 75a and 7 5b of the case 75.  With this arrangement, the wire<br><br><br>
harnesses 81d and 82d respectively extending from the first and second couplers 81 and 82 can also be located on the sides of the different wall surfaces 75a and 75b, respectively.  Accordingly, the degree of freedom of layout of the control device 70 can be further increased. [0036]<br>
The control device 7 0 is further characterized in that the first and second couplers 81 and 82 are arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle in mounting the case 75 on the vehicle.<br>
Since the first and second couplers 81 and 82 are arranged in the lateral direction in mounting the case 75 on the body frame 11 {see FIG. 1), the workability in maintenance of the control device 7 0 can be improved. [0037]<br>
FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of a power supply system 24 0 including the control device 7 0.  The power supply system 240 includes a battery 38, a battery isolation relay 242 connected through a main fuse 241 to the battery 38, a starter relay 243 connected to the battery isolation relay 242 and the battery 38, an ACG starter 233 connected through a boosting rectifier circuit 244 to the starter relay 243, FET driving means 253 for driving FETs 245 to 250 constituting the boosting<br><br>
rectifier circuit 244, an oscillator 254 and control means 255 for supplying pulses for chopper (which means conversion of a direct current into.an alternating current, next amplification (boosting) in the AC state, and next reconversion of the amplified AC output into a direct current) to the FET driving means 253, a main switch 34 connected through a first diode 256 and a second diode 257 to the battery 38 and the ACG starter 233, respectively, a starter switch 212 connected to the main switcn 54  and" the   control means 255,   FETs   262  ancf 263 respectively connected to a fue^ pump 36 and a general load 261 to which power is supplied from the battery isolation relay 242 through a sub-fuse 258, and an FET 264 connected to the starter relay 243. [0038]<br>
The control device 70 has a circuit composed mainly of the oscillator 254, the control means 255, the FETs 245 to 250 as the semiconductor elements 76 (see FIG. 3), the FET driving means 253, the FETs 262 to 264 as the semiconductor elements 77 (see FIG. 3)t   and a CDI (Capacitive Discharge Ignition) device 217 to be hereinafter described. [0039]<br>
The starter switch 212 is composed of a first fixed<br><br><br>
contact 2 66 connected to the main switch 34, a second fixed contact 2 67 connected to the control means 2 55, and a movable contact 268 adapted to come into contact with or separation from the first and second fixed contacts 266 and 267. [0040]<br>
The main switch 34 is composed of a fixed contact<br>
271	connected to the control means 255, a movable contact<br>
272	adapted to come into contact with or separation from the fixed contact 271 and connected to the battery 38   and the ACG starter 233, and an antitheft switch section 273 connected to the movable contact 272.<br>
[00413<br>
The antitheft switch section 273 is connected to an antitheft device (not shown) .  When the movable contact 272 of the main switch 34 is in contact with the fixed contact 271 (i.e., on state), the antitheft switch section 273 is off, whereas when the movable contact 272 is in separation from the fixed contact 271 (i.e., off state), the antitheft switch section 273 is on.<br>
[0042]<br>
The ACG starter 233 functions both as a starter motor and as a three-phase AC generator. That is, when the ACG starter 233 functions as a starter motor, a<br><br>
current is supplied from the battery 38   to three starter coils 233a to thereby start rotation of the crankshaft 21a {see FIG. 1), whereas when the ACG starter 233 functions as an ACG (three-phase Ac generator), an output is taken from the starter coils 233a.  in the case that the ACG starter 233 is used as a starter motor, it is operated at a given battery voltage v3 or higher. [0043]<br>
The battery isolation relay 242 is composed of a switch  section  276  and" a coil 261   for operating the switch section 278.  The switch section 278 is composed of a fixed contact 276 connected to the main fuse 241 and a movable contact 277 adapted to come into contact with or separation from the fixed contact 276 and connected to the starter relay 243. When no current is supplied to the coil 281, the switch section 278 is off. [0044]<br>
The starter relay 243 is composed of a switch section 285 and a coil 286 for operating the switch section 285.  The switch section 285 is composed of a first fixed contact 282 connected to the battery isolation relay 242, a second fixed contact 283 connected to the battery 38, and a movable cohtact 284 adapted to . come into contact with or separation from one of the<br><br><br>
first and second fixed contacts 282 and 283 and connected to the boosting rectifier circuit 244.  The coil 286 operates to select the contact of the movable contact 284 and the first fixed contact 282 or the contact of the movable contact 284 and the second fixed contact 283. When no current is supplied to the coil 286, the movable contact 2 84 comes into contact with the first fixed contact 282, whereas when a current is supplied to the coil 286, the movable contact 284 comes into contact with the second fixed contact 283. [0045]<br>
The,boosting rectifier circuit 244 (power section) is composed of the FETs 245 to 250, diodes 291 to 296 as parasitic diodes each connected between the drain and the source of each of the FETs 245 to 250, respectively, and a capacitor 201 connected between output terminal portions 297 and 298.  The diodes 291 to 296 constitute a three-phase full-wave rectifier circuit, and the FETs 245 to 250 constitute a switch circuit for chopper.  When the ACG starter 233 operates as a starter, the switch circuit functions as a driver, whereas when the ACG starter 233 operates as an ACG, the switch circuit functions as a regulator. [0046]<br><br>
Each of the FETs 245 to 250 and the FETs 262 to 264 is a P-channel MOS FET {Field Effect Transistor), wherein a drain current flowing between the drain and the source is controlled by  a gate voltage applied between the gate and the source. [0047]<br>
The FET driving means 253 receives pulses from the oscillator 254 or the control means 255 and applies drive signals having rectangular waveforms to the gates of the FETs- 245 to 250 in synchronism with the frequency of the pulses. [0048]<br>
The oscillator 254 is started when the voltage supplied from the battery 38 or the ACG starter 233 becomes VI, and generates oscillation pulses having a given amplitude, a given pulse width, and a given pulse spacing.  That is, the oscillator 254 generates the oscillation pulses at the starting voltage VI or higher. [0049]<br>
The control means 255 controls the switching operation of the FETs 262 to 264 as switches, and includes a central processing unit (CPU) 255a (which will be hereinafter referred to as "CPU 255a") .  The CPU 255a includes a clock generator (not shown) for generating<br><br><br>
periodic pulses at given time intervals. [0050]<br>
The CPU 255a is started when the voltage supplied from the battery 38 or the ACG starter 233 becomes V2, and generates pulses (which will be hereinafter referred to as "CPU pulses") having a given amplitude, a given pulse width, and a given pulse spacing according to the pulses generated from the clock generator.  That is, the CPU 255a generates the CPU pulses at the starting voltage V2 or higher. [0051]<br>
The CPU 255a generates the CPU pulses for a given time period after starting.  However, when an ignition pulser signal from an ignition pulser signal generating device (not shown) is detected during this given time period, the CPU 255a continues to generate the CPU pulses also after this given time period until the engine speed becomes a given value or more or the battery voltage becomes a given value or more. When the engine speed lowers to a constant value or less or when the engine rotation is stopped, the generation of the CPU pulses is ended. [0052]<br>
The control means 255 controls the gate voltage at<br><br><br>
each of the FETs 262 to 264 to thereby perform on/off control between the drain and the source of each of the FETs 262 to 264.<br>
The control means 255 further generates a control signal for operating the CDI device 217 in the control device 70. [0053]<br>
The CDI device 217 is designed so that electricity is generated from an igniting coil (not shown) provided in the ACG starter 233, that this electricity is rectified by a diode and once accumulated by an igniting capacitor, and that an electrical signal is applied to the gate of a thyristor connected to the igniting capacitor in the off state of the thyristor, thereby turning on the thyristor to discharge the electric power accumulated in the igniting capacitor.  The discharged current is passed through a primary winding 207 of an ignition coil 206 to generate a high voltage at a secondary winding 208 and emit a spark at a spark plug 238. [0054]<br>
The first diode 256 functions to allow a current to flow in only a direction from the battery 38 toward the main switch 34 and to inhibit a current flow from the ACG<br><br><br>
starter 233 toward the battery 38.<br>
The second diode 257 functions to allow a current to flow in only a direction from the ACG starter 233 toward the main switch 34 and to inhibit a current flow from the battery 38 toward the ACG starter 233.<br>
Thus, the first and second diodes 256 and 257 are provided to pass a current having a fixed direction through the control means 255, thereby protecting the control means 255. [0055]<br>
The general load 261 is an electrical load except a fuel supply system load including the fuel pump 36 and an ignition system load including the CDI device 217 and the spark plug 238.  The general load 261 primarily includes the headlight 48, the stop lamp 57, the meter unit 40, and the horn 95 (see FIG. 1).<br>
The diodes 203 to 205 are parasitic diodes in the FETs 262 to 264, respectively. [0056]<br>
The boosting rectifier circuit 244, the FET driving means 253, the oscillator 254, and the control means 255 constitute a generation voltage boosting device 210. The FETs 262 to 264 and the control means 255 constitute a power control device 211.<br>
