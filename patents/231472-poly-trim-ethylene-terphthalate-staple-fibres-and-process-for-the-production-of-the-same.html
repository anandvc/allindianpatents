				<td>Poly (trimethylene terephthalate)<br>
PTT staple fibres, and process for the production thereof<br>
Description:<br>
The present invention relates to PTT staple fibres [where PTT equals<br>
poly(trimethylene terephthalate)] and to a process for the production thereof by a<br>
two-stage spinning and stretching process.<br>
Staple fibres made from polyethylene terephthalate and melt-spinning plants for<br>
their production are known (Fourné, Synthetische Fasern [Synthetic Fibres],<br>
Hanser Verlag [1995] pages 460-462). Owing to the different crystallization<br>
behaviour, these processes cannot readily be applied to PTT.<br>
Processes for the production of PTT continuous filaments have also been<br>
described. Thus, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A-1, Vol. 4, 1851-1857 (1966)<br>
mentions, inter alia, PTT fibres. The high stretching ratios specified indicate an<br>
uneconomically low spinning speed. The fibre properties listed do not meet<br>
today's market requirements.<br>
EP 0 547 553 A1 describes the production of monofilaments at a spinning speed of<br>
20 m/min and a production speed of 100 m/min.<br>
EP 0 754 790 A2 describes the production of textile filaments, inter alia from PTT,<br>
by means of heating surfaces heated to high temperatures as stretching aids. There<br>
are no specific working examples.<br>
WO 99/11845 A1 describes fibres made from PTT with a birefringence of at least<br>
0.030. The parameters given indicate low elongation at break values of ≤90%,<br>
which do not facilitate a stretching ratio that is sufficiently high for further<br>
conversion into staple fibres and are therefore unsuitable.<br>
WO 99-27168 Al discloses a high-speed spin-stretch process for the production of<br>
PTT filaments which are wound onto yarn spools. High throughputs and tow<br>
baling for the production of staple fibres cannot be derived therefrom.<br><br>
CA 86:122866 regarding JP 52-08124 A relates to the treatment of PTT<br>
multifilaments with heating devices, where the stretching ratio of 33% to be<br>
applied is unsuitable for the production of staple fibres.<br>
CA 86:122865 regarding JP 52-08123 A describes the use of a high stretching ratio<br>
of 300%, which is desired per se, in the production of PTT fibres. However, the<br>
spinning speed of 360 m/min which is practised to this end is so low that the<br>
economic efficiency of the process is put in doubt.<br>
CA 86:122856 regarding JP 52-05320 A describes the spinning of PTT, where the<br>
stretching ratio practised indicates uneconomically low spinning speeds.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide PTT staple fibres, where these and<br>
the textiles and home textiles, in particular carpets, produced therefrom should<br>
have a high aesthetic level and service quality compared with conventional fibres<br>
and should have environmentally friendly dyeing properties. These PTT staple<br>
fibres should be produced in a two-stage process of melt spinning and stretching<br>
which has higher economic efficiency than the above-mentioned processes for<br>
continuous filaments.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by PTT staple fibres and<br>
by a process for the production of ITT staple fibres having an intrinsic viscosity of<br>
at least 0.70 dl/g equivalent description should be provided in stead of ref to claims<br>
The term PTT here is taken to mean a polyester comprising at least 90 mol% of<br>
trimethylene terephthalate units. Suitable comonomers are isophthalic acid, 2,6-<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol<br>
and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. Preference is given to poly(trimethylene<br>
terephthalate) homopolymer, particularly preferably with a low proportion of ether<br>
groups derived from 1,3-propanediol which are formed during the production<br>
process. The intrinsic viscosity of the PTT staple fibres is in the range from 0.7 to<br>
1.3 dl/g and particularly preferably from 0.75 to 1.15 dl/g.<br>
The process commences from PTT melt, which is either taken directly from the<br>
polycondensation reactor in the preparation of PTT or is obtained by melting PTT<br>
granules. The polymer melt may ccmprise conventional additives, such as dyes,<br>
matting agents, stabilisers, antistatics, lubricants and branching agents, in total<br>
amounts of from 0 to 5.0% by weight, or the additives can be added to the melt on<br><br>
its way to the spinnerets. Additives which significantly affect structural parameters<br>
(for example elongation at break of the strand) are excluded.<br>
In accordance with the invention, PTT staple fibres are produced, preferably with a<br>
titre of from 0.8 to 20 den, by a two-stage spinning and stretching process which<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
1.	The PTT melt, having a poiymer melting point Tm, is fed to the spinning<br>
system at a melt temperature Ts = Tm + k (°C), where 7 ≤ k ≤ 63, preferably<br>
23 ≤ k ≤ 41. The transport and distribution of the melt as far as the spinning<br>
beam take place here in jacketed product lines, which are heated with liquid<br>
and/or vapour-form heat transfer medium in the outer jacket of the lines at a<br>
temperature in the range from 234 to 290°C. Other types of heating are<br>
possible. The wall shear rate s of the melt in the line system are from 2 to<br>
128 sec-1, preferably from 3.5 to 16:sec-1 in the pipelines and from 12 to<br>
128 sec-1 in static mixing elenents installed within certain line sections. The<br>
shear rate y here is defined by the empty pipe shear rate times the mixer<br>
factor m, where the mixer factor is a characteristic parameter of the mixer<br>
type and is about 3.5-4 for Salzer SMXL models. The shear rate y in sec" is<br>
calculated from<br><br>
where G = polymer transport rate (g/min),<br>
δ = nominal density of the polymer (g/cm3),<br>
R = empty pipe radius [mm].<br>
The mean residence time of the melt in the product line as far as entry into<br>
the spinning beam is a maximum of 30 minutes, preferably a maximum of 25<br>
minutes. The line temperatune T1 is preferably set within the above limits in<br>
such a way that it is in the range T1 = Ts ± 15°C. The product line optionally<br>
includes at least one booster pump, at least one polymer filter, at least one<br>
polymer heat exchanger and at least one shut-off and distribution valve.<br>
2.	In the spinning beam, the PTT melt is led to at least one spinning pump, fed<br>
at a constant transport rate, set through the choice of the pump speed, to at<br>
least one spin pack by means of the pressure built up by the pump and forced<br><br>
through distributor devices, filter and shear media within the spin pack and<br>
spun through the holes of the spinneret plate to give melt strands. The<br>
spinneret holes may be circular or designed in any desired other geometry.<br>
The spin pack can be inserted into the spinning beam from below and can<br>
have a cylindrical geometry, with the holes in the spinneret plate being<br>
distributed symmetrically over an annular area.<br>
The spinneret plates have a hole density of from 0.3 to 20 holes/cm2. The<br>
spinneret hole diameter D is selected as a function of the hole throughput in<br>
accordance with<br><br>
where ζ is the density of the melt and, for homo-PTT, is 1.11 g/cm3.<br>
The flow rate F per spinne-et hole, based on the fibre titre, is in the range<br>
F(g/min)/titre(dtex) = (0.14 to 0.66).<br>
The residence time of the melt in the spin pack is at most 4 minutes. The<br>
spinning draft is selected between 1:30 and 1:160 and is determined in a<br>
known manner from the ratio of the take-off rate to the injection rate at the<br>
spinneret holes.<br>
The heating of the spinning beam is selected in the range 234-290°C in such<br>
a way that the following relationship applies:<br>
TB (°C) = Ts + dTw + 4/100 • dp(bar) ± 15, where dTw = change in the melt<br>
temperature in the heat exchanger, which is set positive for heating and<br>
negative for cooling and is equal to 0 in the case of plants with no heat<br>
exchanger, dp(bar) = total pressure drop of the melt as far as the exit from the<br>
spinneret plate.<br>
3. The melt strands are cooled by means of turbulence-free cooling air at a<br>
temperature between 5 and 25°C, preferably from 8 to 18°C, flowing in<br>
perpendicularly to the strand running direction. The mean outflow speed of<br>
the cooling air from the rectifier is from 0.5 to 2.0 m/sec. The blow zone<br>
lengths are between 50 and 2000 mm, preferably from 150 to 600 mm, in the<br><br>
case of cooling-air systems which are concentric to the strand run (radial<br>
blowing) and from 500 to 2000 mm in the case of blow shafts with cross-<br>
flow blowing, and particularly preferably 150-300 mm for fibre titres<br>
≤ 5 den/filament and from 300 to 600 mm for 12-20 den/filament.<br>
4.	The cooled strands are finished with an oil-water mixture. The amount of<br>
water on the strands is adjusted to between 12 and 30% by weight, preferably<br>
from 18 to 25%.<br>
Immediately or shortly thereafter, the filaments from a spinning position are<br>
gathered together to form a filament bundle. The filament bundles from the<br>
individual positions are subsequently combined to form a spun tow,<br>
preferably at the spinning wall. The spun tow is taken off at speeds in the<br>
range from 600 to 2000 m/min by means of a take-off unit, and the spun tow<br>
is then deposited in a can.<br>
5.	The cans are placed together to form a creel in a creel chamber held at a<br>
temperature of from 15°C to 35°C, preferably from 20°C to 27°C, and fed to<br>
a fibre drawing frame. The spun tow from the cans is taken off via a feed<br>
unit, after which at least one full tow is formed from individual spun tows by<br>
means of a comb.<br>
The full tows are stretched in at least one stretching stage, optionally with<br>
supply of a temperature-controlled oil/water mixture. A temperature in the<br>
range 20-100°C should be maintained here. The stretching ratio (SR) is<br>
selected in accordance with the strand elongation Rd in such a way that<br>
SR(%) = 1 + α • Rd/100, where α = 0.25 to 0.75, with relatively small a<br>
values being preferred for large titres and relatively large α values being<br>
preferred for smaller titres.<br>
This is then optionally followed, depending on the maximum temperature of<br>
210°C used, by heat setting and relaxation in at least one stage. The<br>
stretching, heat setting and relaxation are carried out at speeds of from 25 to<br>
400 m/min.<br>
The discharge speed from the relaxation zone is preferably at least 90 m/min,<br>
particularly preferably 180 m/min, at titres ≤ 5 dtex.<br><br>
The cooling of the full tow to below the glass transition temperature is<br>
preferably carried out using an oil/water mixture or using pure water.<br>
6. The individual tows are subsequently laid together to form at least one tow ,<br>
and each tow is fed to a stuffer box crimping machine. Post-softening using<br>
an oil/water mixture and/or steam treatment of the tow as crimping aid is<br>
optionally carried out. The subsequent drying of the tow in at least one dryer<br>
stage is carried out with residence times of from 0.5 to 10 minutes at<br>
temperatures of from 30 to 200°C, preferably from 60 to 165°C. The<br>
resultant tow(s) can subsequently be cut to a staple length of preferably<br>
between 6 and 200 mm. Alternatively, it is possible for the tow(s) to be<br>
packed and converted into staple fibres later in a separate operation.<br>
In this way, PTT staple fibres are obtained which have a novel, hitherto<br>
unknown combination of properties for staple fibres which are evident as<br>
follows: high permanent elasticity and bulk of the fibres, a novel combination<br>
of high viscosity together with the mechanical parameters described by the<br>
stress-strain diagram, of modulus values and thermal shrinkage stability, with<br>
dyeing with dispersion dyes being possible without addition of carrier/dye<br>
absorption aids, and the fibres having permanently stain-repellent properties.<br>
Characteristic features of the PTT staple fibres according to the invention are<br>
an LASE value at 10% elongation of from 5 to 12 cN/tex, a secant modulus<br>
at an elongation value = elongation at break minus 45% (but at least 5%) of<br>
less than 1.0 cN/tex per 1% change in elongation, and a crimp stability of<br>
greater than 75%. This combination of properties results in extremely<br>
desirable aesthetics and seivice quality compared with conventional fibres.<br>
The dyeing properties resull in considerably better environmental friendliness<br>
of the post-processing process. The areas of application are to be regarded as<br>
being in textiles and home textiles, in particular carpets.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to examples<br>
without the invention being restricted to these working examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
PTT chips having an 1.V. of 0.91 dl/g, a melting point TM = 227°C and a water<br>
content of 20 ppm were melted in an extruder to give a melt at 255°C, and this<br>
melt was forced through a product line at the same temperature into a spinning<br><br>
system. Three SMXL mixers from Sulzer, Switzerland, were installed in the<br>
product line, with the shear rate in the mixers being 28 sec-1 at a polymer<br>
throughput of 2500 g/min. The line diameter was selected so that the shear rate in<br>
the free line was 7.9 sec-1. The mean residence time in the product line was about 3<br>
minutes.<br>
The spinning of the PTT melt was carried out in a BN 100 spinning system from<br>
Lurgi Zimmer AG with annular spinneret and radial cooling shaft. The hole<br>
density of the spinneret plate was 6.3 holes/cm2. The spinning beam temperature<br>
was 256°C, with the total pressure drop of the melt as far as the exit from the<br>
spinneret being 140 bar. Heat exchangers were not installed. The residence time in<br>
the spin pack was about 0.5 minute.<br>
The melt strands emerging from the spinneret plate were cooled by means of<br>
cooling air fed radially from the outside inward at a rate of 1400 Nm3/h and with a<br>
temperature of 8°C. The solidified strands were brought into contact with an oiling<br>
ring at a distance of 850 mm from the lower side of the spinneret plate and treated<br>
with a water/oil mixture in such a way that the amount of water on the strands was<br>
about 25% by weight and very stable strand running resulted. The spinning take-<br>
off speed was 900 m/min. After being taken off, the strands were deposited in<br>
spinning cans in the form of spun tows by means of a reeling machine.<br>
The separate stretching of the span tows in a fibre drawing frame was carried out<br>
in two stages. The spun tows were subsequently heat-set with slight relaxation,<br>
cooled, crimped, dried and cut to give staple fibres. The production speed in the<br>
fibre drawing frame, corresponding to the speed of the roller at the exit from the<br>
final stretching zone, was 100 m/min.<br>
Further process parameters and the textile properties of the staple fibres are shown<br>
in the table. It should be noted that the spinning titre measured may differ by up to<br>
± 5% compared with the theoretical value due to uncertainties in the measurement,<br>
relaxation in the can or a water/oil coating. It was possible to dye the staple fibres<br>
with dispersion dyes, such as Terasil Navy Blue GRL/C from Ciba/CH at 95°C<br>
without addition of carrier/dye absorption aids.<br>
The intrinsic viscosities (I.V.) v/ere measured on a solution of 0.5 g of PTT in<br>
100 ml of a mixture of phenol and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (3:2 parts by weight) at<br>
25°C.<br><br>
The melting point and glass transition temperature were determined by DSC at a<br>
heating rate of 10°C/min after the sample had firstly been melted briefly and<br>
immediately quenched again.<br>
The titre and stress-strain properties of the fibres were determined using the<br>
Vibrotex and Vibrodyn instrument set from Lenzing, Austria. The clamped length<br>
was 20 mm, the pre-tensioning weight, depending on the titre, was 100 mg/dtex,<br>
and the test speed was 20 mm/min.<br>
It was possible to take the LASE (load at specific elongation) values directly from<br>
the evaluation instrument by input of the reference elongations. The secant<br>
modulus was determined by applying a secant with the elongation value =<br>
(elongation at break minus 45%), but at least 5%, and the slope of these straight<br>
lines was evaluated in (cN/tex) in respect of a 1% change in elongation.<br>
The hot-air shrinkage was determined in a heating cabinet during temperature<br>
treatment at 180°C over a residence time of 20 minutes without pretensioning of<br>
the fibres.<br>
The crimp curves were counted visually. The crimping values were determined<br>
using the Vibrotex method and instrument from Lenzing/AT.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Staple fibres were produced in carpet quality with a titre of 17 dtex as described in<br>
Example 1, but taking into account the parameters shown in the table, and the<br>
results are listed in the table.<br>
The fibres were distinguished by excellent bulking and crimp-recovery behaviour.<br><br><br><br><br>
The process described also enables the production of other titres, in particular finer<br>
titres, such as microfilaments of up to 0.8 den. The titre can thus be reduced by<br>
means familiar to the person skilled in the art by reducing the melt throughput<br>
through the spinneret or increasing the number of spinneret holes with constant<br>
throughput.<br><br>
