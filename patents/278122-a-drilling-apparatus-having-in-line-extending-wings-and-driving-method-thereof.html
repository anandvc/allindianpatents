				<td>ADRttUNG APPARATUS HAVING IN-LINE EXTENDING WINGS AND DRIVING<br>
METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a borehole drilling apparatus having in-line extending wings<br>
and driving method thereof, in particular to a borehole dtilh^ apparatus rmvirig in-line extending wings,<br>
which comprises a guide device operated by high pressure air, extending wings and a pilot bit, fee<br>
extending wings being configuted to advance and retract in an in-line manner so as to extend fee<br>
diameter of a borehole so feat sludge can be prevented from being accumulated in fee space to which<br>
fee extending wings return, and a driving method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, hammer bit equipment used in drilling a rxnsk)kinduo a rotation apparatus, a<br>
striking apparatus and a drilling apparatus. The present invention is directed to fee drilling apparatus<br>
located at fee lowest portion of fee hammer bit equipments. The drilling apparatus can be divided into<br>
an eccentric type, an extending type and a blade extending type dependmg cm mearis for extending fee<br>
diameter of fee borehole, for instance, fee structure of a reamer, extending blades or arms.<br>
As disclosed in US Patent No. 4,770,259 (Published on Sep. 13,1988), fee eccentric type<br>
drilringapparatairidiiateadriUstri^<br>
string. Further, the cutting device consists of an r^frmp^a^. portion rotating within the ffri)] string and<br>
an outer surface. Also, a reamer is installed in fee intermediate portion so that it is offeet wife regard to<br>
fee center axis. Accordingly, fee reamer extends fee diameter of fee rwrebole by ecceaitric rotation in fee<br>
eccentric type drilling apparatus.<br>
In addition, as shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2710192(published on<br>
Nov. 29, 1994), fee extending type drilling apparatus comprises a device driven by means of an air<br>
pomp, a bit device installed at a distal end of the device, and an extending blade installed between the<br>
device and 1he bit device. The extending blade is secured at an upper end to the device by means of a<br>
pin so that it can move angularly in the vertical direction, and the upper end portion of the bit device is<br>
formed to have an inclined surface. Therefore, the lower end portion of the extending blade is<br>
configured to diverge along the inclined surface of the bit device when me device and the bit device<br>
come close to each other<br>
Further, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,787,999(issued on Aug. 4,1998), the blade extending<br>
type drilling apparatus includes a driver, under-reameraons, and a pilot bit, in which a plurality of arms<br>
are constructed to project and retract while rotating from me center of the pilot bit to the inclined<br>
direction by means of arotation force of the driver.<br>
However, with regard to the eccentric type drilling apparatus, it is impossible to carry out rapid<br>
drfllmg work as the reamer rotates eccen<br>
intermediate portion is liable to be damaged easily under high load. Also, with regard to the extending<br>
type drilling apparatus, it is impossible to use it under high load as the extending blade is extended with<br>
fa angular movement tn thp IcmgfriiHinal direction, and the fixing pin is apt to be damaged easily.<br>
Further, in contrast to the eccentric or extending type drilling apparatus, although the blade<br>
extending type drilling apparatus can be used for high load drilling apparatus, there is a problem in that<br>
the contact portion between the arms and fee pilot bit is susceptible to serious abrasion because the<br>
rotation force of the driver should spread the arms forcibly and rotate even the pilot bit via the arms at<br>
tie same time, and the securing pin for fixing the arms are damaged fiequently. Additionally, when-the<br>
arms return to their original positions after the completion of the drilling work, sludge is liable to be<br>
jammed in the space where 1he arms return to thereby hinder fteanns'relum to merr original positions,<br>
so that it becomes somewhat difficult to retract the drilling apparatus from the casing to fit into the<br>
borehole.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Hie present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the<br>
conventional striking type borehole drilling apparatus, and it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a borehole drilling apparatus of an improved structure,, in which it is possible to perform a<br>
drilling work under a high load and at a high speed, it is easy to spread and return the eximiiiig wings,<br>
the working efficiency is excellent as the sludge is not accumulated in the space where the extending<br>
wings return, and it is possible to significantly reduce the maintenance and repair costs.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
To accomplish the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a borehole drilling apparatus and driving method thereof, wherein the borehole drilling<br>
apparatus comprises a guide device rotating wife moving up and down in a casing to fit into the<br>
borehole, extending wings for extending the diameters of the drilled holes, and a pilot bit installed at a<br>
lower portion of tie guide device to strike the bottom ofthe borehole, wherein spiral projections formed<br>
at a lower surface of Ihe guide device slidably engage with guide grooves formed at sides of the<br>
extending wings to each other, and a window is formed at a side of fee pilot bit for advancing and<br>
retracting foe extending wings so that they can spread ard return hneariynxim the caiter of the jotbk<br>
In the present invention, as described above, the term of "In-line" driving manner refers to a<br>
manner in which the extending wings spread from each other linearly from the center of the pilot bit,<br>
andtneyretumto come close to each other linearly.<br>

instance, the pin support rod 460 pushes out the seoirirjg pin 450 so that it can be engaged wim the pin<br>
retaining groove 360 of the pilot bit 300 to thereby damp the guide device 100 and the pilot bit 300 to<br>
each other.<br>
The in-line driving method of tie borehole drilling apparatus of Ihe present invention wfll now<br>
be described below. FIG 10 and FIG 11 are views for explaining the driving principle of the drilling;<br>
apparatus in which two extending wings 200 are arranged linearly side by side according to an<br>
embodiment of Hie present invention.<br>
At first, as shown in FIG 10, the guide device 100 (represented by 1hick solid line) rotates<br>
clockwise to descend with the pilot bit 300 in a state where the extending wings 200 (represented by<br>
dotted thick line) are received wiftlin the pilot bit 300 (represented by 1bin solid line). When the lower<br>
surface of the pilot bit 300 begins to strike a bottom surface of the borehole, rotation of the pilot bit 300<br>
will be suppressed by the fiictional force, and ifthe guide device 100 arfnues to rotate atfe state, the<br>
spiral projections 131 (represented by a dotted portion) rotates along the guide groove 210 (represented<br>
by reverse inclined lines) of the extending wing 200 in the direction enlarging radius to spread and<br>
extend the extending wings 200 to the outside ofthe wing advancing and redactirigwiridcnvSlO. In this<br>
instance, the extending wing 200 is spread and extended lineariy away frcm the center of tepUot bit<br>
300 via the advancing and retracting window 310.<br>
Then, as shown inHG 11, when the retaining protrusion 132 of the glide device 100 contacts<br>
the retaining step 320 (shown by inclined lines), spreadmg of the extendbg wdrj^ 200 is stop<br>
rotation force of tie guide device 100 is transmitted to the pttot bit 300 itself to rotate Ihe guide device<br>
100, the extending wing 200 and Ihe pilot bit 300 integrally to cany out the drilling work Sludge such<br>
as pebbles, sands and so on produced during the drilling work can be discharged \ia fee sludge<br>
discharge hole 30 by means of fee compressed air supplied from the air hole 20.<br>
Meanwhile, Ihe return process of the extending wing 200 for 1he borehole begins with reverse<br>
rotation and ascending of 1he guide device 100. In olher words, as shown in HG 11, when the guide<br>
device 100 rotates counter-clockwise to ascend in a state where 1be extending wings 200 are spread, 1he<br>
stepped surface 220 of the extending wings 200 contacts with the lower end of a shoe 12 in the casing<br>
10, and the rotation of the extending wing 200 tor the borehole is suppressed by the fiictional force. At<br>
this state, if the guide device continues to rotate reversely, the spiral projections 131 (represented by a<br>
dotted portion) move along the guide groove 210 of Ihe extending wing 200 in Has direction decreasing<br>
the radius to thereby return the extending wings 200 into the window 310 of the pilot bit 300. In this<br>
instance, the extending wings 200 return linearly to come close each other to the center of the pilot bit<br>
300 via the advancing and retracting window 310 for the wings.<br>
When the guide device 100 rotates reversely to contact with the retaining step 320 (shown by<br>
inclined solid lines), as shown in FIG ll.the extending wings 200 finish returning, atulfee guide device<br>
100, the extending wings 200 and the pilot bit 300 rancurranflyrotatetoretactfirantiie casing 10.<br>
In the present invention, although it is preferable that two extending wings 200 are installed at<br>
both side as described in the above embodiment, three extending wngs may be installed, if desired In<br>
case of installing three extending wings 200, tie driving principle is basically the same as that of<br>
installing two extending wings. However, the spiral projections 131 of the guide device 100 and the<br>
wing advancing and retracting window 310 of tie pilot bit 300 should be installed to be three so feat<br>
they can cope with three extending wings 200.<br>
While tie present invention has been described wife reference to fee pnrferred embodiments,<br>
the present invention is not restricted by the embodiments. It is to be appreciated th&amp;<br>
art can change or modify tie embodiments without departing fiom 1he scope and spirit of the present<br>
invention. However, such variations and TnnrlificatinTis are all pertained to the scope of tie present<br>
invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, according to the borehole drilling appai^is of trie present invention, it is<br>
possible to cany out high load and high speed drilling work because tbs extending wings advance and<br>
retract in an in-line manner, and in particular, the sludge is not aoamulated at the position where fee<br>
extending wings advance and retract<br>
Also,itispo&amp;sible to signifitantyreduceaworkiiigpmodiequiiedto finish fee drilling of fee<br>
borehole, considering that the conventional drilling apparatus has frequently stop operation and has<br>
been susceptible to disorder due to accumulation of the sludge.<br>
In particular, when the sludge is accumulated between the extending wings to thereby block<br>
smooth returning of 1fae extending wings, 1he whole drilling apparatus cannot be retracted fiom the<br>
borehole and it should be discarded, therefore, according to teraesentirivention, it is possible to esq)ect<br>
a reduction of the costs caused by the lost of the equipments.<br>

5. A driving method of a borehole drilling apparatus comprising: a guide device, wings for<br>
extending a borehole and a pilot bit, the driving method comprises the steps of.<br>
suppressing the rotation of the pilot bit by the fiictional force produced when the extending<br>
wings rotate and descend integrally with the guide device in a state where the extending wings are<br>
received in the pilot bit, and then a bottom surface of the pilot bit begins to strike a botom surface of the<br>
borehole;<br>
spreading the extending wings outwardly from a wing advancing and retracting window<br>
formed at a side of the pilot bit by the movement of the spiral projections formed at a lower surface of<br>
the guide device along guide grooves formed at a side of the extending wings in the direction increasing<br>
radii of the spiral projections by the roiatioa force of the guide device, when the guide device continues<br>
to rotate in a state where the rotation of the pilot bit is suppressed;<br>
drillingthe borehole with the integral rotation of tine guide device, the extending wings and the<br>
plot bit, after the stop of the spread of the extending wings whoa an retaining trolruaonfomjed on the<br>
outer cncuraference of fee guide device is caught by aretaining step formed atthe inner rarcumferential<br>
surface of the pilot bit;<br>
suppressing the rotation of the extending wings by the fiicaonal force produced when upper<br>
surfaces of the extending wings comes into contact wife a shoe of the rasing to fit into the borehole,<br>
after the guide device rotates reversely and ascends atthe state of spread of the extend^ wings;<br>
returning the extending wings into 1he wing advaricing and exfflacti^<br>
by the movement of the spiral projections of 1he guide device along the guide grooves of "the extending<br>
wings in the direction decreasing radii of 1he spiral projections by the roianonibrce ofthe guide device,<br>
when the guide device continues to rotate reversely in a state where fceioladancf tine extemSngwirigE<br>
are suppressed; and<br>
retracting the guide device, the extending wings and the pilot bit fiom the casing while<br>
integrally rotating them after the stopping of tie return ofthe extending wings, when the retaining<br>
protmsian farmed an the outer circumference of the guide device contacts with the retaining step<br>
ibrmed atthe inner circumferential surface ofthe pilot bit.<br>
