				<td>This invention relates to a process for derivatisation of copolymers that are useful in the preparation of chromalography supports. The invention more particularly relates to a process for the derivatisation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers useful as affinity chromalography supports for purification of enzymes such as penicillin G acylase.<br>
Penicillin G acylase finds applications as a biocatalyst in the preparation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and 7-amino dcsacctoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA). 6-APA and 7-ADCA are further processed for the production of semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins those are potent antimicrobial agents. These applications arc developed due to absolute specificity of penicillin G acylase in hydrolysing linear amide bond present in penicillins and cephalosporins to form corresponding beta-lactam nuclei.<br>
Penicillin G acylase is used as an immobilized enzyme preparation. The protocol for preparation of immobilised penicillin G acylase constitutes fermentation of a microorganism producing penicillin G acylase (usualy Escherichia coli), extraction of the penicillin G acylase from the cells into aqueous extract, purification of the penicillin G acylase and immobilisation of Ihe purified enzyme onto a solid support. The specific activity of the immobilised penicillin G acylase is determined by the degree of purity of the enzyme used for immobilisation. Thus, purification of penicillin G acylase is an important operation in the production of immobilised penicillin G acylase.<br><br>
Different protocols are developed for purification of penicillin G acylase involves use of ion exchange, hydrophobia interactions and/or affinity chromatography either individually or in various combinations as described in Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology vol.9, p. 573, 1984. Sepharose (agarose) activated with cyanogen bromide and derivatised with some amino acids, aromatic amines, aliphatic amines, ampicillin and amoxycillin are used for purification of penicillin G acylase as described in Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, vol. 9, p. 421, 1984; Biotechnology Letters, vol. 9, p. 539, 1987 and Hindustan Antibiotics Bulletin, vol. 31, p. 25, 1989.<br>
These protocols for purification of penicillin G acylase suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages; use of column chromatography procedures, bed compression, attrition of the chromatography support when used in batch mode.<br>
The use of reactive dyes as a ligand for immobilization offers the advantage of Ihe ability of the dye to bind to the active site of an enzyme by virtue of its similarity to naturally occurring substrate.<br>
In our copending application No. — we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers.<br>
In our another copending application No. NF 322/2000 —, we have described and claimed a<br>
process for the derivatization of macroporous beaded crosslinked allyl glycidyl ether copolymers useful as affinity supports for purification of penicillin G acylase.<br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a process for the purification of penicillin G acylase from enzyme extract of Escherichia coli using derivatised macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers by using synthetic dye as the ligand.<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop a process, which is simple, rapid and does not involve many steps.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process by which purified penicillin G acylase preparation is useful for its immobilisation onto the solid supports prepared as per the process of this invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the derivatisation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers winch comprises suspending macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers in water at a temperature in the range of 50 to 60"C, adding a solution of synthetic dye solution while maintaining the contents at the same temperature in the in presence of an alkali metal chloride, adding a base such as alkaline metal carbonate, continuing the reaction at a temperature in the range of 60 to 80°C for a period ranging from 2 to 4 hours, isolating the beads by conventional methods and washing the derivatized beads with water and drying.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers were prepared as described and claimed in our copending application No. — ' L'<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the synthetic dye used is selected from<br><br>
cibacron blue, basilcn blue, reactive green, reactive red.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the alkali metal chloride used is such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the alkali metal carbonate used is such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate.<br>
