				<td>CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which elevate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with reduced PDH activity, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the elevation of PDH activity in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Within tissues adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides the energy for synthesis of complex molecules and, in muscle, for contraction. ATP is generated from the breakdown of energy-rich substrates such as glucose or long chain free fatty acids. In oxidative tissues such as muscle the majority of the ATP is generated from acetyl Co A which enters the citric acid cycle, thus the supply of acetyl CoA is a critical determinant of ATP production in oxidative tissues. Acetyl CoA is produced either by p-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of glucose metabolism by the glycolytic pathway. The key regulatory enzyme in controlling the rate of acetyl CoA formation from glucose is PDH which catalyses the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and carbon dioxide with concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.<br>
In disease states such as both non-insulin dependent (NIDDM) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), oxidation of lipids is increased with a concomitant reduction in utilisation of glucose, which contributes to the hyperglycaemia. Reduced glucose utilisation in both IDDM and NIDDM is associated with a reduction in PDH activity. In addition, a further consequence of reduced PDH activity may be that an increase in pyruvate concentration results in increased availability of lactate as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis. It is reasonable to expect that increasing the activity of PDH could increase the rate of glucose oxidation and hence overall glucose utilisation, in addition to reducing hepatic glucose output. Another factor contributing to diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion, which has been shown to be associated with reduced PDH activity in pancreatic ß-cells (in a rodent genetic model of diabetes mellitus Zhou et al. (1996) Diabetes 45: 580-586).<br>
Oxidation of glucose is capable of yielding more molecules of ATP per mole of oxygen than is oxidation of fatty acids. In conditions where energy demand may exceed energy supply, such as myocardial ischaemia, intermittent claudication, cerebral ischaemia<br><br>
and reperfusion, (Zaidan et al, 1998; J. Neurochem. 70: 233-241), shifting the balance of substrate utilisation in favour of glucose metabolism by elevating PDH activity may be expected to improve the ability to maintain ATP levels and hence function.<br>
An agent which is capable of elevating PDH activity may also be expected to be of benefit in treating conditions where an excess of circulating lactic acid is manifest such as in certain cases of sepsis.<br>
The agent dichloroacetic acid (DCA) which increases the activity of PDH after acute administration in animals, (Vary et al., 1988; Circ. Shock, 24: 3-18), has been shown to have the predicted effects in reducing glycaemia, (Stacpoole et al., 1978; N. Engl. J. Med. 298: 526-530), and as a therapy for myocardial ischaemia (Bersin and Stacpoole 1997; American Heart Journal, 134: 841-855) and lactic acidaemia, (Stacpoole et al., 1983; N. Engl. J. Med. 309: 390-396).<br>
PDH is an intramitochondrial multienzyme complex consisting of multiple copies of several subunits including three enzyme activities El, E2 and E3, required for the completion of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (Patel and Roche 1990; FASEB J., 4: 3224-3233). El catalyses the non-reversible removal of CO2 from pyruvate; E2 forms acetyl CoA and E3 reduces NAD to NADH. Two additional enzyme activities are associated with the complex: a specific kinase which is capable of phosphorylating El at three serine residues and a loosely-associated specific phosphatase which reverses the phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of a single one of the three serine residues renders the El inactive. The proportion of the PDH in its active (dephosphorylated) state is determined by a balance between the activity of the kinase and phosphatase. The activity of the kinase may be regulated in vivo by the relative concentrations of metabolic substrates such as NAD/NADH, CoA/acetylCoA and adenine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP as well as by the availability of pyruvate itself.<br>
European Patent Publication Nos. 617010 and 524781 describes compounds which are capable of relaxing bladder smooth muscle and which may be used in the treatment of urge incontinence. We have found that the compounds of the present invention are very good at elevating PDH activity, a property nowhere disclosed in EP 0617010 and EP 524781.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that certain compounds elevate PDH activity, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with disorders of glucose utilisation such as diabetes mellitus, pbesity, (Curto et al., 1997; Int. J.<br>
Obes. 21 : 1 137-1 142), and lactic acidaemia. Additionally the compounds may be expected to have utility in diseases where supply of energy-rich substrates to tissues is limiting such as peripheral vascular disease, (including intermittent claudication), cardiac failure and certain cardiac myopathies, muscle weakness, hyperlipidaemias and atherosclerosis (Stacpoole et al., 1978; N. Engl. J. Med. 298: 526-530). A compound that activates PDH may also be useful in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) (J Neural Transm (1998) 105, 855-870).<br>

According to a further feature of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula (!') using any one of processes a), i), g), h), i) or 1); and thereafter if necessary: i) converting a compound of the formula (F) into another compound of the formula (I1);<br><br>
ii) removing any protecting groups; or<br>
iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo cleavable ester.<br>
It is noted that many of the starting materials for synthetic methods as described above are commercially available and/or widely reported in the scientific literature, or could be made from commercially available compounds using adaptations of processes reported in the scientific literature.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or /-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with<br>
a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a phenol is, for example, an alkylether, for example, methyl, a silyl ether, for example, trimethylsilyl ether or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether, an oxyalkylether, for example, methoxymethyl ether or methoxyethoxymethyl ether or an ester, for example acetate or benzoate. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an alkylether may be removed by treatment with a suitable reagent such as iodotrimethylsilane or a suitable Lewis acid such as borontribromide. Alternatively a silyl ether may be removed by acid- or fluoride ion- catalysed hydrolysis. Alternatively oxyalkylethers may be removed by treatment with a suitable acid such as acetic acid or hydrochloric acid. Alternatively esters may be removed by hydrolysis by a suitable acid or a suitable base.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
In cases where compounds of formula (I) are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable acid or basic salts, administration of the compound as a salt may be appropriate, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be made by conventional methods such as those described following. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiologically acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulphonate, acetate, tartrate, citrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and a-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed such as sulphate, nitrate, and hydrochloride.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound of formula (I) (or its<br>
ester) with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. It is also possible with most compounds of the invention to make a corresponding alkali metal (e.g., sodium, potassium, or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (e.g., calcium) salt by treating a compound of formula (I) (and in some cases the ester) with one equivalent of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g. the ethoxide or methoxide in aqueous medium followed by conventional purification techniques.<br>
In vivo cleavable esters of compounds of the invention may be made by coupling with a pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid or an activated derivative thereof. For example, the coupling may be carried out by treating a compound of formula (I) with an appropriate acid chloride (for example, acetyl chloride, propionyl chloride, or benzoyl chloride) or acid anhydride (for example, acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, or benzoic anhydride) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other suitable carboxylic acids (including their activated derivatives) for the formation of in vivo cleavable esters are known to the art and these are also intended to be included within the scope of the invention. Catalysts such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine may also be usefully employed.<br>
Many of the intermediates defined herein are novel and these are provided as a further feature of the invention.<br>
The identification of compounds which elevate PDH activity is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In vitro elevation of PDH activity<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to elevate PDH activity. cDNA encoding PDH kinase may be obtained by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and subsequent cloning. This may be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with PDH kinase activity. For example rat PDHkinasell (rPDHKII) obtained by expression of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli (E. Coli), was found to display PDH kinase activity.<br>
In the case of the rPDHKII (Genbank accession number U10357) a 1.3kb fragment encoding the protein was isolated by PCR from rat liver cDNA and cloned into a vector (for example pQE32 - Quiagen Ltd.). The recombinant construct was transformed into E. coli (for example M15pRep4 - Quiagen Ltd.). Recombinant clones were identified, plasmid DNA was<br>
isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. One clone which had the expected nucleic acid sequence was selected for the expression work. Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the expression of recombinant proteins in bacterial systems can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press. Other known PDH kinases for use in assays, may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of rPDHKII activity, E. coli strain M15pRep4 cells were transformed with the pQE32 vector containing rPDHKII cDNA. This vector incorporates a 6-His tag onto the protein at its N-terminus. E. coli were grown to an optical density of 0.6 (600 nM) and protein expression was induced by the addition of 10 uM isopropylthio-p-galactosidase. Cells were grown for 18 hours at 18°C and harvested by centrifugation. The resuspended cell paste was lysed by homogenisation and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 24000xg for 1 hour. The 6-His tagged protein was removed from the supernatant using a nickel chelating nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA: Quiagen Ltd.) matrix (Quiagen) which was washed with 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminornethane-hydrogen chloride, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 M sodium chloride pH 8.0, prior to elution of bound protein using a buffer containing 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrogen chloride, 200 mM imidazole, 0.15 M sodium chloride pH 8.0. Eluted fractions containing 6-His protein were pooled and stored in aliquots at -80°C in 10% glycerol.<br>
Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay to determine a concentration giving approximately 90% inhibition of PDH in the conditions of the assay. For a typical batch, stock enzyme was diluted to 7.5ug/ml.<br>
For assay of the activity of novel compounds, compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and lOul transferred to individual wells of 96-well assay plates. Control wells contained 20^110% DMSO instead of compound. 40ul Buffer containing 50mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, lOmM ethylene glycol-bis(p-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N,N-tetracetic acid (EOTA), ImM benzamidine, ImM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.3mM tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 2mM dithiothreitol (DTT), recombinant rPDHKII and compounds were incubated in the presence of PDH kinase at room temperature for 45 minutes. In order to determine the maximum rate of the PDH reaction a second series of control wells were included containing 10% DMSO instead of compound and<br>
omitting rPDHKII. PDH kinase activity was then initiated by the addition of 5 µM ATP, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 0.04 U/ml PDH (porcine heart PDH Sigma P7032) in a total volume of 50 µl and plates incubated at ambient temperature for a further 45 minutes. The residual activity of the PDH was then determined by the addition of substrates (2.5mM coenzyme A, 2.5mM thiamine pyrophosphate (cocarboxylase), 2.5mM sodium pyruvate, 6mM NAD in a total volume of 80µl and the plates incubated for 90 minutes at ambient temperature. The production of reduced NAD (NADH) was established by measured optical density at 340nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer. The ED50 for a test compound was determined in the usual way using results from 12 concentrations of the compound. (b) In vitro elevation of PDH activity in isolated primary cells<br>
This assay determines the ability of compounds to stimulate pyruvate oxidation in primary rat hepatocytes.<br>
Hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step collagenase digestion procedure described by Seglen (Methods Cell Biol. (1976) 13, 29-33) and plated out in 6-well culture plates (Falcon Primaria) at 600000 viable cells per well in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) containing 10% foetal calf serum (PCS), 10% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco BRL) and 10% non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco BRL). After 4 hours incubation at 37°C in 5% C02, the medium was replaced with Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco BRL) containing NEAA and penicillin/streptomycin as above in addition to 10 nM dexamethasone and 10nM insulin.<br>
The following day cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and medium replaced with 1ml HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (25mM HEPES, 0.15M sodium chloride, 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate, 5mM potassium chloride, 2mM calcium chloride, ImM magnesium sulphate, 1 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate) containing the compound to be tested at the required concentration in 0.1% DMSO. Control wells contained 0.1% DMSO only and a maximum response was determined using a 10 uM treatment of a known active compound. After a preincubation period of 40 minutes at 37°C in 5% CO2, cells were pulsed with sodium pyruvate to a final concentration of 0.5mM (containing 1-14C sodium pyruvate (Amersham product CFA85) 0.18Ci/mmole) for 12 minutes. The medium was then removed and transferred to a tube which was immediately sealed with a bung containing a suspended centre well. Absorbent within the centre well was saturated with 50%<br>
phenylethylamine, and CO2 in the medium released by the addition of 0.2ul 60% (w/v) perchloric acid (PCA). Released 14CO2 trapped in the absorbent was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The ED50 for a test compound was determined in the usual way using results from 7 concentrations of the compound. (c) In vivo elevation of PDH activity<br>
The capacity of compounds to increase the activity of PDH in relevant tissues of rats may be measured using the test described hereinafter. Typically an increase in the proportion of PDH in its active, nonphosphorylated form may be detected in muscle, heart, liver and adipose tissue after a single administration of an active compound. This may be expected to lead to a decrease in blood glucose after repeated administration of the compound. For example a single administration of DCA, a compound known to activate PDH by inhibition of PDH kinase (Whitehouse, Cooper and Randle (1974) Biochem. J. 141, 761-774) 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, increased the proportion of PDH in its active form (Vary et al. (1988) Circ. Shock 24, 3-18) and after repeated administration resulted in a significant decrease in plasma glucose (Evans and Stacpoole (1982) Biochem. Pharmacol.31, 1295-1300).<br>
Groups of rats (weight range 140-180g) are treated with a single dose or multiple doses of the compound of interest by oral gavage in an appropriate vehicle. A control group of rats is treated with vehicle only. At a fixed time after the final administration of compound, animals are terminally anaesthetised, tissues are removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For determination of PDH activity, muscle samples are disrupted under liquid nitrogen prior to homogenisation by one thirty-second burst in a Polytron homogenizer in 4 volumes of a buffer containing 40 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 5 mM EOT A, 2mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, lOmM sodium pyruvate, lOµM phenylmethylsulphonyl chloride (PMSF) and2u£/ml each of leupeptin, pepstain A and aprotinin. Extracts are centrifuged before assay. A portion of the extract is treated with PDH phosphatase prepared from pig hearts by the method of Siess and Wieland (Eur. J. Biochem (1972) 26, 96): 20 µ1 extract, 40 µ1 phosphatase (1:20 dilution), in a final volume of 125 µl containing 25 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride. The activity of the untreated sample is compared with the activity of the dephosphorylated extract thus prepared. PDH activity is assayed by the method of Stansbie et al., (Biochem. J. (1976) 154,225). 50 µl Extract is incubated with 0.75 mM NAD, 0.2 mM Co A, 1.5 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and 1.5mM sodium pyruvate in the presence of<br>
20µg/ml p-(p-amino-phenylazo) benzene sulphonic acid (AABS) and 50 mil/ml arylamine transferase (AAT) in a buffer containing 100 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50mM sodium fluoride, 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol and ImM magnesium chloride pH 7.8. AAT is prepared from pigeon livers by the method of Tabor et al. (J. Biol. Chem. (1953) 204,127). The rate of acetyl CoA formation is determined by the rate of reduction of AABS which is indicated by a decrease in optical density at 460 nm.<br>
Liver samples are prepared by an essentially similar method, except that sodium pyruvate is excluded from the extraction buffer and added to the phosphatase incubation to a final concentration of 5mM.<br>
Treatment of an animal with an active compound results in an increase in the activity of PDH complex in tissues. This is indicated by an increase in the amount of active PDH (determined by the activity of untreated extract as a percentage of the total PDH activity in the same extract after treatment with phosphatase).<br>

As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease state will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. Preferably a daily dose in the range of l-50mg/kg is employed.
