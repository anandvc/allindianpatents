Agrochemical Formulations<br>
The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical formulations in particular liquid formulations of agrochemically active compounds such as acetolactate synthase inhibitors (ALS inhibitors), for example sulfonylureas and salts thereof.<br>
ALS inhibitors are substances which are used in agrochemistry mainly as herbicides. Owing to their low application rate and their generally broad activity spectra, ALS inhibitors are used in all crops of economical importance.<br>
In general, agrochemically active compounds are not employed as pure substances but, depending on the area of use and the desired physical properties of the use form, in combination with certain auxiliaries, i.e. they are "formulated". In principle, active compounds can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or physicochemical parameters. The following are examples of general possibilities for formulations: wettable powders (WP), oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions (EW and EO, respectively), suspensions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL) or else granules for soil application or for broadcasting, or water-dispersible granules (WG). The formulation types mentioned are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], volume 7, C. Hauser-Verlag, Munich, 4th edition, 1986; van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel-Dekker N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd ed., 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
If the agrochemically active compounds to be formulated are compounds which generally tend to degrade chemically in the dissolved state or in liquid media, preference is usually given to solid formulations such as wettable powders or granules. As described in US4599412 and US5731264, this is the case, for example, for herbicidally active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors, such as metsulfuronmethyl, nico- or rimsulfuron, primisulfuronmethyl, tria-, pro-, amido- or ethoxysulfuron. Accordingly, powder formulations or granules of these<br><br>
herbicides - as, for example, in WO9910857, WO9809516, WO9508265, US5441923, W09423573, JP05017305, JP04297404, JP04297403 or JP04066509 - are already known.<br>
Frequently, when such powder formulations or granules are diluted with water (to prepare the spray liquor), the undissolved fractions in the concentrate cannot be dissolved completely, i.e. the spray liquor is a suspension of the concentrate. However, it is always advantageous if spray liquors are as finely divided as possible, since this reduces the risk of the spray nozzles being blocked and thus quite generally the expenditure for cleaning. Moreover, powder and granule formulations can only be prepared with a relatively high input of energy and technically complicated stirrers, i.e. there are considerable disadvantages even during their preparation.<br>
Liquid suspensions of herbicides of the kind described above in the form of suspension concentrates are already known (FR2576181, EP0205348, EP0237292 or EP0246984). However, in the case of suspensions, too, the active compounds are not dissolved, so that during application of the spray liquor similar problems are encountered as in the case of powder formulations or granules. Moreover, suspension concentrates (SC) and suspoemulsions (SB) are thermodynamically unstable formulations having limited physical storage stability.<br>
Surfactant-free aqueous solutions of sulfonylureas are described in US4683000, US4671817 and EP0245058, water-free emulsifiable concentrates are described in the publications DE3422824, US4632693, WO9608148 and US5597778. None of these publications give any hints on how to increase the storage stability of the formulations.<br>
Accordingly, it was an object of the present invention to provide an agrochemical formulation which is stable to degradation and which has favorable performance properties.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that this object is achieved by certain liquid active compound formulations comprising specific polycarboxylic acid esters and, as agrochemically active compounds, ALS inhibitors such as, for example, sulfonylureas and/or salts thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquid formulation (preparation), comprising<br>
a)	one or more compounds from the group of the aikyi esters of polycarboxylic acids, preferably one or more compounds from the group of the C1-C2o-alkyl esters of polycarboxylic acids, and<br>
b)	one or more agrochemically active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors, in particular one or more sulfonylureas and/or salts thereof, for example salts with organic cations based on nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus and/or inorganic cations such as metal cations.<br>
The liquid formulations of the present invention are preferably herbicidal formulations, for example in the form of emulsion concentrates. The formulations preferably comprise at least one of the active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors in dissolved form, the polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) serving as solvent. Preference is furthermore given to formulations which comprise only one polycarboxylic acid alkyl ester a).<br>
If appropriate, the liquid formulations of the present invention may, In addition to components a) and b), also comprise one or more auxiliaries and additives as further components, for example:<br>
(c)	surfactants and/or non-surfactant polymers,<br>
(d)	organic solvents different from component a),<br>
(e)	agrochemicals which are different from ALS inhibitors, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, safeners, growth regulators or fertilizers,<br>
(f)	customary formulation auxiliaries, such as antifoams, evaporation inhibitors, odorants, colorants, antifreeze agents or preservatives, stabilizers, dessicants or thickeners.<br><br>
(g)    tank mix components, and/or (h)   additional water.<br>
The polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters which are present in the formulations according to the invention as component a) can act as solvent and are, for example, alkyl esters of low-molecular-weight dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, tetracarboxylic acids or else carboxylic acids of higher functionality, preferably having 2-20 carbon atoms. Also suitable are polymeric polycarboxylic acids, preferably having molecular weights of up to 2 000 g/mol. Examples of polycarboxylic acids are oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, sebacic, azelaic, suberic, maleic, phthalic, terephthalic, mellitic, trimellitic, polymaleic, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic acid and also CO- or terpolymers comprising maleic, acrylic and/or methacrylic acid units.<br>
Suitable alcohol components of the polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) are, for example, alkyl alcohols, preferably monofunctional alkyl alcohols having 1-20 carbon atoms. Examples for such alkyl alcohols are methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, iso-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, iso-butyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol.<br>
The polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) preferably have the formula (I) below<br><br>
in which<br>
R" and R     are identical or different and are H, an unsubstituted or substituted C1-<br>
C2o-hydrocarbon radical, such as C1-Cio-alkyl, or a group (CR'R")y-CO-OR"', in<br>
which R' and R" are identical or different and are H or an unsubstituted or<br>
substituted CrC2o-hydrocarbon radical, such as C1-Cio-alkyl, y is an integer from 0<br>
to 10 and R'" is an unsubstituted or substituted C1-Cao-hydrocarbon radical, such as<br>
CrCio alkyl,<br>
R and R     are identical or different and are an unsubstituted or substituted<br>
C1-C2o-hydrocarbon radical, such as C1-C10 alkyl, and x is an integer from 0 to 20.<br><br>
Particularly preferred polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) are diesters of the formula (la) below<br><br>
in which<br>
X is an integer from 0 to 20 and<br>
R and R independently of one another are identical or different C1-C6-alkyI radicals.<br>
Examples of polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) are oxalic acid esters, such as dimethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, di-n-propyl oxalate, diisopropyl oxalate and methyl ethyl oxalate, malonic acid esters, such as dimethyl malonate, diethyl malonate, di-n-propyl malonate, diisopropyl malonate and methyl ethyl malonate, succinic acid esters, such as dimethyl succinate, diethyl succinate, di-n-propyl succinate, diisopropyl succinate and methyl ethyl succinate, glutaric acid esters, such as dimethyl glutarate, diethyl glutarate, di-n-propyl glutarate, diisopropyl glutarate and methyl ethyl glutarate, and adipic acid esters, such as dimethyl adipate, diethyl adipate, di-n-propyl adipate, diisopropyl adipate and methyl ethyl adipate. Preference is given to adipic acid esters, in particular to dimethyl adipate.<br>
The polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) can be obtained, for example, by reacting the free carboxylic acids with the alcohols, it being possible to obtain the esters for example by reacting "activated" polycarboxylic acids, such as polycarboxylic anhydrides or poiycarbonyl (poly)chlorides, with the alcohols following known esterification methods.<br>
The active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors present in the formulations according to the invention as component b) are in particular imidazolinones, pyrimidinyloxypyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives, pyrimidinyloxybenzoic acid derivatives, triazolopyrimidinesulfonamide derivatives or<br><br>

The oxo group may also be present at the hetero ring atoms, which may exist in different oxidation states, for example N and S.<br>
For the purpose of this description, substituted radicals, such as substituted hydrocarbon radicals, for example substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl, such as phenyl or benzyl or substituted heterocyclyl, are, for example, substituted radicals which are derived from an unsubstituted parent compound, where the substituents are, for example, one or more, preferably 1, 2 or 3, radicals from the group consisting of halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, carboxyl, cyano, azido, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, formyl, carbamoyl, mono- and dialkylaminocarbonyl, substituted amino, such as acylamino, mono- and dialkylamino, and alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkylsulfonyl and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also alkyl and haloalkyi, and unsaturated aliphatic radicals which correspond to the saturated hydrocarbon-containing radicals mentioned, such as alkenyl, alkynyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, etc. Among the radicals with carbon atoms, preference is given to those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in particular 1 or 2 carbon atoms.

Among these radicals, preference is given, unless specifically indicated otherwise, to lower carbon skeletons, for example those having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or, in the case of unsaturated groups, having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Alkyl radicals, also in composite meanings such as alkoxy, haloalkyi, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-, iso- or cyclopropyl, n-, iso-, tert-, 2- or cyclobutyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, iso-hexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls, such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl; alkenyl and alkynyl radicals have the meanings of the possible unsaturated radicals corresponding to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl is, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methyl-prop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-en-1-yl and 1-methyl-but-2-en-1-yl; alkynyl is, for example, propargyl, but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-yn-1-yl.<br>

For the purpose of the present invention, the active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors which are present as component b) in the liquid formulations according to the invention, such as sulfonylureas, include, in addition to the neutral<br><br>
compounds, in each case also their agriculturally suitable salts with inorganic and/or organic counterions.<br>
The sulfonylureas, for example those of the formula (II), can, for example, form salts in which the hydrogen of the -S02-NH-group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium and potassium salts, or else ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium salts.

Suitable salts with organic counterions are, for example, organic ammonium, sulfonium and phosphonium salts. Preference is given to organic counterions of the formula [NRRR°RV, [SRRR] or [PRRRR Y. or to a quatemary pyridinium ion [Py-R\ where R° to R independently of one another are identical or different and are H or unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbon radicals, such as unsubstituted or substituted (C1-C3o)-alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted (CrCio)-alkylaryl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-C3o)-(oligo)alkenyl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-Cio)-(oligo)alkenylaryl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-C3oHoligo)alkynyl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-CioHoligo)alkynyl, aryl or unsubstituted or substituted aryl, or an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclyl radical, in particular heteroaryl radical, such as unsubstituted or substituted (CrCio)-alkyl-heteroaryl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-Cio)-(oligo)alkenyl-heteroaryl, unsubstituted or substituted (C3-CioHoligo)alkynyl-heteroaryl or unsubstituted or substituted heteroaryl, or two radicals R/R R°/R\ R/R R/R or R/R together may form an unsubstituted or substituted ring, where at least one of the radicals R-R\ at least one of the radicals R-R'* and at least one of the radicals R-R° is different from H.<br><br>
Preferred ALS inhibitors originate from the group of the sulfonylureas, for example pyrimidine- or triazinylaminocarbonyl[benzene-, pyridine-, pyrazole-, thiophene- and (alkylsulfonyl)alkylamino]sulfamides. Preferred substituents on the pyrimidine ring or triazine ring are alkoxy, alkyl, haloalkoxy, haloalkyi, halogen or dimethylamino, where ail substituents can be combined independently of one another.

If appropriate, the liquid formulations of the present invention may, in addition to components a) and b) comprise one or more auxiliaries and additives as further components, for example:<br>
(c)	surfactants such as dispersants and emulsifiers and/or non-surfactant polymers,<br>
(d)	organic solvents different from component a),<br>
(e)	agrochemicals different from ALS inhibitors, for example herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, safeners, growth regulators or fertilizers,<br>

(g)	tank mix components, and/or<br>
(h)    additional water.<br>
Thus, the liquid formulations of the present invention may comprise, as component c), for example one or more surfactants, e.g. ionic, nonionic or betainic surfactants.<br><br>
These can be of monomeric or polymeric nature (for example graft polymers). Examples of component c) are surfactants based on silicone, such as trisiloxane surfactants, derivatives of polydimethylsiloxanes and/or silicone oils, or sugar-based surfactants, such as Atplus 309 F (Uniqema). Further examples of component c) are (C4-C3o)-(poly)alkylene oxide adducts, which may be, for example, branched, linear, saturated or unsaturated, in particular of fatty alcohols and/or fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters. Examples of (poly)alkylene oxide adducts are Soprophor CY8 (Rhodia), Genapol X-060, Genapol X-080, GenapolX-150, Genapol X-200, Sapogenat T 300, Sapogenat T 500, Genapol T 200, Genapol T 800 and Genagen MEE (methyl ester ethoxylates, Clariant) and other terminally capped surfactants having a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or acetyl group as terminal grouping, for example Genapol X-060 methyl ether or Genapol X-150 methyl ether.<br>

Galoryl DT 201 (CFPI), Tamol (BASF) or Monwet D 425 (Witco). By incorporating components which are insoluble in the continous phase or else insoluble active compounds into the formulations, dispersions are obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also embraces dispersions.<br>
Possible components c) include sulfosuccinates, for example those of the formula (III)<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R\R	independently of one another are identical or different and are an<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C1-Cao-hydrocarbon radical, such as d-<br>

alkaline earth metal cation, an ammonium cation, such as NH4, alkyl-,<br>
alkylaryl- or poly(arylalkyl)phenyl-ammonium cation or (poly)alkylene<br>
oxide adducts thereof, or an amino-terminated (poly)alkylene oxide<br>

For the purpose of this description, (poly)alkylene oxide adducts are reaction products of starting materials which can be alkoxylated, such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, such as fatty acids, hydroxy- or amino-functional carboxylic esters (for example triglycerides based on castor oil) or carboxamides with alkylene oxides, where the (poly)alkylene oxide adducts have at least one alkylene oxide unit but are generally polymeric, i.e. have 2-200, preferably 5-150, alkylene oxide units. Among the alkylene oxide units, preference is given to ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide units, in particular to ethylene oxide units. The (poly)alkylene oxide adducts described can be constructed of identical or different alkylene oxides, for example of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide arranged in blocks or randomly, and, accordingly, the present application also comprises such mixed alkylene oxide adducts.<br>
Possible components c) are furthermore non-surfactant polymers, for example polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, polymalates or polyethylene oxides.<br>
The polymers present as component c) can be inorganic (for example silicates, phosphates) or organic, cationic, anionic or neutral and synthetic or naturally occurring.<br>
Moreover, the liquid formulations according to the invention may also comprise, as component d), various organic solvents different from component a), such as<br><br>
nonpolar solvents, polar protic or aprotic dipolar solvents and nnixtures thereof.<br>

In the liquid formulations according to the invention, customary formulation auxiliaries, such as antifoams, antifreeze agents, evaporation inhibitors, preservatives, odorants, colorants, stabilizers, dessicants or thickeners may be present as component f). Preferred formulation auxiliaries are antifreeze agents and evaporation inhibitors such as glycerol, for example in an amount of from 2 to 10%<br>
by weight, and preservatives, for example Mergal K9N (Riedel) or Cobate C.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also, as component g), comprise<br>
tank mix components. Examples of these are tank mix adjuvants, such as Telmion<br>
(Hoechst) or vegetable oils such as Actirob B (Novance) or Hasten (Victorian Chemicals), inorganic compounds such as fertilizers, for example ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium hydrogen sulfate, ureas or hydrotropics.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also comprise, as component h), additional water.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be present, for example, in the form of solutions, emulsion concentrates or dispersions, such as emulsions or suspensions. Here, preferably at least one active compound from the group of the<br><br>
ALS inhibitors, preferably at least one sulfonylurea, is present in dissolved form. In a further preferred embodiment, all active compound ingredients are dissolved.<br>
It is possible to convert the solutions according to the invention comprising components a) and b) and, if appropriate, components c), d), e), f) and g) by addition of water into microemulsions and/or macroemulsions or solutions. Thus, in addition to solutions in polycarboxylic acid alkyl esters a) and/or in organic solvents, the present invention also embraces water-containing formulations such as microemulsions and macroemulsions (for example EW and EO formulations).<br>
By incorporating active compounds or components which are insoluble in the continuous phase into the formulations, dispersions are obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also embraces such dispersions. On dilution with water, the formulations according to the invention give dispersions or else water-containing solutions, which are likewise embraced by the present invention.<br>
The content of active compound in the formulations according to the invention may be generally between 0.001% by weight and 60% by weight, higher loads being possible in individual cases, in particular when a plurality of active compounds are used. Since ALS inhibitors are highly effective active compounds, the preferred application rates are usually between 1 and 1000 g, preferably 500 g, with preference between 1 and 100 g, of active substance/hectare. In general, the content of polycarboxylic acid derivatives according to the invention is 0.01-99.9%, preferably 0.1-99%; however, this may be higher or lower in individual cases.<br>
Preferred weight ratios of the components a) and b) in the liquid formulations according to the invention, in particular in emulsion concentrates, are 0.1:1-1000:1, preferably 1:1 to 500:1, in particular 1:1 to 200:1. Particular preference is given to an excess by weight of component a) compared to component b), for example about 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 10:1, 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, 300:1, 400:1 and 500:1.<br><br>
The auxiliaries and additives which can be used for preparing the formulations according to the invention, such as, for example, surfactants and solvents, are known in principle and are described, for example, in: McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisleyand Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ.Co.Inc, N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [SurfaC6-Active Ethylene Oxide Adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], volume 7, C.Hauser-Verlag, Munich, 4th edition 1986.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be prepared by customary known processes, i.e., for example, by mixing the different components with the aid of stirrers, shakers or (static) mixers. If appropriate, brief heating may be advantageous. In the case of salt-like ALS inhibitors, this simple process makes it possible to prepare the corresponding ALS inhibitor salts in situ by using, for example, nonionic surfactants, preferably those in which no neutralization has been carried out.<br>
Thus, the present invention also embraces the processes described for preparing the liquid formulations according to the invention. These processes are distinguished in particular by production-related advantages.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ALS inhibitors used, such as sulfonylureas, are inhibitors with counterions having phase-transfer properties. Such counterions are, for example, organic counterions, such as organic ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium ions. Such counterions can be incorporated in a particularly simple manner into the formulations if they are present in admixture with additional, for example nonionic, formulation components. Accordingly, the invention also embraces the incorporation of the counterions into the formulations.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention preferably comprise<br><br>
(a)	from 0.01 to 99.9% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 60% by weight, of polycarboxylic acid alky! esters,<br>

in which<br>
R'" and R' are identical or different (CrCio)alkyl, such as 2-ethylhexyl, and<br>
M	is a metal cation, for example an alkali metal ion such as Na or K.<br>
These particularly preferred combinations, too, can be formulations in their own right<br>
or else form the basis for a finished formulation.<br>
By using the formulations according to the invention, it is possible to obtain storage-stable solutions of ALS inhibitors such as sulfonylureas and/or salts thereof, and also liquid formulations in which at least one sulfonylurea and/or its salt is/are dissolved.<br>
If a sulfonylurea and/or a salt derived therefrom is/are dissolved in component a), it is possible to obtain corresponding liquid formulations by adding surfactants and, if appropriate, further auxiliaries.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be used, for example, for controlling undesirable vegetation, for example, in crops of plants. To this end, an effective amount of the formulation according to the invention is, if required after dilution with water, applied to the seeds, plants, parts of plants or the area to be treated, for example the area under cultivation.<br>
The formulations according to the invention are formulations which are physically and chemically stable and which, on dilution with water, give spray liquors having favorable physical performance characteristics. In addition, the formulations according to the invention have favorable biological properties and can be used widely, for example for controlling undesirable vegetation.<br><br>
