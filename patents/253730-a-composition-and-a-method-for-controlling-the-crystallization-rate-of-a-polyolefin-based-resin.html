				<td>The present invention relates to a composition and a method for controlling the crystallization rate of a polyolefin-based resin.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for controlling crystallization rate of a polyolef in-based resin, a polyolefin-based resin composition containing the crystallization rate-controlling composition, a polyolefin-based resin molded product obtained by molding the resin composition , a method for controlling the crystallization rate during molding of the polyolefin-based resin composition, and a process for preparing polyolefin-based resin molded product using the controlling method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Due to their excellent moldability, mechanical<br>
characteristics, electrical properties, etc., polyolefin-based<br>
resins are used in various fields as materials for film molding<br>
(i.e., molding for production of films) , sheet molding (i.e.,<br>
molding for production of sheets) , blowmolding, injection molding,<br>
etc. Although physical properties are generally excellent, such polyolefin-based resins have the problem of having low transparency, crystallizability and rigidity.<br>
There have heretofore been proposals to use amide-based compounds, etc. as a nucleating agent so as to solve these problems (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1994-192496, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1995-242610, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.1995-278374, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.1996-100088). When polyolefin in-based resin compositions containing such amide-based compounds are molded, molded products with excellent transparency and mechanical strength can be obtained.<br>
However, in order to obtain molded products with such outstanding characteristics in commercial production, the molding conditions need to be optimized according to the molding method to be adopted.<br>
The molding methods include injection molding, extrusion molding, sheet molding, film molding, blow molding, etc. Molded product manufacturers must appropriately determine the molding conditions (injection or extrusion rate, injection pressure, resin temperature, mold temperature, chill roll temperature, shape of molds, etc. ) of the molding machine according to the molding method, so as to optimize the processing conditions.<br>
However, optimization of such molding conditions takes<br>
much time since many variables need to be determined, and the determination thereof is complicated. When such molding conditions are not determined correctly, the following problems may occur: white spots originating from non-dispersed nucleating agents may appear in the molded products, the transparency of the molded products may be inferior, the mechanical strength of the molded products may be weak, etc.<br>
It is also known that certain nucleating agents elevate the crystallization temperature of polyolefin-based resins to some extent, and the molding cycle time can be shortened by using such nucleating agent. However, the use of such nucleating agent merely results in a crystallization temperature peculiar to the use of such nucleating agent, and the crystallization temperature cannot be controlled. Therefore, the use of such nucleating agent currently does not greatly contribute toward facilitating and expediting the setting of molding conditions or diversification and flexibility of the processing conditions.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the above situation, an object of the invention is to facilitate and expedite the setting of molding conditions, or to diversify and render flexible the processing conditions.<br>
Under the above-described circumstances, the inventors have conducted intensive research to solve the above-described problems. In particular, the inventors investigated into the setting of processing conditions, and found that the cumber someness in setting processing conditions is largely attributable to the crystallization rate of polyolefin-based resins, and if the crystallization rate of polyolefin-based resins can be controlled without solely depending on the setting of processing conditions by means of a molding machine, the setting of processing conditions can be facilitated and expedited, and the processing conditions can be rendered flexible and diversified.<br>
More specifically, depending on the type of the molding method and the resin to be molded, the rapid crystallization rate of a resin may sometimes hinder the processing. For example, if the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin is not in a suitable range, a homogenous molded product cannot be obtained by film molding, sheet molding, blow forming, injection molding of a large-size product, or the like. However, in order to reduce the crystallization rate to said suitable range, the cumbersome setting of processing conditions (such as resin discharge speed, resin discharge amount, pressure at the time of injection molding, chill roll rotation speed, mold or chill roll temperature, mold shape, cooling time, cooling rate, etc.) by means of a molding machine<br>
must be resorted to. On the other hand, it wouldbe industrially advantageous, for example, in the field of the injection molding for small-size products or the like, if the crystallization rate of polypropylene-based resin can be increased to shorten the molding cycle time (high speed molding) so as to reduce production costs as much as possible. However, in order to shorten the molding cycle time, it is only known to use a certain nucleating agent to increase the crystallization temperature, and in order to increase the crystallization rate, the cumbersome setting of the processing conditions by means of a molding machine (such as cooling time, cooling speed, etc.) must again be resorted to.<br>
Under the circumstances, the present inventors considered that a resin composition by which the crystallization rate can be controlled, if provided, would allow a wide range of processing without solely depending on the cumbersome procedure for determining processing variables by means of a molding machine.<br>
The present inventors conducted further researches, and found that when (A) a specific amide-based compound and (B) a specific fatty acid metal salt are mixed with a polyolefin-based resin in a specific weight ratio, the crystallization rate (end time of crystallization) of the polyolefin-based resin is controllable. Specifically, the inventors obtained the following findings:<br>
 (a)	Specific amide-based compounds (A) are<br>
dissolution-type nucleating agents.<br>
When the change in storage modulus with temperature<br>
of a molten polyolefin-based resin composition prepared by<br>
dissolving the amide-based compound (A) in a polyolefin-based<br>
resin is measured, there is a transition point in each of the<br>
curve obtained during heating and the curve obtained during<br>
cooling, and the derivative curve obtained from each storage<br>
modulus temperature dependency curve shows an extreme value.<br>
The finding in item (b) above shows that a network<br>
structure formed of fibrous particles of the above amide-based<br>
compound is present in the molten polyolefin-based resin in<br>
a specific temperature range. This fact was heretofore not<br>
known at all, but was discovered for the first time by the<br>
inventors.<br><br>
When the resin temperature (molding temperature)<br>
T during molding is set to a temperature not higher than the<br>
transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh<br>
or to a temperature higher than Tsh, and the amide-based compound<br>
(A) and a specific fatty acid metal salt (B) are used in a specif ic<br>
ratio, the crystallization rate (end time of crystallization)<br>
of the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled.<br>
More specifically, as shown in Fig. 8, in case the<br>
resin temperature (molding temperature) T during molding is<br>
set to a temperature not lower than the melting temperature<br>
Tm of the polyolefin-based resin but not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh (molding method (I) shown in Fig. 8) , the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be increased (end time of crystallization can be shortened) when the proportion of the specific fatty acid metal salt (B) is increased (region (IA) -&gt; region (IAB)) .<br>
Also in case the resin temperature (molding<br>
temperature) T during molding is set to a temperature higher<br>
than the transition temperature of storage modulus during<br>
heating Tsh (molding method (II) shown in Fig. 8), the<br>
crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be<br>
reduced (end time of crystallization can be prolonged) when<br>
the proportion of the specific fatty acid metal salt (B) is<br>
increased (region (IIA) - region (IIAB)).<br>
Thus, when observed over the entire molding<br>
temperature range consisting of the temperature range not higher<br>
than the transition temperature of storage modulus during<br>
heating Tsh and the temperature range higher than Tsh, and also<br>
when observed in each of the resin temperature range from Tm<br>
to Tsh and the resin temperature range higher than Tsh, by<br>
changing the proportion of the specific fatty acid metal salt,<br>
the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be<br>
controlled, i.e. , reduced or increased, as compared with the<br>
crystallization rate achieved in molding method (II) mentioned<br>
in item (f) by using the crystallization rate controlling composition comprising only the specific amide-based compound (without containing the fatty acid metal salt).<br>
(h) Molding method (I) mentioned in item (e) above can increase the crystallization rate, and therefore shortens the molding cycle time, the reduction of which is generally the main purpose of using nucleating agents, and is therefore suitable mainly for injection molding of small-size products at high speed. In this case, the molding is carried out at a resin temperature not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, and therefore, as shown in (I) of Fig. 7, the molding is carried out while the network structure mentioned in item (c) above is present, and the fibrous particles constituting the network structure is oriented, with the result that the polyolefin-based resin crystal lamellae can be oriented in the resulting molded product, consequently giving a molded product that is particularly excellent in rigidity. By increasing or reducing the proportion of fatty acid metal salt (B), the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled.<br>
(i) On the other hand, molding method (II) mentioned in item (f) above can decrease the crystallization rate, and tends to give homogeneous molded products, and therefore is advantageous for film molding, sheet molding and injection molding of large-size molded products. In this case, the<br>
molding is carried out at a resin temperature higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, and therefore, as shown in (II) of Fig. 7, the molding is carried out, with no network structure mentioned in item (c) above being present, with the result that, upon cooling the molten resin composition, fibrous particles of the amide-based compound are formed and re-constitute a network structure, from which minute crystals (spherulites) of the polyolef in-based resin are formed, and consequently molded products having excellent transparency can be produced. By increasing or reducing the proportion of fatty acid metal salt (B), the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled.<br>
(j) As stated above, the present invention can control (change) the polyolef in-based resin crystallization rate, but does not substantially modify other nucleating functions of the amide-based compound. Thus, according to the invention, the crystallization rate can be controlled not only by setting the molding machine variables but also by using the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention, thereby expanding the flexibility of setting the molding conditions during molding process, consequently facilitating production of molded products having excellent properties. Based on these findings, the inventors conducted further research and accomplished the present invention. The present invention provides a polyolefin-based resin<br>
crystallization rate-controlling composition, a resin composition comprising the crystallization rate-controlling composition, a molded product obtained by molding the polyolef in-based resin composition and its production process, and a method for controlling the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin, a process for producing a polyolefin-based resin molded product using the controlling method, and the like, that are described below.<br>

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, the use of the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention<br>
allows control of the crystallization rate of a polyolef in-based resin during molding of the polyolefin-based resin. The details are described as follows.<br>
(I) In the case where the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) T is not lower than the melting temperature Tm of a polyolef in-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin can be increased (the end time of crystallization can be shortened) by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70.<br>
(II) In the case where the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) T is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be reduced (the end time of crystallization can be extended) by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A): component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70.<br>
Thus, when observed over the entire molding temperature range, and also when observed in each of the resin temperature range from Tm to Tsh and the resin temperature range higher than Tsh, by changing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70, the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin<br>
canbe controlled, i.e. , reduced or increased, as compared with the crystallization rate achieved in molding method (I) above wherein the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio is 100 : 0.<br>
Therefore, the polyolefin-based resin crystallization rate-controlling composition, when blended with a polyolef in-based resin, can control the crystallization rate during molding of the polyolef in-based resin, provide a further option for setting molding conditions for producing desired molded products, and facilitate setting of the molding conditions, without solely depending on molding machines. In other words, the invention provides a polyolef in-based resin composition that is suitable and flexible for use in various molding methods such as injection molding, extrusion molding, sheet molding, film molding, blow molding and the like.<br>
When the polyolefin-based resin composition thus obtained is molded by method (I) or (II) mentioned above, molded products with excellent properties can be obtained. More specifically, the processing according to (I) above significantly contributes to the improvement of rigidity of polyolefin-based resin molded products, and this effect is remarkable especially in homopolypropylene resins, block polypropylene resins, and high-density polyethylene resins. On the other hand, the processing according to (II) above significantly contributes to an improvement in transparency<br>
of the polyolefin-based resin molded products, and this effect is remarkable especially in homopolypropylene resins and random polypropylene resins.<br>

In this specification, the trans configured moiety with respect to the streoisomeric structure of the alkylcyclohexylamine residue (especially, the residue obtained by removing the amino group from an alkylcyclohexylamine, particularly the residue obtained by removing the amino group from a 2-alkylcyclohexylamine)<br>
constituting the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) refers to an alkylcyclohexyl moiety represented by General Formula (X),<br>
wherein R4 represents a c1-10linear or branched alkyl group (especially, methyl) , and in par ticular, to a 2-alkylcyclohexyl moiety represented by General Formula (XI),<br><br>

the ratio of trans isomer : cis isomer (molar ratio determined<br>
by GLC; hereinafter referred to as "GLC composition ratio") of a star ting material alkylcyclohexylamine. This is confirmed by the following observation: (a) the ratio of trans isomer : cis isomer of a starting material alkylcyclohexylamine is identical to the ratio of trans isomer : cis isomer of the unreacted alkylcyclohexylamine remaining after the starting material was subjected to the amidation reaction, and (b) the product amide obtained in the invention, when treated at a temperature condition similar to that used in the amidation reaction (room temperature to 280 °C) , had a FT-IR spectrum and a melting point that are in full agreement with those measured before the treatment, verifying that the stereo configuration was not altered by the amidation reaction. Thus, the ratio of trans configured moiety : cis configured moiety (trans : cis) in the amide-based compound mixture is controllable by the trans : cis isomer ratio of the starting material amine.<br>

The crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention not only controls the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin, but also improves, by addition of component (B), the dispersibility and solubility of the amide-based compounds in the polyolefin-based resin.<br>
In particular, by using an amide-based compound and a fatty acid metal salt as admixed in advance, the attained effects tend to be more remarkable. The mixing method is not particularly limited, and it is possible to employ methods such as a method comprising mixing them in a powder form; a method comprising mixing them at a temperature not lower than the<br>
mel ting point of the fatty acid metal salt; a method comprising mixing the amide-based compound and the fatty acid metal salt in a form dissolved or dispersed in a solvent, removing the solvent and drying, followed by, if necessary, granulation, pulverizing, crashing, etc.<br>
There is no limitation on the forms of the<br>
crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention, and they may be suitably selected from powders, granules, tablets, pellets and the like.<br>
When the crystallization rate-controlling<br>
composition takes the form of a powder or granules, the particle diameter thereof is not limited as long as the effects of the invention can be obtained. However, from the viewpoint of dispersibility or dissolution speed in a molten polyolefin-based resin, the smaller the particle diameter the better. The maximum particle diameter, as measured by laser diffraction light scattering, is generally not more than 200 preferably not more than 100 Jim, more preferably not more than 50 | and particularly preferably not more than 10 When the crystallization rate-controlling<br>
composition takes the form of granules, tablets, pellets or like granulated form, the shape and particle diameter thereof can be suitably selected and these granulated forms can be obtained using known granulators, pulverizers/crushers, classifiers, etc. Such granulated forms, when taken,<br>
contribute toward improving powder flowability, suppressing dust explosion (decrease in occurrence of dust explosion) , and the like.<br>
Examples of usable granulators include dry- or wet-extrusion granulators, mixing granulators, tableting machines, dry compression roll granulators, and marumerizers (product name, product of DALTON Co., Ltd.). Examples of pulverizers/crushers include pin mills, jet mills, pulverizers, cutter mills, hammer mills, planer crushers, and nibblers. Examples of classifiers include vibrating sieves, air separators, etc.<br>
In addition to an amide-based compound and a fatty acid metal salt, if necessary, polyolefin resin modifiers and the like may be added, insofar as the effects of the invention are not adversely affected.<br>
Examples of such polyolefin modifiers include the various additives listed in "The Tables of Positive Lists of Additives" edited by the Japan Hygienic Olefin and Styrene Plastic Association (January, 2002) . More specific examples include stabilizers (such as metal compounds, epoxy compounds, nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds, sulfur compounds, etc.) , UV absorbers (such as benzophenone-based compounds and benzotriazole-based compounds), antioxidants (such as phenol-based compounds, phosphorous ester-based compounds, and sulfur-based compounds), surfactants (such as glycerol<br>

The amount of the additives is not limited insofar as the effects of the invention are not adversely affected.<br>

hydrotalcite, mica, zeolite, perlite, diatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, etc. are preferable. Such fillers can be used singly or in combination.<br>
When the above-mentioned additives are added, though there is no particular limitation, a preferable method is that the amide-based compound, fatty acid metal salt and other components are dry blended to obtain a homogeneous mixture.<br>
Polyolefin-based resin composition<br>
The polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention comprises a polyolefin-based resin, the above-described components (A) and (B) , and, if necessary, polyolef in resin modifiers and the like. The polyolefin-based resin composition canbe obtained, for example, by incorporating the crystallization rate-controlling composition into a polyolefin-based resin by a conventional method.<br>
The polyolefin resin composition of the invention can be manufactured by any conventional method, with no particular restrictions thereon, as long as the desired resin composition is obtained.  For example, a polyolefin-based resin (powder, granules or pellets) and a crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention (or alternatively, a polyolefin-based resin (powder, granules or pellets), components (A) and (B) of the invention, and, if necessary, the above-mentioned polyolef in resin modifiers) are<br>
mixed using a conventional mixer, such as a Henschel mixer, a ribbon blender, a V-blender or the like to obtain a blend type polyolefin-based resin composition. Other examples include a method in which this blend type polyolef in-based resin composition is melt-kneaded in a conventional kneader, such as a single screw or twin screw extruder, generally at a temperature of 160 to 300°C, preferably 180 to 280°C, and particularly preferably 200 to 260°C, the extruded strands are cooled, and the strands thus obtained are cut into pellets, thereby giving a pellet type polyolefin-based resin composition.<br>
As the method of adding the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention to a polyolefin-based resin, a single-step addition using a conventional machine, such as a single screw or twin screw extruder, etc. , is preferable. However, a two-step addition using a master batch of high concentration in the range of about 2 to 15 wt.% may also be employed.<br>
An amide-based compound (A) and a fatty acid metal salt (B) according to the invention may be added to a polyolefin-based resin in the form of a crystallization rate-controlling composition, or may be added simultaneously or separately such that the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio fall within a range of 100:0 to 30:70, preferably 95:5 to 30:70.<br>
For example, the polyolef in-based resin composition of the invention may be prepared by dissolving component (B) of the invention in the polyolef in-based resin to obtain a resin composition in the form of a powder, pellets, granules, etc. in advance, and then incorporating component (A) of the invention and if desired the above polyolef in modifiers and the like into the obtained resin composition.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the crystallization rate-controlling composition in the polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention as long as the desired effects can be attained, and the amount can be suitably selected from a wide range. Generally, however, the amount of the crystallization rate-controlling composition is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolef in-based resin. By blending the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention in an amount within the above range, the effects of the invention can be sufficiently produced.<br>
Components (A) and (B) may be simultaneously or separately added to the polyolef in-based resin, and in that case, it is also recommended that the total amount of components (A) and (B) is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin-based resin.<br>
-59-From the standpoint of nucleating performance, the amount of at least one amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) (Component (A)) is preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin-based resin. Within this range, a significant improvement in transparency or rigidity can be observed.<br>
The polyolefin-based resin composition can give a molded product having excellent transparency or rigidity, even when the amide-based compound of General Formula (1) alone is used (namely component (A) alone is used without using component (B)) . However, in order to improve transparency or rigidity and also in order to control the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin, it is preferable to use a fatty acid metal salt (component (B)).<br>
It is advantageous that the amount of the fatty acid metal salt (component (B) ) is generally 0 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0 to 1 parts by weight, more preferably 0.005 to 0.5 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.01 to 0.3 parts byweight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolef in-based resin. Also, by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A): component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30 :70, the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled (end time of crystallization can be controlled).<br>
Examples of polyolef in-based resins of the present: invention include polyethylene-based resins, polypropylene-based resins, polybutene-based resins, polymethyIpentene-based resins, polybutadiene-based resin, and the like. Specific examples thereof include high-density polyethylenes, medium-density polyethylenes, linear polyethylenes, ethylene copolymers with an ethylene content of at least 50 wt%, and preferably 70 wt% or higher, propylene homopolymers, propylene copolymers with a propylene content of at least 50 wt%, and preferably 70 wt% or higher, butene homopolymers, butene copolymers with a butene content of at least 50 wt%, and preferably 70 wt% or higher, methyIpentene homopolymers, me thy Ipentene copolymers with a me thy Ipentene content of at least 50 wt%, and preferably 70 wt% or higher, polybutadiene, etc.<br>
The above copolymers may be random copolymers or block copolymers. The stereoregularity of these resins may be isotactic or syndiotactic.<br>
Specific examples of comonomers which can form the above various copolymers include ethylene, propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, undecene, dodecene and like C2-Ci2 ct-olefins;<br>
1,4-endomethylenecyclohexene and like bicyclic monomers; methyl (meth)aerylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate and like (meth)acrylic esters; vinyl acetate, etc.<br>
Examples of catalysts used for manufacturing such polymers include not only generally used Ziegler-Natta catalysts but also catalyst systems comprising a combination of a transition metal compound (e.g. , a titanium halide such as titanium trichloride or titanium tetrachloride) supported on a support comprising, as a main component, magnesium chloride or like magnesium halide, with an alkylaluminum compound (such as triethylaluminum or diethylaluminum chloride) , and metallocene catalysts.<br>
The recommended melt flow rate (hereinafter referred to as "MFR", measured according to JIS K 7210-1995) of the polyolef in resin used in the invention can be suitably selected according to the molding method to be employed, but is usually 0.01 to 200 g/10 min, and preferably 0.05 to 100 g/10 min. To the extent that the effects of the invention are not impaired, the above-mentioned known polyolefin modifiers maybe added to the polyolef in-based resin composition of the invention depending on the purpose and/or application thereof.<br>
With the thus-obtained polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention, the crystallization rate can be controlled by varying the resin temperature conditions during molding and the proportions of component (A) and component (B) . The details are as follows.<br>
(I) In the case where the resin temperature during<br>
molding (molding temperature) T is not lower than the melting temperature of a polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin can be increased (the end time of crystallization can be shortened) by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70. With this molding method (I), molded products especially excellent in rigidity can be produced.<br>
(II) In the case where the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) T is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be reduced (the end time of crystallization can be extended) by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the components (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70. With this molding method (II) , molded products especially containing a low amount of undispersed nucleating agent and having excellent transparency can be produced.<br>
Thus, when observed over the entire molding temperature range consisting of the resin temperature range from Tm to Tsh and the resin temperature range higher than Tsh, and also when observed in each of the resin temperature range from Tm to Tsh and the resin temperature range higher than Tsh, by changing the proportion of component (B) , the crystallization rate of<br>
the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled, i.e., reduced or increased, as compared with the crystallization rate achieved in molding method (II) wherein component (A) : component (B) weight ratio is 100 : 0.<br>
Method for controlling the crystallization rate of a polyolefin-based resin<br>
As described above, the polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention can control the crystallization rate during molding by varying the resin temperature conditions during molding and the proportions of component (A) and component (B). Thus, the present invention also provides a method for controlling the crystallization rate (end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin during molding, the method comprising incorporating components (A) and (B) into the polyolefin-based resin in such a manner that the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio is within the range from 100:0 to 30:70.<br>
In the controlling method of the invention, there are no particular restrictions on the amount of the polyolefin-based resin crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention as long as the desired effects can be attained, and the amount can be suitably selected from a wide range. Generally, the amount of the crystallization rate-controlling composition is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight,<br>
preferably 0 .05 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin-based resin.<br>
When Components (A) and (B) are simultaneously or separately added to the polyolefin-based resin, it is also recommended that the total amount of components (A) and (B) is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin-based resin.<br>
In this specification and claims, the term "end time of crystallization" denotes a value determined from the results obtained by using a differential scanning calorimeter ("OSC7" , trade name, manufactured by Perkin-Elmer) , as will be described below and later in Examples.<br>
More specifically, the temperature of a<br>
polyolefin-based resin composition is adjusted to a temperature at which molding is carried out, and is then quenched to a temperature at which end time of crystallization is measured (which is in the range 0 to 20°C higher than the crystallization temperature (determined by the method to be described in Examples) of the composition) at a cooling rate of 100 to 200°C per minute, and then isothermal crystallization of the polyolefin-based resin is carried out at the measurement temperature.<br>
In the chart (see Fig. 1) obtained by the differential<br>
scanning calorimetry, an extension line indicated by (a) in Fig. 1 is drawn by extending the baseline from the longer time side toward the shorter time side, and also a tangential line indicated by (b) in Fig. 1 is drawn at the point of the curve (d) in the longer time side of the heat flow peak where the tangential line has a maximum slope, and then the point (indicated by (c) in Fig. 1) at which the extension line and the tangential line intersect is determined. The time at the intersection is defined as "the end time of crystallization" of the polyolefin-based resin composition.<br>
The longer the end time of crystallization, the longer the time period during which the polyolefin-based resin composition is moldable. Measurement start time in measuring the end time of crystallization is a point at which the temperature of the polyolef in-based resin composition quenched has reached the measurement temperature.<br>
Depending on the type of molding methods and resins to be molded, a rapid crystallization rate of a resin may sometimes hinder the processing. For example, if the crystallization rate of a polyolef in-based resin is not within a suitable range, a homogenous molded product is difficult to obtain by in jection molding of large-size products, f ilmmolding, sheet molding, blow forming, or the like.<br>
On the other hand, it would be industrially advantageous, for example, in the field of injection molding<br>
for small-size products, if the crystallization rate of polyolefin-based resins can be increased to shorten crystallization time so as to reduce production costs as much as possible.<br>
Thus, if a method for controlling the crystallization rate of a polyolef in-based resin, or a resin composition in which the crystallization rate can be controlled is available, a wide range of processing can be realized without solely depending on the complicatedprocedures for determining molding machine variables, whereby an object of the invention is achieved. The present invention also provides a method for controlling the crystallization rate of a polyolefin-based resin and a polyolef in-based resin composition that is suitable for various molding methods.<br>
The method of controlling the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin according to the invention comprises incorporating a polyolefin-based resin crystallization rate-controlling composition into a polyolefin-based resin to give a polyolefin-based resin composition, and molding the polyolefin-based resin composition.<br>
Alternatively, the controlling method may comprise, for example, dissolving component (B) of the invention in the polyolefin-based resin to give a resin composition in advance in the form of a powder, pellets, granules, etc. , incorporating<br>
component (A) of the invention into the resin composition to obtain the polyolef in-based resin composition of the invention, and then molding the polyolefin-based resin composition.<br>
More specifically the method for controlling the crystallization rate according to the invention comprises the step of:<br>
incorporating components (A) and (B) which<br>
constitute the polyolefin-based resin crystallization-rate<br>
controlling composition simultaneously or separately into a<br>
polyolefin-based resin to give a polyolefin-based resin<br>
composition of the invention, and<br>
molding said polyolefin-based resin<br>
composition.<br>
Step (1) is as described above in the item entitled "Polyolefin-based resin composition.11 Since the amide-based compound (A) of the invention is a dissolution-type nucleating agent, it is important to fully dissolve the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention in a polyolefin-based resin before Step (2) above is carried out, in order that the performance of the crystallization rate-controlling composition can be maximally achieved and that the effects of the invention are produced.<br>
Step (2) is described below in detail.<br>
In this specification and claims, the transition temperature of storage modulus during cooling (referred to as<br>
"Tsc") and the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating (referred to as "Tsh") are defined as follows.<br>
The amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) used in the invention forms a thermo-reversible network structure made of fibrous particles in the polyolef in-based resin. The storage modulus of the invention is attributed to this formation of the network structure formed by the fibrous particles of the amide-based compound. The storage modulus (G1) of the molten polyolefin-based resin containing the amide-based compound changes discontinuously as a function of temperature. An example is schematically shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown by the broken line in Fig. 2, the storage modulus (G1) of the molten polyolef in-based resin containing the amide-based compound varies (increases) discontinuously due to the formation of a network structure made of fibrous particles during cooling, and the temperature at which the maximum rate of change of variation occurs is defined as Tsc. As shown by the solid line in Fig. 2,6' varies (decreases) during heating due to a breakdown of the network structure due to dissolution of fibrous particles of the amide-based compound, and the temperature at which the maximum rate of change of variation occurs is defined as Tsh.<br>
Tsc and Tsh can be determined by measuring the dynamic viscoelasticityusingarheometer. Themeasurementmethodwill<br>
be described later in detail in Examples. Thereby, a curve during heating (solid line) and a curve during cooling (broken line) are obtained as shown in Fig. 2, and the curves are con verted into derivative curves, whereby peaks appear as shown in Fig. 3. The temperatures at which these peaks appear are defined as Tsh and Tsc, respectively.<br>
Tsh and Tsc may vary depending on the type of the amide-based compound (s) representedby General Formula (1) used, and the amount thereof and the like. For example, Tsh and Tsc shift to higher temperatures when the content of amide-based compound(s) is high or when the proportion of the trans-configured form of the stereoisomeric alkylcyclohexylamine residue consitituting the amide-based compound(s) is high.<br>
Therefore, before manufacturing the<br>
polyolefin-based resin molded product of the invention, a polyolefin-based resin composition containing the crystallization rate-controlling composition dissolved therein is preliminarily prepared, and the Tsh and Tsc values of the obtained resin composition are measured beforehand. According to the Tsh and Tsc values thus measured, the temperature conditions during practical production of the polyolefin-based resin molded product may be adjusted.<br>
Generally, when at least one amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) wherein R1 is a residue<br>
obtained by removing all of the carboxyl groups from 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid is used, Tsh may range from 170 to 250 °C, particularly from 180 to 240°C. When at least one amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) wherein R1 is a residue obtained by removing all of the carboxyl groups from 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid is used, Tsh may generally range from 180 to 280 °C, particularly from 190 to 270°C.<br>
For controlling the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin, the resin temperature (molding temperature) T during step (2) is a particularly important variable. Hereinafter, the method for controlling the crystallization rate will be described with respect to a situation (molding method (I)) in which the resin temperature T is not higher than Tsh (and not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolef in-based resin) , and then with respect to a situation (molding method (II)) in which the resin temperature is higher than Tsh.<br><molding method the resin temperature t is not lower than melting of polyolef in-based referred to as and higher tsh tm tstsh crystallization rate composition can be increased time></molding>
be shortened) by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 8, when the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) T is set to a temperature that is not lower than the melting temperature Tm of the polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh (molding method (I) of Fig. 7) , the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be increased (end time of crystallization can be shortened) by increasing the proportion of the specific fatty acid metal salt (B) (region (IA) -»region (IAB)) . The degree of increase in crystallization rate mainly depends on the combination of components (A) and (B) and the weight ratio of component (B) to component (A).<br>
Molding method (I) significantly contributes to an improvement in rigidity of a polyolefin-based resin molded product, and the improvement is particularly noticeable in homopolypropylene resins, block polypropylene resins and high-density polyethylene resin.<br>
In this resin temperature range, molding is carried out in such a state that the above-described network structure is maintained (i.e., a temperature at which the fibrous particles forming the network structure do not dissolve or melt) , and thus the fibrous particles forming the network structure<br>
are orientated, and the polyolefin-based resin crystallizes in an orientated manner.<br>
More specifically, as shown in (I) in Pig. 7, molding is carried out at a temperature not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, with the network structure being maintained, and therefore the fibrous particles constituting the network structure is oriented, with the result that the polyolefin-based resin crystal lamellae are orientated in the resulting molded product, consequently giving a. molded product especially excellent in rigidity.<br>
The molding method of the polyolefin-based resin composition in step (2) can be widely applied to all types of molding methods that comprise an injection step or an extrusion step. Such molding methods include injection molding, extrusion molding, in j ection blow molding, in j ec tion extrusion blow molding, injection compression molding, extrusion blow molding, extrusion thermof orm molding, fiber production by melt spinning, etc.<br>
In molding step (2) , the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be controlled over a wide range by utilizing the phenomenon that the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) forms a network structure in the polyolefin-based resin, in addition to the use of the polyolefin-based resin crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention.<br><br>
Hereinafter, molding method (I) is described in more<br>
detail. Molding method (I) is also a process for producing<br>
a molded product, the process being capable of controlling<br>
(increasing) the crystallization rate by the use of component<br>
(B) . Molding method (I) will be described with reference to<br>
(I) of Fig. 7 which schematically illustrates the production<br>
method of the polyolef in-based resin composition (production<br>
of pellets) and the process for producing a polyolef in-based<br>
resin molded product (molding method) of the invention.<br><process for preparing a polyolefin-based resin composition></process>
(pellets )&gt;<br>
As described above/ the polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention is typically produced by the following method.<br>
For example, the polyolef in-based resin (in the form of particles, granules, or pellets) and the above-described crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention (alternatively, the polyolefin-based resin (in the form of particles, granules, or pellets) and components (A) and (B) of the invention, and, if desired, the above-described polyolefin modifiers) are dry-blended using a conventional mixer, such as a Henschel mixer, ribbon blender, V-blender, etc. The dry-blended product thus obtained is melt-kneaded at a temperature which is the same as or higher than the temperature at which the amide-based compound of the invention<br>
represen ted by General Formula (1) melts, using a conventional kneader, such as single screw or twin screw extruder or the like, giving a molten mixture (see (al) of Fig. 7).<br>
The obtained molten mixture is extruded and the resin temperature T of the resultant strand is cooled to a temperature which is equal to or lower than the transition temperature of storage modulus during cooling Tsc, thus giving a polyolefin-based resin composition containing a network structure of fibrous particles of the amide-based compound (see (a2) of Fig. 7) . The thin lines in (a2) of Fig. 7 schematically illustrate the fibrous particles (and this similarly applies to the other views in Fig.7).<br>
Insofar as the resin temperature T of the obtained polyolefin-based resin composition is adjusted to a temperature which is not higher than Tsc, the polyolefin-based resin itself is not necessarily in a solid state, and may be in a molten state.<br>
If desired, however, the resin temperature T of the obtained strandmay be cooled to the crystallization temperature (hereinafter, referred to as "Tc") of the polyolef in-based resin composition or lower, for example, to room temperature or lower, and the resultant strand may be cut, giving pellets of the polyolefin-based resin composition (see (a3) of Fig. 7).<br>
In the pellets thus obtained, crystalline lamellae of the polyolefin-based resin have grown from the fibrous<br>
particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) . The wavy lines shown in (a3) of Fig. 7 schematically illustrate the crystal lamellae of the polyolefin-based resin {and this similarly applies to the other views in Fig. 7).<br>
The above process for producing pellets is the same as the process for producing pellets in molding method (II) that will be described later. <process for producing polyolefin-based resin molded products><br>
Preferable embodiments of the production process (molding method (I)) of the invention include, for example, one employing the following steps [1] to [5] . Hereinafter, these steps are described with reference to (I) of Fig. 7. While Fig. 7 shows a molding method comprising an injection step, a molding method comprising an extrusion step will also be described below.<br>
[1] First, as shown in (al) of Fig. 7, the<br>
crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention (or, components (A) and (B) and, if desired, polyolefin modifiers, etc.) is dissolved as uniformly as possible. The resin temperature T during this step is, for example, in the range of from 160 to 300°C in the case of using a polypropylene-based resin.<br>
[2] Next, as shown in (a2) of Fig. 7, the polyolefin-based resin composition is cooled to a resin temperature not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during<br>
cooling Tsc, whereby a network structure composed of fibrous particles of the amide-based compound is formed.<br>
Tsc shifts to higher temperatures with an increase in the content of the amide-based compound or with an increase in the proportion of trans-configured form of the stereoisomeric alkylcyclohexylamine reside constituting the amide-based compound(s).<br>
If required, as shown in (a3) of Fig. 7, the resin temperature T may be further lowered to a temperature which is equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature Tc of the polyolef in-based resin, and the polyolefin-based resin in the molten polyolefin-based resin composition is crystallized and pellets may be produced.  At this time point, the network structure of fibrous particles formed of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) is maintained in the pellets.<br>
13] In the invention, when amoldingmethodcomprising an injection step is adopted, the polyolefin-based resin composition (shown in (a2) of Fig. 7) containing a network structure of fibrous particles made of the amide-based compound is formed into pellets (shown in (a3) of Fig. 7) , and the obtained pellets are introduced from a hopper 2 of the injection molding machine 1. Subsequently, as shown in (a4) of Fig. 7, the injection molding is carried out under such conditions that the above-mentioned network structure is maintained, under<br>
specific temperature conditions (namely, Tsh) . By doing so, as shown in (a5) in Fig. 7, the minute fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) constituting the network structure are orientated by the shearing forces generated at the time of injection, especially by the shearing forces generated by the flow in the nozzle 4 of the injection molding machine 1 and by the flow in the mold 3.<br>
On the other hand, when a molding method comprising an extrusion step is adopted, the polyolefin-based resin composition (shown in (a2) of Fig. 7) containing the network structure of fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) does not need to be made into pellets and is subjected as it is to a molding method comprising an extrusion step under the specific temperature conditions, while the network structure is maintained. Alternatively, the polyolefin-based resin composition containing the network structure (shown in (a2) of Fig. 7) is made into pellets as shown in (a3) of Fig. 7, and the obtained pellets are subjected to a molding method comprising an extrusion step under the specific temperature conditions during which the network structure is maintained. By doing so, the minute fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) are orientated by the shearing forces generated during extrusion.<br>
The above-described specific temperature condition adopted in these molding methods are such that the resin temperature T is adjusted to a temperature not lower than the melting temperature Tm of the polyolefin-based resin, and not higher than the transition temperature of storagemodulus during heating Tsh of the polyolef in-based resin composition (i.e., Tm s T sfi Tsh) . Tsh shifts to higher temperatures with an increase in the content of the amide-based compound or with an increase in the proportion of the trans-configured form of the stereoisomeric alkylcyclohexylamine residue constituting the amide-based compound(s).<br>
Examples of the above-described specific<br>
temperature conditions are as follows. When at least one amide-based compound representedby General Formula (1) wherein R1 is a residue obtained by removing all of the carboxyl groups from 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid is used, the resin temperature T may generally range from 17 0 to 250 °C, particularly from 180 to 240°C. When at least one amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) wherein R1 is a residue obtained by removing all of the carboxyl groups from 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid is used, the resin temper a tureT may generally range from 180 to 280 °C, particularly from 190 to 270°C.<br>
[4] The molten polyolef in resin composition which has reached the mold in the molding method comprising an<br>
injection step is cooled by the mold, and thus the minute fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) remain orientated in the resin flow direction (see<br>
(a6) of Fig. 7).<br>
Similarly, the molten polyolefin resin composition which has reached a chill roll in the molding method comprising an extrusion step is cooled by the chill roll, and thus the minute fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) remain orientated in the resin flow direction.<br>
[5] Subsequently, the resin composition, shown in<br>
(a6) of Fig. 7, wherein the minute fibrous particles of the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) are orientated, is cooled to a temperature equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature (Tc) of the polyolefin-based resin, thereby causing crystallization of the polyolef in-based resin. Since the fibrous particles have been orientated, the polyolefin-based resin crystalline lamellae grown from the fibrous particles are also orientated during this step (see<br>
(a7) of Fig. 7) . The same also happens in the molding method comprising an extrusion step.<br>
During this step, the temperature of the mold or chill roll needs to be equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature Tc of the polyolefin-based resin. Preferably, the temperature may be, for example, in the range of 10 to 80°C.<br>
As a result, the polyolefin-based resin molded product obtained by the production process of the invention is characterized in that the crystalline lamellae of the polyolefin-based resin are orientated.<br>
As described above, molding method (I) of the invention utilizes the phenomenon that the amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) forms a network structure under the above-mentioned specific temperature conditions, and comprises conducting molding in a state in which the network structure is maintained (i.e. , at a temperature at which the fibrous particles forming the network structure do not dissolve or melt), thereby orientating the fibrous particles, and crystallizing the polyolef in-based resin in an oriented manner.<br>
As a result, the molding method (I) of the invention can provide amoldedproduct with excellent mechanical strength, particularly rigidity (flexural modulus).<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides, as described in Item 18 above, a process for producing a polyolef in-based resin molded product, the process comprising molding the resin composition of the invention at a resin temperature not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating.<br>
In this production process, it is preferable that R1 represents a residue obtained by removing all carboxyl groups<br>
from 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, and three R2 groups are the same or different and represent cyclohexyl or cyclohexyl substituted with one C1-4linear or branched alkyl (i.e. process of Item 19).<br>
In the production process (molding method (I)) , it is recommended that the amount of at least one amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) is preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolef in-based resin. Within this range, a significant improvement in rigidity can be observed. It is also possible to use the amide-based compound in an amount of more than 5 parts by weight.<br>
The above production process can produce a molded product having excellent rigidity, even when the amide-based compound of General Formula (1) alone is used (namely component (A) alone is used without using component (B)) . However, in order to improve rigidity and also in order to control the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin, it is preferable to use a fatty acid metal salt (component (B)).<br>
It is advantageous that the amount of the fatty acid metal salt (component (B)) is generally 0 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0 to 1 parts by weight, more preferably 0.005 to 0.5 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.01 to 0.3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolef in-based resin. Also, by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the<br>
component (A): component (B) weight ratio range of 100:0 to 30:70, the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be increased (end time of crystallization can be shortened) . <molding method><br>
When the resin temperature T exceeds Tsh (i.e. , Tsh 
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 8, when the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) T is set to a temperature that is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh (molding method (II) of Fig. 7) , the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin can be reduced (end time of crystallization can be prolonged) by increasing the proportion of the fatty acid metal salt (B) (region (IIA) -» region (IIAB)).<br>
By increasing the proportion of component (B), it is also possible to lower the crystallization temperature Tc of the polyolefin-based resin.<br>
The degree of decrease in crystallization rate and degree of lowering of crystallization temperature mainly depend on the combination of components (A) and (B) and the ratio of component (B) to component (A).<br>
Molding method (II) greatly improves the<br>
transparency of polyolef in-based resin molded products, and this effect is particularly noticeable in homopolypropylene resins and random polypropylene resins.<br>
In molding method (II) , an excessively high resin temperature T might deteriorate the resin, and therefore the resin temperature T is preferably not higher than 300°C, in particular not higher than 280°C.<br>
In such a resin temperature range, fibrous particles of the above-mentioned amide-based compound are melted or dissolved, and a network structure is not present.<br>
More specifically, according to molding method (II), as shown in (II) of Fig. 7, the molding is carried out at a temperature higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating Tsh, with no network structure being present, with the result that, upon cooling the molten resin composition, fibrous particles of the amide-based compound are formed and re-constitute a network structure, from which minute crystals (spherulites) of the polyolef in-based resin are formed, and consequently molded products having excellent transparency can be obtained.<br><process for producing polyolef in-based resin molded products> Hereunder, molding method (II) is explained in detail. Molding method (II) is also a process for preparing a molded product, the process being capable of controlling (reducing)<br>
the crystallization rate by the use of component (B).<br>
A preferable example of the molding method is desribed below with reference to (II) of Fig. 7, which is a diagram schematically illustrating a process for producing the polyolef in-based resin molded product (molding method) of the present invention.<br>
Note that the method for producing the<br>
polyolef in-based resin composition (production of pellets) as shown in (bl) to (b3) of (II) of Fig. 7 is the same as that shown in (al) to (a3) of (I) of Fig. 7 described with respect to the above-described molding method (I).<br>
As shown in (b4) and (b5) of Fig. 7, when the resin composition is molded while the resin temperature T is set to a temperature higher than Tsh, the resin composition is molded in a state such that the fibrous particles have been melted or dissolved and the network structure has disappeared.<br>
As a result, after an injection or extrusion step, the molten polyolef in-based resin composition reaches a mold or a chill roll with no network structure being present, and, as shown in (b6) and (b7) of Fig. 1, the molten polyolef in-based resin composition is cooled to a temperature not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during cooling Tsc, whereby a network structure is reconstituted. At this point, the resin composition is subjected to an injection or extrusion step, and therefore the network structure is slightly<br>
orientated, but the degree of the orientation is low.<br>
Since the degree of orientation of the fibrous particles is low as described above, the resulting molded product, obtained by cooling the polyolefin-based resin composition to a temperature equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature Tc, has a low degree of orientation of its crystalline lamellae, as shown in (b8) of Fig. 7.<br>
According to molding method (II) , it is possible to obtain a molded product having high transparency and containing a low amount of undispersed nucleating agent. Therefore, the present invention provides, as described in Item 17 above, a process for producing a polyolef in-based resin molded product, wherein the polyolef in-based resin composition of the invention is molded at a resin temperature higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating.<br>
In the above molding method (II) , the molding method may include molding methods comprising an injection step or an extrusion step. Such molding methods include injection molding, extrusion molding, injection blow molding, injection extrusion blow molding, injection compression molding, extrusion blow molding, extrusion thermo form molding, fiber production by melt spinning, etc.<br>
The effects of the invention (production of a molded product having high transparency and containing a low amount of undispersed nucleating agent) achieved by employing molding<br>
method (II) are produced when the weight ratio of component (A) : component (B) is preferably in the range from 100:0 to 30:70, preferably 95:5 to 30:70, more preferably 90:10 to 60:40, and particularly preferably 90 :10 to 70:30. By increasing the proportion of component (B) within this range, the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin can be reduced.<br>
In the above production process (moldingmethod (II)) as well, it is recommended that the amount of at least one amide-based compound (component (A)) represented by General Formula (1) is preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin-based resin. Within this range, a significant dLmprovement in transparency can be observed. It may be used in an amount of more than 5 parts.<br>
The above production process can produce a molded product having excellent transparency, even when the amide-based compound of General Formula (1) alone is used (namely component (A) alone is used without using component (B)) . However, in order to improve transparency and also in order to control the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin, it is preferable to use a fatty acid metal salt (component (B)).<br>
It is advantageous that the amount of the fatty acid metal salt (component (B)) is generally 0 to 5 parts by<br>
eight, preferably 0 to 1 parts by weight, more preferably 0.005 to 0.5 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.01 to 0.3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyolef in-based resin. Also, by increasing the proportion of component (B) within the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio range of 100 :0 to 30:70, the crystallization rate of the polyolef in-based resin can be decreased (end time of crystallization can be extended).<br>
As is clear from the above description of method (I) and method (II) , by using component (A) in combination with component (B) in a specific ratio, it is possible in the present invention to control the crystallization rate of a polyolef in-based resin during molding of the polyolef in-based resin composition of the invention. Thus, the invention also provides the use of a composition comprising component (A) and component (B) having a weight ratio of component (A) : component (B) in the range of 100:0 to 30:70 for controlling the crystallization rate of a polyolefin-based resin during the molding of the polyolefin-based resin.<br>
Polyolefin-based resin molded product<br>
The molded product of the present invention can be obtained by molding a polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention by a conventional molding method insofar as the conditions required for molding methods (I) and (II) are used.<br>
Because it is possible to control the crystallization rate of the polyolefin-based resin composition of the invention, any known method, such as injection molding, extrusion molding, blow molding, pressure forming, rotational molding, sheet molding or filmmolding, can be employed as the method for molding the polyolef in resin composition. The processing conditions may be suitably selected from the wide range of conditions that have been employed to date.<br>
When molding method (II) is employed, molded products having excellent transparency can be obtained. When molding method (I) is employed, molded products having excellent rigidity can be obtained.<br>
A polyolef in-based resin molded product obtained by molding method (I) , in particular, a molded product obtained by using a generally-used ethylene-propylene random copolymer (especially, one having an ethylene content of about 2 to 4 wt. % with the balance being propylene) , a propylene homopolymer or an ethylene-propylene block copolymer (especially, one having an ethylene content of about 5 to 15 wt. % and the balance being propylene), and at least one amide-based compound represented by General formula (1) , has a degree of orientation of 2 or more (particularly 2 to 10) , as defined by the ratio of the (040) reflection intensity to the (110) reflection intensity measured by wide-angle X-ray diffractometry, and exhibits significantly high rigidity. The degree of<br>
orientation is measured as follows:<br>
The X-ray diffraction intensity is measured according to conventional symmetrical reflection X-ray diffrac tome try using a centralized optical system that rotates while maintaining the relationship 8-26 wherein 6 is an incident angle of an X-ray relative to the surface of the sample of the injection molded product and 26 is a diffraction detection angle. The thus obtained X-ray diffraction intensity pattern is then subjected to peak-separation between amorphous halo peaks and crystalline peaks, and the degree of orientation is obtained from the ratio of the peak in tensity of the (040) plane reflection (26 = about 16.6°) to the peak intensity of the (110) plane reflection (26 = about 13.9°) with respect to polypropylene crystals using the following formula (F):<br>
Degree of orientation = I(040)/I(110)   (F)<br>
wherein I(11o) represents the peak intensity (cps) due to the (110) plane reflection and I(040) represents the peak intensity (cps) due to the (040) plane reflection.<br>
The polyolef in-based resin composition obtained by molding method (I) of the invention can impart excellent rigidity to a polyolef in-based resin moldedproduct. This also contributes toward making molded products thin and light-weight.<br>
The thus-obtained polyolefin in resin molded products of the invention can be suitably used in the fields in which<br>
polyolef in resin molded products containing metal phosphates, aromatic carboxylic acid metal salts, benzylidene sorbitols, etc., as nucleating agents, are used. Specific examples include medical instruments sterilized by heat, radiation or the like, such as disposable syringes, infusion and transfusion sets, blood collection equipment, etc.; packaging materials for foods, plants, etc. , sterilized by radiation or the like; cases such as cases for clothing, containers for storing clothing, etc.; cups for heat-packed foods, packaging containers for retort-processed foods; containers for use in microwave ovens; cans, bottles, etc., for beverages, such as juice, tea, etc., cosmetics, medicines, shampoos, etc.; containers and cups for seasonings such as miso, soy sauce, etc.; cases and containers for food stuffs such as water, rice, bread, pickles, etc.; sundries such as cases for use in refrigerators, etc.; stationeries; electrical and mechanical parts; automobile parts, etc.<br>

Using a differential scanning calorimeter (product name "DSC7", product of Perkin Elmer, Inc.), the peak temperature of the exothermic peak was measured according to JIS K-7121 except that a measurement sample (sample weight = lOmg; prepared by cutting the molded product (test piece) obtained in each Example or Comparative Example) was heated to a resin temperature at which the molding of the polyolef in-based resin composition had been carried out, and kept at the same temperature for 3 minutes.<br>
The higher the crystallization temperature (Tc) , the shorter the molding cycle can be.<br>
(2)	End time of crystallization (min.) (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "Te")<br>
Using a differential scanning calorimeter (product name "DSC7", product of Perkin Elmer, Inc.), a measurement sample (sample weight = lOmg; prepared by cutting the molded product (test piece) obtained in each Example or Comparative Example) was heated at a heating rate of 200°C/min. to a resin<br>
temperature at which the molding of the polyolef in-based resin composition had been carried out, and, after reaching this temperature, the resin composition was maintained at this temperature for 3 minutes. The resin composition was then quenched at a cooling rate of 100°C/min. to a measurement temperature at which the "end time of crystallization" was measured (isotactic ethylene-propylene random copolymer resin: 120°C, isotactic homopolypropylene resin and ethylene-propylene block copolymer resin: 130°C), and the polyolefin-based resin was subjected to isothermal crystallization. Note that the start time for measuring the "end time of crystallization" was the point at which the temperature reached said measurement temperature after the quenching.<br>

((d) of Fig. 1) in the longer time side of the exothermic peak where the tangential line has a maximum slope, and the time corresponding to the intersection point is defined as "end time of crystallization" (min.) . The longer the "end time of crystallization", the longer the time over which composition can be molded.<br>

The haze value of test piece having a size of 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 mm obtained in each Example or Comparative Example was measured according to JIS K-7136 (2000) using a haze meter (product of Toyo Seiki Seisakusho) . The smaller the measured value, the higher the transparency.<br>
(4)	Dispersibility (number of white spots)<br>
Ten test pieces (each 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 mm) obtained in each Example or Comparative Example were visually observed for white spots causedby undispersed or undis solved amide-based compound, and the average number of white spots per test piece was calculated and evaluated based on the following criteria. Evaluation: average number of white spots<br>

Temperature conditions:<br>
(i) Transition temperature of storage modulus during cooling (Tsc) : This temperature was measured by maintaining the polyolefin-based resin composition (pellets) at 250°C (or at 280°C for Examples in which BTC-2MeCHA was used, or at 260°C for Examples in which PTC-2MeCHA [100] or PTC-2MeCHA (100) was used) for one minute and cooling the resin composition to 150 °C at a cooling rate of 5°C/min.<br>
(ii) Transition temperature of storage modulus during heating (Tsh) : This temperature was measured, after measuring the transition temperature of storage modulus during cooling, by re-heating the polyolefin-based resin composition to 250 °C (or to 280°C for Examples in which BTC-2MeCHA was used, or to 260°C for Examples in which PTC-2MeCHA [100] or PTC-2MeCHA (100) was used) at a heating rate of 5°C/min.

The X-ray diffraction intensity pattern obtained by the method described in (7) above was subjected to separation<br>
of crystalline peaks from amorphous halo, and the degree of orientation was obtained from the ratio of the peak intensity of the (040) plane reflection (28 = about 16.6°) to the (110) plane reflection (20 = about 13.9°) of the polypropylene resin using the following formula (F): Degree of orientation = I(040)/I(iio) (F)<br>
wherein I(iio&gt; represents the peak intensity (cps) of the (110) plane reflection and I<o4o> represents the peak intensity (cps) of the (040) plane reflection.<br>
The greater the degree of orientation, the greater the orientation of the polyolefin crystals.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The following observations are clear from the results shown in Tables 1 and 2. (1) End time of crystallization<br>
When the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating (i.e. , T&gt; Tsh) , it is possible to reduce the crystallization rate (i.e. , to prolong the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin by controlling the component (A): component (B) ratio, particularly by increasing the proportion of component (B) (see Examples 1-3, Example 17, Examples 21-23).<br>
Fatty acid metal salts according to the invention, other than calcium stearate, can similarly reduce the crystallization rate (i.e., prolong the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin (see Examples 4-8, Examples 14-16).<br>
Amide-based compounds according to the invention, other than PTC-2MeCHA, can similarly reduce the crystallization rate (i.e., prolong the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin (see Examples 9-13, Examples 18-20 and Examples 27-33).<br>
However, when polyethylene wax, stearyl alcohol, or glycerol stearate is used in combination with an amide-based compound, contribution of such additives toward controlling the crystallization rate (controlling the end time of<br>
crystallization) of the polyolefin-based resin is much less significant, compared with the use of the fatty acid metal salt according to the invention (see Examples 24-26).<br>
(2)	Crystallization temperature<br>
When the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating (i.e., T&gt; Tsh), the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the present invention, can also lower the crystallization temperature of the polyolefin-based resin, in addition to the above advantages, by selecting the combination of components (A) and (B) and the component (A) : component (B) ratio (see Examples 1-5, Examples 9-10 and Examples 14-17).<br>
(3)	Haze value and dispersibility<br>
By using a crystallization rate-controlling composition of the invention comprising an amide-based compound together with a fatty acid metal salt (in particular, a fatty acid bivalent metal salt) , the solubility and dispersibility in a polyolefin-based resin are improved. Therefore, molded products obtained by molding the resulting polyolefin-based resin compositions have a low amount of undispersed nucleating agent (see Examples 1-5, Examples 8-17 and Example 19).<br>
Also the molded products obtained by molding such polyolefin-based resin compositions of the invention have much more improved transparency, compared with the transparency<br>
achieved in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 that will be described later, and especially the use of a crystallization rate-controlling composition comprising an amide-based compound prepared from 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid and 2-methylcyclohexylamine imparts excellent transparency, (see Examples 1-8, Examples 12-17, Comparative Examples 1 and 2) .<br>

fatty acid metal salt, the solubility and dispersibility in a polyolefin-based resin are improved. Therefore, molded products obtained by molding the resulting polyolef in-based resin compositions have a low amount of undispersed nucleating agent (see Examples 34-38).<br>
Also the molded products obtained by molding such polyolefin-based resin compositions have much more improved transparency, compared with the transparency achieved in Comparative Examples 3 and 4 that will be described later (see Examples 34-38, Examples 39-41 and Comparative Examples 3 and 4).<br>

The following observations are clear from the results shown in Table 4. (1) End time of crystallization<br>
With respect to b-PP as well as r-PP mentioned above, when the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, it is possible to reduce the crystallization rate (i.e. , to prolong the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin by controlling the component (A) : component (B) ratio, particularly by increasing the proportion of component (B)(see Examples 42-47 and Examples 48-51). (2) Crystallization temperature<br>
With respect to b-PP as well as r-PP mentioned above, when the resin temperature duringmolding (molding temperature) is higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the present invention can also lower the crystallization temperature of the polyolef in-based resin by selecting the combination of components (A) and (B) and the component (A) : component (B) ratio (see Examples 42-47). (3) Flexural modulus<br>

have improved flexural modulus, compared with that achieved in Comparative Examples 5 and 6 that will be described later (see Examples 42-51 and Comparative Examples 5 and 6).<br>

(Table Removed)The following observations are clear from the results shown in Tables 5.<br>
(1)	End time of crystallization<br>
When the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, it is possible to increase the crystallization rate (i.e. , to shorten the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin by controlling the component (A): component (B) ratio, particularly by increasing the proportion of component (B) (see Examples 52-54, Examples 64-66).<br>
Fatty acid metal salts according to the invention, other than calcium stearate, can similarly increase the crystallization rate (i.e., shorten the end time of crystallization) of a polyolefin-based resin (see Examples 55 and 56) .<br>
In polyolefin-based resins, other than r-PP, the crystallization rate can be increased (i.e. , the end time of crystallization can be shortened) (see Examples 57-62 , Examples 67 and 68).<br>
(2)	Crystallization temperature<br>
In addition to the above effects, when the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolefin-based resin and<br>
not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, the polyolefin-based resin compositions containing the crystallization rate-controlling composition of the present invention have a crystallization temperature which is not substantially lowered, compared with that achieved by the polyolefin-based resin composition containing the crystallization rate-controlling composition wherein the component (A) : component (B) weight ratio is 100: 0 in molding method (II) . This means that the high crystallization rate is maintained (see, for example, Examples 52-56, Examples 64-66 and Examples 21-23 with respect to r-PP). (3) Flexural modulus<br>
When the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, the molded products prepared by molding the polyolefin-based resin compositions of the invention have excellent rigidity. This improvement in rigidity is remarkable, when compared with the molded products obtained according to molding method (II) mentioned above (see Examples 52-69, Examples 42-51 and Comparative Examples 1-6).<br>
Amide-based compounds according to the invention, other than PTC-2MeCHA, can similarly improve the rigidity of the molded products (see Example 63 and Example 69).141-(4) Degree of orientation<br>
When the resin temperature during molding (molding temperature) is not lower than the melting temperature of the polyolefin-based resin and not higher than the transition temperature of storage modulus during heating, the molded products prepared by molding the polyolefin-based resin compositions of the invention had a degree of orientation of at least 2 . In contrast, the molded products obtained according to molding method (II) mentioned above had a degree of orientation of lower than 2 (see Examples 52-69, Examples 42-51 and Comparative Examples 1-6).<br>

Production Example 1-1In a four-necked 500 ml flask equipped with a s tirrer, a thermometer, a condenser and a gas inlet were placed 9.7 g (0.055 mol) of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid (PTC) and 100 g of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature to completely dissolve PTC. Subsequently, 20.5 g (0.18 mol) of<br>
2-methylcyclohexylamine (trans isomer : cis isomer = 100: 0, GLC composition ratio) , 56.3 g (0.18 mol) of triphenylphosphite, 14 .4 g (0.18 mol) of pyridine and 50 g of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were added thereto, and the reaction was carried out with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 4 hours at 100 ° C. After cooling, the reaction mixture was slowly poured into a mixture of 500 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 500 ml of water, and the resulting mixture was stirred at about 40°C for one hour, and the white precipitate thus formed was then filtered off. The obtained white solid was washed twice with 500 ml of isopropyl alcohol at about 40°C, and dried at 100°C and 133 Pa for 6 hours .<br>
The obtained dry product was ground in a mortar and passed through a standard sieve (JIS Z 8801) having openings of 106 |w to give 20.3 g (80% yield) of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid<br>

1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(2-methylcyclohexyl-<br>

The unreacted 2-methylcyclohexylamine recovered from the above amidation reaction was subjected to GLC analysis. It was found that the trans:cis ratio of the unreacted amine was 74:26, which was in agreement with the trans : cis ratio (74:26, GLC composition ratio) of the 2-methylcyclohexylamine used as the starting material.<br>
The product amide obtained above, when heat-treated at 100°C, had a FT-IR spectrum and a melting point that were in agreement with those measuredbef ore the treatment, verifying that the stereoconfiguration of the 2-methylcyclohexylamine residue constituting the amide-based compound was not altered by the amidation reaction.<br>
In view of the above results, it was confirmed that the ratio of trans-configured 2-methylcyclohexylamine residue : cis-conf igured2 -methylcyclohexylamine residue of the product amide-based compound of this Production Example 1-2 was identical to the trans: c-18 is ratio of the starting material amine.

When the product amide compound was checked for the stereoconf iguration in the same manner as in Production Example 1-2, it was confirmed that the ratio of trans-configured moiety :cis-configured moiety of the product amide-based compound was identical to the trans: cis ratio of the starting material amine.
