BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS	<br><br>
The invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a first embodiment of a circuit breaker in accordance with the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a second embodiment of a circuit breaker in accordance with the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is shown a first circuit breaker 10 embodying the invention, which is for use in a power/load circuit formed a three-phase mains power supply 11 and a load 12 connected to the<br><br>
-6-<br>
power supply 11 by means of three live power lines R-R', s-S' and T-T' and a neutral power line N-N' . The circuit breaker 10 comprises a fault sensor circuit 20 associated with the power lines R-R', S-S', T-T' and N-N', first and second comparator circuits 4 0 and 50 connected separately to the fault sensor circuit 20 for fault detection and then providing a tripping signal, and a tripping circuit 60 connected to the comparator circuits 4 0 and 50 for breaking the power/load circuit in response to the tripping signal.<br>
The tripping circuit 60 is formed by a set of four  normally-opened switches SW1 connected in series with the respective power lines R-R', S-S', T-T' and N-N' facing the power supply 11, a solenoid SO for normally holding the switches SWl closed, and a silicon-controlled rectifier SCR1 connected in parallel with and for disabling (short-circuiting) the solenoid SO to open the switches SWl in order to disconnect the load 12 from the power supply 11. The tripping circuit 60 includes a full wave rectifier D for picking up power from the power nodes R and T to drive the solenoid SO via a micro switch SW2 and to drive the comparator circuits 4 0 and 50 via a zener diode D5 providing a voltage node V1, said circuits 40, 50 and 60 sharing a common ground E.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The fault sensor circuit 20 is formed by a combined voltage sensor/comparator 3 0 connected to the three live power lines R-R', S-S' and T-T' and by respective current sensing transformers Tl to T3 each having four primary windings P1 to P4 connected in series along respective power lines R-R', S-S', T-T' and N-N' at a position downstream of the switches SW1 and a secondary winding S1. The primary windings P1 to P4 of the transformer Tl are balanced for detecting, by itself, any intolerable earth leakage fault and, in combination with the voltage sensor/comparator 30, any intolerable phase voltage imbalance, including phase failure (missing), in the power/load circuit for action by the comparator circuit 50.<br>
The primary windings P1 to P4 of the transformer T2 are made slightly unbalanced by means of resistors Rll and R12 connected in parallel with the primary windings P1 and P4 respectively. The primary windings P1 to P4 of the transformer T3 are made slightly unbalanced by means of resistors R13 and R14 connected in parallel with the primary windings P2 and P4 respectively. These two transformers T2 and T3 are for detecting any intolerable over-current,   including  short-circuit  fault,   in  the<br><br>
-8-<br>
power/load circuit for action by the comparator circuit 40.<br>
The voltage sensor/comparator 30 includes a pair of OP-AMP (operational amplifier) voltage comparators OA1 and 0A2 and a silicon-controlled rectifier SCR2. It has two inputs and a common node Y connected to respective live power lines R-R', S-S' and T-T' on the side of the transformers Tl to T3 facing the power supply 11 and an output connected to the live power line T-T' on the side of the transformers Tl to T3 facing the load 12. Thus, the voltage sensor/comparator 30 provides a circuit path X extending from the power nodes R and S to the power node T' across opposite sides of the power lines R-R', S-S' and T-T' with respect to and externally of the transformers Tl to T3 .<br>
The two inputs of the voltage sensor/comparator 30 are provided by respective comparators OA1 and OA2. Each comparator OA1 (or OA2) has a first input connected to a respective power node R (or S) by means of a diode-resistor-capacitor circuit D1-R1-C1 (or D2-R2-C2) across the power node R (or S) and the remaining power node T which provides the common node Y. The second input of each comparator OA1 (or OA2) is connected to the first input of the other comparator 0A2 (or 0A1) by means of respective<br><br>
-9-<br>
potential dividing resistors R3/R4 (or R5/R6) across the said first input and the common node Y. Accordingly, the inputs of the comparators OA1 and OA2 are cross connected the power lines R-R', S-S' and T-T'.<br>
In operation, each comparator 0A1 (or 0A2) senses a respective phase-to-phase voltage R-T -(or S-T) of the power supply 11, with a percentage of the same phase-to-phase voltage R-T (or S-T) being sensed by the other comparator 0A2 (or 0A1). Accordingly, the comparators 0A1 and 0A2 are arranged to cross compare one phase-to-phase voltage R-T {or S-T) with a percentage (the same percentage) of the other phase-to-phase voltage S-T (or R-T), covering all the three phases voltages R-S-T. While the three phase voltages R-S-T are balanced in a healthy condition, the voltage differences as sensed by both comparators 0A1 and 0A2 are equal and their logic outputs will be the same (at logic low) . In the event of an intolerable phase voltage imbalance (or a phase failure) in the power/load circuit, the voltage differences as sensed by the comparators 0A1 and 0A2 will change in opposite directions, with one voltage difference increasing while the other voltage difference decreasing. This will cause the logic output of one of the comparators 0A1 and 0A2 and in turn their<br><br>
-10-combined output to toggle (to logic high).<br>
The cross comparison by the comparators OA1 and OA2 between the two phase-to-phase voltages R-T and S-T is twice as sensitive compared with the comparison of either phase-to-phase voltage R-T or S-T against a fixed reference voltage.<br>
The rectifier SCR2 has an anode connected to the power nodes R and S by means of a common resistor R8 and respective diodes D3 and D4 (also for providing a voltage-node V2 for driving the comparators OA1 and OA2), a cathode acting as the output of the sensing comparator circuit 30 connected to the power node T', and a gate connected to the combined output of the comparators OA1 and OA2 for control. When the combined logic output of comparators OA1 and OA2 toggles to logic high, the rectifier SCR2 will be turned on and thus connect the two power nodes R and S to the power node T' via the aforesaid circuit path X externally of the transformers Tl to T3. This will simulate an earth leakage fault in the power/load circuit for the transformer Tl to detect and the comparator circuit 50 to provide a tripping signal as described above.<br>
The comparator circuit 40 is formed by an OP-AMP voltage<br><br>
-11-<br>
comparator OA3, an OP-AMP current integrator OA4, and resistors R43/R44/R45 acting as a potential divider connected across the voltage node V1 and the ground E. The comparator 0A3 and integrator 0A4 have respective first inputs connected together to a first end of the secondary windings S1 of the transformers T2 and T3, second inputs provided with respective reference voltages by means of the resistors R43/R44/R45, and a combined output connected to the gate of the rectifier SCR1 of the tripping circuit 60. The comparator OA3 and integrator OA4 serve to turn on the rectifier SCR1 in response to the transformers T2 and T3 detecting the occurrence of a short-circuit current or an intolerable overload current in the power/load circuit.<br>
The comparator circuit 50 is formed by an OP-AMP voltage comparator OA5 which has a first input connected to a first end of the seconding winding S1 of the transformer T1, a second input provided with a reference voltage by means of resistors R51/R52 acting as a potential divider connected across the voltage node V1 and the ground E, and an output connected to the gate of the rectifier SCR1 of the tripping circuit 60. The comparator OAS serves to turn on the rectifier SCR1 in response to the transformer Tl alone detecting the occurrence of any intolerable earth leakage<br><br>
-12-<br>
fault in the power/load circuit or the transformer Tl in combination with the voltage sensor/comparator 30 detecting the occurrence of an intolerable phase voltage imbalance or<br>
a phase failure.<br>
The second ends of the secondary windings S1 of all the transformers Tl to T3 are connected to the ground E.<br>
In the event of a circuit fault, under the control of the comparator circuits 40 and 50 in conjunction with the sensor fault circuit 20 as described above, the tripping circuit 60 will disconnect the load 12 from the power supply 11 through the opening of the switches SW1. The switches SW1 can only be re-closed manually after the circuit fault has been cleared. The types of circuit faults' that can be handled by the circuit beaker 10 comprise (1) phase voltage imbalance, (2) phase failure, (3) short-circuit current, (4) overload current and (5) earth fault leakage current.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second circuit breaker 100 embodying the invention, which is implemented and operates in a manner<br>
very similar to that of the first circuit breaker 10, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals.<br><br>
-13-<br>
The circuit breaker 100 has two major differences.<br>
The first difference lies in the provision of an additional line O-O' co-extending with the power lines R-R', S-S', T-T' and N-N' through the transformers Tl to T3, with the transformers Tl to T3 including respective fifth primary windings P5 connected in series along the line O-O'. Also, the output of the voltage sensor/comparator 30 is connected to the end O' of the line O-O', instead of the power node T' .<br>
The second difference lies in the rectifier SCR2 of	the<br>
voltage  sensor/comparator  30  being  connected with	its<br>
cathode to the common node Y and its anode acting as	the<br>
output of voltage sensor/comparator 30.<br>
