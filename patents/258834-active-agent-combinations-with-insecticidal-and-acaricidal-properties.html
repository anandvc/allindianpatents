				<td>Active compound combinations having insecticidal and acaricidal properties<br>
The invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising, firstly, known cyclic ketoenols and, secondly, further known insecticidally active compounds, which combinations are highly suitable for controlling animal pests, such as insects and unwanted acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenols have fungicidal, insecticidal and acaricidal properties (EP-A 0 528 156, EP-A 0 647 637, WO 95/26 345, WO 96/20196, WO 96/25395, WO 96/35664, WO 97/01535, WO 97/02243, WO 97/36868, WO 98/05638, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/23354 and WO 01/74770). The activity of these compounds is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
It is also known that mixtures of phthalamides and other bioactive compounds have insecticidal and/or acaricidal action (WO 02/087334). The action of these mixtures is not always optimal.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93/22297, WO 93/10083, DE-A 26 41 343, EP-A 0 347 488, EP-A 0 210 487, US 3,264,177 and EP-A 0 234 045). However, the action of these compounds is not always satisfactory.<br>
It has now been found that active compound combinations comprising compounds of the formula (I) (group 1)<br>

Very particular preference according to the invention is given to active compound combinations comprising compounds of the formula (I) or a compound of group 2 and at least one compound of the formula (H), where the individual radicals are a combination of the meanings listed above as being very particularly preferred.<br>
Saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals, such as alkyl or alkenyl, can in each case be straight-chain or branched as far as this is possible, including in combination with heteroatoms, such as, for example, in alkoxy.<br>
Optionally substituted radicals can be mono- or polysubstituted, where in the case of polysubstitution the substituents can be identical or different.<br>
In addition, the active compound combinations may also comprise further fungicidally, acaricidally or insecticidally active additives.<br>
If the active compounds in the active compound combinations according to the invention are present in certain weight ratios, the synergistic effect is particularly pronounced. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the combinations according to the invention comprise active compounds of the formula (I) or a compound of group 2 and the mixing partner of the formula (IT) in the preferred and particularly preferred mixing ratios given:<br>
The preferred mixing ratio is from 500:1 to 1:50.<br>
The particularly preferred mixing ratio is from 25:1 to 1:10.<br>
The mixing ratios are based on weight ratios. The ratio is to be understood as meaning active<br>
compound of the formula (I):mixing partner of the formula (II) or as ratio of a compound of group<br>
2:mixing partner of the formula (II).<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for controlling animal<br>
pests, preferably arthropods and nematodes,  in particular insects and arachnids, found in<br>
agriculture, in animal health, in forests, in the protection of stored products and materials and in<br>
the hygiene sector. They are active against normally sensitive and resistant species, and against all<br>

The active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, or else water.<br>

Synergists are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and stored-product pests, the active compound combinations are distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are not only active against plant<br>
pests, hygiene pests and stored-product pests, but also, in the veterinary medicine sector, against<br>
animal parasites (ectoparasites) such as hard ticks, soft ticks, mange mites, harvest mites, flies<br>

By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reductions in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like) should be diminished, so that more economical and simpler animal husbandry is possible by the use of the active compound combinations according to the invention.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a<br>
known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through method, suppositories, by parenteral administration such as, for example, by injections (intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneally and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal administration in the form of, for example, immersing or dipping, spraying, pouring-on, spotting-on, washing, dusting, and .with the aid of active-compound-comprising moulded articles such as collars, ear tags, tail tags, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, domestic animals and the like, the active compound combinations can be applied as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, flowables) comprising the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, either directly or after 100- to 10 000-fold dilution, or they may be used as a chemical dip.<br>

Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials such as, preferably, polymers, adhesives, glues, paper and board, leather, wood, timber products and paints.<br>
The material which is to be protected from insect attack is very particularly preferably wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention,<br>
or mixtures comprising it, are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
Construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, vehicles made of wood, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, chipboard, joinery, or timber products which quite generally are used in house construction or building joinery.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The abovementioned formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellant, if desired desiccants and UV stabilizers, and if desired colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for protecting wood and timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the species and the abundance of the insects and on the medium. The optimal quantity to be employed can be determined in each case by test series upon application. In general, however, it will suffice to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220Â°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220Â°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350Â°C, petroleum and aromatics with a boiling<br>
--range of 160 to 280Â°C, oil of turpentine, and the like are advantageously used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210Â°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220Â°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, can be replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, and that the mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced. Aliphatic organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like.<br>
Organochemical binders used for the purposes of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and which can be diluted in water and/or dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin employed as binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances may also be used as binders, in amounts of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellants, odor-masking agents, and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like, all of which are known per se, can be employed.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, as organochemical binders, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins which are preferably used in accordance with the invention are those with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulfonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones such as benzophenone and ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Other suitable solvents or diluents are, in particular, water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective timber protection is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example the vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can equally be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, in particular hulls, screens, nets, buildings, quaysides and signaling systems, against fouling.Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent stops in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., in particular fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations according to the invention have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which<br><br>
can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and parts of plants with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetic Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br>
-<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defense of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), corn, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to corn, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are the increased defense of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus Thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryfflB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, CrySBb and CryDF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defense of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors, as well as resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes in question which impart the desired traits can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are corn varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARDÂ® (for example corn, cotton, soya beans), KnockOutÂ® (for example corn), StarLinkÂ® (for example corn), BollgardÂ® (cotton), NucotnÂ® (cotton) and NewLeafÂ® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are corn varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup ReadyÂ® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example corn, cotton, soya bean), Liberty LinkÂ® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMIÂ® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STSÂ® (tolerance to sulfonylureas, for example corn). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name ClearfieldÂ® (for<br><br>
example corn). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still-to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, according to S.R. Colby, Weeds 15 (1967), 20-22:<br>
If<br>
X         is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active<br>
compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m ppm, Y         is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active<br>
compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and E         is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active.<br>
compounds A and B at application rates of m and n g/ha or in a concentration of m and n<br>
ppm,<br>
then<br>
X-Y<br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present, In this case, the actually observed kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected kill rate (E).<br><br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all animals have been killed; 0% means that none of the animals have been killed.<br>
