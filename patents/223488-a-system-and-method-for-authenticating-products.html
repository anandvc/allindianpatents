AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to an authentication system, in particular where products can be authenticated at their point-of-release, for instance, to a consumer or end user. For a patient, point-of-release could be dispensing by a pharmacist or other healthcare professional.<br>
In a number of industries, particularly the pharmaceutical industry, problems result from products being sold or dispensed which are counterfeit, have been fraudulently obtained or are merely faulty or out of date.<br>
Previously, industries have dealt with this problem by providing clearly marked packaging and controlling tightly the chains of distribution. More recently, supply chain industries have considered the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) and electronic product codes (EPC) for a replacement for standard bar codes. While standard bar codes, EPCs and/or RFID can include information that can be machine-read, for purposes of tracking, etc., the information used therein is not necessarily unique for the product. For example, a bar code carries general information about the product and/or the manufacturer, etc., but the same bar code with identical information is affixed or otherwise provided to multiple containers for the same type of product. Moreover, the information contained in RFID and/or EPC may not necessarily be unique to the product. See, generally, "RFID Changes Everything," E-Business Ecosystems, September 19, 2002. However, problems still arise and the present application recognises for the first time the possibility of implementing a system which provides authentication of individual products. These products may be packaged individually or together in packs and authentication can then be provided for each product separately, for instance,<br>
841306<br><br>
each tablet, vial, blister strip, etc. In this specification, "authentication" can be used to refer to products which may be subject to, e.g., recall, theft and/or expiration, etc.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a method of authenticating products at a trusted location including:<br>
housing the products in respective containers having respective unique product identifiers associated with data identifying the respective housed products;<br>
storing in an authentication database data relating to the products;<br>
reading at a trusted location terminal the data from one of the product identifiers;<br>
communicating at least some of the data of the product identifier to the authentication database;<br>
comparing data of the product identifier with data of the authentication database so as to produce an authentication result; and<br>
communicating the authentication result from the authentication database to the trusted location terminal.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is also provided an authentication system for authenticating products at a trusted location, the<br>
841306<br><br>
products being held in respective containers, each container including a respective unique product identifier, the system including:<br>
at least one terminal located at a trusted location of the product and for reading data from the respective product identifier;<br>
an authentication database to store data relating to the product identifier and the respective products; and<br>
a communication channel by which data read by the at least one terminal can be compared with data stored in the authentication database so as to authenticate the corresponding product.<br>
In this way, before a particular product, such as a pharmaceutical, is sold or dispensed, it is possible to authenticate that product. The trusted location will often be the point-of-release where the product is sold or dispensed. However, it could also be the point-of-receipt, for instance a trusted consumer or a retailer who will then sell or dispense the product.<br>
The product identifier can include merely data uniquely identifying the individual product, with data about the product identifier being stored in the authentication database. However, the container can be provided with data about the product itself. The product identifier can be incorporated into the container for example by embedding an identification device (carrying the product identifier) into a carton or foil blister pack or adhesion of the device or a label (such as bar code) to cartons, bottle labels or caps. The appropriate comparison of data can take place either at the authentication database or at the terminal.<br>
841306<br><br>
In this way, the system can determine whether or not the product is a genuine product or is a counterfeit. Similarly, if the product is out of date, faulty, intended for a different market or subject to recall, this can also be identified. As a result, if the product is not correctly authenticated, the sale or dispensing of the product can be inhibited.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to provide increased availability of products at points-of-dispensing/sale for the pharmaceutical industry, it is also possible to guarantee patients' safety with regard to counterfeit drugs and dispensing errors. Similarly, additional checks can be made at point-of-receipt.<br>
Because details of dispensing/sale of products can be provided back to the authentication database, it is also possible to achieve improved distribution control and management information. In particular, it is possible to provide improved forecasting (profit projection and stock control unit demand), reduced inventory along the distribution channel, more cost effective supply management and determining the length of time a product has been in the supply chain.<br>
As part of the system, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is also provided a container for housing a product for distribution and release, the container including a unique product identifier associated with data relating to the housed product and providing said data for reading by an external device.<br>
In one embodiment, the product identifier may be in the form of a number, e.g., a randomly generated number, a code, e.g., one or more bar codes that<br>
841306<br><br>
can be read/scanned by a scanner or other reading device at the point-of-sale terminal. The product identifier, e.g., may take the form of an RFID, unique ink (e.g., having a unique frequency, e.g., UV), magnetics, etc.<br>
In another embodiment, the product identifier may be stored or otherwise available through a product identification device, e.g., one or more tagging devices including unique product identity codes that can be read/scanned by and/or input into the terminals. The container may include additional identification devices and/or bar-codes, in which event the terminals can read/scan both the identification devices/bar-codes and the product identifiers.<br>
Thus, preferably, besides the unique product identifier, the terminals are also capable of reading standard prior art bar codes on the container which convey general information about the product and/or manufacture, but are not unique to the specific product.<br>
Information from the product identifier, e.g., a number, bar-code, etc., can be provided via the communication channel to enable manufacturers, suppliers and the like to be informed automatically of the particular product for which authentication was not possible. This relieves the operator of the point-of-release, for instance a pharmacist, of the responsibility of informing the supplier. It will be appreciated that even counterfeit products are often provided with bar-codes and these codes will identify the type of product.<br>
In this way, the product can be identified for authentication as part of the system.<br>
841306<br><br>
The product identifier and/or identification device, etc. can be incorporated into the container for example by embedding it in a carton or foil blister pack or adhesion to cartons, bottle labels or caps.<br>
Preferably the container is arranged to be opened in a predetermined manner and the product identifier and/or identification device, etc. is arranged to indicate that the container has been opened.<br>
This prevents any tampering with the product, thereby further enhancing the authentication process.<br>
The container, e.g., by way of the identification device, may be provided with some form of sensor for detecting and recording that the container has been opened. However, preferably, the product identifier or identification device, etc. is formed in or on the container such that opening the container at least partly destroys such.<br>
Partly destroying the product identifier or identification device, etc., can be arranged to provide a signal that the container has been opened. Alternatively, the product identifier or identification device can be rendered completely inoperable such that the external reading device cannot detect the product identifier or identification device and, hence, cannot authenticate the housed product. In some embodiments, a partly destroyed product identifier or identification device could be reactivated by the manufacturer for investigation purposes.<br>
Preferably, the product identifier includes data indicating a unique product identity code but no other information about the product. Optionally the<br>
841306<br><br>
identification device or label/bar code in which the product identifier is provided can additionally include one or more of the following types of exemplary information:<br>
the nature or type of product housed in the container;<br>
the date of manufacture of the product;<br>
the name of the manufacturer;<br>
the place of manufacture of the product;<br>
the date of housing the product in the container;<br>
the sell-by date;<br>
the use-by date; and<br>
special instructions, e.g. contra-indications or warnings.<br>
Of course, the identification device could include other information.<br>
This information can be used to determine whether or not the product is suitable for sale or dispensing, preferably in conjunction with information provided by the authentication database.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, such data may be stored in the authentication database and accessed by reference to data associated with the product identifier and/or identification device identifying the corresponding respective product.<br>
Optionally, the container, e.g., by way of the identification device, includes at least one sensor for environmental conditions including one or more of temperature and humidity and stores data from which it can be determined if<br><br><br>
