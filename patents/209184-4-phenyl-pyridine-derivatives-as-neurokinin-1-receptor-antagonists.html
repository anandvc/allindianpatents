4-PHENYL-PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES AS NEUROKININS RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br><br>
-NH(CH2)2OH) -NR3C(0)CH3 or-NR3C(0)-cyclopropyl;<br>
R"     is methyl or chloro;<br>
R*      is hydrogen or methyl;<br>
R      is hydrogen or -(CHa^OH; and<br>
n       is 1 or 2<br>
and to pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
Compounds, similar to those described in the present application, have been described in EP 1035115.<br>
The compounds of formulas 1A and IB and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic properties. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the<br><br>
latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.  •<br>
The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a number of diverse biological processes.<br>
The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease (Neurosci. Res., 1996,7,187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and depression (Science, 1998, 281,1640-1645).<br>
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", J. Auton. Pharmacol., 13,23-93,1993.<br>
Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).<br>
The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment of induced vomiting.<br>
In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195,1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist.<br>
Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmunologic or a psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor antagonist.<br><br>
The usefulness of neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of certain forms of urinary incontinence is further described in "Neuropeptides, 32(1), 1-49, (1998)" and "Eur. J. Pharmacol, 383(3), 297-303, (1999)".<br>
The compounds of formulas IA and IB can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in adsorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>

The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of certain depressive disorders or emesis by the administration of NK-1 receptor antagonists. A major depressive episode has been defined as being a period of at least two weeks during which, for most of the day and nearly every day, there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all, or nearly all activities.<br>

wherein the definition of substituents is given above,<br>
and<br>
if desired, converting the compound obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.<br>
In accordance with process variant a) DIPEA (N-ethyldiisopropyl-amine) is added to a mixture of a compound of formula II and a compound of formula III in dichloromethane and the mixture is stirred at temperatures between 35-40 °C. The desired compound of formula IB is isolated after purification in good yields.<br>
Process variant b) describes the reaction of a compound of formula IV with a compound of formula V to a compound of formula IA.

THF	tetrahydrofliran<br>
TMEDA	NjNjN'jN'-tetramethylethylene diamine<br>
DIPEA	N-ethyldiisopropyl-amine<br>
KHMDS	potassium hexamethyldisilazide<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formulas IA and IB and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin<br>
1	(NK-1, substance P) receptor.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter.<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the NKi receptor was evaluated at human NKi receptors in CHO cells infected with the human NKi receptor (using the Semliki virus expression system) and radiolabelled with [3H] substance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %) leupeptin (8 |.ig / ml), MnCi2 (3 mM) and phosphoramidon (2 JIM). Binding assays consisted of 250 \xl of membrane suspension (1.25 xlO5 cells / assay tube), 0.125 \x\ of buffer of displacing agent and 125 \x\ of [3H]substance P. Displacement curves were determined with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered under vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min with PEI (0.3 %) with 2 x<br>
2	ml washes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The radioactivity retained on the filters was<br>
measured by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate in at least 2<br>
separate experiments.<br>
The affinity to the NK-1 receptor, given as pKi, is in the scope of 8.40 - 9.24 for the described compounds.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formulas IA and IB as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formulas IA and IB and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such<br>
r<br>
excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br><br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The'dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01 -20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1 - 10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7 - 1400 mg per day, preferrably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
