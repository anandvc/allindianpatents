				<td>ENCODING UPLINK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br>
TO DOWNLINK TRANSMISSIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communications, and in particular, to<br>
encoding uplink acknowledgments to downlink transmissions.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
One multiple carrier communication scheme transmits data through a number<br>
of orthogonal subcarriers. Examples of such systems, which typically require a high data rate,<br>
include wireless location area networks (LANs) and mobile Internet technologies. Typical<br>
multiple carrier communication schemes include orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM), discrete Fourier transform-spreading-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(DFT-S-OFDM or DFT-Spreading-OFDM) (also referred to as SC-FDMA), and orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA). Although OFDM and OFDMA can<br>
achieve a high transfer rate by keeping subcarriers orthogonal, such techniques often have a<br>
high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). DFT-S-OFDMA is a technique which may be<br>
implemented to overcome the PAPR problem, for example. DFT-S-OFDMA functions by<br>
first spreading signals with a DFT matrix in the frequency domain before generating OFDM<br>
signals. The signals which were spread may then be modulated and transmitting in known<br>
fashion using conventional OFDM techniques. This technique will now be described.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowchart depicting the generation of a transmission signal _<br>
according to a conventional DFT-S-OFDMA system. According to blocks 110 and 120, a<br>
typical DFT-S-OFDM wireless communication system spreads signals using a DFT matrix<br>
before generating the OFDM signals. Consider an equation in which "s" is an input data -<br>
symbol, "x" is data spread in the frequency domain, and "Nb" is the number of subcarriers for<br>
a particular user. In such a scenario, the spread data "x" may be obtained using the<br>
following:<br><br>
According to blocks 130, 140, and 150, the spread vector "x" is shown<br>
mapped to a subcarrier according to a subcarrier mapping technique, and is then transformed<br>
into the time domain through an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) module to obtain a<br>
signal for transmission to a receiving entity. The transmission signal "y" may be obtained<br>
using the following:<br><br>
p<br>
where NxN is an NxN DFT matrix used to transform a frequency domain<br>
signal into a time domain signal. The signal "y" generated in this manner is transmitted with<br>
an inserted cyclic prefix (block 160).<br>
Data, pilots, and control information are then transmitted in the uplink of<br>
multiple carrier systems, including, for example, the DFT-S-OFDM system. Control<br>
information can be divided into data-associated control information, which is associated with<br>
data demodulation, and non-data-associated control information, which is not associated with<br>
data demodulation.<br>
Data-associated control information includes control information required to<br>
reconstruct data transmitted by user equipment (UE). For example, data-associated control<br>
information may include information associated with the transmit format or information<br>
associated with hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ). The amount of the data-associated<br>
control information can be adjusted according to an uplink data scheduling scheme.<br>
On the other hand, non-data-associated control information is control<br>
information required for downlink transmission. For example, the non-data-associated<br>
control information may include acknowledgment (ACK) or negative acknowledgment<br>
(NACK) information for HARQ operation, and a channel quality indicator (CQI) for link<br>
adaptation of the downlink.<br>
In an uplink multi-carrier or single-carrier FDMA system, control information<br>
is divided into a data-associated control information for demodulating user data and non-data-<br>
associated control information for downlink transmission. A basic principle of OFDM<br>
includes dividing a data stream having a high data rate into a plurality of data streams, each<br>
of which has a slow data rate, and then transmitting the data streams simultaneously using a<br>
plurality of camera. Each the carriers is referred to as a subcarrier. Since orthogonality<br>
exists between the carriers of OFDM, if frequency components of the carriers are overlapped<br>
with each other, a transmitting terminal can still detect the frequency components.<br>
The data stream having the high data rate is converted to a plurality of data<br>
streams having slow data rates via a serial to parallel converter. Each of the parallel-<br>
converted data streams is multiplied by a corresponding subcarrier, added together, and then<br>
transmitted to the receiving terminal.<br>
The parallel data streams generated, by the serial to parallel converter can be<br>
transmitted as a plurality of subcarriers by IDFT. IDFT can be efficiently implemented using<br>
an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT).<br>
As symbol duration of the subcarrier having the slow data rate increases,<br>
relative signal dispersion, which occurs by multi-path delay spreading, decreases on the time<br>
domain. Inter-symbol interference may be reduced by inserting a guard interval longer than<br>
the channel delay spreading between OFDM symbols. If a portion of an OFDM signal is<br>
copied to the guard interval and arranged at a start portion of the symbol, the OFDM symbol<br>
is cyclically extended to be protected.<br>
The amount of frequency resources used for data transmission may be reduced<br>
if the UE allocates a sufficient number of subcarriers to non-data-associated-control<br>
information when transmitting the control information in the uplink. This technique<br>
consequently results in a large number of subcarriers which are unable to be allocated, thus<br>
affecting the ability to achieve diversity gain in the frequency domain.<br>
A typical UE separately transmits ACK/NACK and CQI signals among non-<br>
data-associated control information in the uplink. For example, the UE transmits the<br>
ACK/NACK signal, the CQI signal, or both of these signals at a particular time period.<br>
However, conventional multiple carrier systems do not typically distinguish between such<br>
signals when processing the non-data-associated control information. This prevents efficient<br>
utilization of frequency resources.<br>
If ACK/NACK and CQI signals are transmitted using a single discrete Fourier<br>
transform (DFT) in the uplink of the DFT-S-OFDM communication system, a number of<br>
users will typically share the same resource unit. For instance, if one user transmits an<br>
ACK/NACK signal and another user transmits a CQI signal with the same resource unit, it<br>
may not be possible for a base station to demodulate the ACK/NACK and CQI signals of the<br>
two users.<br>

IWTAfT.F.n INSCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying<br>
drawing figures which form a part hereof, and which show by way of illustration specific -<br>
embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood by those of ordinary skill in this<br>
technological field that other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, electrical, as well<br>
as procedural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the<br>
drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.<br>
Various embodiments will be described in conjunction with a UE. However,<br>
such teachings apply also to other types of wireless terminals such as mobile terminals,<br>
mobile stations, and the like.<br>
Spreading of Control Information Vectors in Uplink<br>
Figs. 2A-2C are block diagrams which illustrate various elements of an uplink<br>
transmitting entity operable within a DFT-S-OFDM wireless communication system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Consider first a UE configured as<br>
the transmitting entity in such a communication system. The UE may receive and distinguish<br>
control information such as ACK/NACK, a channel quality indicator (CQI), and other types<br>
of non-data-associated control information. Such control information is not associated with<br>
data demodulation. Generally, an ACK/NACK is a vector that includes one or more bits<br>
which are based upon the number of cyclic redundancy codes (CRCs) inserted into the<br>
downlink signal. The CQI is a vector that generally includes a plurality of bits to report a<br>
channel quality state to an associated base station or Node B, for example. The CQI<br>
facilitates downlink scheduling at the base station. By way of non-limiting example,<br>
embodiments will be described in which the size of the ACK/NACK vector is "1" and the<br>
size of the CQI vector is "m."<br>
Fig. 2A shows a UE transmitting in the uplink to collectively spread the<br>
control information vectors (sized 1+m through DFT) to obtain a spread vector (X'ack+cqi)<br>
with a size of n bits (n=l+m), without distinguishing between the ACK/NACK vector of size<br>
1 and the CQI vector of size m. Another operation performs an inverse fast Fourier transform<br>
(IFFT) on vector (X"ack+cqi) obtained through subcarrier mapping to acquire and transmit<br>
time information (Yack+cql)-<br>
In this scenario, if one UE transmits an ACK/NACK and another UE transmits<br>
CQI using the same resource block, it is difficult for a receiving base station to select an<br>
IDFT for despreading a vector X'ack+cqi that is obtained by removing each subcarrier from a<br>
vector X"ack+cql- The vector X"ack+cqi. may be obtained by the base station through a fast<br>
Fourier transform (FFT) which corresponds to the IFFT performed at the transmitting end.<br>
Signals transmitted by the UEs are typically indistinguishably spread in the vector X"ack+cqi<br>
and the vector X'ack+cqi- This is because it may be necessary to distinguish between IDFTs<br>
used to analyze received signals from two or more UEs, if the UEs use the same resource<br>
block.<br>
Fig. 2B shows another arrangement for uplink transmissions in a DFT-S-<br>
OFDM wireless communication system according to an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A UE configured to transmit according to this figure distinguishes and<br>
receives various types of control information (described above). In this example, the UE<br>
spreads the ACK/NACK and CQI control information using different DFTs before mapping<br>
these parameters to corresponding subcarriers. Since the ACK/NACK vector (Xack) of size<br>
1 and the CQI vector (Xcqi) of size m are spread using different DFTs, their spread vectors<br>
(Xjack) and (X'cqi) of size 1 and m, respectively, also include ACK/NACK information and<br>
CQI information.<br>
The spread vectors (X'ack) and (X'cqi) are shown mapped to corresponding<br>
subcarriers, which are subjected to the IFFT and subsequently transmitted to the base station.<br>
According to this embodiment, if one UE transmits an ACK/NACK and another UE transmits<br>
CQI using the same resource block, the base station can easily select IDFTs for despreading<br>
vectors X'ack. and X'cqi that are each obtained by respectively removing subcarriers from<br>
vectors X"ack and X"cqi. The vectors X"ACk and X"cqi may be obtained by the base station<br>
through a FFT coiTesponding to the 1FFT that was performed at the transmitting end, which<br>
in the illustrated case is the UE.<br>
Fig. 2B is an example which distinguishes between control information such<br>
as ACK/NACK and CQI. However other types of information may be similarly<br>
distinguished using the illustrated techniques. For example, the techniques of this figure may<br>
also be applied to situations in which two or more control signals (or information) are<br>
received and spread using different DFTs before being mapped to a frequency resource for<br>
transmission through the uplink. This allows a receiving entity, which receives the uplink<br>
signal, to distinguish between the transmitted two or more types of control information<br>
through control information that is demapped from the frequency resource.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 2B separately spreads control information using<br>
separate DFTs, but alternatives are possible and envisioned by the present disclosure. For<br>
example, the separate DFT processes may alternatively include any process, provided that<br>
such processes allow the entity receiving the uplink signal to distinguish between the<br>
different types of control information.<br>
Fig. 2C shows another arrangement for uplink transmissions in a DFT-S-<br>
OFDM wireless communication system according to an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, the transmitting UE, for example, directly maps<br>
ACK/NACK control information to a subcarrier. This is accomplished without performing<br>
DFT, and results in obtaining the vector X"ack.- Fig. 2C further shows transforming CQI<br>
control information using a DFT, and then mapping the resulting spread vector X'cqi to a<br>
subcarrier to obtain a vector X"co&gt;<br>
Generally, the size of the vector corresponding to the ACK/NACK<br>
information is smaller than the size of the vector corresponding to the CQI information. Thus<br>
the effects achieved by spreading the vector corresponding to the ACK/NACK information<br>
are relatively small. This embodiment is simplified to the extent that the DFT processing of<br>
the ACK/NACK signal is omitted. However, this embodiment achieves effects similar to<br>
those of the case of Fig. 2B since the base station can correctly distinguish between<br>
information items that have been subjected to a FFT. If desired, the embodiment of Fig. 2C<br>
may alternatively include any separate process, other than the separate DFT spreading,<br>
provided that such a process allows the receiving entity to distinguish between the different<br>
types of control information.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 2C may farther include a structure for improving<br>
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. For example, if the ACK/NACK signal is<br>
directly mapped to a subcarrier without DFT, and it is then subjected to IFFT for transmission,<br>
the compensation effects between DFT and IFFT may degrade the PAPR performance<br>
(relative to performance which may be achieved by the configuration of Fig. 2B). As such, a<br>
UE configured in accordance with Fig. 2C may select a specific subcarrier for improving the<br>
PAPR performance, and then map the ACK/NACK signal to the selected subcarrier.<br>
Fig. 3A depicts an uplink subframe format using time division multiplexing<br>
(TDM) in a DFT-S-OFDM wireless communication system. Fig. 3B depicts an uplink<br>
subframe format using frequency division multiplexing (FDM) in a DFT-S-OFDM wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
Generally, ACK/NACK control information in a DFT-S-OFDM wireless<br>
communication system is represented by either one bit, or a relatively small number of bits.<br>
Consequently, the bit error rate (BER) may be somewhat degraded because of various factors<br>
in a wireless channel. Typical multiplexing methods in the DFT-S-OFDM wireless<br>
communication system include TDM (Fig. 3A) and FDM (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, a<br>
transmitting UE in accordance with an embodiment will typically repeatedly transmit<br>
ACK/NACK information to improve the BER.<br>
Consider the case in which TDM is used by several UEs. In such a scenario<br>
ACK/NACK information may be repeatedly transmitted in a long block (LB) allocated in a<br>
subframe (e.g., LB #3 of Fig. 3A) over a specific frequency. Such an arrangement will<br>
typically improve the BER characteristics.<br>
Repeated transmissions over a specific frequency may be accomplished by<br>
sequentially transmitting ACK/NACK information over a frequency band, or by mapping<br>
ACK/NACK information to a specific sequence. DFT may optionally be performed on this<br>
ACK/NACK information. If desired, ACK/NACK information may also be repeatedly<br>
transmitted using block coding.<br>
Consider now situations in which FDM is used to multiplex information<br>
transmitted from multiple UEs. In such scenarios, ACK/NACK information may be<br>
repeatedly transmitted in multiple LBs allocated in a subframe (e.g., LB #1 - LB #6 of Fig.<br>
3B). Such an arrangement will also typically improve the BER characteristics. In some<br>
cases, multiple ACK/NACK signals may be transmitted in response to downlink information<br>
using multiple antennas. In an embodiment, the number of ACK/NACK signals is equal to<br>
the number of CRCs inserted in the downlink data (as described above).<br>
A UE may responsively transmit (uplink) a number of ACK/NACK signals<br>
corresponding to the number of received CRCs for situations in which a CRC is inserted in<br>
each portion of information transmitted through each of the antennas in the downlink. If the<br>
UE transmits a plurality of ACK/NACK signals in this manner, the UE may also repeatedly<br>
transmit the ACK/NACK signals a specific number of times. Such operations may be used to<br>
improve BER characteristics of the transmitted ACK/NACK signals.<br>
For example, consider that the number of ACK/NACK signals is M. The M<br>
ACK/NACK signals may be denoted by ACK/NACKb ACK/NACK2,..., ACK/NACKm, and<br>
the specific number of times is K. In this case, the ACK/NACK signals may be repeatedly<br>
transmitted according to the following:<br>
{(ACK/NACKli, ACK/NACKi.2, ... ACK/NACK,.k), {(ACK/NACK2_,,<br>
ACK/NACK2-2,... ACK/NACK2-k).....(ACK/NACKm-i, ACK/NACKm-2, ... ACK/NACKm.<br>
According to an alternative technique, ACK/NACK signals may be repeatedly<br>
transmitted according to the following:<br>
{(ACK/NACKm, ACK/NACK2-1,... ACK/NACKm-i), {(ACK/NACKi_2,<br>
ACK/NACK2-2,... ACK/NACKm-2), .-., (ACK/NACKmc ACK/NACK2.k, - ACK/NACKm.<br>

Figs. 4A and 4B are block diagrams depicting techniques for reducing the<br>
BER in a transmitting UE operating within a DFT-S-OFDM wireless communication system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Consider first the situation in which<br>
the transmitting end transmits multiple ACK/NACK signals using multiple antennas, hi such<br>
a case, the transmitting end may transmit the ACK/NACK signals by performing block<br>
coding on these signals using, for example, the techniques shown in Figs. 4A and 4B.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4A, a technique is shown in which prior to transmitting,<br>
the ACK/NACK and CQI signals are first spread using separate DFTs. An alternative<br>
technique is shown in Fig. 4B. hi this figure, the ACK/NACK signals are directly mapped to<br>
a subcarrier without spreading these signals through a DFT. However, the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 4B includes mapping the CQI signal to a subcarrier after spreading this signal using a<br>
DFT.<br>
Multiple ACK/NACK signals for improving the PAPR and BER<br>
characteristics of ACK/NACK signals need not be directly transmitted, and instead may<br>
alternatively be mapped to a specific sequence to be transmitted. According to one<br>
technique, a specific sequence for mapping may be determined. A sequence may be selected<br>
and a plurality of ACK/NACK signals mapped to the sequence. If desired, the sequence may<br>
be selected as the specific sequence for mapping according to.its PAPR and BER<br>
characteristics. Another option includes transmitting ACK/NACK signals after modulating<br>
these signals using a conventional modulation technique such as BPSK or QPSK.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram depicting a method for selecting a subcarrier to be<br>
allocated according to an embodiment of the present invention. This technique selects the<br>
subcarrier based upon transmission status of the ACK/NACK. and CQI information and when<br>
such information is transmitted.<br>
Allocating a sufficiently large number of subcarriers to non-data-associated<br>
control information in the uplink may reduce the number of subcarriers necessary to transmit<br>
UE data. ACK/NACK and CQI information may be separately transmitted, as described<br>
above. However, frequency resources may be efficiently allocated if subcarrier allocation is<br>
also performed when both the ACK/NACK and CQI information is transmitted. This is<br>
particularly the case where, without discriminating between the cases where only the<br>
ACK/NACK information is transmitted, only the CQI information is transmitted or where the<br>
ACK/NACK and CQI information are simultaneously transmitted.<br>
Accordingly, a transmitting UE according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention may distinguish and receive ACK/NACK and CQI information, among non-data-<br>
associated control information, to identify whether each of the ACK/NACK and CQI<br>
information is transmitted. Based on this identification, the UE may allocate a subcarrier<br>
suitable for each case in which only the ACK/NACK information is transmitted, or where<br>
only the CQI information is transmitted, or where both the ACK/NACK and CQI information<br>
are simultaneously transmitted. This embodiment distinguishes between ACK/NACK and<br>
CQI information among non-data-associated control information to identify whether each of<br>
the ACK/NACK and CQI information is transmitted. This embodiment efficiently manages<br>
frequency resources, and permits allocation of increased amounts of frequency resources for<br>
transmission, thereby achieving frequency diversity.<br>
Advantages of various embodiments include the UE distinguishing<br>
ACK/NACK and CQI information, among non-data-associated control information which is<br>
not associated with data demodulation, and separately processing such information before it<br>
is mapped to frequency resources. This allows a base station to easily process received<br>
control information, even when the base station separately receives ACK/NACK and CQI<br>
information from multiple UEs through the same resource block. Moreover, improvement of<br>
the BER characteristics of the ACK/NACK information may be accomplished by repeatedly<br>
transmitting the ACK/NACK information in the uplink over a specific time period when<br>
FDM is employed, or over a specific frequency when TDM is employed.<br>
When multiple ACK/NACK signals are transmitted, improvement of the<br>
PAPR and/or BER characteristics may also be accomplished by performing processes on the<br>
transmitted ACK/NACK signals. Examples of such signals include block coding, mapping to<br>
a specific sequence, and modulation through BPSK or QPSK.<br>
Allocating Frequency Resource<br>
Additional alternative embodiments relate to allocating frequency resources<br>
for ACK/NACK transmissions in uplink multi-carrier or single-carrier (SC) FDMA systems.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an uplink subframe format. In this figure, a long block (LB) is used for data and<br>
control information transmissions, and a short block (SB) is used for pilot and data<br>
transmissions.<br>
Uplink transmission by the UE may be classified into the following cases:<br>
UE data, pilot, data-associated control;<br>
UE data, pilot, data-associated control, non-data-associated<br>
control; and<br>
Pilot, non-data-associated control.<br>
These cases may be multiplexed using, for example, the various multiplexing<br>
techniques shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. The subframe format of Fig. 6 includes multiplexing<br>
data-associated control information and non-data-associated control information with UE<br>
data, and simultaneously multiplexing non-data-associated control information of several<br>
UEs.<br>
In Fig. 7, although data-associated control information and UE data are<br>
multiplexed, a predetermined time-frequency domain is decided for the transmission of non-<br>
data-associated control information of several UEs. If UE data exists, non-data-associated<br>
control information is shown transmitted on the band for the transmission of UE data, instead<br>
of the band decided for the non-data-associated control information on which UE data is<br>
transmitted. A benefit of this technique is to maintain the SC-FDMA characteristics.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, band allocations of UE data and non-data-<br>
associated control are performed in the same manner. In particular, when the UE data<br>
corresponds to localized allocation, the localized allocation is applied to the non-data-<br>
associated control as well. However, ACK/NACK information among the non-data-<br>
associated control information has a size of one bit and is therefore unable to be channel<br>
coded. Consequently, iteration of the ACK/NACK information may be performed to obtain a<br>
specific eiror rate.<br>
Figs. 9A-9C depict embodiments which relate to allocating a frequency<br>
resource for ACK/NACK signal transmission in the uplink of a SC-FDMA/OFDMA system,<br>
and variations thereof. In general, there are two techniques for allocating a frequency<br>
resource in the uplink. The first technique being a distributed method of arranging<br>
transmission data with the same interval on entire frequency bands (Fig. 9A). The second<br>
technique being a localized method of arranging transmission data on a specific frequency<br>
band (Figs. 9B, 9C).<br>
Although the ACK/NACK signal is typically one bit in size, iteration of this<br>
signal may be performed to obtain a specific error rate. For example, consider that the<br>
ACK/NACK signal obtained from iteration is transmitted via N resource units (RU). In<br>
transmitting the ACK/NACK signal iterated using a localized method though N RUs, if the<br>
ACK/NACK is smaller than a frequency resource occupied by the N RUs, the two additional<br>
methods may also be implemented. One technique is to allocate an iterated ACK/NACK<br>
signal to continuous frequency resources, while the other technique is to arrange the<br>
AGK/NACK signal on N RUs using, for example, an even interval. Accordingly, techniques<br>
for allocating frequency resources for ACK/NACK transmission may be summarized as<br>
follows:<br>
- Distributed;<br>
- Localized;<br>
- Pure localized; and<br>
- Distributed within allocated frequency resources.<br>
Multiple codeword ACK/NACK<br>
Yet another embodiment relates to HARQ in a mobile communication system,<br>
and more particularly, to an apparatus for transmitting ACK/NACK signal in a multiple<br>
codeword (MCW) type MIMO wireless system. As will be described, this embodiment is<br>
suitable for a wide scope of applications including, for example, transmitting the<br>
ACK/NACK signal using multiple MCW type transmitting and receiving antennas.<br>
In general, multiple transmitting and receiving antennas may be used to raise<br>
the data rate in a mobile communication system. Data transmission using multiple antennas<br>
may be accomplished using two primary techniques. First, data may be transmitted in a<br>
transmit diversity format. In this case, although a data rate is not raised, a signal to noise<br>
ratio (SNR) of a received signal is raised to enable stable operation. This is because the same<br>
data is transmitted via several antennas. The second technique includes transmitting data in a<br>
spatial multiplexing format. In this case, simultaneously transmitting several independent<br>
data streams raises the data rate. The transmit diversity transmission is efficient in an area<br>
having a low SNR, whereas the spatial multiplexing transmission is efficient in an area<br>
having a high SNR.<br>
Figs. 10A and 10B are block diagrams depicting SCW and MCW transmitting<br>
terminals configured for use in a MIMO wireless mobile communication system. It is<br>
understood that in some situations, a plurality of data streams can be simultaneously<br>
transmitted. For instance, coding may be performed by one channel encoder, and then the<br>
data is divided into a plurality of data streams. This technique is often referred to as<br>
transmitting using a single codeword (SCW).<br>
Fig. 11 is a block diagram of an ACK/NACK transmitting apparatus according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. This example provides a technique for<br>
transmitting multiple streams which includes individually coding a plurality of data streams<br>
via a channel encoder, and then transmitting the encoded data streams via a plurality of<br>
transmitting and receiving antennas. This technique is often referred to as transmitting using<br>
a multiple codeword (MCW).<br>
SCW techniques include coding one block which is then divided. Since one<br>
CRC for error checking is attached to each block, a receiver would typically transmit only<br>
one ACK/NACK signal. On the other hand, using MCW, several blocks are coded and then<br>
turned into a data stream. If CRC is attached per block, the ACK/NACK signal should be<br>
transmitted for each data stream.<br>
In general, the MCW is able to obtain a data rate higher than that of the SCW.<br>
Consequently, the MCW is commonly used despite the increase'of ACK/NACK information<br>
to be transmitted. However, in situations in which the MCW transmits an ACK/NACK<br>
signal for each data stream, a receiver should secure radio resources for a plurality of<br>
ACK/NACK transmissions. This increase of control information decreases radio resources<br>
for the data transmission, resulting in degraded system efficiency.<br>
Various aspects and embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described. In general, these examples include an apparatus for transmitting ACK/NACK<br>
signals in MCW type MIMO wireless system. For example, an apparatus for transmitting<br>
ACK/NACK signals in a MCW type MIMO wireless system by which a number of<br>
ACK/NACK signals to be transmitted can be reduced by maintaining a high data rate MCW.<br>
One aspect includes transmitting an ACK/NACK in a wireless communication<br>
system using a plurality of MCW type transmitting and receiving antennas. Various<br>
operations include generating a plurality of ACK/NACKs corresponding to a number of error<br>
detection codes inserted in a plurality of data streams received via a plurality of antennas, and<br>
generating an ACK/NACK by combining a plurality of the ACK/NACKs, and transmitting<br>
the generated ACK/NACK via the antenna.<br>
Another aspect includes generating a plurality of ACK/NACKs corresponding<br>
to a number of error detection codes inserted in a plurality of data streams received via a<br>
plurality of antennas, and grouping a plurality of the ACK/NACKs. The method further<br>
includes generating one ACK/NACK per group by combining a plurality of the grouped<br>
ACK/NACKs into a plurality of such groups, and transmitting the generated ACK/NACK<br>
groups via the antenna.<br>
One aspect includes, in the grouping operation, grouping a plurality of the<br>
ACK/NACKs according to types of corresponding data streams.<br>
Another aspect utilizes the error detection code as a CRC code.<br>
Yet another aspect includes transmitting the received data streams for one<br>
timeslot via a plurality of the transmitting antennas.<br>
Still yet another aspect includes combining a plurality of the ACK/NACKs by<br>
an AND operation.<br>
In an embodiment, an apparatus for transmitting an ACK/NACK in a wireless<br>
communication system using a plurality of MCW type transmitting and receiving antennas<br>
includes an error checking unit generating a plurality of ACK/NACKs corresponding to a<br>
number of error detection codes inserted into a plurality of data streams received via a<br>
plurality of antennas. The apparatus further includes a signal combining unit generating one<br>
ACK/NACK by combining a plurality of the ACK/NACKs, and a signal transmitting unit<br>
transmitting the generated ACK/NACK via the antenna.<br>
In another aspect, an apparatus includes a control unit grouping a plurality of<br>
the ACK/NACKs, a signal combining unit generating one ACK/NACK per group by<br>
combining a plurality of the grouped ACK/NACKs into a plurality of groups, and a signal<br>
transmitting unit transmitting the generated ACK/NACK groups via the antenna.<br>
According to an aspect, the control unit groups a plurality of the ACK/NACKs<br>
according to the types of corresponding data streams.<br>
One aspect utilizes the error detection code as an CRC code, and the received<br>
data streams are transmitted for one timeslot via a plurality of the transmitting antennas, and<br>
the signal combining unit combines a plurality of the ACK/NACKs by an AND operation.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 11, a receiving terminal includes a plurality of antennas.<br>
When independent data is transmitted via a plurality of antennas to achieve a high data rate,<br>
the number of antennas of a receiving terminal should be equal to or greater than that of the<br>
antennas of the transmitting terminal. Fig. 11 shows n antennas to indicate that n information<br>
streams are received.<br>
Information (e.g., n information in Fig. 11) received via a plurality of antennas<br>
are decoded in correspondence to the channel coding technique performed by the transmitting<br>
terminal. A CRC checking unit then performs an error check using CRC which is included in<br>
each of the decoded information streams. As a result of performing this CRC checking, if an<br>
error exists, the CRC checking unit generates a NACK. If there is no error, the CRC<br>
checking unit generates an ACK. Accordingly, when n different information streams are<br>
received in parallel, n ACK/NACKs will be transmitted. In this case, the n received data<br>
streams may be assumed as data streams transmitted for one timeslot via n transmitting<br>
antennas. If desired, the information streams within a certain timeslot may be simultaneously<br>
processed.<br>
Fig. 11 shows n ACK/NACKs inputted to a combiner to be combined into one<br>
ACK/NACK signal. For example, n ACK/NACKs may be combined into one ACK/NACK.<br>
An AND operation is carried out to combine these signals into one ACK/NACK. In<br>
particular, consider n ACK/NACKs such as ACK/NACK1, ACK/NACK2, ..., ACK/NACKn.<br>
The combined ACK/NACK can be expressed according to the following:<br>
ACK/NACK (Combined) = ACK/NACK1 D ACK/NACK2 D... PI<br>
ACK/NACKn,<br>
where if data is successfully received, each of ACK/NACK1 to ACK/NACKn<br>
can have a value of 1. Otherwise, each of these ACK/NACKs can have a value of 0.<br>
If the combined ACK/NACK indicates 1, this could refer to the entire n data<br>
as being successfully received. If the combined ACK/NACK indicates 0, this could refer to<br>
at least one of the n data as not being successfully received. Consequently, a frequency<br>
resource for control information transmission can be efficiently allocated.<br>
Fig. 12 is a block diagram of an ACK/NACK transmitting apparatus according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a control unit is added<br>
to the configuration shown in Fig. 11, as well as a plurality of combiners.<br>
In Fig. 12, n ACK/NACKs respectively generated by CRC checking units are<br>
inputted to a control unit. The control unit then groups the inputted ACK/NACKs into a<br>
plurality of groups. These groups can be classified according to a type of received data<br>
stream. For instance, if a prescribed portion of data is important in checking a successful data<br>
reception and needs to be separately processed, it can be separately grouped. Alternatively,<br>
these ACK/NACKs can be divided into a prescribed number of groups to appropriately select<br>
the size of control information to be transmitted regardless of the type of the received data.<br>
As mentioned above, the grouped ACK/NACK signals are combined by a<br>
plurality of combiners to generate one ACK/NACK signal per group. In general,<br>
ACK/NACKs corresponding to a specific group may include a single ACK/NACK. In this<br>
aspect, a corresponding ACK/NACK is processed in the same manner as other ACK/NACKs<br>
having undergone the combining operation without passing through a separate operation for<br>
the ACK/NACK signal combining.<br>
Consider further that the number of groups selected by the above principle<br>
may be equal to or smaller than m, and thus m ACK/NACKs may be obtained. The m<br>
ACK/NACKs are inputted to a transmitting unit and then transmitted via an antenna.<br>
The embodiments of Figs. 11 and 12 have been described with regard to the<br>
error detection code implemented using CRC code. Alternatively, a random error detection<br>
code that is a signal requested by a receiving terminal may be used to be informed whether a<br>
data transmission is successful.<br>
Various embodiments enable a receiving terminal to transmit ACK/NACK at<br>
the SCW level despite using MCW having a data rate that is higher than that of the SCW.<br>
Alternatively, if transmission of the n data streams falls below a certain critical count, an<br>
. ACK/NACK indicating a presence or non-presence of a transmission success for each of the<br>
n data streams can be transmitted without being combined instead of repeating transmissions<br>
of the entire n data streams. Alternatively, consider the situation in which transmission of<br>
specific data fails a certain number of times on the assumption that a plurality of received<br>
data streams can be individually discriminated. ACK/NACK information for indicating a<br>
presence or non-presence of transmission success of the specific data stream is independently<br>
transmitted without combining and the remainder of ACK7NACK signals are combined and<br>
transmitted.<br>
It is understood that an ACK/NACK is an example of control information<br>
which indicates whether data transmitted by a transmitting terminal is successfully received<br>
by a receiving terminal. ACK/NACK is commonly used for HARQ. However, a random<br>
signal, for example, performing the above-noted functions may be used as a replacement for<br>
ACK/NACK.<br>
Subcarrier Mapping in Uplink<br>
Various additional embodiments relate to subcarrier mapping in the uplink. In<br>
particular, such embodiments include arranging transmission data in a frequency resource<br>
allocated to the uplink in a wireless communication system using a plurality of subcarriers<br>
and a transmitter implementing the same.<br>
Fig. 13 depicts localized allocation of a number of subcarriers. In this figure,<br>
localized allocation refers to user data that is transmitted via a prescribed number of<br>
subcarriers, distributed adjacent to a predetermined band, among the entire band of a<br>
frequency resource allocated for the uplink. User data is transmitted via subcarriers on a<br>
predetermined band only by inputting 0 to the remaining subcarriers.<br>
According to the localized allocation, only a partial band of an uplink<br>
frequency resource is used. Yet, if transmission data is transmitted by a resource unit<br>
including a predetermined number of subcarriers, the transmission data tends to be<br>
intensively arranged in a predetermined area within resource units consecutively allocated to<br>
a partial band of the frequency resource.<br>
Fig. 13B depicts distributed allocation of a number of subcarriers. In this<br>
figure, distributed allocation refers to user data transmitted via subcarriers equally distributed<br>
across entire bands of a frequency resource allocated for the uplink. By inputting 0 to the<br>
remaining subcarriers, the system can transmit the user data using only the distributively<br>
allocated specific subcarriers.<br>
The distributed allocation can distributively transmit the data across the entire<br>
bands of the uplink frequency resource to raise frequency diversity. So, it is advantageous<br>
that the distributed allocation is strong against channel influence. However, as a pilot interval<br>
in transmitting a pilot using a short block gets wider than that in transmitting a pilot using a<br>
long block, channel estimation performance may be degraded.<br>
By way of overview, various embodiments include a method of arranging<br>
subcarriers for retransmission data distributively within an allocated partial band and a<br>
transmitter supporting the same. Channel influence may be minimized using localized<br>
allocation.<br>
One aspect includes arranging subcarriers for transmission data distributively<br>
and a transmitter supporting the same. A predetermined number of the subcarriers are bound<br>
together to be distributively arranged according to localized allocation.<br>
Another embodiment relates to a method of arranging subcarriers in the uplink,<br>
in which the subcarriers for data transmission are arranged in a frequency resource allocated<br>
for the uplink. One operation includes arranging the subcarriers for data transmission in a<br>
local band of the frequency resource allocated for the uplink, such that the subcarriers are<br>
distributed with an equal space for a whole part of the local band.<br>
According to one feature, the transmission data is a control signal repeatedly<br>
coded with prescribed bits.<br>
In another feature, the transmission data is transmitted via N (N = 1, 2, 3, ...)<br>
resource units, each having a prescribed number of subcarriers, and wherein the subcarriers<br>
are arranged in a manner of arranging theN resource units in the local band of the frequency<br>
resource allocated for the uplink and distributing the subcarriers with the equal space across a<br>
whole band occupied by the N resource units.<br>
In another aspect, a method of arranging subcarriers in the uplink, in which the<br>
subcarriers for data transmission are arranged in a frequency resource allocated for the uplink,<br>
includes grouping the subcarriers for the data transmission by at least two of the subcarriers<br>
across a whole band of the frequency resource allocated for the uplink, wherein the grouped<br>
subcarriers are distributed with an equal space.<br>
Another feature relates to the transmission data transmitted via N (N = 1, 2, 3,<br>
...) resource units, each having a prescribed number of subcarriers, and wherein the<br>
subcarriers are arranged in a manner of distributing the N resource units in the whole band of<br>
the frequency resource allocated for the uplink with the equal space. The method further<br>
includes grouping the subcarriers by at least two of the subcarriers, and arranging the grouped<br>
subcarriers within each of theN resource units.<br>
In yet another aspect, an apparatus includes a subcarrier arranging module<br>
arranging the subcarriers for the data transmission in a local band of the frequency resource<br>
allocated for the uplink, wherein the subcarriers are distributed with an equal space for a<br>
whole part of the local band.<br>
In one feature, the transmission data is transmitted via N (N = 1, 2, 3, ...)<br>
resource units, each having a prescribed number of the subcarriers, and wherein the<br>
subcarriers are arranged in a manner of arranging the N resource units in the local band of the<br>
frequency resource allocated for the uplink and distributing the subcarriers with the equal<br>
space across a whole band occupied by the N resource units.<br>
In another aspect, a transmitting apparatus for arranging subcarriers in the<br>
uplink includes a subcarrier arranging module grouping the subcarriers for the data<br>
transmission by at least two of the subcarriers across a whole band of the frequency resource<br>
allocated for the uplink, wherein the grouped subcarriers are distributed with an equal space.<br>
Fig. 14 is a block diagram depicting a method for uplink transmission using<br>
OFDM. At block 210, a high data Tate data stream (or data symbol) is inputted in series and<br>
converted to a plurality of data streams having slow data rates via a serial to parallel<br>
converter. Each of the parallel-converted data streams is multiplied by a corresponding<br>
subcarrier through a subcarrier mapper (block 220), and then transformed into a time-domain<br>
signal by IDFT (block 230). Block 240 inserts a cyclic prefix in the time-domain signal for<br>
preventing channel interference. The signal is converted to a serial signal and then<br>
transmitted to a receiving terminal (block 250).<br>
It is understood that in a system performing modulation using a plurality of<br>
orthogonal subcarriers, OFDMA refers to the situation in which a multiple access method is<br>
accomplished by providing portions of available subcarriers to different users. OFDMA<br>
provides different users with frequency resources, such as subcarriers. Since the frequency<br>
resources are independently provided to a plurality of users, they are not overlapped, with<br>
each other.<br>
Since orthogonality is maintained between subcarriers, a high data rate can be<br>
obtained. A possible problem that may arise relates to the peak to average power ratio<br>
(PAPR). To minimize or effectively eliminate this problem, spreading is carried out in the<br>
frequency domain using a DFT matrix. This operation is typically performed before the<br>
generation of an OFDM signal. The result of the spreading is modulated by OFDM to obtain<br>
a single carrier transmission. This situation may be referred to as DFT-S-OFDMA.<br>
Fig. 15 is a flowchart depicting the generation of a transmission signal<br>
according to DFT-S-OFDMA. The technique is similar in many respects to that which is<br>
shown in Fig. 1, such that blocks 310 - 340 generally correspond to blocks 110-140 of Fig. 1.<br>
A distinction is that cyclic prefix insertion (block 350) is shown occurring prior to the<br>
parallel/serial conversion of block 360.<br>
In a multi-carrier system using OFDMA or DFT-S-OFDM, user equipment<br>
data, pilot, control information, and the like, are transmitted in the uplink. If the user<br>
equipment data is transmitted in the uplink, corresponding control information is transmitted<br>
in the downlink. Using the corresponding control information, a transmission band is<br>
allocated or a data transport format is decided.<br>
There are two general types of pilot signals. A CQ pilot is used to measure<br>
channel quality to perform UE scheduling and adaptive modulation and coding. A data pilot<br>
may also be used for channel estimation and data demodulation in data transmission. The<br>
data pilot is the pilot transmitted on a corresponding domain. Control information may<br>
include data-associated control information and non-data-associated control information, as<br>
described above. The above-noted UE data, pilot, and control information may be<br>
transmitted via a subframe having a predetermined structure. An example includes a FDD<br>
sub frame for the uplink proposed by 3 GPP LTE. A suitable subframe is depicted in Fig. 3 A.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 3 A, a cyclic prefix (CP) is shown inserted between the<br>
respective blocks to avoid inter-block interference. In this arrangement, the long block (LB)<br>
is usable for transmission of uplink data or control information, and the short block (SB) is<br>
usable for transmission of uplink data or a pilot<br>
One method for multiplexing the subframe first includes multiplexing the UE<br>
data, pilot, and data-associated-control information. Another method for multiplexing<br>
includes multiplexing the UE data, pilot, data demodulation associated control information,<br>
and data demodulation non-associated control information. A third method for multiplexing<br>
includes multiplexing the pilot and data demodulation non-associated control information.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 7, data demodulation associated control information and<br>
data demodulation non-associated control information for a specific user are shown<br>
multiplexed with UE data of a corresponding user, and simultaneously, data demodulation<br>
non-associated control information for other users is multiplexed together. This results in<br>
each resource block including the same kind of uplink data.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 8, data demodulation associated control information for<br>
a specific user and UE data are multiplexed, but data demodulation non-associated control<br>
information for multiple users including the specific user is transmitted via a separately<br>
provided predetermined time-frequency domain (area indicated by slashes in Fig. 8). Various<br>
kinds of data carried by the subframes, such as that which is shown in Figs. 7 and 8, may be<br>
multiplexed in the time domain to maintain the advantage of the DFT-S-OFDM having low<br>
PAPR.<br>
Since UE data for a specific user and data demodulation non-associated<br>
control information are multiplexed and transmitted for the same subframe, it is common for<br>
the same kind of frequency allocation to be applied to the UE data and the data demodulation<br>
non-associated control information. In particular, if localized allocation is applied to the UE<br>
data, it should be applied to the data demodulation non-associated control information as well.<br>
As previously described, the ACK/NACK may be represented by a relatively<br>
few number of bits. The UE, for example, may repeatedly transmit ACK/NACK for error<br>
rate enhancement. This may be accomplished using, for example, the various techniques<br>
previously described with regard to Figs. 3A and 3B.<br>
Note that the repeated ACK/NACK can be transmitted via a resource unit that<br>
is a bundle of a prescribed number of consecutive subcarriers. The resource unit generally<br>
includes 25 long block frequency intervals, which does not appear to be a significant<br>
limitation. Alternatively, the resource unit may include long block frequency intervals of<br>
other lengths (e.g., 15,12,10, and the like). The size of a normal resource unit can be<br>
represented as:<br>
RU = 25*15 KHz(LB) = 375 KHz.<br>
Hence, the localized allocation among the above-described frequency<br>
allocation techniques is characterized in that N resource units are consecutively allocated to a<br>
partial band. The distributed allocation among the described frequency allocation methods is<br>
characterized in that N resource units are discontinuously and equally allocated across entire<br>
bands.<br>
In localized allocation, a frequency resource allocated to subcarriers for<br>
ACK/NACK signal transmission is smaller than a frequency resource occupied by N resource<br>
units. As an example, Fig. 16 shows a distribution of subcarriers used for resource unit and_<br>
ACK/NACK transmission. In particular, N resource units are consecutively allocated to a<br>
partial band of an uplink frequency resource. The subcarriers used for repeated transmission<br>
of ACK/NACK signal among subcarriers included in the N resource units can be intensively<br>
arranged on a specific band (central band in Fig. 16) of the frequency resource occupied by<br>
the N resource units. This case is referred to as pure localized allocation.<br>
As noted above, localized allocation is vulnerable to channel influence since .<br>
data is transmitted on an adjacent channel. Pure localized allocation is more vulnerable to '<br>
channel influence since the subcarriers of the transmission object included in the N resource<br>
units are intensively located on a specific band, as well as the N resource units being adjacent<br>
to each other.<br>
To improve these vulnerabilities, enhanced localized allocation (distributed<br>
within allocated frequency resources) may be utilized. Fig. 17 provides an example of a<br>
subcarrier arrangement using enhanced localized allocation. This technique applies<br>
distributed allocation to the subcarriers of the transmission object included in the N resource<br>
units, while applying localized allocation to the N resource units. In particular, subcarriers<br>
actually used for transmission of ACK/NACK signal are equally spaced and discontinuously<br>
arranged across the entire frequency resource.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a distribution of subcarriers used for ACK/NACK signal<br>
transmission. The distributed allocation may be used to achieve frequency diversity. When a<br>
pilot is carried by a short block, a pilot interval becomes wider than when a long block is<br>
used. Such an arrangement may not be preferable since channel estimation performance may<br>
be degraded. An enhanced distributed allocation capable of enhancing channel estimation<br>
performance may be achieved by grouping subcarriers for ACK/NACK signal transmission<br>
into a plurality of groups, each of which includes at least two subcarriers. These groups are<br>
then arranged instead of arranging the individual subcarriers.<br>
Figs. 19A and 19B depict a subcarrier arrangement using enhanced distributed<br>
allocation, in which a pair of subcarriers is configured as a group. In Fig. 19 A, since each<br>
subcarrier carries an ACK/NACK signal using a long block, a frequency interval (e.g., 15<br>
KHz) amounting to the long block exists between a pair of the subcarriers configuring the<br>
corresponding group.<br>
In order to transmit an ACK/NACK signal to a receiving terminal, pilot<br>
information for matching synchronization between transmitting and receiving terminals<br>
should be transmitted to the receiving terminal. Since it is unnecessary to transmit the pilot<br>
information for each subcarrier, the present embodiment implements one pilot that is<br>
transmitted for a pair of the grouped subcarriers. The pilot information is carried by a short<br>
block. Since a frequency band (e.g., 30 KHz) of a short block is generally twice as wide as<br>
that of a long block, it coincides with the technique that otfe pilot is transmitted for each pair<br>
of the subcarriers for ACK/NACK signal transmission.<br>
Fig. 19B shows frequency resource allocation of subcarriers for the pilot<br>
information transmission. Consider a grouping of subcarriers for ACK/NACK signal<br>
transmission by a three-subcarrier unit, a frequency band (15 KHz * 3 = 45 KHz) occupied<br>
by one group is not equal to a frequency band (30 KHz) occupied by the subcarriers for pilot<br>
transmission. Because of this, a gap of 30 KHz between the groups may be necessary (Fig.<br>
20A). Since the subcarriers for pilot information transmission, as shown in Fig. 20B, should<br>
be arranged for each 60 KHz, channel estimation performance using a pilot is degraded rather<br>
than the case of configuring a group with a pair of subcarriers.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the enhanced localized allocation<br>
or the enhanced distributed allocation is typically carried out by a suitable subcarrier mapper<br>
(e.g., block 220 of Fig. 14) of the OFDM transmitting terminal or the subcarrier mapper of<br>
the OFDMA transmitting terminal (e.g., block 330 of Fig. 15). Alternatively, the enhanced<br>
localized allocation or the enhanced distributed allocation can be carried out by a subcarrier<br>
arranging module responsible for each frequency resource allocation.<br>
A benefit of localized allocation permits efficient use of frequency resources<br>
and arranges subcarriers for transmission data within the locally allocated resource units.<br>
Hence, such an arrangement is protected against channel influence in a manner that is greater<br>
than existing systems. Another benefit relates to the distributed allocation to avoid channel<br>
influence. This embodiment binds a predetermined number of subcarriers for transmission,<br>
and arranges the subcarriers distributively. Hence, compared to conventional systems,<br>
degradation of channel estimation is reduced.<br>
