METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL OPERATION OF A HYDRAULIC<br>
CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions, and more specifically to control of a hydraulic<br>
circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel/electric hybrid powertrain architectures comprise torque-<br>
generative devices, including internal combustion engines and electric<br>
machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to a vehicle<br>
driveline. One such transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from an internal combustion engine, and an output member for<br>
delivering motive torque from the transmission to the vehicle driveline.<br>
Exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively operative in fixed<br>
gear modes and continuously variable modes through actuation of torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational speed of the<br>
transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of the input<br>
member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when rotational speed<br>
of the transmission output member is variable based upon operating speeds of<br>
one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines can be connected to<br>
the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct connection. Clutch<br>
actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a hydraulic circuit,<br>
including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management valves, pressure<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled by a control<br>
module.<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions with hydraulically-actuated clutches are tasked with<br>
implementing transmission control schemes to manage operating temperatures<br>
of the electrical machines. Such a system is described hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove and in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the invention, a method and an apparatus comprising a<br>
control system for an electro-mechanical transmission selectively operative in<br>
a plurality of fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes is provided.<br>
The exemplary electro-mechanical transmission comprises first and second<br>
electrical machines and a hydraulic circuit comprising a plurality of pressure<br>
control devices and flow management valves. The method comprises<br>
monitoring an operating temperature of the electrical machines. A cooling<br>
flow rate in the hydraulic circuit effective to reduce the operating temperature<br>
of the electrical machines is determined. Availability of active cooling for<br>
each of the electrical machines is determined. Hydraulic flow in the hydraulic<br>
circuit is selectively controlled.<br>
[0005] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1, 2, and 3 depict a system comprising an engine 14,<br>
transmission 10, control system, and hydraulic control circuit 42 which has<br>
been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0012] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an internal combustion engine 14. The<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. and four<br>
torque-transmitting devices, i.e. clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75.<br>
The electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by transmission<br>
control module 17, is operative to control actuation and deactivation of the<br>
clutches via hydraulic fluid lines 132, 134, 136, and 138. Clutches C2 and C4<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br>
C1 and C3 preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary<br>
devices grounded to the transmission case 68.<br>
[0013] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
[0014] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44 .<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64. An inner gear member of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to<br>
an inner gear member of the third planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft<br>
66 that circumscribes shaft 60, and is connected to a second electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 72. referred to as MG-B.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
[0015] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which permits<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72. Transmission output member 64 is operably connected<br>
to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive torque. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump,<br>
described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based<br>
upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related<br>
to typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described<br>
hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy<br>
to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31.<br>
Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for<br>
providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0017] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective<br>
electrical machine, i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and<br>
31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from<br>
the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and transmits<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br>
energy storage device 74. The inverters comprise known complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics devices. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72<br>
are three-phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a<br>
stator that is mounted on a case of the transmission. Each machine stator<br>
includes a temperature sensor (not depicted) signally connected to the TPIM,<br>
and operative to monitor stator temperature.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising distributed control module architecture, is depicted. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
overarching control and coordination of the aforementioned control modules.<br>
There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices<br>
through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the<br>
powertrain including the transmission 10 through an operator torque request.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The<br>
LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters and<br>
commands between the various control modules. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate<br>
protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing<br>
between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules<br>
providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle<br>
stability.<br>
[0019] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request, an engine torque command,<br>
clutch torque commands for the various clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B. The<br>
TCM is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42<br>
detailed in Fig. 3, including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not<br>
depicted) and generating and executing control signals for various pressure<br>
control solenoids and control valves contained therein.<br>
[0020] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
depicted as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is depicted generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, N1, to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0021] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches C l, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches and<br>
selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to actuate<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0022] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0023] The TPIM 19 includes previously referenced power inverters and<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque commands for<br>
MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, based upon input from the HCP 5, which is driven<br>
by operator input through UI 13 and system operating parameters. The<br>
motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B are implemented by the<br>
control system, including the TPIM 19, to control MG-A and MG-B.<br>
Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and MG-B are derived by the<br>
TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or conventional rotation sensors.<br>
The TPIM 19 determines and communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5.<br>
The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the<br>
TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is transferable to or from the<br>
TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged. The TPIM is operative to monitor signal inputs from the<br>
temperature sensors operative to monitor each of the stators of the electrical<br>
machines.<br>
[0024] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0025] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0026] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request at shaft 64. Selectively<br>
operated components of the transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and<br>
manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For example, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment depicted in Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has<br>
selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or<br>
the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque which affects how and<br>
when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle acceleration is<br>
affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle<br>
mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-generative<br>
devices, and determines the output of the transmission required to achieve the<br>
operator torque request. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10<br>
operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the<br>
operator demand.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
[0027] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and Table 1,<br>
below.<br><br>
[0028] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each operating mode. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch C1 70 is actuated in order to<br>
"ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. A second<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch C1 70 is released and clutch C2 62<br>
is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect<br>
when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are<br>
not discussed herein.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0029] The control system, depicted primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to<br>
provide a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow<br>
to relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two<br>
modes with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the<br>
transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway<br>
speeds, and meet various other requirements as previously described.<br>
Additionally, the control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10<br>
so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0030] The first and second continuously variable modes of operation refer<br>
to circumstances in which the transmission functions are controlled by one<br>
clutch, i.e. either clutch C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and<br>
torque of the electrical machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a<br>
continuously variable transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are<br>
described below in which fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional<br>
clutch. This additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as depicted in the<br>
table, above.<br>
[0031] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e. N1/No, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B, through planetary<br>

[0032] Referring to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram is depicted which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. The main<br>
hydraulic pump 88, driven off the input shaft from the engine 10, and auxiliary<br>
pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19, provide<br>
pressurized fluid to the hydraulic circuit 42 through valve 140. The auxiliary<br>
pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, which is<br>
operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices,<br>
including the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active<br>
cooling circuits for machines A and B, and a base cooling circuit for cooling<br>
and lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142, 144 (not depicted in<br>
detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes through<br>
selective actuation of hydraulic circuit flow control devices comprising<br>
variable pressure control solenoids ('PCS') PCS1 108, PCS2 112, PCS3 114,<br>
PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-valve 118 and<br>
Y-valve 120. The circuit is fluidly connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2,<br>
PS3, and PS4 via passages 124, 122, 126, and 128, respectively. The pressure<br>
control solenoid PCS1 108 has a control position of normally high and is<br>
operative to modulate magnitude of fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit<br>
through fluidic interaction with controllable pressure regulator 109.<br>
Controllable pressure regulator 109, not shown in detail, interacts with PCS1<br>
108 to control hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic circuit 42 over a range of<br>
pressures, depending upon operating conditions as described hereinafter.<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low,<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control<br>
position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and<br>
operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is<br>
fluidly connected to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0033] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High ('1') and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve to which control flow to different devices in<br>
the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is operative<br>
to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling systems for<br>
stators of MG-A and MG-B via fluidic passages 136, 138, 144, 142<br>
respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described<br>
hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid to<br>
clutches C1 and C2 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively, depending<br>
upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter. The Y-valve<br>
121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122. A more<br>
detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>
provided in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/263216,<br>
Attorney Docket No. GP 306089, entitled "A Multiplexed Pressure Switch<br>
System for an Electrically Variable Hybrid Transmission", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>

[0034] The hydraulic circuit includes a base cooling circuit for providing<br>
hydraulic fluid to cool the stators for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The base<br>
cooling circuit includes fluid conduits from the valve 140 flowing directly to a<br>
flow restrictor 146 which leads to fluidic passage 144 leading to the base<br>
cooling circuit for the stator of MG-A 56. and to flow restrictor 148 which<br>
leads to fluidic passage 142 leading to the base cooling circuit for the stator of<br>
MG-B 72. Active cooling of stators for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 is effected by<br>
selective actuation of pressure control solenoids PCS2 112, PCS3 114 and<br>
PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-valve 118 and<br>
Y-valve 120, which leads to flow of hydraulic fluid around the selected stator<br>
and permits heat to be transferred therebetween, primarily through conduction.<br><br>

[0035] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2,<br>
below.<br><br>
[0036] Selective control of the X and Y valves and actuation of the solenoids<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches<br>
C1, C2, C3, and C4, and provide cooling for the stators of MG-A and MG-B.<br>
[0037] In operation, an operating mode, i.e. one of the fixed gear and<br>
continuously variable mode operations, is determined for the exemplary<br>
transmission based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the<br>
powertrain. This includes demand for an operator demand for torque,<br>
typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external conditions,<br>
including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load. The<br>
operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
control module command to operate of the electrical machines in an electrical<br>
energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating mode<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine operable to<br>
determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power,<br>
battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine<br>
14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to optimize system<br>
efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component<br>
or system.<br>
[0038] Referring now to the transmission described with reference to Figs. 1,<br>
2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of the transmission and control<br>
system are described herein. The control system is operative to selectively<br>
actuate the pressure control devices and the flow management valves based<br>
upon a demand for torque, presence of a fault, and temperatures of the electric<br>
motors. The control system selectively commands one of the low-range<br>
continuously variable operation, the high-range continuously variable<br>
operation, the low range state, and the high range state based upon selective<br>
actuation of the X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120 flow management valves. The<br>
control system effects actuation of the stator cooling system the first electrical<br>
machine (MG-A Stator Cool), the stator cooling system for the second<br>
electrical machine (MG-B Stator Cool), and the first hydraulically-actuated<br>
clutch (C1) based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 when the low-range continuously variable operation<br>
has been commanded. Furthermore, the control system is operative to effect<br>
actuation of the stator cooling system for MG-A, stator cooling system for<br>
MG-B, and the second hydraulically-actuated clutch C2 based upon selective<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
actuation of the pressure control devices when the high-range continuously<br>
variable operation has been commanded. The control system is operative to<br>
effect actuation of the first, second, and fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches<br>
(i.e., C1, C2, C4) based upon selective actuation of the pressure control<br>
devices when the low-range state has been commanded, comprising operation<br>
in one of the first, second, and third fixed gear ratios via selective actuation of<br>
the clutches. The control system is operative to effect actuation of the second,<br>
third, and fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches (i.e., C2, C3, C4) based upon<br>
selective actuation of the pressure control devices when the high-range state<br>
has been commanded, comprising operation in one of the third and fourth<br>
fixed gear ratios via selective actuation of the clutches.<br>
[0039] As previously stated, fluid output from each of the second, third and<br>
fourth pressure control devices (i.e., PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4) is selectively<br>
mapped to one of the four hydraulically-actuated clutches and stator cooling<br>
systems for MG-A and MG-B based upon commanded positions of the first<br>
and second flow management valves. Therefore, selective actuation of PCS2<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B, when<br>
both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation<br>
of PCS2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C2 when either of the<br>
X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High. Selective actuation of<br>
PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch Cl when both the X-<br>
valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS3<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B when<br>
the X-valve is commanded to Low and the Y-valve is commanded to High.<br>
Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch<br>
C1 when the X-valve is commanded to High and the Y-valve is commanded to<br>
Low. Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate<br>
clutch C3 when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
Selective actuation of PCS4 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling<br>
to the stator of MG-A when the X-valve is commanded to Low, regardless of<br>
the position to which the Y-valve is commanded. Selective actuation of PCS4<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C4 when the X-valve is<br>
commanded to High, regardless of the position to which the Y-valve is<br>
commanded.<br>
[0040] Referring now to the flowchart depicted in Fig. 4, with reference to<br>
the exemplary transmission described with reference to Figs. 1, 2, and 3, and<br>
Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of controlling operation of the exemplary<br>
transmission and control system are described, comprising a control scheme<br>
for selectively controlling the pressure control devices, i.e., PCS2, PCS3, and<br>
PCS4, and flow management valves X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120 to provide<br>
flow of hydraulic fluid to effect cooling of the stators of MG-A and MG-B.<br>
[0041] Operating temperatures of the stators are ongoingly monitored by the<br>
control system using signal inputs from the stator temperature sensors (Block<br>
210). When temperature measured by the sensors at either of the stators of<br>
MG-A or MG-B exceeds a predetermined threshold, the control system seeks<br>
to increase motor cooling by increasing flow of hydraulic fluid to and over the<br>
stator (Block 212). The predetermined threshold temperature is calibrated in<br>
the range of 200C for this embodiment, and preferably comprises a<br>
temperature which is determined based upon material properties of<br>
components of the stator and rotor and other surrounding components to<br>
prevent creation of component faults.<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
20<br>
[0042] To increase motor cooling by increasing flow of hydraulic fluid to the<br>
stator (Block 212), a total hydraulic fluid flow rate required for effectively<br>
cooling the stator is determined (Block 214). Increasing flow of hydraulic<br>
fluid comprises increasing flow through one of the base cooling circuits, and<br>
causing flow through one of the active cooling circuits when conditions so<br>
permit.<br>
[0043] The total hydraulic flow rate required includes sufficient flow to<br>
achieve the required clutch capacity to transmit motive torque through the<br>
transmission, and stator cooling flow. Stator cooling flow includes flow<br>
through the base cooling circuit, and when enabled, flow through the active<br>
cooling circuit. The intent is to provide a hydraulic flow rate sufficient to<br>
effectively reduce the stator temperature below the threshold temperature<br>
through heat transfer from the stator to the hydraulic fluid, which can be<br>
subsequently cooled through known hydraulic transmission fluid cooling<br>
devices.<br>
[0044] It is next determined whether the flow management valves 118, 120<br>
are in positions which permit active motor cooling through the active cooling<br>
circuits (Block 216). Flow management valve positions which permit active<br>
motor cooling include any one of Mode I, Mode II, and Neutral, as depicted<br>
with reference to Table 2. When active motor cooling is permitted, a<br>
minimum value for main pressure is determined to achieve total required flow<br>
with active cooling initiated, including maintaining pressure for clutch<br>
actuation (Block 218). Active cooling preferably includes operating the<br>
selected pressure control solenoid, 'PCSn', i.e. PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4, to a<br>
full-on position to effect maximized flow of hydraulic fluid to the stator for<br>
cooling (Block 220). Active cooling further includes determining total<br>
hydraulic flow needs of the hydraulic system, taking into account hydraulic<br>
flow through the actuated pressure control solenoid that is fully open,<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
21<br>
hydraulic flow necessary to achieve pressure for the required clutch torque<br>
capacity to transmit motive torque, and any other flow needs typically<br>
necessary for operation of the transmission (Block 226). The control system<br>
modulates flow through valve 107 using PCS1 108 to achieve sufficient flow<br>
of hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic circuit at the required pressure, which is<br>
controlled using regulator 109 (Block 228).<br>
[0045] When active motor cooling is not permitted and the stator<br>
temperature has exceeded the threshold, there remains a need to cool the<br>
stator, using flow through the base cooling circuit. A base cooling flow rate is<br>
determined (Block 222). A minimum value for main pressure is determined to<br>
achieve total required flow through the base cooling circuit to the stator for<br>
effective cooling (Block 224). A total hydraulic flow rate necessary to<br>
achieve base cooling, to achieve pressure for the required clutch torque<br>
capacity to transmit motive torque, and any other flow needs typically<br>
necessary for operation of the transmission is determined (again, Block 226).<br>
The control system modulates flow through valve 107 using PCS1 108 to<br>
achieve sufficient flow of hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic circuit at the<br>
required pressure (again, Block 228).<br>
[0046] When temperatures at the stators do not exceed the predetermined<br>
threshold, the stators are cooled using the base cooling circuit (Block 212). A<br>
base cooling flow rate is determined, based upon the stator temperature (Block<br>
222), and a minimum main pressure is determined to achieve the base cooling<br>
flow (Block 224). Total flow needs of the hydraulic system are determined,<br>
taking into account the hydraulic flow necessary to achieve pressure for the<br>
required clutch capacity to transmit motive torque and any other flow needs<br>
typically necessary for operation of the transmission (Block 226). The control<br>
modulates flow through valve 107 using PCS1 108 and the regulator 109 to<br><br>
GP-308401-PTH-CD<br>
22<br>
achieve necessary flow of hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic circuit and<br>
achieve the required pressure (Block 228).<br>
