				<td>The present invention relates to a linkage      device  especially for adjustment of rear view mirrors for motor vehicles.<br>
The invention concerns a linkage arrangement especially for the adjustment of rearview mirrors for motor vehicles is accord with me generic concept of Claim 1 aad the invention former concerns rearview minors in accord with the generic concept of Claim 18.<br>
EPOS 90 510 Bl or EP 06 54 377 A2 makes known an adjustable rearview mirror, in which the mirror pane is connected by means of a linkage with a carrier plate. The linkage connection includes a ball socket, with is connected to said carrier plate. Into the ball socket is fitted a hemispherical, shell shaped projection, on which the mirror pane is fastened. By means of a clamping connection, the hemispherical shaped projection is pressed into the ball socket, so mat when pivoted, the linkage remains stationary in an optional direction. This ability to pivot in a desired direction, also results in relatively large play. Because of mis large play, the precision of the mirror adjustment is limited.<br>
DE 196 44 834 CI discloses, mat between the ball socket and the projection, there is provided a plastic disk with a first web on the outside and a second web perpendicular to the first on the inside. The two webs engage themselves in complementary shaped openings in the ball socket and in the projection pertaining thereto. By this structure of the ball socket, the plastic disk, and the projection, the guidance of the mirror adjustment is limited to two axes of rotation, disposed at right angles to one another. In any case, this construction has a tendency toward great play when exposed to abrasion and wear.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a linkage device especially for adjustment of rear view mirrors for motor vehicles comprising:<br>
•	a first linkage component which possesses a ball socket,<br>
•	a second linkage component which has a projection of an essentially spherical sectional shape<br>
which fits into the said ball socket,<br>
•	a sliding piece, and<br>
•	a connection assembly for the establishing of a clamping connection holding together the first linkage component, the sliding piece and the second linkage component,<br>
wherein the sides of the ball socket, the sliding piece and the projection, which face one another, and which have respectively, convex profiling, and complementary profiling thereto, wherein by means of the said profiling, a first and second axis of rotation (DAI, DA2) are fixed between the sliding piece, the ball socket and the projection therein characterized in that mutually facing complementary profilings encompass, when seen in top view, a plurality of parallel and straight line ridges and valleys and in that the mutually complementary profilings are in full surface contact with one another.<br>
In the following, with the aid of the description of examples of embodiments, the invention is more closely described with the resource of the drawing.<br><br>
Contrary to the above, it is the purpose of the invention, to make available a linkage arrangement, in which the play, during adjustments, remains small for extended periods. It is a further purpose of the present invention to provide a rearview mirror with such a linkage connection.<br>
These purposes are achieved by means of the features of Claims 1, 3 or 19. Because of the fact, that an outer, concave shape is more sharply curved than an inner, convex shape, the surfaces of the cupped shapes, when the inner is placed within the outer, do not lie completely contiguous to one another and especially at what should be the deepest point of contact between the two, the surfaces do not touch at all. Because of this, the inner convex structure can penetrate, as unavoidable wear progresses, deeper into the outer concave structure, to the advantage that wear does not bring about increased play. The said convex and concave structures form, respectively, a ball-and-socket joint.<br>
Surface profiling is provided on the ball-and-socket assembly and the sliding part connected therewith. The profiling, when seen in top view, comprises straight line, corrugations following the surfaces. By this surface profiling of the ball-and-socket and associated parts, two axes of rotation are defined, fixed in space, and oriented at an angle to one another thus, establishing planes of rotation. By this means, the desired adjustment, or pivoting capability is established. Simultaneously, loadings by forces not in the current planes of rotation, are distributed over the plurality of the elevations of said profiling and are thus less effective. Additionally, by means of this corrugationlike profiling, the guidance into the current plane of rotation is improved and play further diminished. (See Claim 2).<br>
hi accord with an alternative embodiment of the inventions, as set forth in Claim 3, where a multiplicity of grooves and elevations are present as part of the profiling, the improved freedom from play occurs without a difference in radii of curvature by means of the full surface contact of the said grooves and elevations.<br>
hi accord with an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the two fixed axes of rotation stand perpendicular to one another, whereby the necessary paths of adjustment are minimized. (See Claim 4).<br>
In accord with yet another advantageous embodiment, a sliding piece is hemispherical in shape and thus its concavity fits with the shape of the ball projection. That is to say, the sliding piece is complementary to the said projection.<br>
Thereby, the transmission of force between the two linkage components is evenly distributed. (See Claim S).<br>
In accord with another advantageous embodiment, the profiling covers the full surface of the inner side of the ball socket and also covers that side of the projection as well as the forward and rear sides of the sliding piece. In this way, the surface, which has been profiled in accord with the invention, is maximized and the distribution of the forces made uniform. (See Claim 6.)<br>
Because of the wave form shaping of the profiling, the distribution of the forces is likewise evened out and peaks of force are avoided. (See Claim 7.)<br>
Because of the fact that the sliding piece is made of a vibration damping material, the vibration tendency of a rearview mirror is reduced with an invented linkage connection. (See Claim 8).<br>
The advantageous embodiment of the invention with a projection rod which penetrates central openings in the ball joint, sliding piece and projection, brings about a compact connection arrangement between the two linkage components. (See Claim 9).<br>
The sliding piece, in an advantageous manner, can be placed between the projection and the ball socket (Claims 10 and 11), on the convex underside of the ball joint (Claims 12 and 13) or on the concave topside of the projection (Claims 14 and 15). In this way, the size of the central openings, in a simple way, determines the pivoting range of the linkage apparatus.<br>
A linkage apparatus of this kind is especially appropriate for adjustable rearview mirrors. In this case, the adjustable mirror pane is connected with the mirror carrier by means of the invented linkage apparatus.<br>
The remaining subordinate Claims relate to further advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a linkage arrangement especially for adjustment of rear view mirrors for motor vehicles comprising:<br>
•	a first linkage component which possesses a ball socket,<br>
•	a second linkage component which has a projection of an essentially spherical sectional shape which fits into the said ball socket,<br>
•	a sliding piece, and<br>
•	a connection assembly for the establishing of a clamping connection holding together the first linkage component, the sliding piece and the second linkage component,<br>
wherein the sides of the ball socket, the sliding piece and the projection, which face one another, and which have respectively, convex profiling, and complementary profiling thereto,<br>
wherein by means of the said profiling, a first and second axis of rotation (DAI, DA2) are fixed between the sliding piece, the ball socket and the projection therein characterized in that mutually facing complementary profilings encompass, when seen in top view, a plurality of parallel and straight line ridges and valleys and in that the mutually complementary profilings are in full surface contact with one another.<br>
In the following, with the aid of the description of examples of embodiments, the invention is more closely described with the resource of the drawing.<br>
There is shown in:<br>
Fig. 1: a perspective exploded presentation of the essential elements of a first embodiment of the invention, seen at an angle from above,<br>
Fig. 2  a perspective exploded presentation of the essential<br>
elements of the first embodiment of the invention seen at an angle from below,<br>
Fig. 3   a sectional view of the embodiment example in accord with Figs. 1 and 2,<br>
Fig. 4 a schematic drawing of the differences in varied curvatures of convex and concave structuring,<br>
Fig. 5  a second embodiment of the invention, and Fig. 6  a third embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show a first embodiment of the invented linkage apparatus in an exploded view. The linkage apparatus encompasses a first linkage component 2 with a ball socket 4 and a second linkage component 6 with a hemispherically shaped projection 8. The ball socket 4 is likewise of hemispherical shape with a concave topside 10 and a convex underside 12. The said hemispherically shaped projection 8 and has a convex underside and a concave topside 16. The projection 8 fits into the ball socket 4. Between the ball socket 4 and the projection 8 is provided a hemispherical, shell shaped sliding piece 18 that has a convex underside 20 and a concave topside 22.<br>
The convex underside 20 of the sliding piece 18 is provided with a convex profiling 24 and the concave topside 18 of the ball socket 4 is also provided with a concave profiling 26. The convex and the concave profiling 24 and 26 are molded to be complementary to one another and partially fit together after insertion in a form-fit manner. In this way, between the first linkage part 2 and the sliding piece 18, a sliding movement is only possible about a first axis of rotation DAI. In the Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the first axis DAI extends itself horizontally across the plane of the drawing.<br>
The mutually concave topside 22 of the sliding piece 18 is likewise provided with the concave profiling 26 and the convex underside 14 of the projection 8 is furnished with convex profiling 24, complementary to the profiling 26. In this way, between the sliding piece 18 and the second linkage component, only one sliding direction of movement is possible about an axis of rotation DA2, which axis is perpendicular to the first axis of rotation DAI, and is also perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.<br>
The mutually complementary pro filings 24 and 26, consist of a plurality of elevations 28 and grooves 30, which appear in a top view to be straight lines. Viewed in a plane transverse to an axis of rotation DAI or DA2, the wave-like, cross-sections of the said elevations 28 and grooves 30 are visible, as this is to be seen in Fig. 3 in regard to the convex profiling 24 on the convex underside 20 of the sliding part 18 and the concave profiling 26 on the concave topside 10 of the ball socket 4.<br>
Ball socket 4, projection 8 and sliding part 18, or the respective convex and concave profiling on these said components, are made in a half shell form. In this case, the outer concave form 26 has a sharper curve than the inner convex form 24. That is to say, the concave radius Ri of the inner, convex form 24 is larger than the radius of curvature Ra of the outer, concave form 26 (see Fig. 4). If the forms 24 and 26 were rigid, then the complementary groove/elevation corrugations engage each other only along one circumferential line. Since, however, the forms 24 and 26 are plastically deformable, the engagement is along a closed contact strip surface. With this plastic arrangement, then the inner, convex form 24, of great curvature, and the outer concave form 26, of less curvature, upon abrasive wear, slide further into one another. Thus, upon long service, freedom from play is provided.<br>
Alternatively, the forms 24 and 26, which are complementary to one another, can be made to fit one another in such a way that the full surfaces are engaged, as this is indicated in the drawings of Figs. 1,2 and 4 to 6.<br>
By means of a connection apparatus 32, the first and second linkage components 2 and 6, along with the sliding piece 18 are clamped together.<br>
The connection apparatus 32 is comprised of a connecting rod 34, which penetrates a first, second and third central opening, respectively 36, 38 and 40, in the ball socket, the sliding piece 18 and the projection 8. The connecting rod 34 possess at its lower end a support assembly 42 and on its upper end likewise an abutment head 44. The upper abutment head 44, however, is a bolt head 44 and bears upon the concave topside 16 of the projection 8. The lower support assembly 42 encompasses a helical spring 46, a pressure disk 48 and a threaded nut 50. The pressure disk 48 and the helical spring 46 are slipped over the connection rod 34 which extends out of the first central opening 36 in the ball socket 4 and is fixed in place by the screwed head 50.<br>
The third central opening 40 in the projection 8 adapts in its diameter to the diameter of the connecting rod 34. The second central opening 38 in the sliding piece 18 is a slot, the greater diameter of which extends in the direction of rotation about the second axis of rotation DA2. The first central opening 36 in the ball socket 4 is also a slot, the greater diameter of which extends itself in the direction of rotation about the first axis of rotation, namely DAI.<br>
Fig. 5 shows, schematically, in a presentation similar to Fig. 3, a second preferred embodiment. This second embodiment of the invention differentiates itself from the first embodiment, in that the ball socket 4 is placed between the projection 8 and the sliding piece 18.<br>
The second linkage component 6 with projection 8, concave topside 16, convex underside 14 and convex profiling on said underside 14 corresponds to the second linkage component 6 of the first embodiment in accord with the Figs. 1 to 3. The concave profiling 26, is complementary to the convex profiling 24 on the convex underside 14. This differs from the first embodiment in that the said profiling 26 is now placed on the concave topside of the ball socket 4. In this way, the second axis of rotation DA2 between the projection 8 and the ball socket 4 is here fixed by the complementary profilings 24 and 26.<br>
On the convex underside 12 of the ball socket 4, likewise, the convex profiling is placed. The concave profiling 26 complementary to this is on the concave topside 22 of the sliding piece 18.<br>
In this way, the first axis of rotation DAI is determined by the complementary profiling 24 and 26 respectively on the convex underside 12 of the ball socket and on the concave topside 22 of the sliding piece 18.<br>
The connection apparatus 32 corresponds to that of the first embodiment. In this first embodiment case, the sliding piece 18 is under pressure by the pressure disk 48 lying against the underside 12 of the ball socket 4.<br>
The third central opening 40 in the projection 8 and the second central opening 38 in the sliding piece 18 correspond in diameter to the diameter of the connecting rod 34. The first central opening in the ball socket is likewise round, however essentially larger and defines the pivoting range between the two linkage components 2 and 6.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a third embodiment of the invention, which differentiates itself from the first and the second embodiments, in that the projection 8 is placed between the sliding piece 18 and the ball socket 4. The connection apparatus, for the sake of simplicity, is not shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The first axis of rotation DAI is determined between sliding piece 18 and projection 8 by the convex profiling 24 on the convex underside 20 of the sliding piece 18 and also the hereto complementary concave profiling 26 on the concave topside 16 of the projection 8. The second axis of rotation DA2 is determined at a line between the projection 8 and the ball socket 4 and by means of the convex profiling 24 on the convex underside 14 of the projection 8 and the hereto complementary profiling 26 on the concave topside 10 of that of the ball socket 4.<br>
The third central opening 40 in the projection 8 corresponds in its diameter to the diameter of the connecting rod (not shown). The first central opening 36 in the ball socket 4 and the second central opening 38 in the sliding piece 18 are essentially made larger in diameter and, once again, limit the pivoting range between the two linkage components 2 and 6.<br>
