				<td>CHIMERIC POLYPEPTIDES AND THE THERAPEUTIC USE THEREOF AGAINST A<br>
FLAVIVIRIDAE INFECTION Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the construction of a chimeric polypeptide for use in the prevention or treatment of a Flaviviridae infection. The present invention also relates to the use of the chimeric polypeptide in the production of recombinant viral vectors, such as a live measles viral vector to act as a vaccine. Brief description of the prior art<br>
Flaviviruses (the Flaviviridae family) are envelope viruses the genome of which is a RNA molecule with a positive polarity. The flavivirion is composed of three structural proteins designated C (core protein), M (membrane protein) and E (envelope protein). The E protein, which is exposed on the virus surface, is responsible for the principal biological functions of the virion, including attachment of the virus and specific membrane fusion. Translation of genomic RNA produces a precursor polyprotein which is simultaneously cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to generate individual viral proteins: three structural proteins C, prM (the glycosylated precursor of the M protein), E, and seven non-structural proteins NS1 to NS5. Replication of flaviviruses occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Flaviviruses have complex natural transmission cycles which involve several natural hosts (mainly mammals and birds) and vectors, the latter being hematophage arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes. These viruses are the principal cause of severe human diseases such as hemorrhagic manifestations or meningo-encephalitic syndromes. The dengue virus (DEN) is one of the two major flaviviruses known to be the cause of severe hemorrhagic diseases across the world.<br>
Dengue is an emerging disease and a bane to public health. Development of live-attenuated vaccine candidates against the four serotypes of the dengue virus has been carried out for more than 50 years. The search for a vaccine is hindered by the absence of an animal model which mimics the disease caused by the dengue virus, namely the hemorrhagic fever of dengue<br><br>
 and the shock syndrome associated therewith.   Vaccine effectiveness can be evaluated in the<br>
mouse using a neurovirulent strain of DEN virus adapted to the mouse, which kills adult animals after intracerebral inoculation. However, studies based on that type of murine model do not reflect the activity of the dengue virus in man. In the monkey, protection can only be demonstrated by measuring the reduction in viremia after an experimental infectious challenge. Thus, the ultimate test for a vaccine against dengue must be based on clinical trials carried out in man. The majority of attenuated vaccine candidates which have been developed over the last 50 years have been either too reactogenic or insufficiently immunogenic in clinical trials. Several attenuated tetravalent candidates are currently in phase I or II clinical trials. The difficulty in the development of this type of live-attenuated tetravalent vaccines appears to be in obtaining a balanced mixture of four valencies in order to generate protective immunity against the four serotypes.<br>
Various live chimeric vaccine candidates are also being developed. They are based on the exchange of homologous structural genes between different flaviviruses. Several types of intertype chimeric viruses have been constructed and tested in the mouse or monkey. Chimeric viruses have been constructed with Chimerivax® techniques based on the yellow fever vaccinal virus (YF-17D). Tetravalent mixtures of those YF-17D/DEN chimeras have been tested in the rhesus monkey. Here again, the balance between the four chimeric viruses is difficult to obtain for uniform immunization. A phase I/II clinical test is currently being prepared to test a chimerivax-dengue 2 vaccine. Other approaches include subunit candidate vaccines produced from an expression vector, and naked DNA type candidates which are in pre-clinical development. Thus, the development of a tetravalent vaccine against the dengue virus is still an unresolved problem, one of the most important on the list of the World Health Organization.<br>
Thus, there is a need to develop novel effective vaccine candidates which are easy to produce and to formulate, for the prevention or treatment of an infection by a virus of the Flaviviridae family such as the dengue virus.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The originality of the present invention is based on the construction of a chimeric polypeptide and its applications in the prevention or treatment of an Flaviviridae infection. The term "Flaviviridae" means a virus selected from the group constituted by the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. 1.         Polypeptide and polynucleotide<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a peptide of a subdomain of the E protein of Flaviviridae linked to a peptide of a subdomain of the membrane M protein of Flaviviridae. The invention also pertains to a polypeptide which consists of said peptides.<br>
The term "polypeptide" as used in the present invention means both proteins and peptides. By "chimeric polypeptide" it is meant any protein or peptide comprising sub-portions of different origins, for example a polypeptide A deriving from a first species and a polypeptide (protein or peptide) deriving from a second species. A protein or peptide is also considered to be a chimeric polypeptide if it includes sub-portions deriving from different proteins or peptides from the same species, or even from the same protein or peptide from different species.<br>
Preferably, the peptide of a subdomain of the E protein consists of the ectodomain III comprising an amino acid sequence as defined in any one of the following sequences:<br>
•	amino acids 19 to 120ofSEQ ID NO: 1;<br>
•	amino acids 19 to 119 of SEQ ID NO: 3;<br>
•	amino acids 21 to 123 of SEQ ID NO: 6;<br>
•	amino acids 21 to 121 of SEQ ID NO: 12; and<br>
•	amino acids 21 to 123 of SEQ ID NO: 14.<br>
More particularly, the peptide of a subdomain of the E protein consists of a dimer of the ectodomain III of the dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 virus comprising an amino acid sequence as defined in any one of the following sequences:<br>
•	amino acids 21 to 262 of SEQ ID NO: 8; and<br>
•	amino acids 21 to 262 of SEQ ID NO: 10;<br>
or a tetramer of the ectodomain III of the dengue 1,2, 3, 4 virus comprising a sequence ranging from amino acid 21 to 494 of SEQ ID NO: 16 or ranging from amino acid 18 to 429 of SEQ ID NO: 24.<br>
Regarding the peptide of a subdomain of the M protein, this in particular consists of the ectodomain 1-40 comprising an amino acid sequence ranging from position 123 to 170 of SEQ ID NO: 3 or in the apoptoM sequence comprising an amino acid sequence ranging from position 154 to 170 of SEQ ID NO: 3 or ranging from position 122 to 132 of SEQ ID NO: 12.<br>
In a preferred mode, the chimeric polypeptide of the invention further comprises a binding segment binding the peptide of a subdomain of the E protein to the peptide of a subdomain of the M protein. Said binding segment is preferably a pentapeptide with sequence: RRDKR or RREKR.<br>
Highly preferably, the chimeric polypeptide of the invention comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in any one of the following sequences:<br>
a)	amino acids 19 to 172 of SEQ ID NO: 3;<br>
b)	amino acids 21 to 168 of SEQ ID NO: 6;<br>
c)	amino acids 21 to 132 of SEQ ID NO: 12;<br>
d)	amino acids 18 to 624 of SEQ ID NO: 20,<br>
e)	ammo acids 18 to 609 of SEQ ID NO: 21;<br>
f)	amino acids 18 to 624 of SEQ ID NO: 22;<br>
g)	amino acids 18 to 489 of SEQ ID NO: 23; and<br>
h)         ammo acids 21 to 474 of SEQ ID NO: 24.<br>
The invention also relates to polypeptides (and fragments thereof) which are coded by the nucleotide sequences mentioned below.<br>
 Highly preferably, the polypeptide of the invention has a percentage identity of at least<br>
80% after optimum alignment with a sequence as defined in any one of amino acid sequences a) to h) defined above, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% and still more preferably at least 100%.<br>
In a connected aspect, the invention relates to an isolated or purified polynucleotide coding for a chimeric polypeptide as defined above.<br>
By "isolated or purified", it is meant molecules which have been altered by man from their native state, i.e. if such molecules exist in nature, they have been changed and/or removed from their initial environment. As an example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present and found in the biological environment of a living organism which naturally expresses it is not "isolated" in this context. However, the same polynucleotide or polypeptide when separated from its natural environment and/or obtained by cloning, amplification and/or chemical synthesis is considered in the present invention to be "isolated". Further, a polynucleotide or polypeptide which is introduced into an organism by transformation, gene manipulation or any other recombination method is "isolated" even if it is present in said organism.<br>
By the terms "nucleotide sequence", "nucleic acid", "nucleic sequence or nucleic acid sequence", "polynucleotide", oligo nucleotide", "polynucleotide sequence", which will be used indiscriminately in the present description, it is meant a precise chain of nucleotides, which may or may not be modified, which allows to define a fragment or a region of a nucleic acid, which may or may not comprise non-natural nucleotides and which can correspond both to a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA or to transcription products of said DNAs. Thus, the nucleic sequences of the invention also encompass PNAs (peptide nucleic acid) or the like. The polynucleotide fragments of the invention comprise at least 15 consecutive nucleotides. Preferably, they comprise at least 20 consecutive nucleotides and more preferably they comprise at least 30 consecutive nucleotides.<br><br>
 The invention also pertains to fragments of polynucleotides, which consist of fragments<br>
of 15, 20 or 30 successive nucleotides.<br>
Any polynucleotide which has been chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified but which has retained the biochemical properties of the original chimeric polypeptide is included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide of the present invention, when it codes for a chimeric polypeptide of the invention, advantageously comprises a nucleotide sequence as defined in any one of the following sequences:<br>
a)	nucleotides 7 to 492 of SEQ ID NO: 4;<br>
b)	SEQ ID NO: 5;<br>
c)	Nucleotides 7 to 504 of SEQ ID NO: 7;<br>
d)	Nucleotides 7 to 504 of SEQ ID NO: 13; and<br>
e)	SEQ ID NOs: 25 to 29.<br>
Highly preferably, the polynucleotide of the invention has a percentage identity of at least 80% after optimum alignment with a sequence as defined in any one of the nucleotide sequences a) to e) defined above, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% and most preferably at least 100% identity.<br>
The term "percentage identity" between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences as used in the present invention means a percentage of identical nucleotides or amino acid residues between the two sequences to be compared, obtained after best alignment, that percentage being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being randomly distributed and over their entire length. By "best alignment" or "optimum alignment", it is meant the alignment at which the percentage identity determined as below is the highest. Sequence comparisons between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences are traditionally carried out by comparing these sequences after having aligned them in an optimum manner, said comparison being carried out using comparison segments or windows to identify and compare local regions with sequence<br><br>
 similarity. The optimum sequence alignment for comparison may be carried out manually or<br>
using a Smith and Waterman (1981) local homology algorithm, using the Neddleman and Wunsch (1970) local homology algorithm, using the Pearson and Lipman (1988) sequence similarity search method, or using software employing these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST P, BLAST N, FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr, Madison, WI). To obtain an optimal alignment, the BLAST program is preferably used, with the BLOSUM 62 matrix. It is also possible to use PAM or PAM250 matrices.<br>
The percentage identity between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences is determined by comparing these two sequences aligned in an optimum manner, the nucleic acid or amino acid sequence to be compared possibly comprising additions or deletions compared with the reference sequence for optimum alignment between these two sequences. The percentage identity is calculated by determining the number of identical positions for which the nucleotide or amino acid residue is identical between the two sequences, dividing this number of identical positions by the total number of compared positions and multiplying the result obtained by 100 to obtain the percentage identity between these two sequences.<br>
The term "nucleic sequences having a percentage identity of at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% after optimum alignment with a reference sequence", is intended to designate nucleic sequences having, with respect to the reference nucleic acid, certain modifications, in particular a deletion, truncation, extension, chimeric fusion, and/or a substitution, in particular a point substitution, and for which the nucleic sequence has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% identity after optimum alignment with the reference nucleic sequence. Preferably, the specific hybridization conditions or high stringency conditions will be such that they ensure at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% identity after optimum alignment between one of the two sequences and the complementary sequence of the other.<br><br><br>
A hybridization under high stringency conditions means that the temperature and ionic strength conditions are selected so that they can maintain the hybridization between two complementary nucleic acid fragments. By way of illustration, the highly stringent conditions for the hybridization step with the aim of defining the nucleotide sequences described above are advantageously as follows.<br>
DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization is carried out in two steps: (1) pre-hybridization at 42°C for 3 hours in a phosphate buffer (20 mM, ph 7.5) containing 5 x SSC (1 x SSC corresponds to a solution of 0.15 M NaCl + 0.015 M of sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 7% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 10 x Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulphate and 1% salmon sperm DNA; (2) hybridization proper for 20 hours at a temperature depending on the probe size (i.e. :42°C for a probe size &gt; 100 nucleotides), followed by 2 washings of 20 minutes at 20°C in 2 x SSC + 2% SDS, 1 washing of 20 minutes at 20°C in 0.1 x SSC + 0.1% SDS. The final washing is carried out in 0.1 x SSC + 0.1% SDS for 30 minutes at 60°C for a probe size &gt; 100 nucleotides. The high stringency hybridization conditions described above for a polynucleotide of a defined size may be adapted by the skilled person for larger or smaller oligonucleotides, as discussed by Sambrook et al, 1989.<br>
The polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention may be prepared using any appropriate process. They may in particular be obtained by chemical synthesis, but it is also possible to obtain them via a biological route pathway, especially using different vectors in appropriate cell cultures. The peptides of the present invention may, if necessary, be in the deglycosylated or glycosylated form. A person skilled in the field of the invention will be able to obtain different polynucleotides/polypeptides and will also be able to determine which of the polynucleotides/polypeptides obtained have a suitable biological activity. 2. Recombinant viral vector<br>
In a further aspect, the invention concerns a recombinant measles viral vector with a polynucleotide of the invention inserted into the<br>
genome thereof. Such vectors are prepared<br><br>
using methods which are routinely used by the skilled person and the resulting clones may be<br>
introduced into a suitable host using standard methods which are known to the skilled person.<br>
In a preferred mode, the recombinant viral vector of the invention is advantageously a live measles (Schwarz strain) viral vector, such as those selected from the group of viral vectors constituted by those deposited at the CNCM under numbers 1-3440, 1-3442, 1-3452, 1-3453, I-3454,1-3455,1-3619,1-3620,1-3621,1-3622 and 1-3623. The complete antigenome sequence of the measles Schwarz strain virus can, for example, be obtained from pTM plasmids of strains deposited under numbers 1-3440 and 1-3442.<br>

3.	Cloning and/or expression vectors and antibodies<br>
In a further aspect, the invention concerns any cloning and/or expression vector and any cell host (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) transformed by such a vector, and comprising regulation elements allowing the expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for a chimeric polypeptide of the invention. Such vectors are prepared using methods which are routinely used by the skilled person, and the resulting clones may be introduced into an appropriate host using standard methods such as, for example, lipofection, electroporation, thermal shock, transformation after chemical permeabilization of the membrane, or cell fusion.<br>
The invention also encompasses host cells, in particular eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, transformed by the vectors of the invention as well as transgenic animals, preferably mammals, with the exception of man, comprising one of said transformed cells of the invention. These animals may be used as models, to study the etiology of inflammatory and/or immune diseases, and in particular inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract, or in the study of cancers.<br>
Of the cells which may be used in the present invention, the following may be cited: bacterial cells (Olins and Lee (1993), Curr Op Biotechnology 4: 520), but also yeast cells (Buckholz (1993), Curr Op Biotechnology 4, 538), as well as animal cells, in particular mammalian cell cultures (Edwards and Aruffo (1993), Curr Op Biotechnology 4, 558).<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "cloning and/or expression vector" refers to a polynucleotide construct designed to be transfected into different cell types. For this reason, these vectors encompass expression vectors designed for the expression of a nucleotide sequence in a host cell, cloning vectors designed for the isolation, propagation and replication of inserted nucleotides or shuttle vectors which comprise the attributes of more than one vector.<br>

known techniques such as, for example, the technique described by Kolher and Milstein (continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity, Nature (1975), 262: 495-497). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibodies are of the "humanized" type. A person skilled in the art would be able to use his general knowledge to prepare these types of antibodies.<br>

 EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples demonstrate other characteristics and advantages of the present invention and serve to illustrate rather than limit the scope of the present invention. Modifications and variations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Although other methods or products equivalent to those discussed below may be used to test or implement the present invention, preferred equipment and methods are described. Example 1: The recombined measles virus MVsChw-[EDIII + M'^DV-I as a prototype for a candidate vaccine against dengue (PTR156).<br>
Described in Figures 1 and 2, two immunogenic constructs based on the one hand on the capacity of domain III of the envelope E glycoprotein of the dengue virus to induce neutralizing antibodies and on the other hand on the involvement of the ectodomain of the membrane M protein (M1"40) in viral pathogenicity (apoptosis) were inserted into the genome of the attenuated measles virus (Schwarz strain) (MVSchw). The viral sequences were under the dependency of the signal peptide of calreticulin to allow them to be targeted into the secretion pathway. The expression of the [EDIII]Dv-i and [EDIII + M'^JDV-I sequences by the recombined viruses MVSchw was verified in infected Vero cells by indirect immunofluorescence using a polyclonal HMAF mouse serum directed against DV-1 (Figure 3). Secretion of the EDIII and EDIII antigenic domains fused to the M1"40 sequence (with the intercalating pentapeptide RRDKR) of the dengue virus, type-1 (DV-1) of the FGA/89 strain (Holmes E C et al, Mol Biol Evol 16(3): 405-409, 1999 and Despres P et al, Virology 196: 209-219) was observed by Western blot analysis in the supernatants of cells infected with the MVSohw-[EDIII]Dv-i and MVSohw-[EDIII + M1"40]Dv-i virus respectively (Figure 4). Similarly, the production and secretion in the culture supernatants of a S2/[EDIII + M'^DV-I drosophila cell line induced for expression of these proteins has been demonstrated (Figure 5).<br>
Two groups of four adult CD46/FNAR mice were immunized with 104 TCID50 of each of the recombined MVSchw viruses (Tables 1 and 2).  The empty MVSchw virus was used as a<br>
 negative control.   We determined the production of antibodies directed against the MVSchw<br>
virus (MV Ag) and the DV-1 virus (DV-1 Ag) including those which were specific to EDIII (Thullier P et al, 2001, J Gen Virol 82: 1885-1892) and neutralizing (Anti-DV-1 FKNT75) in immunized mice (Tables 1 and 2). We observed that the MVSchw-[EDIII]DV-i virus is less effective at producing specific antibodies to DV-1 or EDIII alone after two inoculations spaced by one month (Table 1). Using the same immunization protocol, we observed that the MVschw-[EDIII + M1"40]^-! virus induced significant liters of antibodies directed against DV-1 and against EDIII alone (Table 2). Anti-DV-1 antibodies including those which were neutralizing were still detected four months after the end of immunization.<br>
When mice immunized more than 6 months previously with MVsChw-[EDIII + M1"40]ov-i were given a booster with a single dose of 5 ng of total proteins of a concentrate of supernatant of S2/[EDIII + M^JDV-I drosophila cells induced for expression of the fusion protein [EDIII + M^^JDV-I and in the presence of Alugel as an adjuvant, large amounts of anti-DV-1, anti-EDIII and neutralizing DV-1 antibodies were observed, which means that there was a well established humoral memory response in the vaccinated animals (Table 2). The anti-DV-1 antibodies were still present several months after the antigenic booster (Table 2).<br>
Three months after the antigenic booster with r[EDIII + M1"40^-!, mice immunized with MVschw-[EDIII + M'^JDV-I were inoculated intrapentoneally with 107 FFU of FGA/NA did strain DV-1 (DV-1 is responsible for an asymptomatic infection in the IFNAR mouse). Large titers of anti-DV-1 antibody (in particular directed against EDIII) including those which neutralized DV-1 Hawaii strain (neutralizing titer # 4000) were observed after 3 weeks of viral challenge (Table 2). It should be noted that mice immunized 9 months previously with MVs0hw [EDIII + M1"30]Dv-i (this construct not inducing anti-EDIII antibody or neutralizing DV-1 antibody) then challenged intraperitoneally with 107 FFU of FGA/NA did strain DV-1 produced anti-DV-1, anti-EDIII and neutralizing titers of 20000, 5000 and 80 respectively; these were<br><br><br>
values equivalent to those observed in BALB/c mice or IFNAR mice challenged under the same<br>
experimental conditions.<br>
In conclusion, the fusion sequence [EDIII + M^Jov-i secreted by the MVSchw-[EDIII + MMO]DV-I virus is capable of generating neutralizing anti-DV-1 antibodies and of inducing a long term humoral memory response which is effectively stimulated on the one hand by the soluble antigen r[EDIII + M^Jov-i and on the other hand in response to a viral infection. In contrast, the only antigenic EDIII domain secreted by the MVsChw-[EDIII + M1"40]Dv-i virus is of low immunogenicity in CD46+-FINAR mice. Our complementary work demonstrates that the pro-apoptotic ApoptoM (M32"40) peptide at the C-terminal end of M determines the immunogenic power of the [EDIII + M1~40]Dv-i fusion sequence since the MVs0hw-[EDIII + M'"30]Dv-i virus without ApoptoM induces a production of anti-DV-1 antibody equivalent to that obtained after immunization with the MVs0hw-[EDIII]Dv-i virus.<br>
As a general methodology for pediatric vaccination against dengue, we propose to immunize young individuals with the MVs0hw-[EDIII + M1"40]DV.i virus using a double inoculation spaced by one month, then to restimulate them later with the soluble r[EDIII + M1"40]Dv-i antigen as a vaccine booster or prophylactically against the risk of an infection by the dengue virus. This immunization strategy is being validated for the four serotypes of dengue based on an antigen composed of a tetramer of the four EDIII domains of DV-1, -2, -3 and -4 fused to the cytotoxic ApoptoM sequence.<br>
Our first experimental results underline the importance of a reduced size immunogen derived from the envelope protein of the DV-1 virus in combination with the immunostimulating capacity of the live measles vector, a strategy which allows the induction of a neutralizing humoral response which is effective against the dengue virus. They define a proof of concept for the design of the tetrameric constructs of the antigenic domains of DV which will allow simultaneous and long term immunization against the four dengue serotypes. Example 2: Construction of chimeric polypeptides optimized for expression in mammals<br>
 In the present example, the inventors have developed novel antigenic constructs useful<br>
against a Flaviviridae infection.<br>
These novel chimeric polypeptides are based on an antigen composed of a tetramer of the four EDIII domains of the four serotypes of the dengue virus, fused together and to one or the other of the cytotoxic apoptoM sequences shown in Figure 30.<br>
Thereafter, these chimeric polypeptides optimized for expression in a mammal were inserted into the genome of the attenuated measles virus, Schwarz strain, (MVSchw) viral strain. Figures 15 to 29 show the amino acid sequences of five preferred chimeric polypeptides and the polynucleotides encoding them.<br>
These chimeric polypeptides were constructed using the following optimization conditions:<br>
Optimization information for these sequences:<br>
•	(Cai No = 0.806, mean %GC = 53.46, GC distribution: homogeneous about 50%);<br>
