				<td>FLUID-GAS SEPARATOR<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] Certain fluid delivery devices need to remove air or other gas from the fluid before it is delivered to a destination. By way of example, in printing devices, such as, inkjet printers, it is desirable to remove air and/or other gases from ink that is being supplied to a printhead because the printhead may malfunction when air or other gases interfere with its operation. Another exemplary fluid delivery device is an intravenous drug/fluid delivery device, wherein it is desirable to remove air or other gases prior to delivering the drug/fluid to a patient.<br>
[0002] To remove air or other gas from a fluid, these and other like fluid delivery devices typically use a purging mechanism that separates the air/gas from the fluid. Such purging mechanisms are typically designed to operate in a particular orientation and as such may fail to operate correctly if their orientation changes. It would be desirable to have a fluid-gas separator that can operate in a variety of different orientations without failing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] Fig. 1 is a block diagram depicting an exemplary fluid delivery device 100, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0013] Fluid delivery device 100 includes a fluid source 102 that is configured to hold at least one fluid.    Fluid source 102 is coupled a drive<br><br>
potential 106 through a conduit 104 in a manner that allows the fluid held in fluid source 102 to be withdrawn via conduit 104. Drive potential 106 is representative of a variety of mechanisms that urge the withdrawal of fluid from fluid source 102 through conduit 104 and then into conduit 108. By way of example, drive potential 106 may include a pump or the like. In certain implementations, drive potential 106 may include an arrangement that employs gravity to urge the movement of the fluid.<br>
[0014] Conduit 108 is further coupled to an inlet of a fluid-gas separator 110. Fluid-gas separator 110 is configured to at least substantially separate gas that may be present in the urged flowing fluid. The separated gas exit fluid-gas separator 110 through a gas outlet. In this example, a conduit 116 directs the gas or gasses to an optional gas destination 118 that collects or otherwise processes the gas in some manner. In certain implementations, gas destination 118 may be configured to return the gas to fluid source 102 or into another component of device 100. In other examples, conduit 116 and/or the gas outlet may be configured to simply release the gas into the atmosphere.<br>
[0015] Fluid-gas separator 110 also includes a fluid outlet that is coupled to conduit 112. The fluid having been separated from the gas continues to be urged by drive potential 106 through conduit 112 to at least one fluid destination 114.<br>
[0016] Conduits 104, 108, 112, and 116 are representative of one or more structures or other arrangements that allow the urging by drive potential 106 of the fluid or fluid-gas mixture to occur. By way of example, in certain implementations such conduits may include tubes, pipes, channels, guides, filters, connectors, valves, gauges, sensors, heaters, etc.<br><br>
[0017] Fig. 1 has been illustrated, through the use of gray shading, to better show the flow of fluid (shaded) and gas (non-shaded) within device 100. As shown by the breaks in the shading within conduits 104 and 108, gas may become mixed with the fluid. Fluid-gas separator 110 separates the gas from the fluid as illustrated by the continuous shading within conduit 112.<br>
[0018] Figs. 2A and 2B are illustrative diagrams depicting a cross-sectional view of an exemplary fluid-gas separator 110, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0019] As shown in Fig. 2A, fluid-gas separator 110 includes a body or housing 202 having an inlet 212 through which a fluid and gas mixture can flow into a chamber 208a within housing 202. Chamber 208a is separated by a chamber 208b by a gas-permeable membrane 204. Gas-permeable membrane 204 is configured to allow gas within chamber 208a to pass through membrane 204 and enter chamber 208b. Gas-permeable membrane 204 is configured to not allow fluid within chamber 208a to enter chamber 208b. Gas that passes through gas-permeable membrane 204 and into chamber 208b may then exit separator 110 via gas outlet 216<br>
[0020] Gas-permeable membrane materials are well known. Gas-permeable membrane 204 may include, for example, a hydrophobic material, an oleophobic material, or the like. As depicted in Fig. 8, gas-permeable membrane 204' may also include two or more layers of materials, such as, an interface layer 802 and a backing layer 804. Such layers may be bonded or otherwise held together. Here, interface layer 802 is configured to allow the gas to pass through it but not the fluid as described above, and backing layer 804 is configured to provide structural support to interface layer 802 while also allowing<br><br>
the gas to pass therethrough. Note that Fig, 8 is illustrative only and hence the layers are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
[0021] Gas-permeable membrane 204/204' may include, for example, a "breathable" or microporous material such as a fabric, membrane, laminate, etc, made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded PTFE, porous PTFE, or other like materials. One example, of such materials includes GORE-TEX ™ ePTFE based membrane material, currently sold for packaging vents in a laminate form by W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc. of Newark, Delaware. This is just one example; those skilled in the art will recognize that other types of gas-permeable materials may also be used.<br>
[0022] Fluid within chamber 208a is urged through a fluid-permeable membrane 206. Fluid-permeable membrane 206 is configured to allow fluid to pass through it from chamber 208a into a fluid outlet 214. Once properly wetted, fluid-permeable membrane 206 is configured to not allow gas to pass through it from chamber 208a into a fluid outlet 214. Instead, the gas within chamber 208a will pass through gas-permeable membrane 204 into chamber 208b as described above.<br>
[0023] Fluid-permeable membrane 206 may include any material that exhibits appropriate fluid-permeability and gas-impermeability properties when wetted. Fluid-permeable membrane 206 may, for example, include hydrophilic, oleophilic, or other like materials. Fluid-permeable membrane 206 may include one or more materials in one or more layers. By way of example, fluid-permeable membrane 206 may include fabric, a screen, a mesh, or the like with openings sized to allow fluid to pass therethrough but not gaseous bubbles once wetted.<br><br>
[0024] In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, once gas-fluid separator 110 is properly primed with the fluid/gas mixture, the amount of pressure (e.g., bubble pressure) needed to force the gas through gas-permeable membrane 204 is less than the amount of pressure needed to force the gas through wetted fluid-permeable membrane 206. Conversely, while gas-fluid separator 110 is primed and operating, the amount of pressure needed to force the fluid through wetted fluid-permeable membrane 206 is less than the amount of pressure needed to force the fluid through non-wetted gas-permeable membrane 204.<br>
[0025] In this example, a portion of membranes 204 and 206 are positioned adjacent one another within chamber 208a with a small gap 210 separating them. Gap 210 is small enough to prevent the gas within chamber 208a from forming one or more bubbles or a layer that significantly or completely covers fluid-permeable membrane 206. If such were to occur, then it is possible that the urged fluid may force some of the gas through fluid-permeable membrane 206. Gap 210 may be sized, therefore, based on any number of factors including, for example, the type of fluid(s), the type of gas(s), membrane characteristics, fluid pressures, etc.<br>
[0026] The size of gap 210 may be determined, for example, by testing gas-permeable membrane 204 using the fluid as illustrated in Fig. 7. The upper drawing shows a side view and the lower drawing shows a top view. Here, a test drop 702 of the fluid is placed onto a non-wetted surface 704 of gas-permeable membrane 206. Test drop 702, in this example, covers an area 706 that is about the same size as a corresponding area of fluid-permeable membrane 206. A test drop height 710 of test drop 702 is then measured. Test<br><br>
drop height 710 may then be considered to represent a maximum size (distance) for gap 210, for example, should separator 110 be intended for operations in different orientations. In certain implementations, gap 210 may therefore be sized to be less than test drop height 710.<br>
[0027] Fig. 3 is an illustrative diagram depicting a cross-sectional view of an exemplary fluid-gas separator 110', in accordance with certain other embodiments of the present invention. Fluid-gas separator 110' is similar to fluid-gas separator 110 of Figs. 2A-B, with the exception that gap 210 between gas-permeable membrane 204 and fluid-permeable membrane 206 no longer exists. Instead, gas-permeable membrane 204 and fluid-permeable membrane 206 are actually in physical contact with one another, forming contact interface 302. In certain embodiments, gas-permeable membrane 204 may be configured to flex or otherwise move in response to fluid pressure within chamber 208a thereby opening contact interface 302 in such a manner to allow fluid to flow from chamber 208a through fluid-permeable membrane 206.<br>
[0028] In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, fluid-gas separators 110 and 110' can be configured to operate in multiple, it not all, orientations by selecting a small enough gap 210 or providing a contact interface 302. In such a configuration gas bubbles should come into contact with gas-permeable membrane 204 before or at about the same time that they would contact fluid-permeable membrane 206. As a result, the gas will flow through gas-permeable membrane, which is configured to provide a lower resistance for gas flow than fluid-permeable membrane 206. Thus, as pressure builds or is applied by the urging of drive potential 106 within chamber 208a the gas will be forced out of the mixture through gas-permeable membrane 204.<br><br>
[0029] The exemplary embodiments of Figs. 2A-B and Fig. 3 illustrate membranes 204 and 206 has having a substantially planer shape. It should be understood, however, that one or both of these membranes may have a non-planer shape. Furthermore, the size and/or surface area of one or more of these membranes may vary depending upon the application. Thus, in certain implementations, membrane 206 may be larger than membrane 204. Also, in certain implementations there may be more than one gas-permeable membrane, and/or more than one fluid-permeable membrane.<br>
[0030] Some exemplary shapes for membranes 204 and/or 206 are illustrated in Figs. 4A-E, in accordance with certain different embodiments of the present invention. Fig. 4A depicts a substantially planer disk shaped gas-permeable membrane 402a and a substantially planer disk shaped fluid-permeable membrane 402b. Fig. 4B depicts a substantially planer rectangular shaped gas-permeable membrane 404a and a substantially planer rectangular shaped fluid-permeable membrane 404b. Fig. 4C depicts a cylindrically shaped gas-permeable membrane 406a and a cylindrically shaped fluid-permeable membrane 406b. Fig. 4D depicts a conically shaped gas-permeable membrane 408a and a conically shaped fluid-permeable membrane 408b. Fig. 4E depicts a spherically shaped gas-permeable membrane 410a and a spherically shaped fluid-permeable membrane 410b.<br>
[0031] Fig. 5 is a block diagram depicting an exemplary printing device 500 having a fluid-gas separator 110 (or 110'), in accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0032] Printing device 500 includes an ink source 502 that is configured to hold ink.   Ink source 502 is coupled a pump 506 through a conduit 504 in a<br><br>
manner that allows the ink held in ink source 502 to be withdrawn via conduit 104. Conduit 508 is further coupled to an inlet of a fluid-gas separator 110 (or 110'). Fluid-gas separator 110 (or 110') is configured to at least substantially separate air that may be present in the urged flowing ink. The separated air exits fluid-gas separator 110 (or 110') through an air outlet 516, whereby the air is released into the atmosphere.<br>
[0033] Fluid-gas separator 110 (or 110') also includes a fluid outlet (not shown) that is coupled to conduit 512. The ink having been separated from the air continues to be urged by pump 506 through conduit 512 to a printhead 514. Printhead 514 is configured to selectively eject droplets of the ink onto a medium (not shown) as part of printing operation.<br>
[0034] Figs. 6A-B are illustrative diagrams depicting cross-sectional views of two exemplary fluid-gas separators 610 and 610', respectively, in accordance with certain further embodiments of the present invention. Fluid-gas separator 610 is similar to fluid-gas separator 110 and fluid-gas separator 610' is similar to fluid-gas separator 110'. In both of these examples, however, gas outlet 216 is inherently formed by housing 602 such that a back-side 620 of gas-permeable membrane 204 is directly exposed to a surrounding environment 622 which functionally serves as chamber 208b.<br>
