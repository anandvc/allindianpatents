				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Filtration Membranes<br>
The present invention relates to filtration membranes, in<br>
particular reusable filtration membranes, as well as methods<br>
for treating these so that they retain consistent pore sizes,<br>
even when subject to harsh washing conditions, for example as<br>
found in a caustic wash.<br>
Filtration of solids from liquids or gases is widely used in<br>
many fields including the biosciences, industrial processing,<br>
laboratory testing, food &amp; beverage, electronics and water<br>
treatment.   Membrane filters are porous or microporous films<br>
used to carry out these types of operation.<br>
Membrane filters (which may also be known as screens, sieves,<br>
microporous filters, microfilters, ultrafilters or nanofilters)<br>
retain solid bodies such as particles or microorganisms etc.<br>
which are larger than their pore size, mainly by surface<br>
capture.  Some particles smaller than the stated pore size may<br>
be retained by other mechanisms.<br>
However, initial selection of membrane filters is generally on<br>
the basis of the pore size and the pore size distribution.  The<br>
precise nature of the pores size is very important, since the<br>
pore size rating will effectively control the utility to which<br>
the membrane filter may be put.<br>
In many cases, the filtration membrane may be used repeatedly<br>
or over prolonged periods.  Frequently in such cases, it is<br>
vital that the membrane is properly washed or otherwise<br>
sanitised between uses, to avoid cross contamination.  The<br>
pores of the filters can harbour particles including<br>
microorganisms, which may present other risks including health<br>
risks.   Thus there is a need to use relatively harsh<br>
conditions including caustic washing agents to avoid these<br>
risks.<br>
Because of the relatively fine and delicate nature of the<br>
porous structure, washing procedures, in particular where harsh<br>
chemicals such as the caustic chemicals found in many cleaning<br>
and sanitising products, can erode the membrane, so that the<br>
pores become larger with time.   Therefore, it is important<br>
that where membrane filters are intended for repeated use that<br>
the pore size retains its integrity and consistency through<br>
repeated washing processes.  Otherwise, the reliability of the<br>
filtering process may be jeopardised.<br>
In order to achieve this reliability, the membranes are made<br>
from materials such as highly resistant and rigid polymers with<br>
a high modulus which have the desired characteristics.<br>
Examples may include PVDF and PTFE, but these materials tend to<br>
be fairly costly.<br>
Plasma deposition techniques have been quite widely used for<br>
the deposition of polymeric coatings onto a range of surfaces,<br>
and in particular onto fabric surfaces.  This technique is<br>
recognised as being a clean, dry technique that generates<br>
little waste compared to conventional wet chemical methods.<br>
Using this method, plasmas are generated from organic<br>
molecules, which are subjected to an electrical field. When<br>
this is done in the presence of a substrate, the radicals of<br>
the compound in the plasma polymerise on the substrate.<br>
Conventional polymer synthesis tends to produce structures<br>
containing repeat units that bear a strong resemblance to the<br>
monomer species, whereas a polymer network generated using a<br>
plasma can be extremely complex.  The properties of the<br>
resultant coating can depend upon the nature of the substrate<br>
as well as the nature of the monomer used and conditions under<br>
which it is deposited.<br>
The applicants have found that by treating filtration membranes<br>
using such a process the properties, in particular the<br>
resistance to repeated washing, may be enhanced significantly.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method<br>
for maintaining pore size of a reusable filtration membrane,<br>
said method comprising exposing said filtration membrane to a<br>
plasma comprising a hydrocarbon or fluorocarbon monomer so as<br>
to form a polymeric layer on the surface thereof.<br>
Treatment in this way has been found to make a reusable<br>
filtration membrane retain pore size much more consistently,<br>
even when subject to caustic washing.<br>
As used herein, the expression "caustic washing" refers to any<br>
procedure in which chemical cleaning agents containing highly<br>
alkaline components such as sodium hydroxide are utilised. This<br>
includes many cleaning and sanitising products including<br>
bleaches and the like.<br>
Suitable filtration membranes will be those made of a synthetic<br>
polymeric material.  However, in view of the enhancement<br>
conveyed by the process of the invention, the polymeric<br>
material may generally be of a cheaper or lower cost polymer<br>
than has been used hitherto, where resistance to washing has<br>
proved to be a limiting factor.  Thus for example,<br>
polyethylene filtration membranes may be produced which have<br>
good wash resistance and therefore may be used.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the polymeric material deposited,<br>
the filtration membrane treated in this way may also be water<br>
and oil repellent, and also resistant to clogging. They may<br>
have useful "shake dry" properties also, reducing risk of<br>
contamination after washing.<br>
Furthermore, the enhancement material or layer becomes<br>
molecularly bound to the surface and so there are no<br>
leachables; the modification becomes part of the membrane.<br>
Membranes treated in accordance with the invention retain their<br>
porosity, as the coating layer deposited thereon is only<br>
molecules thick.  Therefore, the liquid or even small particles<br>
can continue to pass through them, in particular when a<br>
positive pressure is applied to the liquid, or a negative<br>
pressure is applied to the other side of the membrane to draw<br>
the liquid through.  However, larger particles will not pass<br>
through the membrane.<br>
Any monomer that undergoes plasma polymerisation or<br>
modification of the surface to form a suitable polymeric<br>
coating layer or surface modification on the surface of the<br>
filtration membrane may suitably be used.  Examples of such<br>
monomers include those known in the art to be capable of<br>
producing hydrophobic polymeric coatings on substrates by<br>
plasma polymerisation including, for example, carbonaceous<br>
compounds having reactive functional groups, particularly<br>
substantially -CF3 dominated perfluoro compounds (see WO<br>
97/38801), perfluorinated alkenes (Wang et al., Chem Mater<br>
1996, 2212-2214), hydrogen containing unsaturated compounds<br>

In general, the filtration membrane to be treated is placed<br>
within a plasma chamber together with the material to be<br>
deposited in gaseous state, a glow discharge is ignited within<br>
the chamber and a suitable voltage is applied, which may be<br>
pulsed.<br>
The polymeric coating may be produced under both pulsed and<br>
continuous-wave plasma deposition conditions but pulsed plasma<br>
may be preferred as this allows closer control of the coating,<br>
and so the formation of a more uniform polymeric structure.<br>
As used herein, the expression "in a gaseous state" refers to<br>
gases or vapours, either alone or in mixture, as well as<br>
aerosols.<br>
Precise conditions under which the plasma polymerization takes<br>
place in an effective manner will vary depending upon factors<br>
such as the nature of the polymer, the filtration membrane<br>
treated including both the material from which it is made and<br>
the pore size etc. and will be determined using routine methods<br>
and/or the techniques.<br>
Suitable plasmas for use in the method of the invention include<br>
non-equilibrium plasmas such as those generated by<br>
radiofrequencies (RF), microwaves or direct current (DC).  They<br>
may operate at atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressures as are<br>
known in the art.  In particular however, they are generated by<br>
radiofrequencies (RF) .<br>
Various forms of equipment may be used to generate gaseous<br>
plasmas.  Generally these comprise containers or plasma<br>
chambers in which plasmas may be generated.  Particular<br>
examples of such equipment are described for instance in<br>
WO2005/089961 and WO02/28548, but many other conventional<br>
plasma generating apparatus are available.<br>
The gas present within the plasma chamber may comprise a vapour<br>
of the monomer alone, but it may be combined with a carrier<br>
gas, in particular, an inert gas such as helium or argon, if<br>
required.  In particular helium is a preferred carrier gas as<br>
this can minimise fragmentation of the monomer.<br>
When used as a mixture, the relative amounts of the monomer<br>
vapour to carrier gas is suitably determined in accordance with<br>
procedures which are conventional in the art.  The amount of<br>
monomer added will depend to some extent on the nature of the<br>
particular monomer being used, the nature of the substrate<br>
being treated, the size of the plasma chamber etc.  Generally,<br>
in the case of conventional chambers, monomer is delivered in<br>
an amount of from 50-250mg/minute, for example at a rate of<br>
from 100-150mg/minute. It will be appreciated however, that the<br>
rate will vary depending on the reactor size chosen and the<br>
number of substrates required to be processed at once; this in<br>
turn depends on considerations such as the annual through-put<br>
required and the capital outlay.<br>
Carrier gas such as helium is suitably administered at a<br>
constant rate for example at a rate of from 5-90 standard cubic<br>
centimetres per minute (seem) , for example from 15-30sccm.  In<br>
some instances, the ratio of monomer to carrier gas will be in<br>
the range of from 100:0 to 1:100, for instance in the range of<br>
from 10:0 to 1:100, and in particular about 1:0 to 1:10. The<br>
precise ratio selected will be so as to ensure that the flow<br>
rate required by the process is achieved.<br>
In some cases, a preliminary continuous power plasma may be<br>
struck for example for from 15 seconds to 10 minutes, for<br>
example from 2-10 minutes within the chamber.  This may act as<br>
a surface pre-treatment step, ensuring that the monomer<br>
attaches itself readily to the surface, so that as<br>
polymerisation occurs, the coating "grows" on the surface.  The<br>
pre-treatment step may be conducted before monomer is<br>
introduced into the chamber, in the presence of only an inert<br>
gas..<br>
The plasma is then suitably switched to a pulsed plasma to<br>
allow polymerisation to proceed, at least when the monomer is<br>
present.<br>
In all cases, a glow discharge is suitably ignited by applying<br>
a high frequency voltage, for example at 13.56MHz.  This is<br>
applied using electrodes, which may be internal or external to<br>
the chamber, but in the case of larger chambers are generally<br>
internal.<br>
Suitably the gas, vapour or gas mixture is supplied at a rate<br>
of at least 1 standard cubic centimetre per minute (seem) and<br>
preferably in the range of from 1 to lOOsccm.<br>
In the case of the monomer vapour, this is suitably supplied at<br>
a rate of from 80-300mg/minute, for example at about<br>
120mg/minute depending upon the nature of the monomer, the size<br>
of the chamber and the surface area of the product during a<br>
particular run whilst the pulsed voltage is applied.  It may<br>
however, be more appropriate for industrial scale use to have a<br>
fixed total monomer delivery that will vary with respect to the<br>
defined process time and will also depend on the nature of the<br>
monomer and the technical effect required.<br>
Gases or vapours may be delivered into the plasma chamber using<br>
any conventional method.  For example, they may be drawn,<br>
injected or pumped into the plasma region.  In particular,<br>
where a plasma chamber is used, gases or vapours may be drawn<br>
into the chamber as a result of a reduction in the pressure<br>
within the chamber, caused by use of an evacuating pump, or<br>
they may be pumped, sprayed, dripped, electrostatically ionised<br>
or injected into the chamber as is common in liquid handling.<br>
Polymerisation is suitably effected using vapours of compounds<br>
for example of formula (I), which are maintained at pressures<br>
of from 0.1 to 400mtorr, suitably at about 10-100mtorr.<br>
The applied fields are suitably of power of from 5 to 500W for<br>
example from 20 to 500W, suitably at about 100W peak power,<br>
applied as a continuous or pulsed field.  Where used, pulses<br>
are suitably applied in a sequence which yields very low<br>
average powers, for example in a sequence in which the ratio of<br>
the time on : time off is in the range of from 1:500 to 1:1500.<br>
Particular examples of such sequence are sequences where power<br>
is on for 20-50us, for example about 30us, and off for from<br>
lQOOus to 30000ns, in particular about 20Q00us.  Typical<br>
average powers obtained in this way are 0.01W.<br>
The fields are suitably applied from 30 seconds to 90 minutes,<br>
preferably from 5 to 60 minutes, depending upon the nature of<br>
the compound of formula (I) and the filtration membrane.<br>
Suitably a plasma chamber used is of sufficient volume to<br>
accommodate multiple membranes.<br>
A particularly suitable apparatus and method for producing<br>
filtration membranes in accordance with the invention is<br>
described in WO2005/089961, the content of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
In particular, when using high volume chambers of this type,<br>
the plasma is created with a voltage as a pulsed field, at an<br>
average power of from 0.001 to 500W/m3, for example at from<br>
0.001 to 100W/m3 and suitably at from 0.005 to 0.5W/m3.<br>
These conditions are particularly suitable for depositing good<br>
quality uniform coatings, in large chambers, for example in<br>
chambers where the plasma zone has a volume of greater than<br>
500cm3, for instance 0.1m3 or more, such as from 0.5m3-10m3 and<br>
suitably at about Im3.  The layers formed in this way have good<br>
mechanical strength.<br>
The dimensions of the chamber will be selected so as to<br>
accommodate the particular filtration membrane or batch of<br>
membranes being treated.  For instance, generally cuboid<br>
chambers may be suitable for a wide range of applications, but<br>
if necessary, elongate or rectangular chambers may be<br>
constructed or indeed cylindrical, or of any other suitable<br>
shape.<br>
The chamber may be a sealable container, to allow for batch<br>
processes, or it may comprise inlets and outlets for the<br>
filtration membranes, to allow it to be utilised in a<br>
continuous process as an in-line system.  In particular in the<br>
latter case, the pressure conditions necessary for creating a<br>
plasma discharge within the chamber are maintained using high<br>
volume pumps, as is conventional for example in a device with a<br>
"whistling leak".  However it will also be possible to process<br>
filtration membranes at atmospheric pressure, or close to,<br>
negating the need for "whistling leaks".<br>
A further aspect of the invention comprises a reusable<br>
filtration membrane which has been treated by a method as<br>
described above.  In particular, the membrane is of a synthetic<br>
polymeric material, such as polyethylene.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a method of<br>
filtering a liquid, said method comprising passing a sample of<br>
liquid through a filtration membrane as described above, and<br>
after use, washing the filtration membrane in a caustic or<br>
other cleaning solution in preparation for reuse.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a<br>
polymerised fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon coating, deposited by a<br>
plasma polymerisation process, for making a filtration membrane<br>
resistant to chemical attack, such as that to which they are<br>
subjected during cleaning.   Suitable fluorocarbon and<br>
hydrocarbon coatings are obtainable as described above.<br>
The invention will now be particularly described by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic<br>
drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a series of graphs showing the pores size<br>
distribution data for the filtration membrane sold as E-14P02E<br>
samples, plotted as cumulative oversize curves; wherein (a)<br>
shows the results of membranes without  treatment in accordance<br>
with the method of the invention before {•) and after (A)<br>
washing in caustic soda; (b) shows the results of membranes<br>
treated in accordance with the method of the invention before<br>
(•) and after (A) washing in caustic soda; and (c) shows the<br>
results of membranes before (•) and after (A) treatment using<br>
the method of the invention; and<br>
Example 1<br>
Wash test<br>
A series of membranes were produced by subjecting a<br>
polyethylene filtration membrane, sold as E-14P02E, to a plasma<br>
procedure.  Samples of E-14P02E were placed into a plasma<br>
chamber with a processing volume of ~ 300 litres. The chamber<br>
was connected to supplies of the required gases and or vapours,<br>
via a mass flow controller and/or liquid mass flow meter and a<br>
mixing injector or monomer reservoir as appropriate.<br>
The chamber was evacuated to between 3 and 10 mtorr base<br>
pressure before allowing helium into the chamber at 20 seem<br>
until a pressure of 80 mtorr was reached.  A continuous power<br>
plasma was then struck for 4 minutes using RF at 13.56 MHz at<br>
300 W.<br>
After this period, 1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecylacylate (CAS<br>
# 27905-45-9) of formula<br>
was brought into the chamber at a rate of 120 milligrams per<br>
minute,and the plasma switched to a pulsed plasma at 30<br>
microseconds on-time and 20 milliseconds off-time at a peak<br>
power of 100 W for 40 minutes. On completion of the 40 minutes<br>
the plasma power was turned off along with the processing gases<br>
and vapours and the chamber evacuated back down to base<br>
pressure. The chamber was then vented to atmospheric pressure<br>
and the membrane samples removed.<br>
The pore size distribution of both a treated and untreated<br>
membrane was measured both before and after immersion in<br>
caustic soda (NaOH) solution.  Caustic soda (NaOH) was used in<br>
the tests as it is a component of many cleaning and sanitising<br>
chemicals for membranes.  For example, Floclean MCll is used<br>
for the removal of foulants composed of organics, silts, or<br>
biological materials from membranes and contains 1% NaOH; to<br>
remove fats and oils, proteins, polysaccharides, and bacteria<br>
from membranes by hydrolysis and oxidation, a solution<br>
containing 0.5N NaOH is recommended (C. Munir,   Ultrafiltration<br>
and Microfiltration Handbook,   2nd edition,   CRC Press).<br>
The pores size distribution data for untreated and treated<br>
membranes is shown in Figure 1(a) and (lb) respectively.<br>
The results show that in the untreated membrane, the pore sizes<br>
have been increased considerably by the NaOH.  This results<br>
from damage to the pore structure, and points to the fact that<br>
the sample is not chemically resistant to NaOH.  However, the<br>
pore size remained largely constant in the treated membrane<br>
indicating a high level of NaOH resistance.  Therefore, the<br>
treatment protected the sample from NaOH attack.  The pore size<br>
distribution was not changed by the NaOH immersion.<br>
Example 2<br>
Effect on pore size of treatment.<br>
The pore size distributions of the E-14P02E membrane samples<br>
before and after treatment as described in Example 1 were also<br>
measured.   The pore size distribution was found to be narrow;<br>
which is advantageous for filtration applications, where the<br>
'best' membranes would have a monosized distribution of pore<br>
sizes.  Taking account of the errors in the measurement<br>
technique, there appears to be no significant difference<br>
between the pore size distributions of the two membranes,<br>
indicating that this remains unaffected by the treatment.<br>
