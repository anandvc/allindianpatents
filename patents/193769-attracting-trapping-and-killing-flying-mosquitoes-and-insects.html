				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a device for killing flies and<br>
other insects.  The present invention particularly relates to a<br>
device useful f©r trapping and killing mosquites,  Female mosquitees<br>
require blood as food and hence live in the visinity of human dewllings<br>
and animal houses.  They fly in search of food more often after sun set<br>
and get back for rest before sunrise.  /When there is strong light its<br>
movement is minimum.  They are also drifted away when there is strong<br>
wiad.  In a room the density of flying mosquitoes will be maximum in<br>
an area eevering six feet from ground level.<br>
By destroying the female mosquitoes it is easier to control their<br>
population, as one female after consuming blood lay several hundred<br>
eggs which grew to female and male mssquitaes within ten days.<br>
Female mosquitoes while consuming blood from hiirnan and animals, transmit<br>
diseases like Malaria, Encephalitis, Filariasis and also cause allergic<br>
reactions ©n skin resulting in sleepless nights.  Flies also contaminat<br>
food materials which results in the transmission of several diseasoes<br>
like Cholera, Enteritis etc.<br>
Conventional methods empleyed t© drive away the mosquitoes are the<br>
burning smoke of Neem leaf, Tea waste. Rosin, Desangam, Elephant dung.<br>
Dried lemongrass leaves etc.<br>
At present flies are destroyed in their breeding place by the use of<br>
chemicals such as larvicldee, mineral oil sprays to block the<br>
respiratory process of the larva which results in their death.<br>
Insecticides and pesticides like B.H.C., D.D.T., Malathion, Sumathion<br>
Flit etc are also used against them.<br>
Another common method is the use of mosquito repellents like Good Night,<br>
Tortoise, Rooster or creams t© smear on the body like Odomos sr creams<br>
containing lemon grass oil.  By this method mosquitoes are driven frea<br>
one place to another.  They return back once the repellent action is<br>
over.  Repellents are costly and is meant for repeated use.<br><br>
Repellents will not kill mosquitoes.  Many of them cause allergic<br>
reactions like Asthama, Rhinitis and also create suffocation.<br>
Another method is the use of mosquito net to keep off the mosquitoes.<br>
Mesquits nets are costly and give protectisa anly when you are inside<br>
the net.  During summer it is very difficult t© sleep inside a mosquito<br>
net as the air circulation inside the net is limited.  Accidental<br>
entry ©f mosquitoes inside the net is sufficient to cause sleeplessness.<br>
Another method now employed is the use of a bacteria by name Bacillus<br>
Thurin Jainsis Isralinasis with a Protoxin which selectively kills the<br>
mosquito larvae.  The cost of which Rs 750/- per kilogram, which a<br>
common man cannot afford.  It is used as a spray which has to lie<br>
repeated again after ten days in larva breeding water.  The dead larvae<br>
decay in the water,<br>
yet another method is the use of Ultra Violet lamp for attracting<br>
mosquitoes and killing the same by electrocution.  This method is very<br>
costly and require the use of imported Ultra Violet lamps.  The<br>
burning smell of insects and the possible electrical shock limits<br>
its use.<br>
Another method  is the use of aerosol sprays like Hit, Hexit etc.<br>
The chemical is directly sprayed on the insect to kill it.  It is to<br>
be repeated again and again.  The high cost, manual labour <br>
required for each spray, contamination and enviornmental pollution<br>
etc; prohibits its use.<br>
G-overnment of India and the State Governments are speeding huge amounts<br>
for the control of mosquitoes under Malaria, Encephalitis and fi<br>
filariasis control schemes.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a Sevase device,<br>
for the trapping and killing of flies which can be operated easily and<br>
does not pollute the enviornment.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device for<br><br>
trapping and killing flies particularly mosquitoes which is economical and therefore within the reach of comsnon man.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a device which not only traps and kills the flies hut ale© previde filtered fresh air into the room.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device for the easy disposal of the dead mosquitoes in large numbers. The present invention is based on the principle that the flies such as mosquitoes are attracted towards a running fan and are sucked from the catchment area due to the drifting force created by the running fan and on hitting forcefully on the leaves of the fan or on the net provided leads to their death and the dead insects fall down and get collected in a disposable bag.<br>
When a working fan is covered by a cylindrical hood with a hard net at one end; the length of the hood to exeed the length of the fan leaf but not to exeed twice the length of the leaf; there will be a concentration of wind force towards the leaves of the fan from behind. A large area behind the fan will have this drifting force and this area is referred as the catchment area.  Flying speed ef many insects like flies and mosq,uitoes are far less than the drifting force in the catchment area when the fan is running.  The mosquitoes and flies which fly near the catchment area are sucked towards the fan while it iE running and hit forcefully on the leaves or on the hard net and get killed.  The dead insects fall down and get collected through a receptacle.  To attract mosquitoes which are not flying near the fan, a red coloured light may be fixed at the appropriate place in the device and a black coloured shallow trough half filled with water placed behind the fan and below the catchment area.  This will improove the efficiency of the device by attracting and killing more mosquitoes<br><br>
The device of the present invention is illustrated in the figures accompanying this specifioation. In the drawings<br>
Fig: 1 represents the side view of the present invention. Pig: 2 represents the front view of the device.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for attracting and trapping and killing of insects such as flies and mosquitoes which coniprises a hood (l) one side of which is fitted with a net (2) and the other end being provided witn a perforated sheet (3) an exhaust fan (6) being fixed inside the hood at the end where the net is provided with its blade facing the net so as to create a suction force inside the hood when the fan is running, the length of the hood to exeed the length of the leaf of the fan but not to exeed twice the length of the leaf, the fan being provided with leads for supplying current, the lower portion of the hood at the end where the net is provided with a receptacle (4) to collect dead flies and mosquitoes, at an appropriate place inside the hood provision may be made to fix one bulb (7)<br>
The hood may be made of raetal, plastic, wood or laminated sheet.  The net used may be metallic meeh or hard plastic net.  The bulb employed may preferabily be of red colour and may be of 15 watt.  A trough preferabily black coloured may be placed below the catchment area, half filled with water to attract mosquitoes.  When the fan is working covered by the hood with net at one end, the length of the hood to exeed the length of the fan leaf but not to exeed twice the length of the leaf; there will be a concentration of wind force towards the fan leaf from behind the fan.  A large area behind the fan will have this drifting force and this area is referred to as the catchment area.  The flying speed of mosquitoes and other flying insects are far less than this drifting force in the catchment area.  When insects like mosquitoes happen to fly near this oatchinent area they are sucked into the chamber<br><br><br>
Towards the fan.  These flies consequently get hit forcefully agaiast the fan leaves and the hard net and get killed.  To attract more insects like mosquitoes and flies to the catchment area a 15 watt red coloured bulb may be used.  Dead insects like mosquitoes fall down and get collected in the receptacle. The advantages of the invention<br>
1.	The device is safe and efficient as it can. kill maximum number of mosquijoes, flies and other insects.<br>
2.	The device has long life andwiii will be one tisie investiwent.<br>
3.	The device can be used anywhere.<br>
4.	Prolonged use of the device will eleminate the flies and mosquitoes from the enviornment.<br>
5.	The device is simple to operate.<br>
6.	The device is very economical and can be afforded by a common man<br>
7.	No chemicals, pesticides or insecticides used,<br>
S,  The dead flies, mosquitoes and other insects can be removed easily without causing pollution to the enviornment<br>
