A SYSTEM FOR EFFECTING A TELEPHONE CALL OVER A COMPUTER<br>
NETWORK WITHOUT ALPHANUMERIC KEYPAD OPERATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for effecting a telephone call<br>
between telephonic devices. The present invention also relates to novel uses of a web<br>
browser and Internet capable software.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a category of hardware and software<br>
that enables the user to use a computer network such as the Internet as the<br>
transmission medium for telephone calls by sending voice data in packets using<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) rather than by traditional circuit transmissions of the Public<br>
Switch Telephone Network (PSTN). This eliminates circuit switching and the<br>
associated waste of bandwidth. Instead, packet switching is used, wherein IP packets<br>
with voice data are sent over the network only when data needs to be sent, i.e. when a<br>
party to the call is speaking.<br>
The advantages of VoIP over traditional telephony include, by way example,<br>
lower costs per call, especially for long-distance calls, and lower infrastructure costs.<br>
That is, once the IP infrastructure is installed, no or little additional telephony<br>
infrastructure is required.<br>
However, despite the technological flexibility of a VoIP system, callers are<br>
still limited to initiating calls manually, that is by using the keypad on a telephone.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
there is an art desired need to greatly reduce or eliminate the user's manual activities<br>
in initiating a telephone call, including the telephone keypad operation.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide a system<br>
for effecting a telephone call between telephonic devices using a computer network<br>
without manual use of the telephonic device keypads.<br>
The third party call control (3PCC) application program interface (API) of the<br>
present invention provides the capability for users to use a web browser or other<br>
Internet capable software to place a call. This eliminates using the telephone keypad.<br>
The open, nature of the API also provides the capability to integrate 3PCC<br>
functionality with new or existing applications, such as customer relationship<br>
management (CRM), contact management applications, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a third party call control<br>
application program interface includes a first uniform resource locator operable over<br>
the Internet to cause a call or connection between a first telephonic device and a<br>
second telephonic device to be completed. The first uniform resource locator<br>
includes identification of the first telephonic device and identification of the second<br>
telephonic device.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the first uniform resource locator may<br>
be generated on a computer system that is communicatively connected to the Internet.<br>
The call may be completed by initiating a call to the first telephone device and<br>
transferring the call, so as to complete the call, to the second telephone device, when<br>
the call to the first telephone device is answered. The call may be initiated to the first<br>
telephone device using the Session Initiation Protocol INVITE method. The call may<br>
be transferred to the second telephone device using the Session Initiation Protocol<br>
REFER method.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the identification of the first telephonic<br>
device may include identification of a telephone number of the first telephone device<br>
and the identification of the second telephonic device may include a telephone<br>
number of the second telephonic device. The telephonic devices may be conventional<br>
telephones. However, the present invention contemplates any present or fixture<br>
telephonic device. The third party call control application program may further<br>
include identification of an account to be billed. The identification of the first<br>
telephonic device includes a telephone number of the first telephone device and the<br>
identification of the second telephonic device includes a telephone number of the<br>
second telephonic device. The identification of the account to be billed may include<br>
the telephone number of the first telephonic device, the telephone number of the<br>
second telephonic device, or the telephone number of a third telephonic device.<br>
In one further aspect of the present invention, the third party call control<br>
application program may further include a second uniform resource locator operable<br>
over the Internet to obtain information identifying an account to be billed. The<br>
information identifying an account to be billed may also include at least one<br>
telephone number. At least one of the first uniform resource locator identification of<br>
the first telephone device and the first uniform resource locator identification of the<br>
second telephone device may include at least one telephone number obtained by the<br>
second uniform resource locator.<br>
In a still further aspect of the present invention, the third party call control<br>
application program includes identification and password information; such<br>
information is authenticated and validated before the call is completed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The third party call control (3PCC) application program interface (API) of the<br>
present invention provides the capability for users to use a web browser or other<br>
Internet capable software to place a call. This eliminates using a keypad such as the<br>
alpha/numeric keypad on a conventional telephone. The open nature of the API also<br>
provides the capability to integrate 3PCC functionality with new or existing,<br>
applications like customer relationship management (CRM), contact management<br>
applications, and the like.<br>
A system in which the present invention may be implemented is shown in Fig.<br>
1. In one embodiment, a user computer system 102 is used to access the Internet and<br>
invoke the 3PCC API using a secure hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTPS) uniform<br>
resource locator (URL) 104 (secure sockets layer (SSL)). The URL 104 is used to<br>
pass authorization credentials, such as login information, along with at least two<br>
phone numbers, a "from" number and a "to" number. An example of a suitable URL<br>
is:<br>
https://secure.url.com/tpcc/makecall?username=aw&amp;password=secret<br>
&amp;<br>
from number=1732555111 l&amp;tonumber=1732555,2222<br>
This URL includes specification of the secure hyper-text transfer protocol<br>
(https:), the Internet address of web server 106 (secure.url.com), the action to be<br>
performed by web server 106 (makecall), the authorization credentials<br>
(username=aw&amp;password=secret), the telephone number of the telephone from which<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
the call is to originate (fromnumber=17325551111) and the telephone number of the<br>
telephone to which the call is to be completed (tonumber=17325552222).<br>
The HTTP URL activates a secure web server 106, which authenticates the<br>
user and passes the information to a CallController system 108. Preferably, the<br>
information is passed from secure web server 106 to CallController 108 using a<br>
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 110. The CallController 108 is a trusted peer of<br>
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy server 114.<br>
SIP is a signaling protocol for Internet conferencing, telephony, presence,<br>
events notification and instant messaging. SIP provides the necessary protocol<br>
mechanisms so that end systems and proxy servers can provide services such as call<br>
completion, call forwarding, callee and calling "number" delivery, personal<br>
mobility, terminal-type negotiation and selection, terminal capability negotiation,<br>
caller and callee authentication, blind and supervised call transfer, invitations to<br>
multicast conferences.<br>
A goal for SIP was to provide a superset of the call processing functions and<br>
features present in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). As such, features<br>
that permit familiar telephone-like operations are present: dialing a number, causing a<br>
phone to ring, hearing ringback tones or a busy signal. Implementation and<br>
terminology are different; for example, SIP refers to a device being in an "alerting<br>
state" rather than a "ringing."<br>
In response to receiving the RPC 110 from secure web server 106,<br>
CallController 108 invokes a number of SIP methods 112 involving SIP proxy server<br>
114. In response, SIP proxy server 114 invokes those SIP methods 116 to the<br>
appropriate target. In addition, SIP proxy server 114 monitors any calls that are<br>
initiated and completed, in order to handle the necessary billing functions.<br>
In particular, CallController 108 initiates a call from CallController 108 to the<br>
"from" number, using the SIP INVITE method. SIP proxy server 114 in turn invokes<br>
the SIP INVITE method 116 targeting the "from" telephone 118. The technique used<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
to invoke the SIP INVITE method depends upon the type of "from" telephone 118<br>
involved. For example, if the "from" telephone 118 is an Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
telephone, the SP INVITE method 120B may be invoked directly on the "from"<br>
telephone 118, since the IP telephone is capable of performing the necessary<br>
functions in response to the invocation of the SIP INVITE method. Alternatively, if<br>
the "from" telephone 118 is a standard Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)<br>
telephone, then the SIP INVITE method is invoked using a PSTN gateway server<br>
120A to initiate the call. In either case, a call to the "from" telephone 118 is initiated.<br>
When the "from" telephone 118 answers, CallController 108 initiates a call<br>
transfer to transfer the call to the "from" telephone 118 from the origin of the call,<br>
CallController 108, to the "to" telephone 122 number, using the SIP REFER method.<br>
This terminates the initial call between the CallController and the "from" telephone<br>
118, and triggers the "from" telephone 118 to initiate a new call to the "to" telephone<br>
122. This call is billed to the appropriate account.<br>
There are three possible numbers to which the call may be billed - the "from"<br>
number, the "to" number, or a third "billto" number. The number to which the call is<br>
billed must belong to a subscriber of the telephone service provider. Thus, if the<br>
"from" number belongs to the subscriber, the call is billed to the "from" number, if<br>
the "to" number belongs to the subscriber, the call is billed to the "to" number, if<br>
neither the "from" number nor the "to" number belong to the subscriber, a third<br>
number must be billed. This third number may be supplied in the URL 104 or it may<br>
be associated with the user name that was used to login. An example of a suitable<br>
URL including a "billto" number is:<br>
https://secure.url.com/tpcc/makecall?username=aw&amp;password=secret&amp;<br>
fromnumber=1732555111 l&amp;tonumber=17325552222&amp;<br>
bill to number=17325553333<br>
Preferably, an additional HTTPS URL is exposed which allows an application<br>
to retrieve a list of phone numbers in a user's account. This URL passes authorization<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
credentials (login information) and returns the phone numbers associated with the<br>
account corresponding to that login information. This list can be presented to the user<br>
to select which number is to initiate the call (the "from" number), and/or to select<br>
which number is to be billed for the call (the "billto" number).<br>
Although, typically, user computer system 102 is used to initiate the telephone<br>
calls, calls may also be initiated from a third party telephone 124. Third party<br>
telephone 124 would dial into an interactive voice response (IVR) system 126 and<br>
would be used to enter the information needed to initiate the telephone call. IVR 126<br>
would pass the information to Call Controller 108 using RPC 128. The system would<br>
then initiate the call in a manner similar to that for a call initiated from user computer<br>
system 102.<br>
The third party telephone configuration slightly changes the role of "from"<br>
telephone 118, as compared to the configuration involving only the "to" and "from"<br>
telephones. Both "to" telephone 122 and "from" telephone 118 become the "to"<br>
telephones. If the third party places a call to "from" telephone 118, SIP proxy server<br>
114 invokes sip invite methods 116, as discussed above. However, if third party<br>
telephone 124 is trying to reach "to" telephone 122, the inventive system may have<br>
an alternative and additional communication link 500 adaptively operable in response<br>
to invoking methods similar to sip invite methods 116 by Proxy Server 114.<br>
As a further possibility, CALL CONTROLLER SERVER 108 can always<br>
directly call "to" telephone 122 using the link similar to communication link 500.<br>
One of possible scenarios involving such a direct connection may involve, a situation<br>
when the caller operating the "from" telephone does not want experience any delays<br>
due to the busy line. Instructing the controller server to initiate contact with the "to"<br>
telephone and, once the operator of the "to" telephone answers the call from the<br>
controller server, actually connecting the "from" and "to" telephones may save the<br>
operator of the "from" telephone time.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
The configuration of the inventive system involving third party telephone 124<br>
may have numerous practical ramifications and be used in a variety of ways. For<br>
instance, one potential use of this is similar to a "calling card". The subscriber could<br>
initiate a call from any telephone, such as their hotel room telephone or a pay<br>
telephone, to any other phone, while billing the call to their own account.<br>
Examples of users of the services provided by the present invention include<br>
business users who have a large phone book of users they need to call (e.g. sales<br>
calls), or by telemarketing operations. In this situation, the subscriber uses the "from"<br>
telephone and the calls are billed to the "from" number.<br>
For example, this could be implemented in phone or address book software,<br>
such as using a plug-in to an email program such as MICROSOFT OUTLOOK®, or<br>
in contact manager software. An example of such an implementation is shown in Fig. -<br>
2. In this example, a contacts window 202 includes a plurality of contacts entries<br>
204A-C. Each contact entry 204A-C includes a contact address 208A-C and a<br>
contact telephone number 210A-C. Associated with each contact telephone number<br>
210A-C is a software control, which, when activated, causes the telephone number<br>
210A-C to be dialed using the third party call control system shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
software control may take any form. For example, the software control may be a<br>
button or an active area associated with the telephone number 210A-C. Alternatively,<br>
the software control may be a hotkey, which may operate, for example, by a user<br>
selecting a telephone number and then pressing the hotkey. These are merely<br>
examples of suitable software controls; any software control with adequate<br>
functionality may be used.<br>
In order to dial the telephone number 210A-C using the third party call control<br>
system shown in Fig. 1, a URL, such as those shown above, is used. The telephone<br>
number 210A-C is included in the URL, typically as the "to" number. The "from"<br>
number would typically be the phone number of a phone available to the person<br>
initiating the call. The "billto" number may be omitted from the URL, in which case<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
the "from" number would typically be billed, or a third "billto" number may be<br>
included in the URL.<br>
Additional enhancement to this functionality include the capability to scan<br>
pages and documents for character strings that appear to be telephone numbers.<br>
These telephone numbers may be highlighted for the user. The user may then dial<br>
any such telephone number by selecting the number and pressing the hotkey or other<br>
software control.<br>
Preferably, the implementation includes sufficient intelligence to understand<br>
the formats of telephone numbers, including international telephone numbers, as well<br>
as the ability to filter the characters in the telephone number to strip characters such<br>
as parentheses, hyphens, etc.<br>
In another embodiment, subscribers are able to distribute software objects that<br>
provide the capability for the recipient of the object to call the subscriber. Typically,<br>
the software object is distributed using email, but it may be distributed by download<br>
or any form of electronic communications. An example of such a software object is<br>
shown in Fig. 3. In the example shown in Fig. 3, the software object is a virtual<br>
contact card or "vcard" 302. In this example, vcard 302 includes information such as<br>
a company name 304, the subscriber's name 306, the address 308, and instructions for<br>
initiating a call 310. In addition vcard 302 includes a field in which the recipient of<br>
the vcard is to enter their telephone number 312 and a software control 314, such as a<br>
button, that initiates the telephone call. The information provided, the company name<br>
304, the subscriber's name 306, the address 308, and instructions for initiating a call<br>
310, are merely examples and any desired information may be included in the vcard.<br>
Likewise, field 312 and software control 314 are merely examples of a software<br>
mechanism that may be used for operation of the vcard.<br>
Included in or associated with vcard 302 and/or software control 314 is<br>
software that initiates a telephone call between the subscriber and the recipient of the<br>
vcard. When the recipient enters a telephone number in field 312 and activates<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT7US2006/009450<br>
software control 314, vcard 302 generates a URL and uses the URL to transmit<br>
information 316 to a vcard server 318. While the transmitted information 316 may<br>
include the identification and password information of the subscriber, preferably,<br>
transmitted information 316 does not include this information in an insecure form.<br>
For example, transmitted information 316 may include the identification and<br>
password information of the subscriber in an encrypted form, or transmitted<br>
information 316 may be a token that is used by vcard server 318 to obtain the<br>
identification and password information of the subscriber, such as by a database<br>
lookup.<br>
Vcard server 318 receives the transmitted information 316 and generates a<br>
URL that is used to transmit information 320 to secure web server 106. This URL is<br>
similar to that generated by user computer system 102, shown in Fig. 1, which is used<br>
to communicate with secure web server 106. If the transmitted information 316 is<br>
encrypted identification and password information of the subscriber, vcard server<br>
318 decrypts the information and uses it to generate the URL. If the transmitted<br>
information 316 is a token, vcard server 318 validates the token, then uses the token<br>
to obtain the identification and password information of the subscriber, such as by<br>
using the token to access a database that contains the identification and password<br>
information of the subscriber. In any case, the URL is used to transmit information<br>
320 to secure web server 106, which initiated the telephone call in a manner similar to<br>
that shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Typically, vcard 302 includes information such as the network address of<br>
vcard server 318, token and/or encryption information, and information identifying<br>
the sender of the vcard. Alternatively, vcard 302 could include a unique token that<br>
identifies the particular call setup to be initiated, but which does not itself include<br>
information that identifies the subscriber account involved. Of course, various<br>
modifications are possible, such as including the identification information, but not<br>
the password, etc.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/101949	PCT/US2006/009450<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 3, vcard 302 included field 312 in which the<br>
recipient of the vcard entered the telephone number to which the telephone call was to<br>
be completed. Alternatively, the sender of the vcard or other software object could<br>
specify a particular number to which the telephone call is to be completed. This<br>
would allow a subscriber to control the particular calls that can be made. For<br>
example, the subscriber could generate one software object that initiated a call from<br>
their grandmother's phone to the subscriber's phone, another software object that<br>
initiated a call from a friend's phone to the subscriber's phone, etc. This allows<br>
parties to initiate calls to the subscriber from their phone at any time, while billing the<br>
subscriber, the "to" number.<br>
In addition, the sender of software object may be allowed to specify<br>
conditions for use of the software object. For example, the sender may specify that<br>
the software object expires after a particular date, the sender may specify time of day<br>
restrictions on the calls, the sender may restrict international calls, and the like. If the<br>
transmitted information is encrypted, this information may be included in the<br>
encrypted information. If the transmitted information is a token, the database may<br>
include the appropriate conditional information.<br>
Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been described,<br>
