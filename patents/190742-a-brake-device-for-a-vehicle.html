Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the actuator 12 has a casing 16 comprising a first case member 17 to which the motor 15 is attached, a second case member 18 joined to the first case member 17 on the side opposite the side on which the motor 15 is disposed, and a third case member 19 joined to the second case member 18 on the side opposite the side on which the second case member 18 is joined to the first case member 17.  The planetary gear mechanism 14 is con tained in a gear chamber 21 formed in the casing 16.  The transmission levers 10R and 10F in the intermediate parts of the first transmission system 6R and the second transmission system 6F are supported for turning in a lever chamber 22 defined by the third case member 19 and a cover 20 joined to the third case member 19.  The motor 15 is fastened to the first case member 17 of the casing 16 with its output shaft 23 extended in a gear chamber 21.<br>
[0 0 19]<br>
The planetary gear mechanism 14 comprises a sun gear 24, a ring gear 25, a plurality of planetary gears 26 in engagement with both the sun gear 24 and the ring gear 25, and a planet carrier 34 supporting the plurality of planet gears 26.

In the lever chamber 22, the transmission lever 10F is fixed to the end of the shaft 27, a sleeve 30 is mounted coaxially with the shaft 27 on a bearing 31 put on a part of the shaft 27 between the transmission lever 10F and the flange 27a.  The transmission lever 10R is fixed to the end<br>
of the sleeve 30 on the side of the lever chamber 22, and the ring gear 25 is fixed to the end of the sleeve 30 on the side of the gear chamber 21.  Thus, the transmission lever IOR is connected operatively through the sleeve 3 0 to the ring gear 25.  The ring gear 25 is spaced apart from the transmission lever 10R with a cylindrical spacer 32 coaxially put on the sleeve 30.

The planet carrier 34 is fixedly mounted on the flange 27a of the shaft 27 to which the transmission lever 10F is fixed.  Thus, the transmission lever 10F is connected operatively through the shaft 27 to the planet carrier 34.<br>
[0 0 2 3]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the damper 8R comprises a bottomed cylindrical member 36 having a bottom wall connected to the brake cable 7R, a shaft 37 coaxially inserted in the bottomed cylindrical member 3 6 and connected to a brake cable 9R, a bearing member 38 having the shape of a bottomed cylinder, having a bottom wall provided with a hole 38a through which the shaft is passed axially slidably, and slidably fitted in the bottomed cylindrical member 36, a seat plate 39 having the shape of a disk, provided with a hole 39a through which the shaft is passed axial]y slidably and fitted slidably in the bottomed cylindrical member 36, a damping spring 40 compressed between the bearing member 38 and the seat plate 39 within the bottomed cylindrical member 36, a retaining ring 41 put on the shaft 37 to limit the movement of the bearing member 38 away from the seat plate 39, a retaining ring 42 put on the shaft 37 to limit the movement of the seat plate 3 9<br>
away from the bearing member 38, and a housing 43 containing those components.  The brake cable 7R passed through one end of the housing 43 so as to be movable relative to the housing 43 and connected to the bottomed cylindrical member 36, the brake cable 9R is passed through<br>
the other end of the housing 43 so as to be movable relative to the housing 43 and connected to the shaft 37. The damping spring 40 is loaded so that the the damper 8R cannot be contracted by an ordinary brake operating force applied thereto by operating the first brake lever 5R.<br>
[0 0 2 4]<br>
The damper 8F is constructed similarly to the damper 8R and is interposed between the brake cables 7F and 9F.<br>
[0 0 2 5]<br>
The electronic control unit 13 receives detection signals from a brake operating force detector 44R for detecting brake operating force produced by operating the first brake lever 5R, a brake operating force detector 44F for detecting brake operating force produced by operating the second brake lever 5F, a wheel speed detector 45R for detecting the rotating speed of the rear wheel WR, and a<br>
wheel speed detector 45F for detecting the rotating speed of the front wheel WF.  The electronic control unit 13 controls the operation of the motor 15 on the basis of the detection signals provided by the detectors 44R, 44F, 45R and 45F in the following manner.<br>
[0 0 2 6]<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, when the first brake lever 5R is not operated and the second brake lever 5F is operated, the<br>
planet carrier 34 is turned in the direction of the arrow whereby the brake operating force is transmitted by the second transmission system 6F to the actuating lever 1F to apply the front brake BF.  When no poser is supplied to the motor 15, the rear brake BR remains inoperative because the sun gear 24 is free to rotate.  When the motor 15 is driven for rotation in the normal direction, the sun gear 24 turns in the direction of rotation of the planet carrier 34, so that the ring gear 25 turns in the reverse direction to apply the rear brake BR and the assisting force of the motor 15 acts additionally on the front brake BF.<br>
[0 0 2 7]<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the front brake BF produces a<br>
braking force corresponding to the sum of the brake operating force produced by operating the second brake lever 5F and the assisting force of the motor 15 and the rear brake BR produces' a braking force corresponding to the force produced by the motor 15.  Consequently, a total braking force represented by a vector A is produced.<br>
[0 0 2 8]<br>
In this case, when the reduction ratio of the ring gear 25 to the sun gear 24 is iR, the reduction ratio of the planet gears 26 to the sun gear 24 is iC, the number of teeth of the ring gear 25 is ZR, and the number of teeth of the sun gear is ZS, the inclination of the vector B<br>
representing the assisting force is expressed by:<br>
(0029)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The rear wheel braking force is expressed by (T x is x<br>
ZR/ZS) and the assisting force in the front wheel braking<br>
force is expressed by {T x is x (ZR + ZS)/ZS}, where T is<br>
the output torque of the motor 15, and is is the reduction<br>
ratio of the sun gear 24 to the motor 15.<br>
[0 0 3 0]<br>
A shaded region in Fig. 7 is an ideal braking force distribution region between allowable limit lines on the opposite sides of an ideal braking force distribution curve C that does not lock the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR when braked.  The output torque of the motor 15 is controlled on the basis of the brake operating force detected by the brake operating force detector 44F so that the final braking force P is as near to the ideal braking force distribution region as possible.<br>
[0 0 3 1]<br>
The output of the motor 15 may be controlled on the basis of the traveling speed of the motor scooter at the moment when the braking operation is executed instead of on the basis of the brake operating force so that the an assisting force as shown in Fig. 8 is produced.  When the output of the motor 15 is controlled in such a mode, linked braking force characteristics as indicated by broken lines in Fig. 9 are realized when the traveling speed is low, and linked braking force characteristics as indicated by a continuous line in Fig. 9 are realized when the traveling speed is high.<br>
[0 0 3 2]<br>
When the first brake lever 5R is operated for braking, the second brake lever 5F is not operated and the motor 15 is driven, the rear brake BR produces a braking force<br>
corresponding to the sum of the brake operating force produced by operating the first brake lever 5R and the assisting force of the motor 15 and the front brake BF<br>
produces a braking force corresponding to the assisting force of the motor 15 as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
[0 0 3 3]<br>
When it is decided, on the basis of the wheel speeds detected by the wheel speed detectors 45R and 45? when the<br>
braking operation is executed, that there is the high possibility that at least either the rear wheel WR or the front wheel WF is locked, the motor 15 is driven for rotation in a direction reverse to that in which the motor 15 is driven for cooperative braking to turn the sun gear 24 in the direction of the arrow as shown in Fig. 11. Consequently, the planet gears 2 6 rotates turning the ring gear 25 in the direction of the arrow, i.e., the direction for reducing the braking force of the rear brake BR, and<br>
the planet carrier 34 is turned in the direction of the<br>
arrow, i.e., the direction for reducing the braking force of the front brake BF, by the reaction force of the ring<br>
gear 25.  Consequently, the braking forces acting on the rear wheel WR and the front wheel WF are reduced to avoid locking the wheels WR and WF.  In this state, the planetary-gear mechanism 14 applies a pull to the dampers 8R and 8F cf the first transmission system 6R and the second transmission system 6F whereby the damping springs 40 are compressed.<br>
[0 0 3 4]<br>
The motor 15 is disconnected from the power supply to increase the braking force again in the antilock-braking control mode.  Then, as shown in Fig. 12, the damping spring 40 of the dampers 8R and 8F release the stored energ-. to increase the braking forces of the rear brake BR and the front brake BF.<br>
[0 0 3 5]<br>
Thus, the rear brake BR and the front brake BF are controlled for antilock-braking control by a single control system, in which control operations for converging, reducing and enhancing force is executed on the bar: is of<br>
slip factor distribution to the front wheel side and the rear wheel side.  The distribution of increasing or reducing force to the front wheel side and the rear wheel side is dependent on the reduction ratio of the planetary gear mechanism 14, and the connection of the first transmission system 6R, the second transmission system 6F<br>
and the motor 15 to the components of the planetary gear mechanism 14. . The control operation using the single control system is able to suppress the reduction of effect more effectively than the control using two control systems for individual control by properly determining the inclination 9 of the assisting force.<br>
[0 0 3 6]<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, when carrying out the antilock-braking control operation, a straight line L connecting predetermined slip factors XOF and XOR respectively for the front wheel side and the rear wheel side and representing a convergence level is set on a map to demarcate a reducing region above the straight line L and an enhancing region below the straight line L.  A reducing control operation is executed when a point specified by a front slip factor XF and a rear slip factor XR  is in the reducing region as<br>
indicated at D, and an enhancing control operation is executed when a point specified by a front slip factor X? and a rear slip factor XR  is in the enhancing region as indicated at E.  The direction of rotation and the angular displacement of the output shaft of the motor 15 are determined by the following procedure.  The length SX  of the perpendicular from the point D or E to the straight line L is calculated by using the following expression.<br>
[0 0 3 7]<br>
SA.  =    (AQR • A,f   +   AQF • A.R   —   AQF • AOR) / (AOR2   +   Aop2) 1/2<br>
The direction of rotation of the output shaft of the motor 15 is determined by using SX  &gt; 0 for the perpendicular from the point D to the straight line L and SX

The operation of the first embodiment will be described hereinafter.  Since the intermediate part of the first transmission system 6R capable of mechanically transmitting a brake operating force produced by operating the first brake lever 5R to the rear brake BR is connected<br>
to the ring gear 25 of the planetary gear mechanism 14, the intermediate part of the second transmission system 6F capable of mechanically transmitting a brake operating force produced by operating the second brake lever 5F to the front brake BF is connected to the planet carrier 34 supporting the planet gears 26 of the planetary gear mechanism 14, and the sun gear 24 of the planetary gear mechanism 14 is connected to the motor 15, either the rear brake BR or the front brake BF, for example, the front brake BF produces a braking force corresponding to the sum of the brake operating force and the assisting force of the motor 15 when either the first brake lever 5R or the second brake lever 5F, for example, the second brake lever 5F is operated, and, for example, the rear brake BR produces a braking force corresponding to the assisting force of the motor 15.<br>
[0 0 3 9]<br>
If there is the possibility that the front wheel is locked, the motor is driven in the direction reverse to, the direction for cooperative operation to reduce the braking forces of the rear brake BR and the front brake BF/ and the<br>
braking forces of the rear brake BR and the front brake BF can be enhanced again by driving the motor 15 in the direction for cooperative operation.  Thus, the antilock-braking control of both the rear brake BR and the front brake BF can be achieved by the single actuator 12 comprising the planetary gear mechanism 14 and the motor 15.<br>
[0 0 4 0]<br>
Since the dampers 8R and 8F are interposed between the first brake lever 5R and the part of the first transmission system 6R connected to the ring gear 25 of the planetary gear mechanism 14 and between the second brake lever 5F and the part of the second transmission system 6F connected to the planet carrier 34 of the planetary gear mechanism 14, the resilient energy stored in the dampers 8R and 8F can be used for enhancing the braking forces again in the antilock-braking control mode, and the direct action of the force produced by the actuator 12 on the first brake lever 5R or the second brake lever 5F can be avoided in the antilock-braking control mode to give satisfactory brake operating feeling.<br>
[0 0 4 1]<br>
The operation of the motor 15 is thus controlled by the electronic control unit 13 to achieve the cooperative actions of the rear brake BR and the front brake BF and the antilock-braking control operation, and the braking force can be distributed properly by selectively determining the gear ratios of the planetary gear mechanism 14 and, consequently, the reduction of the braking force, which is a problem in the integral control of the antilock-braking control operation, can be suppressed.  Consequently, the actuator 12 and the electronic control unit 13 can be combined in a simple single control system to reduce the cost and the weight of the brake system in a great measure and to enable the application of the brake system to a low-cost vehicle, such as a motor scooter.<br>

Referring to Fig. 15, the equalizer 46R comprises a<br>
holding member 51 connected to the brake cable 9R, a sprocket wheel 52 rotatably supported on the holding member 51, a chain 54 wound around the sprocket wheel 52, and<br>

[0 0 4 8]<br>
In the second embodiment, both the rear brake BR and the front brake BF produce braking forces when either the first brake lever 5R or the s'econd brake lever 5F is operated with the motor, not shown, connected to the sun gear 24 of the planetary gear mechanism 14 disconnected from the power supply. .Thus, both the rear brake BR and the front brake BF can be actuated in combination.<br>
[0 0 4 9]<br>
The antilock-braking control operation can be effected<br>
by actuating the sun gear 24 of the planetary gear mechanism 14 to reduce or enhance again the respective braking forces of the rear brake BR and the front brake Bf simultaneously by a manner similar to that carried out by the first embodiment.  Accordingly, the rear brake BR and the front brake BF can be controlled for antilock-braking control simply by adding the planetary gear mechanism 14 and the motor for applying force to the planetary gear mechanism 14 to a mechanical brake system capable of linked braking actions.<br>
