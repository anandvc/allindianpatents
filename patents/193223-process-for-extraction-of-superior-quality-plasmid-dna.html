FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of molecular biology and genetics. More particularly, the invention relates to methods used for DNA purification. The present invention is directed to a novel process for the extraction of superior quality plasmid DNA, a composition for DNA purification and a kit prepared in accordance with the said process.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Preparation of plasmid DNA from bacterial vectors on a small scale is a basic requirement in laboratories engaged in molecular biology research. Alkaline lysis of the bacterial cells is one of the common methods used for preparation of plasmid DNA from bacterial cultures. This is a very simple and rapid method wherein bacterial cells are lysed using SDS, chromosomal DNA, and the proteins are precipitated and removed by pheno[-chloroform extractions. The plasmid DNA is eventually recovered by precipitation using alcohols. However, various problems are associated with this process. For instance, the DNA extracted by this method is often crude and the quality is inadequate for subsequent molecular manipulations. Although phenol is efficient in denaturing proteins, mpDNA (mini-prep DNA) made by standard alkaline lysis has several impurities, especially proteins which are of bacterial origin. The residual protein impurities left in the plasmid DNA preparation inhibits subsequent enzyme manipulations. Additionally, the organic impurities associated with phenol oi chloroform preparations also inhibits enzyme digestion. Whenever mpDNA is extracted by the conventional alkaline lysis method, higher quantities of restriction enzymes are required for digestion. Further, with several not-so-good-cutters, it is often essential to perform a second round of phenol chloroform extraction of the DNA to ensure enzyme digestion. Another problem associated with the alkaline lysis method is that this method is time consuming. Good quality mpDNA could also be prepared using a number of commercial kits (Geneclean II, BIO 101; Ion-exchange resins, Qiagen elc). Although the quality of mpDNA extracted using these commercial kits is superior, the standard alkaline lysis protocol continues to be popular, as the cost of the kits are unaffordable for routine use. Commercial kits as well as several previous reports employed silica or silica derivatives<br><br>
as principal matrices for specific isolation of nucleic acids. The primary objective of several of these protocols, however, is to purify DNA fragments from agarose gel.<br>
PRIOR ART REFERENCES:-<br>
There are several other protocols that employ silica or its derivatives for extraction of plasmid DNA. The kits for these processes are expensive.<br>
For instance, Marko et al describe a procedure for "the large-scale isolation of highly purified plasmid DNA using alkaline extraction and binding to glass powder" in Analytical Biochemistry, 121 382-7(1982) wherein the source of silica is giass-powder, a different form of silica. The process employs chaotropic agents such as Na-perchlorate to facilitate DNA binding to silica. The said agent is expensive, chemically unstable, hazardous. SDS is sued for lysis of bacterial cells. This protocol is extremely complicated. It also uses a chaotropic ion (sodium perchlorate) instead of NaCl, which is expensive, hazardous and unstable. Bacterial cells are lysed by standard alkaline lysis method using SDS instead of Triton-XlOO.<br>
Boyle &amp; Lew in 'An inexpensive ahemative to glassmilk for DNA purification'. Trends in Genetics. U 8, 1995 describe another method wherein a chaotropic ion Nal (sodium iodide) was used instead of NaCl. Nal is unstable and relatively more expensive. They also used Gaimidine which is also a chaotropic ion. No mention is made of how the bacterial cells were lysed, hence they must have used the standard alkaline lysis method (using SDS instead of Triton X-100).<br>
Boom et al. in 'Rapid and simple method for purification of nucteic acids' J. Clinical Microbiology, 28 495-503 (1990), wherein SDS was used instead of Triton for the lysis of bacteria. The chaotropic ion Guanidine thiocyanate was used here for DNA binding to silica instead of NaCl.<br>
Carter and Milton 'An inexpensive and simple method for DNA purifications on silica particles'.   Nucteic Acids Research.   21  1044 (1993) used diatomaceous earth (different<br><br>
tprm of silica, also available from sigma and others commercially). Silica has much more binding capacity for DNA than diatoraaceous earth. In this process, SDS was used for lysis of the bacterial cells instead of Triton X-100. Also, guanidine thiocyanate, which is a chaotropic salt (unstable, expensive and hazardous) has been used instead of NaCl.<br><br>
U.S. Patem No.5,503,816 relates to a process for DNA purification using silicate<br>
compounds. The conventional processes are used for isolation of DNA, Chaotropes such<br>
as Sodium perchlorate and Nal are used along with NaCi, isopropanol, guanidine HCI.<br>
The process is not directed towards use of NaCl as main ingredient, which is mentioned<br>
as passing reference.<br>
Most commercial kits in the market use silica based derivatives.    Most of these are<br>
confidential or proprietary. All are expensive.  Hence, these cannot be used routinely in<br>
laboratories.<br>
Accordingly, in order to obviate the drawbacks of the said prior art processes, the<br>
applicants have developed a novel process for the extraction of superior quality plasmid<br>
DNA and a composition for DNA extraction in accordance with the said process.<br>

Bacterial cells transformed with pBC12/PL/SEAP were harvested from 1.5 ml of over-night cultures, Plasmid DNA was isolated by standard alkaline lysis method (lanes 1 and 2), or using a combination of 1% SDS in Solution-2 and siiica (lanes 3 and 4) or 4% Triton X-IOO in Solution -2 and silica (lanes 5 and 6). Following the addition of 150fil of 5 M potassium acetate and transfer to fresh vials, samples were incubated with (lanes 2, 4 and 6) or without (lanes 1, 3 and 5) RNAse-A at SeX for ! hr. One \\S. of RNAse-A (10 mg/ml) was added to SDS/silica and Triton/silica mpDNA preparations (lanes 2 and 4), whereas 25)J1 of the enzyme were added to alkaline lysis preparation (lane 6). Following the incubation, phenol-chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation were used to extract mpDNA by standard protocol (1). Plasmid DNA by the modified procedure was prepared as described in the protocol. Five fil (10%) of the mpDNA were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide-Figure 3: Comparison of the restriction enzyme patterns of mpDNA prepared by three different methods. Plasmid DNA was isolated from bacterial cells using three different protocols as described in the legend for figure 2- RNAse-A treated mpDNA preparations were restricted with several enzymes. Results with three representative enzymes are shown. Fivefil of mpDNA were incubated with 1.0 or 10 units (as shown at the top of the lanes) of the indicated enzyme at 37°C for one hour. Following the incubation, the samples were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Following restriction patterns were expected after successful enzyme-digestion: BamH 1 = 1,695 and 3,532 kb; Kpn 1 = linearization; Pst 1 = 1,687, 1,834 and 1,914 bp. M= 1 kb ladder (GibcoBRL).<br>

Several protocols employed silica for extracting DNA fragments from agarose gel. A block of gel containing the DNA fragment is dissolved in excess solution of a chaotropic salt and the DNA fragment is rescued from the solution using silica suspension. The potential of silica, however, has not been exploited for developing a similar inexpensive strategy for routine preparation of good quality mpDNA. At the outset the applicant wanted to develop an analogous approach to prepare mpDNA by combining the standard alkaline lysis method using 1% SDS and the silica matrix. Although mpDNA free of bacterial proteins or other impurities could be recovered by this method, the DNA was completely resistant to restriction (see below). The applicant reasoned that SDS being negatively charged could also bind the silica particles, persist through the washing steps and co-elute with the plasmid DNA. SDS could inhibit enzyme activities. To test for this possibility, the applicant replaced SDS with non-ionic detergents in Solution 2. Plasmid DNA obtained with 1% Triton X-100 or IGEPAL CA-630 was readily restricted with different enzymes while that of 1% SDS was not. Non-ionic detergents lacking a negative charge, probably do not interact with the silica particles and are removed during the washing step.<br>
Although 1% Triton X-100 could lyse the bacterial cells, the yield of mpDNA was considerably lower than that of 1% SDS, indicating incomplete lysis. SDS bemg an ionic detergent is very efficient in lysing bacteria! cells. To improve the level of lysis, The applicant tested gradually increasing concentrations of Triton X-IOO and compared with that of 1% SDS (Figure 1). Lysis by Triton X-100 up to 2% concentration appeared incomplete. In addition, the species of the mpDNA obtained at this concentration were different from those of 1% SDS; alkaline supercoiled DNA was the major species isolated. Triton X-!00 at 3% concentration or above completely lysed the bacterial cells. The pattern of DNA species obtained was also identical to that of SDS, with covalently closed DNA molecule being more abundant than the other forms (Figure 1). Based on<br><br>
these results The applicant used 4% Triton X-100 in the subsequent experiments. IGEPAL CA-630 also appeared to function equally efficient (results not shown). Using the triton/silica protocol, most of the plasmid DNA from the bacterial lysate could be isolated with 15 fil of silica suspension. Addition of fresh silica to bacterial lysate, already extracted once, or re-elution of silica particles, by adding fresh distilled water yielded insignificant quantities of additional mpDNA.<br>
One advantage of using the triton/silica protocol is that only trace levels of bacterial RNA are co-purified with the mpDNA (Figure 2, compare lane 1 with 5) obviating the need for RNAse treatment. Presence of this RNA did not interfere with restriction of the mpDNA using several enzymes. This RNA, however, could be readily eliminated by adding a few units of RNAse-A to the bacterial lysate (Figure 2, compare lanes 3 and 5 with 4 and 6, respectively). Plasmid DNA prepared by the standard alkaline lysis contained not only large quantities of bacterial RNA but also this RNA was partially resistant to enzyme digestion (Figure 2, lanes 1 and 2).<br>
In the standard alkaline lysis protocol, lysis of the bacteria is achieved with 1% SDS in Solution 2. In addition to dissolving the bacterial membrane, SDS would also denature and precipitate bacterial protein. Addition of potassium acetate to the lysate would neutralize sodium hydroxide and any residual SDS. The optimized protocol presented here is analogous to the standard alkaline lysis method so far as the lysis of the bacterial cells is concerned. Lysis in our protocol, however, is accomplished with Triton X-100, not SDS. Unlike SDS, Triton X-100 may not be capable of denaturing bacterial protein or chemically interacting with potassium acetate. Our strategy, however, deviates from the standard protocol in the manner the plasmid DNA is recovered from the bacterial lysate. The applicant employed silica matrix for efficient purification of the plasmid DNA from the bacterial lysate. Since silica demonstrates strong affinity for nucleic acids but not proteins, the possible presence of intact bacterial proteins and other impurities in the lysate may not be of concern. In the triton/silica protocol, chromosomal DNA is removed from the bacterial lysate by alkali-denaturation and precipitation whereas bacterial proteins and other impurities are eliminated during the washing steps.<br><br>
Binding of DNA to silica requires the presence of high salt concentration, Tlie applicant used sodium chloride rather than sodium iodide (Geneclean II. BIO lOl). guanidium thiocyanate (4). or sodium perchlorate (3) to facilitate DNA binding to silica. The applicant tested varying concentrations of sodium chloride ranging from 1 to 4 M and found that 2 M and above allow maximum binding (results not shown). Importantly, use of sodium chloride instead of a chaotropic salt to promote DNA binding to silica offers the advantage that sodium chloride is inexpensive and the solution is stable at room temperature. Moreover, when compared in parallel, sodium chloride co-eluted the least quantity of bacterial RNA than sodium iodide or guanidium thiocyanate (results not shown).<br>
Restriction enzymes vary in the efficiency to tolerate the levels of impurities present in the mpDNA preparations. While enzymes such as BamH I, Hind III and Bgl II are relatively tolerant to the presence of impurities, others such as Kpn I and Dra HI are often sensitive. It is important to ensure the quality of the DNA when such sensitive enzymes are used. To test for the quality of mpDNA isolated by the triton/silica method, the applicant used restriction analysis as a direct measure of purity. The applicant digested mpDNA with several restriction enzymes at two different concentrations of the enzyme. Plasmid DNAs isolated by standard alkaline lysis and 1% SDS/silica method were also included for comparison. Results obtained with three representative enzymes are shown (Figure-3). BamH I at 10 or 1 units readily restricted plasmid DNA isolated by standard alkaline lysis method. Pst 1 restricted this DNA only at higher enzyme concentration whereas, Kpn 1 failed to restrict at either concentration. Kpn I, however, digested the same DNA preparation following an additional phenol-chloroform extraction indicating that it is possibly the presence of bacterial protein impurities that inhibited this enzyme. Phenol used in these experiments was distilled to ensure the quality and frozen in aliquots at -gCC. It is unlikely that impurities present in phenol inhibited Kpn I digestion as the same DNA preparation was readily restricted by BamH I and several other enzymes. Although Kpn 1, in this particular experiment failed to restrict the mpDNA isolated by alkaline   lysis,   on   other  occasions,   the   applicant  observed  digestion.   Experimental<br><br>
variation in lestriciion paiiein is coniiuon with sensitive enzymes such as Kpn I when mpDNA is prepared wilh alkaline lysis cxtiaclion. iirespeclive of what enzyme used, all the enzymes, at both liic concentiations readily restricted mpDNA prepared by the Iritoii/silica method. The applicant used ten or more different enzymes in these experiments. Tritoa'silica extraction consistently and reproducibly yielded very high quality DNA that was digested by all the enzymes used. Plasmid DNA extracted by SDS/silica method, on the other hand, was not digested by any of the enzymes used (Figure 3). Reducing SDS concentration from 1% to 0.4% in soiulion-2, however, did not inhibit subsequent enzyme-restriction, if the concentration of SDS was made a limiting factor, 0.4% in this experiment, probably all the SDS was precipitated by potassium acetate leaving mpDNA free of residual SDS.<br>
The purity of mpDNA prepared by triton/silica was compared further with that of standard alkaline lysis method. Plasmid DNA preparations were incubated with serial ten-fold dilutions of two restriction enzymes (Figure 4). Plasmid DNA prepared by alkaline lysis was restricted with Hind lU and EcoR I at 10 and 1.0 units. Reducing the enzyme concentration ftiither resulted in failure of restriction. Plasmid DNA prepared by triton/silica method, on the other hand, was restricted at enzyme concentrations much lower; up to 0.1 and 0.01 unit with EcoR I and Hind III, respectively. Although EcoR I did not release the 801 bp fragment at 0.01 unit enzyme concentration, a condition which requires restriction at two different sites, much of the plasmid in this reaction was restricted at least at one site (Figure 4. last lane). This result provided evidence that mpDNA isolated by triton/silica method is of superior quality as compared to standard alkaline lysis. The applicant routinely use restriction enzymes at O.iunit concentration in our laboratory for plasmid digestion thus significantly reducing the consumption of these expensive enzymes. Plasniid DNA isolated by triton/silica method is also amenable for manipulation using other enzymes such as Klenow, T4-ligase and Taq- DNA polymerase. Although The applicant presented here results obtained with one strain of the bacterial host (DH5a) and one plasmid vector. The applicant obtained identical results with a few more bacterial hosts (XL-1 blue, DH-1 and DHlOp) and a variety of plasmids that varied in size.<br><br>
Tlie applicant repoiis here a simpie and reproducible protocol for small-scale isolation of plasmid DNA from bacterial hosts. This protocol is safer than the standard alkaline lysis method as it eliminates the need for organic reagents. Silica matrix used here is inexpensive and a 100 gm quantity is sufficient for a moderate size laboratory for a few years (approximately 50,000-55,000 individual mini-preps could be prepared). In addition, digestion of the plasmid preparation with RNAse is also not necessary. Elimination of organic extraction, ElNAse digestion and alcohol precipitation, combined together, not only renders this protocol very rapid but also highly economical. Using the triton/silica protocol it is possible to prepare mini-preps in half the time required for the standard alkaline lysis method. An added advantage of the modified protocol is that, the current protocol requires only two sets of plastic vials as opposed to four or more for standard alkaline lysis. Importantly, the quality of plasmid DNA isolated by this protocol is comparable to that of the commercial kits. This was analyzed by restriction digestion and spectrophotometry (results not shown). All the reagents used in this protocol are inexpensive and stable at room temperature. Using this protocol it is possible to prepare superior quality mpDNA in the laboratory on a routine basis without the need for a commercial kit, expensive/unstable/hazardous reagents or sophisticated equipment.<br>
The applicant believe that the tritorb'silica protocol presented here is the simplest and quickest of several protocols reported previously to prepare good quality mpDNA from bacterial cultures, with or without employing silica.<br>

The tube was left undisturbed at room temperature for 24 hours for the coarse silica particles to settle. Fine silica particles suspended in the top 43 ml were decanted and the volume was made up to 50 ml by adding fresh sterile distilled water. Contents were mixed and left for 5 hrs. Forty four ml of the supematant from the top were discarded, 60 i^l of concentrated HC! were added, contents mixed and autoclaved. Finally, the volume was made up to 50 ml with sterile distilled water, contents thoroughly mixed and the suspension stored in refrigerator in small aliquots. The washing procedure described above removed approximately 0.6 gm of fme silica. Fifteen |il of the final silica suspension (approximately 1.6 mg silica) were used per 1.5 ml bacterial culture as described in the protocol.<br>
Plasmid DNA extraction:<br>
The plasmid vector, pBC12/PL/SEAP, used in these experiments was a kind gift form Dr. Brian R. Cullen (9). Bacterial hosts were transformed by Calcium Chloride method as described (10). Single colonies were picked up from selection plates and grown over¬night in Luria-Bertani medium (1) at 37'C with shaking. Plasmid DNA was prepared by three different methods from 1.5 ml over-night bacterial cultures. Alkaline lysis was performed according to the standard protocol (I). The DNA pellet, followmg alcohol precipitation was dissolved in 50 pi of sterile distilled water or TE and stored at -20°C. A detailed protocol for preparing nijiDNA by the triton/silica procedure has been presented in the protocol. For extracting the mpDNA with SDS/silica, essentially the same protocol was employed except that Solulion-2 consists of 1% SDS instead of Triton X-100. Following the alcohol washes, DNA from the silica was eluted in 50 p.1 sterile distilled water or TE and stored at 4°C.<br>
Protocol: Preparation of mini-prep DNA bv the triton/silica method.<br>
1)  Harvest over-night grown bacterial culture in to 1,5 ml polypropylene vials. To the<br>
bacterial pellet add 100^1 of Solution-1 (50 mM glucose, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 10<br>
mM EDTA). Suspend the cells thoroughly.<br><br>
2)	To each sample add 200^1 of modified Solution-2 {0.2 N NaOH and 4% Triton X-100). Close the cap and invert the vial a few times. The contents become clear indicating lysis of the bacterial cells.<br>
3)	Add 150^1 of So!ution-3 (5 M Potassium acetate, pH 4.8), close the caps and mix contents thoroughly. Incubate the vials for 5 min at room temperature, spin in a micro-centrifuge at full speed for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to fresh vials.<br>
4)	To each vial add 450|.il of 5 M NaCl and mix. Add 15p,l of silica suspension (prepared as described in the materials and methods), close the cap and mix the contents with continuous agitation for ten minutes. Spin the vials at full speed for 10 seconds. Decant the supernatant.<br>
5)	Add 250|il of the wash solution (60% ethanol, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). Resuspend silica by vortexing or lapping. Spin and decant the wash solution. Repeat the washing a couple of times.<br>
6)	After the third wash, spin the silica pellet at full speed for 10 seconds and remove any traces of alcohol using a micropipette-tip. Leave the vials for 5 min at room temperature with caps open to allow residual alcohol evaporate.<br>
7)	Add 50|il of autoclaved distilled water or TE. Mix silica by gentle tapping and leave the vials for 5 min at 37°C. Spin at full speed for 10 seconds and collect the supernatant. Store the eluted DNA at 4°C.<br>
