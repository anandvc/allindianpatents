				<td>A SIMPLE, EFFICIENT, AND ACCELERATED METHOD FOR ENZYME-CATALYZED IN VITRO MODIFICATION AND SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEIC ACID USING MICROWAVE IRRADIATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a simple, efficient, and accelerated method for enzyme-catalyzed in vitro modification and synthesis of nucleic acid using uninterrupted and brief microwave irradiation at a frequency ranging between 2300 to 2500 MHz, with the power output ranging between 600 to 900 watts, and for a period ranging from 5 to 120 seconds; and further, an apparatus for using said method. Background Art<br>
Enzymatic reactions of nucleic acids are key to molecular biologists. The most commonly used enzymatic reactions in molecular biology are site specific cleavage, ligation, dephosphorylation, phosphorylation (kination) and in vitro DNA and RNA synthesis reactions. These reactions are carried out by different enzymes such as restriction endonuclease. ligase, phosphatase. kinase, DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase. These reaction products have a wide range of applications in molecular biology.<br>
The discovery of several restriction endonucleases (RENs) gave birth of modern biotechnology. These enzymes catalyze the sequence specific hydrolytic cleavage of double-stranded DNA by nicking in the opposite strands.<br>
Ligase is another important enzyme, which can modify the nucleic acids by the formation of phosphodiester bond between two compatible ends of double-stranded DNA and single-stranded nicks in DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybrid. [Engler, M.J. and Richardson, C.C. (1982) in The Enzymes (Boyer, P.D, ed) Vol.5, p.3, Academic Press, San Diego]. The products of DNA ligase catalyzed reactions are required for cloning and manipulation of gene.<br>
Phosphatase catalyzes the removal of terminal phosphate groups of nucleic acids [Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F. and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition. Cold Spring Harbor ! Moratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York] and is necessary to reduce the vector ground in cloning and end labeling with [y 32P] ATP.<br>
Polynucleotide kinase modifies the nucleic acids by transferring or exchanging the phosphate group from the gamma position of ATP to the 5' hydroxyl terminus of polynucleotides (double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA) and nucleoside 3'monophsphates fSambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F. and Maniatis. (1989) Molecular cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York].<br>
The template directed synthesis of DNA and RNA catalyzed by respective polymerase is routinely carried out in recombinant DNA research. The DNA template directed DNA synthesis is used in preparing radio labeled hybridization probes by nick translation [Rigby et al. (1977), J, Biol. Chem. 113: 237], end filling reactions for ligation and labeling of DNA fragments, second strand cDNA synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing etc.<br>
The RNA template directed DNA synthesis catalyzed by reverse transcriptase is required for the synthesis of cDNA and amplification of gene by RT-PCR. The DNA template directed RNA synthesis (transcription) is utilized for identification of RNA polymerase specific promoter, coupled transcription and translation reactions and making highly labeled RNA probes etc.<br>
Traditionally the reactions are carried out by incubating in water bath maintained at the optimum temperature at which the enzyme exhibits maximum activity. The incubation time is varied from minutes to hours depending on the particular enzyme and the substrate as well as their concentrations. Most of these reactions are often required to be carried out in series to achieve a particular objective, as the product (s) of one reaction is the substrate for the another. Even though most of these reactions take few minutes to hours the overall time consumed to complete a particular set of reaction is quite high. It is generally preferred to give longer reaction time to ensure the completion of reaction.<br>
Main drawback of the traditional procedures is the long reaction time and the molecular biologists have to spend much of their precious time to perform the time consuming experiments with these enzymes. One of the ways to make the enzyme-catalyzed reaction faster is either to activate the enzyme or the substrate or both. Organic reaction usually is accelerated by thermal heating, which is not always possible in case of enzymes as most of them are susceptible to heat inactivation. One<br>
of the alternate ways to accelerate a chemical or biological reaction is to use microwaves as energy source. In fact, the use of microwaves for accelerating the rate of organic reactions was known for a long time.<br>
In 1986, (iedbye et. al and Giguere et. al demonstrated that many organic reactions could he conducted very rapidly by microwave irradiation (Gedye. R.N. ei. al.. Tetrahedron Lett. (1986), 26. 279; Giguere. R.J et. al., Tetrahedron Lett. (1986), 27, 4945-4948]. Since then versatility of "Microwave- induced Organic Reactions Enhancement' (MORE) chemistry was being demonstrated by many authors in a variety of organic reactions such as catalytic hydrogenation, Diels-Alder reaction, free radical reaction, acylation, deacylation etc. [Bose.A.K, et al.. Res. Chem. Intermed. (1994) 20, 1-11; Bose.A.K et al.. J.Org. Chem. (1991) 56, 6968-6970: Nahar, P. Tetrahedron Lett. (1997), 38, 7253-7254]. Practically all these reactions were carried out in a domestic microwave oven, operating a! a frequency of 2450 MHz and maximum power output is around 700 watts. These ovens are usually have 10 different levels corresponding to the different power output, level ten having the maximum or highest power output whereas level one has lowest power output of the microwave oven. Although drastic reduction in time is the main advantage of microwave reactions, the selectivity or specificity of the reactions were also being reported [Nahar. P. Tetrahedron Lett. (1997), 38, 7253-7254].<br>
Microwave energy has also been used successfully for protein assay [Akins, Jr. et al.; U.S. patent nos. 5,403,747 and 5,478,748] and immunohistochemistry [Boon, M.E. et. al; Am. J. Clin. Pathol. (1989), Boon, M.E. et. al; In Microwave Cookbook of Pathology : Flic art of Microscopic Visualisation]. Hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate by microwave irradiation has also been studied [Jahngen, E.G.E. et.al. J.Org. Chem. (1990) 55, 3406-3409].<br>
The effect of microwave irradiation on biopolymers, especially on enzymes and DNA has been studied by several workers. However, there were contradictory reports on the effect of microwave irradiation on the biomolecules. In some cases, microwaves were used to inactivate brain enzymes of small laboratory animals [Galli Claudio and Racagni Giogio, Methods in enzymology, (1982) 86, 636-642]. However, Byus, C.V. et al., have found an increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity in cultured cells using microwave energy [Byus et al, Cancer Res. (1988) 48,4222-4226]. There are<br>
also reports where enhancement as well as repression of cellular enzymatic activity was observed (Dutta. S.K. and Verma. M. Current Scince (1989) 58. 58-63; Dutta. S.K. and Verma. M. Current Scince (1988) 57. 779-786]. Maleev. V.Ya. et. al could not find any effect of enhanced microwave absorbtion by DNA (Maleev. V.Ya et al. Biopolymers (1987) 26. 1965-1970). However, according to Narasimhan et al DNA molecule can exhibite single-strand break, double strand-break, localized strand separations etc when exposed to microwaves [Narasimhan, V. and Huh. W.K.; Biochem.International (1991) 25. 363-370].<br>
linhancement of enzymatic reactions for nucleic acid synthesis and modifications by microwaves is not reported earlier although the nucleic acid digestion by restriction enzymes was reported by Jhingan (U.S. Pat. No. 5.350,686). The author digested DNA by restriction enzyme using microwave energy at a lowest power level that is 10% of the out put power of 700 watt of a standard microwave oven. During the reaction author also used a series of intervals, in which microwave power is not applied to the reaction mixture. In this method the total reaction time for digestion reactions with most of the enzymes were between 6 to 15 minutes. However, some of me control samples of plasmid DNA when incubated at 37°C showed nearly complete digested products. From this experiment it is not clear how much microwave irradiation was responsible for the above enzymatic reactions as most of the reaction time enzyme did not get proper microwaves. It seems that the time has played a major role than the microwaves in these cases.<br>
The reported method (U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,686) for microwave mediated enzyme catalyzed modification of macromolecules has several drawbacks such as (1) time gain was not attractive. It may be possible to get comparable results for some of the restriction enzyme digestion reaction out side microwave oven in the same time at 37°C, (2) the procedure require a series of intervals in which microwave power is not applied to the reaction mixture, (3) there was no uniform condition for enzymatic reactions. In most of the cases author used different microwave exposure time for digestion reaction using restriction enzyme and (4) automation of the procedure will be not very effective due to (a) longer reaction time and (b) ununiformity of reaction conditions.<br>
The applicants in the present invention have overcome all the above drawbacks. For any reaction an optimum condition is required. Optimum thermal energy accelerates an enzymatic reaction, in mild condition (below optimum condition) the reaction slows whereas in drastic condition (above optimum condition) enzyme deactivates. The same is true tor reactions using microwave energy. If optimum conditions are not maintained enzymatic reactions may be spoiled or give incomplete reaction product. In the present invention, proper conditions were found most of, which are contrary to the reported method, or not known in the prior art.<br>
More over, enzymatic reaction by microwaves greatly depends on the composition of the reaction mixture apart from enzyme and the substrate. Buffer, its pH. salt concentration and other ingredients play a major role in enzymatic reactions, more particularly when it is done by microwaves. We have invented that in dilution buffer, containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, the restriction enzyme was inactivated when exposed to continuous microwaves at high power, even for a short period (15 seconds and above) whereas in conventional reaction at 37°C it remained active. Dilution buffer is recommended by the supplier for diluting the high concentration enzyme when required.<br>
Contrary to the work reported by Jhingan (U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,686), we have now invented that enzymatic modification of a biological macromolecule could be carried out at the highest power setting of a microwave oven operating at a frequency of 2450 MHz and a power of 700 watts. More over, we also found that there is no need of any break during the microwave mediated enzymatic reactions, which is again contrary to the above work.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a rapid and efficient method for enzymatic reactions to produce specific products of these enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are essential for analysis and manipulation of genes in molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology and other fields.<br>

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method that can be automated in a simple way for carrying out most of the enzymatic reactions used in biotechnology or molecular biology in a single instrument.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop a method involving irradiation that does not lead to adverse effect on the enzyme.<br>

TABLE -1<br>
Comparison between the prior art and the present invention and the advantages of the present invention over the prior art.<br><br>
(Table Removed)	<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the present invention comprises a rapid and efficient method for site specific cleavage, modification and in vitro synthesis of nucleic acids by microwave induced enzymatic reactions, namely restriction endonuclease digestion, ligation, dephosphorylation, phosphorylation (kination), in vitro DNA synthesis, reverse transcription and in vitro RNA synthesis. The procedure comprises subjecting the reaction mixture containing the enzyme and the substrate to microwave exposure in the microwave oven at its highest power output for a short period without any break.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the procedure results in a highly selective specific cleavage, modification and synthesis of nucleic acids in 5 to 120 seconds. All the reactions were carried out for different duration of microwave<br>
exposure time to find the optimum reaction time. The products produced by the respective enzyme on microwave irradiation of their reaction mixtures were identical to that produced by the conventional procedures carried out at optimum temperature (37"C or below) for 30 minutes to several hours. Control reactions carried out outside microwave oven for the same time (as used in microwave mediated reactions) were failed to give desired reaction products. The absence of non-specific DNA bands with or without enzyme showed that microwave neither induces nonspecific nuclease activity nor cause fragmentation of DNA by the invented reaction conditions.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention. Stability of Hindlll on microwave exposure for 0-130 seconds at highest power level (700 watts) was studied, it was observed that Hindlll in its dilution buffer containing 50% glycerol (v/v) was found to loose its activity when irradiated for 0-130 seconds at 700watts.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, In contrast, the same enzyme (Hindlll) in its digestion buffer (overall glycerol content of the reaction mixture was 6.25% v/v) was found to be stable when exposed to microwaves for 0-130 seconds at 700watts (example 1, fig. 1).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, we have found that restriction endonuclease digestion can be carried out by the invented procedure that is by continuous microwave exposure to the reaction mixture for a short time without any break at the highest power level. This is in contrary to the reported method where enzyme was found to loose its activity at high power level.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the procedure resulted in a highly selective digestion of nucleic acids with high specificity (digested DNA were religatable) in considerable less time. Endonuclease activities of the restriction enzymes such as BamHI, EcoRI, Hindlll, Haelll, Bglll, PstI and BstEII were enhanced when the reaction mixture containing substrate DNA, enzyme and compatible buffer were exposed to microwaves at the highest power level. In a typical experiment, in 20 u.1 reaction volume out of lambda DNA was digested completely by 5-20 units (as defined by ; England Biolabs) of each restriction enzyme when exposed to microwaves for 30-70 seconds (example 2, fig. 2). The<br>
double digestion of the substrate DNA with two enzymes such as EcoRI and Hind III were also found to be completed within the same time when exposed to microwaves. Another advantage of the restriction endonuclease digestion by the invented procedure is that the method is quite uniform over a wide range of restriction cndonucieases as well as substrate DNAs. Substrate DNA includes lambda phage, baculovirurs. plasmid. plant and mammalian. The site-specific cleavage of substrate DNA by the restriction enzymes following the invented procedure was verified by ligation reactions carried out by the invented and conventional procedures.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, staggered cut DNA fragments produced by Hind III and blunt ended DNA fragments produced by Hae 111 were ligated completely by T4 DNA ligase in 10 to 15 seconds by microwave irradiation. Control experiment is carried out at 16°C for 8 hours as per conventional procedure.<br>
in still another embodiment of the present invention, restriction endonuclease produced DNA fragments (generated by conventional and invented procedures) were used as the substrate for ligation reactions and the ligated DNAs generated the same specific fragments when subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion with the same enzyme again (example 3, fig. 3).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, modified nucleic acids namely dephosphorylated, phosphorylated and ligated DNAs are important tools in molecular biology. All these products were obtained in sufficient quantities within 10-60 seconds of microwave exposure of the reaction mixture, a remarkable reduction in reaction time in comparison to conventional procedure. Thus, dephosphorylation of terminal phosphate groups of restriction endonuclease generated DNA fragments was carried out using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) in the microwave oven for different duration of time ranging from 20-50 seconds. The microwave mediated reaction products (dephosphorylated DNA) were verified when it failed to ligate by T4 DNA ligase but was kinasable by T4 polynucleotide kinase (example 4). Dephosphorylated restriction endonuclease cleaved DNA fragments were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (TPNK) and [y '" P] ATP in the microwave oven within 10 to 50 seconds. Phosphorylation of DNA is estimated by both trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts and autoradiography. The extent of P:, \sphorylation obtained in 30 seconds ,r,.crowave reaction is equal to that o; lined in the conventional reaction carried out at 37°C for 20 minutes (example 5).<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, synthetic oligonucleotides were also used as a substrate for kination reaction and later dephosphorylation reaction in the microwave oven. Both the reactions were found to occur with same efficiency as in the case of nucleic acid (example 5 b. Fig. 4).<br>
(n still another embodiment of the present invention, the enzyme-catalyzed in vilru syntheses in the invented procedure include DNA template directed DNA and RNA syntnesis and RNA template directed DNA synthesis (reverse transcription).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention. DNA dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by E.coli DNA polymerase I was carried out by microwave irradiation using nicked DNA template (nick translation) and staggered cut restriction cndonuclease fragments having 3' recessed ends as templates. Nick translation reactions were carried out in the microwave oven for different duration of time. DNA synthesis was monitored by incorporation of [ctj2P] dCTP in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitable counts. The TCA precipitable counts per microgram of nicked DNA in 45 seconds microwave reaction was found to be same as that of conventional reaction, carried out at 16°C for 60 minutes. However, that obtained in 30 seconds microwave reaction was found to be less whereas in 60 seconds it gave better result than the conventional reaction (example 6).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the fidelity of DNA synthesized in nick translation reaction by the invented procedure was further verified by Southern hybridization with template DNA (un-nicked). Blunt ended DNA was produced in 20 seconds when the reaction mixture containing Klenow fragment of E. coli. DNA polymerase 1 and DNA templates having 3'recessed end is exposed to microwaves. The extent of DNA synthesis in 20 seconds microwave irradiation was found to be same as in the control experiment carried out at 37°C for 30 minutes. Microwave exposure for less time shows incomplete result whereas higher time shows same or little better results. The DNA synthesized under the microwaves were ascertained by (i) incorporation of [a 32 P] dCTP, (ii) autoradiography and (iii) ligation to blunt ended vector DNA (example 7; fig. 5, lane 1).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, catalytic activities of RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase were also found to accelerate under the<br>
influence of microwaves. Thus. RNA directed DNA (cDNA) synthesis catalyzed by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) was carried out with two template RNAs and template specific primers by microwave irradiation in different time. Hie optimum exposure time was found 50 seconds, which gave the same amount ot synthesis as in the control reaction, carried out by the conventional procedure at 48°C for 45 minutes. The appreciable extent of reaction occurred even in 10 seconds of microwave exposure. Synthesis of cDNAs was monitored after amplification by Tfl polymerase in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (example 8, fig. 6 and example 9. fig. 7).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention. DNA directed RNA synthesis (transcription) requires specific DNA sequence (promoter) for binding of RNA polymerase to template DNA to initiate transcription. The in vitro synthesis of RNA catalyzed by T7 RNA polymerases were carried out using pSPT 18 and pSPT 19- neo DNA templates respectively (Boehringer Mannheim Germany, Cat No. 999644). Products obtained by microwave irradiation of the reaction mixtures for different time period ranging from 5-20 seconds were assayed by [a J^P] DTP incorporation and the synthesis of the transcript of specific size. Trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts obtained in 5 seconds microwave reaction was found to be almost equal to that obtained in conventional reaction carried out at 37°C for 20 minutes.<br>
In still another embodiment-of the present invention, all the reactions were carried out in domestic microwave oven (BPL, India), operating at a frequency of around 2450 MHz with a maximum power out put of around 700w. All the reactions were conducted in the microwave oven at the highest power setting (level 10), that means the magnetron duty cycle of 100% of the out put power of 700watts.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, reactions were set up by sequential mixing of buffer, substrate (s) and enzyme in definite volume as followed in the conventional protocol. In still another embodiment of the present invention, all these enzyme- catalyzed reactions were carried out in the pH and the ionic environment that were used in the conventional reactions. Reaction mixture was taken in the eppendorf tube and was placed at the center of the rotating disk of the microwave oven, Reaction mixture was exposed to microwaves for a period<br>
preferably of 5-120 seconds. During the microwave irradiation the eppendorf tube was kept uncapped. Reactions were stopped immediately after the microwave irradiation was over by adding ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA. pH 8.0) and /or heating at 75°C for 3-15 minutes. The reaction products were analyzed by conventional procedures such as agarose gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitable counts, ligation, kination, hybridization, and transformation. The results of all the reactions done by the invented procedures were compared with that obtained in the conventional reaction carried out by incubating the reaction mixture in the water bath kept at temperature optima of the enzyme.<br>
The present invention is a distinct instance of improvement for the site specific cleavage, modification and synthesis of nucleic acids over the existing methods known till date.<br>
