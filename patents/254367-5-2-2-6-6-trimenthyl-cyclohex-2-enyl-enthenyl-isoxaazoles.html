FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to 5-[2-(2,6,6-Trimethyl-cyclohex-2-enyl)-ethenyl]-isoxaazoles. This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5-[2-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohex-2-enyl)-ethenyl]-isoxaazole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives. This invention further relates to the preparation of compounds useful as antileishmanial agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Leishmaniasis is an infection caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania presenting several forms of the disease such as cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (MCL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which can be fatal when untreated. The currently available chemotherapy for leishmaniasis is far from satisfactory. For the treatment of both visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) pentavalent antimonials is recommended for &gt; 50 years, has shown resistance all over India. Some of the new drugs come up in recent years for the treatment of VL including amphotericin B lipid complex and the oral drug miltefosine [S. L. Croft, K. Seifert, M. Duchene, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. (2003), 126, 165], have other problems in the treatment.<br>
In recent years, efforts are being made to search for new molecules from the natural sources and in this endeavour diaryl heptanoids, oxygenated abietanes, diterpene quinones are showing promise as new lead molecules. Randomly designed heterocyclic ionone like molecules [Anzaldi M., Sottofattori E., Rizzetto R, di Casaleto B. G., Balbi A., Eur. J. Med. Chem. (1999), 34, 837] and some novel terpenyl 2, 4-diamino pyrimidines [Rosowsky A., Papoulis A. T., Queener S. F., J. Heterocyclic Chem.(1999), 36 723] are showing promising antimicrobial and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitory activities. Rationally designed 2, 4-diaminopyrimidines and some computer aided molecules are also giving further inputs in the leishmanial dihydrofolate reductase activity. In continuation of our studies on terpenyl pyrimidines as novel antileishmanial agents [Pandey S, Suryawanshi S. N., Gupta S, Srivastava V. M. L., Eur. J. Med. Chem. (2004), 39, 969], we have designed novel terpenyl Isooxazoles for their in-vivo antileishmanial activity.<br>

vacuo. To the crude obtained was added p- chloroaniline (0.381 gm, 3 mmol) in CH2C12 (10 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. After completion, it was concentrated in- vacuo and the extract was taken in CH2C12 (20 ml) followed by washing with H2O (2 x 15 ml), brine (2 x 15 ml) dried (Na2SO4) and it was concentrated in- vacuo. The crude product thus obtained was column chromatographed (SiO2, 60-120 mesh). Elution with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane furnished 4 as a white crystalline compound (0.49 gm, 90 %).<br>
Example 15<br>
5-[2-(2,6,6-Trimethyl-cycIohex-2-enyl)-ethenyl]-isoxazole-3-carboxylic	acid<br>
cyclohexyl-amide 4<br>
To a solution of 4(X = OH) (0.40 gm, 1.50 mmol) in CH2C12 (10 ml) was added oxallyl chloride (0.40 ml, 3.14 mmol) drop wise and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. Excess of oxallyl chloride was removed in-vacuo. To the crude obtained was added cyclohexylamine (0.297 ml, 3 mmol) in CH2C12 (10 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. After completion, it was concentrated in- vacuo and the extract was taken in CH2C12 (20 ml) followed by washing with H2O (2 x 15 ml), brine (2 x 15 ml) dried (Na2SO4) and it was concentrated in- vacuo. The crude product thus obtained was column chromatographed (SiO2, 60-120 mesh). Elution with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane furnished 4 as a white crystalline compound (0.36 gm, 70%).<br>
Example 16 Antileishmanial activity:<br>
The in- vivo leishmanicidal activity of the compounds were tested in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected with WHO reference strain of Leishmania Donovani (MHOM/IN/80/Dd8 strain [Gupta S., Tewari S., Bhaduri A. P., Jain G. K.,Acta Tropica, (2002), 84, 165]. Male hamsters weighing 45- 50 g were infected intracordially with 1X 107 amastigotes and the intensity of infection was assessed on day 20-25 post infection (p.i.) by spleen biopsy. Hamsters showing 5-15 amastigotes per 100 spleen cell nuclei were used for chemotherapeutic trials. The infected animals were randomized into several groups on the basis of their parasitic burdens. Usually 4-6 hamsters were used for each compound and the same numbers were kept as untreated controls. Drug treatment by intraperitoneal route was initiated after 2 days<br>
of biopsy and continued for 5 consecutive days at 50 mg/kg dose. Post treated biopsy was done on day 7 of the last drug administration and amastigotes counts were assessed by Giemsa stanning. The percentage inhibition in amastigotes multiplication was calculated using the following formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
P.I. = Percent inhibition of amastigotes multiplication ANAT = Actual number of amastigotes in treated animals INAT = Initial number of amastigotes in treated animals, and TIUC = Times increase of parasites in untreated control animals.<br>
The compounds synthesized were tested in Leishmania donovani in hamster model at 50 mg/kg dose as shown in Table-1. The parent compound terpenyl isooxazole 3 showed 76% inhibition at 50 mg/kg. This initial promising result prompted us to generate a chemical library of compounds of general formula 4 as shown in Table- 1.<br>
