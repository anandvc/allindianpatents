Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The compounds of formula I and E2020 can be prepared as described in the following reaction schemes and discussion. Unless otherwise indicated, compounds of the formulae I, II and III, VI and VII and the groups R1, R2 and R3 in the reaction schemes and discussion that follow are as defined above.<br>
SCHEME 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
 SCHEME 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 1 refers to the process of preparing a compound of formula I, which can be converted to a compound of the formula VII, E2020, by the methods of Scheme 2.<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, the compound of the formula IV is commercially available. Compounds of the formula V are also commercially available or can be prepared by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. United States Patent Application 08/329,352, filed October 26, 1994, also refers to the preparation of compounds of the formula V.<br>
A compound of the formula III can be prepared from a compound of the formula IV by reacting said compound of the formula IV with a compound of the formula V, wherein R1 is R2O(C=O)- or R3(C=O)-, R2 is (C1-C4)alkyl, and R3 is (C1-C4)alkyl or phenyl optionally substituted with from one to three substituents independently selected from (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C4)alkoxy, halo ortrifluoromethyl, in the presence of a Lewis acid in a reaction inert solvent. Preferably, R1 is R2O(C=O)-, and R2 is methyl. Suitable Lewis acids include aluminum trichloride, titanium tetrachlonde or boron trichloride, preferably aluminum trichloride. Suitable reaction inert solvents include methylene chloride or dichloroethane, preferably methylene chloride. The reaction is generally performed at a temperature from about 0°C to about 85°C, preferably about 30°C.<br>
A compound of the formula II can be prepared from a compound of the formula III by reacting said compound of the formula III with a methenylation agent. Preferably, R1 is R2O(C=O)-, and R2 is methyl. Suitable methenylation agents include tetramethyldiaminomethane in acetic anhydride, formaldehyde (about 37 weight % in water) in diethylamine, formaldehyde (about 37 weight % in water) in piperidine or N-methylthiomethylpiperdine. Preferably the methenylation agent is tetramethyldiaminomethane in acetic anhydride. When tetramethyldiaminomethane in acetic anhydride is the methenylation agent it is preferable to perform the reaction with an excess of tetramethyldiaminomethane and acetic anhydride. Most preferably, the reaction is performed with 4 equivalents of acetic anhydride (relative to the amount of the compound of formula III) and 2 equivalents of tetramethyldiaminomethane (relative to the amount of the compound of formula III). When the methenylation agent is other than tetramethyldiaminomethane in acetic anhydride a solvent may be used to facilitate the reaction. Suitable solvents include acetic anhydride, ethers (e.g.. diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran), methanol, acetic acid or dioxane, preferably acetic anhydride. The<br>
reaction is performed at a temperature from about 0°C to about 90°C, preferably at about 90°C. The reaction time may vary from about 6 hours to about 30 hours. Preferably the reaction time is about 12 hours.<br>
A compound of the formula I can be prepared from a compound of the formula II by reacting said compound of the formula II with a strong acid in a reaction inert solvent. Suitable strong acids include concentrated sulfuric acid, aluminum trichloride or concentrated hydrochloric acid, preferably concentrated sulfuric acid. When aluminum trichloride is the acid, a solvent must be used. Suitable solvents include carbon disulfide, methylene chloride ordichloroethane, preferably carbon disulfide. The reaction is performed at a temperature from about 0°C to about 100°C, preferably at about 25°C.<br>
Scheme 2 refers to the conversion of compounds of the formula I into E2020, the compound of the formula VII.<br>
Referring to Scheme 2, a compound of the formula I can be converted into a compound of the formula VI by reaction with a strong base in the presence of a solvent. Preferably, the reactant is a compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is R2O(C=O)-, and R2 is methyl. Suitable bases include potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, preferably potassium hydroxide. Suitable solvents include lower alcohols, water or mixtures thereof, preferably a 2:1 water/methanol mixture. The reaction is performed at a temperature from about 25°C to about 100°C preferably at about 100°C. The reaction time may vary from about 6 to about 24 hours, preferably about 18 hours.<br>
The compound of formula I is most preferably converted into a compound of formula VI by isolating the compound of formula I before converting it into the compound of formula VI. A compound of formula I is isolated by pouring the acidic solution containing the compound of formula I over an ice/water mixture and extracting the aqueous with an organic solvent. Suitable solvents include methylene chloride, ethyl acetate or dichlorothane, preferably methylene chloride. The organic layer can be concentrated and is then suitable for treatment with a strong base.<br>
A compound of the formula VII can be prepared from a compound of the formula VI by reacting said compound of the formula VI with a benzyl halide in a reaction inert solvent. Suitable halides include chloride, bromide, and iodide, preferably bromide. Suitable reaction inert solvents include diethyl ether, isopropyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, preferably isopropyl ether. The reaction is performed at a temperature from about 0°C to about 70°C, preferably about 70°C.<br>
The compound of formula VII can be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compound of the formula VII. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compound of formula VII are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, e.g.. salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate and pamoate [e.g.. 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts.<br>
The compound of the formula VII is basic in nature and is therefore capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the formula VII from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol orethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained.<br>
Compounds of the formula VII, E2020, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used to treat a disease caused by acetylcholinesterase activity, such as Alzheimers' Disease, according to the methods described in United States Patent 4,895,841, issued January 23, 1990.<br>
Specifically, United States Patent 4,895,841 states that the in vitro acetyl cholinesterase activity of 1-benzyl-4-((5,6-diethyoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methyl piperidine, E2020, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be determined according to the method of Ellman et al. Biochem. Pharmacol.. 7, 88-95 (1961).<br>
The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of 1-benzyl-4-((5,6-diethyoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methyl piperidine, determined according to the method of Ellman et aL, expressed in terms of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 0.0053 //M.<br>
Other methods for determining the activity of 1-benzyl-4-((5,6-diethyoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methyl piperidine are described in United States Patent 4,895,841, issued January 23, 1990.<br>
1-Benzyl-4-((5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methylpiperidine is effective for treatment, prevention, remission, improvement, etc. of various kinds of senile dementia, particularly senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type; cerebrovascular disease accompanying cerebral apoplexy, e.g. cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarcts, cerebral arteriosclerosis, head injury, etc.; and aprosexia, disturbance of speech, hypobulia, emotional changes, recent memory disturbance, hallucinatory-paranoid syndrome, behavioral changes, etc. accompanying encephalitis, cerebral palsy, etc.<br>
Further, 1-benzyl-4-((5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methylpiperidine has a strong and highly selective anticholinesterase action, which also renders the compound useful as a pharmaceutical based on this mode of action.<br>
Specifically, 1 -benzyl-4-((5,6-dimethoxy-1 -indanon)-2yl)methyl-piperidine is effective for, for example, Huntington's chorea, Pick's disease and delayed ataxia or tardive dyskinesia other than senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.<br>
When 1-benzyl-4-((5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanon)-2yl)methylpiperidine is used as a pharmaceutical for these diseases, it may be orally or parenterally administered. In general, it is parenterally administered in the form of injections, such as intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular injections, suppositories, or sublingual tablets. The dose will vary depending upon the symptom; age, sex, weight, and sensitivity of patients; method of administration; time and intervals of administration and properties, dispensing, and kind of pharmaceutical preparations so that there is no particular limitation with respect to the dose. Normally the compound may be administered in a dose of about 0.1 to 300 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, per day per adult, ordinarily in one to four portions.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations in the dosage form of, e.g., injections, suppositories, sublingual tablets, tablets, and capsules are prepared according to methods which are commonly accepted in the art.<br>
In preparing injections, the effective ingredient is blended, if necessary, with a pH modifier, a buffer, a suspending agent, a solubilizing agent, a stabilizer, a tonicity agent, a preservative, etc., followed by preparation of an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection according to an ordinary method. In this case, if necessary, it is possible to lyophilize these preparations according to an ordinary method.<br>
Examples of the suspending agents include methylcellulose, Polysorbate 80®, hydroxyethylcellulose, acacis, powdered tragacanth, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate.<br>
Examples of the solubilizing agent include polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil, Polysorbate 80®, nicotinamide, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, Macrogol®, and an ethyl ester of castor oil fatty acid.<br>

The slurry was stirred overnight, at 70°C, at which time high pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the starting material was mostly consumed. The reaction mixture was then filtered to remove precipitated triethanolamine hydrobromide. To the remaining solution was added ether saturated with hydrochloric acid (1.0 ml, 12 mmol), and the solvent was removed in vacua. The residue was dissolved in 20 ml of hot isopropanol and allowed to cool to room temperature. The precipitated solid was filtered to provide 1.60 gm (61%) of the title compound as a white solid.<br>
