				<td>RADIATION CURABLE CONDUCTIVE INK AND MANUFACTURING<br>
METHOD FOR USING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation curable conductive ink<br>
and manufacturing method for conductive substrate using conductive<br>
ink, which is particularly applicable for use in electronic materials,<br>
including radio frequency identification (RFID) antenna, printed-circuit<br>
boards, smart cards (non-contact chip cards) components, smart labels,<br>
printed electronics, anti-electromagnetic interference (EMI) and anti-<br>
electrostatic materials.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
The driving force of technological progress has accentuated<br>
multifunctionality and continuous miniaturization in the design of various<br>
electronic products. More particularly, rapid development in networking<br>
and wireless communication in recent years has seen the perpetual<br>
modification in a diverse range of portable electronic products, which<br>
has altered the unlimited potentiality of 21st century modes of business.<br>
There is an inseparable relationship between advancement in the<br><br><br>
miniaturization of electronic products and electronic materials, for<br>
instance, laminate type antenna are replacing traditional stem antenna,<br>
and the lamination of printeo-circuit boards has made miniature cellular<br>
phones available to the market. Moreover, rapid growth in radio<br>
frequency Identification (RFID) in recent years has seen the application<br>
of RFID in electronic money, animal chip readers, smart cards (non-<br>
contact chip cards), smart store shopping, and so on, which have<br>
already become an intimate part of the lives of consumers.<br>
Although lamination of the aforementioned laminate type antenna,<br>
printed-circuit boards and radio frequency identification systems offer<br>
convenience of use, however, the current cost of manufacture is still<br>
very high, with the result that many innovative products or new modes<br>
of business are still speculative and non-viable.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, which shows an example of the radio frequency<br>
identification (RFID) applied in a smart card (non-contact chip card), the<br>
principle of which involves the transmission of signals from a chip 11 on<br>
a smart card 10 to a reader 20 through a laminated antenna 12. An<br>
antenna 21 of the reader 20 then receives the signals, and a<br>
microprocessor 22 decodes the signals to form readable information.<br>
Furthermore, the reader 20 can also deliver other data to the smart card<br><br><br>
10, whereupon the chip 11 on the smart card 10 proceeds with writing<br>
operations. Because the transmission method implemented is an<br>
inductive type (using a coil resonance producing high frequency signal<br>
induction), thus, a power supply does not need to be installed in the<br>
smart card 10.<br>
In principle, the aforementioned transmitting terminal of the radio<br>
frequency identification can be configured on any type of inexpensive<br>
product, and can even altogether replace current bar codes as used on<br>
all types of commodities, thus bringing infinite convenience and<br>
completely changing current lifestyle trends.<br>
However, current technology is still unable to overcome the problem<br>
of the high cost of radio frequency identification systems, primarily<br>
because of the high cost of the aforementioned antenna compared,<br>
which can cost higher than the chips.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, which shows the aforementioned antenna 12 of<br>
the smart card 10 primarily structured by disposing a wound coil on a<br>
laminated substrate 13, thereby forming the antenna 12 that is able to<br>
transmit and receive signals. A traditional etching method is used to<br>
dispose the wound coil onto the laminated substrate 13. However, even<br>
mass production is unable to reduce costs because of complications in<br><br><br>
the job program.<br>
Hence, working procedure can be effectively reduced and savings on<br>
costs made if a screen printing method is used to directly mount the<br>
wound coil onto the laminated substrate. Even though current<br>
technology has enabled the universal adoption of screen printing in the<br>
manufacture of circuit substrate, however, the current primary use of<br>
traditional thermal curable conductive ink containing pure silver powder<br>
is unable to effectively reduce manufacturing costs when used on the<br>
aforementioned radio frequency identification antenna or circuit board.<br>
Accordingly, the inventor of the present invention has developed a<br>
radiation curable conductive ink and a manufacturing method for<br>
conductive substrate using the conductive ink that effectively reduces<br>
manufacturing costs.<br>
