				<td>Antioxidative Vitamin B6 Analogs Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel antioxidative vitamin B6 analogs and their use in the cosmetic, dermatological, pharmaceutical and/or nutritional fields.<br>
Background<br>
Skin is subject to insults by many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include ultraviolet radiation (e.g., from sun exposure), environmental pollution, wind, heat, low humidity, harsh surfactants, abrasives, and the like. Intrinsic factors include chronological aging and other biochemical changes from within the skin. Whether extrinsic or intrinsic, these factors result in visible signs of skin aging and environmental damage, such as wrinkling and other forms of roughness (including increased pore size, flaking and skin lines), and other histological changes associated with skin aging or damage.<br>
In recqnt years, intrinsic factors contributing to the premature aging of skin have been investigated. Substances having anti-oxidizing activity, those having an activity of scavenging reactive oxygen species or radicals, or an activity of inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of a metal ion (Fenton reaction) have attracted attention, because reactive oxygen species or radicals are responsible for a variety of diseases as well as the aging of skin such as hardening, development of wrinkles and pigmentation, and the generation of reacrive oxygen species in the presence of metal ion causes the oxidative disorders in the body which are responsible for a variety of diseases and the aging of skin described above.<br><br>
Additionally, free radicals also have been associated with the development of tumors, it in believed that free radicate damage DMA and change the normal cells into potential tumor celle.<br>
One effort to reduce the signs of aging that has received attention in recent years in the use of alpha-hydroxy adds (AHAs). Products with AHAs are marketed for a variety of purposes: to smooth line lines and surface wrinkles, to improve skin texture and tone, to unblock and cleanse pores, to improve oily skin or acne, and to improve skin condition in general. Cosmetics that contain AHAs have become widely used in recent years despite many unanswered Questions about their safety. Recently, a study sponsored by the cosmetics industry indcates that these products may mate users more sensitive to sunlight and especially to the ultraviolet (UV) radiation component of sunlight. UV exposure can damage the skin and at high doses, especialy over a Jong period, can cause skin carrier. Thus, it would be advantageous, for example, for cosmetics containing alpha-hydroxy adds to contain a UV protoctant<br>
WO 89/57124 relates to new monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric derivatives of biomolecules, which are derived e.g. from the group of vitamin B6 and/or vitamin A and/or other biomolecules, methods of their production and their use, especially for pharmaceutical and analytical purposes.<br>
WO 98/20013 relates to new knoevenagel condensation products, the method for their production and their use, specially for pharmaceutical and analytical purposes.<br><br>
2A<br>
EP 0749982 relates to grafted polysaccharide compositions comprising potysaccharides grafted with antioxidants on at least one hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide as a treatment for arthritis, as it drug delivery vehicle, to reduce the Incidence of post-operative adhesion formation, to promote the healing of chronic wounds and ulcers, and as a component of cosmetic formulations.<br>
Patient compliance refers to the extent to which actual behavior of a patient coincides with medical advice. Approximately two-thirds of patients do not follow their doctor's advice. Some of the reasons for not talcing the mediation as prescribed are complexity of drug regimen, embarrassment, e.g., children who need to take medications at school, and forgetfulness. Thus, an easy method of treatment of diseases would be desirable.<br>
Thus, ft would be desirable to have a compound that is easily applied or administered which would provide (1) benefit to the skin, (2) treatment of diseases, (3) an advantageous means of drug/vitamin defivery and/or (4) cosmotological enhancements.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns new vitamin B6 analogs with antioxidative, radical-scavenging functions which counteract pathophysiological disorders especially connected with aging processes. The new agents counteract against oxidation- and age-mediated, acquired and inherited disease-related pathophysiological disorders. These functions render the new analogs useful for the treatment of these disorders which include but are not limited to multiple sclerosis, degenerative cell, tissue and organ processes, gerontological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Diabetes Type I, allergies, neurological disorders, skin diseases such as psoriasis, bone and bone tissue disorders such as osteoporosis. The new analogs are also antidotes against organo-phosphorous compounds.<br>
The new compounds are also suitable for the treatment of disorders associated with defects of the vitamin B6 metabolism and therefore act as vitamin B6 antagonists.<br>
The analogs of this invention have important anti-infective potential, for example antiviral activity, antiparasitic activity, and antifungal activity. Especially useful are the analogs of the invention for the treatment of viral diseases caused by enveloped viruses such as hepatitis, herpes and retro viruses but are also useful for the treatment of other viral infections, such as infection from influenza or rhinovirus.<br>
The new agents have cytoprotecting, immunomodulating, stimulating and inhibiting activity in vitro, suppress cell proliferation in cancer cells and cause cell death in these cells.<br>
These functions enable the new compounds to be useful for cosmetic or cosmeceutical or nutritional applications, keratological or skin-caring applications such as skin protection and skin restoration, in improving health, fitness, hygiene of<br><br>
4<br>
the human and animal body, skin, teeth, oral gums, nails, lips and hair. The new analogs are also useful agents for the treatment and prevention of sun or skin burns. In addition, the new analogs may be used as protecting dyes. The new analogs are also useful agents for the release of vitamins. They aid in the transport of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and cosmetic agents into cells, in particular specialized cells. As the new analogs are dephosphorylated by endogenous phosphorylases they will be transported into the cells where they are rephosphorylated and unable to pass out of the cell in phosphorylated form.<br>
Toxic or cytopathic effects have not been observed with the analogs of this invention in a number of cell culture systems. It appears that the new analogs act as relatively untoxic polyspecific drugs with an amphoteric structure, as multiplex buffer molecules. The new analogs have the general formula (Formula I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
Rl  is hydrogen, acyl of 2 - 22 carbons (excluding retinoyl), or an ascorbic acid<br>
group;<br>
R4 is hydrogen, hydroxy or an ascorbic acid group;<br>
R5 is an ascorbic acid group, or<br><br>
5<br><br>
wherein R2 is hydrogen, or aryl of 6 - 30 carbons; provided that at least one of R1<br>
or R2 is not hydrogen;<br>
Xl, X2 and X3 are independently O, S, or NR3;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 - 6 carbons, or acyl of 2 - 6 carbons;<br>
Y is O,S,or NH;<br>
Z is CH or N;<br>
and include salts and common esters derived from unreacted remaining functional<br>
groups in Formula I. In a preferred embodiment X1 is O, X2 is NH, X3 is S, Z is<br>
CH and Y is S. In another preferred embodiment, only one of R1 , R4 and R5 is an<br>
L-ascorbic acid group.<br>
The salts and common esters selected do not in a substantial way adversely affect the therapeutic, cosmetic, hygiene, anti-aging, cosmeceutical and nutritional functions of the new analogs.<br>
Analogs in which R1 is an  -hydroxy acid such as glycolic or lactic or malic acid residue and their common salts and esters are preferred. Also preferred are analogs in which R1 is derived from an FDA approved or accepted agent such as carminic acid and their common salts and esters. Carminic acid is a coloring agent approved by the FDA in foods and drugs. Also preferred are analogs in which R1 is derived from an FDA approved or accepted agent, a vitamin such as pantothenic acid which analogs may function as Vitamin B3 or B5 delivering agents or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and their common salts and esters. Also preferred are analogs in which<br><br>
6<br>
R1 is derived from glucuronic acid or a glucuronic acid derivative such as hyaJuronic acid with a molecular weight of 5 x 104 to 8 x 106 and their common salts and esters.<br>
     More preferred is a subgroup of analogs in which R1 has the above meanings and R2 is hydrogen and their common salts and esters.<br>
Most preferred in this subgroup are analogs in which Z is CH, X1 is oxygen, X2 is NH, X3 and Y are S, and their salts and common esters which do not in a substantial way adversely affect the therapeutic, cosmetic, hygiene, anti-aging, cosmeceutical and nutritional functions of the compounds in the subgroup.<br>
Analogs in which R2 is derived from a phenolic hydroxy group containing derivative such as phenol are preferred and their common salts and esters. Also preferred are analogs in which R2 is derived from phenolic hydroxy group containing derivative such as  -tocopherol and their common salts and esters. Also preferred are analogs in which R2 is derived from a coenzyme such as ubiquinone and their common salts and esters.<br>
More preferred is a subgroup of analogs in which R2 has the above meanings and R1 is hydrogen and their common salts and esters. Most preferred in this subgroup are analogs in which Z is CH, X1 is oxygen, X2 is NH, X3 and Y are S and their salts and common esters which do not in a substantial way adversely affect the therapeutic, cosmetic, hygiene, anti-aging, cosmeceutical and nutritional functions of the compounds in the subgroup.<br>
The analogs radical-scavenging function reduces the concentration of radicals nitrogen-containing radicals such as nitric oxide, their epigones (peroxinitrite, S-nitrosothiols), the hydroxyl radical, the superoxide anion radical, singlet oxygen;<br><br>
7<br>
they act as nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor and thus display general anticancer activity where the cancer is caused or believed to be caused by cancerigenic radicals. Therefore, the analogs of this invention act as antileukemic, anti-breast cancer, anti-skin cancer active compounds. The analogs also display immunologic activity and act as cytokine / trophokine modifiers, as anti-psoriatic or anti-allergic reagents.<br>
The analogs of the invention also act as a skin and/or tissue compatible coloring agent whose color can be influenced and modified by a number of factors such as degree of hydratization or derivativization (different salts exhibit different colors and the free acids also display different colors), the addition of other pigments, choice of the pH, or solvents. Color modification can be introduced with the appropriate choice of the cation. For example, for the analogs in which R1 is derived from carminic acid the magnesium, calcium, aluminum or other cations permit to vary the color from yellow to red to violet. Colored lacquers may be obtained, also varnishes for lipsticks, hair, nail coloring and other cosmetic uses (as additives to Mascara, or as Kajal additive). A number of analogs are fluorescent in a suitable environment. For example, the analogs in which R1 is derived from carminic acid display fluorescence emission at 575 mm. This can be used for hair coloring in clubs, discos and for show business. The colored hair fluoresces through light emission when illuminated in night clubs or by UV illumination, but the coloring agent protects from UV-introduced radical-mediated damages of hair or skin.<br>
The new analogs are useful as ultra-radical scavengers and skin-protectors. In this respect, the analogs in which Rl is derived from  -tocopherol is particularly useful as ultra-radical scavenger and also protects and stabilizes cosmetic cremes, lotions, essences or fluids. Therefore, the analogs of this invention are useful as multipurpose stabilizers for many dermatological products (in ointments, creams, lotions,<br><br>
8<br>
fluids, essences, special drug delivery systems such as sustained delivery systems for therapeutic, cosmetic or nutritional applications).<br>
As radical-scavengers the new analogs also function as flexible skin-caring agents, protect against the influence of ultraviolet light, in particular in areas where there is an ozone deficiency. With these functions the new analogs are useful to prevent premature skin aging, modulate environmental stress and preserve humidity, and act as a humectant.<br>
The new analogs act as wound-healing promoters and improve infection resistance.<br>
The analogs in which R2 is derived from ubiquinone augment the respiratory activity of ubiquinone Q10 by modulating mitochondrial apoptosis. This results in preserving energy and enhances the rejuvenation process.<br>
The analogs in which R1 is derived from glucuronic acid derivatives such as hyaluronic acid act as anti-oxidative skin protectors, as tissue clarifying agents, revitalize skin moisture by combining vitamin B6 with hyaluronic acid. Their radical-scavenging and radiation protecting properties vitalize the human skin against environmental noxae, skin drying, and render the new analogs useful as sun protection factor with long-time efficiency.<br>

These protecting groups can be removed under conventional de-protecting conditions.<br>
A "carboxylic acid -protecting group" is usually an ester of the free carboxylic acid group that can be easily removed after protection is no longer required, for example by hydrogenolysis.<br>
Preparation of the Compounds<br>
The new analogs can be prepared by procedures known in the art. The analogs in which Rl is acyl of 2 - 22 carbons may be prepared by reacting an acid chloride of the Formula I with an alkali salt of a compound of Formula II<br><br><br>
12<br>
wherein the substituents have the same meaning as described above for the compounds of Formula I.<br>
The reaction is carried out under substantially water-free conditions at temperatures between 0 and 30° C. For example, the compound of Formula II may be reacted with lactic acid chloride or carminic acid derivatives. Specifically, (Z)-5-[(5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]-4-pyridinyl]methylene]-2-thiooxo-4-thiazolidinone monosodium chloride may be reacted with protected lactic acid or carminic acid derivatives to afford the new analogs of the following formulae (Formula I/I and 1/2):<br><br>
Similarly, a compound of Formula II, a derivative or a salt thereof, may be reacted with a protected glucuronic acid derivative, pantothenic acid or a derivative<br><br>
13<br>
thereof, protected hyaluronic acid or a derivative thereof or another acyl group of 2 - 22 carbons to afford the corresponding analog of Formula I.<br>
Alternatively, the new analogs may be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula II with a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, for example dialkyl or dicycloalkyl, especially 1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimides or salts of such carbodiimides may be used as coupling agents. Other carbodiimides may also be used such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. These coupling agents usually act as dehydrating agents which would remove water to form as condensation products the new analogs.<br>
In general, when carrying out a process of this invention, those amino, hydroxy or carboxylic or other reactive groups which are not to participate in the esterification or condensation reaction must be protected until (1) either de-protection yields the final product; or (2) a specific protected group is to be involved in the next synthetic step or in a series of steps; or (3) the presence of the unprotected group in the ensuing reaction steps leading to the final product would not modify the intended sequence of reactions.<br>
The analogs in which R2 is aryl of 6 - 30 carbons may be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula III<br><br><br>
14<br>
with a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, for example dialkyl or dicycloalkyl, especially 1,3-dicyclohexyl carboiimides or salts of such carbodiimides may be used as coupling agents. The substituents in Formula III have the same meanings as described above for the compounds of Formula I. Other carbodiimides may also be used such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. These coupling agents usually act as dehydrating agents which would remove water t form the as condensation products the new analogs.<br>
In general, when carrying out a process of this invention, those amino, hydroxy or carboxylic or other reactive groups which are not to participate in the esterification or condensation reaction must be protected until (1) either de-protection yields the final product; or (2) a specific protected group is to be involved in the next synthetic step or in a series of steps; or (3) the presence of the unprotected group in the ensuing reaction steps leading to the final product would not modify the intended sequence of reactions.<br>
The above-described condensation reactions with carbodiimides are usually carried out in absolute basic solvents such as pyridine at 0 - 30° C, preferably room temperature for an extended time period, preferably from 12 -200 hours, most preferably 24-120 hours. An acidic ion exchange matrix such as DOWEX® may be used as catalyst.<br>
Synthesis of Vitamin B6 -L-Ascorbic Acid Derivatives<br>
Vitamin B6-analogs of formula (I) wherein R1, R4 or R5 is an L-ascorbic acid group may be prepared by standard procedures. Generally, reactive positions that are not to participate in the reaction must be protected with a suitable protecting group, namely the hydroxy group (at R1 and, if present, at R4) or the phosphate<br><br>
15<br>
group (at R5). of the vitamin B6-moiery, and if necessary the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring.. An L-ascorbic acid group may thus be introduced independently at positions R1, R4 or R5 of the vitamin B6 derivative of Formula I.<br>
For example, a vitamin B6-analog of Formula I with an L-ascorbic acid group at position R1 may be prepared by reacting, e. g., 6-deoxy-6-iodo-L-ascorbic acid in methanol in the presence of triethylamine with a vitamin B6 derivative in which R1 and R4 are hydrogen and the phosphate group and the nitrogen of the pyridine ring are protected with a suitable protecting group. The reaction proceeds under evolution of hydrogen iodide. After deprotection, a vitamin B6 derivative of formula (I) is obtained wherein R1 is 6-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid.<br>
In a similar fashion, a vitamin B6-analog with an L-ascorbic acid group at position R4 can be obtained by appropriately protecting the hydroxy group (R1) and the phosphate group (R5).<br>
A vitamin B6-analog with an L-ascorbic acid at position R5 can be prepared as follows:<br><br>
16<br><br>
2-C-[5-hydroxy-6-methyl-4-(4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-5-ylidene)methyl-3-pyridinyl]methyl-.   -L-Iyxo-3-hexulofuranosonic acid o   -lactone (C17HI6N2O8S2)<br>
Synthetic methods for producing such vitamin B6-analogs and suitable protecting groups employed therein are disclosed by W. Korytnyk, Synthesis of B6 Analogs (1979): Methods Enzymol., 62, 524. See also W. Korytnyk &amp; Miyoshi Ikawa, Synthesis of B6 Analogs (1970), Methods Enzymol. 18,454.<br>
Derivatives of L-ascorbic acid<br>
The 6-oxygen of ascorbic acid is readily derivatized with a variety of electrophylic reagents in aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyylsuifoxide (DMSO). For example, 6-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid is obtained<br><br>
17<br>
from L-sorbose [H.Muller &amp; T.Reichstein (1938) Helv. Chim. Acta, 21,237]. The synthesis and properties of several 6-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid derivatives, e.g., 6-deoxy-6-halo derivatives of L-ascorbic acid, are described in Helv. Chim. Acta, 63, 1728 (1980) [J. Kiss &amp; K.B. Berg].<br>
5-O-acyl or methyl derivatives of ascorbic acid are obtained after blocking the more reactive 2 and/or 6-oxygen functions, e. g., isopropylidene ketals..<br>
The synthesis of vitamin B6-C-2-L-ascorbic acid is described in Acta. Chem. Scand., (1962) 16, 1286 [E. Pironen &amp; I. Virtanen] and in Helv. Chim. Acta, (1966), 49, 989 [G. Kiss &amp; H. Ncukom].<br>
Analogs of ascorbic acid are described in Advanc, Carbohyd. Chem., (1946), 2, 79; and in Annals of the New York Academy of Science, (1990), Vol. 258 (C.G, King &amp;. J.J. Burns. The preparation of a vitamin B6-analog containing 6-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid phosphate has been described by W. Korytnyk, B. Lachmann &amp; N. Angelino (1972) in Biochemistry 11, 722.<br>
Tocopherol<br>
Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects cell membranes and other fat-soluble parts of the body, such as LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol). Protection of LDL-cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that both men and women who supplement with at least 100 IU of vitamin E per day for at least two years have a 37-41% drop in the risk of heart disease. Even more impressive is the 77% drop in non-fatal heart attacks reported in double-blind study, in which people were given 400- 800 IU vitamin E per day. Premature infant maintenance: 25-50 (typically 30) IU per day until 6-10 weeks of age (absorbed poorly in fat malabsorption disorders). If not feeding, can also be given as 125 ing/kg per week divided into two intramuscular doses on subsequent days.<br><br><br>

Vitamin E is a powerful vitamin and antioxidant, circulating in the blood and detoxifying free radicals (destructive by-products of metabolism), prevents damage to cell membranes, thereby reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. Further, vitamin E keeps "bad" cholesterol (LDL) from turning into even worse cholesterol - oxidized LDL - which initiates buildup of arterial plaque (atherogenesis) and can lead, ultimately, to serious heart disease. Finally, it also speeds healing in burn and post-operative patients and, recent studies suggest, seems to ease the pain and swelling of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, to reduce the risk of cataracts, to bolster the immune system, even to slow the progress of Parkinson's disease.<br>
A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin E exists in the form of tocopherols and tocotrienols. Four different tocopherols have been identified, and although the most active is alpha-tocopherol, researchers now believe there's a symbiotic relationship among the different tocopherols, that all work in concert to promote good health. The unit of measurement for vitamin E is the D-alpha-tocopherol equivalent, abbreviated as alpha-TE and computed in milligrams.<br>
Most common Vitamin E formulas contain from 3 to 15 mg. of E. The current RDA for Vitamin E is 10 mg per day for men, 8 mg per day for women,. 3 mg alpha-TE per day for neonates and 4 mg alpha-TE per day for infants. Pregnant and lactating women should increase their Vitamin E intake to approximately 10-12 mg per day.<br>
Vitamin B5<br>
Pantothenic acids' most important function is as an essential component in the production of coenzyme A, a vital catalyst that is required for the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, and protein into energy. Pantothenic acid is also referred to as<br><br><br>
19<br>
an antistress vitamin due to its vital role in the formation of various adrenal hormones, steroids, and cortisone, as well as contributing to the production of important brain neuro-transmitters such as acetylcholine. In addition to helping to fight depression pantothenic acid also supports the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract and is required for the production of cholesterol, bile, vitamin D, red blood cells, and antibodies.<br>
Most common B-complex formulas contain from 10 to 100 mg. of B5, though daily doses up to 1000 mg are not uncommon, especially for treatment of arthritis and allergies. The current RDA for pantothenic acid is 10 mg.<br>
Ascorbic Acid ("Vitamin C)<br>
Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, is important in forming collagen, a protein that gives structure to bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Vitamin C also helps maintain capillaries, bones and teeth, and aids in the absorption of iron.<br>
Ascorbic acid is readily absorbed from the intestines, ideally absorb about 80-90 percent of that ingested. It is used by the body in about two hours and then usually out of the blood within three to four hours.<br>
Ascorbic acid is essential for many oxidation reactions in the body. One important function of vitamin C is in the formation and maintenance of collagen, the basis of connective tissue, which is found in skin, ligaments, cartilage, vertebral discs, joint linings, capillary walls, and the bones and teeth. Collagen, and thus vitamin C, is needed to give support and shape to the body, to help wounds heal, and to maintain healthy blood vessels. Specifically, ascorbic acid works as a coenzyme to convert proline and lysine to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, both important to the collagen structure. For instance, oxidation of tyrosine and phenylalanine requires<br><br><br>
20<br>
an adequate supply of ascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid plays a role in formation of hydroxyproline, an integral constituent of collagen, which in turn is essential for growth of subcutaneous tissue, cartilage, and bone.<br>
Physiologically, the major function of ascorbic acid appears to be maintenance of normal intercellular substances throughout the body. This includes the formation of collagen, probably because of the action of ascorbic acid in synthesis of hydroxyproline. It also enhances the intercellular cement substance between the cells, the formation of bone matrix, and the formation of tooth dentin.<br>
Deficiency of ascorbic acid result in the failure of wounds to heal. This is caused by failure of the cells to deposit collagen fibrils and intercellular cement substances. As a result, healing of a wound may require several months instead of the several days ordinarily necessary. Failure to deposit collagen fibrils and other intercellular cement substances lead to blood vessel walls to become extremely fragile. The capillaries are especially likely to rupture and many small petechial hemorrages occur throughout the body.<br>
Lack of ascorbic acid causes cessation of bone growth. The cells of the growing epiphyses continue to proliferate but no new matrix is laid down and the bones fracture easily. When ossified bone fractures the osteoblasts fail to lay down new matrix and the fracture fails to heal.<br>
Vitamin C also aids the metabolism of tyrosine, folic acid, and tryptophan. Tryptophan is converted in the presence of ascorbic acid to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which forms serotonin, an important brain chemical. Vitamin C also helps folic acid convert to its active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, and tyrosine needs ascorbic acid to form the neurotransmitter substances dopamine and epinephrine. Vitamin C stimulates adrenal function and the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine<br><br><br>
21<br>
(adrenaline), our stress hormones; however, prolonged stress depletes vitamin C in the adrenals and decreases the blood levels. Ascorbic acid also helps thyroid hormone production, and it aids in cholesterol metabolism, increasing its elimination and thereby assisting in lowering blood cholesterol.<br>
Vitamin C is an antioxidant vitamin. By this function, it helps prevent oxidation of water-soluble molecules that could otherwise create free radicals, which may generate cellular injury and disease. Vitamin C also indirectly protects the fat-soluble vitamins A and E as well as some of the B vitamins, such as riboflavin, thiamine, folic acid, and pantothenic acid, from oxidation. Ascorbic acid acts as a detoxifier and may reduce the side effects of drugs such as cortisone, aspirin, and insulin; it may also reduce the toxicity of the heavy metals lead, mercury, and arsenic.<br>
Vitamin C is being shown through continued research to stimulate the immune system; through this function, along with its antioxidant function, it may help in the prevention and treatment of infections and other diseases. Ascorbic acid may activate neutrophils, the most prevalent white blood cells that work on the frontline defense in more hand-to-hand combat than other white blood cells. It also seems to increase production of lymphocytes, the white cells important in antibody production and in coordinating the cellular immune functions. In this way also, vitamin C may be helpful against bacterial, viral, and fungal diseases. In higher amounts, ascorbic acid may actually increase interferon production and thus activate the immune response to viruses; it may also decrease the production of histamine, thereby reducing immediate allergy potential. Further research must be done for more definitive knowledge about vitamin C's actions in the prevention and treatment of disease.<br>

Given the functions of vitamin C alone, it has a wide range of clinical uses. For the prevention and treatment of the common cold and flu syndrome, vitamin C produces a positive immuotogical response to help fight bacteria and viruses. Its support of the adrenal function and role in the production of adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine can help the body handle infections and stress of all kinds. Because of this adrenal-augmenting response, as well as thyroid support provided by stimulating production of thyroxine (T4) hormone, vitamin C may help with problems of fatigue and slow metabolism. It also helps counteract the side effects of cortisone drug therapy and may counteract the decreased cellular immunity experienced during the course of treatment with these commonly used immune-suppressive drugs.<br>
Because of ascorbic acid's role in immunity, its antioxidant effect, the adrenal support it provides, and probably its ability to make tissues healthy through its formation and maintenance of collagen, vitamin C may be used to treat a wide range of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and inflammatory problems of all kinds. Vitamin C may be used successfully in the treatment of many viral conditions, including colds, flus, hepatitis, Herpes simplex infections, mononucleosls, measles, and shingles. Recently, vitamin C has been shown in some studies to enhance the production and activity of interferes, an antiviral substance produced by our bodies. To affect these conditions, the vitamin C dosage is usually fairly high, at least 5-10 grams per day, but it is possible that much smaller doses are as effective. Vitamin C is also used to treat problems due to general inflammation from microorganisms, irritants, and/or decreased resistance; these problems may include cystitis, bronchitis, prostatitis, bursitis, arthritis (both osteo- and rheumatoid), and some chronic skin problems (dermatitis). With arthritis, there is some suggestion that increased ascorbic acid may improve the integrity of membranes in joints. In gouty arthritis, vitamin C improves the elimination of uric acid (the irritant) through the kidneys. Ascorbic acid has also<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
23<br>
been helpful for relief of back pain and pain from inflamed vertebral discs, as well as the inflammatory pain that is sometimes associated with rigorous exercise. In asthma, vitamin C may relieve the bronchospasm caused by noxious stimuli or when this tight-chest feeling is experienced during exercise.<br>
Vitamin C's vital function in helping produce and maintain healthy collagen allows it to support the body cells and tissues and bring more rapid healing to injured or aging tissues. Therefore, it is used by many physicians for problems of rapid aging, burns, fracture healing, bedsores and other skin ulcers and to speed wound healing after in-jury or surgery. Peptic ulcers also appear to heal more rapidly with vitamin C therapy. The pre- and postsurgical use of vitamin C supplementation can have great benefits. With its collagen function, adrenal support, and immune response support, it helps the body defend against infection, supports tissue health and healing, and improves the ability to handle the stress of surgery. Vitamin A and zinc are the other important pre- and postsurgical nutrients shown by research to reduce hospitalization time and increase healing rates, thereby preventing a number of potential complications and may be co-formulated with vitamin C.<br>
Vitamin C is also used to aid those withdrawing from drug addictions, addictions to such substances as narcotics and alcohol, as well as nicotine, caffeine, and even sugar-three very common addictions and abuses. High-level ascorbic acid may decrease withdrawal symptoms from these substances and increase the appetite and feeling of well-being. For this reason, it may be helpful in some depression and other mental problems associated with detoxification during withdrawal. Vitamin C also may reduce the effects of pollution, likely through its anrioxidant effect, its detoxifying help, and its adrenal and immune support; specifically, it may participate in protecting us from smog, carbon monoxide, lead, mercury, and cadmium.<br>

Vitamin C is a natural laxative and may help with constipation problems. In fact, the main side effect of too much vitamin C intake is diarrhea. For iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin C helps the absorption of iron (especially the nonheme or vegetable-source iron) from the gastrointestinal tract. In diabetes, it is commonly used to improve the utilization of blood sugar and thereby reduce it, but there is no clear evidence that regular vitamin C usage alone can prevent diabetes. There are some preliminary reports that ascorbic acid may help prevent cataract formation (probably through its antioxidant effect) and may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of glaucoma, as well as certain cases of male infertility caused from the clumping together of sperm, which decreases sperm function.<br>
Vitamin C has a probable role in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and, thereby, in reducing the risks of heart disease and its devastating results. It has been shown to reduce platelet aggregation, a factor important in reducing the formation of plaque and clots. Ascorbic acid has a triglyceride- and cholesterol-reducing effect and, more important, may help to raise the "good" HDL. This action needs further investigation, though the research is supportive so far. The prevention of scurvy takes very little vitamin C, about 10 mg. per day. This disease used to be a big concern and was often fatal unless the victim ate some citrus or other fresh fruit and vegetables containing a small amount of vitamin C.<br>
The RDA for adults is considered to be 60 mg. We need only about 10-20 mg. to prevent scurvy, and there is more than that in one portion of most fruits or vegetables. Infants need 35 mg; about 50 mg. between ages one and fourteen and 60 mg. afterward are the suggested minimums. During pregnancy, 80 mg. are required; 100 mg. are needed during lactation. Realistically, between 100-150 mg. daily is a minimum dosage for most humans.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
25<br>
Vitamin C needs, however, are increased with all kinds of stress, both internal (emotional) and external (environmental). Smoking decreases vitamin C levels and increases minimum needs. Birth control pills, estrogen for menopause, cortisone use, and aspirin also increase ascorbic acid requirements. Both nicotine and estrogen seem to increase copper blood levels, and copper inactivates vitamin C. In general, though, absorption of vitamin C from the intestines is good. Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) taken with iron helps the absorption of iron (and many minerals) and is important in treating anemia, but the iron decreases absorption of the ascorbic acid. Overall, it is probably best to take vitamin C as it is found in nature, along with the vitamin P constituents (discovered later)-the bioflavonoids, rutin, and hesperidin.<br>
Vitamin C works rapidly, so the total amount we take over the day should be divided into multiple doses (four to six) or taken as a time-released tablet a couple of times a day. When increasing or decreasing vitamin C intake, it is best to do so slowly because our body systems become accustomed to certain levels. Some nutritionists describe a problem of rebound scurvy in infants, especially when a high amount is taken by the mother during pregnancy but then the infant gets very little after birth and so suffers some deficiency symptoms. Overall, though, it is probably wise to reduce vitamin C intake slowly after taking high amounts, rather than to drop abruptly.<br>
A basic suggestion for vitamin C use is about 2-4 grams per day with a typical active and healthy city lifestyle. The optimum daily levels of vitamin C are between 2,500 and 10,000 mg. Clearly, requirements for vitamin C vary and may be higher according to state of health, age (needs increase with years), weight, activity and energy levels, and general metabolism. Stress, illness, and injuries further increase the requirements for ascorbic acid. Many authorities suggest that we take at least 500 mg. of vitamin C daily to meet basic body needs.<br><br>
26<br>
During times of specific illnesses, especially viral infections, doctors who use megadose vitamin C treatment suggest at least 20-40 grams daily, some of it intravenously. Vitamin C has been used safely and effectively in dosages of 10 grams or more dripped slowly (over 30-60 minutes) into the blood to reach optimum tissue levels before excretion, so as to bathe the cells in vitamin C.<br>
The following conditions may be treated with Vitamin C: abnormal Pap smear, alcohol withdrawal support, asthma, atherosclerosis, athletic support, backache, bruising, capillary fragility, cataracts, chemotherapy support, common cold/sore throat, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic , diabetes, eczema, gingivitis (periodontal disease) glaucoma, gout, hay fever, hepatitis, high cholesterol, HIV support, high blood pressure, hypoglycemia, enhancing immune function, infection, infertility (male), influenza, iron deficiency, macular degeneration, menopause, menorrhagia (heavy menstruation), minor injuries, morning sickness, recurrent ear infections, retinopathy, urinary tract infection, vitiligo and wound healing.<br>
Vitamin C conjugates of the present invention may be provided, for example, as tablets, both fast-acting and time-released, chewable tablets, powders and effervescents, and liquid form, as well as hand creams, lotions and the like.<br>
Lactic Acid<br>
Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid used as a moisturizer, pH adjuster and exfoliant in cosmetics. It is sometimes referred to as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Alpha-hydroxy acid molecules thin the stratum corneum (the skin's scaly outer layer), as well as hasten cell turnover which makes skis more resilient. These acids help to dissolve the bond, or "glue", that holds dead cells on the surface of the skin, help repair the aging cellular level (because the molecules are small enough to<br><br><br>
27<br>
penetrate the deeper layers of the skin). This helps in firming the underlying tissues for greater elasticity as well as encouraging more tissue activity. Alpha-Hydroxy acids help with age spots, lines, wrinkles, sun damage, tighten pores as well as help correct both dry and oily skin problems. Cosmetics that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) have become widely used in recent years. AHA products cause exfoliation, or shedding of the surface skin. The extent of exfoliation depends on the type and concentration of the AHA, its pH (acidity), and other ingredients in the product. Most cosmetics sold to consumers contain AHAs at levels up to 10 percent. Though found mainly in face and body creams and lotions, AHAs also can be used in other cosmetics, such as shampoos and cuticle softeners.<br>
Carminic Acid<br>
A major cause of skin cancer is repeated sunburns to the skin. Damage to DNA due to ultra violet radiation, excited forms of oxygen, and free radicals can cause mutations which lead to carcinogenesis. Carminic acid conjugates protect from UV-radiation induced radical-mediated damage.<br>
Hvaluronic Acid<br>
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan. It is a constituent of the intercellular matrix of connective tissue that exists in almost all vertebrates. HA is found at high concentrations in the umbilical cord, in the aqueous and vitreous humor of the eye, in synovial fluid in joint, in group A and C hemolytic streptococci, and in rooster combs.<br>
In nature, HA usually exists as a sodium salt (sodium hyaluronate) forming a highly viscous fluid with exceptional lubricating qualities. It plays an important role in a number of physiological functions, including protection and lubrication of cells,<br>

31 UV Protectant<br>
Energy from the sun reaches the earth as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet rays. Ultraviolet A is made up of wavelengths 320 to 400 nanometers (nm) in length; ultraviolet B wavelengths are 280 to 320 nm; and ultra- violet C wavelengths are 100 to 280 nm. Because the earth's atmosphere absorbs the UVC wavelengths, the only ultraviolet rays that reach the earth's surface are UVA and UVB. While a small amount of exposure to sunlight can be healthy and pleasurable, too much can be dangerous- Exposure to UV rays is linked to a number of harmful health effects. Skin cancer and other skin damage. Some effects of sunlight on the skin are visible within hours or days (e.g,, sunburn and tanning); other effects are delayed and cumulative and may be seen in months to years (e.g., skin cancer and photoaging). Skin cancer. The incidence of skin cancer cases is increasing rapidly. Over 1,000,000 new cases of skin cancer are likely to be diagnosed in the U.S. this year. Eighty percent of the UV exposure occurs before the age of 18 and the damage is cumulative over time. UV radiation exposure is implicated in the formation of non-melanoma and melanoma cancers.<br>
Premature aging. Sun exposure also causes premature aging of the skin. Photoaging of the skin is different than normal chronological aging. Regular sun bathers show photoaging changes early in life {before 30 years of age); while chronologically aged skin shows changes later (after 40 or more years of age). Freckling, fine wrinkling, and dilatation of capillaries are often seen early in the photoaging process; later on the photoaged skin develops irregular pigmentation, often called liver spots. Both photoaging and chronological aging cause wrinkling and loss of skin elasticity; however, they occur much earlier when the skin has been overexposed to the sun.<br>

Pharmaceutical Preparations<br>
The compounds of this invention are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage, i.e., that amount which, when administered to a mammal in need thereof, is sufficient to effect treatment, as described above (for example, to reduce or otherwise treat inflammation, pain and/or pyrexia in the mammal). Administration of the active compounds and salts described herein can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities.<br>
The level of the drug in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art, e.g., from about 0.01 percent weight (%w) to about 99.99%w of the drug based on the total formulation and about .0l%w to 99.99%w excipicnt. Preferably the drug is present at a level of about 10%w to about 70%w.<br>
Generally, an.acceptable daily dose is of about 0.0001 to 150 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably about 0.01 to 75 mg per kilogram body weight per day, and most preferably about 0.1 to 30 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 0.007 mg to 10.5 g per day, preferably about 0.7 to 5.25 g per day, and most preferably about 7.0 mg to 2.1 g per day.<br><br>
44<br>
Administration can be via any accepted systemic or local route, for example, via parenteral, oral (particularly for infant formulations), intravenous, nasal, transdermal or topical routes, in the form of solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, aerosols, emulsions or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages.<br>
The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and at least one of the active inventive compounds and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Carriers can be selected from the various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E. W. Martin.<br>
If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamme oleate, etc.<br>
The compounds of this invention are generally administered as a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a pharmaceutical excipient in combination with at least one of the inventive compounds. The level of the drug in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art, e.g., from about .01<br><br>
45<br>
percent weight (%w) to about 99.99%w of the drug based on the total formulation and about .01%w to 99.99%w excipient. Preferably, the formulation will be about 3.5 to 60% by weight of the pharmaceutically active compound, with the rest being suitable pharmaceutical exciplents.<br>
Intravenous Administration<br>
Intravenous injection has proven to be an important route of administration for antiviral agents. The compounds of the present invention can be administered via this route, for example, by dissolving the compound, salt, ester or ether in a suitable solvent (such as water or saline) or incorporation in a liposomal formulation followed, by dispersal into an acceptable infusion fluid. A typical daily dose of a compound of the invention can be administered by one infusion, or by a series of infusions spaced over periodic intervals.<br>
Oral Administration<br>
Oral administration can be used to deliver the inventive compounds using a convenient daily dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction or for renal impairment, or to compensate for the toxic effects of other medications administered contemporaneously. For such oral administration, a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable, non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. Such compositions may contain between .01 wt/wt% and 99.99 wt/wt% of the inventive compound, but<br><br>
46<br>
preferably such compositions will contain between 25 wt/wt% and about 80 wt/wt%.<br>
Preferably the compositions will take the form of a capsule, pill or tablet and thus the composition will contain, along with the active ingredient, a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, and the like; a disintegrant such as starch or derivatives thereof; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and the like; and a binder such as a starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum acacia, gelatin, cellulose and derivatives thereof, and the like. For oral administration to infants, a liquid formulation (such as a syrup or suspension) is preferred.<br>
Liposomal Formulations<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations based on liposomes have recently reached human clinical trials. Their benefits are believed related to favorable changes in tissue distribution and pharmacokinetic parameters that result from liposome entrapment of drugs, and may be applied to the compounds of the present invention bv those skilled in the art.<br>
The formulations can be designed to either target drug to disease sites [see: Lopez-Berestein et al., J. Infect. Dis., 151: 704-710 (1985); Gotfredsen et al., Biochemical Pharmacology, 32: 3389-3396 (1983)]; or to the reticuloendothelial system [see Eppstein et al., Int. J. Immunotherapy, 2: 115-126 (1986)], to increase duration of drug action [see: Gabizon et al., Cancer Res.. 42: 4734 (1982); Eppstein et al., Delivery Systems for Peptide Drugs, Eds. S.S. Davis, L. Ilium and E. Tomlinson, Plenum Pub. Corp., New York, pp. 277-283; C.A. Hunt, Biochemica et Biophysica Acta., 719: 450-463 (1982); and Senior et al., Biochemica et Biophysica Acta., 839: 1-8 (1985)], or to divert a drug away from organs that are particularly sensitive to its effects [see: Weinstein et al., Pharmac. Ther., 24:<br><br>
47<br>
207-233 (1983); Olson et al.,Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol, 18: 167-176 (1982); and Gabzion et al., supra.].<br>
Controlled release liposomal liquid pharmaceutical formulations for injection or oral administration are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,100. Liposomal applications for oral drug delivery of a lyophilized liposome/peptide drug mixture filled into intestine capsules have also been suggested, see U.S. Patent No. 4,348,384. The foregoing is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suppositories<br>
For systemic administration via suppository, traditional binders and carriers include, for example, polyalkaline glycol or triglycerides [e.g., PEG 1000 (96%) and PEG 4000 (4%)]. Such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing active ingredients in the range of from about 0.5 wt/wt% to about 10 wt/wt%; preferably from about 1 wt/wt% to about 2 wt/wt%.<br>
Liquids<br>
Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. an active compound (about 0.5% to about 20%), as described above, and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.<br>
Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 16th Ed., 1980. The composition to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in a pharmaceutically effective amount for relief of the particular condition being treated in accordance with the teachings of this invention.<br><br>

The mixture is heated to about 85 °C with stirring. The surfactants and polar solvents are mixed together to form the surfactant association structure phase. The surfactant association structure mixture and the remaining ingredients are added to the thickening/gelling agent mixture with constant stirring until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. Once uniform, the composition is poured into molds at room temperature.<br>
