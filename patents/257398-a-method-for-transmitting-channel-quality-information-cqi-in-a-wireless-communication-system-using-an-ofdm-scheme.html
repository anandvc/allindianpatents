Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system using an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and in particular, to an apparatus and<br>
method for transmitting/receiving channel quality information (CQI) for subcarriers<br>
between a mobile subscriber station (MSS) and a base station (BS).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With the rapid progress of mobile communication systems, the required amount of data<br>
and its processing speed are increasing rapidly Generally, when data is transmitted over a<br>
wireless channel at a high speed, the data experiences a high bit error rate (BER) due to<br>
multipath fading and Doppler spread A wireless access scheme appropriate for the<br>
wireless channel is required to compensate for the high BER, so a Spread Spectrum (SS)<br>
scheme having advantages of lower transmission power and lower detection probability<br>
is becoming popular.<br>
The SS scheme is roughly classified into a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)<br>
scheme and a Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) scheme.<br>
The DSSS scheme can actively adjust to a multipath phenomenon occurring in a wireless<br>
channel using a rake receiver that uses path diversity of the wireless channel The DSSS<br>
scheme can be efficiently used at a transfer rate of 10 Mbps or less However, when<br>
transmitting data at a rate of 10 Mbps or higher, the DSSS scheme increases in inter-chip<br>
interference, causing an abrupt increase in hardware complexity Also, it is known that the<br>
DSSS scheme has a limitation in user capacity due to multiuser interference.<br>
The FHSS scheme can reduce multichannel interference and narrowband impulse noise<br>
because it transmits data, hopping between frequencies with random sequences In the<br>
FHSS scheme, correct coherence between a transmitter and a receiver is very important,<br>
but it is difficult to achieve coherent detection<br><br>
during high-speed data transmission.<br>
An Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme is a<br>
scheme appropriate for high-speed data transmission in a wire/wireless channel,<br>
and on which extensive research is being conducted. The OFDM scheme<br>
transmits data using multiple carriers, and is a type of a Multi-Carrier Modulation<br>
(MCM) scheme that parallel-converts a serial input symbol stream into parallel<br>
symbols and modulates the parallel symbols with a plurality of narrower-band<br>
subcarriers having mutual orthogonality before transmission. A subcarrier in a<br>
specific time interval is referred to as a "tone."<br>
The OFDM scheme has high frequency efficiency because it uses a<br>
plurality of subcarriers having mutual orthogonality as described above. Because<br>
a process of modulating/demodulating the plurality of subcarrier signals is<br>
equivalent to a process of performing an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform<br>
(IDFT) and a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a transmitter and a receiver can<br>
modulate and demodulate the subcarrier signals at a high speed using the Inverse<br>
Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), respectively.<br>
Because the OFDM scheme is appropriate for high-speed data<br>
transmission, it has been adopted as a standard scheme under the Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11a standard, the HIPELAN/2<br>
High-Speed Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) standard, the IEEE 802.16<br>
standard, the Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard, the Digital Terrestrial<br>
Television Broadcasting (DTTB) standard, the Asymmetric Digital Subscriber<br>
Line (ADSL) standard, and the Very-high data rate Digital Subscriber Line<br>
(VDSL) standard.<br>
In a communication system using the OFDM scheme (hereinafter referred<br>
to as an "OFDM communication system"), a structure of a frequency domain of<br>
an OFDM symbol utilizes subcarriers. The subcarriers are divided into data<br>
subcarriers used for data transmission, pilot subcarriers used for transmitting<br>
symbols in a predefined pattern for various estimation purposes, and null<br>
subcarriers for a guard interval and a static component. All of the subcarriers<br>
except for the null subcarriers, i.e., the data subcarriers and the pilot subcarriers,<br>
are effective subcarriers.<br>
An Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme,<br>
which is a multiple access scheme based on the OFDM scheme, divides the<br><br>
effective subcarriers into a plurality of subcarrier sets, i.e., subchannels. The<br>
"subchannel" refers to a channel comprised of at least one subcarrier, and the<br>
subcarriers constituting the subchannel may be either adjacent to each other, or<br>
not adjacent to each other. A communication system using the OFDM A scheme<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as an "OFDMA communication system") can<br>
simultaneously provide services to a plurality of users.<br>
A general subchannel allocation structure in the OFDMA communication<br>
system will now be described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the subcarriers used in the OFDMA communication<br>
system include a DC subcarrier representing a static component in a time domain,<br>
the subcarriers representing a high-frequency band of a frequency domain, i.e., a<br>
guard interval in the time domain, and the effective subcarriers. The effective<br>
subcarriers constitute a plurality of subchannels, and in FIG. 1, the effective<br>
subcarriers constitute three subchannels, i.e., a subchannel #1 to a subchannel #3.<br>
The OFDMA communication system uses an Adaptive Modulation and<br>
Coding (AMC) scheme in order to support high-speed data transmission through<br>
a wireless channel. The AMC scheme refers to a data transmission scheme for<br>
adaptively selecting a modulation scheme and a coding scheme according to a<br>
channel state between a cell, i.e., a base station (BS), and a mobile subscriber<br>
station (MSS), thereby increasing the entire cell efficiency.<br>
The AMC scheme has a plurality of modulation schemes and a plurality<br>
of coding schemes, and modulates and codes channel signals with an appropriate<br>
combination of the modulation schemes and the coding schemes. Commonly,<br>
each combination of the modulation schemes and the coding schemes is referred<br>
to as a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), and a plurality of MCSs with a<br>
level 1 to a level N are defined by the number of the MCSs. One of the MCS<br>
levels is adaptively selected according to a channel state between a BS and an<br>
MSS wirelessly connected to the BS.<br>
In order to use the AMC scheme, an MSS should report a channel state,<br>
i.e., CQI (Channel Quality Information), of a downlink to a BS. In the current<br>
IEEE 802.16 communication system, it is provided that an MSS should report the<br>
CQI of a downlink to a corresponding BS using a Report Request/Report<br>
Response (REP-REQ/REP-RSP) scheme.<br><br>
That is, a BS transmits an REP-REQ message to a particular MSS, and the MSS transmits<br>
an REP-RSP message including the CQI of a downlink to the BS in response to the REP-<br>
REQ message For example, the CQI can include an average value and a standard<br>
deviation value of a carner-to-mterference and noise ratio (CINR) or a received signal<br>
strength indicator (RSSI).<br>
US6904283 to Li et al describes a method and apparatus for subcarrier selection for<br>
systems. In one embodiment, a method for subcarrier seclection for a system employing<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) comprises partitioning<br>
subcarriers into groups of at least one cluster of subcarriers, receiving an indication of a<br>
selection by the subscriber of one or more groups in the groups, and allocating at least<br>
one cluster in the one or more groups of clusters selected by the subcarrier for use in<br>
communication with the subscriber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, because the REP-REQ message does not include any information defining the<br>
uplink resource through which the MSS can transmit the REP-RSP message, the MSS<br>
attempts a random access in order to send an uplink resource allocation request to the BS<br>
The random access may delay transmission of the REP-RSP message, preventing the<br>
application of the correct CQI in the AMC scheme Undesirably, the transmission of the<br>
REP-RSP message functions as signaling overhead Accordingly, there is a demand for a<br>
scheme for transmitting the correct CQI in real time with a minimized signaling<br>
overhead.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
transmitting/receiving CQI with a minimized signaling overhead in an OFDM/OFMDA<br>
communication system.<br><br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
transmitting/receiving CQI in real time in an OFDM/OFDMA communication system.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method<br>

transmitting/receiving the CQI in an OFDM/OFDMA communication system.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a transmission/reception<br>
apparatus and method capable of reducing CQI-related overhead for an MSS in a band<br>
AMC mode in an OFDM/OFDMA communication system.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
selecting a specific band having the best state from several bands and differentially<br>
transmitting/receiving CQI for the selected band in an OFDM/OFDMA communication<br>
system.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or<br>
similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they<br>
are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein has been<br>
omitted for conciseness.<br>
The OFDMA communication system described herein proposes a scheme<br>
for transmitting correct CQI (Channel Quality Information) of a downlink in real<br>
time with minimized signaling overhead in order to support an AMC scheme. In<br>
the proposed scheme, a CQI channel (CQICH) region is allocated to a predefined<br>
interval of an uplink frame, and each MSS transmits its measured CINR<br>
information of a downlink through the allocated CQICH region. In this case,<br>
every uplink frame includes CINR information measured by each MSS, enabling<br>
a real-time AMC scheme. Allocation of the CQICH region follows a rule defined<br>
in each system. For example, channel information expressed with n bits is<br>
converted into M CQI symbols and carried by M tones allocated to a CQICH by<br>
OFDM modulation. All of the MSSs can be allocated their unique CQICH regions.<br>
In addition, the MSSs are allocated unique frequency resources on a<br>
subchannel or a bin basis. Here, the bin is comprised of at least one OFDM<br>
symbol in at least one subcarrier. When a particular MSS is allocated a frequency<br>
resource on a per-subchannel basis, the MSS is described as being in a diversity<br>
mode, and when a particular MSS is allocated a frequency resource on a per-bin<br>
basis, the MSS is described as being in a band AMC mode.<br><br>
The band is defined as a cluster of a plurality of adjacent subcarriers,<br>
unlike a subchannel defined as a cluster of a plurality of possibly nonadjacent<br>
subcarriers. That is, a difference between the diversity mode and the band AMC<br>
mode consists in whether the subcarriers allocated to one MSS are spaced apart<br>
from each other or adjacent to each other in a frequency domain. In this<br>
specification, for the sake of convenience, the subchannels are regarded as<br>
clusters of nonadjacent subcarriers, and bands are regarded as clusters of adjacent<br>
subcarriers.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an example of an OFDM frame structure<br>
including bands and bins in an OFDMA communication system. Referring to FIG.<br>
2, the OFDM frame structure includes one downlink (DL) OFDM frame and one<br>
uplink (UL) OFDM frame. The downlink frame is followed by a transmission<br>
transition gap (TTG), and the uplink frame is followed by a reception transition<br>
gap (RTG). The downlink and uplink OFDM frames are each comprised of B<br>
bands in a frequency domain, and each band includes adjacent subcarriers. Small<br>
blocks constituting each frame represent bins. The bins are comprised of 2<br>
subcarriers and 3 OFDM symbols.<br>
In the downlink frame, first to third time intervals are regions allocated<br>
for control. Specifically, the first and second time intervals are allocated to a<br>
downlink preamble for downlink control, and the third time interval is allocated<br>
to a system information channel (SICH). In the uplink frame, first to third time<br>
intervals are allocated to an ACK/NACK channel for Hybrid Automatic Repeat<br>
Request (HARQ) support and a CQICH.<br>
An MSS determines if it will operate in the diversity mode or the band<br>
AMC mode, according to its channel state. Each MSS can determine the state of a<br>
downlink channel that it is receiving through the preamble of the downlink, and<br>
analyzes the CINR or the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of the<br>
channel and the channel variation rate in terms of frequency and time based on<br>
the accumulated channel state information. As a result of the analysis, if it is<br>
determined that the channel state is stable, the MSS operates in the band AMC<br>
mode, and otherwise, the MSS operates in the diversity mode. The phrase "stable<br>
channel state" refers to a state in which the CINRs or the RSSIs of the channel are<br>
generally high and the channel does not suffer abrupt variation with the passage<br>
of time.<br>
A criterion for the channel state analysis, based on which one of the<br><br>
diversity mode and the band AMC mode are selected, follows a rule defined in<br>
the system. Also, a detailed operation of selecting the operation modes can be<br>
implemented in a different way according to each system. That is, mode transition<br>
can be made at the request of an MSS monitoring a state of a received channel, or<br>
by a BS that has received a channel state report from the MSS. The important<br>
thing is the fact that when the channel state is good and its variation rate is low,<br>
the MSS operates in the band AMC mode, and otherwise, the MSS operates in the<br>
diversity mode.<br>
In the diversity mode, because each MSS is allocated a resource on a per-<br>
subchannel basis and the subcarriers constituting a subchannel are spaced apart<br>
from each other in a frequency domain, an average value for the full frequency<br>
band is enough for the channel CINR information necessary for the AMC. A<br>
CINR measured by each MSS is converted into n-bit information and then<br>
mapped to an M-symbol CQICH. That is, if the number of MSSs is defined as<br>
NMSS, the amount of CQI-related overhead to be allocated to an uplink is M*NMSS.<br>
In the band AMC mode, because each MSS is allocated a resource on a<br>
per-bin basis and the bins are adjacent to each other in a frequency domain, each<br>
MSS is allocated a partial limited interval of the full frequency band. Therefore,<br>
each MSS measures an average CINR for the limited interval (or a band to which<br>
the limited interval belongs), not for the full frequency band, and delivers the<br>
measured average CINR to a BS, thereby enabling a more elaborate AMC. In this<br>
case, in order to indicate the CINR measured by each MSS, n-bit information is<br>
needed per band and (B*n)-bit information is converted into M CQI symbols per<br>
MSS.<br>
As a result, the CQI-related overhead to be allocated to an uplink<br>
becomes equal to B*M*NMSS. This means that a considerable amount of the<br>
uplink resources should be spared for the CQI-related control information.<br>
Therefore, the present invention proposes a technique capable of greatly reducing<br>
the CQI-related overhead for an MSS in the band AMC mode.<br>
Before a description of the CQICH management technique proposed by<br>
the present invention is given, a method and apparatus for transmitting/receiving<br>
CQI in an OFDMA communication system will be described in brief with<br>
reference to FIGs. 3 and 4. Herein, the description will be made with reference to<br>
a CQICH structure adopted in HPi (High-speed Portable Internet).<br><br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a transmitter in an OFDMA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the transmitter is comprised of an encoder 211, a modulator<br>
213, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 215, a subchannel allocator 217, an<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit 219, a parallel-to-serial (P/S)<br>
converter 221, a guard interval inserter 223, a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter<br>
225, and a radio frequency (RF) processor 227.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, when the channel quality information (CQI) to be<br>
transmitted is generated, the bits indicating the CQI (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"CQI bits") are input to the encoder 211. For example, the CQI can include an<br>
average value and a standard deviation value of a carrier-to-interference and noise<br>
ratio (CINR) or a received signal strength indicator (RSSI).<br>
The encoder 211 codes the input CQI bits with a predetermined coding<br>
scheme, and outputs the coded bits to the modulator 213. For example, a block<br>
coding scheme having a predetermined coding rate can be used as the coding<br>
scheme.<br>
The modulator 213 modulates the coded bits output from the encoder 211<br>
with a predetermined modulation scheme, and outputs modulation symbols to the<br>
S/P converter 215. Here, the modulation scheme can include a Differential Phase<br>
Shift Keying (DPSK) scheme, such as a Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying<br>
(DBPSK) scheme or a Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK)<br>
scheme. The S/P converter 215 parallel-converts the serial modulation symbols<br>
output from the modulator 213, and outputs the parallel modulation symbols to<br>
the subchannel allocator 217.<br>
The subchannel allocator 217 allocates the parallel modulation symbols<br>
output from the S/P converter 215 to subcarriers of a predetermined CQICH, and<br>
outputs the allocation results to the IFFT unit 219. Here, the CQICH is comprised<br>
of at least one nonadjacent subcarrier for the diversity mode, and at least one<br>
adjacent subcarrier for the band AMC mode. The IFFT unit 219 performs N-point<br>
IFFT on the signal output from the subchannel allocator 217, and outputs the<br>
resultant signal to the P/S converter 221. The P/S converter 221 serial-converts<br>
the signal output from the IFFT unit 219, and outputs the resultant signal to the<br>
guard interval inserter 223.<br>
The guard interval inserter 223 inserts a guard interval signal into the<br><br>
signal output from the P/S converter 221, and outputs the resultant signal to the<br>
D/A converter 225. Here, the guard interval is inserted to remove interference<br>
between an OFDM symbol transmitted for a previous OFDM symbol time and an<br>
OFDM symbol transmitted for a current OFDM symbol time in the OFDMA<br>
communication system.<br>
The guard interval is inserted using one of a 'cyclic prefix' scheme in<br>
which a predetermined number of last samples of a time-domain OFDM symbol<br>
are copied and then inserted into an effective OFDM symbol, and a 'cyclic<br>
postfix' scheme in which a predetermined number of first samples of a time-<br>
domain OFDM symbol and then inserted into an effective OFDM symbol.<br>
The D/A converter 225 analog-converts the signal output from the guard<br>
interval inserter 223, and outputs the resultant signal to the RF processor 227.<br>
Here, the RF processor 227, including a filter, a mixer and an amplifier, performs<br>
the RF processing on the signal output from the D/A converter 225 such that the<br>
signal output from the D/A converter 225 can be transmitted over the air, and<br>
transmits the RF-processed signal over the air via a transmission antenna.<br>
FIG. 4 is a detailed diagram illustrating structures of the encoder 211 and<br>
the modulator 213 illustrated in FIG. 3. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the encoder 211 is<br>
comprised of an (m,n) block encoder, and the modulator 213 is comprised of a<br>
switch 411, a DBPSK modulator 413, and a DQPSK modulator 415.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, n CQI bits are input to the (m,n) block encoder 211.<br>
The (m,n) block encoder 211 block-codes the n CQI bits into m symbols, and<br>
outputs the m symbols to the switch 411. The switch 411 outputs the signal output<br>
from the (m,n) block encoder 211 to the DBPSK modulator 413 or the DQPSK<br>
modulator 415 according to the modulation scheme used in the transmitter. For<br>
example, when the transmitter uses the DBPSK scheme, the switch 411 outputs<br>
its input signal to the DBPSK modulator 413, and when the transmitter uses the<br>
DQPSK scheme, the switch 411 outputs its input signal to the DQPSK modulator<br>
415.<br>
The DBPSK modulator 413 modulates the signal output from the (m,n)<br>
block encoder 211 with the DBPSK scheme, and outputs (m+1) modulation<br>
symbols. The DQPSK modulator 415 modulates the signal output from the (m,n)<br>
block encoder 211 with the DQPSK scheme, and outputs  modulation<br><br>
symbols.<br>
A description will now be made of a CQI structure and a CQICH<br>
management scheme according to an operation mode of an MSS.<br>
First, the diversity mode will be described. As described above, the<br>
diversity mode refers to an operation mode in which a frequency band is divided<br>
into subchannels, each of which is a set of nonadjacent subcarriers, and in this<br>
mode, each MSS is allocated a predetermined number of the subchannels,<br>
determined according to the amount of transmission information. In this case,<br>
because each MSS receives information allocated to subcarriers uniformly<br>
distributed over the full system frequency band, the MSS measures an average<br>
CINR value for the full frequency band of a downlink frame and generates the<br>
measured average CINR as CQI.<br>
If a CQICH allocated to each MSS can accept n-bit CQI information, the<br>
MSS can express one of the 2n predetermined CINR intervals. As a result, each<br>
MSS transmits an interval including an average CINR value for the full frequency<br>
band to a BS through a CQICH. In the diversity mode, because the average CINR<br>
value for the full frequency band becomes CQI, this is referred to as "full CQI." If<br>
the number of MSSs is defined as NMSS, the number of tones allocated to a<br>
CQICH in an uplink becomes equal to M*NMSS. Because an allocation region for<br>
the CQICH is located in a predetermined position in a control signal interval of an<br>
uplink, a separate control signal for the designation of a CQICH position is not<br>
required. A CQICH is allocated every uplink frame.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example of a structure of full CQI.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, when two MSSs are located in a cell, the MSSs receive<br>
downlink signals through different subcarriers. It will be assumed herein that the<br>
MSSs each have a CQICH transmitter for converting 5-bit input information into<br>
12 CQI symbols.<br>
Each MSS calculates an average CINR for the full frequency band<br>
through a preamble of a downlink frame. For example, it is assumed that an<br>
MSS#1 has acquired 8.7 dB and an MSS#2 has acquired 3.3 dB. Because the<br>
acquired values are average values for the full frequency band, they can be<br>
different from the actual values of the respective subcarriers. Because the<br>
measured value, 8.7 dB, of the MSS#1 falls within a range of between 8 and 9 dB,<br>
it is converted into 5-bit CQI information '10010' indicating the corresponding<br><br>
range. Likewise, a measured value, 3.3 dB, of the MSS#2 is converted into CQI<br>
'Oil01'. Subsequently, the respective CQI is coded and then modulated into 12-<br>
tone CQI symbols by the CQICH transmitters of the respective MSSs. In each<br>
MSS, the CQI symbols are mapped to a CQICH region allocated to the<br>
corresponding MSS, in a UL control symbol region.<br>
Next, the band AMC mode will be described. In the band AMC mode, a<br>
full frequency band is divided into bands which are sets of adjacent subcarriers,<br>
and in this mode, each MSS is allocated a set of bins which are unit elements<br>
forming the band. A bin is a cluster of adjacent tones in the frequency and the<br>
time domains. Because adjacent bins in the frequency and time domains are<br>
allocated to each MSS, the MSS is allocated adjacent resources in the frequency<br>
and time domains.<br>
An MSS in the band AMC mode should convert an average CINR value<br>
for respective frequency bands of B bands constituting the full system frequency<br>
band, not the average CINR for the full frequency band, into the CQI. Assuming<br>
that the average CINR value for the respective frequency bands of the B bands is<br>
expressed with n-bit information, if the CINR values for all of the B bands are<br>
reported, the number of uplink tones required for a CQICH becomes equal to<br>
B*M*NMSS. Because this value corresponds to an amount that could possibly be<br>
occupying most of the uplink resources, there is a demand for a special CQI<br>
generation method and CQICH management method for the band AMC mode.<br>
An MSS in the band AMC mode transmits the CQI indicating if an<br>
average CINR value for n bands selected from B bands constituting the full<br>
frequency band has increased or decreased from the previous value, to a BS using<br>
a CQICH. Because a difference between the current average CINR value for the<br>
bands and the previous average CINR value becomes the CQI, this is referred to<br>
as the "differential CQI."<br>
If the number of MSSs located in a cell is defined as NMss, the number of<br>
CQICH tones allocated to an uplink becomes equal to M*NMSS. Because an<br>
allocation region for the CQICH is located in a predetermined position in a<br>
control signal interval of an uplink, a separate control signal for designating a<br>
position in the CQICH allocation region is not required. The differential CQI is<br>
allocated and transmitted every frame after an absolute CINR value in a message<br>
form is delivered. The absolute CINR value is periodically transmitted at intervals<br>
of several or tens of frames in order to update the CINR values for respective<br><br>
bands, stored in a BS.<br>
A scheme using the differential CQI delivers a channel condition of each<br>
band using relatively lower overhead. Because the BS can monitor a CINR of<br>
each band through the differential CQI, it can perform optimized AMC for each<br>
band, contributing to an increase in the entire throughput of the system.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an example of a structure of differential<br>
CQI according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6,<br>
when two MSSs are located in a cell, the MSSs receive downlink signals through<br>
different subcarriers. The MSSs each calculate an average CINR for their<br>
corresponding frequency bands of the downlink preambles, for each of their<br>
allocated bands in the full frequency band of an uplink.<br>
For example, it will be assumed that the full frequency band is divided<br>
into a total of 6 bands, and an absolute average CINR value for each band has<br>
been transmitted to a BS in a message form through a previous uplink frame.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, an MSS#1 selects 5 bands #0, #1, #3, #4 and #5<br>
having higher average CINR values in a previous frame. The MSS#1 determines<br>
the differential CQI for the respective bands by comparing the average CINR<br>
values (represented by dotted lines in FIG. 6) measured in the previous frame with<br>
the currently measured CINR values (represented by solid lines in FIG. 6), for the<br>
selected 5 bands. If a current value is greater than its previous value, a bit for the<br>
corresponding band is set to '1', and if a current value is less than its previous<br>
value, a bit for the corresponding band is se to '0'.<br>
In case of FIG. 6, a differential CQI value for the selected 5 bands<br>
becomes '11010', and the differential CQI value becomes an input to a CQI<br>
symbol modulator. In the same manner, an MSS#2 generates a differential CQI<br>
value '01010' for 5 bands #1, #2, #3, #4 and #5, for the CQI symbolization.<br>
The two differential CQI values are mapped to CQICH regions allocated<br>
individually to the MSSs in the UL control symbol region. Then a BS updates a<br>
previously stored absolute average CINR value for each band based on the<br>
received differential CQI information for each band, thereby acquiring a current<br>
average CINR value for each band. In this manner, the BS can perform more<br>
elaborate AMC based on the channel information for each band.<br><br>
In this case, a band #0 is selected for the MSS#1 and a band #4 is selected<br>
for the MSS#2. Because the selected bands have higher CINRs, the BS selects an<br>
AMC level available for the high-speed transmission, and transmits the downlink<br>
data for the MSS#1 and the downlink data for the MSS#2 through the band #0<br>
and the band #4, respectively.<br>
In a process of transmitting the differential CQI, the MSSs are not<br>
required to separately inform as to which bands the respective bits of the<br>
differential CQI are mapped, for the following reason. That is, because the MSSs<br>
are operating in the band AMC mode, there is a very low probability that the<br>
order of bands measured at the time when an absolute CINR value for each band<br>
is transmitted will change before the next absolute CINR is transmitted. If the<br>
channel state suffers a considerable change, the MSSs transition to the diversity<br>
mode, in which only the full CQI is used instead of the differential CQI.<br>
That is, in the band AMC mode, a probability is low at which a channel<br>
varies with the passage of time, and this means that a channel state of each band<br>
does not suffer a considerable change for a predetermined amount of time. In the<br>
case of the band AMC mode, there is a high probability that a band having a high<br>
average CINR record will continuously show a high CINR and a band having a<br>
low average CINR record will continuously show a low CINR, within the<br>
predetermined time. However, there is a low probability that a channel state of a<br>
band exhibiting a high average CINR will abruptly change exhibiting a low CINR<br>
within a predetermined time.<br>
The "predetermined time" defined to guarantee the stability of the<br>
channel is a system parameter determined through computer simulation and<br>
actual measurement. Also, the "predetermined time" is used as a CQICH report<br>
cycle in the band AMC mode. The "CQICH report cycle" refers to a time interval<br>
between a frame where an MSS reports an absolute value of an average CINR<br>
value for each band in a message form, and the next absolute value report frame.<br>
In an interval between the consecutive absolute value report frames, the<br>
differential CQI values rather than the absolute CINR values are repeatedly<br>
transmitted at shorter time intervals.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of an MSS according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, an MSS starts a CQI<br>
report operation in step 700, and determines in step 710 whether the current frame<br>
is a frame where it should deliver an absolute average CINR value for each band<br><br>
or a frame where it should transmit the differential CQI. The delivering of the<br>
absolute CINR value should be achieved in a cycle, and the cycle, as described<br>
above, is determined as a system parameter. For the efficiency of the uplink<br>
resources, the absolute CINR value is transmitted less frequently, compared with<br>
the differential CQI.<br>
If it is determined that the current frame is a frame where it should<br>
deliver the absolute CINR value, that is not the differential CQI, the MSS<br>
proceeds to step 721. In step 721, the MSS measures the average CINR values for<br>
all of the B bands constituting the full frequency band. In step 722, the MSS<br>
selects N bands according to the measured CINR values. N is greater than or<br>
equal to the number 'n' of bits allocated to a CQICH, and is less than or equal to<br>
the total number 'B' of bands. The reason for selecting the N bands is to prepare<br>
for a case where it is not possible to measure the CINR values for all of the B<br>
bands due to the limitation of uplink resources. The selected N bands may be the<br>
bands having the highest CINR values. In an alternative embodiment, however,<br>
they can be selected according to a rule defined in the system.<br>
The MSS re-selects the n bands where it will report an<br>
increment/decrement of a CINR using differential CQI, among the N bands. A<br>
selection algorithm for the n bands is an algorithm using only the CINR<br>
information for the N bands as an input parameter, and is shared by the MSS and<br>
a BS. That is, the BS can recognize the n bands selected by the MSS based on the<br>
CINR information for the N bands. Likewise, the n bands can be the bands having<br>
the highest CINR values among the N bands.<br>
Next, in step 723, the MSS generates a message including the CINR<br>
values for the selected n bands and indexes of the selected n bands. Thereafter, in<br>
step 724, the generated message is mapped to an uplink frame and then<br>
transmitted to a BS. Then the BS determines a modulation scheme and a coding<br>
rate for each band of the MSSs according to the CINR values for the n bands and<br>
the CINR values for each band of other MSSs.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 710 that the current frame is a frame<br>
for transmission of a differential CQI, the MSS proceeds to step 711. In step 711,<br>
the MSS measures the average CINR values for the respective bands. The reason<br>
for measuring the CINR values for all of the B bands is to monitor a channel<br>
variation situation for each band. The reason is because when the channel state<br>
suffers an abrupt change, it is necessary to transition from the band AMC mode to<br><br>
the diversity mode.<br>
Next, in step 712, the MSS reads the previously stored CINR values for<br>
the respective bands in a previous frame, for the n bands selected during the<br>
transmission of the previous absolute CINR values from among all of the B bands.<br>
In step 713, the MSS compares the measured values with the read CINR values<br>
for the corresponding bands in the previous frame. In step 714, if the measured<br>
CINR values are greater than or equal to the read CINR values as a result of the<br>
comparison, the MSS codes bits for corresponding bands in the differential CQI<br>
value into '1', and if the measured CINR values are less than the read CINR<br>
values, the MSS codes the bits into '0', thereby generating n-bit differential CQI.<br>
In step 715, the measured CINR values for the respective bands are stored<br>
to be used as reference values in the next frame. In step 716, the n-bit differential<br>
CQI is modulated into CQICH symbols. In step 717, the CQICH symbols are<br>
mapped to an uplink frame and then transmitted to the BS.<br>
Then the BS estimates a change of the n bands based on the differential<br>
CQI. That is, the BS increases or decreases, by a predetermined value, the<br>
absolute CINR values for the n bands among the stored absolute CINR values for<br>
the respective bands according to the respective bits of the differential CQI<br>
information. Because the differential CQI indicates only an increment/decrement<br>
of a CINR value for a corresponding band, the BS cannot determine a difference<br>
between the CINR value and a previous CINR value. However, given that the<br>
band AMC mode is provided for an environment where channel variation of each<br>
band is stable, the performance deterioration caused by the defect is negligible as<br>
compared with an increase in efficiency of uplink resources due to the use of the<br>
differential CQI.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention transmits the CQI during every<br>
frame with minimized signaling overhead in an OFDMA communication system,<br>
thereby applying the CQI in real time. In addition, the present invention proposes<br>
a method for generating the CQI suitable for characteristics of the diversity mode<br>
and the band AMC mode, and a scheme for managing the CQI.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE "A METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING CHANNEL QUALITY<br>
INFORMATION (COI) IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
USING AN ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING<br>
(OFDM) SCHEME"<br>
The invention relates to a method for transmitting by a Mobile Subscriber Station<br>
(MSS) channel quality information (CQI) in a wireless communication system<br>
using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme or an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme, the method<br>
comprising measuring (721) CQI values of a plurality of bands each comprised of<br>
a predetermined number of adjacent subcarriers for a band adaptive modulation<br>
and coding (AMC) operation; generating (722,723) an absolute CQI using the<br>
measured CQI values for at least one of specific bands along with band indexes<br>
of the specific bands; transmitting (724) the absolute CQI to a Base Station (BS);<br>
selecting at least two bands from among all of the bands according to the<br>
absolute CQI; measuring (711) CQI values for the selected bands; generating<br>
(714) a differential CQI by comparing the measured CQI values of the selected<br>
bands with previous CQI values for the selected bands; and transmitting<br>
(716,717) information related to the differential CQI from the MSS to the BS for<br>
the band AMC operation, wherein the absolute CQI is transmitted via a Report-<br>
Response (REP-RSP) message and information released to the differential CQI is<br>
transmitted to a CQI channel.</td>
