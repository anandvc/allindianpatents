				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ADHESIVE SHEET MATERIAL FOR AGING PREVENTION AND METHOD OF<br>
PREVENTING CROSSLINKED RUBBER FROM AGING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive material<br>
for aging prevention and a method of preventing crosslinked<br>
rubber from aging.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
An antidegradant is added to rubber products used<br>
outdoors such as tires, hoses and fenders for the purpose<br>
of preventing them from being deteriorated by exposure to<br>
UV light, ozone or heat.<br>
However, in cases where these rubber products are<br>
used outdoors for a long period of time, the antidegradant<br>
is consumed and reduced with time to deteriorate<br>
crosslinked rubber, as a result of which the crosslinked<br>
rubber will not be able to exhibit the required properties.<br>
[0003]<br>
In order to solve such a problem, there have<br>
conventionally been proposed methods which involve applying<br>
a coating- or solvent-type composition for aging prevention<br>
to the surface of crosslinked rubber to form a film thereby<br><br>
preventing rubber products from being deteriorated.<br>
An example of the coating- or solvent-type<br>
composition for aging prevention includes a coating<br>
composition for preventing aging of rubber materials which<br>
comprises a curable polyurethane and/or a curable silicone,<br>
and also comprises one or more than one antidegradant<br>
selected from the group consisting of aromatic amine<br>
derivatives, phenol derivatives, quinoline derivatives,<br>
dithiocarbamates and imidazoles in an amount of 0.1 wt% to<br>
10 wt% (see Patent Document 1).<br>
[0004]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP 6-172707 A<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
However, such a conventional coating- or solvent-type<br>
composition for aging prevention suffers from the following<br>
problems:<br>
(A)	when used on vertical surface, the composition<br>
runs down;<br>
(B)	the composition contains a solvent and may cause<br>
therefore damage to the surface or discoloration of a<br>
rubber product;<br>
(C)	the composition may cause environmental<br><br>
contamination;<br>
(D)	the composition is not suitable for use in an<br>
enclosed space;<br>
(E)	when the composition is used outdoors, a uniform<br>
coating cannot be formed under the influence of wind and<br>
rain; and<br>
(F)	the coating formed has a relatively small<br>
thickness and therefore the effect lasts only for a short<br>
period of time.<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an adhesive material for aging prevention having<br>
the following effects (a) to (g):<br>
(a)	the antidegradant is allowed to migrate to<br>
crosslinked rubber and the aging resistance of the<br>
crosslinked rubber can be restored;<br>
(b)	the adhesive material for aging prevention can<br>
also be used on surfaces other than horizontal surfaces<br>
(such as on vertical surfaces);<br>
(c)	the adhesive material for aging prevention does<br>
not cause damage to the surface or discoloration of a<br>
rubber product;<br>
(d)	there is no problem of environmental<br>
contamination;<br><br>
(e)	the adhesive material for aging prevention can<br>
also be used in an enclosed space;<br>
(f)	wind and rain hardly affect the adhesive material<br>
for aging prevention used outdoors; and<br>
(g)	aging resistance suitable for the state of a<br>
rubber product can be imparted thereto.<br>
[0007]<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method of preventing crosslinked-rubber aging which has<br>
the effects (a) to (g).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
Next, the present invention is described in further<br>
detail.<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention according<br>
to the present invention (hereinafter referred to simply as<br>
the "adhesive material") includes 100 parts by mass of at<br>
least one polymer ingredient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer and a<br>
resin, and 5 to 50 parts by mass of an antidegradant.<br>
[0012]<br>
The polymer ingredient is not particularly limited as<br>
long as it is at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of a rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer and a<br>
resin. However, the polymer ingredient preferably has<br>
flexibility and adhesion properties, and more preferably<br>
has a glass transition point of up to room temperature<br>
(25°C).<br>
[0013]<br>
The rubber may be crosslinked rubber or non-<br><br>
crosslinked rubber but in general non-crosslinked rubber is<br>
preferred in terms of excellent flexibility and adhesion<br>
properties.<br>
Examples of the non-crosslinked rubber include diene<br>
rubbers such as natural rubber (NR), isoprene rubber (IR),<br>

rubber. These may be used singly or in combination of two<br>
or more.<br>
Of these, natural rubber and isoprene rubber are<br>
preferred in terms of high adhesion properties and good<br>
processability and physical properties.<br>
[0014]<br>
Examples of the crosslinked rubber include those<br>
obtained by vulcanizing the non-crosslinked rubbers. Of<br>
these, natural rubber is preferred.<br>
[0015]<br><br>

include optionally hydrogenated polystyrene elastomeric<br>
polymers (for example, SBS, SIS, and SEBS), polyolefin<br>
elastomeric polymers, polyvinyl chloride elastomeric<br>
polymers, polyurethane elastomeric polymers, polyester<br>
elastomeric polymers, and polyamide elastomeric polymers.<br>
These may be used singly or in combination of two or more.<br>
[0016]<br>
Specific examples of the resin include (meth)acrylic<br>
resins (including esters and vinyl copolymers), ABS resins,<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), polyvinyl<br>
chlorides, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyolefins,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols, and silicone resins. These may be used<br>
singly or in combination of two or more.<br>
[0017]<br>
The molecular weight of the polymer ingredient is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately set according<br>
to the flexibility required for the adhesive material.<br>
[0018]<br>
The antidegradant that may be used in the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited and antidegradants<br>
used in conventionally known rubber compositions may be<br>
employed. Specific examples of the antidegradant that may<br>
be preferably used include a phenol derivative, an aromatic<br><br>
amine derivative, an amine-ketone condensate, a<br>
benzimidazole derivative, a dithiocarbamic acid derivative,<br>
and a thiourea derivative. These may be used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more.<br>
[0019]<br>
Specific examples of the phenol derivative include<br>
styrenated phenol, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 2,6-di-tert-<br>
butylcresol, 4,4'-butylidene-bis(3-methyl-6-tert-<br>
butylphenol), 4,4'-methylene-bis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol),<br>
and 4,4'-thio-bis(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol).<br>
[0020]<br>
Specific examples of the aromatic amine derivative<br>
include 4,4'-bis(α,α-dimethylbenzyl)diphenylamine,<br>
octylated diphenylamine, N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine,<br>

dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine.<br>
[0021]<br>
Specific examples of the amine-ketone condensate<br>
include polymerized 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline,<br>
6-ethoxy-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline, and a<br>
reaction product of diphenylamine and acetone.<br>
[0022]<br>
Specific examples of the benzimidazole derivative<br>
include 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-<br><br>
mercaptomethylbenzimidazole, and a zinc salt of 2-<br>
mercaptobenzimidazole.<br>
[0023]<br>
Specific examples of the dithiocarbamic acid<br>
derivative include nickel diethyldithiocarbamate and nickel<br>
dibutyldithiocarbamate.<br>
[0024]<br>
Specific examples of the thiourea derivative include<br>
1,3-bis(dimethylaminopropyl)-2-thiourea and<br>
tributylthiourea.<br>
[0025]<br>
The antidegradant is incorporated in an amount of 5<br>
to 50 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of<br>
the polymer ingredient. The content of the antidegradant<br>
in the adhesive material of the present invention is set<br>
considerably higher than that in common rubber products, so<br>
that there arises a difference in the concentration of the<br>
antidegradant between the adhesive material and the<br>
crosslinked rubber in cases where the adhesive material is<br>
closely attached to the crosslinked rubber. The<br>
antidegradant has the property of migrating to the lower-<br>
content area, so that at an antidegradant content within<br>
the above-defined range, the antidegradant can easily<br>
migrate from the adhesive material for aging prevention in<br><br>
the present invention to the crosslinked rubber, thus<br>
enabling the aging resistance of the rubber product itself<br>
to be restored.<br>
The antidegradant is preferably incorporated in an<br>
amount of 5 to 30 parts by mass and more preferably 10 to<br>
30 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the<br>
polymer ingredient, because the antidegradant can migrate<br>
at a high rate and in a large amount and impart long-term<br>
aging resistance.<br>
[0026]<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention in the<br>
present invention preferably further contains up to 30<br>
parts by mass of oil with respect to 100 parts by mass of<br>
the polymer ingredient. Inclusion of oil improves the<br>
flexibility of the adhesive material for aging prevention<br>
and also facilitates migration of the antidegradant to the<br>
crosslinked rubber.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the type of oil<br>
and oils used for the softener in conventionally known<br>
rubber products may be employed. Specific examples thereof<br>
include petroleum oil, vegetable oil and synthetic oil.<br>
These may be used singly or in combination of two or more.<br>
[0027]<br>
Specific examples of the petroleum oil include<br><br>
paraffinic oil, naphthenic oil and aromatic oil.<br>
[0028]<br>
The oil is incorporated in an amount of up to 30<br>
parts by mass, preferably 5 to 30 parts by mass, more<br>
preferably 5 to 20 parts by mass and even more preferably 5<br>
 to 15 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of<br>
the polymer ingredient in terms of the flexibility of the<br>
adhesive material for aging prevention and easy migration<br>
of the antidegradant to the crosslinked rubber.<br>
[0029]<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention of the<br>
prevent invention preferably further contains carbon black.<br>
Carbon black serves as a colorant or an extender. The<br>
antidegradant can be incorporated in a large amount in the<br>
adhesive material because carbon black can improve the<br>
dispersibility of the antidegradant.<br>
[0030]<br>
Carbon black is preferably incorporated in an amount<br>
of 3 to 20 parts by mass and more preferably 3 to 10 parts<br>
by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the polymer.<br>
[0031]<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the adhesive material for aging prevention further contains<br>
a tackifier. Specific examples of the tackifier include<br><br>
aromatic hydrocarbon resins, saturated or unsaturated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon resins, terpene resins, and phenol<br>
modified or aromatic modified terpene resins.<br>
[0032]<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention in the<br>
present invention may optionally contain various additives<br>
such as fillers, pigments (dyes), plasticizers, flame<br>
retardants, dispersants, dehydrating agents, and antistatic<br>
agents as long as the objects of the present invention are<br>
not impaired.<br>
[0033]<br>
There is no particular limitation on the form of the<br>
adhesive material for aging prevention in the present<br>
invention as long as it is not liquid and can be applied to<br>
crosslinked rubber. Exemplary forms include a sheet form<br>
(including a film form), a paste form and a pellet form.<br>
Of these, a sheet form is preferred.<br>
[0034]<br>
The size and the thickness of the adhesive material<br>
for aging prevention in the present invention are not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected.<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention in the present<br>
invention has a thickness of preferably 0.5 to 10 mm and<br>
more preferably 1 to 6 mm.<br><br>
[0035]<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the adhesive material for<br>
aging prevention in sheet form has a back-up material<br>
provided on one or both surfaces thereof. The adhesive<br>
material for aging prevention is brought into contact with<br>
the crosslinked rubber on one surface of the adhesive<br>
material and has a back-up material on the other surface of<br>
the adhesive material which is opposite to the surface of<br>
the adhesive material to be brought into contact with the<br>
crosslinked rubber, so that deposition of the antidegradant<br>
on the surface of the adhesive material providing the back-<br>
up material can be suppressed to enable efficient migration<br>
of the antidegradant to the crosslinked rubber. The<br>
adhesive material does not stick to hands by providing the<br>
back-up material on one surface thereof, whereby the ease<br>
of application (workability) can be improved while also<br>
reinforcing the adhesive material.<br>
In cases where the back-up material is provided on<br>
both surfaces of the adhesive material, deposition of the<br>
antidegradant on the surfaces of the adhesive material<br>
before use can be suppressed. In this case, the back-up<br>
material provided on one surface of the adhesive material<br>
can be peeled off to use the adhesive material.<br>
[0036]<br><br>
Specific examples of the back-up material include<br>
plastic films, cloths, paper and fibers.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the present invention, the adhesive material<br>
itself preferably has adhesion properties, but adhesive<br>
members such as a double faced tape and an adhesive may be<br>
used in part or the whole of the surface of the adhesive<br>
material in order to impart adhesion properties.<br>
[0038]<br>
The method of producing the adhesive material of the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited, and for<br>
example a method may be used in which the respective<br>
ingredients (except the back-up material) are thoroughly<br>
kneaded in an agitator such as a Banbury mixer and the<br>
mixture is formed into a specified shape. The ingredients<br>
may optionally be heated upon kneading. The back-up<br>
material may optionally be adhered to the mixture after<br>
formed into a specified shape.<br>
[0039]<br>
As described above, the adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention in the present invention allows the<br>
antidegradant to migrate to the crosslinked rubber, which<br>
may restore the aging resistance of the crosslinked rubber.<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention does not run<br><br>
down and can also be used on surfaces other than horizontal<br>
surfaces (such as on vertical surfaces). The adhesive<br>
material does not use a solvent and therefore damage to the<br>
surface or discoloration of a rubber product does not<br>
occur. The adhesive material contains no solvent and<br>
therefore has no problem of environmental contamination and<br>
can be used even in an enclosed space. Wind and rain<br>
hardly affect the adhesive material used outdoors. Aging<br>
resistance suitable for the state of products can be<br>
imparted by adjusting the thickness of the adhesive<br>
material and the content of the antidegradant or replacing<br>
the adhesive material.<br>
[0040]<br>
The method of preventing crosslinked-rubber aging<br>
according to the present invention (hereinafter referred to<br>
as the "aging prevention method of the present invention")<br>
is described below in detail.<br>
The aging prevention method of the present invention<br>
includes: applying an adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention including at least one polymer ingredient<br>
selected from the group consisting of a rubber, a<br>
thermoplastic elastomer and a resin, and an antidegradant<br>
to a crosslinked rubber to allow the antidegradant to<br>
migrate to the crosslinked rubber, and thereby prevent the<br><br>
crosslinked rubber from aging.<br>
[0041]<br>
The polymer ingredients (rubber, thermoplastic<br>
elastomer and resin) and the antidegradant that may be used<br>
in the aging prevention method of the present invention are<br>
the same as those used in the above-described adhesive<br>
material for aging prevention in the present invention.<br>
The above-described adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention in the present invention is preferably used in<br>
the aging prevention method of the present invention.<br>
[0042]<br>
Examples of the crosslinked rubber to be prevented<br>
from aging in the aging prevention method of the present<br>
invention include diene rubbers crosslinked (vulcanized)<br>
with sulfur, and diene rubbers and non-diene rubbers<br>
crosslinked with peroxides.<br>
[0043]<br>
The adhesive material is applied to a portion of the<br>
surface of the crosslinked rubber to be prevented from<br>
aging, or in the vicinity thereof. In cases where cracking<br>
occurs at the surface of the crosslinked rubber due to<br>
aging, the adhesive material in sheet form is applied to<br>
the surface of the crosslinked rubber so as to cover the<br>
cracked portion in order to suppress the progress of aging<br><br>
at that portion or to restore the aging resistance. The<br>
adhesive material in paste form may be filled into cracks<br>
to be closely attached thereto.<br>
[0044]<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the aging prevention<br>
method of the present invention, an exemplary method<br>
involves applying the adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention in sheet form to the outer surface or inner<br>
surface of a device which is capable of expansion and<br>
contraction, expanding the device and applying the adhesive<br>
material for aging prevention to the crosslinked rubber<br>
with the former closely attached to the latter.<br>
Examples of the device which is capable of expansion<br>
and contraction include balloons and pneumatic fenders.<br>
Balloons and pneumatic fenders are preferred, because they<br>
can be expanded or contracted by increasing or decreasing<br>
the internal pressure and are simple. According to this<br>
method, the adhesive material can be easily applied to<br>
portions such as inner surface of a hose which are not<br>
directly reached by hands.<br>
[0045]<br>
In cases where the device is in a tubular shape or a<br>
doughnut shape, the adhesive material can be applied to the<br>
crosslinked rubber in a closely attached manner by applying<br><br>
the adhesive material to the inner surface of the device<br>
and expanding the device. This method can be<br>
advantageously used in, for example, rod-like rubber<br>
products such as cylindrical fenders.<br>
[0046]<br>
The antidegradant begins to migrate from the adhesive<br>
material to the crosslinked rubber upon application of the<br>
adhesive material to the crosslinked rubber. During the<br>
application of the adhesive material to the crosslinked<br>
rubber, UV light and ozone are blocked by the adhesive<br>
material and cannot directly act on the product, whereby<br>
the service life-prolonging effect is achieved.<br>
[0047]<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention may remain<br>
applied to the crosslinked rubber but, from the viewpoint<br>
that the appearance is not impaired, a preferred method of<br>
use includes peeling off the adhesive material from the<br>
crosslinked rubber after the antidegradant has migrated to<br>
the crosslinked rubber.<br>
The difference in the concentration of the<br>
antidegradant between the adhesive material and the surface<br>
of the crosslinked rubber, and the ambient temperature<br>
affect the rate of migration of the antidegradant and<br>
therefore the period of application time is appropriately<br><br>
set depending on the status of use. It is generally<br>
assumed that the antidegradant can fully migrate in cases<br>
where the adhesive material is applied at 50°C for 1 week.<br>
[0048]<br>
As described above, the aging prevention method of<br>
the present invention allows the antidegradant to migrate<br>
to the crosslinked rubber, which may restore the aging<br>
resistance of the crosslinked rubber. The adhesive<br>
material for aging prevention does not run down and can<br>
also be used on surfaces other than horizontal surfaces<br>
(such as on vertical surfaces). The adhesive material does<br>
not use a solvent and therefore damage to the surface or<br>
discoloration of a rubber product does not occur. The<br>
adhesive material contains no solvent and therefore has no<br>
problem of environmental contamination and can be used even<br>
in an enclosed space. Wind and rain hardly affect the<br>
adhesive material used outdoors. Aging resistance suitable<br>
for the state of products can be imparted by adjusting the<br>
thickness of the adhesive material and the content of the<br>
antidegradant or replacing the adhesive material.<br>
[0049]<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention and the<br>
aging prevention method of the present invention can be<br>
applied to crosslinked rubber products without any<br><br>
particular limitation. In an application example in which<br>
tires are stacked on top of each other and stored, the<br>
surfaces of the tires can be prevented from aging by<br>
sandwiching the adhesive material for aging prevention in<br>
sheet form in the present invention between the adjacent<br>
tires.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0050]<br>
Examples of the present invention are given below by<br>
way of illustration, and not by way of limitation.<br><experiment on migration of antidegradant><br>
1. Sample Preparation<br>
(Example 1)<br>
One hundred parts by mass of non-crosslinked natural<br>
rubber, 5 parts by mass of an antidegradant (N-(1,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine available from<br>
Flexsys), 3 parts by mass of oil (aromatic oil available<br>
from Showa Oil Co., Ltd.) and 5 parts by mass of carbon<br>
black (HTC#100 available from Nippon Steel Chemical Carbon<br>
Co.., Ltd.) were charged into a Banbury mixer, thoroughly<br>
kneaded and formed into a sheet with a thickness of 4 mm to<br>
obtain an adhesive material for aging prevention.<br>
[0051]<br>
(Example 2)<br><br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of<br>
antidegradant added was changed to 10 parts by mass to<br>
thereby obtain an adhesive material for aging prevention in<br>
sheet form.<br>
[0052]<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
Methyl ethyl ketone and an antidegradant (N-(1,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine available from<br>
Flexsys) were mixed at a mass ratio of 7/3 to obtain a<br>
composition for aging prevention.<br>
[0053]<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
A conventional solvent-type composition for aging<br>
prevention (SUPER Anti Crack available from The Yokohama<br>
Rubber Co., Ltd.) and an antidegradant (N-(1,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine available from<br>
Flexsys) were mixed at a mass ratio of 9/1 to obtain a<br>
composition for aging prevention.<br>
[0054]<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
A modified rubber solvent (available from Nisseki<br>
Mitsubishi Co., Ltd.) was added to the adhesive material<br>
for aging prevention in sheet form in Example 2 at a mass<br>
ratio (of the adhesive material to the solvent) of 1/9.<br><br>
The mixture was thoroughly mixed to dissolve the adhesive<br>
material in the solvent to thereby obtain a composition for<br>
aging prevention.<br>
[0055]<br>
The resulting adhesive materials for aging prevention<br>
in Examples 1 and 2 and compositions for aging prevention<br>
in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were subjected to<br>
measurement of the amount of migration of the antidegradant<br>
to the crosslinked rubber (vulcanized rubber) according to<br>
the following method.<br>
[0056]<br>
2. Migration Experiment<br>
A sheet (150 × 100 × 2 mm) formed from a natural<br>
rubber for use in fenders (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"rubber sheet for fenders") was extracted with acetone to<br>
remove the compounding ingredients contained in the rubber<br>
sheet for fenders.<br>
Then, in Examples 1 and 2, each adhesive material for<br>
aging prevention was applied to the surface of the rubber<br>
sheet for fenders from which the compounding ingredients<br>
had been removed. In Comparative Examples 1 to 3, each<br>
composition for aging prevention was applied once with a<br>
brush on the surface of the rubber sheet for fenders from<br>
which the compounding ingredients had been removed, thereby<br><br>
forming a film with a thickness of 0.2 mm. Then, each<br>
rubber sheet for fenders was heated in an oven at 50°C for<br>
1 week.<br>
Thereafter, the adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention or the composition for aging prevention was<br>
peeled off from the vulcanized rubber sheet. Two layers<br>
each having a thickness of 0.5 mm were sliced off from the<br>
side of the surface of the vulcanized rubber sheet (to<br>
which the adhesive material or the composition had been<br>
applied) to obtain a first-layer sample and a second-layer<br>
sample from the surface side.<br>
The thus obtained first-layer and second-layer<br>
samples were extracted with 100 ml of acetone for 48 hours<br>
using a Soxhlet extractor (according to JIS K6229) to<br>
determine the ratio of the contents of the antidegradant<br>
and oil having migrated to the whole sample (amount of<br>
extraction into acetone).<br>
Quantitative analysis of the antidegradant having<br>
migrated to the sample was performed by gas chromatography<br>
to determine the ratio of the content of the antidegradant<br>
to the whole sample (the amount of migration of the<br>
antidegradant).<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0057]<br><br><br>
[0058]<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Table 1, the<br>
adhesive materials for aging prevention in Examples 1 and 2<br>
allowed the antidegradant to migrate in larger amounts than<br>
the compositions for aging prevention in Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 3.<br>
[0059]<br><evaluation of aging resistance><br>
1. Sample Preparation<br>
(Comparative Example 4)<br>
A dumbbell specimen (JIS dumbbell No. 3) was blanked<br>
out from the rubber sheet for fenders (150 × 100 × 2 mm)<br>
and used as Sample 1.<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
A dumbbell specimen (JIS dumbbell No. 3) was blanked<br><br>
out from the rubber sheet for fenders (150 × 100 × 2 mm)<br>
from which the compounding ingredients had been removed by<br>
extraction with acetone, and used as Sample 2.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
The adhesive material for aging prevention in Example<br>
1 was applied to the surface of the rubber sheet for<br>
fenders (150 × 100 × 2 mm) from which the compounding<br>
ingredients had been removed by extraction with acetone and<br>
the rubber sheet was heated in a geer oven at 50°C for 1<br>
week. Then, the adhesive material for aging prevention was<br>
peeled off from the rubber sheet, and a dumbbell specimen<br>
(JIS dumbbell No. 3) was blanked out from the rubber sheet<br>
and used as Sample 3.<br>
[0060]<br>
2. Tensile Test<br>
The tensile strength (TB) [MPa] and the breaking<br>
elongation (EB) [%] of Samples 1 to 3 were measured<br>
according to JIS K6251-2004.<br>
Samples 1 to 3 were put in the geer oven at 80°C and<br>
aged for 120 hours or 240 hours, and the tensile strength<br>
(TB) [MPa] and the breaking elongation (EB) [%] of these<br>
samples were measured in the same manner.<br>
From the obtained results, the tensile strength<br>
retention rate [100 × TB after aging / TB before aging (%)]<br><br>
and the breaking elongation retention rate [100 × EB after<br>
aging / EB before aging (%)] were determined.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0061]<br><br>
[0062]<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Table 2, Sample<br>
2 (in Comparative Example 5) from which the antidegradant<br>
had been removed by extraction with acetone had a low<br>
retention rate due to a considerable decrease in the<br>
tensile strength after aging.<br>
On the other hand, it has been revealed that in<br>
Sample 3 (of Example 3) in which the antidegradant was<br>
allowed to migrate to the rubber sheet by applying the<br>
inventive adhesive material for aging prevention to the<br><br>
rubber sheet (corresponding to Sample 2) from which the<br>
antidegradant had been removed by extraction with acetone,<br>
the tensile strength and breaking elongation after aging<br>
decrease less than in Comparative Example 5 and the aging<br>
resistance can be restored. The tensile strength retention<br>
rate and the breaking elongation retention rate were<br>
equivalent to or higher than those in Comparative Example 4<br>
and it has been therefore revealed that products from which<br>
the aging resistance has been lost can have the aging<br>
resistance at a level equal to or higher than the initial<br>
level by using the inventive adhesive material for aging<br>
prevention, and that aging resistance suitable for the<br>
state of products such as fenders may be imparted thereto.<br><br>
