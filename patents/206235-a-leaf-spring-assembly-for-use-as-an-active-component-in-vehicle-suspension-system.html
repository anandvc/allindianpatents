LEAF  SPRING    ASSEMBLY    IIAVINQ    FULL—LEAF LEAF SPRING<br>
COMPONENT AND HALF LEAF LEAF SPRING COMPONENT"	<br>
A LEAF SPRING ASSEMBLY FOR USE AS AN ACTIVE <br>
COMPONENT IN VEHICLE SOSPENSION SYSTEM.<br>
THE BOLER COMPANY, of 500 Park Boulevard, Itasca, Illinois 60143, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a leaf spring assembly for use as an active component in vehicle suspension systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to active components for suspension systems, and more particularly, to springs for such systems.<br>
A basic object of any suspension system in a vehicle is to suspend the vehicle faodyabove the vehicle wheels. To achieve this end, suspension systems are typically connected between the axle, or its housing, and the vehicle frame. Suspension systems typically include active components, such as springs and the like, to keep the sprung mass (vehicle body) suspended above the unsprung mass (vehicle wheels). A suspension system preferably permits a relatively smooth, yet stable, ride during acceleration, deceleration and cornering of the vehicle, and during jounce and rebound of the axle when the vehicle is driven over bumpy surfaces and the like.<br>
In suspension system, leaf springs often serve as the active components. In a variety of circumstances, concerns regarding vehicle packaging necessitate the use of an asymmetrical leaf spring. In asymmetrical leaf springs, one cantilever of the leaf spring is longer than the other cantilever. For instance, and referring to FIG. 1, in a typical asymmetrical leaf spring 10, the front cantilever 12 (i.e., that portion of the leaf spring extending from one end 14 of the leaf spring to the center 16 of the axle seat portion 17) might be longer than the rear cantilever 18 (i.e., that portion of the leaf sprhqj extending from the center 16 of the axle seat portion 17 to the opposite end ofthe leaf spring 20). This difference in length between cantilevers is what classifies a leaf spring as asymmetrical.<br>
Ordinarily, leaf springs in general, including asymmetrical leaf springs, are designed such that they have the same stress level in each cantilever. In the case of asymmetrical leaf springs, thU optimized design results in the shorter cantilever being stiffer than the longer cantilever. Stated differently, the shorter cantilever has a higher spring rate than the longer cantilever.<br><br>

WO 01/69103	PCT/US01M0I70<br>
Conversely, the longer cantilever is softer than the shorter cantilever, and it has a lower spring rate. Given this optimized design, during deflection of the leaf spring (e.g., during jounce and rebound of the vehicle axle), the seat portion 16 of the spring translates vertically and rotates due to the differing spring rates of the respective cantilevers. This rotation of the seat portion, in turn, applies torsion to the axle and causes it to rotate, producing a varying caster angle during vehicle movement. Those skilled in the art understand that this varying caster angle is sometimes undesirable, and can serve as a drawback of asymmetrical leaf springs designed for optimum stress tolerances. Nevertheless, vehicle packaging concerns and trie like often necessitate use of such asymmetrical leaf springs.<br>
In light of these deficiencies of stress tolerant asyixanetricalleafsprings, it b desirable to design an asymmetrical leaf spring that has cantilevers with substantially equal spring rates so that the axle has constant caster during jounce and rebound.<br>
When packaging concerns are not present, it is oft^ desirable to use synimetrical leaf springs, such as the symmetrical leaf spring 22 shown in FIG. 2. In such springs, the front and rear cantilevers 24,26 are substantially equal in length. When optmiized for rnaidnnjm stress tolerance, the cantilevers not only have equal stress levels, but also have equal spring rates to yield the equal stress levels. la such leaf springs, the seat portion does not rotate during spring deflection and the axle of associated with the spring maintains a constant caster angle during jounce and rebound.<br>
Although constant caster is often desirable, in sonie instance Varying castar is optimal Those skilled in the art will recognize that in trailing arm suspensions varying caster is often desirable in those instances when the axle, or its housing, is geaerslh resistant to tcision. In those cases, by varying the caster angle of the axle during jounc* and rebound, roUstab&amp;ty for the vehicle is increased. Thaere, the iise of auxiliary roll stabilizers might be unnecessary.<br><br>
Elimination there of reduces the cost and weight associated with those suspension systerms.<br><br>
             In light of the aforementioned deficiencies of stress tolerant symmetrical leaf springs, it is<br><br>

desirable to design a symmetrical leaf spring that has cantilevers with substantially different spring rates so that the axle has varying caster during jounce and rebound.<br>
As will  be appreciated by those skilled in the art, vehicles often optimally have a biased, fixed caster for each of its axles. Different axles often have different desirable biased, fixed caster angles. In conventional suspension systems, and referring to FIG. 3, a caster wedge 28 is often positioned between the axle seat of the leaf spring and the axle to provide for the selected, fixed caster angle of the axle.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional suspension system used for a front steering axle 30. As shown therein, a vehicle frame 32 extends longitudinally and is suspended above axle 30 by a suspension system generally identified by reference numeral 34. The suspension system 34 includes a leaf spring 36 pivotaify connected at one end to a hanger 38, which, in turn is fixedly mounted to frame 32. At its other end, leaf spring 36 is prvotally connected to a hanger 40 through a conventional shackle 42. Hanger 40 is mounted to frame 32. An air spring 44 is optionally mounted at its top side to an air spring mounting bracket 46, which is fixedly mounted to frame 32. Air spring 44 is seated on an axle attachment assembly 48 in alignment with axle 30. The axle attachment assembly 48 includes a pair of guide plates 50,52 positioned on opposite sides of axle 30, the caster wedge 28, and a pair of U-bolts 54, 56 to fasten the assembly components together.<br>
Caster wedge 28 causes axle 30 to rotate a fixed amount of degrees (either clockwise or counter-clockwise, depending on the orientation of the caster wedge) to accommodate the desired fixed caster angle for the axle. Use of extra suspension system components, such as caster wedge 28, adds weigh* to the suspension system and increases the costs associated with the design, assembly and service of such systems.<br>
In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to design suspension system components, particularly leaf springs, that provide for the desired fixed caster angle of a vehicle axle.<br>
As an object of the present invention, it is desirable to produce an optimally designed<br>

asymmetrical leaf spring that maintains a constant caster angle for its associated axle during jounce and rebound.<br>
As another object, it is desirable to produce an optimally designed symmetrical leaf spring that produces a varying caster angle for its associated axle during jounce and rebound.<br>
It is also desirable to reduce the expense associated with suspension systems used in vehicles.<br>
It is further desirable to eliminate die necessity of including additional components in such suspension systems.<br>
It is yet further desirable to design a leaf spring having buflt-in features to produce a select biased caster angle for its associated axle.<br>
These and other objects of the preferred forms of the invention wul become apparent from the following description. It will be understood, however, that an apparatus could soil appropriste the invention claimed herein whlxiutacccim^ishmg each and every one of these objects, including those gleaned from the following description. The appended claims, not the objects, define the subject matter of this invention. Any and all objects are derived from the preferred forms of the invention, not necessaiiry the mvenricflm general.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a leaf sprmg assembly for use as an active component in vehicle suspension systems. The leaf spring assembly includes a full leaf leaf spring component and a half leaf leaf spring component. The full leaf kef spring extends substaariauy the entire length of the leaf spring assembly and the half leaf le^spring extends substarjtiaBy the entire length ofone of the cantilevers. The half leaf leaf spring preferably also extends along the axcle seat portion of the other cantilever and terminates at the end of the axie seat portion included within the other cantilever. The full leaf leaf spring and the half leaf leaf spring are preferably<br><br>

connected together by a fastener.<br>
In a preferred form, when the leaf spring assembly has front and rear cantilevers of subsiantialiy unequal length, the half leaf leaf spring extends substantially along the entire length of the shorter cantilever to soften that cantilever. Undo- such draunstances, the leaf spring assembly preferably has relatively uniform stress tolerance and provider for a constant caster angle for its associated axle during deflection of the assembly due to jounce and rebound.<br>
In another preferred form, when the leaf spring assembly has from and rear cantilevers of substantially equal length, the half leaf leaf spring softens the cantilever along which it extends. Under these circumstances, the leaf spring assembly preferably has relatively uniform stress tolerance and provides for a varying caster angle for its associated axle during deflection of the assembly due to jounce and rebound.<br>
In yet another preferred form, the axle seat portion of the ftiU leaf leaf spring is designed such that it biases the position of die axle associated with the leaf spring assembly to a predetermined caster angle. In that regard, one of the upper and lower surfaces of the full leaf leaf spring, most preferably the lower surface, tapers throughout the axle seat portion in such a manner that the full leaf leaf spring is thicker at one end of its axle seat portion than it is at the other end of its axle seat portion. In particular, throughout the axle seat portion, the upper and lower surfaces of the full leaf leaf spring extend in intersecting planes. As such, the full leaf leaf spring, and therefore the leaf spring assembly, includes a built-in caster wedge that biases its associated axle to a predetermined caster angle.

The full leaf leaf spring component 63A (FIG. 4), 63B (HG. 6) has an upper surface 61A (FIG. 4), 61B (FIG. 6) and a lower surface 62A (HG. 4% 62B (FIG. 6). In HG. 4, the distance between upper surface 61A and lower surface 62A through axle seat portion 70 is not uniform. In particular, tower surface 62A tapers as it extends through axle seat portkra 70 and, in effect, establishes a buUt-in caster angle feature, for the leafspring assembly 60 srwwn in FIG. 4. On the other hand, in FIG. 6, the distance between upper surface 61B and lower surface 62B through axle seat portion 70 is uniform so that the leaf spring assembly 60 shown in FIG. 6 has no built-in caster angle feature.<br>
The full leaf leaf spring component 62 includes eyes 74, 76 at opposite ends thereof.	Eyes<br>
74,76 are used for attachment to hangers, shackles or sinito stroctuies m vehicle suspension systems (see FIG. S). The halfleaf leaf spring component 64 iiicludes a wrap 77 at its front end. Wrap 77 provides an additional safety feature to kce^tlieeoniiectknhitaet even under the unlikely condition wherein eye 74 breaks. Half leafleaf spring component 64 preferably extends along the substantial entire length of front cantilever 66 and through the axle seat portion 70, preferably terminating at the end of the axte seat portkjnwMim rear cantiever 69. Full leaf leaf spring component 62 and half leaf leaf spring cciimonem 64 are fastened together by a fastener 78, preferably positioned so that it is aligened with the centerpoint 72 of axle seat portion 70. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that this umr^e construction of leaf assembly 60 permits an asymtnetrical leaf spring designed for maximum stress tolerence to function as a conventional symmetrical leaf srmng likewise designed for maximum stress tolerance. In p&amp;rtkxilar, the half leaf spring compoent 64 softens the cantileverthough<br>
which it extends (front cantilever 66 in fig.4 giving it a lower spring rate. Under these circumstances, the design of leaf spring assembly 60 can be opthraaed so trurt, when assent a suspension system, the axle associated with the teaf spring maintains a constant caster angle<br>

during deflection of the leaf spring due to jounce and rebound.<br>
When it is symmetrical, however, the leaf spring can function as a conventional asymmetrical leaf spring. Again, the half leaf leaf spring component 64 softens the cantilever through which it extends (front cantilever 66 in FIG. 4^ giving it a lower spring rate. Under these circumstances, the design of leaf spring assembly 60 can be ciptinuzed so that, when assembled in a suspension system, the caster angle of the associated axle is changed throughout its jounce and rebound movement.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, the leaf spring assembly 79 shown therein is designed Hke the one shown in FIG. 4. Accordingly, it includes a full leaf leaf spring component 80 having an upper surface 82 and a lower surface 84. The distance between upper surface 82 and lower surface 84 at any given point of full leaf leaf spring component 80 defines the thickness of the component at that given point. For the leaf spring assembly 79 shown in FIG. 5, through its axle seat portion 70, the upper surface 82 and lower surface 84 of full leaf leaf spring component 80 extend in nonparattel (ie., intersecting) planes. In the embodiment shown, upper surface 82 extends substantially flat through axle seat portico 70, whik lower surface 84 hnearfy tapers in a manner such that full leaf leaf spring component 80 b thicker at the rear end ofthe axle seat portion than it is at the front end ofthe axle seat portion. Asa result of this construction, when assembled, leaf spring assembly 79 biases its associated axle so that his positioned at a predetermined caster angle. In effect, the portion of full leaf leaf spring component 80 extending through axle seat portion 70 serves as a built-in caster wedge for leafspring assembly 79.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the use ofleaf spring assembly 79 in a suspension system. A longitudinally extending vehicle frame 86 is suspended above an axle 88 by a vehicle suspension system generally designated by reference numeral 90. The suspension system includes leafspring<br>

assembly 79, which is pivotally connected at its proximal end to a hanger 92, which, in turn, is fixedly mounted to frame 86. Leaf spring assembly 79 is also connected at its distal end to a hanger 94 through a conventional shackle 96, which permits movement of the distal end of the leaf spring assembly. Ranger 94 is fixedly mounted to frame 86.<br>
An air spring 98 is mounted atop an axte attachment assembly 100. The air spring is . mounted to frame 86 by an atr spring mounting bracket 1(32.<br>
Leaf spring attacrmiertt assembly includes an upper guide plate 104, a lower guide plate 106 and two U-bolts 108,110. The U-bolts 108,110 are used to fasten the leaf spring assembly 79 to the axle 88. Using the leaf spring assembly shown in FIG. 4 biases axle 88 in a position wherein it has a predetermined biased caster angle. If leaf spring assembly 79 functions like a symmetrical leaf spring; then die biased caster angle reniains coastam airing jouna and rerjc«nd. If leaf spring assembly 79 functions like an asyrrmietrical leaf spring, then the biased caster angle wfll vary duringjounce and rebound. As explained above, die unique design of leaf spring assembly 79 permits it to establish a predetermined biased caster angle for its associated axle, and permits varying spring rates in die cantilevers of die leaf spring assembly.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a leaf spring assembly 160 having a full leaf leaf spring component 162 and a haJfJeafleafspring component 164. The leaf spring assembly 160 is in a form similar to a tapered convolute leaf spring, which serves the subject matter for U.S. Patent No. 5,938,221, issued to Wilson, d»e disclosure of which is hereby incorpomed herein by reference. The leaf spring assembly 160 Is divided into a from cantilever portion 166 and a rear cantilever portion 168. An axle seat portion 170 extends dirough a rnid^ection of leaf spring assembly 160.

The M leaf leaf spring component 162 includes an eye 174 «t cine of its ends. Eye 174 is<br>
used for attachment to hangers, shackles or similar structures in vehicle suspension systems (see<br>
FIG. 9). The half leaf leaf spring component 164 includes a wrap 177 at the same end as eye 174.<br>
Wrap 177 provides an additional safety feature to keep the connection intact even under the uniikdy condition wherein eye 174 breaks. Half leaf leaf spring component 164 preferably extends along the substantial entire length of front cantilever 166 and through the axle seat portion 170, preferably terminating at the end of the axle seat portion within rear cantilever 168. FuU leaf leaf spring component 162 and half leaf leaf spring component 164 axe fastened together by a fastener 178, preferably positioned so that it is aligned whit the centerpoim 172 of axle seat portion 170.<br>
It win be understood by those drilled in the art that this unio^ ccnstrwric* of leaf spring assembly 160 permits an asymmetrical leaf spring designed for maximum stress tolerance to function as a conventional symmetrical leaf spring likewise designed for maximum stress tolerance. In particular, the half leaf leaf spring component 164 softens the cantilever through which it extends (front cantilever 166 in FIG. 7), giving tta lower spring rate. Under these circumstances, the design of leaf spring assembiy 160 can be optimized so that, when assembled in a suspension system, the axle associated with the leafspiingnjaintaim a constant caster angle during deflection of the leaf spring due to jounce and rebound<br>

these circumstances, the design of leaf spring assembly 160 can be optimized so that, when assembled in a suspension system, the caster angle of the assodated arfe is danged throughout its jounce and rebound movement<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8, the leaf spring assembly 179 shown therem includes a full leaf leaf spring component 180 having an upper siirfiK» 182 and a lower surfece 184. The distance between upper surface 182 and lower surface 184 at any given point of fill} leaf leaf spring component 180 defines the thickness of the compete* at that given point For the leaf spring assembly 179 shown in FIG. 8, through its axle seat portion 170, the upper surface 182 and tower surface 184 of full leaf leaf spring component 180 extend in ncnparaUel (ie., intersecting) planes. In the embodiment shown, upper surface 182 extends substantially flat through axle teat portion 170, while lower surface 184 linearly tapers in a nianaersi»ch that ftjU leaf leaf spring component 180 is thicker at the rear end of the axle seat portion than it is at the from end cfthe axle seat portion. As a result of this construction, when assembled, leaf spring assembly 179 buses its associated axle so that it is positioned at a predetermined caster angle. In effect, the portion of full leaf leaf spring component 180 extending through axle seat portion 170 serves as a built-in caster wedge for leaf spring assembly 179.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates the leaf spring assembly 179 shown in FIG. 8, as incorporated in a suspension system 186. For reference to the suspension system 186, reference will be made to dw aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,938,221. It will be noted that the distal end of leaf spring assembly 179 is connected to its associated frame hanger vw an attachment member 188, which is fUrther disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,887,881, issued to Hatch, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In lieu of attachment member 188, a different attachment member could be used, preferably one consmictcd in accordance with the principles of the<br>
