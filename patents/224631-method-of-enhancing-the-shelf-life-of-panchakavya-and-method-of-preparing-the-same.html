Field of Invention<br>
This invention pertains to patient search in the herbal kingdom to get a product to enhance shelf life of panchakavya.<br>
Panchakavya is extensively researched and also used as a tool in organic farming. Synthetic pesticides are slowly being phased out and natural pesticides are slowly entering in the field of agricultural / horticultural. On my part I have tired solanum xanthocarpum, cynadon doctylon, tridex trocumbence, prosopis julifolora extract and used and studied the shelf life. All have failed.<br>
Again in the search I have tired cyces quadrangularis, hemidermus indicus, wallichi and hemitonenous indicus. Cyces quadrangularis was slightly useful but gave not more than 1 week shelf life. The ingredients buttermilk, curd in the products which are to be tackled for shelf life. Hemidermus indicus gave an amazing good shelf life upto 2 years. The experiment started in 1997 ended with good result by 2003 and confirmed our requirement.<br>
So far none is able to bottle and sell panchakavya for agriculturist. In addition to shelf life hemidermus indicus is able to prevent pest also when we use panchakavya as pesticide with hemidermus the pesticidal effects in enhanced.<br>
This product enabled to merchandise panchakavya as packaged<br>
The foregoing description outlined rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed<br><br>
conception and specific embodiment as a basic for designing and modifying other structure for carrying out the same purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
With regard to the drawback of associated with known art this invention completely eliminates chemical and pesticide, fungicide, amino acids, hormones and enzymes. This composition possess additional benefits like growth promoters, quality improvement, resistant inducement, quality product etc. Derived form animal product (fauna) and with a preservative from plant (flora) kingdom is being able to control pests safe in all respects which the ingredients vouch safe. The scientific preparation additionally assures safety in all respects.<br>
Objects of Invention<br>
It is the primary object of invention to find out a product to enhance shelf life of a multipurpose, broad spectrum, non-chemical functional as pesticide, fungicide, hormone, amino acid, proteins all in panchakavya and with preservative phyto chemical to act on all fronts and since totally organic and no toxic, no residue in end product.<br>
This invention will revolutionize "ORGANIC FARMING" and also economize cultivation expenses since hormone, amino acid, bacillus and enzymes are present making redundant scores of products containing amino acids, hormone, bacteria and enzyme. There are separate products for every above bio-chemical products. Hence the objective is to have one product for organic forming ie., pachakavya and<br><br>
increasing shelf life will allowing pab and sell in the shop. At present it is made and used immediately.<br>
Further the invention constitute a correct balance of raw material and Herbal preservative to give 2 years of shelf life which is a real invention and with the propositions there under.<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail in the following description of complete specification. The nature of the invention and the manner in which the invention is performed will be clearly described in the complete specification.<br>
