DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring, now to Figure 1. there is shown, schematically, a fluid flow control<br>
device, referred to generally as 10, in accordance with a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention A magnetic membrane 11 is located opposite an array of<br>
electromagnets 12. The array may be linear, as in Figure 1, or planar. Electric power<br>
from the power supply 14 is distributed among the electromagnets of the array 12 by<br>
a controller and driver unit 13 so as to create varying magnetic fields 15 which<br>
produce a desired wavelike, dynamic, deformation of the membrane 11'. When the<br>
membrane is placed within or adjacent to a fluid flow conduit with fluid flowing therein,<br>
as shown by arrows 16, the deformation will cause a corresponding variation in the<br>
fluid flow characteristic. The use of a plurality of electromagnets 12 and the electronic<br>
control thereof to produce electromagnetic fields 15 acting on the membrane element<br>
11 which directly affects the fluid flow, provides high resolution and real time control<br>
thereof.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show block diagrams of examples of controller and driver<br>
circuits, respectively, which together may constitute controller and driver unit 13<br>
shown in Figure 1. These circuits, as will be understood by persons skilled in the art,<br>
are operative to distribute power to the electromagnets of the array to create the<br>
aforementioned varying magnetic fields.<br>
As will be understood by persons skilled in the art, magnetic membrane 11 can<br>
have a number of alternative configurations. These may be, in alternative<br>
embodiments of the invention, by way of example, any of the following:<br>
•	a single membrane made of a flexible magnetic material, such as polyethylene<br>
impregnated with iron filings or with nickel<br>
•	a compound membrane having joined magnetic and non-ma gnet ic layers wherein<br>
the magnetic layer transfers forces resulting from its deformation as described<br>
above to the non-magnetic layer<br>
•	a single non-magnetic membrane having magnetic elements embedded therein<br>
•	a single non-magnetic membrane having magnetic elements attached to its surface<br>
It will be further understood by persons skilled in the art that such magnetic elements<br>
may be permanent magnets or other magnetic material.<br><br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, shown schematically in<br>
Figure 2, a second array of electromagnets 27 similar to the first array 22, is located<br>
opposite the magnetic membrane 21. The use of an additional array provides<br>
enhanced spatial and temporal response in the magnetic membrane 21 with resulting<br>
enhanced control of the flow of the fluid in the conduit.<br>
As will be understood by persons skilled in the art, the more discrete locations<br>
whereat electromagnetic fields can be applied to the magnetic membrane, the greater<br>
is the resolution of the control over the deformation thereof.<br>
Referring now to Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C, there is shown, in isometric,<br>
side-sectional, and cross-sectional views, respectively, an integrated fluid flow conduit<br>
and electromagnetic flow control apparatus, constructed in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a plurality of<br>
arrays of electromagnets 32 are arranged cylindrically around a fluid flow conduit 31<br>
whose walls are made of magnetic material. Figure 3C shows the cross-sectional view<br>
of the conduit 31 when it is fully open. Figures 4A and 4B, show the conduit 31 when<br>
it is partially closed and fully closed, respectively, as a result of the application of<br>
suitable magnetic fields via the arrays of electromagnets.<br>
The spatial resolution of the control of the deformation of the fluid flow conduit,<br>
together with the time resolution of the control provided by electronic control of the<br>
individual electromagnets allows such embodiments of the present invention to impart<br>
a wavelike motion to fluid flows along the conduit 31 along its length, as indicated by<br>
11' and 21' in Figures 1 and 2 respectively, so as to drive the flow fluid though the<br>
conduit in a peristaltic-like fashion.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5A, 5B, and 5C, there is shown an alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention wherein an integrated fluid flow conduit and<br>
electromagnetic flow control apparatus additionally includes a rod 53 running<br>
longitudinally in the center of the fluid flow conduit 51. Rod 53 is supported by any<br>
suitable mounting elements (not shown). When the magnetic elements 52 are<br>
activated to close the fluid flow conduit 51, as shown in Figure 5C, the magnetic<br>
membrane wall of the conduit 51 presses against the rod 53, thereby providing a<br>
firmer seal to close the conduit to fluid flow. In accordance with a further embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the rod 53 may be made of magnetic material in order to<br>
enhance the magnetic force for closing the fluid flow in the conduit 51.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, an electromagnetic<br>
flow control apparatus 62 is employed in conjunction with an existing fluid flow conduit<br>
61, as shown in Figures 6A and 6B. In this embodiment of the invention, an<br>
electromagnetic flow control apparatus 62, including a magnetic membrane 63, is a<br>
sleeve-like construction that is placed around a segment of an existing fluid flow<br>
conduit 61. The deformation of the magnetic membrane 6:3 in response to the<br>
magnetic fields produced by the apparatus 62 presses on the conduit to control the<br>
fluid flow therein. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the electromagnetic<br>
flow control apparatus 62 may include a. gas-filled cell 65 separating the magnetic<br>
membrane 63 from the fluid flow conduit 61 to provide a cushion to protect the conduit<br>
from excessive forces.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is<br>
