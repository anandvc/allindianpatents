				<td>METHOD AND DEVICES FOR SUPPORTING A FLEXIBLE HANDLING OF CONNECTIONS TOWARDS A DUAL MODE MOBILE STATION<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to method and devices for handling a call involving a dual mode<br>
mobile station, i.e. a mobile station adapted to communicate via a first cellular access<br>
network and via a second access network.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
Dual mode phones capable of communicating via GSM and CDMA or GSM and DECT<br>
networks are available for some time, already. However, dual mode phones supporting for<br>
example GSM and Bluetooth, or W-LAN, or other short range radio systems, fixed network<br>
access, infrared access or optical network access may already exist, but methods and devices<br>
for supporting call handling for both of the modes are not widespread, yet.<br>
In recent years the percentage of household having a broadband connection at home was<br>
increasing. Today 11% of the households in Germany are equipped with a broadband<br>
connection (mainly ADSL). In Sweden the percentage is already 22% (50% ADSL, 50 %<br>
other technologies). It is expected that these percentages will increase significantly over the<br>
next years. Many of these users will install private WLAN(Wireless Local Area Network-<br>
access points to connect their PCs (Personal Computers), PDA (Personal Digital Assistants),<br>
mobile phones etc. to their fixed broadband connection.<br>
Furthermore, it is expected that the number of public WLAN-hot spots in Europe will<br>
increase from approx. 18.000 (2003) to 36.000 (2009).<br>
Parallel, to the increased number of broadband connections the users are starting to use IP<br>
(Internet Protocol) telephony over their WLAN-broadband connection via PCs and PDAs. In<br>
the next years mobile phone vendors will launch so-called GSM/WLAN dual mode phones<br>
(e.g. Nokia 2005).<br>
For these users of the GSM/WLAN dual mode phones it will be quite easy to originate calls<br>
via the SIP-client over the WLAN-radio interface towards other SIP-clients connected to the<br>
same network or even to the internet.<br>
Today several architectures - such as the one disclosed in US 2004/0105434 Al - are<br>
proposed how to integrate cellular networks with WLAN-access points. The main focus is the<br>
integration of the WLAN-access point towards the packet switching network.<br><br>
For example Mobile @home proposes an architecture where the WLAN-access point is<br>
connected via a broadband connection to the BSC. The disadvantage of this solution is that<br>
the same operator has to supply the cellular mobile network and the broadband connection.<br>
Furthermore, Mobile @home proposes a solution based on the ADSL (Asymmetric Digital<br>
Subscriber Line) technology.<br>
Therefore it is object of the invention to provide methods and devices that support a more<br>
flexible handling of connections towards a dual mode mobile station.<br>
[Summary]<br>
This will be solved advantageously by the method of claim 1, the mobile station of claim 3,<br>
and the node of claim 4. Further advantageous embodiments can be derived from the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The invention introduces a method for connecting a mobile station with a cellular<br>
telecommunications network, wherein the cellular telecommunications network comprises a<br>
core network and a first cellular access network. The core network is connected to a second<br>
access network via at least one node operating according to a session initiation protocol. The<br>
method comprises the following steps performed by the at least one node operating according<br>
to the session initiation protocol, receiving a request for registering the mobile station at the<br>
at least one node, registering the mobile station at the at least one node, receiving a request<br>
for registering the mobile station with the cellular telecommunications network, wherein the<br>
request is sent in at least one session initiation part message comprising a message according<br>
to a protocol used between the first cellular access network and the core network, unpacking<br>
the message according to the protocol used between the first cellular access network and the<br>
core network, and forwarding the message according to the protocol used between the first<br>
cellular access network and the core network to a control node of the cellular<br>
telecommunications network.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises the additional step of determining a<br>
control node as receiver of the unpacked message.<br>
The invention further provides a mobile station for communicating via a cellular<br>
telecommunications network. The mobile station comprises a first part operating according to<br>
at least one protocol used between a mobile station and a core network of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network, a second part operating according to a session initiation<br><br>
protocol, and a connecting unit operating according to one of a short range radio protocol, a<br>
fixed network protocol, an optical network protocol, or an infrared connection protocol.<br>
Also object of the invention is to provide a node for connecting a core network of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network to an access network, wherein the access network operates<br>
according to a session initiation protocol. The node acts towards the core network like a<br>
cellular access network node and towards the access network like a session initiation protocol<br>
proximity server.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the node further comprises an unpacking unit for<br>
unpacking a message according to a protocol used between an access network and a core<br>
network of a cellular telecommunications network, from at least one message according to<br>
the session initiation protocol and a packing unit for including a message according to a<br>
protocol used between an access network and a core network of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network into at least one message according to the session initiation<br>
protocol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the first access network is one of a wireless local are<br>
network, a bluetooth network, a short range radio network, a fixed network, or an optical<br>
network.<br>
It is a basic concept of the invention that the master call control, i.e. the control of all calls<br>
that are received via a network that is not connected to the second access network, is handled<br>
in the core network of the cellular telecommunications network. Furthermore the location<br>
management of the mobile station is handled in the cellular network as well. Location<br>
management and call control in the second access network is done either on behalf of the<br>
cellular telecommunications network or for calls that are received from a further party in the<br>
second access network.<br>

[Detailed Description]<br>
In the following the invention will be further described by means of examples and by means<br>
of figures.<br>
It should be noted that the WLAN access is just an exemplary embodiment and could be<br>
replaced by any other access technology as for example Bluetooth, optical connection, short<br>
range radio or fixed line connection. In particular access technology with lower costs on or a<br>
higher value of transmission resources like bandwidth than the cellular telecommunications<br>
access network can be used advantageously for the second access network. The cellular<br>
telecommunications network may be operating according to any standard of for example<br>
PDC (Personal Digital Cellular), AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone Service), D-AMPS<br>
(Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service), WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple<br>
Access) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).<br>
Figure 1 depicts an architecture for enabling a mobile station 101 to access a<br>
telecommunications network 113, 114, 115, 110 via the second access network 102, 103,<br>
104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110. The telecommunications network comprises a home location<br>
register 114, a gateway mobile services switching centre 115, a mobile services switching<br>
centrell3 and a combined base station controller/session initiation protocol proxy 110<br>
(proximity server), which are connected to each other. The combined base station controller/<br>
SIP proxy 110 may also be regarded as external to the cellular telecommunications network,<br>
which depends just on the point of view and does not influence the invented solution. The<br>
combined base station controller/ SIP proxy does not have to support full base station<br>
controller functionality, but performs the actions of a base station controller at least to the<br>
extent that it is able to support the interface used between an mobile services switching centre<br>
and a base station controller. As the invention is not limited to GSM, the combined base<br>
station controller/ SIP proxy may be a combination of the respective access network node and<br>
a SIP proxy, that supports the interface used between the respective call control node and<br><br>
cellular telecommunications access network node. In an embodiment of the invention the<br>
base station controller and the SIP proxy are not combined in a single node but connected to<br>
each other.<br>
The combined base station controller/SIP proxy 110 is located in an internet domain 109<br>
comprising and a second SIP proxy 111 that is connected to telephone 112 adapted to send<br>
signals according to SIP.<br>
The internet domain is connected via an ISP (Internet Service Provider) 108 and a DSLAM<br>
(Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) 107 to a local exchange 105 which is connected<br>
to a public switched telephony network 106.<br>
The local exchange is further connected via a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) modem 104 to a<br>
WLAN-access Point 103. The mobile station 101 is connected via a WLAN radio connection<br>
102 to the WLAN Access Point 103. The mobile station comprises a first part operating<br>
according to protocols compliant to GSM standards, a second part operating according to a<br>
session initiation protocol, and a connecting unit operating according to W-LAN protocol.<br>
According to the invention, the mobile station 101 uses the WLAN radio connection 102 to<br>
register in the first SIP proxy 110. To that end the mobile station 101 may send a SIP register<br>
message towards the SIP proxy 110 via the WLAN radio connection. After successful<br>
registration the SIP proxy can return a 200 OK message to the mobile station.<br>
The mobile station registers with the cellular telecommunications network as depicted in<br>
figure la by sending a message in a first step 116 via the second access network to the base<br>
station controller/SIP proxy 110. The message is compliant to a protocol used between the<br>
mobile station and a control node of the cellular telecommunications network, for example a<br>
DTAP (Direct Transfer Application Part) location update message. The message is sent<br>
within at least one SIP message.<br>
In a next step 117 the base station controller/SIP proxy 110 receives the message, unpacks it<br>
from the at least one SIP message and forwards it to call control node, the mobile services<br>
switching centre 113 via a standard interface between base station controller and mobile<br>
services switching centre. The mobile services switching centre 113 receives the message,<br>
updates entries in a database for storing subscriber data like the home location register 114<br>
and a visitor location register (not depicted) and returns an acknowledgement message in a<br><br>
succeeding step 118. The base station controller/SIP proxy 110 receives the message over the<br>
interface, packs it into at least one SIP message and sends it towards the mobile station 101<br>
via the second access network in a step 119. The messages sent between the base station<br>
controller/SIP proxy 110 and the mobile station do not necessarily have to comply to SIP but<br>
may be sent according to any other protocol used with the second access network for<br>
transmitting messages.<br>
Figure 1 does not depict a connection towards the mobile station via a cellular<br>
telecommunications access network. This is due to the fact that according to the invention<br>
such connection is not used and may even be not available, for example because it has been<br>
deactivated in the mobile phone or due to lack of coverage or lack of capacity. Such lack of<br>
coverage may occur because no devices have been installed, inside buildings or tunnels, or at<br>
points of temporary high demand like at trade fairs, sports stadiums and alike.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the base station controller/SIP proxy 110 determines the<br>
mobile services switching centre by means of a table, wherein mobile services switching<br>
centre are assigned to location information of the mobile station. Such location information<br>
may be for example an identity of a W-LAN access point, a location area identity or<br>
geographical co-ordinates. The contents of the tale may be configured by means of a<br>
management interface. However, there may also be a fixed relation between the second<br>
access network and the mobile services switching centre.<br>
It is the basic idea of the invention that the base station controller/SIP proxy 110 acts towards<br>
the cellular telecommunications network like a node of such network and towards the second<br>
access network like a node supporting protocols used in the second access network. The base<br>
station controller/SIP proxy 110 tunnels messages received from the cellular<br>
telecommunications network through the second access network, for example messages<br>
according to 3GPP standard 24.008 version 6.6.0 of September 2004.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a connection set-up according to the invention. Figure 2 depicts the<br>
architecture as described for figure 1. In a first step 201 the gateway mobile services<br>
switching centre 115 receives a call request. It interrogates the home location register 114 for<br>
routing information in a step 202. The home location register receives the request looks up<br>
which mobile services switching centre is currently serving the mobile station 101 and<br>
requests a MSRN (Mobile Station Roaming Number) from the mobile services switching<br><br>
centre 113 in a step 203. The mobile services switching centre checks with its visitor location<br>
register (not depicted) that the mobile station is currently located with the service area of the<br>
mobile services switching centre and returns a MSRN in a step 204. The home location<br>
register forwards the MSRN together with an address of the mobile services switching centre<br>
in a step 205. The steps 201 to 205 are state of the art and reflect in a simplified way the usual<br>
procedure for setting-up a call towards a subscriber served by an access network of the<br>
cellular telecommunications network.<br>
For the invented solution, the mobile services switching centre does not necessarily have the<br>
information that the mobile station is served by the second access network. It may as well<br>
operate exactly as if the mobile station was served by a node of the cellular<br>
telecommunications access network. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mobile<br>
services switching centre stores an indication that the mobile station is served by the second<br>
access network. Said indication can be for example an indication that the location area of the<br>
mobile station is associated with, belongs to, or identifies the second access network, an<br>
identity of the base station controller associated with the information that it co-operates with<br>
or belongs to the second access network.<br>
The mobile services switching centre 113 receives a call request message from the gateway<br>
mobile services switching centre 115 in a step 206. It performs usual call set-up towards the<br>
base station controller serving the location area that is stored for the mobile station for<br>
example in a visitor location register (not depicted). In this case that is the base station<br>
controller/SIP proxy 110. The base station controller/SIP proxy 110 acts like a base station<br>
controller towards the mobile services switching centre at least to the extent that it receives<br>
call set-up related DTAP messages compliant to 3GPP 24.008 and relays them piggybacked<br>
on SIP messages via W-LAN access to the mobile station and vice versa receives call set-up<br>
messages from the mobile station by means of SIP messages, unpacks the call set-up<br>
messages from said SIP messages and relays them to the mobile services switching centre.<br>
For the invented solution it is not relevant whether the call set-up messages are transported as<br>
SIP messages or as messages according to any other protocol used with the second access<br>
network.<br>
The call set-up messages are terminated, processed and a response is produced if appropriate<br>
in the circuit switched client of the mobile station 101.<br><br>
Figure 3 depicts a SIP call according to the invention in the architecture as described for<br>
figure 1. It should be noted that the architecture of figure 1 is just one possible embodiment<br>
of an architecture supporting the invented solution. The call has been set-up from the<br>
telephone operating according to a session initiation protocol 112 via the second SIP proxy<br>
111, the DSLAM 107, the local exchange 105, the DSL modem 104, the WLAN-access Point<br>
103 and the WLAN radio connection 102 to the mobile station 101. More precisely it is set-<br>
up via a WLAN radio module providing radio access facilities of the mobile station to a SIP<br>
client that is adapted to run IP Multimedia Subsystem protocols, as defined by 3GPP, of the<br>
mobile station. The depicted call has been set-up independent from the call control of the<br>
cellular telecommunications network and is thus one of the exceptions to the master call<br>
control principle as described above.<br>
Figure 4 depicts a mobile station MS4 according to the invention. The mobile station<br>
comprises a first part 1STP operating according to at least one protocol used between a<br>
mobile station and a core network of a cellular telecommunications network, a second part<br>
operating 2NDP according to a session initiation protocol, and a connecting unit CU4<br>
operating according to one of a short range radio protocol, a fixed network protocol, an<br>
optical network protocol, or an infrared connection protocol. The first part 1STP can be for<br>
example a circuit switched client according to cellular network specifications, e.g. compliant<br>
to PDC, AMPS, D-AMPS, WCDMA, or CDMA. The second part can be for example be a<br>
SIP client adapted to run IP Multimedia Subsystem related protocols as for example defined<br>
by 3GPP. The connecting unit can be implemented for example by a WLAN radio module, a<br>
bluetooth transceiver, a short range radio unit, each of them providing radio access facilities;<br>
an optical input output unit as for example an infrared interface, or a fixed network input<br>
output unit. The units and parts can be implemented by means of software, hardware or a<br>
combination of both.<br>
Figure 5 depicts a node according to the invention. The node is adapted to act towards a core<br>
network of a cellular telecommunications network like a cellular access network node and<br>
towards the second access network like a session initiation protocol proximity server. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention the node N5 comprises an input output unit IOU5, for sending<br>
and receiving messages, an unpacking unit UU5 for unpacking a message according to a<br>
protocol used between an access network and a core network of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network, from at least one message according to the session initiation<br><br>
protocol and a packing unit PU5 for including a message according to a protocol used<br>
between an access network and a core network of a cellular telecommunications network into<br>
at least one message according to the session initiation protocol. It further comprises a control<br>
unit for controlling the other units and for operating towards a control node of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network like node of an associated cellular telecommunications access<br>
network node and towards the second access network like a SIP proxy. The node does not<br>
have to support full base station controller functionality, but performs the actions of a base<br>
station controller at least to the extent that it is able to support the interface used between an<br>
mobile services switching centre and a base station controller. As the invention is not limited<br>
to GSM, the node may be a combination of an respective cellular telecommunications access<br>
network (UTRAN, GERAN, D-AMPS, AMPS, PDC, CDMA) node and a SIP proxy, that<br>
supports the interface used between the respective call control node and cellular<br>
telecommunications access network node. The session initiation protocol may also be<br>
replaced or supplemented by any other protocol used for sending messages in the second<br>
access network. The units can be implemented by means of software, hardware or a<br>
combination of both.<br>
Figure 6 depicts a method according to the invention. The method is used for connecting a<br>
mobile station with a cellular telecommunications network via the second access network.<br>
The method comprises the following steps performed by a node operating according to the<br>
session initiation protocol, for example the base station controller/SIP proxy introduces in<br>
figure 1.<br>
In a first step 601 the method is started. In a next step 602 the node receives a request for<br>
registering the mobile station at the at least one node, it registers the mobile station in a step<br>
603, receives a request for registering the mobile station with the cellular telecommunications<br>
network in a step 604, wherein the request is sent in at least one session initiation part<br>
message comprising a message according to a protocol used between the first cellular access<br>
network and the core network.<br>
The node unpacks the message in a step 605, and forwards the message according to the<br>
protocol used between the first cellular access network and the core network to a control node<br>
of the cellular telecommunications network in a step 606.<br>
The request for registering may be sent from the mobile station after the connection unit<br>
CU5, for example a WLAN radio unit, detects WLAN coverage. It will then request<br><br>
registration and if it is authorised will get it. The registration request may be according to the<br>
known SIP registration procedure.<br><br>

wherein a message according to a protocol used between the access network and<br>
the core network of a cellular telecommunications network is included.<br>
4. Node (N5, 110) for connecting a core network of a cellular telecommunications<br>
network to an access network, wherein the access network operates according to a<br>
session initiation protocol, characterised by that the node acts towards the core network<br>
like a cellular access network node and towards the access network like a session<br>
initiation protocol proximity server, further characterized by that the node comprises<br>
•	means for receiving (IOU5) a request for registering the mobile station with the<br>
cellular telecommunications network, wherein the request is sent in at least one<br>
session initiation part message comprising a message according to a protocol used<br>
between the cellular access network and the core network,<br>
•	an unpacking unit (UU5) for unpacking the message according to the protocol<br>
used between the first cellular access network and the core network, and<br>
•	a packing unit (PU5) for including a message according to a protocol used<br>
between the access network and the core network of a cellular<br>
telecommunications network into at least one message according to the session<br>
initiation protocol.<br><br><br>
METHOD AND DEVICES FOR SUPPORTING A FLEXIBLE HANDLING OF CONNECTIONS TOWARDS A DUAL MODE MOBILE STATION<br>
The invention relates to a method and devices for supporting the use of a dual mode mobile<br>
station (101) in a cellular telecommunications network connected to a first cellular<br>
telecommunications access network and a second short range and/or high bandwidth access<br>
network. The node connecting the second access network (102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109,<br>
110) and the core network imitates a node of the cellular telecommunications access network<br>
towards a core network and operates towards the second access network like a SIP proxy<br>
(111).<br></td>
