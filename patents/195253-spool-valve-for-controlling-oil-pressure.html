				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a spool valve for controlling oil pressure, and more particularly, to a spooi valve for controlling oil pressure adapted to dispense with a separate mold manufacturing when the design of the valve is altered, and to prevent leakage between a valve body and a valve spool, thereby improving control performance of the oil pressure.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Generally, a spool valve comprises a valve body formed with a chamber connecting to a plurality of ports for supplying oil pressure from one side to the other side according to the supply of controlled oil pressure. A vaive spool is inserted into the chamber of the valve body, which comprises a plurality of lands and grooves formed between the lands. When the vaive spool is axially moved by the oil pressure control, oil pressure is supplied or stopped from one port to the other port by the movement of the valve spool.<br>
Oil flow supplied from one port to the other port thus described passes through the groove formed between the lands.<br>
However there is a problem in the valve body of the spool valve for controlling oil pressure thus described in that the valve body is processed in aluminum casting such that a new design of the moid is required in order to reconfigure the interval between ports or areas of the ports.<br>
There is still another problem in that oil leakage occurs between the valve body and vaive spool which causes the control performance of the valve to decrease because the valve body is made of aluminum while the valve spool is made of carbon steei the two different metals generate volumetric changes in<br>
response to temperature variation of the Automatic Transmission Fluid (A If ).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a spool valve for controlling oil pressure adapted to dispense with a separate mold manufacturing when the design of the valve is altered, and to prevent leakage between a valve body and a valve spool, thereby improving control performance of the oil pressure<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a spool valve for controlling oil pressure, the valve comprising<br>
a valve body (10) having a plurality of ports (10 a,b&amp;c) and a body<br>
chamber (11) connected to the ports.<br>
a valve body  socket (20)  inserted into the body  chamber (II) and<br>
comprising a plurality of ports (20 a. b &amp; c) connected to the ports (10 a,<br>
b &amp; c) at the valve body respectively and a socket chamber (21) connected<br>
to the ports and<br>
a valve spool movably inserted into the socket chamber and comprising a<br>
plurality of lands (31  a.b &amp; c) disposed at a predetermined gap and<br>
grooves (32 a, b &amp; c) formed between the lands for selectively connecting<br>
one port to the other port at the valve bodv (10) via the socket chamber<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, the spool valve for controlling oil pressure according to the present invention includes a valve body 10, a valve body socket 20 fixedly inserted into the valve body 10 and a valve spool 30 mounted inside the valve body socket 20<br>
The valve body 10 is further comprised of an inlet port 10a into which oil pressure is introduced (A), and outlet ports 10b and 10c from which the oil pressure supplied from the inlet port 10a is discharged (B)<br>
The valve body 10 is not only limited to formation of the inlet port 10a and outlet ports IOb and 10c but also includes all other formation of a plurality of inlet ports and outlet ports performing the aforesaid actions.<br>
The valve body 10 is formed at one lateral surface thereof with a body chamber 11 having a cylindrical shape in cross-sectional view, to be connected to the inlet port 10a and the outlet ports 10b and 10c.<br>
The valve body socket 20, which is cylindrical, is forcibly fitted into the body chamber 11 of the valve body 10. The valve body socket 20 is also formed with a plurality of ports 20a, 20b and 20c at a circumferential area opposite to the ports 10a, 10b and 10c disposed at the valve body 10 The valve body socket 20 is formed with a socket chamber 21 therein which is connected to the ports 20a, 20b and 20c and into which tne valve spool 30 is inserted<br>
The socket chamber 21 is formed at one side thereof with a control port 20' where oil pressure is suppliec (C), and is also formed with guide portions 22a, 22b and 22c connecting each gapped portions of the ports 20a, 20b and<br>
20c at the valve body socket 20, thereby guiding an easy sliding movement of the valve spool 30<br>
The valve spool 30, inserted into the socket chamber 21 of the valve body socket 20, slides horizontally depending on the oil pressure. The valve spool 30 is also formed with a plurality of lands 31a, 31b and 31c in order to supply oil pressure provided from one side to the other side. Grooves 32a and 32b are formed between the lands.<br>
The valve body socket 20 is made of the same material as the valve spool 30 such that the volumetric change therebetween in response to temperature variations are identical.<br>
By way of example, the valve body socket 20 is made of carbon steel, the same material as the valve spool 30.<br>
A resilient member 40 is disposed at a side opposite to the side where the oil pressure is provided in the socket chamber 21 such that the valve spool 30 slides horizontally by mutual action and reaction. The resilient member 40 can be formed by a round coil spring 41.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the spool valve for controlling oil pressure according to the present invention will be described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, when the valve spool 30 is axiaiiy moved by oil pressure supplied to the control port 20' of the valve body socket 20, the oil pressure supplied to the nlet ports 10a and 20a at the valve body socket 20 and the valve body 10 passes through the grooves 32a and 32b of the valve spool 30 to be discharged through the outlet ports 10b, 10c, 20b and 20c at the valve body socket 20 and the valve body 10.<br>
If  it is the designer's intention to alter the gaps between the ports and<br>
the size of the ports in the valve body 10, only the processing design of the valve body socket 20 needs to be changed, and then the valve spool 30 and the round coil spring 41 are inserted into the socket chamber 21 and the valve body socket 20 is push-fitted into the body chamber 11. The designer's intention can be accomplished by merely changing the design of the valve body socket 20 without manufacturing a new mold to the valve body 10.<br>
Because the guide portions 22a, 22b and 22c are formed between the ports 20a, 20b and 20c of the valve body socket 20, the valve spooi 30 is easily guided by the guide portions 22a, 22b and 22c, to prevent the valve spool 30 from being stuck.<br>
The valve body socket 20 is made of the same carbon steel as that of the valve spool 30 to allow volumetric changes in response to temperature variations to be identical, such that leakage between the valve body 10 and valve spool 30 can be prevented.<br>
The valve body socket 20 is push-fitted into the valve body 10, thereby dispensing with separate mounting parts to the valve spool 30 such as stoppers and the like, and sliding is made possible in the entire region where the valve spool 30 is moved by the guide portions of the valve body socket 20, thereby eliminating any separate sleeves.<br>
The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings.
