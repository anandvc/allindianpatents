				<td>homopolymer fraction and a high molecular weight ethylene copolymer<br>
fraction.<br>
Such multimodal polyethylene resins are known to have good process-<br>
ability and a good ESCR/stiffness relation. However, for moulding<br>
applications, in particular for blow moulding, there is a still a need for<br>
polyethylene compositions having improved ESCR and, at the same time,<br>
good stiffness, i.e. having an optimised ESCR/stiffness relation.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a polyethylene<br>
composition with an improved ESCR/stiffness relation. Furthermore, it is<br>
an object of the invention that the composition at the same time has good<br>
further mechanical properties, such as long-term stability and low swell,<br>
and good processability.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that such a composition must<br>
contain a fraction, usually from 1 to 20 wt%, of a copolymer of ethylene<br>
with one or more types of alpha-olefin comonomers which has a<br>
comparatively high molecular weight, usually above 500,000 g/mol.<br>
The present invention thus provides a polyethylene composition wherein<br>
(i) the composition has an MFR2 of 0.05 to 100 g/10min, and<br>
(ii) the environmental stress crack resistance ESCR measured<br>
according to the full notch creep test (FNCT) at 12 MPa and<br>
23°C in hours and the E-modulus EM measured according to<br>
ISO 527-2:1993 in MPa satisfy the following relation:<br><br>
The polyethylene composition according to the invention has improved<br>
mechanical properties including an improved ESCR/stiffness relation. The<br><br>
E-modulus is a measure for the stiffness. In particular, the composition has<br>
an increased ESCR while maintaining e.g. good stiffness and low swell.<br>
Preferably, the ESCR and the EM of the composition satisfy the reaction:<br><br>
further preferred:<br><br>
most preferred:<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, in the polyethylene composition<br>
(iii) the ESCR measured according to the FNCT at 12 MPa and<br>
23°C in hours and the MFR2 measured in g/10min satisfy the<br>
following relation:<br><br>
In this preferred embodiment, also the relation between ESCR and MFR2 is<br>
optimised.<br>
Preferably, ESCR and MFR2 satisfy the relation:<br><br>
more preferably:<br><br><br>
most preferred:<br><br>
Preferably, the polyethylene composition has a melt flow rate MFR2 of at<br>
least 0.1 g/10min, more preferably at least 0.13 g/10min, even more<br>

Furthermore, the composition preferably has an MFR2 of 10 g/10min or<br>
less, more preferably 5 g/10min or less, still more preferably 3 g/10 min or<br>
less, and most preferably 2 g/10min or less.<br>
Still further, preferably the polyethylene composition has an ESCR<br>
measured according to the FNCT at 12 MPa and 23 °C of 60 h or more,<br>
more preferably of 70 h or more, still more preferably of 100 h or more,<br>
and most preferably of 150 h or more.<br>
Preferably, the composition has an E-modulus EM of 1100 MPa or higher,<br>
more preferably of 1150 MPa or higher.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polyethylene composition comprises<br>
(A) a fraction of a copolymer of ethylene with one or more<br>
alpha-olefins, with a weight average molecular weight Mw of<br>
500,000 g/mol or more.<br>
Where ever the term "molecular weight" is used herein, the weight average<br>
molecular weight is meant. By ethylene copolymer is meant a polymer the<br>
majority by weight of which, i.e. more than 50 wt%, derives from ethylene<br>
monomer units.<br>
Preferably, the molecular weight Mw of fraction (A) is 600,000 g/mol or<br>
more. Usually, Mw of fraction (A) is 2,000,000 g/mol or below, more<br><br>
preferably 1,500,000 g/mol or below, and most preferably 1,200,000 g/mol<br>
or below.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that fraction (A) has a molecular weight<br>
distribution Mw/Mn of 4 or higher, more preferably of 5 or higher.<br>
Still further, it is preferred that fraction (A) has a molecular weight<br>
distribution Mw/Mn of 15 or lower, more preferably of 10 or lower.<br>
The comonomer contribution in fraction (A) preferably is up to 20 mol%,<br>
more preferably up to 10 mol%, still more preferably up to 6 mol% and<br>
most preferably up to 4 mol%.<br>
Furthermore, the comonomer contribution preferably is 0.05 mol% or more,<br>
more preferably is 0.5 mol% or more, and still more preferably is 1.0 mol%<br>
or more.<br>
Preferably, the alpha olefin comonomer is a C3-20, especially C3-10,<br>
comonomers, particularly singly or multiply ethylenically unsaturated<br>
comonomers, in particular C3-10 alpha-olefins such as propene, but-1-ene,<br>
hex-1-ene, oct-1-ene, 4-methyl-pent-l-ene etc.. Preferably, but-1-ene, hex-<br>
1-ene and oct-1-ene are used. But-1-ene is an especially preferred<br>
comonomer.<br>
Fraction (A) preferably is present in the polyethylene composition in an<br>
amount of from 1 to 15 wt%, more preferred from 2 to 10 wt%.<br>
Furthermore, the density of fraction (A) preferably is 930 kg/m3 or less,<br>
more preferably is 928 kg/m3 or less, and most preferably is 926 kg/m3 or<br>
less.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polyethylene composition comprises<br><br>
(B)	a first ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br>
(C)	a second ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction,<br>
which are different from fraction (A), and wherein fraction (B) has a lower<br>
average molecular weight than fraction (C).<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights and<br>
molecular weight distributions for the fractions, is referred to as<br>
"multimodal". Accordingly, in this sense the compositions of the invention<br>
are multimodal polyethylenes. The prefix "multi" relates to the number of<br>
different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of. Thus, for<br>
example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called<br>
"bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each<br>
reactor, the polymer fractions produced in the different reactors will each<br>
have their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular<br>
weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is<br>
recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into<br>
the molecular weight distribution curve for the total resulting polymer<br>
product, usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br><br>
Preferably, the weight fraction of fraction (B) with regard to the total<br>
weight of fractions (B) and (C) is more than 35 %, more preferably is more<br>
than 40%, still more preferably is more than 41 % and most preferably is<br>
more than 42%.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the weight fraction of fraction (B) with regard to<br>
the total weight of fractions (B) and (C) is less than 65 %, more preferably<br>

of at least 2, more preferably at least 2.5. Preferably, Mw of fraction (A)<br>
relative to the Mw of fractions (B) and (C) is higher by a factor of at most<br>
6, more preferably of at most 5.<br>

Furthermore, fraction (B) preferably has an MFR2 of 2000 g/10min or<br>
lower, more preferably of 1500 g/10min or lower, still more preferably of<br>
1000 g/10min or lower, and most preferably of 800 g/10min or lower.<br>
Fractions (B) and (C) may both be ethylene copolymers or ethylene<br>
homopolymers, although preferably at least one of the fractions is an<br>
ethylene copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises an ethylene homopolymer and an<br>
ethylene copolymer component.<br><br>
Preferably, fraction (B) is an ethylene homo- or copolymer with a density<br>
of at least 965 kg/m3.<br>
Where one of the components is an ethylene homopolymer, this is<br>
preferably the component with the lower molecular weight, i.e. fraction<br>
(B). However, also component (C) can be an ethylene homopolymer.<br>
Preferably, fraction (C) is an ethylene homo- or copolymer with a density<br>
of less than 970 kg/m3, more preferably of less than 965 kg/m3.<br>
Most preferably, fraction (C) is a copolymer. It may be noted that the term<br>
ethylene copolymer is used herein to relate to a polyethylene deriving from<br>
ethylene and one or more copolymerisable comonomers. Preferably, the<br>
copolymer component(s) of the composition of the invention will contain at<br>
least 0.01 mol%, more preferably at least 0.05 mol%, and most preferably<br>
at least 0.1 mol % of non-ethylene comonomer units. Furthermore,<br>
preferably the copolymer contains at most 5 mol % of such comonomer<br>
units, more preferably at most 2 mol%.<br>
Preferred ethylene copolymers employ alpha-olefins (e.g. C3-12 alpha-<br>
olefins) as comonomers. Examples of suitable alpha-olefins include but-1-<br>
ene, hex-1-ene and oct-1-ene. But-1-ene is an especially preferred<br>
comonomer.<br>
Furthermore, the composition preferably has a SHI(2.7/210) of 20 or more.<br>

Usually, the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (23°C) of up to<br>
10 kJ/m2, more preferably up to 15 kJ/m2, and most preferably of up to 20<br>
kJ/m2.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (-<br>
20°C) of 3 kJ/m2 or more, more preferably of 3.5 kJ/m2.<br>
Usually, the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (-20°C) of up to<br>

Furthermore, preferably, the polyethylene composition has a die swell rate<br>
of 1.8 or lower, more preferably of 1.7 or lower.<br>
The polyethylene composition may also contain minor quantities of<br>
additives such as pigments, nucleating agents, antistatic agents, fillers,<br>
antioxidants, processing aids, etc., generally in amounts of up to 10 % by<br>
weight, preferably up to 5 % by weight.<br>
Fraction (A) of the polyethylene composition may be produced in any<br>
conventional ethylene homo- or copolymerisation method, e.g. in gas<br>
phase, slurry phase, liquid (bulk) phase using conventional reactors, such<br>
as loop reactor, gas phase reactor, semi-batch or batch reactor.<br>
Preferably, fraction (A) is produced in a slurry reaction, preferably in a<br>
loop reactor, or in a gas phase reaction.<br><br>
The polyethylene composition of the invention may be produced by<br>
blending fraction (A) with a polyethylene base resin, either mechanically,<br>
e.g. by in-line compounding, or in-situ.<br>
By "in-situ blending", production of a multimodal polymer is meant<br>
wherein the fractions are produced either simultaneously in one reaction<br>
stage (e.g. by using two different catalysts), and/or are produced in a<br>
multistage process. A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation<br>
process in which a polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced<br>
by producing each or at least two polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction<br>
stage, usually with different reaction conditions in each stage, in the<br>
presence of the reaction product of the previous stage which comprises a<br>
polymerisation catalyst. The polymerisation reactions used in each stage<br>
may involve conventional ethylene homopolymerisation or<br>
copolymerisation reactions, e.g. gas-phase, slurry phase, liquid phase<br>
polymerisations, using conventional reactors, e.g. loop reactors, gas phase<br>
reactors, stirred tank reactors, batch reactors etc. (see for example<br>
W097/44371 and W096/18662).<br>
In the preferred embodiment wherein the composition comprises fractions<br>
(A), (B) and (C), it is preferred that fractions (A), (B) and/or (C) are<br>
produced in a multistage reaction.<br>
Further in one preferred embodiment, the composition is produced so that<br>
at least one of fractions (B) and (C), preferably (C), is produced in a gas-<br>
phase reaction.<br>
Further preferred, one of the fractions (B) and (C) of the polyethylene<br>
composition, preferably fraction (B), is produced in a slurry reaction,<br><br>
preferably in a loop reactor, and one of the fractions (B) and (C), preferably<br>
fraction (C), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, components (B) and (C) are<br>
produced in two stirred tank reactors.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that fractions (B) and (C) of the polyethylene<br>
resin are produced in different stages of a multistage process. Further, it is<br>
preferred that also fraction (A) is produced in a stage of said multistage<br>
process.<br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in<br>
which, preferably, fraction (C) is produced.<br>
It is also possible to produce components (A) and (C) or (A) and (B),<br>
preferably (A) and (C) in the same reaction stage, preferably in a gas phase<br>
reaction, by adding a second catalyst to said reaction stage with high Mw<br>
capability and appropriate comonomer incorporation capability.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (C) is produced in a subsequent stage in the<br>
presence of fraction (B) which has been produced in a previous stage. Still<br>
further, it is preferred that fraction (A) is produced in a stage preceding the<br>
stages in which fraction (B) and (C) are produced.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, olefin<br>
polymers, such as multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process<br>
comprising two or more reactors connected in series. As instance of this<br>
prior art, mention may be made of EP 517 868, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by way of reference in its entirety, including all its preferred<br>
embodiments as described therein, as a preferred multistage process for the<br>
production of the polyethylene resin.<br><br>
The polymerisation catalysts include coordination catalysts of a transition<br>
metal, such as Ziegler-Natta (ZN), metallocenes, non-metallocenes, Cr-<br>
catalysts etc. The catalyst may be supported, e.g. with conventional<br>
supports including silica, Al-containing supports and magnesium dichloride<br>
based supports. Preferably the catalyst is a ZN catalyst.<br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst further preferably comprises a group 4 (group<br>
numbering according to new IUPAC system) metal compound, preferably<br>
titanium, magnesium dichloride and aluminium.<br>
In the production of the resin, preferably a compounding step is applied,<br>
wherein the composition of the base resin, i.e. the blend, which is typically<br>
obtained as a base resin powder from the reactor, is extruded in an extruder<br>
and then pelletised to polymer pellets in a manner known in the art.<br>
Optionally, additives or other polymer components can be added to the<br>
composition during the compounding step in the amount as described<br>
above. Preferably, the composition of the invention obtained from the<br>
reactor is compounded in the extruder together with additives in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
The present invention further concerns a blow moulded article comprising<br>
the polyethylene composition as described hereinbefore, a process for<br>
preparing the blow moulded article which comprises blow moulding of the<br>
composition into an article, and to the use of the polyethylene composition<br>
for blow moulding.<br>
Experimental and Examples<br>
1. Definitions and measurement methods<br><br>
a)	Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was<br>
used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Howings constant K: 9.54*10-5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92*10"4<br>
and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness<br>
of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end of the<br>
"population".<br>
b)	Density<br>
All densities are measured according to ISO 1183/D.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190°C and<br>
may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2), 5 kg<br>
(MFR5)or21.6kg(MFR2,).<br><br>
d) Shear Thinning Index SHI<br>
Dynamic Theological measurements were carried out with a rheometer,<br>
namely Rheometrics RDA-II QC, on compression moulded samples under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at 190 °C using 25 mm diameter plates and plate<br>
geometry 1.2 mm gap. The oscillatory shear experiments were done within<br>
the linear viscosity range of strain at frequencies from 0.05 to 300 rad/s<br>
(ISO 6721-1).<br>
The values of storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G") complex modulus<br>
(G*) and complex viscosity (eta*) were obtained as a function of frequency<br>
(omega). Eta(100 rad/s) is used as abbreviation for the complex viscosity at<br>
100 rad/sec shear rate.<br>
Shear thinning index (SHI), which is correlating with MWD and is<br>
independent of Mw, was calculated according to Heino ("Rheological<br>
characterization of polyethylene fractions" Heino, EX., Lehtinen, A.,<br>
Tanner J., Seppala, J., Neste Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Theor. Appl. Rheol.,<br>
Proc. Int. Congr. Rheol, 11th (1992), 1, 360-362, and "The influence of<br>
molecular structure on some rheological properties of polyethylene",<br>
Heino, EX., Borealis Polymers Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Annual Transactions<br>
of the Nordic Rheology Society, 1995.)<br>
SHI value is obtained by calculating the complex viscosities eta(2.7) and<br>
eta(210) at a constant shear stress of 2.7 kPa and 210 kPa, respectively. The<br>
shear thinning index SHI(2.7/210) is defined as the ratio of the two<br>
viscosities eta(2.7)and eta(210)-<br>
The definitions and measurement conditions are also described in detail on<br>
page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br><br>
e)	Charpy impact strength<br>
Charpy impact strength was determined according to ISO 179:2000 on V-<br>
notched samples at 23 °C (Charpy impact strength (23°C)) and -20 °C<br>
(Charpy impact strength (-20°C)) on compression moulded samples<br>
multipurpose type B (ISO 3167), with a thickness of 4 mm. Average<br>
cooling rate was 15 K/min (ISO 1872-2).<br>
f)	Die swell rate<br>
Die swell rate was measured at an extrudate length of 5 cm and the infrared<br>
camera is measuring the extrudate 3.2 cm under the die on a RH10<br>
Advanced Capillary Rheometer from Malvern according to ISO 11443:<br>
1995 at 190°C. The piston diameter was 12 mm and the piston speed<br>
2mm/min. The die diameter was 1 mm and the die length 5 mm. The die<br>
inlet temperature was 180°C, and the preheating was 10 minutes.<br>
g)	ESCR<br>
ESCR was measured according to the full notch creep test method (FNCT)<br>
according to ISO/DIS 16770.3 at 23 °C and 12 MPa stress with a notch<br>
depth of 1 mm and specimen dimensions 123 mm x 6 mm x 20 mm. The<br>
solvent used was 2 vol% Igepal CO-630 in deionized water. Compression<br>
moulded samples.<br>
h) Stiffness<br>
As a measure for the stiffness, the E-modulus of the compositions was<br>
measured on compression moulded samples according to ISO 527-2:1993.<br>
E-modulus (tensile modulus) was measured at a speed of 1 mm/min.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a polyethylene composition having an<br>
improved stress crack resistance/stiffness relation, which in particular is<br>
suited for blow moulding applications, a process for blow moulding the<br>
polyethylene composition into an article, an article comprising the<br>
polyethylene composition, and to the use of the composition for blow<br>
moulding.<br>
Polyethylene is widely used for the production of blow moulded articles,<br>
such as household industrial chemical (HIC) containers, due to its good<br>
mechanical properties including low inherent weight, high mechanical<br>
strength, high environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR), chemical<br>
resistance, long-term stability and its good processability. Typical<br>
examples for HIC applications include containers for washing-up liquid,<br>
detergent, cosmetics and automotive chemicals.<br>
Amongst the above-mentioned properties, in particular high ESCR and,<br>
simultaneously, high stiffness are desirable. However, these properties are<br>
contradictory at least in part because, for example, it is known that ESCR<br>
improves with decreasing density whereas stiffness improves with<br>
increasing density. Furthermore, a low swell of the composition when blow<br>
moulded is desirable.<br>
WO 01/23446 describes a polyethylene moulding composition with a<br>
multimodal molar weight distribution which comprises an ultrahigh-<br>
molecular weight polyethylene fraction, a low molecular weight ethylene<br><br>
2. Polyethylene Compositions<br>
a) Ultra-High Molecular Weight Fractions<br>
Four ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene polymers have been<br>
prepared in the following manner:<br>
For the preparation of the compositions according to the invention, two<br>
UHMW copolymers of ethylene and 1-butene (UHMW1, UHMW2), and for<br>
the preparation of the comparative compositions (see below) two ethylene<br>
homopolymers (UHMW3 and UHMW4) have been produced.<br>
Ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene polymers were prepared in<br>
the following manner:<br>
Reactor:	stainless steel reactor, 2 1<br>
Reactor medium:	iso-Butane (900 ml)<br>
Inert gas:	Nitrogen<br>
Temperature:	85°C<br>
Comonomer:	1-Butene (where applicable)<br>
Hydrogen addition:	Batchwise<br>
Ethylene feed:	Batchwise and continuous<br>
Comonomer addition:	Batchwise and continuous<br>
Al/Ti (mol/mol):	25<br>
The polymerisations were carried out in a stainless steel reactor equipped<br>
with an anchor stirrer. The polymerisations were done in i-butane slurry at<br>
85°C at a total pressure of 22.2 bar.<br>
As a catalyst, Lynx 200™, a MgCl2 supported titanium containing catalyst<br>
available from Engelhard Corporation Pasadena, U.S.A.<br><br>
TEAL was used as cocatalyst. An Al/Ti (mol/mol) ratio of 25 was used.<br>
The comonomer was 1-butene. Hydrogen was added as one batch at the<br>
outset of reaction. Ethylene was added continuously during the<br>
polymerisation to maintain a constant reactor pressure. 1-Butene was added<br>
(where applicable) both as a batch at the outset of reaction, and cascaded<br>
with ethylene during polymerisation.<br>
After polymerisation was completed, the reactor was vented and the content<br>
was exposed to air.<br>
The properties of these polymers are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
b) Compositions<br>
In Examples 1 to 4, 5 wt% of UHMW polymers, A1 to A4, respectively,<br>
were mechanically blended with the resin in Example 5. Blends were<br>
compounded on a small scale twin-screw Prism 24 mm extruder two times<br>
with a melt temperature of 190 to 230°C (logged process data). 1000 ppm<br>
of Irganox B561 was added to the blends.<br>
In Example 5, the pure polyethylene base resin comprising components (B)<br>
and (C) without addition of any UHMW component is given. This is BS<br>
2581 commercially available from Borealis.<br>
The properties of the obtained compositions are given in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
