				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a press molding die capable of preventing a workpiece from moving during press molding, and a manufacturing method of same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] In order to press a platy workpiece into shapes, initially, the workpiece is placed on a molding surface of a molding die having a predetermined-shaped concave portion. On the periphery of the concave portion, the workpiece is pressed to the molding die by a pad and is fixed. Then, the workpiece is plastically deformed by being pressed by a punch having a shape corresponding to the concave portion. In such press molding, a problem occurs that the workpiece moves into the concave portion, that is, so-called displacement of the workpiece is caused. The displacement of the workpiece affects the accuracy of a press molded product, the quality of a surface of the press molded product, and the like. In addition, due to such a problem useful lives of the molding die and the punch are shortened, and the cost of maintenance of the molding die and the punch increases.<br>
[0003] An example of methods for preventing the workpiece from moving is to increase the pressing force of the pad during press molding. However, since the pressing force of the pad acts in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the workpiece moves, it is necessary to apply a tremendous amount of pressing force in order to prevent the workpiece from moving. Also, it is impossible to prevent the workpiece from moving substantially completely. It is also possible to prevent the workpiece from moving by precisely controlling the distance between the molding die and the pad. However, such control requires a complicated configuration of the die and skills in adjustment, thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing the die.<br>
[0004] As related art, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-268808 discloses a known metalworking tool for suppressing occurrence of a weld marks which are likely to occur during cold work and press work of metal, and for preventing a slip which occurs due to lubricating oil used for preventing occurrence of the weld marks. The metalworking tool is a plastic forming tool and a plurality of small dents is formed on the<br><br>
smooth surface of the metal working tool. Each of the dents has a diameter of 5 to 50um, and a depth of 0.5 to 5 Âµm. The total area of the dents accounts for 5 to 50% of the surface area of the tool before the dents are formed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014] In the following description, the present invention will be described in more detail in terms of exemplary embodiments.<br>
[0015] FIG. 1 is a view schematically showing a press molding die according to the invention. The press molding die includes a molding die 1, a pad 2, and a punch 3, and is used for pressing a platy workpiece 4 into shapes. In the press molding die, a concave portion 5 having a shape corresponding to the punch 3 is formed on a molding surface of the molding die 1. The workpiece 4 placed on the molding surface is pressed to the molding die 1 by the pad 2 and is fixed, on the periphery of the concave portion 5. In this case, the press molding die according to the invention is characterized in that a micro-rough layer 6 is formed by performing a particulate coating process on at least one of a portion of the pad 2, for pressing the workpiece 4, and a portion of the molding surface, corresponding to the portion of the pad 2, for pressing the workpiece 4.<br>
[0016] In the press molding die, when the workpiece 4 is sandwiched between the molding die 1 and the pad 2 and is pressed by the pad 2, the roughness of the micro-rough layer 6 deforms the workpiece 4 using the pressing force of the pad 2. The deformation acts as resistance in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the workpiece 4 moves. In the press molding die according to the invention, the workpiece 4 contacts the molding die 1 only at the convex portions of the micro-rough layer 6. Therefore, in the case where the micro-rough layer 6 is formed, the pressing force applied to the workpiece 4 per unit area is larger than that in the case where the micro-rough layer 6 is not formed, even the pressing force applied by the pad 2 is the same. As a result, it is possible to effectively prevent the workpiece 4 from moving.<br>
[0017] It is preferable to set the height of the roughness of the micro-rough layer 6 to 0.01 to 0.06 mm. If the height of the roughness of the micro-rough layer 6 is smaller than 0.01 mm, the effect of preventing the workpiece 4 from moving using the micro-rough layer 6 cannot be obtained effectively. On the other hand, if the height of the roughness of the micro-rough layer 6 exceeds 0.06 mm, there occurs transfer marks which are sufficiently large to be visually observed even coating is applied to the molding surface<br>
after the workpiece is molded, which degrades the appearance quality of the molded product.<br>
[0018] The micro-rough layer 6 is formed by performing the particulate coating process. In the particulate coating process, the size of a particle of the metal having high hardness is increased on the plating surface. The plating process needs to be performed at an appropriate temperature of the plating solution, an appropriate current density and the like. Also, the plating process is preferably performed using a silicofluoric chrome plating solution.<br>
[0019] The silicofluoric chrome plating solution preferably contains 200 to 300 g of chromic anhydride, 1 to 8 g of sodium silicofluoride, and 0.5 to 1.5 g of sulfuric acid per liter. The particulate coating process is preferably performed using the plating solution, in the condition in which the temperature of the plating solution is 40 to 50 Â°C, the current density is 100 to 150 A/dm2, and the plating time is 3 to 10 minutes. The thus obtained micro-rough layer 6 has physical properties such as a thickness of 10 to 40 urn, a hardness of 1000 to 1100 HV, a particle diameter of 10 to 30Âµm, and surface roughness of 10 to 30 ÂµmRy. Also, the adhesion of the micro-rough layer 6 to the press molding die is high. Accordingly, it is possible to sufficiently satisfy the requirements on the micro-rough layer 6 which is formed on the press molding die.<br>
[0020] The particulate coating process for forming the micro-rough layer 6 can be performed in the same process as a common plating process. Initially, a surface of the press molding die, on which the particulate coating process is performed, is degreased, and another surface, on which the particulate coating process is not performed, is masked. Then, the press molding die is set on a jig, and an anode and a cathode are set. Then, the press molding die is immersed, for example, in the silicofluoric chrome plating solution having the above-mentioned composition. Electric power is supplied for a predetermined period, the press molding die is taken out from the silicofluoric chrome plating solution, is washed, the jig is removed, and the press molding die is dried. Thus, the micro-rough layer 6 is formed by the particulate coating process.<br>
[0021] The micro-rough layer 6 may be formed of a plurality of plated layers, as shown in FIG. 2. In the example shown in FIG. 2, the micro-rough layer 6 is formed of a lower side plated layer 71 having a smooth surface, and an upper side plated layer 72 which is formed by the particulate coating process and which has roughness. In the case where the micro-rough layer 6 is formed of two plated layers, durability of the press<br>
molding die and the micro-rough layer 6 can be enhanced, compared with the case where the micro-rough layer 6 is formed only by the particulate coating process.<br>
[0022] On the molding surface of the press molding die, grooves which are formed by common machining may be formed, in addition to the micro-rough layer 6. A plurality of grooves which are parallel to each other, and another plurality of grooves which are parallel to each other are formed such that the plurality of grooves and the other plurality of grooves extend in different directions. The grooves formed in the direction parallel to the direction in which the workpiece 4 moves have low degree of resistance to the movement of the workpiece 4. Therefore, it is preferable to form the grooves in the direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which the workpiece 4 moves.<br>
[0023] Concrete examples of the grooves are shown in FIG. 3 which is the top view of the molding die 1, at the center of which is the concave portion 5. In the example shown in FIG. 3 A, a plurality of vertical grooves 81 and another plurality of horizontal grooves 82 which are perpendicular to each other are formed on the molding surface of the molding die 1. The distance between the grooves is, for example, 2 mm. In the example shown in FIG. 3B, grooves 83 each of which has a shape similar to that of the periphery of the concave portion 5. The grooves 83 are formed in a loop shape so as to surround the concave portion 5. The direction in which the workpiece 4 moves is the direction radiating from the concave portion 5. Therefore, the grooves 83 are formed in the direction perpendicular to all the directions in which the workpiece 4 moves, and the effect of preventing the workpiece 4 from moving is particularly high. The grooves can be formed by shot blasting, ceramic spraying, pattern plating, laser spraying, or the like.<br>
[0024] In the press molding using the press molding die according to the invention, initially, the workpiece 4 is placed on the molding die 1 such that the rear surface of the workpiece 4 faces the molding surface of the molding die 1. Then, the workpiece 4 is pressed to the press molding die by the pad 2, and is fixed. The workpiece 4 is then pressed by the punch 3 so as to be plastically deformed. In this case, the workpiece 4 contacts only the convex portions of the micro-rough layer 6 of the press molding die. Therefore, the pressing force applied to the workpiece 4 per unit area is considerably large, compared with the case where the micro-rough layer 6 is not formed. As the punch 3 is moved downward, the force for moving the workpiece 4 into the concave portion 5 is generated. At this time, the roughness of the micro-rough layer deforms the workpiece such that the deformation prevents the workpiece from moving. The micro-rough layer 6 generates transfer marks on the rear surface of the workpiece 4.    However, since the<br>
micro-rough layer 6 does not affect the front surface of the workpiece 4, the appearance quality of the workpiece 4 is not affected.<br>
[0025] A micro-rough layer was formed on a surface of a molding die by the particulate coating process using a plating solution and plating conditions shown in the following table. A microscope photograph of the formed micro-rough layer was taken. FIG. 4 shows a pattern diagram of the microscope photograph of the micro-rough layer formed in the first embodiment. FIG. 5 shows a pattern diagram of the microscope photograph of the micro-rough layer formed in the second embodiment. The diameter of the particle of the formed micro-rough layer was decided, and the thickness of the plating was measured by an electromagnetic thicknessmeter. Then, press molding was performed using both of the molding dies, and movement of the workpiece during press molding and the surface properties of the workpiece after press molding were evaluated. Table 1 shows the result of the evaluation.<br>
[0026]    [Table 1]<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
[0027] According to the invention, a micro-rough layer is formed on a molding surface of a press molding die, at a portion to which a workpiece is pressed by a pad and is fixed. With this arrangement, it is possible to prevent the workpiece from moving into a concave portion, that is, it is possible to prevent so-called displacement of the workpiece, without accurately controlling the conditions of press molding. Since the micro-rough layer is formed by the particulate coating process, it is possible to obtain a press molding die with a simple configuration, and to manufacture the press molding die at low cost.<br><br>
