				<td>TOPICAL SKIN CARE COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to a method of making a medicated skin treating composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melasma or chloasma is a common pigmentary condition that affects primarily women in their reproductive years. Dark, mottled (hyperpigmented) patches appear on the face and neck, especially on the cheeks and forehead. Melasma is usually triggered by hormonal activity that is the result of pregnancy or birth control pills. Thus, the condition is known as the "mask of pregnancy." The condition occurs when excess melanin is deposited in the cells of the epidermis and dermis. Melasma can persist for long periods of time and often recurs with subsequent pregnancies. The condition is less common among men, who account for about 10% of all cases.<br>
Standard therapy involves depigmenting, or bleaching, the affected areas of the skin, the use of sunscreens, and avoidance of sunlight. Hydroquinone is the most popular topical depigmenting agent. Concentrations of 5%-l0% hydroquinone are very effective, but can be irritating. The chemical stability of hydrqquinone formulations is important because hydroquinone is easily oxidized and loses potency. The most commonly used agent usually involves a 16-week to 20-week course of therapy, and some therapies can take longer. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is another widely used therapy for melasma.<br>
Nevertheless, there remains a need in the art for a therapeutic approach that would contain several medicines for the treatment of melasma in a single composition. Moreover, it would be useful to have a therapeutic carrier, such as a cream, mat would facilitate the penetration of the medicaments into the skin.<br>
least one oil-soluble antioxidant; and wherein the composition comprises a corticosteroid.<br>
Nevertheless, there remains a need in the art for a method of making a smoother cream base for the application of therapeutic agents for the treatment of melasma, which will facilitate the penetration of the medicaments into the skin.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a cream base for the topical application of skin -care-therapeutics and a process for making the cream base.<br>
The process for making the cream base entails (a) mixing the hydrophilic compounds with water to form an aqueous phase; (b) mixing the hydrophobic compounds to form a hydrophobic (non-aqueous or wax) phase; then (c) mixing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases with one another to form a biphasic mixture; and finally (d) adding an emulsifier to the biphasic mixture to form the emulsion. By mixing the emulsifier after the aqueous and non-aqueous phases have been mixed, the result is a smoother-textured cream that disappears on application to skin, as compared to creams made by processes where the emulsifier is added to the aqueous or non-aqueous phases earlier in the process. Because the emulsifier is added as the final step, less wax is needed in making the cream, resulting in a "thinner" hydrophilic cream that disappears faster when applied to the skin, as compared to creams made by processes where the emulsifier is added to the aqueous or non-aqueous phases earlier in. the process.<br>
The cream base made by the method of interest can be a carrier for any of a variety of pharmaceutically active agents for dermatologic use. For example, anti-acne, anti-cancer, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, hormone, anti-fungal and analgesic active agents can be incorporated into a cream base of interest.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a cream base of interest comprises a steroid.<br>
In another embodiment, a cream base of interest comprises a keratolytic agent.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,737 discloses a method of making a water-in-oil emulsion containing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an H2-antagonist. The steps include dissolving the pharmaceutically acceptable salt in an aqueous medium to form a water portion; combining the water portion with an oil portion, comprising an edible oil comprising an ester or mixed ester of glycerol and an emulsifying agent to form a water portion and oil portion matrix; then emulsifying the matrix to form the water-in-oil emulsion.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,672 discloses a process for preparing a water-in-oil emulsion with retinal as the active ingredient The emulsion contains an oil phase including at least one organic solvent for retinal (such as aliphatic fatty alcohols) and optional lipophilic additives; an aqueous phase containing water and optional hydrophilic additives; and an agent for emulsifying the aqueous phase in the oil phase. The oil phase and the aqueous phase are independently prepared, and the aqueous phase is incorporated into the oil phase, with subsequent addition of a phase-containing retinol and its solvent<br>
U.S. Pat No. 5,660,837 discloses a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The steps of the process include of adding the emulsion-stabilizing surface active drug and an optimal conventional surfactant to a two-phase, oil-water system at room temperature; allowing the emulsion-stabilizing surface active drug to equilibrate at an interface; adding an agent giving isotoniciry to the final formulation; and homogenizing by high pressure technique.<br>

An oil-in-water emulsion base contains retinoids; cetearyl alcohol and cetearyl glucoside or a mixture of a polyethylene glycol ethers of stearyl alcohol; cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof; a light, dry absorbable oil; and substantive, emollient oils or waxes.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,393 discloses a skin care composition comprising an oil-in-water emulsion with a therapeutically effective amount of a retmoid; wherein the oil phase comprising one or more oils, and an effective amount of at<br>
In yet another specific embodiment, a cream base of interest comprises a depigmenting agent<br>
In another embodiment, a cream base of interest comprises two or more of a steroid, keratolytic agent and depigmenting agent.<br>
An example of a steroid is fluocinolone, such as fluocinolone acetonide, of a keratolytic agent is tretinoin and of a depigmenting agent is hydroquinone.<br>
In a more specific embodiment, the invention also provides a cream, which -includes-the inactive ingredients butylatedhydroxytoluene, ceryl alcohol, citric acid, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, magnesium aluminum silicate, methyl gluceth-10, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, propylparaben, purified water, sodium metabisulfite, stearic acid and stearyl alcohol.<br>
In a particular embodiment, me cream is a carrier mat contains as an active ingredient, fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, tretinoin and combinations thereof. For example, the cream can be Tri-Luma® Cream, which is the first approved product to combine the standard depigmenting agent, hydroquinone, with tretinoin and a topical low-potency steroid that can be applied as a single preparation. The recommended course of therapy for Tri-Luma® Cream is 8 weeks, and significant results have been seen after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Another advantage of the process of the invention is mat by controlling the temperature at which the components, including hydroquinone, are added, the cream does not turn as brown, resulting in a more pleasing-colored product<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Creams are emulsions of hydrophilic and lipophilic (hydrophobia) components. Generally, an emulsifier or surface active agent is included to enhance the mixing of the reagents resulting in a stable emulsion.<br>
The various compounds that comprise an inert carrier are generally known in the art. By 'inert" is meant not having a pharmacologic activity. Typical examples of inert compounds comprising a cream base include cetyl alcohol,<br>
lanolin, glycerin, ethanol, EDTA, methyl paraben, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, benzoic acid, carboxymethylcellulose, dimethylsulfoxide, polyethyleneglycol, petroleum, citric acid and stearic acid.<br>
The instant invention relates to a method of making a cream base as a vehicle for one or more pharmacologically active agents for dermatologic applications. The method of interest comprises a particular order of adding and mixing of the ingredients of a cream. The hydrophilic ingredients, including water, are mixed. Heating may be used to facilitate dissolving and solubility to produce a solution. The lipophilic or hydrophobic ingredients are mixed separately. Heating may be used to facilitate mixing and homogenization.<br>
The hydrophilic solution and the lipophilic solution then are mixed and blended. One or more pharmaceutically active agents then are added to the blended mixture. Then, one or more emulsifiers are added and the entire mixture blended to produce a dermatologic cream of interest<br>
The temperatures for heating the hydrophobic and hydrophilic solutions is that sufficient to facilitate the obtention of a homogeneous solution. Generally, a lower elevated temperature with longer mixing time is preferred. The temperature also may be limited by the properties of any one of the individual ingredients therein. Generally, the temperature does not exceed about 100°C. Preferably, the temperature does not exceed about 90°C or about 80°C or about 70°C or about 60°C. Generally, the temperature of heating need not be exact, at least within the accuracy of standard temperature measurement means.<br>
The hydrophobic and hydrophilic solutions need not be heated to the same temperature. Having the same temperature facilitates the mixing of the two solutions. If the solutions are at different temperatures, the wanner solution is cooled to the temperature of the cooler solution prior to mixing.<br>
The blended mixture optionally may be cooled prior to mixing in the one or more pharmacologically active agent or agents. The physical properties of the active agents may dictate a need for cooling.<br>
Following that step and blending, one or more emulsifiers are added. The mixture is blended thoroughly to produce a cream of interest. If elevated, the temperature can be reduced during the blending.<br>
As to the lipophilic ingredients, as known in the art, oils may be derived from animals, plants, nuts, petroleum etc. Those derived from animals, plant seeds and nuts are similar to fats and consequently, may contain a significant number of polar acid and/or ester groups. Alternatively, oils derived from petroleum are usually aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons mat are essentially free of polar substitution.<br>
Oil-based products which can be used include hydrocarbons or mineral fats obtained by the distillation of petroleum (petroleum jelly); vegetable oils and liquid triglycerides; animal fats or solid, natural triglycerides; and waxes or solid ethers of fatty acids, such as stearic acid and palmitic acid, and organic alcohols. Lanolin or wool fats made of fatty acids and cholesterol esters; and cetyl and stearyl alcohols, which are solid alcohols obtained by hydrogenation of their respective acids are also useable. Amphoteric compounds such as soaps or salts of fatty acids that may be acidic or basic depending on whether the lipophilic group is anionic or cationic, sulfated alcohols which are semi-synthetic substances and synthetic surface active agents are known in the art and also can be used. Glycerin is obtained from fats and, due to the hydrophobicity thereof, has the property of extracting water from the surface of mucosa or denuded skin. Glycerin does not damage intact skin because of having hydrophilic properties, and is a useful humectant<br>
Other materials that may be used in a topical preparation of interest include liquid alcohols, liquid glycols, liquid polyalkylene glycols, liquid esters, liquid amides, liquid protein hydrosylates, liquid alkylated protein hydrosylates, liquid lanolin and lanolin derivatives and other like materials. Particular examples include monohydric and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., ethanol, isopropanol, glycerol, sorbitol, 2-methoxyethanol, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, hexylene glycol, mannitol, cetyl alcohol and propylene glycol; ethers such as diethyl or dipropyl<br>
ether; polyethylene glycols and methoxypolyoxyethylenes; carbowaxes having molecular weights ranging from 200 to 20,000; polyoxyethylene glycerols; polyoxyefhylene; sorbitols; and stearoyl diacetin.<br>
The topical carriers often include both an alcohol and water so as to accommodate lipophilic and hydrophilic components. Other ingredients include buffers, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium citrate or tetrasodium EDTA; excipients; fragrances such as menthol; opacifiers such as zinc oxide, magnesium aluminum silicate and titanium dioxide; preservatives such as dichlorobenzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, methylparaben and phenyl carbinol; antioxidants; gelling agents such as petrolatum and mineral wax; thickening agents such as carboxymethylcellulose; stabilizers; surfactants; emollients; coloring agents and the like.<br>
In addition, the topical carrier may include a penetration enhancer defined as a material that increases the permeability of the skin to one or more active agents so as to allow for cutaneous delivery of a pharmacologically active agent. Various compounds for enhancing the permeability of skin are known in the art. For example, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), decylmethylsulfoxide, polyethylene glycol monolaurate and the 1-substituted azacycloheptan-2-ones.<br>

The amounts of the inert ingredients and active agent(s) in the dermatologic preparation of interest generally are known in the art It is within the ambit of the artisan to derive particular amounts of the ingredients to obtain a cream of interest<br>
The particular amount of any one ingredient used is not substantially critical and the amounts used are at the accuracy of the measuring or dispensing means known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, approximately 344.8 kg of water, 15.0 kg magnesium aluminum silicate, and 0.2 kg butylated hydroxytoluene are first combined and mixed at 75-80°C to form the aqueous phase. The mixing can be by side scrape agitation at a fixed speed. The resulting aqueous phase is a suspension.<br>
Second, approximately 20.0 kg of cetyl alcohol, 15.0 kg of stearic acid, 20.0 kg of stearyl alcohol, 25.0 kg of methyl gluceth-10,0.9 kg of methylparaben, 0.1 kg of propylparaben, and 20.0 kg of glycerin are mixed together at medium speed at about 75-80°C to form the non-aqueous phase. The mixing can be at<br>
medium speed in a Lightnin® mixer. The resulting non-aqueous phase is a suspension. The second step can be performed before, after or concurrently with the first step.<br>
Then, the non-aqueous phase is added to the aqueous phase and the combined biphasic mixture is cooled to a temperature in the range of 68°C to 72°C, or about 70°C, after which about 17.5 kg of Arlacel® 165,0.25 kg tretmoin and 0.050 kg fluocmolone acetonide are added and stirred with cooling. When the mixture reaches 60°C, 0.25 kg citric acid is added with mixing and cooling. -When the temperature reaches 55°C, 20.0 kg hydroquinone is added with mixing and cooling. When the temperature reaches about 50°C, the mixture is homogenized with a homogenizer, with continued cooling. When the mixture reaches 45°C, 1.0 kg of sodium metabisulfite is added with stirring and cooling. Typically, the sodium metabisulfite is added about 30 minutes after the addition of the hydroquinone. The mixing can be at fixed speed in a side scrape agitator. The<br>
resulting composition of matter is an emulsion, i.e., a cream.<br>
The presence of sodium metabisulfite in the cream prevents the oxidation of hydroquinone. The addition of sodium metabisulfite as the cream is cooling advantageously results in a well-mixed composition of matter, with the sodium metabisulfite evenly mixed throughout the cream and preventing the oxidation of the hydroquinone throughout the cream. Another advantage of the process of the invention is that by controlling the temperature at which the components, including hydroquinone, are added, the cream does not turn as brown, resulting in a more pleasing-colored product.<br>
The addition of the emulsifier following the mixing of the non-aqueous and aqueous phases is advantageous for the making of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. When a standard technique of adding the emulsifier to the non-aqueous phase and then mixing with the aqueous phase was used, no emulsion formed. However, when the emulsifier was added to the mixture of the non-aqueous and aqueous phases with cooling, according to the method of the invention, a useful emulsion did form. This emulsion formed even though the<br>
relative proportion of the non-aqueous and aqueous phases according to the successful method of the invention was the same as when an emulsion did not form using the standard technique of adding a non-aqueous phase containing an emulsifier to an aqueous phase.<br>
The resulting TRI-LUMA® Cream contains fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone and tretinoin in a hydrophilic cream base for topical application. Each gram of TRI-LUMA® Cream contains as active ingredients, fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (0.1 mg), hydroquinone 4% (40 mg), and tretinoin 0.05% (0.5 mgX and as inactive ingredients, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, citric acid, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, magnesium aluminum silicate, methyl glucem-10, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, propylparaben, purified water, sodium metabisulfite, stearic acid, and stearyl alcohol, see TABLE 1.TABLE 1Ingredient<br>

The following EXAMPLES are presented to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. These EXAMPLES should in no way be consfrued as limiting the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
HUMAN PHARMACOKINETICS<br>
Percutaneous absorption of unchanged tretinoin, hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide into the systemic circulation of two groups of healthy<br>
volunteers (Total n=59) was found to be minimal following 8 weeks of daily application of 1 g (Group I, n=45) or 6 g (Group n, n=14) of TRI-LUMA® Cream.<br>
For tretinoin quantifiable plasma concentrations were obtained in 57.78% (26 out of 45) of Group I and 57.14% (8 out of 14) of Group n subjects. The exposure to tretinoin as reflected by the Cnm values ranged from 2.01 to 5.34 ng/mL (Group I) and 2.0 to 4.99 ng/mL (Group n). Thus, dairy application of TRI-LUMA* Cream resulted in a minimal increase of normal endogenous levels of tretinoin. The circulating tretinoin levels represent only a portion of total _ tretinoin-associated retinoids, which would include metabolites of tretinoin and that sequestered into peripheral tissues.<br>
For hydroquinone quantifiable plasma concentrations were obtained in 18% (8 out of 44) Group I subjects. The exposure to hydroquinone as reflected by the Cmax values ranged from 25.55 to 86.52 ng/mL. All Group n subjects (6g dose) had undetectably low post-dose plasma concentrations.<br>
For fluocinolone acetonide, Groups I and n subjects had undetectably low post-dose plasma concentrations.<br>
The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients: (a) ACTH or cosyntropin stimulation tests; (b) the A.M. plasma cortisol test; and (c) the urinary free cortisol test<br>
EXAMPLE n<br>
HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES<br>
Two efficacy and safety studies were conducted in 641 melasma patients between the ages of 21 to 75 years, having skin phototypes I-IV and moderate to severe melasma of the face. TRI-LUMA* Cream was compared with three possible combinations of two of the three active ingredients [(1) hydroquinone 4% (HQ) + tretinoin 0.05% (RA); (2) fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (FA) + tretinoin 0.05% (RA); (3) fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (FA) + hydroquinone 4% (HQ)], contained in the same vehicle as TRI-LUMA* Cream.<br>
The patients were instructed to apply their study medication each night, after washing their face with a mild soapless cleanser, for 8 weeks. The patients were also instructed to apply a thin layer of study medication to the hyperpigmented lesion, making sure to cover the entire lesion including the outside borders extending to the normal pigmented skin. The patients were provided a mild moisturizer for use as needed and a sunscreen with SPF 30 for daily use. Moreover, the patients were instructed to avoid sunlight exposure to the face, wear protective clothing Protective clothing and avoidance of sunlight exposure to the face was recommended.<br>
The patients were evaluated for melasma severity at baseline and at weeks 1,2,4, and 8 of treatment. Primary efficacy was based on the proportion of patients who had an investigators' assessment of treatment success, defined as the clearing of melasma at the end of the eight-week treatment period. The majority of patients enrolled in the two studies were white (approximately 66%) and female (approximately 98%). TRI-LUMA® Cream was demonstrated to be significantly more effective than any of the other combinations of the active ingredients.<br>
Patients experienced improvement of their melasma with the use of TRI-LUMA® Cream as early as 4 weeks. However, among 7 patients who had clearing at the end of 4 weeks of treatment with TRI-LUMA® Cream, 4 of them did not maintain the remission after an additional 4 weeks of treatment.<br>
After 8 weeks of treatment with the study drug, patients entered into an open-label extension period in which TRI-LUMA® Cream was given on an as-needed basis for the treatment of melasma. In studies, after 8 weeks of treatment with TRI-LUMA® Cream, most patients had at least some improvement. Some had their dark spots clear up completely (38% in one study and 13% in another). In most patients treated with TRI-LUMA* Cream, their melasma came back after treatment. The remission periods appeared to shorten between progressive courses of treatment. Additionally, few patients maintained complete clearing of melasma (approximately 1 to 2%).<br>

EXAMPLE m<br>
ADVERSE REACTIONS IN HUMANS<br>
In a patch test study to determine sensitization potential in 221 healthy volunteers, three volunteers developed sensitivity reactions to TRI-LUMA® Cream or its components.<br>
In the controlled clinical trials, adverse events were monitored in the 161 patients who used TRI-LUMA* Cream once daily during an 8-week treatment period. There were 102 (63%) patients who experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event during these studies. The most frequently reported events were erythema, desquamation, burning, dryness, and pruritus at the site of application. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity. Adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients and judged by the investigators to be reasonably related to treatment with TRI-LUMA* Cream fromthe controlled clinical studies are summarized (in decreasing order of frequency) as follows:<br><br>

Cream In At Least 1% or More of Patients (N=161)<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
In an open-label long-term safety study, patients who have had cumulative treatment of melasma with TRI-LUMA® Cream for 6 months showed a similar pattern of adverse events as in the 8-week studies. The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, bypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.<br>
