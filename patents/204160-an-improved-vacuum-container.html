30-9-2005<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
301/MUM/2000<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates on an improved vacuum/thermal container. More particularly this invention relates to a vacuum container for storing food products or the like, under the airless or vacuum condition to keep the food healthy and safe and preserving its taste for 5    a longer period.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The hygroscopic food products like coffee, tea etc, stored in a normal container are prone to absorb moisture from the air when exposed to atmosphere, resulting into growth to 10    fungus on the food product thereby spoiling the product making it totally unsuitable for consumption.<br>
The food product like crisp fried snacks such as wafers, banana-chips, namkins, papads, chakali etc. And dry baked or roasted food products such as biscuits, non-khatais,<br>
15 roasted papads, cheeselings etc. dry fruits like cashewnuts, almonds, pistas, walnuts etc. powdered food products like flours, spices like chillies, turmeric and other masalas, processed food products like baby foods, milk powders, malted health drinks, sweets, doughs and some cooked foods when stored in normal containers get exposed to atmospheric air and lose their crispness and other inharent qualities in a short period<br>
20    thereby making them tasteless as well as deteriorating their quality.<br>
To overcome these problems and drawbacks of a normal container for storing food products, some vacuum containers have been developed.<br>
25 The existing vacuum container known in the prior art are generally made of metals and fitted with mortised vacuum pumps. These vacuum containers being cumbersome and costly could not be popularized for domestic use. Some vacuum containers, known as vacuumizers, are made in plastics but the construction of these containers also is very complecated and cumbersome.<br>
30<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of these invention is to provide an improved vacuum/thermal container<br>
which is quite simple in construction, easy to manufacture and very easy to use/operate<br>
2<br><br>
manually and at the same time provide desired vacuum within no time, for safely storing the food, and maintain the same vacuum without permitting any leakage for sufficiently long time.<br>
5 Another object of this invention is to provide an improved vacuum/thermal container which permits an easy and instant opening of the lid, for adding or taking out any product stored therein.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an improved vacuum/thermal container 10    wherein a filtering means is provided   to prevent even a very fine particle of the food product coming out with the air during vaccumization.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide improved vacuum /thermal container which is cheaper in initial cost, has no cost for use, no maintainance and is easy to clean and 15    store.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Accordingly this invention provides an improved vacuum/thermal container, comprising of a hollow body with top open end closed by a lid in a leak proof manner, the said lid<br>
20 compartment form in between upper top surface and a lower surface, the said lower surface having a opening communicating with the body in the closed position, a vacuum, suction pump consisting of a piston with handle for manual operation, provide in the said compartment of the lid, a vacuum release value provided in the said compartment and a button connecting the said valve provided in the said upper top surface of the lid.' j<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Although following examples shows the operation of    specific embodiments,  many modifications and variations will readily occur to those skilled in the art, accordingly it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. 5<br>
Referring to fig. 1 to 3, the improved vacuum container (1) according to an embodiment of this invention comprises a hollow body (2), open at top end (3) and adopted to be closed by a lid (4) in leak proof manner. The body (2) in preferably, a jar or bowl shaped made of food grade plastic material selected by taking into consideration properties like<br>
10 durability, working feasibility and aesthetics. The open top end (3) of the body (2) is provided with a shoulder (5) which is preferably tapering outwardly to provide strength in a substantially flat seat (6) with a raised collar (7). The inner surface of the open open top end (3) is kept straight and smooth. The lid (4) at its perephery is provided with an inner collar (8) depending downwardly from the lower top surface (9) and fitting<br>
15 smoothly but tightly at the top open end (3) of body (2). A peripheral groove (10) for accommodating therein an "0" ring seal (11) is provided outside of the said inner collar (8). The groove (10) is in alignment and exactly matching with the collar (7) of the body. A preferably flat seat (12) is provided at the outer periphery of the groove, matching with the said seat (6) of the body. The arrangement provides  strong airtight sealing means<br>
20 for closing the lid on the body in a leak proof manner and sealing the same to maintain the vacuum. A vacuum/suction pump (13) consisting of a piston (14) having a handle (15) for operating manually is provided in the lid (4) in the space between upper top surface (16) and lower surface (9) of the lid. The piston (14) is provided with longitudinal slot (17) for evacuating out the air from the container. The lower surface (9) is provided<br>
25 with the opening (18) which is covered by a filter (19) kept is placed with the help of a cap (20). A valve (21) with push button (22) is provided in top surface (16) of the lid (4) which when pressed release the vacuum hereby allowing the lid (4) to be removed from the body (1) preferably silicon rubber ring are used at the meeting junction of the body and lid. Rubber washer to withstand the vacuum pressure as well the atmospheric<br>
30 pressure are used at the junction of piston and lid around the pussed of the vacuum release valve. The manual pumping according to this invention makes the vacuum container compact, easy to manufacture and use at the same time vacuum is created quickly. The valve with push button gives easy and instant   release of vacuum and<br>
4<br><br>
opening of lid.<br>
After putting the food stuff into the container, clean the edges of the container and lid and place lid properly on the container, then pump air out the container with the help of manual push pump attached on the center of the lid. After 8-10 pumps the container will 5    be vaccumised.<br>
â€¢    To check weather the vacuum is created or not do the following test   hold the<br>
container with one hand and pull the lid. If the lid does not come out than the<br>
vacuum is created.<br>
10	â€¢    To open the lid of the container, press the red push button which is provided on<br>
the top of the lid once the button is pressed vacuum is released and the lid of the container is opened to remove the preserved products.<br><br>
5<br><br>
