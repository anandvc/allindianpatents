The present invention relates to an improved and convenient process for the preparation<br>
of Donepezil, which is chemically known as 2,3-dihydro-5, 6-dimethoxy-2 [[l-(phenyl<br>
methyl)-4-piperidinyl] methyl]-lH-inden-1-one and represented by Formula (I). More<br>
specifically the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a<br>
key   intermediate	5,6-dimethoxy-2-piperidin-4-ylmethyl-indan-l-one,   which    is<br>
represented as Formula (VI) by an economically, and industrially preferable method.<br><br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Donepezil hydrochloride is an acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) inhibitor used for treatment<br>
of patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). Alzheimer senile dementia is accompanied by lowering in cholinergic hypofunction caused due to deficiency of acetyl choline enzyme in brain. Donepezil is the first promising agent for the treatment of this type of disease. This new drug was approved first in US in 1997 and later in 64 countries. It acts as an anti acetyl cholin esterase and increases the acetyl choline present<br><br>
in the brain. It is effective for the treatment of various conditions involving memory loss<br>
such as Alzheimer's disease and other neuro degenerative disorders.<br>
US  Patent  4,895,481   claims  Donepezil,  its  related compounds  along  with  their<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable salts including composition and method of treatment using<br>
them. The process for the preparation of Donepezil is disclosed by the aforesaid product<br>
patent comprises the conversion of l-benzyl-4-piperidinone to  l-benzyl-4-piperidine<br>
carboxaldehyde in the presence of n- butyl lithium, which on further reaction with 5,6-<br>
dimethoxy-1-indanone in the presence of strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide<br>
under inert atmosphere followed by reduction of the obtained compound to give the title<br>
compound of Formula (1) with an overall yield of 27.4%.<br>
US Patent 5,606,064 also discloses the process for the preparation of Donepezil, which<br>
comprises reacting 5,6-dimethoxy indanone and pyridine-4-carboxaldehyde to yield 5,6<br>
dimethoxy-2-pyridin-4-yl methylene-indan-1-one, which upon condensation with benzyl<br>
bromide followed by reduction of the obtained compound with platinum oxide to afford<br>
the title compound of Formula (I) with an overall yield of 58.5%.<br>
WO 97/22584 also discloses the process for the preparation of Donepezil of Formula (I)<br>
in the preparations 1 to 3 and example 1 to 6, with an alleged overall yield of 19.3%<br>
starting from Pyridine-4- carboxaldehyde.<br>
The prior art procedures for the preparation of Donepezil are having some disadvantages<br>
such as usage of hazardous raw materials like lithium diisopropyl amine and n-butyl<br>
lithium.   These procedures also involve the usage of very costly raw material, platinum<br>
oxide for reduction. The processes involve the chromatographic separations for isolation<br>
of intermediates and yielded in very low. The processes for the preparation of Donepezil<br><br>
are also involving more number of steps, which in turn resulted the less cost effective<br>
processes.   These are less viable for commercial production as the usage of n-butyl<br>
lithium is at very low temperature (i.e., -80oC).<br>
Additionally, the process for the preparation of Donepezil was also disclosed in<br>
EP 534859 in example 9A1 and US 6252081B1 in example 1, 2, and 3 with satisfactory<br>
yield of 82.5%, but this process also comprises of the steps utilizing hazardous material<br>
such as, sodium hydride in two of steps and highly expensive material, such as platinum<br>
oxide in the final step.<br>
These foregoing problems, directed us towards the present invention, which is the<br>
convenient and economic process for the preparation of the compound of the Formula (I).<br>
The present invention more specifically related to provide a novel process for the<br>
preparation of a key intermediate, depicted as Formula (VI) in high yield using the<br>
palladium catalyzed hydrogenation.<br>
The process of the present invention avoids the usage of hazardous and costly raw<br>
materials such as n-butyl lithium and platinum oxide. The present process involves less<br>
number of steps and resulted the key intermediate of Formula (VI) in 100% yield. Thus,<br>
the present process is more cost effective, non-hazardous and easily scalable over the<br>
prior art processes.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved and convenient process for the preparation of 2,3-dihydro-5, 6-dimethoxy-2 [[1-(phenyl methyl)-4-piperidinyl] methyl]-lH-inden-1-one (Donepezil) and represented by Formula (I).<br>
More particularly the improved process of the present invention comprises the preparation of key intermediate of Formula (VI) by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation of compound of Formula (IV), followed by its conversion to Donepezil with an overall yield of 83.03%.<br>
The process of the present invention avoids the usage of hazardous and expensive raw materials such as n-Butyl lithium, phosphorous pentaoxide and lithium diisopropylamine. The present process  is more cost effective, non-hazardous  and easily scalable to commercial quantities over prior art references. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

the solid was filtered off under suction. Further the wet solid was suspended in aqueous<br>
10% sodium carbonate solution (1200 ml) and stirred for 30-60 minutes.   The resulting<br>
pale yellow precipitate solid was filtered off under suction, washed with water (1000 ml)<br>

Sodium carbonate (4.40 grams), Benzyl Bromide (11.8 grams) was added slowly drop wise at a temperature of 50Â°C.
