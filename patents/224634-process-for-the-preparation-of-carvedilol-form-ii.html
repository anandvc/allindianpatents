FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a new process involving minimal workup steps without using strong mineral acids and avoiding any degradation of the final product for the preparation of Carvedilol Form-II using novel Carvedilol salts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Carvedilol is a non-selective p-adrenergic blocking agent with vasodilating activity.<br>
Carvedilol, (±) l-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy)-3[[2-(2"methoxy phenoxy) ethyl] amino]-2-propanol [CAS Registry No 72956-09-3] has the structure of Formula-1<br><br>
Carvedilol has a chiral center and can exist either as individual stereo isomer or in racemic form. Racemic Carvedilol is the active ingredient of COREG®, which is indicated for the treatment of congestive heart failure and hypertension. Both the racemate and stereoisomers may be obtained accordingly to procedures well known in the art (EP 0 127 099).<br>
SYNTHESIS OF CARVEDILOL:<br>
Various routes of synthesis have been used or suggested for the preparation of Carvedilol. Thus EP 0 004 920 reported the preparation of Carvedilol by reaction of 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole (II) with 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl amine (III).<br><br><br>
The above process produces a low yield of Carvedilol at least in part because in addition to Carvedilol, the process leads to the production of a bis impurity (IV) of the following structure<br><br>
EP 0 918 055 discloses that the Formation of the bis compound (IV) can be avoided by protecting the 'N' atom in 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethylamine before reaction with 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole using a benzyl group as a protection group. The product benzyl-Carvedilol (V) Formed has to be debenzylated before the desired product Carvedilol is formed, where debenzylation is done by hydrogenative debenzylation. This procedure clearly introduces two additional steps in the synthesis, namely a benzylation and a debenzylation step.<br><br>
PCT Publication WO 01 / 87837 describes the synthesis of Carvedilol by the reaction of 4"hydroxy carbazole with 5-chloromethyl-3- (2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl)-oxazolidin-2-one (VI). The 5-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy methyl)-3-[2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl] oxazolidin-2"one (VII) Formed has to be hydrolyzed before the desired product Carvedilol is formed.<br><br><br>
Moreover the preparation of 5-chloromethyl-3- [2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl]-oxazolidin-2-one (VI) requires sequence of reactions viz-reaction of 1,3-dichloro propan -2-ol with phenyl chloroformate followed by condensation of the resulting intermediate 2-methoxy phenoxy ethylamine thereby introducing a number additional steps in the synthesis. The publication also discloses hydrolysis of VII to Carvedilol in acidic medium and formation of salts.<br>
PCT Publication WO 02/00216 describes the preparation of Carvedilol by reaction of 4-(253-epoxy propoxy) carbazole (II) with 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl amine (III) in which the formation of bis compound (IV) can be avoided by taking large molar excess of III, the reaction being carried out in absence of solvent or in presence of solvents toluene, xylene and heptane. In the same publication the process for isolation of Carvedilol as crystalline hydrochloride is described to obtain the crystalline hydrochloride, hydrochloride hydrate and methyl ethyl ketone-solvate. The crude Carvedilol was isolated as hydrochloride salt after an elaborate work-up using strong acid like hydrochloric acid at pH 3.0 -5.0. The use of large molar excess of 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl amine (III) (2.8 mol - 6.0 mol for 1.0 mol of 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole (II) makes this process uneconomical. Moreover the use of strong mineral acids for the salt Formation can lead to decomposition of the product. It has been a long standing need in industry to provide a process for the preparation of Carvedilol involving minimal workup steps without using strong mineral acids and avoiding any degradation of the final product.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a cost-effective, industrially feasible process for the<br>
manufacture of crystalline Carvediloi Form-II using novel Carvedilol salts such as oxalate, salicylate, comprising a step of reacting 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole (II) with 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl amine (III) in molar ratio of about 1: 2 to about 1: 2.5, followed by acidification with mineral acid in presence of an organic solvent to yield acid addition salts, treatment of the said salts with base(s) in presence of organic solvent(s), water and isolation from the organic solvent(s) followed by crystallization from ethyl acetate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The essential features of the present invention is the process for the manufacture of Carvedilol Form-II using novel salts of Carvedilol which comprises of the steps:<br>
1.	Reaction of 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole with 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethyl amine in the molar ratio of 1: 2.0 - 1: 2.5 in presence of solvent(s)<br>
2.	Adjustment of pH after the completion of reaction with organic acid(s) in presence of water, organic solvent(s) and isolation of the Carvedilol salts<br>
3.	Treatment pf the salts with base(s) in a biphasic system of water and an water immiscible organic solvent(s)<br>
4.	Separation of the water immiscible organic solvent(s), isolation and crystallization of the Carvedilol from ethyl acetate<br>
Crude Carvedilol and recrystallized Carvedilol obtained by the process of the present invention are in the polymorphic Form-II and are anhydrous, as is evident from the IR spectrum and X-Ray diffraction pattern.<br><br>
The required 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole is prepared by the reaction of 4-hydroxy carbazole with epichlorohydrin in presence of potassium iodide and potassium carbonate in acetone at reflux temperature followed by removal of inorganics, distillation of the solvent and crystallization of the residue with methanol.<br>
The reaction of 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole with 2-(2methoxy phenoxy) ethylamine is carried out in presence of solvent at reflux temperature. The preferred molar ratio of 4-(2,3-epoxy propoxy) carbazole and 2-(2-methoxy phenoxy) ethylamine is 1:2- 1: 2.5.<br>
The solvents preferred are chlorobenzene, monoglyme (ethylene glycol diethyl ether), the reaction temperature is in the range of about 125^C to about 140^C, preferably about 130^C to about 133^C with chlorobenzene as solvent and in the range of about 80°C to about  90°C, preferably 87^C - 90"C with monoglyme as solvent.<br>
The work-up of reaction mass for isolation of salts varies based on the solvent medium. When the reaction medium is monoglyme, after the completion of reaction, the solvent is distilled off followed by addition of water and organic solvent(s), adjusting the pH of the reaction mass to about 2.0 to about 3.0 with organic acid(s) at temperature of about 40*^C and cooling the reaction mass to about 20*^C to about 25^C. The organic solvent is selected from isopropyl acetate or monochlorobenzene. When the reaction medium is chlorobenzene after completion of reaction, water is added and the pH is adjusted with organic acid(s) at above 40 C temperatures. The preferred organic acid is oxalic acid, salicylic acid or mixtures thereof and preferred temperature is about 45^C to about 50*^C and the pH is about 2.5 to about 2.8. The precipitated Carvedilol salts (Carvedilol oxalate, Carvedilol salicylate) is isolated by filtration, centrifugation etc.<br>
The Carvedilol sah is suspended in water, followed by addition of methylene chloride and basified to pH of about 9.0 to about 9.5 with suitable base(s) such as alkali, alkaline metal hydroxides, ammonia, organic bases such as triethyl amine, methyl amine at 20*^0 -25 C and stirred for about 1 to about 2 hrs. The preferred base is the ammonia solution. The reaction mass is allowed to settle and the layers are separated. The organic layer is<br><br>
dried over dehydrating agents such as anhydrous sodium sulphate, magnesium sulphate. The solvent is distilled off from the dried organic layer. The residue obtained is crystallized from ethyl acetate by dissolving in hot condition and then cooling to 0 C -lO^C. The Carvedilol so obtained may be further recrystallized from ethyl acetate to obtain a pharmaceutically acceptable quality. The invention is now illustrated with non-limiting examples<br>
