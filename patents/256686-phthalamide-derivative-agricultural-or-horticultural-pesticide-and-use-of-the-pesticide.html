In order to control various types of insect pests, the agricultural' or horticultural insecticide of the present invention is applied at an amount effective for controlling insect pests or nematodes, directly, or in the form, of being diluted with water or the like, or in the. 'form of being suspended in water or the like, to plants regarding which the infestation of such insect pests or nematodes is forecasted. When the present agricultural or horticultural insecticide is applied to orchards, cereals, vegetables, and the like, infested with insect pests or nematodes, for example, it is applied to leaves or stems thereof, or it can also be applied by treatments including: seed treatments such as immersion of seeds in the agent, or dust coating of seeds, or calper treatment; and soil treatments in i which the soil is treated with the agent, so as to allow plants to absorb the agent from roots thereof, such as mixing of the agent into all layers of the soil, row treatment, mixing the agent into bed soil,- cell nursery treatment, planting hole treatment, plant j foot treatment, top dressing, rice box treatment, or submerged application. In addition, addition of the agent to the solution in solution (slop) culture, fiomigation, or injection of the agent into tree trunks. <br><br>
may also be applied.. Moreover, the agricultural or horticultural insecticide of the present invention may be applied at an amount effective for controlling insect pests or nematodes, directly, or in the form of being diluted with water or the like, or in the form of being suspended in water or the like, to plants regarding which the infestation of such insect pests or nematodes is forecasted. For example, the present agricultural or horticultural insecticide is applied to stored grain insect pests, house insect pests, sanitary insect pests, forest insect pests, or the like. Otherwise, it may also be used by methods such as application to house construction materials, fumigation, or baiting. [0041]<br>
Examples of a seed treatment method may include: a method which comprises diluting or not diluting a liquid or solid formulation and then immersing seeds in the obtained solution , so as to allow an active ingredient to permeate into the seeds; a method which comprises mixing a solid or liquid formulation with seeds or dust-coating , so as to allow an active ingredient to attach onto the surface of the seeds; a method which comprises mixing an active ingredient with an adhesive carrier such as a resin or polymer and then coating seed's with the resultant product; and a method of applying the agent around seeds at the same time of planting. <br>
The term "seed" that is subjected to the above seed treatments means a plant body that is at the initial stage of culture for the reproduction of plants. Exair^les of such a seed may include a seed, a bulb, a tuber, a seed tuber, a stock bud, a propagule, a bulblet, and a plant body used for vegetative reproduction in cutting culture.<br>
The term "soil" or "culture carrier" for plants in the case of applying the use method of the present invention means a supporting medium for the ^	culture of plants, and particularly, a supporting<br>
medium in which plant roots are allowed to extend. The material of the soil or culture carrier is not specifically limited, as long as plants can grow thereon. Thus, such a soil or culture carrier may be what is called soil, a raising planting mat, water, or the like. Examples of a specific material may include sand, pumice, vermiculite, diatomous earth, agar, a , gelatinous substance, a polymer,"a rock wool, a glass ^	t wool, a wood chip, and a bark.<br>
[0042]<br>
Examples of a method of applying the agent to the stems or leaves of plants, stored grain insect pests, house insect pests, sanitary insect pests, j forest insect pests, or the like, may include: a method which comprises diluting a liquid formulation such as an emulsion or flowable or a solid formulation such as a wettable powder or water dispersible granule with water, as appropriate, and then applying the obtained solution to the target; a method of applying a dust; and fximigation.<br>
Examples, of a method of applying the agent to the soil may include: a method which.comprises diluting or not diluting a liquid formulation with water and then applying the obtained solution to the bottom . portion of a plant body or a.nursery bed for raising seedling; a method which comprises applying granules to the bottom portion of a plant body or a- nursery bed for ^^	raising seedling; a method which comprises applying the<br>
agent that is in the form of a dust, a wettable powder, a water dispersible granule, granules, or the like, to the soil before sowing or transplantation, so as to mix the agent into the soil as a whole; and a method which comprises applying the agent that is in the fom of a dust, a wettable powder, a water dispersible granule, granules, or the like, to planting holes or rows before sowing or planting of plant bodies. ^	^ [0043]<br>
With regard to a method of applying the agent to a nursery box used for paddy rice, a formulation may be different depending on the period of application of the agent, such as application during sowing, ) application during greening period, or application during transplantation. The agent may be applied in a formulation such as a dust, a water dispersible granule, or granules. The agent may also be applied by<br>
mixing it with molding. Mixing of the molding with a dust, a water dispersible granule, or granules, may be applied. For example, the agent may be mixed into seedbed soil, cover soil, or the molding as a whole. The agent may simply be applied by placing the molding and various types of formulations alternately in a layer form.<br>
As a method of applying the agent to the paddy field, the agent that is in a solid formulation, such as a jumbo formulation, a pack formulation, granules, or a water dispersible granule, or the formulation that is in a liquid form, such as a flowable or an emulsion, is generally applied in the paddy field filled with water. In addition, during the rice planting period, the agent that is in an appropriate formulation may be applied to or injected into the soil, directly or after being mixed with fertilizer. Moreover, the agent that is in the form of an emulsion or a flowable is applied to the source of<br>
) water supply to the paddy field, such as a waterspout or irrigation equipment, so as to apply the agent together with the supply of water in a labor-saving manner. [0044]<br>
5	For field crops, the agent can be applied to<br>
seeds or a culture carrier that is adjacent to plant bodies, during the sowing and raising seedling periods. In the case of plants that are directly sown to the<br>
field, direct application of the agent to seeds, and application of the agent to the bottom portions of plants during culture, are preferable. In addition, a method of applying the agent that is in a granule form and a method of applying the agent that has been diluted or undiluted with water in a liquid state are also possible. A method which comprises mixing■the agent that is in a granule form with a culture carrier before sowing and then sowing seeds on the. carrier is also preferable.<br>
As a method of applying the agent during the sowing and raising planting periods of culture plants to be transplanted, a method of directly applying the agent to seeds, a method of applying the agent that is in a liquid state to a nursery bed for raising planting, and a method of applying the agent that is in a granule form, are preferable. In addition, a method of applying the agent that is in a granule form into planting holes during fix planting, and a method of ) mixing the agent with a culture carrier around the place to which the plants to be transplanted, are also preferable.<br>

1. Test Example<br>
Insecticidal test on diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella)<br>
Adult diamondback moths were left for breeding on Chinese cabbage seedlings and allowed to lay eggs. Two days after the start of breeding, the Chinese cabbage seedlings with the deposited eggs were dipped in drug solution for about 30 seconds in which a drug containing a compound described in Tables 1 to 4 as an active ingredient was diluted to 50 ppm, and allowed to stand still in a temperature-controlled chamber at 25°C after air-dried. Six days after dipping in a drug solution, the number of hatched insects was counted. Insect mortality was calculated by the following formula and estimation was conducted according to the following criteria. 1 Lot, 10 insects, 3 series system. [Expression 1] '<br>
Number of hatched insects in non-treated lot - Insect	Number of hatched insects in treated lot<br>
