				<td>POWERTRAIN WITH TORQUE CONVERTER-MOUNTED GENERATOR FOR<br>
MULTIPLE VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL POWER AND METHOD FOR ASSEMBLING<br>
SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a powertrain with a torque converter-mounted<br>
generator and to a method of assembling powertrains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Motor vehicles, especially those of the military or commercial type, often<br>
include power take-off units or add-on devices connected with the vehicle engine and<br>
transmission for providing electrical power for external or "offboard" uses such as<br>
powering industrial equipment or tools. Such power take-off units and add-on devices<br>
require a significantly time-consuming installation process. Additionally, the overall<br>
axial length of the transmission is typically increased significantly with the incorporation<br>
of these devices into the vehicle powertrain. The application of a specific type of<br>
transmission by different customers varies widely, as does onboard and offboard power<br>
needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A torque converter-mounted generator is provided that, along with power<br>
electronics, offers at least two electrical power output voltages and may be attached to a<br>
transmission without impacting the axial length of a powertrain in comparison to a<br>
powertrain with an identical transmission and a torque converter not having a generator<br>
mounted thereto. Different torque-converter mounted generators and power electronics<br>
configurations providing different combinations of power output voltages may be offered<br>
for use with a given transmission type, thus allowing flexibility in meeting customer<br>
needs without unduly impacting assembly of the powertrains.<br>
[0004]	Specifically, a powertrain within the scope of the invention includes a<br>
transmission housed within a transmission housing, and a torque converter operatively<br><br>
connected with the transmission and housed within a torque converter housing. The<br>
torque converter housing is secured to the transmission housing. A generator with a<br>
rotor is secured to the torque converter. The generator also has a stator that is secured<br>
to the torque converter housing. Power electronics are operatively connected with the<br>
generator. The generator and power electronics are configured to provide electrical<br>
power at multiple voltages. Voltage may be a relatively low voltage required for<br>
powering onboard vehicle accessories, while another voltage may be at a relatively high<br>
voltage for offboard power needs. As used herein, "onboard" refers to components<br>
normally connected with the vehicle at all times, including when the vehicle is in<br>
motion, while "offboard" components are those not integral with the vehicle and<br>
typically connected to the vehicle only when it is stationary.<br>
[0005]	In some embodiments, the generator may generate electrical power at<br>
two or more different voltages, such as if the stator includes first and second sets of<br>
stator segments adapted to provide the two different electrical voltages. Alternatively,<br>
the generator may generate electrical power at only one voltage that is then converted to<br>
different voltages for electrical power output by different components of the power<br>
electronics.<br>
[0006]	In one embodiment, the power electronics are configured to provide<br>
electrical power to the stator to drive the rotor, thereby operating the generator in a<br>
motoring mode for starting the engine and/or providing torque to the transmission in<br>
tandem with the engine.<br>
[0007]	Within the scope of the invention, the design of the torque converter-<br>
mounted generator may vary widely. For example, the stator and rotor may be<br>
configured with a radial gap or an axial gap, in which case there may be two rotors<br>
concentrically arranged with the stator and axially spaced on either side of the stator.<br>
The stator may have windings and multi-phase power outputs. The rotor may include<br>
different sets of magnets.<br>
[0008'	A method of assembling powertrains includes installing a first torque<br>
converter-mounted generator on a first transmission of a first type, and operatively<br><br>
connecting a first configuration of power electronics to the first torque converter-<br>
mounted generator. The first torque converter-mounted generator and the first<br>
configuration of power electronics provide electrical power at least two different<br>
voltages. The method further includes installing a second torque converter-mounted<br>
generator on a second transmission of the first type, wherein the first transmission and<br>
the second transmission are substantially identical. The method further includes<br>
operatively connecting a second configuration of power electronics to the second torque<br>
converter-mounted generator. The second torque converter-mounted generator and the<br>
second configuration of power electronics provide electrical power voltages different<br>
than the two voltages provided by the first torque converter-mounted generator and the<br>
first configuration of power electronics. Notably, only one of the voltages provided by<br>
each of the powertrain embodiments need be different in order for the two voltages<br>
provided by each to be considered different (e.g., the first torque converter-mounted<br>
generator and first configuration of power electronics may offer a low voltage power of<br>
28 volts direct current, just as the second torque converter-mounted generator and<br>
second configuration of power electronics does, but different higher voltage power<br>
(e.g., 220 volts direct current versus 270 volts direct current) may be provided by the<br>
two embodiments. Preferably, the assembly of the transmissions with the different<br>
torque converters may occur on the same assembly line in a factory. Thus, customer<br>
needs for different types of electrical power may be addressed as the powertrains are<br>
assembled.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration in partial cross-sectional side view of<br>
a first powertrain including a transmission, and engine, a torque converter with a first<br><br>
type of generator mounted thereon, and power electronics, providing electrical power at<br>
two different voltages;<br>

[0012]	FIGURE 3 is a schematic illustration in partial cross-sectional side view of<br>
a second powertrain including a transmission of the same type of the transmission of<br>
Figure 1, an engine of the same type as the ending of Figure 1, and a torque converter<br>
with a second type of generator mounted thereon, and power electronics, providing<br>
electrical power at voltages different than the voltages provided by the generator of<br>
Figures 1 and 2; and<br>
[0013]	FIGURE 4 is a schematic illustration of a third powertrain including a<br>
transmission and an engine identical to those of Figure 3, and a torque converter<br>
without a gencrator mounted thereon.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, figure 1 shows a powertrain 10 that includes an engine 12, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine or a diesel engine. The powertrain 10 further includes a<br>
torque converter 14 housed within a torque converter housing 16 and a transmission 18<br>
hou -d within a transmission housing 20. The engine crankshaft 22 is connected with an<br>
input shell 26 of the torque converter 14 via a flex plate 24 or other interface secured by<br>
bolts 28 or other fastening mechanisms to the torque converter input shell 26. As is<br>
known, the torque converter 14 forms a fluid coupling between the engine 12 and the<br>
transmission 18, providing torque multiplication via an impeller or pump portion rotating<br>
with the input shell 26 that forms a viscous coupling with a turbine portion rotating with<br><br><br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms, such as synchronizers, clutches and/or brakes, to<br>
esta! ish torque transmission at various speed ratios to a transmission output member 31.<br>
[0015]	A torque converter-mounted generator 34 is provided that establishes,<br>
along with multiple sets of power electronics (discussed below) multiple power outputs<br>
for offboard and/or offboard power needs. The torque converter-mounted generator 34<br>
includes a rotor 36 secured to the torque converter 14, specifically, to the torque<br>
converter input shell 26 for rotation therewith. The generator 34 further includes a stator<br>
38 prented to the torque converter housing 16 such that the stator 38 remains stationary<br>
with the torque converter housing 16. The rotor 36 and stator 38 are concentrically<br>
arranged about an axis of rotation of the engine crankshaft 22 and the transmission input<br>
mender 30 and define a circumferential radial air gap 32 therebetween. The engine 12<br>
includes an engine block 40 secured by bolts 42 or other fasteners to the torque converter<br>
housing 16 The torque converter housing 16 is also secured by bolts 44 or other<br>
fasteners to the transmission housing 20. The engine block 40, torque converter housing<br>
16 and TRASMISSION housing 20 are stationary components. Preferably, the stator 38 is<br><br><br>
different than the first output voltage, as discussed below. The stator segments 46, 48 are<br>
bolted or otherwise secured to the torque converter housing 16 with bolts 54 as indicated.<br>
[0017]	The rotor 36 of the torque converter-mounted generator 34 has magnets 56<br>
circumferentially spaced therearound. The number of magnets 56 is selected to optimize<br>
the desired first and second output voltages. The rotor 36 is secured with bolts 58 or any<br>
other fastening method to the torque converter 14 so that it rotates with the torque<br>
converter 14. The bolts 58 are shown in an exemplary arrangement only, and may be of a<br>
different number, spacing, or location than that shown. The radial air gap 32 is shown<br>
between the stator segments 46 and 48, and the rotor 36.<br>
[0018]	When the engine crankshaft 22 turns, the input shell 26 and rotor 36 are<br>
turned. The magnetic flux of the rotating magnets 56 generates current flow in the<br>
windings 52 and 52A of stator 38.<br>
[0019]	Referring again to Figure 1, the powertrain 10 incorporates power<br>
electronics; specifically, a first set of power electronics 60 in electrical communication<br>
with the first set of stator segments 46 as well as a second set of power electronics 62 in<br>
electrical communication with the second set of stator segments 48. Together, the first<br>
and second types of power electronics 60, 62 may be referred to as a first configuration of<br>
power electronics. The first set of stator segments 46 and the first set of power<br>
electronics 62 are configured to provide electrical power at a first voltage, such as a<br>
relatively low 28 volt direct current (VDC). The second set of stator segments 48 and the<br>
second set of power electronics 62 are configured to provide electrical power at a second<br>
voltage, such as a relatively high 270 volt direct current. The first set, or lower voltage,<br>
power electronics 60 includes a first power connection 64 connected with the first set of<br>
stator segments 52 which can function as a first power output, The first power<br>
connection 64 communicates power to a low voltage power module 66, which includes<br>
an inverter and electronic controller. The low voltage power module 66 is operable to<br>
convert the three-phase alternating current provided by the first set of stator segments 52<br>
into power in the form of 28 volt direct current to be stored in a low voltage battery 68.<br>
The controller function of the power module 66 directs the battery 68 to provide energy<br>
to vehicle accessories 70 configured to function on power at the low voltage (e.g., 28<br><br>
Volt) level. The vehicle accessories 70 may include air conditioning, audio systems, and<br>
any other onboard or offboard electrically-powered components designed to run on the<br>
low voltage power provided by the first set of power electronics.<br>
[0020]	The second set of power electronics 62 includes a second power<br>
connection 72 that connects to the second set of stator segments 48 and functions as a<br>
second power output for the second, higher voltage, type of electrical power. The second<br>
power connection 72 communicates power to a high voltage rectifier and controller<br>
module 74 which functions as an export power rectifier and controller. The high voltage<br>
rectifier and controller module 74 is operable to convert the three-phase alternating<br>
current provided by the three-phase stator windings 52A into power in the form of 270<br>
volt direct current that is provided to an external power load 76 under the control of the<br>
controller portion of the high voltage rectifier and controller module 74. The external<br>
power load 76 may include, for example, offboard industrial and utility equipment or<br>
tools, or an onboard load, such as refrigeration for a trailer in transit.<br>
[0021]	Referring to Figure 3, a second embodiment of a powertrain 10A<br>
illustrates a second type of torque converter-mounted generator 34A utilized with an<br>
engine 12A and transmission 18A interconnected in the same manner as the<br>
corresponding components of Figure 1. In fact, the engine 12A is an identical type<br>
engine as engine 12 and the transmission 18A is an identical type transmission as the<br>
transmission 18. In the powertrain 10A however, the torque converter-mounted<br>
generator 34A is of a different configuration, providing different voltage outputs, than the<br>
torque converter-mounted generator 34. Thus, a transmission manufacturer can offer the<br>
transmission represented as 18 in Figure 1 and 18A in Figure 3, modified according to a<br>
customer's specific power output needs, by choosing one of the torque<br>
converter-mounted generators 34 or 34A, designed with customized low and high voltage<br>
outputs. Additionally, the transmission 18A may also be offered with a traditional torque<br>
converter 14B, i.e., one without a generator mounted thereon, as illustrated in Figure 4, as<br>
the traditional torque converter 14B and the torque converters with generators mounted<br>
thereon 14,14A, occupy essentially the same axial packaging space, with only a different<br>
torque converter housing required for each different design.<br><br>
[0022]	The engine 12A includes an engine block 40A secured by bolts 42A or<br>
other fasteners to the torque converter housing 16A. The torque converter housing 16A<br>
is also secured by bolts 44A or other fasteners to the transmission housing 20A. The<br>
engine block 40A, torque converter housing 16A and transmission housing 20A are<br>
stationary components.<br>
[0023]	Referring in more detail to Figure 3, the torque converter-mounted motor<br>
generator 34A is an axial gap air core generator that includes a stator 38A mounted to the<br>
torque converter housing 16A such that the stator 38A remains stationary with the torque<br>
converter housing 16A. The stator 38A includes multiple stator segments,<br>
circumferentially-spaced similar to those of Figure 3, allowing multiple stator segments<br>
for multiple voltage outputs at the same time with separate output terminals, as discussed<br>
below. The torque converter-mounted generator 34A also includes a first rotor 36A and a<br>
second rotor 36B secured to the torque converter HA, specifically, to the torque<br>
converter input shell 26A for rotation therewith. The rotors 36A, 36B and stator 38A are<br>
concentrically arranged about an axis of rotation of the engine crankshaft 22A and the<br>
transmission input member 30A, with the stator 38A sandwiched between the rotors 36A,<br>
36B such that axial air gaps 32A, 32B are defined between each of the rotors 36A, 36B<br>
and the stator 38A, respectively. Each rotor has two sets of magnets 56 A and 56B spaced<br>
circumferentially therearound, each set being characterized by different strengths,<br>
inducing different current flow in the axial core windings of the stator 38A. Different<br>
voltage outputs associated with the magnets 56A, 56B are utilized to provide different<br>
types of power for onboard and/or offboard use, as described below. Those skilled in the<br>
art readily understand the construction of axial gap air core generators.<br>
[0024]	The powertrain 10A incorporates a first set of power electronics 60A in<br>
electrical communication with the stator 38A via a first power connection 64A. The first<br>
set of power electronics 60A is configured for a first electrical power voltage, such as a<br>
lower voltage 24 volt direct current (VDC). The first set of power electronics 60A<br>
includes a low voltage power module 66A, including an inverter and an electronic<br>
controller, and a low voltage battery 68A operatively connected to vehicle accessories<br>
70A. The components of the first set of power electronics 60A are configured and<br><br>
function similar to those like components of the first set of power electronics 60 of the<br>
powertrain 10 of Figure 2, except that the low voltage power module provides 24 volt<br>
direct current to the battery 68A.<br>
[0025]	The powertrain 10A also incorporates a second set of power electronics<br>
62A in electrical communication with the stator 38A via a second power connection 72A.<br>
Together the first and second sets of power electronics 60A, 62A, may be referred to as a<br>
second configuration of power electronics. The second set of power electronics 60A is<br>
configured for a second electrical power voltage, such as a higher voltage 220 volt direct<br>
current. The second power connection 72A communicates power to a high voltage<br>
rectifier and controller module 74A which functions as an export power rectifier and<br>
controller. The high voltage rectifier and controller module 74A is operable to convert<br>
three-phase 220 volt alternating current provided by the stator 38A into power in the form<br>
of 220 volt direct current that is provided to an external power load 76A under the control<br>
of the controller portion of the high voltage rectifier and controller module 74A. The<br>
external power load 76A may include, for example, offboard industrial and utility<br>
equipment of tools, or an onboard load, such as refrigeration for a trailer in transit. These<br>
components of the second set of power electronics 62A are configured and function<br>
similar to those like components of the second set of power electronics 62 of the<br>
powertrain 10 of Figure 1, except that the high voltage rectifier and controller module<br>
74A provides power at 220V to the external power load 76A.<br>
[0026]	The second set of power electronics 62A also includes componentry<br>
enabling the torque converter-mounted generator 34A to function as a motor to start the<br>
engine 12A or to provide power in tandem with the engine 12A to the transmission<br>
18A, providing hybrid propulsion capability. Thus, the torque converter-mounted<br>
generator 34A may be referred to as a motor/generator. Specifically, the second set of<br>
power electronics 62A includes a high voltage alternating current to direct current<br>
power module 80A that functions as a power inverter and as an electronic controller to<br>
invert power from a high voltage alternating current, such as 220 volts alternating<br>
current, to a high voltage direct current, such as 220 volts direct current. The high<br>
voltage direct current is then stored in a high voltage battery 82A. A high voltage<br><br>
electronic controller 84A is configured to direct stored energy from the battery 82A to<br>
the stator 38A when operating conditions warrant starting the engine 12A, or when the<br>
engine 12A is already powering the transmission 18A and additional torque is required<br>
and may be provided by the motor/generator 34A. It should be appreciated that the<br>
direct current power module 80A, the battery 82A and the high voltage electronic<br>
controller 84A may also be employed on the powertrain 10 of Figure 2 such that the<br>
torque converter-mounted generator 34 could also function as a motor.<br>
[0027]	As indicated in Figures 2 and 3, different powertrains may be<br>
constructed with the same type of transmission and engine, but with different torque<br>
converter-mounted generators connected therebetween. The choice of torque<br>
converter-mounted generator in terms of the power outputs it is configured to provide<br>
may be driven by specific customer needs. Alternatively, if onboard or offboard power<br>
is not required for a specific powertrain implementation, a powertrain 10B, configured<br>
as shown in Figure 4, may be provided with an engine 12B, a transmission 18B and a<br>
torque converter 14B, within a torque converter housing 16B, that is not equipped with<br>
a generator. The engine 12B may be of the same type as engines 12 and 12A, and the<br>
transmission 18B may be of the same type as transmissions 18 and 18A.<br>
[0028]	Preferably, the power outputs of the various generators 34, 34A are<br>
common and the power electronics 60, 62, 60A, 62A are common, so that the<br>
generators and power electronics can be used for various different types of<br>
transmissions as well. Various power electronic configurations, including those of the<br>
following electric power voltages, are preferably available for connection to the<br>
common power outputs of the generators 34, 34A: 600 Volts DC, 12 Volts DC, 42<br>
Volts DC, 110/220 Volts (60 Hz) alternating current "AC", 220 Volts (50 Hz AC), 24<br>
Volts DC and 270 Volts DC.<br>
[0029]	Accordingly, a method of assembling powertrains, described with<br>
respect to the powertrain embodiments of Figures 1-4, includes installing a first torque<br>
converter-mounted generator 34 on a first transmission 18 of a first type. This may<br>
include attaching a torque converter housing 16 to a transmission housing 20. The<br><br>
method further includes operatively connecting a first configuration of power<br>
electronics 60, 62 to the first torque converter-mounted generator 34, The first torque<br>
converter-mounted generator 34 and the first configuration of power electronics 60, 62<br>
provide electric power at at least two voltages (e.g., 28VDC and 270 VDC).<br>
[0030]	The method also includes installing a second torque converter-mounted<br>
generator 34A on a second transmission 18A of the first type that is substantially<br>
identical to the first transmission 18. This may include attaching a different torque<br>
converter housing 16A to a transmission housing 20A that is identical to the<br>
transmission housing 20. The method then includes operatively connecting a second<br>
configuration of power electronics 60A, 62A, to the second torque converter-mounted<br>
generator 34A. The second torque converter-mounted generator 34A and the second<br>
configuration of power electronics 60A, 62A provide electric power at voltages<br>
different than the two voltages provided by the first torque converter-mounted generator<br>
34 and the first configuration 60, 62 of power electronics. Within the scope of the<br>
method, a torque converter 14B that does not have a generator mounted thereon may be<br>
connected with a transmission 18B identical to the transmissions 18 and 18A and with<br>
an engine 12B identical to the engines 12 and 12A. Thus, the method enables a given<br>
transmission and engine combination to be connected with different torque converters<br>
(with different types of generators, a motor/generator, or no generator mounted thereto)<br>
and different power electronic configurations (or no power electronics in the case of a<br>
torque converter without a generator) to meet a customer's specific electrical power<br>
needs.<br>
