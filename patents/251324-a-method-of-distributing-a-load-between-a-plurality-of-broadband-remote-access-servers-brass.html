:DIRECTED PPPoE SESSION INITIATION<br>
OVER A SWITCHED ETHERNET"<br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (publ),<br>
a Swedish Company, of S-164 83 Stockholm,<br>
SWEDEN.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
DIRECTED PPPoE SESSION INITIATION OVER A SWITCHED ETHERNET<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to communications networks, specifically methods<br>
and systems directed at establishing Point-to-point Protocol over Ethernet<br>
sessions over a switched Ethernet network.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Point-to Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) provides the ability to connect a network of hosts over a simple bridging access device to a remote access concentrator. With this model, each host utilizes its own PPP (Point-to Point Protocol) stack and the user is presented with a famifiar user interface. For instance, a host could be a personal computer at a client's premises and an<br>
access concentrator could be a Broadband Remote Access Servers ("BRAS"). Access control, biffing and type of service can be done on a per-user rather than<br>
a per-site, basis.<br>
The general procedure for a point-to-point connection over Ethernet is described in the IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force - Networking Working Group Request for Comments 2516 "A Method for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet" ("RFC 2516"), which ts incorporated by reference in its entirety into this<br>
application. To provide a point-to-point connection, RFC 2516 provides for two<br>
stages for each PPPoE session. There is a discovery stage and a PPP session<br>
stage. When a host wishes to initiate a PPPoE session, it first performs "discovery" to identify the Ethernet MAC address of the peer and establishes a PPPoE session ID. White PPP defines a peer-to-peer relationship, the discovery stage is inherently a client-server relationship. In the discovery stage, a host (the client) discovers an access concentrator (the server). Depending on the network, there may be more than one access concentrator which may communicate with the host The discovery stage allows the host to discover all available access concentrators so that it may then select one. Thus, when the discovery stage is completed successfully, both the host and the selected access concentrator have the information they will use to build a Point-to Point connection over Ethernet<br><br>
	access concentrator have the information they will use to build a Point-to Point connection over Ethernet The Discovery stage remains stateless until a PPP session is established. Once a PPP session is established, both the host and the access concentrator allocate the resources so that a PPP virtual interface can be established. After completion of the discovery stage, both peers know the PPPoE session identifier and the other peer's Ethernet address, which together define the PPPoE session uniquely.<br>
There are typically four steps to the discovery stage. The steps consist of: (1) the host broadcasting an initiation message or packet, (2) one or more access concentrators sending Offer packets or responses, (3) the host sending a unicast Session Request packet to the selected access concentrator, and (4) the selected access concentrator sending a confirmation packet to the host When the host receives the confirmation packet, it may proceed to the PPP Session Stage. Similarly. when the access concentrator sends the confirmation packet, rt may proceed to the PPP Session Stage.<br>
The initiation message sent by the host will be a PPPoE Active Discovery<br>
Initiation ("PADI") packet The initiation message is a broadcast message. For purposes of this Application, the term "Broadcast" is a communication between a single device and every member of a device group. "Multicast" on the other hand, is a communication between a single device and a selected group of members of a device group. So the destination address will be set to a broadcast address. The PAD) packet will also contain one service-name TAG, indicating the service the host is requesting, and any number of other TAG types. When an access concentrator receives a PAD! that it can serve, it replies by sending a PPPoE Active Discovery Offer ("PADO") packet The destination address is the unicast address of the host that initially sent the PADI. The PADO packet contains the access concentrator's name, a service-name TAG identical to the one in the PADI, and any number of other service-name TAGs indicating other services that the access concentrator offers. If the access concentrator cannot serve the PADI, it does not respond with a PADO.<br><br><br><br><br>
Since the PADI was a broadcast message, the host may receive more<br>
than one PADO responses. The host looks through the PADO packets it<br>
receives and chooses one. Typically, the choice can be based on the AC-Name<br>
or the Services offered. The host then sends a PPPoE Active Discovery<br>
5 Request ("PADR") packet to the access concentrator that it has chosen. The<br>
destination address is set to the unicast Ethernet address of the selected access<br>
concentrator or server.<br><br>
One purpose of deploying multiple access concentrators or "BRAS" within the same broadcast domain is for load sharing and redundancy. Access concentrator redundancy is an inherent feature of this architecture. However, no existing scheme supports inherent load distribution between the access concentrators. In principle, afl access concentrators will answer the PADI packet with a PADO packet and the first (acceptable) PADO frame that reaches the PPPoE client will determine the access concentrator with which the session is established - regardless of the existing toad on the selected access concentrators. Thus, some access concentrators could be fully loaded while other available access concentrators could be lightly loaded.<br><br>
What is needed, therefore, is a method or system that can distribute the load among multiple access concentrators.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
The previously mentioned needs are fulfilled with the various aspects of<br>
present invention. One aspect of the present invention directs the broadcast initiation message or PAD! towards a specific access concentrator (which may be lightly loaded relative to the other access concentrators). For instance, in one variation of this aspect, an Ethernet access node monitors the load on the access concentrators. When an initial broadcast message is received, it is converted into a unicast frame by the Ethernet access node, and sent directly to the specific access concentrator (e.g., with the lightest load). In another variation of this aspect, a mediation device may monitor the load on the access concentrators. Additionally, all initiation messages may be sent to a mediation device, so that the mediation device may direct the initiation message to a selected access server. In yet nother aspect, the access concentrators evaluate their own load, and wait a redetermined amount of time before responding to the initiation message. The length of the predetermined time is dependent upon tire current load on the access concentrator, tn this aspect, the host will choose the first access concentrator that replies. Because atl access concentrator's watt before responding depends on the amount of current load on the access concentrator, the tightest loaded access concentrator will typically respond first<br>
Thus, with different aspects of the present invention, load sharing may be enabled for an Ethernet access network with multiple access concentrators in a<br>
simple and dynamic way. Load requests and/or information may flow directly between Ethernet access nodes and an access concentrator, or a mediation<br>
device may be applied if appropriate. By using a mediation device for collecting the load information, the solution facilitates load snaring between multiple access concentrators from different vendors without having to modify the functionality of these different access concentrators (provided that the access concentrator can be audited regarding its current load status).<br>
These and other features, and advantages, will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings. It is important to note the drawings are not intended to<br>

Tunning now to Fig. 1a, there is illustrated a system 100 which employs<br>
certain aspects of the present invention. In this illustrative example, the system 100 comprises a switched Ethernet access network 102 having a plurality of Ethernet access nodes 104a and 104b placed on the boundary between the Ethernet access network 102 and a local loop 106 of an end-user. The Ethernet access nodes 104a and 104b may be, for instance, Ethernet-centric IP DSLAMs<br>
or Ethernet switches. A plurality of access concentrators, or in this example,<br>
BRASs 108a, 108b, and 108c are also coupled to the Ethernet access network 102. Each of the BRASs 108a-108c are coupled to additional network resources or networks which are represented by clouds 11 Oa, 11 Ob. and 110c, respectively (which could, hi fact be the same network). Customer subscriber equipment, such as Customer Premises Equipment Modems 112a and 112b, may be in communication with the Ethernet access node 104a in a conventional manner.<br><br>
In this example, it is assumed that the BRASs 108a-108c continuously<br>
monitor their own status, e.g. regarding the current load. Thus, the values of these status parameters may form the basis for selecting the preferred BRAS for a given PPPoE session. Fig. 2 illustrates a general process 200 which might implement one embodiment of the present invention. In step 202, the process begins. In step 204, information regarding the toad status of each BRASs 108a- 108c is received by a network node (e.g., Ethernet access node 104a). The load status is used to build or maintain a database of the load status of the BRASs108a-108c (step 206). Thus, in step 208, when a PPPoE session initiation message is received from a host (e.g., CPE modem 1l2a) the network node may select which of the BRASs 108a-108c should handle the request by analyzing the database (step 210). In a PPPoE access scenario, for instance, a service Name TAG may be used by the host to request a specific service. Thus, the node selecting the BRAS may also verify that the requested service is available on the selected BRAS. The network node may team the capacity of the BRAS by either with pre- configuration routines or dynamically (e.g., when the load status is conveyed).<br>
in step 212, the broadcast session initiation message may be converted<br>
to a unicast message directed only to the selected BRAS. In step 214, the unicast message is then forwarded on to the selected BRAS and the discovery stage continues in a conventional manner (step 216).<br>
In Fig. 3, there is illustrated an example network node 120 which may implement the process 200 described above or any other process described in<br>
this Application. The network node 120 may be an Ethernet access node 104a-<br>
104b, a BRAS, or another type of network node (such as a mediation device). As is well known in the art, the network node 120 includes a processor 122 coupled to at least one memory means 124. The processor 122 may be also coupled to at least one interface 126 for communicating with a network 128. The interface 126 receives data streams from the network 128 and translates the data streams into a format readable by the processor 122. The processor 122 may then act upon the data according to processes or instructions 130 stored in the memory 124. After processing, the modified data streams are sent out through the interface 126 to another network node or resource.<br>
A First Example:<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the load status of each of the BRASs 108a -108c may be conveyed to the Ethernet access nodes 104a and<br>
104b as indicated in Fig. 1b. For example, at predefined and/or configurable intervals, each of the BRASs 108a-108c broadcasts messages to the Ethernet<br>
access nodes 104a and 104b informing the nodes of the load status for the<br>
respective BRAS. Alternatively, each Ethernet access nodes 104a and 104b<br>
could poll or audit each of the BRASs 108a-108c, using unicast messages 116,<br>
to obtain the respective load status as indicated in Fig. 1c. Polling may, for example, be performed at a predefined interval, or when a new PPPoE session<br>
is initiated, m some embodiments, polHng may be implemented using SNMP.<br><br>
In any event, each Ethernet access node 104a-104b builds a list or<br>
database of available BRASs (e.g., BRASs 108a and 108c). For instance, rf<br>
load information is not received nor can be retrieved from one of the BRASs <br>
during a pre-specified amount of time, that BRAS may be pulled out of the<br>
database. Among other information, the database may contain the corresponding address information of the BRASs (e,g., the MAC address) in addition to the load information. This database is updated whenever new information is received from the BRASs 108a-108c.<br>
As discussed previously, when a host, for instance, the CPE modem 112 a wishes to establish a new PPPoE session, the CPE modem 112a begins<br>
the discovery stage by sending a broadcast initiation message (e.g., "PADI") to<br>
the BRASs 108a-108c. This message may be intercepted by the Ethernet access node 104, which as previously discussed, is aware of the current load status for each of the BRAS 108a-108c. The Ethernet access node 104a selects which BRASs 108a-108c to direct the request based on the relative load status of all the BRAS and the service requested. Then, the Ethernet access node 104a changes the destination address of the PADI from the Ethernet broadcast address to the MAC address of the selected BRAS (e.g., BRAS 30 108b), before a modified message 118 is sent upstream into the Ethernet access network, as indicated in Fig. 1d. Only the selected BRAS 108b will receive the PADI, Thus, only the selected BRAS 108b will answer the PADI with a response message (e.g, a "PADO"). The BRAS 108b may then send a PADO to the MAC address of the CPE modem 112a. The discovery stage and the PPP session stage may then proceed in a conventional manner,<br><br>
5 A Second Example Using a Mediation Device:<br>
Alternatively, other embodiments might use a mediation device such as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4a. In Rg. 4a, there is illustrated an example system 140, which is simitar to the system 100 of Fig. 1 a except that a mediation device 142 is employed. For brevity and clarity, a description of those components which are identical or similar to those described in connection with the example illustrated in Figs. 1a-1d will not be repeated here. Reference should be made to the foregoing paragraphs with the following description to arrive at a complete understanding of this example.<br>
In this example, the load status of each of the BRASs 108a -108c may be conveyed to the mediation device 142. For example, at predefined intervals, each of the BRAS 108a-108c sends messages to the mediation device 142<br>
indicating the load status for the respective BRAS. Alternatively, the mediation<br>
device 142 could poll or audit each of the BRASs 108a-108c, using unicast<br>
messages, to obtain the respective load status. Polling may, for example, be performed at a predefined interval, or when a new PPPoE session is initiated. In<br>
either case, the mediation device 142 builds a list or database of available BRASs (e.g., BRASs 108a and 108c), and stores the corresponding address information (e.g., the MAC address) in addition to the toad information. This database is updated whenever new information is received from the BRASs 25 108a-108c.<br>
As discussed previously, when a host, for instance, the CPE modem<br>
112 a wishes to establish a new PPPoE session, the CPE modem 112a begins<br>
the discovery stage by sending a broadcast initiation message (e.g.,"PADI") to<br>
the BRASs 108a-108c. The PADI may be intercepted by the Ethernet access node 104a. The Ethernet access node 104a then forwards the PADI to the mediation device 142 (e.g., by replacing the destination broadcast address of the initiation PADI frame with a unicast MAC address of the mediation device 142). In some embodiments, there may be a mediation device cluster (not shown). In such embodiments, the destination broadcast address of the PADI frame may then be replaced by a predefined multicast address of the Mediation Device cluster. In yet other embodiments, a separate mediation device VLAN, isolated from the access concentrators could be employed. When the mediation device receives the PADI 144, the mediation device 142 analyze the database to determine the most recent load status for each of the BRASs 108a-108c. The mediation device 142 then selects which BRASs 108a-108c to direct the PADI based on the relative load status of all the BRAS and the service requested. Then, the mediation device 142 changes the destination address of the PADI 144 from the MAC address of the mediation device to the MAC address of the selected BRAS (e.g., BRAS 108b), before the modified message 146 is sent upstream into the Ethernet access network, as indicated hi Fig. 4b. Only the selected BRAS (e.g., BRAS 108b) will receive the PADI. Thus, only the selected BRAS 108b will answer the PADI with a response message (e.g. a PADO). The BRAS 108b may then send a PADO to the MAC address of the CPE modem 112a, The discovery stage and the PPP session<br>
stage may then proceed in a conventional manner.<br>
A Third Example:<br>
Combinations of the above embodiments are possible and are within the scope of the present invention. For instance, in one embodiment the mediation<br>
device 142 may not build or maintain the BRAS load database, but just acts as a<br>
toad information distributor. Such an embodiment is illustrated hi Fig. 4c where the load status of each of the BRASs 108a -108c may be conveyed to the<br>
mediation device 142 as indicated. For example, at predefined intervals, each of<br>
the BRASs 108a-108c sends messages to the mediation device 142 and<br>
informs the mediation device of the toad status for the respective BRAS.<br>
Alternatively, the mediation device 142 could poll or audit each of the BRASs 108a-108c, using unicast messages 148, to obtain the respective load status.<br>
At predefined intervals, this information is sent to the Ethernet access nodes<br>
104a and 104b which builds a Hst or database of available BRAS (e.g., BRASs 108a and 108c), and stores the corresponding address information (e.g., the MAC address) in addition to the load information.<br><br>
Thus, the Ethernet access nodes 104a-104b in this embodiment,<br>
functions similar to the embodiment discussed in reference to Figs. 1a-1d. As discussed previously, when a host, for instance the CPE modem 112a, wishes<br>
to establish a new PPPoE session, the CPE modem 112a begins the discovery<br>
stage by sending a broadcast initiation message (e.g., a PADI) to the BRASs<br>
108a-108c. This message may be intercepted by the Ethernet access node<br>
104a which as previously discussed, is aware of the current load status for each of the BRASa 108a-108c. The Ethernet access node 104a selects which<br>
BRASs 108a-108c to direct the request based on the relative toad status of all<br>
the BRASs and the service requested. Then, the Ethernet access node 104a<br>
changes the destination address of the PAD! from the Ethernet broadcast<br>
address to the MAC address of the selected BRAS (e.g., BRAS 108b), before the modified message is sent upstream into the Ethernet access network. Only<br>
the selected BRAS 108b will receive the PADI, Thus, only the selected BRAS<br>
108b will answer the PAD) with a response message (e.g, PADO). The BRAS<br>
108b may then send a PADO to the MAC address of the CPE modem 112a.<br>
The discovery stage and the PPP session stage then proceed in a conventional manner.<br>
A Fourth Example without Using Pie-sampling<br>
Polling or broadcasting access concentrator load information (i.e.,<br>
sampling) may increase the overall toad on the network. Thus, the frequency of the polling or broadcasting may be limited by overall network capacity. On the<br>
other hand, increasing the frequency of the sampling increases the accuracy of<br>
the load distribution. The load distribution analysis is likely to be performed<br>
using historic data. If the period between sampling is too long, traffic may be<br>
directed toward single BRAS - resulting in a high load situation for the selected BRAS. Thus, the sampling frequency may be balanced against the<br>
overall load on the network. Additionally, the BRASs may belong to an ISP that is another company than the Network Access provider , tn this situation , there may need to be bridging between the management networks. Yet, for security reasons, many operators may not want to share their management networks.<br><br><br>
In one embodiment a mediation device could distribute the load by a simple "round robin" approach without the need for pre-sampting or exchanging<br>
management information. In another embodiment a mediation device could<br>
use a round robin strategy with a load distribution scheme to assure that access<br>
concentrator are not too loaded if the sampling frequency is relatively long.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention may be implemented without theuse of sampling or sharing of management information between competing<br>
operating companies. In mis aspect, the host (le., the PPPoE session initiator)<br>
selects the first access concentrator that replies with a RADO (assuming the<br>
service requirements of the host are met). In this embodiment however, the access concentrators sends a PADO as reply to the PADI only after waiting a<br>
predetermined period of time, where the predetermined period of time depends<br>
on the toad on the access concentrator. Thus, when the load on the access<br>
concentrator is heavy, the response time will be relatively long. Similarly, when<br>
the load on the access concentrator is light the response time will be relatively short<br>
Load sharing among the access concentrators, therefore, may be<br>
accomplished in a simple and elegant way. This embodiment allows the host to<br>
select the access concentrator with the lowest load without the need tor pre-<br>
sampling or maintaining a database. Thus, no management traffic needs to flow between the BRASs and the general access network, including the Ethernet<br>
Access Devices or even the CPE modems.<br>
Turning now to fig. 5, which illustrates a general process 220 which might implement one embodiment of the present invention. In step 222, the process begins. In step 224, an initiation message (e.g., a PADI) is received from a host In response, the network node receiving the initiation message determines the current load on the node (step 226). In step 228, the node waits a predetermined period of time before responding to the initiation message. The magnitude of this predetermined period is dependent on the load on the system.<br>
In step 230, the node then sends the appropriate response message (e.g., a<br>
PADO) and the discovery stage continues in a conventional manner (step 232).<br>
The exact functional relationship between the access concentrator load and PADl-PADO response time may depend on a number of factors, tn some cases,<br>
the response time may simply be a linear relationship to the CPU load. In other<br>
cases, the access concentrator may simply stop replying to PAD! (e.g., if it<br>
cannot support any additional PPP sessions). In several embodiments, all<br>
access concentrators would use the same functional relationship to provide for consistent response times among the access concentrators.<br><br>
Additionally, it is may be preferred that the network delay from each<br>
access concentrator to the host be either insignificant or approximately equal.<br>
This may be accomplished by having the access concentrators physically<br>
located almost an equal distance from the host<br>
if both the host and the access concentrator adhere to the protocol described in this example, load sharing among the access concentrators will<br>
happen automatically. However, if there are uncertainties of whether either the<br>
host or the access concentrator will adhere to these protocols, the network can<br>
be upgraded to enforce this policy. One enforcement mechanism can be discussed with reference to the network Illustrated in Fig. 1a. As previously<br>
discussed, the host (e.g. the CPE modem 112a) selects the response message<br>
or PADO received that turfite the service requirement If the network operator is<br>
uncertain about whether all CPE equipment are adapted to perform this function,<br>
the host role policy can be enforced by the Ethernet access node 104a. To enforce the host selection policy, the Ethernet access node may perform the<br>
following procedure:<br>
1) Intercept alt PAD! requests from the CPE side and<br>
record the source MAC address of the CPE modem 112a<br>
before forwarding the PAD! to the BRASs 108a-108c.<br>
(2) Forward only the first received PADO from the BRASs to the CPE Modem 112a. <br>
	This procedure is appropriate if all the BRASs offer the same services).<br>
	(A Fifth Example Using a Mediation Device, but No Presampling:<br>
An enforcement mechanism may also be implemented on the BRAS side<br>
of the network. As previously discussed, the BRASs wait a predetermined time<br>
5 before responding. If the access network operator is uncertain about whether<br>
the BRASs are programmed with this feature, the network operator may change<br>
the network topology to assure compliance with this policy. Such a network<br>
topology is illustrated in Fig. 6.<br><br>
In Fig. 6, there is illustrated an example system 160, which is similar to the system 100 of Fig. 1a except that a mediation device 162 is employed to separate a BRAS duster 164 from the Ethernet access network 102. For brevity and clarity, a description of those components which are identical or similar to those described in connection with the example illustrated in Figs. 1a wHI not be repealed here. Reference should be made to the foregoing paragraphs with the following description to arrive at a complete understanding of this example.<br><br>
Thus, in this example, the BRAS*s role policy can be enforced by the<br>
mediation device 162. To enforce the BRAS policy, the mediation device 162<br>
may perform the following procedure:<br>
	(1)		Intercept all PADI requests from the CPE side and<br>
20 record the source MAC address of the CPE modem 112a<br>
before forwarding the PADI to the BRASs 108a-108c.<br>
(2)	Forward only the first received PADO from the<br>
BRASs to the CPE Modem 112a.<br><br>
As in previous examples, this procedure is appropriate if all the BRASs offer the same service(s). In several embodiments, the load factors may vary depending the type and manufacturer of the BRAS. Load factors may include GPU toad, memory consumption, number of simultaneous PPP sessions, on or a combination of some of these factors. Currently, there is no standardized procedure known to the inventors to poll a BRAS to determine a standardized load on the BRAS. Depending on the model and brand of the BRAS, important load factors may be CPU toad, memory consumption, number of simultaneous PPP sessions, etc., or some combination of these factors. However, which toad factor affects The performance of the BRAS may be known only to the manufacturer of the BRAS. Additionally, the procedures for determining the toad on the BRAS may also vary from BRAS type to BRAS type. However, for an accurate toad distribution, the 5 BRASs should use the same toad determination procedures. Alternatively, the mediation device may be pre-configured with information on each BRAS so that it knows how to interpret the response times.<br><br>
This Application is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention<br>
to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Those stalled in the art will readily appreciate that<br>
many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments.<br>
For example, in one embodiment there is presented a method including: receiving information regarding the toad status of each access concentrator,<br>
building a database of the load status of each access concentrator based on the received information, receiving a session initiation message from a host,<br>
selecting an access concentrator based on the toad status indicated in the<br>
database, modifying the session initiation message so that it is addressed to the<br>
selected access concentrator, and forwarding the modified message to the<br>
selected access concentrator,<br>
Additional embodiments may also include verifying that a requested service is available on the selected access concentrator. The network node may learn of the availability of the access concentrators with either with pre- configuration routines or dynamically (e.g., when the toad status is conveyed).<br>
