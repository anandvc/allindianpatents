[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field Pertinent to the Invention]<br>
The invention relates to a cam assembly which is used for on/off (opening/closure) control or the like of, for example, an exhaust valve or an intake valve of an internal combustion engine and to a cam positioning apparatus which is used for positioning a plate cam provided for such a cam assembly. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
Hitherto, as shown in Fig. 12, a cam assembly 4 made of metal and formed by assembling two plate cams 2 and a gear 3 onto a cam shaft 1 is generally used as rotating means in an internal combustion engine of, for example, a motorcycle or the like. The cam assembly 4 which is used in the internal combustion engine as mentioned above is constructed in a manner such that the plate cams 2 whose outlines are formed in an arc-cam-shape are coaxially assembled in a state where attaching phases are deviated in the circumferential direction of the cam shaft 1 by a predetermined angle.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the case of assembling such a cam assembly 4, for example, the plate cams 2 formed by punching work and the gear 3 are positioned and held while aligning their shaft through-holes 5, particularly, the plate cams 2 are positioned while deviating the attaching phases in the circumferential direction of the cam shaft by the predetermined angle, and the cam shaft 1 is inserted into the common shaft through-holes 5 by pressure, thereby assembling. [0004]<br>
When such a cam assembly is used in the internal combustion engine, although not shown, a timing gear on a crank shaft which is rotated synchronously with an engine cycle is come into engagement with the gear 3, thereby rotating the cam shaft 1 and rotating the plate cams 2 in accordance with the rotation of the cam shaft 1. An on/off control of an exhaust valve or an intake valve corresponding to them is performed. [0005] [Problem to be solved by the Invention]<br>
However, hitherto, upon assembling of such a cam shaft 4, when the plate cams 2 are positioned onto the cam shaft 1 in a state where the attaching phases are deviated by the predetermined angle, a positional deviation is likely to occur in the plate cams 2 and a predetermined phase difference between the cams is not obtained.  If the cam<br>
shaft 1 is inserted by pressure in a state where they are deviated, assembling precision of the plate cams 2 to the cam shaft 1 deteriorates. Thus, when the cam operates, abutting states of cam surfaces 2a to a follower such as a valve or the like are not aligned or contact positions are deviated, so that working precision deteriorates and it is difficult to improve durability of the cam.<br>
[0006]<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the invention to solve the problems as mentioned above, position and hold two plate cams of different phases at a predetermined phase difference without deviation, and improve assembling precision of the plate cams to a cam shaft.<br>
[0007] [Means for Solving Problem]<br>
To accomplish the above object, according to the invention disclosed in Claim 1, for example, as shown in an embodiment which will be explained hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, there is provided a cam positioning apparatus A for positioning and holding first and second plate cams 10 and 11 made of metal while deviating attaching phases in a circumferential direction of a cam<br>
shaft 12 by a predetermined angle a when a cam assembly C is assembled by inserting the cam shaft 12 by pressure into shaft through-holes 22 formed in the first and second plate cams 10 and 11, characterized by comprising: a first cam positioning tool 24 which forms a positioning hole 31 that<br>
has almost the same shape as an outer shape of the first plate cam 10 and in that a seating surface S of the first plate cam 10 is formed on a bottom portion and, when the first plate cam 10 is positioned and held, fits the first plate cam 10 into the positioning hole 31, and puts the first plate cam onto the seating surface S; a second cam positioning tool 25 which forms a positioning hole 31 that has almost the same shape as an outer shape of the second plate cam 11 and in that a seating surface S of the plate cam 11 is formed on a bottom portion and, when the second plate cam 11 is positioned and held, fits the plate cam 11 into the positioning hole 31, and puts the plate cam onto the seating surface S; and a positioning base plate 26 which arranges the positioning holes 31 to relative positions<br>
which are deviated by the predetermined angle a in accordance with a phase difference between the plate cams 10 and 11, thereby fixing the first and second cam positioning tools 24 and 25. [0008]<br>
Therefore, according to the invention disclosed in Claim 1, upon assembling of the cam assembly, when the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are fitted into the positioning holes 31 with the predetermined phase difference a and the cam shaft 12 is inserted into the shaft through-holes 22 by pressure, respectively, both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are assembled at predetermined attaching phases on the cam shaft 12 which are away in the<br>
circumferential direction by the angle a corresponding to the phase difference.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 2, in the cam positioning apparatus A disclosed in Claim 1, for example, as shown in an embodiment which will be explained hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, the cam positioning apparatus is characterized by comprising: vacuum devices P which suck air in spaces between the positioning holes 31 and the plate cams 10 and 11 fitted therein from lower portions of the seating surfaces S through air passages 32, respectively; and vacuum degree detecting apparatuses T which detect vacuum degrees in the spaces between the positioning holes 31 and the plate cams 10 and 11 and confirm adhesion degrees of the plate cams 10 and 11 to the seating surfaces S from the detected vacuum degrees, respectively.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 3, for example, as shown in an embodiment which will be explained hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, there is provided a cam assembly C formed by inserting a cam shaft by pressure into shaft through-holes 22 formed in first and second plate cams 10 and 11 made of metal and coaxially assembling the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 while deviating attaching phases in a circumferential direction of the cam shaft 22 by a predetermined angle a,<br>
characterized in that: a convex portion 10c (14a) is formed on one of plate surfaces of each of the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 and a concave portion lOd (14b) is formed on the other plate surface at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion; the convex and concave portions 10c and lOd are formed on one of the plate cams, for example, the first plate cam 10 at positions which are away from attaching phases of the convex and concave portions of the other plate cam, for example, the second plate cam 11 by an angle corresponding to the phase<br>
difference a; and both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are coupled and integrated by fitting the concave portion lOd and the convex portion 14a.<br>
[0011]<br>
Therefore, according to the invention disclosed in Claim 3, when the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are coupled by fitting the concave portion lOd and the convex portion 14a, both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are preliminarily positioned at predetermined relative positions which are away by the angle corresponding to the predetermined phase difference a and integrated. Therefore, when the cam assembly C is assembled by inserting the cam shaft 12 into the shaft through-holes 22 by pressure, the plate cams 10 and 11 are positioned with the predetermined phase difference a without a deviation and assembled onto the cam shaft 12.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 4, for example, as shown in an embodiment which will be explained hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, there is provided a cam assembly C formed by inserting a cam shaft 12 by pressure into shaft through-holes 22 formed in first and second plate cams 10 and 11 made of metal and coaxially assembling the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 while deviating attaching phases in a circumferential<br>
direction of the cam shaft 12 by a predetermined angle a, characterized in that: the cam assembly has a coupling plate 35 which couples the first and second plate cams 10 and 11; a convex portion 14a is formed on one of plate surfaces of each of the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 and a concave portion 14b is formed on the other plate surface at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion; concave and convex portions 36a, 36b, and 37b which are fitted into/onto the concave and convex portions 14a and 14b of both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are formed on the coupling plate 35 at relative positions which are away<br>
by an angle corresponding to a phase difference a of both of the plate cams 10 and 11, respectively; and both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are laminated and integrated by fitting the concave and convex portions through the coupling plate 35.<br>
[0013]<br>
Therefore, according to the invention disclosed in Claim 4, on one of the plate surfaces of the coupling<br>
plate 35, the first plate cam 10 is laminated by fitting the convex portion 36a and the concave portion 14b, and on the other plate surface, the second plate cam 11 is laminated by fitting the concave portion 37a and the concave portion 14a and coupled. Thus, both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are previously positioned at the predetermined relative positions which are away by the angle<br>
corresponding to the predetermined phase difference a and integrated. Therefore, when the cam assembly C is assembled by inserting the cam shaft 12 into the shaft through-holes 22 by pressure, the plate cams 10 and 11 are<br>
positioned with the predetermined phase difference a without a deviation and assembled onto the cam shaft 12. [0014] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. [0015]<br>
Fig. 7 shows an assembling apparatus having a cam positioning apparatus of the invention. This assembling apparatus is means for assembling, for example, a cam assembly C shown in Fig. 6 as a finished product. [0016]<br>
The cam assembly C is rotating means made of metal which is used in, for example, an internal combustion engine for a motorcycle and constructed in a manner such that first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are assembled onto a cam<br>
shaft 12 while deviating attaching phases in the circumferential direction of the cam shaft 12 by a predetermined angle and one gear 13 is similarly assembled onto the cam shaft 12. Particularly, the plate cams 10 and 11 are punched and formed by using, for example, a fine blanking method. Also shown in Fig. 5, each plate cam is formed in an arc-cam-shape having an extending portion 14 which extends outwardly in one direction from a shaft through-hole 22. A cylindrical convex portion 14a is formed on one of plate surfaces and a cylindrical concave portion 14b is formed on the other plate surface at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion 14a. When the cam assembly is used, a timing gear on a crank shaft which is rotated synchronously with an engine cycle is come into engagement with the gear 13, thereby rotating the cam shaft 12 and rotating the plate cams 10 and 11 in accordance with the rotation of the cam shaft 12 . An on/off control of an exhaust valve or an intake valve corresponding to them is performed. [0017]<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the assembling apparatus of the cam assembly has an apparatus main body 15 having a tower-type construction. The apparatus main body 15 has an assembling base plate 16 on the lower side and has a gear assembling apparatus 17 on the upper side. The gear assembling apparatus 17 has a press (preferably, a hydraulic press) and, also as shown in Fig. 4, a gear<br>
positioning tool 20 is attached through a load cell 19 to a lower edge of a pressing ram 18 which hangs down from the press.<br>
[0018]<br>
The gear positioning tool 20 has a short cylindrical shape and is constructed in a manner such that a disk-shaped positioning concave portion 20a having almost the same diameter as that of the gear 13 is formed in the center portion of the lower surface, and a shaft relief hole 20b is formed at the center of the positioning concave portion 20a. A seating surface 20c matched with a plate surface of the gear 13 is formed on the upper surface of the positioning concave portion 20a in Fig. 4. Although not shown, a positioning tooth portion with which a tooth portion of the gear 13 is come into engagement is formed in a part of an inner peripheral wall. An air passage 21 is formed in the positioning concave portion 20a. A vacuum device (not shown) such as a vacuum pump is connected to the air passage 21 through a coupling member (not shown).<br>
[0019]<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, a horizontal guide board 23 is fixed on the upper side of the assembling base plate 16. A positioning base plate 26 is come into engagement with a guide rail provided on the horizontal guide board 23 and first and second cam positioning tools 24 and 25 are mounted on the positioning base plate 26, thereby constructing a cam positioning apparatus A of the invention. In the<br>
example shown in the diagram, according to the cam positioning apparatus A, a shaft holder 27 is arranged in parallel with the cam positioning tools 24 and 25 and fixed onto the same positioning base plate 26. [0020]<br>
The shaft holder 27 is shaft positioning means for allowing the cam shaft 12 to stand in the vertical direction at the center and holding it. The horizontal guide board 23 has a driving motor 28 at an edge and is constructed in a manner such that the positioning base plate 26 is reciprocated to right and left in the diagram by the driving motor 28 and the cam positioning tools 24 and 25 and the shaft holder 27 are properly and selectively positioned at predetermined positions just under the gear positioning tool 20. [0021]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, each of the cam positioning tools 24 and 25 has a short cylindrical attaching base plate 29 having an annular flange portion 29a in the lower portion. A disk-shaped positioning template 30 is attached onto the attaching base plate 29. A circular concave portion 30a is formed in a center portion on the upper surface of the positioning template 30 and, further, a positioning hole 31 which penetrates through the circular concave portion 30a in the plate thickness direction is formed at the center thereof. The positioning hole 31 is formed so as to have almost the same shape as that of each of the plate cams 10<br>
and 11 with the arc-cam-shape in a manner such that a seating surface S with an arc-cam-shape serving as a part of the upper surface of the attaching base plate 29 faces outside. [0022]<br>
A shaft relief hole 29a which penetrates at a penetrating position of the cam shaft 12 under the positioning hole 31 is formed in the attaching base plate 29. An air passage 32 which penetrates at the concave and convex positions of the plate cams 10 and 11 beside the hole 29c is formed. The air passage 32 is constructed in a manner such that an upper edge opening portion at an entrance is formed in a slightly wide cylindrical shape in accordance with the shape of the convex portion 14a of each of the plate cams 10 and 11 as shown in Fig. 2, and a positioning engagement concave portion 29b is formed there. [0023]<br>
In the cam positioning apparatus A, as shown in Fig. 1, the cam positioning tools 24 and 25 are fixed onto the positioning base plate 26 at attaching positions where the positioning holes 31 are arranged at relative positions which are deviated by a predetermined angle a in accordance with the phase difference of the plate cams 10 and 11. [0024]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 2, the cam positioning tools 24 and 25 are constructed in a manner such that a lower edge opening of the air passage 32 is connected to a vacuum device P such as a vacuum pump through a coupling member<br>
(not shown), thereby enabling spaces between the positioning templates 30 and the plate cams 10 and 11 to be vacuum-sucked through the air passages 32. Each cam positioning tool has a vacuum degree detecting apparatus T such as a vacuum gauge, thereby enabling vacuum degrees in the spaces between the positioning templates 30 and the plate cams 10 and 11 to be detected when they are vacuum-sucked, respectively.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the case of assembling the cam assembly C by using the foregoing assembling apparatus, as shown in Fig. 4, the gear 13 is fitted and set into the positioning concave portion 20a. When the setting of the gear 13 is detected by, for example, a proper sensor (not shown), the vacuum device of the gear assembling apparatus 17 is made operative and air in a space between the positioning concave portion 20a and the gear 13 is sucked through the air passage 21. The gear 13 is adsorbed onto the seating surface 20c by a vacuum pressure of this moment and held lest it is dropped.<br>
[0026]<br>
When the gear 13 is vacuum-sucked as mentioned above, the vacuum degree in this space is detected by, for example, a vacuum degree detecting apparatus (not shown) and an adhesion degree of the gear 13 of the positioning concave portion 20a to the seating surface 20c is checked from the detected vacuum degree. In this case, when a predetermined vacuum degree is obtained, the gear 13 is held<br>
as it is in the positioning concave portion 20a. When the predetermined vacuum degree is not obtained, the gear 13 is set to a predetermined position again by correcting an inclination or the like.<br>
[0027]<br>
The cam shaft 12 is allowed to stand vertically by the shaft holder 27, positioned, and set. The plate cams 10 and 11 are positioned and held by the first and second cam positioning devices 24 and 25, respectively.<br>
[0028]<br>
When the first plate cam 10 is positioned and held, as shown in Fig. 2, in a state where the convex portion 14a faces downward, the first plate cam 10 is inserted into the first positioning hole 31 of the positioning template 30 and the convex portion 14a is come into engagement with the positioning engagement concave portion 29b, put onto the seating surface S, and set.<br>
[0029]<br>
Subsequently, when the setting of the first plate cam 10 is detected by, for example, a proper sensor (not shown), the vacuum device P is made operative, thereby sucking air in the space between the positioning template 30 and first plate cam 10 through the air passage 32. The plate cam 10 is adsorbed onto the seating surface S by a vacuum pressure of this moment and held. When the plate cam 10 is vacuum-sucked as mentioned above, a vacuum degree in the space between the positioning template 30 and first<br>
plate cam 10 is detected by the vacuum degree detecting apparatus T. An adhesion degree of the plate cam 10 to the seating surface S of the positioning template 30 is checked from the detected vacuum degree. In this case, if a predetermined vacuum degree is obtained, the plate cam 10 is held as it is in the positioning hole 31. If the predetermined vacuum degree is not obtained, the plate cam 10 is set again to a predetermined position by correcting the inclination or the like of the plate cam 10. In the invention, for example, the adhesion degree of the plate cam or the like to the seating surface of the positioning template can be also checked by a construction such that the compressed air is fed into spaces between the plate cam, the gear, and the positioning template and these spaces are set into a negative pressure state. [0030]<br>
Also in the case of positioning and holding the second plate cam 11, similarly, the plate cam 11 is inserted into the positioning hole 31 of the second cam positioning tool 25, put onto the seating surface S, and vacuum-sucked by the vacuum device P. An adhesion degree of the plate cam 11 to the seating surface S of the positioning template 30 is checked from the detected vacuum degree and, thereafter, the plate cam 11 is set. In the cam positioning apparatus A according to the invention, consequently, the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are positioned and held at relative positions where their attaching phases are<br>
deviated in the circumferential direction of the angle a as shown in Fig. 1 in accordance with the predetermined phase difference on the cam shaft 12.<br>
[0031]<br>
After the gear 13, cam shaft 12, and plate cams 10 and 11 are positioned and held, respectively, the driving motor 28 is made operative to thereby move the positioning base plate 26. First, the shaft holder 27 is guided to an assembling position just under the gear positioning tool 20. The cam shaft 12 is matched with the center of the shaft relief hole 20b of the gear 13.<br>
[0032]<br>
Subsequently, the hydraulic press of the gear assembling apparatus 17 is made operative, thereby allowing the pressing ram 18 to descend from a standby position shown in Fig. 7 by a predetermined distance. As shown in Fig. 4, the cam shaft 12 is inserted into a shaft through-hole 13a of the gear 13 by pressure, thereby assembling the gear 13 to a predetermined length position on the cam shaft 12.<br>
[0033]<br>
After that, the pressing ram 18 is returned to the standby position and the positioning base plate 26 is moved again. The first cam positioning tool 24 is guided to an assembling position just under the gear positioning tool 20. The cam shaft 12 is matched with the center of the shaft through-hole 22 of the first plate cam 10.<br>
[0034]<br>
The pressing ram 18 is allowed to descend again by a predetermined distance. The cam shaft 12 is inserted into the shaft through-hole 22 of the first plate cam 10 by pressure, thereby assembling the plate cam 10 to a predetermined length position on the cam shaft 12. Also with respect to the second plate cam 11, in a manner similar to the above, the cam shaft 12 is inserted at the assembling position just under the gear positioning tool 20 by pressure. Thus, at a predetermined length position on the cam shaft 12, the second plate cam is assembled to a predetermined angle position which is deviated in the circumferential direction by the angle a from the first plate cam 10.<br>
[0035]<br>
Although each of the plate cams 10 and 11 mentioned above is the cam having the convex portion 14a and the concave portion 14b on both plate surfaces, the example shown in the drawings also incorporates a case of using flat plate cams without such concave and convex portions on the plate surfaces.<br>
[0036]<br>
The example in which the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are positioned by using the first and second cam positioning device 24 and 25 while shifting the attaching phases in the circumferential direction of the cam shaft 12 by the predetermined angle a has been shown above. However, according to the invention, in the cam assembly C. by constructing the first and second plate cams<br>
10 and 11 as follows, they can be also positioned to relative positions which are away by the predetermined phase<br>
difference a. [0037]<br>
In the embodiment shown in the diagrams, a construction of the second plate cam 11 will be first described. The plate cam 11 is punched and formed by using, for example, the fine blanking method. In a manner similar to that of the cam shown in Fig. 5, the cam 11 is formed in an arc-cam-shape having the extending portion 14 which extends outwardly in one direction from the shaft through-hole 22. The convex portionl 14a is formed on one plate surface and the concave portion 14b is formed on the other plate surface at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion 14a. [0038]<br>
Although the first plate cam 10 is punched and formed in a manner similar to the second plate cam 11, for example, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the cam 10 comprises: an arc-cam-shaped cam main body portion 10a in which the shaft through-hole 22 is formed; and a similar plate-shaped coupling projecting portion 10b which laterally extends from the shaft through-hole 22. [0039]<br>
The coupling projecting portion 10b is formed in a manner such that a length of projecting portion is slightly shorter than that of the second plate cam 11 and<br>
an outer edge is formed in a round shape in accordance with the outer shape of the extending portion 14. Moreover, at a position which is away from the attaching phase of the first plate cam 10 by an angle corresponding to the phase difference (angle a) between the first and second plate cams<br>
10	and 11, a convex portion 10c is formed on one of plate<br>
surfaces of the coupling projecting portion 10b and a<br>
concave portion lOd is formed on the other plate surface<br>
at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex<br>
portion 10c.<br>
[0040]<br>
The first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are laminated by the coupling projecting portion 10b, coupled by fitting the concave portion lOd and convex portion 14a, and integrated. Thus, both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are restricted by the fitting of the concave portion lOd and convex portion 14a and positioned at predetermined attaching phases which are away by the angle corresponding to the phase difference a.<br>
[0041]<br>
Therefore, in the example shown in the diagrams, upon assembling of the cam assembly C, although not shown, for example, after the cam shaft 12 was inserted by pressure and the gear 13 was assembled, the integrated cams 10 and<br>
11	with the above construction are positioned and held by<br>
using the proper positioning tools and the cam shaft 12 is<br>
inserted into the shaft through-hole 22 by pressure. Thus,<br>
the plate cams 10 and 11 are assembled onto the cam shaft 12 at the predetermined relative positions where the attaching phases are deviated by the predetermined angle<br>
a.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the example shown in the diagrams, a deformed cam shape such that the coupling projecting portion 10b is formed on the side of the first plate cam 10 and the concave portion lOd and convex portion 10c are formed there is constructed with respect to the second plate cam 10. In the invention, however, a similar deformed cam shape can be also formed on the side of the second plate cam 11 with respect to the first plate cam 10. [0043]<br>
According to the invention, by constructing the cam assembly C as follows, the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 can be also positioned at the attaching phases<br>
which are away by the predetermined phase difference a. [0044]<br>
In the embodiment shown in the diagrams, in the cam assembly C, the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are similarly punched and formed by using the fine blanking method in the same arc-cam-shape as that shown in Fig. 5. The convex portion 14a is formed on one of the plate surfaces and the concave portion 14b is formed on the other plate surface at the position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion 14a. Further, a coupling plate 35 is<br>
arranged between the plate cams 10 and 11 as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 and both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are integratedly coupled by the coupling plate 35.<br>
[0045]<br>
The coupling plate 35 is similarly punched and formed by using the fine blanking method. The same shaft through-holes 22 as those of the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 are formed in the coupling plate 35. Plate portions 36 and 37 which are branched from the shaft through-hole 22 and extend outwardly are provided for the coupling plate 35.<br>
[0046]<br>
The plate portions 36 and 37 are constructed in a manner such that lengths of projecting portions are slightly shorter than the first and second plate cams 10 and 11 and outer edges are formed in a round shape in accordance with the outer shape of the extending portion 14. Further, the plate portions 36 and 37 are formed with, for example, a convex portion 36a and a hole-shaped concave portion 37a at relative positions which are away by an angle corresponding to the phase difference a between both of the plate cams 10 and 11. A concave portion 36b is formed on the other plate surface at a position corresponding to the back side of the convex portion 36a.<br>
[0047]<br>
According to the coupling plate 35 with the above construction, in the plate portion 36, the first plate cam<br>
10 is laminated by fitting the convex portion 36a and concave portion 14b, in the other plate portion 37, the second plate cam 11 is laminated by fitting the concave portion 37a and convex portion 14a, and both of the plate cams 10 and 11 are coupled by the coupling plate 35 and integrated. Thus, both plate cams 10 and 11 are restricted by the fitting of the concave and convex portions by the coupling plate 35 and positioned at the predetermined attaching phases which are deviated by the angle corresponding to the phase difference a.<br>
[0048]<br>
Therefore, in the example shown in the diagrams, upon assembling of the cam assembly C, in a manner similar to that mentioned above, after the cam shaft 12 was inserted by pressure and the gear 13 was assembled, by inserting the cam shaft 12 into the shaft through-hole 22 by pressure, the integrated cams 10 and 11 with the above construction are assembled onto the cam shaft 12 at the predetermined relative positions where the attaching phases are deviated by the predetermined angle a.<br>
[0049]<br>
Although each of the concave and convex portions 14b and 14a and the like has the cylindrical shape, they can be also formed in another proper shape such as a prism shape or the like.<br>
[0050]<br>
Although the example of assembling the cam<br>
assembly C which is used in the internal combustion engine for the motorcycle or the like has been shown above, the invention can be naturally and widely applied to a case of assembling a cam assembly which is used in a field other than the internal combustion engine. Although the example of using two plate cams has been shown here, the invention can be also applied to a case of using three or more plate cams.<br>
[0051] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention constructed as mentioned above, the following effects are obtained.<br>
[0052]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 1, the positioning holes are arranged at the relative positions whose directions are deviated by the predetermined angle in accordance with the phase difference between the first and second plate cams. The first and second positioning tools are fixed onto the positioning base plate. Upon assembling of the cam assembly, both of the plate cams are fitted into the positioning holes, respectively, and the cam shaft is inserted into the shaft through-hole by pressure. Thus, the first and second plate cams can be positioned and held onto the cam shaft with the predetermined phase difference without a deviation. Thus, assembling precision of both of the plate cams to the cam shaft can be remarkably improved. Therefore, when the cam<br>
operates, a situation such that the abutting states of the cam surfaces to the follower such as a valve or the like become uneven or the contact positions are deviated can be eliminated. Operational precision can be improved. A durability of the cams can be improved.<br>
[0053]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 2, when the first and second plate cams are positioned and held, they are fitted into the positioning holes of the positioning tools and put onto the seating surfaces of the positioning holes, respectively. The space between the plate cam and the positioning tool is vacuum-sucked in the positioning hole. The adhesion degree of the plate cam to the seating surface is checked from the vacuum degree which is obtained at this time. Thus, the occurrence of the positional deviation such as inclination of the plate cam or the like can be prevented and the plate cam can be more certainly positioned.<br>
[0054]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 3, when the first and second plate cams are coupled by fitting the concave and convex portions thereof, those plate cams are previously positioned at the relative positions which are away by the angle in accordance with the predetermined phase difference and integrated. Therefore, when the cam shaft is inserted into the shaft through-hole and the cam assembly is assembled, those plate cams can be positioned<br>
and held onto the cam shaft with the predetermined phase difference without a deviation, so that the assembling precision of the plate cams to the cam shaft can be fairly improved. Consequently, in a manner similar to that mentioned above, when the cam operates, a situation such that the abutting states of the cam surfaces to the follower such as a valve or the like become uneven or the contact positions are deviated can be eliminated. Operational precision can be improved. A durability of the cams can be improved. [0055]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 4, when the first plate cam is laminated by fitting the convex and concave portions on one side of the coupling plate, the second plate cam is laminated by fitting the concave and convex portions on the other side, and they are coupled, the first and second plate cams are previously positioned at the predetermined relative positions which are away by the angle in accordance with the predetermined phase difference and integrated. Therefore, when the cam shaft is inserted into the shaft through-hole by pressure and the cam assembly is assembled, those plate cams can be positioned and held onto the cam shaft with the predetermined phase difference without a deviation, so that the assembling precision of the plate cams to the cam shaft can be fairly improved. Consequently, in a manner similar to that mentioned above, when the cam operates, a situation<br>
such that the abutting states of the cam surfaces to the follower such as a valve or the like become uneven or the contact positions are deviated can be eliminated. Operational precision can be improved. A durability of the cams can be improved. [Brief Description of Drawings]<br>
