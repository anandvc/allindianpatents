				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention generally relates to data communication systems. More particularly, the invention involves a method and an apparatus for supporting intercom and conferencing between corded and cordless telephone handsets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
Private Branch Exchange (PBX) devices are used to expand the number of telephone handsets or sets which share a common Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) line or a set POTS lines from a business or residence to a telephone company Central Office (CO) switch. PBX devices support features such as set-to-set intercom and set-to-CO conferencing.<br>
Conventional analog techniques for generating local signals for intercom or summed signals for intercom require analog mulktiplexers and summing amplifiers. In contrast, digital techniques usually require high speed Digital Signal Processors (DSP). As such there is -difficulty in combining analog and digital techniques for generating intercom and conferencing signals.<br>
International application WO 96/04744 proposes a communication system for conducting a conference call between multiple wired or wireless handset users and a remote conferee conununicating over a telephone line. Each of the incoming compressed signals from the handset users are decompressed and attenuated, prior to being added together. The summed signals are then put through a digital-to-analog converter and sent to the remote conferee on the telephone line. The summed signals are also added to the output resulting from the operation of an analog-to-digital converter on the incoming signal from the remote conferee, and the entire summed signal is compressed and sent out to each of the handset users. International application WO 97/36397 proposes providing a multi-party speech connection for use in a wireless communication system. The apparatus comprises a first speech encoder producing a first encoded speech signal, a second speech encoder producing a second encoded speech signal, a conference circuit, and a speech decoder responsive to the conference circuit. The conference circuit receives the first and second speech encoded signals and produces a multiplexed encoded speech signal. The speech<br><br>
2<br>
decoder receives the multiplexed encoded speech signal and produces a decoded speech signal.<br>
Therefore, in a multi-handset hybrid telephone system supporting both analog and digital cordless telephone applications, the task of supporting intercom and conferencing features between corded and cordless is problematic, A need exists in the art to support intercom and conferencing features between analog corded telephones and digital cordless telephones.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is provided apparatus for supporting intercom and conferencing between corded telephone handsets, cordless telephone handsets and a network line, the apparatus comprising a network interface (coupled to each network line, for converting a signal from the network line into a digital network signal, an analog converter coupled to each corded telephone handset, for digitizing a signal from the corded telephone handset into a digital corded handset signal;<br>
a digital converter, coupled to the cordless telephone handsets, for converting a signal from the cordless telephone handsets into a digital cordless handset signal, and a signal processing circuit, coupled to said network interface, said analog converter and said digital converter, for generating a set of output signals, the digital corded handset signal and the digital cordless handset signal, characterized in that said signal processing circuit generates a set of output signals from the digital network signal which is a composite of the signals from all.the handsets except the handset to which the signal is sent to.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for performing telephone conferencing and intercom for corded and cordless telephone handsets, comprising the steps of;: producing first, second and third signals respectively from a telecommunications network, a cordless telephone handset and a corded handset, combining first and second signals to from a first composite signal, combining said first and third signals to form a second composite signal, combining said second and third signals to form a third composite signal, coupling said first composite signal to said corded telephone handset, coupling said second composite signal to said cordless handset, and coupling said third composite signal to said telecommunications network.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 shows a high level block diagram of a telephone system that integrates corded and cordless telephone sets with POTS network lines, and<br>
FIG. 2 shows a high level block diagram of a telephone system that integrates corded and cordless telephone handsets with a digital telephone system.<br>
To facilitate understanding of the invention, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 shows a high level block diagram of a telephone system 100 that integrates corded and cordless telephone handsets with pots lines. As with a conventional private branch exchange (PBX) system, the telephone system coordinates telephone handsets to POTS lines that are connected to a telephone company central office (GO) switch. However, the telephone system 100 in accordance with the present invention supports intercom between corded and cordless telephone handsets, and conferencing between corded telephone<br><br>
4 <br>
handsets, cordless telephone handsets and telephone lines that link other<br>
telephone handsets.<br>
Specifically, the telephone system 100 includes a coder-decoder or codec 102A, 102B and 102C for each telephone line and for each corded telephone handset, a Subscriber Line Interface Circuit (SLIC) 104C for each corded telephone handset, a Time-Division-Multiplexed (TDM) bus 106, a control port 108, a TDM controller 110, a Multiply and Accumulate Circuit (MAC) 112, a radio-frequency (RF) transmitter-receiver or transceiver (XCVR) 114 for the cordless telephone handsets and a baseband processor 116 for the cordless telephone handsets.<br>
In operation, each of the codecs 102A or 102B samples data, tyrpically an audio signal, entering the telephone system 100 from the respective analog POTS network lines via respective signal lines A and B and encodes the sampled data to digitize the analog data signal. On a system level, the codecs 102A and 102B operate as a network interface, coupled to the analog network lines via signal lines A and B, for converting or digitizing the incoming signals into digital network signals. As such, the codecs 102A and 102B operate as analog to digital converters for data entering the telephone system 100 and as digital to analog converters for data leaving the telephone system 100.<br>
The codecs 102A and 102B couple the MAC 112 via the TDM bus 106 and couple the TDM controller 110 via the control port 108. After digitizing the analog signals from the POTS lines, each of the codecs 102A or 102B writes or drives the respective digitized signals to the TDM bus 106 during a time slot as determined by the TDM controller 110. Each of the codecs 102A or 102B reads output data from the TDM bus 106 during the time slot set by the TDM controller 110.<br>
In addition to processing signals from the analog POTS network lines, the telephone system 100 processes signals from the corded and cordless telephone handsets. The SLIC module 104C processes signals from the corded telephone handset via signal line C. The SLIC module 104C couples the codec 102C via signal path S1.<br><br>
5<br>
 The codec 102C for the corded telephone handset operates in substantially<br>
the same manner as codecs 102A and 102B for the POTS lines. The codec 102C<br>
samples and encodes the signal from path SI to produce a digitized signal for the<br>
corded telephone handset. Each paired SLIC module 104C and codec 102C, as<br>
coupled to the corded telephone handset via signal path C, operates as an analog to digital converter for digitizing the signal from the cordless handset into a digital corded<br>
handset signal.<br>
The codec 102C couples the MAC 112 via the TDM bus 106 and couples the TDM controller 110 via the control port 108. As such, the codec 102C writes to or reads from the TDM bus 106 during time frames as determined by the TDM controller 110.<br>
The RF XCVR or radio frequency transceiver 114 demodulates the radio frequency signals, from the cordless telephone handsets via signal paths D and E, into baseband signals. The RF XCVR 114 couples the baseband processor 116 via signal path S2. The baseband processor 116 decodes the baseband signal into a digital cordless handset signal of a particular cordless telephone handset. As such, the RF XCVR 114 and baseband processor 116 is an analog to digital converter, coupled to the cordless handsets via signal paths D and E, for converting the signal from the cordless handsets into a digital cordless handset signal. This signal is provided to the TDM bus 106 during a time slot determined by the TDM controller 110.<br>
The baseband processor 116 may support multiple cordless telephone handsets illustratively shown via lines D and E. As the telephone system 100 digitizes audio signals from both corded and cordless telephone handsets in the same digitized format on the TDM bus 106. the TDM controller 110 and the MAC 112 views the baseband processor 116 as multiple codecs, each with an unique time slot. The required number of time slots for the TDM bus 106 equals the total number of telephone handset and external lines. As such, five time slots are required in the example shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As the codecs 102A, 102B and 102C and the baseband processor 116 couple the TDM controller 110 via the TDM bus 106. the TDM controller 110 sends control signals for enabling the codecs 102A, 102B and 102C, and the baseband<br><br>
6 <br>
processor 116 to write or read from the TDM bus 106 during scheduled time slots.<br>
The TDM controller 110 couples the MAC 112 via the control port 108. The TDM<br>
controller 110 also sets up a desired matrix in the MAC 112 at the beginning of<br>
the call and cancels this matrix at the end of the call.<br>
The MAC or multiply and accumulate circuit or signal processing circuit 112 generally reads data from different time slots, forms balanced summed signals from the input data and writes output signals onto the TDM bus 106 during a time slot determined by the TDM controller 110. More specifically, the MAC 112 reads the input values during the appropriate time slots in a TDM frame, multiplies each input value by its coefficient, accumulates the products and writes the resulting sum to the TDM bus 106 during the appropriate time slot in the next frame. Each of these specific steps will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
The MAC 112 initially reads the input data values from the TDM bus 106 during appropriate time slots in a TDM frame. These input values arrive as each codec 102A, 102B, or 102C, or the baseband processor 116 writes to the TDM bus 106 during its scheduled time slot as controlled by the TDM controller 110, The TDM bus 106, which couples the MAC 112 with the codecs 102A, 102B and 102C, and the baseband processor 116, includes two data lines which serve as input and output data lines to the MAC 112, As the input values arrive through the input data line, the MAC 112 simultaneously writes data to the codec 102A, 102B or 102C, or the baseband processor 116 through the output line of the TDM bus 106. The number of required time slots is usually equal to the number of corded and cordless telephone handsets plus the number of POTS lines. In this small system example shown in FIG. 1, the MAC 112 requires five time slots.<br>
The MAC 112 multiplies each input value by its coefficient and accumulates the products after each succeeding time slot. The coefficients, typically expressed in matrix format for a plurality of telephone lines and telephone handsets, are provided as the TDM controller 110 sets up the desired coefficient matrix at the beginning of the telephone conference or intercom. The coefficient matrix values depend on the corded and cordless handsets that are connected during the conference. These coefficient matrix values may change<br><br>
7<br>
 when other corded and cordless handsets join and/or exit the conference or<br>
intercom. As the MAC 112 interacts with the TDM controller 110 only during<br>
matrix setup and cancellation, the configuration may significantly reduce digital<br>
signaling requirements for the telephone system 100. The MAC 112 may<br>
comprise a special-purpose sequential circuit to perform the multiply and<br>
accumulate functions and to ensure quick operation of the telephone system 100.<br>
As an illustrative example, the telephone system 100 may involve a<br>
conferencing application such that POTS lines A and B are linked with telephone<br>
handset C. Let Ai represent input to the system firom line A, Ao represent output<br>
to line A, and ka represent the multiplying coefficient. Input, output and<br>
multiplying coefficients are similarly represented for POTS line B and telephone<br>
handset C as Bi, Bo, kb, Ci, Co and kc. The MAC determines the resulting sums:<br>
Ao - kbBi + kcCi	Bo = koAi + kcCi	Co = koAi + kbBi<br>
using the multiply and accumulate procedure discussed above.<br>
After reading the input data, multiplying the inputs by its coefficient and accumulating the products, the MAC 112 writes the resulting output to the output lines of the TDM bus 106 as determined by the TDM controller 110. This output is usually delayed one frame time from the input as a particular input signal component may have arrived later in the previous frame. The delay is not perceptible as the frame time is normally about 125usec. However, the MAC 112 may also include echo cancellation digital filters to introduce a greater process delay.<br>
The codecs 102A, 102B and 102C, and the baseband processor 116 read the output values of the MAC 112 firom the TDM bus 106 as determined by the TDM controller 110. The codecs 102A, 102B and 102C then convert these outputs into analog signals for the respective POTS lines and corded telephone handsets.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a high level block diagram of a telephone system 200 that integrates corded and cordless telephone handsets with a digital telephone system. The telephone system 200 is similar to the telephone system 100 shown<br><br>
8 <br>
in FIG. 1 except for the signal processing used for coupling signals from and to<br>
the digital telephone system or digital network.<br>
The codec 206, SLIC 208, RF XCVR 210, baseband processor 212, TDM bus 214, control port 216 and MAC 218 operate in substantially the same manner as the respective codec 102C, SLIC 104C, RF XCVR 114, baseband processor 116, TDM bus 106, control port 108 and MAC 112 of the previous telephone system 100, As such, no further discussion is provided for these components.<br>
Specifically, the telephone system 200 includes a network interface 202, a digital signal processor (DSP) module 204, a codec 206 for each corded telephone handset, a SLIC 208 for each corded telephone handset, a RF receiver 210 for the cordless telephone handsets, a baseband processor 212 for the cordless telephone handsets, a TDM bus 214, a control port 216 and a MAC 218.<br>
The network interface 202 processes digital speech from the digital network. The network interface 202, which typically comprises physical layer and medium access layer components, may include a digital cable modem or a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem for decoding the speech from the digital network. The network interface 202 may also include a compressor/decompressor module for decompressing incoming compressed speech or compressing speech to the digital network in order to better utilize bandwidth. The network interface 202 couples the DSP module 204 via a signal path S3.<br>
The DSP module 204 provides the control functions of the telephone system 200 in a similar manner to the TDM controller in the previous telephone system 100, Additionally, the DSP module 204 may provide speech compression, silence suppression and packetization. A lower-powered DSP module 204 is possible as the MAC 218 may perform sum and multiply functions for the DSP 204.<br>
