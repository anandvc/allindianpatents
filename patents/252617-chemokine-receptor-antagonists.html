The compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt form exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g.as CCR2 and CCR5 antagonists as indicated in in vitro tests as described below.<br>
a) CCR2 membrane binding assay<br>
The SPA (Scintillation Proximity Assay) technology is used to show that the test compounds prevent MCP-1 from binding to cell membranes expressing the CCR2 receptor Transfected CHO-dukX cells stably expressing the hCCR2b gene are grown in MEM alpha medium to a confluency of between 70 and 80 %, After discarding the medium, 30 ml ice-cold physiological buffer solution containing 1 mM EDTA are added and the cells removed from the plate using a scraper. The cell suspension is centrifuged at 800 g for 10' at 4 °C and the cell pellet resuspended in buffer. Cell lysis is done using a Polytron PTI300D instrument at<br><br>
28 000 RPM for 2 times 30 seconds on ice. Membranes are collected by centrifugation at 42 000 g for 20 minutes at 4 °C and subjected to a second round of lysis (Polytron, 28 000 RPM, 2x30 seconds on ice). Following centrifugation at 42 000 g for 20 minutes at 4 °C the membranes are resuspended in buffer at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Ten millimolar stock solutions of test compounds in 100% DMSO are prepared. Test compounds are further diluted in buffer to yield the four-fold concentrated solutions for the tests that assayed a range of 10"10 to 10"5 M. The SPA assay is performed in a final volume of 200 pi per well in 96 well plates. The components are added per well in the following order:<br>
50 pi         Buffer (+/- test compound)<br>
50 |j|         Wheat germ aggiutinin-SPA beads (1.25 mg/well) in buffer<br>
50 pi         CCR2B membrane suspension diluted with buffer to 0.04 mg/ml (2 pg/well),<br>
alternatively 50'000 cells per well 50 pi         [125I] MCP-1 in buffer (60 pM final concentration, 2.5 pCi/plate)<br>
After addition of all components the plate is sealed and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with constant shaking. Following incubation the plate is centrifuged at 1000 RPM in a Sorvall RC3B centrifuge for 4 minutes at room temperature and counted for 3 minutes per well in a TOP COUNT instrument (Packard). The quench-corrected counts are used for the analysis of radioligand binding. Compounds of formula I have an IC50 between 0.0003 and 10 pM.<br>
In a similar manner, binding assays for the rat, mouse and rhesus monkey CCR2 receptors have been established. Due to the species specificity of the CCR2 antagonists, the compounds of formula I have an IC5o between 0.015 and 10 pM on mouse CCR2 and between 0.020 and 10 pM on rat CCR2.<br>
b) CCR2 functional assay - Ca2+ mobilization<br>
hCCR2b-CHO#84 cells:<br>
CHOdukX cell line stably expressing the hCCR2 gene is grown in MEMa up to a confluence<br>
of 80%. The day before the experiment, cells are harvested from the tissue culture flask by<br>
trypsinization, washed, plated in a black/clear bottom 96-weII plate at 5x104 cells per well<br>
and cultured overnight at 37°C in a humid atmosphere enriched with 5% CO2. On the next<br><br>
day, cells are washed twice and loaded for 1 hour at RT in the dark with 2 pM Fluo-4 in buffer C. After two further washes, the cells are resuspended in buffer D. Serial dilutions of the compounds, in buffer D, are mixed with the cells and incubated for half an hour at RT in the dark. Cells are then stimulated by the injection of MCP-1 and calcium fluxes are monitored using the Flexstation™, a benchtop scanning fluorometer with and integrated fluid transfer workstation.<br><br>
hCCR2b-300.19 cells:<br>
Pre-B cell line 300-19 stably expressing the hCCR2 gene (Loetscher et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 276 (5), 2986-91 (2001)) is grown in RPM11640 with glutamax-l supplemented with 1X MEM non essential amino-acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5x10"5 M (3-mercaptoethanoi and 10 % FCS. For the experiment, the cells are used in the exponential growing phase, at a maximal concentration of 1.5x106 cells per ml. Cells are washed in buffer A and loaded at about 2.106 cells per ml in 2 \M fluo-4 in buffer B for 30 min. in the dark, at 37°C in a waterbath. After two washes with buffer A, cells are plated in black/clear bottom 96-well plate at 2x105 cells per well in buffer B. All following steps, including the compound and the chemokine dilutions, are performed as described above for the hCCR2b-CHO#84 cells, except that buffer B is used instead of buffer D.<br>
In this assay, compounds of formula I have an IC5o between 0.0005 and 10 µM. c) CCR2 functional assay - chemotaxis<br>
An in vitro cell migration assay for CCR2-dependent chemotaxis based on Transwell™ membrane inserts is used to profile the compounds. The assay is performed with the human monocyticTHP-1 cell line and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). THP-1 cells are cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS. Activated PBL are prepared from human blood by elutriation and then activated by culture on anti-human CD3-coated culture plates and expanded by subsequent culture in medium supplemented with IL-2. Aliquots of activated PBL are frozen in liquid nitrogen and used in migration experiments<br><br>
after thawing and overnight culture. Cells from cultures at a density of less than 1.2 x 106 cells/ml are counted, washed and resuspended at an appropriate density in RPMI1640 containing 0.5 % BSA. Transwell™ membrane inserts of 6.5 mm diameter, 3 or 8 pm pore size and tissue culture treated polycarbonate membrane are used for the migration assays. The transwell inserts are loaded with cells and compounds in a final volume of 100 µ in RPM11640/0.5 % BSA. For THP-1 cells, 8 pm pore size inserts are used. For PBLs the use of 3 µm pore size inserts resulted in lower non-specific counts. The inserts are placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate containing recombinant human MCP-1 and compounds in a final volume of 600 pi. After allowing the cells to migrate to the bottom compartment, the assay is stopped by removing and discarding the transwell inserts. Cells in the bottom compartment are collected and counted on a FACScan flow cytometer by acquiring all events for 30 s with settings established for each cell type. Migration is expressed as absolute cell counts/30 s relative to the input cell number measured under the same conditions.<br>
In this assay, compounds of formula I have an IC50 between 0.0012 and 10 pM.<br>
d) CCR5 membrane binding assay<br>
Human CCR5 is used to generate stable transfectants in CHO K1 cells. Membranes prepared from these CCR5 transfectants are used in a radioligand binding assay using 125-l-MIP-1a as a ligand and the compounds of formula I are tested for inhibitory activity. The data are reported as IC50, i.e. the concentration of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of [M25]MIP-1a binding. In this assay, compounds of formula I have an IC5o between 0.004 and 10 pM.<br>
The Agents of the invention are effective as dual CCR-2 and CCR-5 antagonists. Thus the Agents of the invention are useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of CCR-2 and CCR-5 mediated diseases or medical conditions. CCR-2 and CCR-5 play an important role in leukocyte trafficking, in particular in monocyte migration to inflammatory sites and thus the agents of the invention may be used to inhibit monocyte migration e.g. in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, allergies and allergic conditions, autoimmune diseases, chronic pain, graft rejection, cancers which involve leukocyte filtration, stenosis or restenosis, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and chronic pain.<br><br>
Diseases or conditions which may be treated with the Agents of the Invention include: Inflammatory or allergic conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, COPD, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), (e.g. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with autoimmune diseases such as RA, SLE, etc.); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e.g. to penicillins or cephalosporins), and insect sting allergies; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulceratiye colitis; spondyloarthropathies, sclerodoma; psoriasis and inflammatory dermatoses such as dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis;<br>

graft rejection (e.g. in transplantation including heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney, pancreatic, skin, or corneal transplants) including allograft rejection or xenograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, and organ transplant associated arteriosclerosis; atherosclerosis; cancer with leukocyte infiltration of the skin or organs; breast cancer;<br><br>
stenosis or restenosis of the vasculature, particularly of the arteries, e.g. the coronary artery, including stenosis or restenosis which results from vascular intervention, as well as neointimal hyperplasia; stroke;<br>
and other diseases or conditions involving inflammatory responses including reperfusion injury, hematologic malignancies, cytokine induced toxicity (e,g, septic shock or endotoxic shock), polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis; infectious diseases, including HIV and AIDS.<br>
The term treatment" as used herein is to be understood as including both therapeutic and prophylactic modes of therapy e.g. in relation to the treatment of neoplasia, therapy to prevent the onset of clinically or preclinically evident neoplasia, or for the prevention of initiation of malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premaiignant to malignant cells, as well as the prevention or inhibition of neoplasia growth or metastasis. In this context, the present invention is, in particular, to be understood as embracing the use of compounds of the present invention to inhibit or prevent development of skin cancer, e.g. squamus or basal cell carcinoma consequential to UV light exposure, e.g. resultant from chronic exposure to the sun.<br>
Agents of the Invention are particularly useful for treating diseases of bone and cartilage metabolism including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, and bone loss in general, including age-related bone loss, and in particular periodontal disease.<br>
The Agents of the Invention may also be used in ocular applications which include the treatment of ocular disorders, in particular of ocular inflammatory disorders, of ocular pain including pain associated with ocular surgery such as PRK or cataract surgery, of ocular allergy, of photophobia of various etiology, of elevated intraocular pressure (in glaucoma) by inhibiting the production of trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response (TIGR) protein, and of dry eye disease.<br>
For the above indications, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the particular Agent of the Invention to be employed, the subject to be treated, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However,<br><br>
in prophylactic use, satisfactory results are generally indicated to be obtained at dosages from about 0.05 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight, more usually from about 0.1 mg to about 5 mg per kilogram body weight. The frequency of dosing for prophylactic use will normally be in the range from about once per week up to about once every 3 months, more usually in the range from about once every 2 weeks up to about once every. 10 weeks, e.g. once every 4 or 8 weeks. Agent of the Invention is conveniently administered parenterally, intravenously, e.g. into the antecubital or other peripheral vein, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. For example, a prophylactic treatment typically comprises administering the Agent of the Invention once per month to once every 2 to 3 months, or less frequently.<br>
The Agents of the invention may be administered in combination with another active agent. Suitable active agents include antimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate), anti-TNF agents (e.g. Remicade® (infliximab), Enbrel® (Etanercept), Humira® (adalumimab)), anti-IL-1 agents (e.g. prainacasan, ACZ885), nucleoside and non-nucleoside revers transcriptase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors and other antiretrovirai agents. The active agent or agents may be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially with the Agent of the invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be manufactured in conventional manner. A composition according to the invention is preferably provided in iyophilized form. For immediate administration it is dissolved in a suitable aqueous carrier, for example sterile water for injection or sterile buffered physiological saline. If it is considered desirable to make up a solution of larger volume for administration by infusion rather as a bolus injection, it is advantageous to incorporate human serum albumin or the patient's own heparinised blood into the saline at the time of formulation.   The presence of an excess of such physiologically inert protein prevents loss of antibody by adsorption onto the walls of the container and tubing used with the infusion solution. If albumin is used, a suitable concentration is from 0.5 to 4.5% by weight of the saline solution.<br>
The Agents of the Invention may be administered by any conventional route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of solutions for drinking, tablets or capsules or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Normally for systemic administration oral dosage forms are preferred, although for some indications the Agents of the Invention may also be administered topically or dermaliy, e.g. in the form of a dermal cream or gel or like<br><br>
preparation or, for the purposes of application to the eye, in the form of an ocular cream, gel or eye-drop preparation; or may be administered by inhalation, e.g., for treating asthma. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise e.g. from 25 to 250mg of Agent • of the Invention per unit dosage.<br><br>
