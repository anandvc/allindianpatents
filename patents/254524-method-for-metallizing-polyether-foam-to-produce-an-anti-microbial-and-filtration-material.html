				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No,<br>
60/603,610, which was filed August 23,2004 and which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.	<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed generally to forming anti-microbial materials, and more<br>
particularly to forming foam materials having anti-microbial activity and/or filtration<br>
properties,<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There are several prior art methods that describe metallizing of foam substrates<br>
(e.g., Patent Nos: 6,395,402; 5,151,222; 3,661,597). Different methods have bee4 used to<br>
metallize foam for various applications such as EMI shielding etc. Patent No: 6,3195,402<br>
discuss the metallization of copper/nickel for EMI applications. While the adhesion of<br>
the metal to the foam may he good, the process cannot produce a good silver coating due<br>
to the difference in deposition rates of copper versus silver. In addition, these materials<br><br>
do not provide any-mierobial activity as copper/nickel do not provide anti-microbial<br>
properties. The other patents listed produce rigid foam that cannot be used in a .<br>
medical anti-microbial applications) or as a flexible filter.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method of metallizing foam that is capable of<br>
using silver .Also what is needed is a method of forming a foam material that has! anti-<br>
microbial activity. Additionally what is needed is a method of forming a foam material<br>
that may be used as a filter and having anti-microbial activity.	<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method of metallizing a foam material. The<br>
method may be used to form a foam material having anti-microbial activity by<br>
metallizing the foam with a metal, such as silver. The resulting foam may be used in a<br>
variety of different applications such as a filter' material. The methods of the present<br>
invention are simpler than prior art methods since the foam materials may be metallized<br>
without the need for an activation/seeding step. The resulting foam may also be designed<br>
such that the product has a low resistance and/or an optimal metal ion release. The<br>
method of the present invention uses one or more of the steps of etching the foam, pre-<br>
metallizing the foam and metallizing the foam with silver. Depending on the selected<br>
properties of the final foam, the method may use some or all of these steps.	<br>
These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in the following description<br>
and examples that are intended to be illustrative only since numerous modifications and<br>
variations therin will be apparent to those skilled in the art As used in the specification<br>
and in the claims, the singular form "a," "an," and "the" may include plural referents<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Also, as used in the specification and in the<br>
claims, the term "comprising" may include the embodiments "consisting of and "consisting essentially of"<br>
The present invention provides a method of metallizing a foam material. The<br>
method may be used to form a foam material having anti-microbial activity by<br>
metallizing the foam with a metal that provides anti-microbial activity to a material. The<br>
resulting foam may be used in a variety of different applications that may benefit from a<br>
material having anti-microbial activity including, but not limited to, the use of the<br>
metallized foam as a filter material. The methods of the present invention are simpler<br>
than prior art methods because the foam materials may be metallized without an<br>
activation/seeding step commonly associated with prior art methods. The resulting<br>
metallized foam materials are formed such that the metal adheres well to the foam. The<br><br>
resulting foam may be designed such that the product has a low resistance and/or an<br>
optimized silver ion release.<br>
The methods of the present invention are designed to metallize foam without the<br>
need for an activator. As such, the methods of the present invention are capable of<br>
metallizing the film through one or more of the steps of etching the foam, pre-metallizing<br>
the foam and/or metallizing the foam with the selected metal Depending on the selected<br>
properties of the final foam, one or more of these steps may be omitted while still<br>
achieving a metallized foam product. As used herein, an "etchant" is a material capable<br>
of etching or removing portions of the foam material to permit better adhesion of the<br>
metal to the foam substrate to be metallized.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the methods of the present invention etch the foam<br>
to increase the surface area of the foam. To etch the foam, the foam substrate is first<br>
quenched using an etchant and then rinsed. The etchant may be, in one embodiment, a<br>
base solution. The type of base solution may be any base solution capable of removing or<br>
etching portions of the foam substrate. The type of base solution that may be used may<br>
vary depending on one or more factors including, but not limited to, the foam substrate to<br>
be etched, the metal to be applied, the degree of etching desired, and/or the final<br>
characteristics of the metallized foam. Examples of base solutions that may be used for<br>
the etchant include, but are not limited to, alkaline hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide,<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide,<br>
francium hydroxide, beryllium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,<br>
strontium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment,<br>
the base solution is sodium hydroxide.<br>
The foam may be etched by immersing the foam substrate in a solution containing<br>
the etchant As used herein, "immersed" is meant to include any method by which a<br>
solution may be contacted with at least a portion of a surface area of a foam substrate<br>
including, but not limited to, dipping, spraying, immersing, quenching, and/or any other<br>
method capable of applying a liquid to at least a portion of a substrate.<br>
In one embodiment, the first step in the process may be performed either<br>
immediately prior to the second step or may be performed as a preparation step with<br>
subsequent steps taking place at a future time. As such, thicker foams and/or extended<br><br>
amounts of foam may be treated in a mass processing step. This would; enable a<br>
manufacturer to quench thick foam {1' thick) and 12 feet or more of length at a time.<br>
Alternatively, flame-treated non-etched foam may be etched in-house using a stronger<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide.<br>
The first etching step may be performed under a range of operating temperatures<br>
and/or dwell or etch times, depending on the type of foam to be etched, the etcnant used,<br>
and/or the selected characteristics of the finished product Various embodiments for the<br>
methods of the present invention are set forth below, although it is to be understood that<br>
other embodiments are also included within the scope of the present invention. For the<br>
percentage of the foam that is etched:<br><br>
For the temperature at which the process is to be operated:<br><br>
For the etch time of the process:<br><br>
The temperature and time of etch may be dependent on the concentration of the<br>
etchant solution.<br>
After the foam has been etched, the foam may be conditioned with a non-ionic<br>
surfactant or other suitable material to enable the surface to be wet out and/or to clean the<br><br>
surface of any debris/dirt. A good rinsing process using de-ionized water with<br>
temperature under 70o C follows may be used with the following embodiments;<br><br>
Some polyether foams may not be etched since the chemistry as described below<br>
is sufficient to activate the surface of the foam material. As a result, for the methods of<br>
the present invention, when a polyether foam is used as the foam substrate, the foams<br>
may be metallized without the need for an activation/seeding step or an etching step for<br>
preparing the foam for metallization.<br>
After the step of etching the foam, then the methods of the present invention may<br>
include a pre-metallization step. The pre-metallization step is utilized to prepare the foam<br>
for the application of the metal and to help facilitate attachment of the metal to the foam<br>
substrate. In one embodiment, the pre-metallization step may be accomplished by<br>
dipping the etched foam in an acid solution. An acid dip, such as with HC1, may then be<br>
used. The acid dip acts as a pre-metallizing step utilizing the acid as the solvent. Other<br>
acids, such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid, may be used for the pre-metallization step. A<br>
rinsing step may then be used upon completion of the pre-metallizing step.<br>
For the dwell times of the pre-metallizing step, various embodiments are set forth<br>
below:<br><br>
For the concentration of the acid in the pre-metallizing step, various embodiments<br>
include:<br><br><br><br>
For the concentration of the stannous chloride, various embodiments are set forth below:<br>
The pre-inetailization step may, in one embodiment, provide a mixture of stannous<br>
chloride and muriatic acid. The amount of stannous chloride may be, in one embodiment,<br>
selected to be between about 60 gm/1 up to about 140 gm/1 and the concentration of the<br>
muriatic acid may be between about 6 to about 15%. The dwell time may be selected to<br>
be between about 3 and 15 minutes. Once the pre-metallization step is completed, the<br>
process may be followed by a special counter flow rinsing with controlled water flow.<br>
This step enables the acid to remove any excess salts and acids from the substrates yet<br>
leave an optimum amount of activators on the surface. For the concentration of the<br>
muriatic acid, various embodiments are set forth below:<br><br><br>
For the dwell time, various embodiments for the present invention may include:<br><br>
It is to be understood that embodiments for the concentration of the acid, the<br>
concentration of the stannous chloride and/or the dwell time are not required to be used in<br>
the order listed above in the respective tables, but may be used in any order or<br>
combination thereof Accordingly, in one embodiment, the concentration of the acid<br>
may be from about 5 to about 20%, the concentration of the stannous chloride may be<br>
about 10%, and the dwell time may be from about 5 to about 60 minutes. Alternatively,<br>
in another embodiment, the concentration of the acid may be from about 8 to about 18%,<br>
the concentration of the stannous chloride may be from about 5 to about 40%, and the<br>
dwell time may be from about 10 to about 50 minutes.<br>
Once the foam has been prepared, the methods of the present invention then<br>
include a final step of applying the metal to the foam. The step may be referred to as a<br>
metallization step. The metallization step may be performed using blown metallization<br>
technologies such as those described in patent number 3,877,965 or Patent Application<br>
No. 10/666.568, which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The metallized foam may then be placed in an oven at 60-70' C for about 30<br>
minutes to produce a semi-quenching effect to help attach the metal to the foam.<br>
The methods of the present invention may be used with a variety of different<br>
metals that may be desired to be attached to a foam substrate. In one embodiment, the<br>
metal is silver. Silver provides anti-microbial, conductive and/or anti-static properties to<br>
the foam substrate. In. alternative embodiments, the metal may be selected from copper,<br>
gold, aluminum, or any other metal capable of being attached to a foam substrate.<br><br>
The present invention may be used with any type of foam. Examples of foams<br>
that may be used include, but are not limited to, poiyurethane, polyester, polyether, or a<br>
combination thereof. The resulting foams have enhanced resistance (ohms/square), anti-<br>
microbial activity, ion release, or a combination thereof, as compared to prior art foams.<br>
The metallized foam products made according to the methods of the present<br>
invention may be used in any application wherein the advantages offered by the metal<br>
may be utilized. For example, due to the anti-microbial benefits, if the metal is silver, the<br>
metallized foam may be used as a filter material for the filtration of liquids. In addition,<br>
the foam may be in the form of a thin layer, such that the resulting metallized foam may<br>
be used as a wrap for wounds to assist in healing of the wounds.<br>
The present invention will now be further described through examples. It is to be<br>
understood that these examples are non-limiting and are presented to provide a better<br>
understanding of various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
