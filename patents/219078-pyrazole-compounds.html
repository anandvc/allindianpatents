Provisional Patent Application 60/257,887 filed December<br>
21, 2000 and US Provisional Patent Application 60/286,949<br>
filed April 27, 2001, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of<br>
medicinal chemistry and relates to compounds that are<br>
protein kinase inhibitors, compositions containing such<br>
compounds and methods of use. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of<br>
Aurora-2 protein kinase. The invention also relates to<br>
methods of treating diseases associated with protein<br>
kinases especially diseases associated with Aurora-2,<br>
such as cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been<br>
greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of<br>
the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules<br>
associated with target diseases. One important class of<br>
enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is<br>
the protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases mediate intracellular signal<br>
transduction. They do this by effecting a phosphoryl<br>
transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein<br>
acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. There<br>
are a number of kinases and pathways through which<br>
extracellular and other stimuli cause a variety of<br>
cellular responses to occur inside the cell. Examples of<br>
such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress<br>
signals (e.g. osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, bacterial endotoxin, H2O2) , cytokines (e.g.<br>
interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-<br>
a)), and growth factors (e.g. granulocyte macrophage-<br>
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth<br>
factor (FGF). An extracellular stimulus may effect one<br>
or more cellular responses related to cell growth,<br>
migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones,<br>
activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction,<br>
glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis and<br>
regulation of cell cycle.<br>
Many diseases are associated with abnormal<br>
cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated<br>
events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases,<br>
inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative<br>
diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and<br>
asthma, Alzheimer"s disease or hormone-related diseases.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in<br>
medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors<br>
that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
Aurora-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that has been implicated in human cancer, such as colon,<br>
breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is believed<br>
to be involved in protein phosphorylation events that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 may play<br>
a role in controlling the accurate segregation of<br>
chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell<br>
cycle can lead to cellular proliferation and other<br>
abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the aurora-<br>
2 protein has been found to be overexpressed. See<br>
Bischoff et al., EMBO J., 1998, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher<br>
et al., J. Cell Biol., 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 13766-13771.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and ß<br>
isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes tCoghlan<br>
et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and<br>
Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev., 10, 508-514 (2000)].<br>
GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including<br>
diabetes, Alzheimer"s disease, CNS disorders such as<br>
manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases,<br>
and cardiomyocete hypertrophy [WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675;<br>
and Haq et al., J. Cell Biol. (2000) 151, 117]. These<br>
diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which<br>
GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been found to<br>
phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of<br>
regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen<br>
synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for<br>
glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor ß-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP<br>
citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc,<br>
c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBoc. These diverse protein targets<br>
implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism,<br>
proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant<br>
for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced<br>
signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. Along this pathway, GSK-3 is a negative<br>
regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the<br>
presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated<br>
phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase.<br>
The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen<br>
synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93,<br>
8455-9 (1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-26<br>
(1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993);<br>
Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299, 123-128 (1994)].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient where the insulin response<br>
is impaired, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail<br>
to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood<br>
levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and long term effects that<br>
may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal<br>
failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal<br>
insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It<br>
has also been reported that in patients with type II<br>
diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 therefore are considered<br>
to be useful for treating diabetic patients suffering<br>
from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
GSK-3 activity has also been associated with<br>
Alzheimer"s disease. This disease is characterized by<br>
the well-known ß-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The<br>
neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau<br>
protein where Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal<br>
sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation<br>
of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Current Biology 4,<br>
1077-86 (1994); Brownlees et al., Weuroreport 8, 3251-55<br>
(1997)]. Therefore, it is believed that GSK-3 activity<br>
may promote generation of the neurofibrillary tangles and<br>
the progression of Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
Another substrate of GSK-3 is P-catenin which<br>
is degradated after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced<br>
levels of p-catenin have been reported in schizophrenic<br>
patients and have also been associated with other<br>
diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death<br>
[Zhong et al. , Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et<br>
al., PNAS, 90, 7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathol. Exp, 56, 70-78 (1997)].<br>
As a result of the biological importance of<br>
GSK-3, there is current interest in therapeutically<br>
effective GSK-3 inhbitors. Small molecules that inhibit<br>
GSK-3 have recently been reported [WO 99/65897 (Chiron)<br>
and WO 00/38675 (SmithKline Beecham)].<br>
For many of the aforementioned diseases<br>
associated with abnormal GSK-3 activity, other protein<br>
kinases have also been targeted for treating the same<br>
diseases. However, the various protein kinases often act<br>
through different biological pathways. For example,<br>
certain quinazoline derivatives have been reported<br>
recently as inhibitors of p38 kinase (WO 00/12497 to<br>
Scios). The compounds are reported to be useful for .<br>
treating conditions characterized by enhanced p38-a<br>
activity and/or enhanced TGF-ß activity. While p38<br>
activity has been implicated in a wide variety of<br>
diseases, including diabetes, p38 kinase is not reported<br>
to be a constituent of an insulin signaling pathway that<br>
regulates glycogen synthesis or glucose uptake.<br>
Therefore, unlike GSK-3, p38 inhibition would not be<br>
expected to enhance glycogen synthesis and/or glucose<br>
uptake.<br>
There is a continued need to find new<br>
therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. The protein<br>
kinases Aurora-2 and GSK-3 are especially attractive<br>
targets for the discovery of new therapeutics due to<br>
their important roles in cancer and diabetes,<br>
respectively.<br>

which are completely saturated or which contain one or<br>
more units of unsaturation but which are not aromatic.<br>
For example, suitable aliphatic groups include<br>
substituted or unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic<br>
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such<br>
as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or<br>
(cycloalkyl)alkenyl. The terms "alkyl", "alkoxy",<br>

alone or as part of a larger moiety shall include both<br>
straight and branched chainsjrontaining two to twelve<br>
carbon atoms. The term "cyloalkyl" used alone or as<br>
part of a larger moiety shall include cyclic C3-C12<br>
hydrocarbons which are completely saturated or which<br>
contain one or more units of unsaturation, but which are<br>
not aromatic.<br>
 The terms "haloalkyl", "haloalkenyl" and<br>
"haloalkoxy" means alkyl, alkenyl or alkoxy, as the case<br>
may be, substituted with one or more halogen atoms. The<br>

or sulfur and includes any oxidized form of nitrogen and<br>
sulfur, and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen.<br>
Also the term "nitrogen" includes a substitutable<br>
nitrogen of a heterocyclic ring. As an example, in a<br>
saturated or partially unsaturated ring having 0-3<br>
heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the<br>
nitrogen may be N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl) , NH (as<br>

or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as<br>
used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial,<br>
intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional<br>
and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
Preferably, the compositions are administered orally,<br>
intraperitoneally or intravenously.<br>
Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution<br>
in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer"s<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed<br>
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any<br>
bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-<br>
or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and<br>
its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation<br>
of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil,<br>
especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil<br>
solutions or suspensions, may also contain a long-chain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly<br>
used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other<br>
commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and<br>
other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers<br>
which are commonly used in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other<br>
dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In<br>
the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used<br>
include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents,<br>
such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added.<br>
For oral administration in a capsule form, useful<br>
diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When<br>
aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or<br>
coloring agents may also be added.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-<br>
irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt<br>
in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials<br>
include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
Topical application for the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in<br>
one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
In addition to the compounds of this invention,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs of<br>
the compounds of this invention may also be employed in<br>
compositions to treat or prevent the above-identified<br>
diseases or disorders.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or<br>
prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound<br>
of this invention which, upon administration to a<br>
recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or<br>
indirectly, a compound of this invention or an<br>
inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those<br>
that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of<br>
this invention when such compounds are administered to a<br>
patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered<br>
compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or<br>
which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a<br>
biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic<br>
system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention include, without limitation,<br>
the following derivatives of the present compounds:<br>
esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts<br>
sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include those derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids<br>
and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include<br>
acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate,<br>
camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate,<br>

palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate,<br>
phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate,<br>
succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and<br>
undecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in<br>
themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed<br>
in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N+(C1-4 alkyl)4<br>
salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization<br>
of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds<br>
disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products may be obtained by such quaternization.<br>
The amount of the protein kinase inhibitor that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
Preferably, the compositions should be formulated so that<br>
a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br>
the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving<br>
these compositions.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
the inhibitor will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound in the composition.<br>
Depending upon the particular protein kinase-<br>
mediated condition to be treated or prevented, additional<br>
therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to<br>
treat or prevent that condition, may be administered<br>
together with the inhibitors of this invention. For<br>
example, in the treatment of cancer other<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliterative<br>
agents may be combined with the present compounds to<br>
treat cancer. These agents include, without limitation,<br>
adriamycin, dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,<br>
fluorouracil, topotecan, taxol, interferons, and platinum<br>
derivatives.<br>

agents for treating blood disorders such as<br>
corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth<br>
factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency<br>
disorders such as gamma globulin.<br>
Those additional agents may be administered<br>
separately from the protein kinase inhibitor-containing<br>
composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen.<br>
Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single<br>
dosage form, mixed together with the protein kinase<br>
inhibitor of this invention in a single composition.<br>
Compounds of this invention may exist in<br>
alternative tautomeric forms, as in tautomers i and ii<br>

which/ upon oxidation of the methylsulfanyl group,<br>
provides the methylsulfone 9. The methylsulfonyl group<br>
of 9 may be displaced readily with Rl-QH to give the<br>
desired product I. See J. Am. Chem. Soc., 81, 5997-6006<br>

methylsulfanylpyrimidine 10 may be prepared as described<br>
in J. Med. Chem., 27, 12, 1621-1629 (1984). The chloro<br>
groups of intermediate 11 may be displaced sequentially<br>
with aminopyrazole (or aminoindazole) 2 and then with<br>
another amine (or alcohol or thiol) following procedures<br>
similar to those reported in US Patent 2585906 (ICI,<br>
1949) . The methylsulfanyl group of 13 may then, be<br>
oxidized to provide the methylsulfone 14. Displacement<br>
of the methylsulfonyl group of 14 gives the desired<br>
product II.<br><br>

methods described above at Scheme I step (b).<br>
Method A. To a solution of 2,4-<br>
dichloroguinazoline (12.69g, 63mmol) and 3-amino-5-<br>
methylpyrazole (6.18g, 63mmol) in ethanol (220mL) is<br>
added triethylamine (8.13mL, 63mmol) and the reaction<br>
mixture is stirred for 3 hours at room temperature. The<br>
pale yellow precipitate is then collected by filtration,<br>
washed with cold ethanol and dried under vacuum to give<br>
(2-chloroquinazolin-4-yl)-(5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-<br>
amine.<br>
The above-prepared (2-chloroquinazolin-4-yl)-<br>
(5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine (155 mg, 0.6 mmol) and<br>
3-chloroaniline (0.316 mL, 2.99 mmol) are refluxed in<br>
tert-butanol (3 mL) over 20 h. The mixture is<br>
concentrated in vacuo and the residue is suspended in<br>
EtOH/H2O (1mL/3mL) . K2CO3 (83 mg, 0.6 mmol) is added and<br>
the suspension is stirred for 2h at room temperature.<br>
The solid that forms is collected and dried under vacuum<br>
to give the product [2-(3-ehlorophenylamino)-quinazolin-<br>
4-yl] - (5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine.<br>
Method B. Sodium hydride (45 mg, 1.12 mmol) in<br>
THF (2 mL) is treated with 3-methoxyphenol (0.94g, 7.6<br>
mmol) and the reaction mixture is stirred until<br>
effervescence ceases. The THF is removed in vacuo and<br>
the above-prepared(2-chloroquinazolin-4-yl)-(5-methyl-<br>
2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine (150 mg, 0.51 mmol)) is added.<br>
The reaction mixture is stirred at 100°c for 20 h, then<br>
poured into aqueous K?CO3 and stirred for 2h at room<br>
temperature. The solid that forms is collected and re-<br>
crystallized from ethanol to give the product [2-(3-<br>
methoxyphenoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-<br>
yl)-amine.<br>
Method C. To a solution of 4-hydroxy-2-<br>
phenoxymethylquinazoline (2 g, 7.93 mmol) in phosphorus<br>
oxychloride (10mL) is added tripropylamine (3.02 mL, 15.8<br>
mmol) and the reaction mixture is heated for 30 minutes<br>
at 110°C. The excess phosphorus oxychloride is<br>
evaporated in vacuo, the residue is poured on ice cold<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The<br>
organic layer is washed with brine, dried, filtered and<br>
evaporated. The resulting residue is purified on flash<br>
chromatography (SiO2, hexane /AcOEt gradient) to give 4-<br>
chloro-2-phenoxymethylquinazoline.<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING<br>
The activity of the compounds as protein kinase<br>
inhibitors may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell<br>
line. In vitro assays include assays that determine<br>
inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or<br>
ATPase activity of the activated protein kinase.<br>
Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the<br>
inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase. Inhibitor<br>
binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor<br>
prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/protein kinase<br>
complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound.<br>
Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by<br>
running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are<br>
incubated with the protein kinase bound to known<br>
radioligands.<br>
BIOLOGICAL TESTING EXAMPLE 1<br>
Ki DETERMINATION FOR THE INHIBITION OF GSK-3<br>
Compounds were screened for their ability to<br>
inhibit GSK-3ß (AA 1-420) activity using a standard<br>
coupled enzyme system (Fox et al. (1998) Protein Sci. 7,<br>
2249). Reactions were carried out in a solution<br>
containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl,<br>
300 µM NADH, 1 mM DTT and 1.5% DMSO. Final substrate<br>
concentrations in the assay were 20 µM ATP (Sigma<br>
Chemicals, St Louis, MO) and 300 µM peptide<br>
(HSSPHQS(PO3H2)EDEEE, American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA) .<br>
Reactions were carried out at 30 °C and 20 nM GSK-3ß.<br>
Final concentrations of the components of the coupled<br>
enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 300 µM<br>
NADH, 30 µg/ml pyruvate kinase and 10 µg/ml lactate<br>
dehydrogenase.<br>
An assay stock buffer solution was prepared<br>
containing all of the reagents listed above with the<br>
exception of ATP and the test compound of interest. The<br>
assay stock buffer solution (175 µl) was incubated in a<br>
96 well plate with 5 ul of the test compound of interest<br>
at final concentrations spanning 0.002 µM to 30 µM at 30°C<br>
for 10 min. Typically, a 12 point titration was<br>
conducted by preparing serial dilutions (from 10 mM<br>
compound stocks) with DMSO of the test compounds in<br>
daughter plates. The reaction was initiated by the<br>
addition of 20 µl of ATP (final concentration 20 µM).<br>
Rates of reaction were obtained using a Molecular Devices<br>
Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA) over 10 min at<br>
30oC. The Ki values were determined from the rate data as<br>
a function of inhibitor concentration.<br>

SRC INHIBITION ASSAY<br>
The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of<br>
human Src kinase using either a radioactivity-based assay<br>
or spectrophotometric assay.<br>
Src Inhibition Assay A: Radioactivity-based Assay<br>
The compounds were assayed as inhibitors of<br>
full length recorabinant human Src kinase (from Upstate<br>
Biotechnology, cat. no. 14-117) expressed and purified<br>
from baculo viral cells. Src kinase activity was<br>
monitored by following the incorporation of 33P from ATP<br>
into the tyrosine of a random poly Glu-Tyr polymer<br>
substrate of composition, Glu:Tyr = 4:1 (Sigma, cat. no.<br>
P-027S). The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.05 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 2<br>
mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 10 µM ATP (1-2 µCi 33P-ATP per<br>
reaction) , 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 1-2 units of<br>
recorabinant human Src kinase. In a typical assay, all<br>
the reaction components with the exception of ATP were<br>
pre-mixed and aliguoted into assay plate wells.<br>
Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were added to the wells to<br>
give a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate<br>
was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min before initiating the<br>
reaction with 33P-ATP. After 20 min of reaction, the<br>
reactions were quenched with 150 µl of 10%<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 20 mM Na3P04. The<br>
quenched samples were then transferred to a 96-well<br>
filter plate (Whatman, UNI-Filter GF/F Glass Fiber<br>
Filter, cat no. 7700-3310) installed on a filter plate<br>
vacuum manifold. Filter plates were washed four times<br>
with 10% TCA containing 20 mM Na3PO4 and then 4 times with<br>
methanol. 200ul of scintillation fluid was then added to<br>
each well. The plates were sealed and the amount of<br>
radioactivity associated with the filters was quantified<br>
on a TopCount scintillation counter. The radioactivity<br>
incorporated was plotted as a function of the inhibitor<br>
concentration. The data was fitted to a competitive<br>
inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>
Src Inhibition Assay B: Spectrophototnetric Assay<br>
The ADP produced from ATP by the human<br>
recombinant Src kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of poly<br>
Glu-Tyr substrate was quanitified using a coupled enzyme<br>
assay (Fox et al (1998) Protein Sci 7, 2249). In this<br>
assay one molecule of NADH is oxidised to NAD for every<br>
molecule of ADP produced in the kinase reaction. The<br>
disappearance of NADH can be conveniently followed at 340<br>
nm.<br>
The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.02S M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2,<br>
2 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 25 nM of<br>
recombinant human Src kinase. Final concentrations of the<br>
components of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM<br>
phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 µM NADH, 30 µg/ml pyruvate<br>
kinase and 10 µg/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
In a typical assay, all the reaction components<br>
with the exception of ATP were pre-mixed and aliquoted<br>
into assay plate wells. Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO<br>
were added to the wells to give a final DMSO concentration<br>
of 2.5%. The assay plate was incubated at 30oC for 10 min<br>
before initiating the reaction with 100 µM ATP. The<br>
absorbance change at 340 nm with time, the rate of the<br>
reaction, was monitored on a molecular devices plate<br>
reader. The data of rate as a function of the inhibitor<br>
concentration was fitted to compettive inhibition<br>
kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>
