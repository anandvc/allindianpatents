				<td>PROTEIN A PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION WITHOUT USING ANIMAL DERIVED COMPONENTS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 10001] This invention relates to methods for the purification of vegetarian (non-animal derived) Protein A using a multidimensional purification process to remove undesirable non-animal derived component impurities in the Protein A from the non-animal fermentation media used to produce the Protein A so as to produce a vegetarian Protein A free of animal-origin components and essentially free of components derived from non-animal derived growth media.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002) Protein A is a cell wall protein made by Staphylococcus aureus. The immunoglobulin-binding protein of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Protein A, binds strongly to the Fc region of immunoglobulins from human, guinea pig, pig, and rabbit. See Langone, (1982) Adv. Immunol. 32:157 and Lindmark (1983) J. Immunol. Methods 62:1. Protein A binds, to a lesser extent, to immunoglobulin M (IgM) having a VH3 region, without affecting immunoglobulin affinity for antigen. Protein A is used commercially to purify monoclonal antibodies that are often in turn used as therapeutics in human diseases like inflammatory diseases and cancer. Also, Protein A can itself be used as a therapeutic. Protein A can be administered to a patient in order to bind circulating immune complexes in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or to stimulate specific cytokine production in someone with an infection. In addition, when coupled to a chromatography resin, Protein A can act as a therapeutic absorber to treat plasma or whole blood by removing IgG complexes in disorders like autoimmune disease and transplant organ rejection. [0003] In some strains of S. aureus the Protein A remains bound to the cell wall while in some others (secretors), Protein A is released as a soluble protein product of molecular weight 40-55,000 into the growth media. See Lindmark, (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 74:623. Protein A is extensively used in the commercial production of monoclonal antibodies. Soluble and functional Protein A and functional fragments of Protein A representing several of the 5 IgG binding domains of Protein A have been produced by molecular cloning, all of which demonstrated affinity for IgG. Typically, the clones are expressed in bacteria which have been grown in media partially or wholly derived from animal sources, such as bovine milk caseins, mammalian meat stocks or broths.<br>
[0004] Originally, Protein A was derived from the S. aureus cell wall, but bacterial strains which secrete the protein have been isolated and are also used to obtain Protein A, However, the preparation of Protein A by conventional methods presents a problem for its use in human therapeutics. S aureus is grown in media that contains animal products as a source of amino acids for the bacteria. In particular, bovine hydrolysates and extracts are commonly used as supplements in bacterial growth media. Hence, obtaining Protein A from growth media containing animal-derived products leads to the possibility that animal products like prions, the causative agent in Mad Cow, Scrapie and wasting disease, could be present in the media and transmitted to human patients. Protein A preparations can<br><br>
also be exposed to and contaminated with animal products during downstream purification processes. For example, in methods currently used, Protein A is purified using an IgG Sepharose chromatography column and the IgG coupled to the Sepharose chromatography column is typically of animal origin. However, the animal products that come to be associated with a Protein A preparation during the isolation and purification processes are not easily purified from the preparation by the methods presently known.<br>
[0005] Recent health concerns related to the transmission of various wasting diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), one of several diseases categorized as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), prion-related diseases, has prompted the removal of animal-derived materials from bacterial growh media where any product obtained from bacteria growing in such media might come in contact with humans. Thus, vegetable-derived media has begun replacing animal-derived media for growing microbes which are designed to produce a product that ultimately becomes a medicinal agent, such as vitamins, amino acids, or therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. Hence, there is the need for a commercially viable means to manufacture and purify a non-animal derived Protein A for use in therapeutic antibodies that must have high purity, binding properties at least equal to commonly used Protein A and assurance of animal-free growth conditions and purification processes,<br>
[0006] Purification processes developed long ago for isolating products from animal-derived microbial fermentations were designed to remove unwanted components produced by the microbe in the fermentation process or fortuitously added as a part of the growth media and either altered by the microbe or Idft unaltered. Years of practice in the art of purification led to numerous processes to accomplish such purifications. However, in cases such as the isolation of a soluble protein secreted by the microbe into the medium, much of the purification process revolved around removing the media components which were added in high levels to promote rapid growth and efficient production of the product of interest, in the event of a switch of media ingredients, a new spectrum of contaminants will likely appear, thus, there will be the need to remove them from the product of interest. However, they may not purify out by the protocols developed for isolations from previous media. Hence, the change from animal-derived growth media to non-animal-derived media components introduces a variety of challenges to the purification process, such as differences in solubilities of media components, carbohydrate content, lipid content, protein content, particulates, viscosity, etc. Each of these have bearing on the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of the process developed originally for animal-derived growth media fermentations and growth. [0007] Protein A derived from aimal origin is normally purified by either of two methods, a "classical" method using some combination of ion exchange columns and/or size exclusion columns or affinity columns, employing a purified immunoglobulin (animal derived) attached covalently to an insoluble matrix such as Agarose or silica. In order to produce a Protein A product that is free of animal-derived contaminants, it is necessary to remove any animal-derived product from its recent history and from the fermentation process and also from the purification process. Thus, It becomes necessary to isolate a stock culture of the growth organism in uniquely non-animal-derived culture media, grow the microbe in non-animal-derived media and purify the Protein A product using non-animal-derived media to such an extent<br><br>
that it is free of contaminating bacterial proteins and components derived from the media. [0008] Attempts to purify Protein A by classical methods from S. aureus grown on conventional animal-derived media gave a typical protein product with high purity as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis and analytical chromatography with a typical UV spectrum for Protein A (See Sjoquist, (1972) Eur. J. Biochem. 29:572). At concentrations of 1-10 mg/mL, the solution was nearly colorless. However, in our initials trials using S. aureus grown on non-animal-derived media and purified by the same process, the Protein A product had a yellow color and gave a substantial absorbance In the high UV and visible region (300-450 nm), but gave the same pattern on SDS gel electrophoresis, indicating high purity. This suggested there were non-protein contaminants present. Indeed, 1-5 mg/mL solutions of such a Protein A were a distinct yellow brown, a color resembling a diluted version of the growth media. Thus It appeared that the extant purification procedures were not removing all the non-animal derived growth media components. Thus there developed a need to provide a new, improved purification process for purifying vegetarian derived Protein A.<br>

The invention further comprises a method of binding antibodies or antibody fragments to a chromatographic resin by contacting the antibodies or antibody fragments with the purified vegetarian Protein A chromatographic resin. The invention further comprises the antibody or antibody fragments bound to the purified Protein A chromatographic resin.<br><br>
[0011] Thislnvenfion provides a bacterial fermentation in non-animal-derived growth media to give a high concentration of Protein A in the exudates which is purified using diafiltration and columns to yield a product that is &gt;95% pure by SDS gel electrophoresis and by chemical and physical tests is substantially identical with Protein A purified from spent culture media of animal-derived origin. Further, contaminants left over from the non-animal growth medium have virtually been eliminated. In an embodiment of this invention a seed culture of S, aureus var. IMRE known to secrete Protein A was serially grown through 2 cuiturings to eliminate animal-derived media carry-over in the seed culture. Seed culture stocks were transferred to approximately 400 sterile culture vials and maintained at -70° C until needed. Seed cultures were used to inoculate 2 liters of non-animal derived media composed of 1.8% Soy Peptone (Sigma), 5% yeast extract (Sigma), 0.5% sodium chloride (Mallinckrodt Baker). 0.25% dextrose, 0.25% potassium phosphate, dibasic (Fisher), in water and NaOH to render pH 7.5. Growth at 37° C was encouraged with aeration and pH maintenance by additions of 1 M phosphoric acid or sodium hydroxide for 16 hours, then this innoculum was transferred to a 16 liter growth chamber containing the same composition of media and growth was continued at 37°C with aeration at 16 I/minute for at least 10 hours or until the absorbance units at 560 nm reached 52. Then, a larger run may be made by using this 16 liter culture as innoculum for a larger, say 375 liter, fermentor containing the same medium previously sterilized and again allow growth at 1 Liter air per minute per liter of media for sufficient time to reach approximately 50 absorbance units at 560 nm. Cells were removed by centrifugation or by filtration through 0.1 micron filters and the broth/culture media was then filtered through a Millipore PROCON 10,000 MWCO IFF membrane to retain the Protein A, reduce the salt concentration and concentration of lower molecular weight components and to exchange the buffer. The resultant concentrated protein/broth solution was then applied to an appropriate column which was then washed with a buffered solution then the Protein A was eluted in either a gradient or step elution with higher salt concentrations. A pool was made of active fractions of appropriate purity and either simply diluted with water to an appropriate salt concentration or diaflow treated to concentrate and exchange buffers. This protein solution was then applied to a second column which was washed, then the Protein A eluted with a buffered higher salt concentration and fractions pooled to obtain Protein A at a recovery of 80-100%, purity &gt; 95% by  nm was greater than 7.0. Appropriate columns might be either an anion exchange matrix, a ceramic hydroxyapatite matrix, hydrophobic matrix or a cation exchange matrix. The anion exchange matrix may be any of the useful anion exchange resins though the preferred embodiment of the invention is XWP 500 PolyQuat-35 (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7603) pre-equiiibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.S. The preferred ceramic hydroxyapatite matrix (Bio-Rad) was pre-equiiibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8. The cation exchange matrix may be any of the useful cation exchange resins though the preferred embodiment of the invention is WP carboxy-sulfone (weak-strong cation exchanger) (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7587) pre-equiiibrated with 137 mM acetic acid~triethanolamine*-30 mM NaCl, pH 4.5-6.0, Typically, after the second ion exchange column, the Protein A solution may be dialyzed or diafiltered to remove the bulk of the salt and buffer components then frozen and lyophillzed.<br><br>

[0013]   in one aspect the invention comprises:<br>

[0014] Protein A can be obtained from any Protein A-producing strain of S. aureus including those strains that are naturally-occun-ing, isolated or genetically engineered. Protein A-producing strains of S. aureus can also Include those strains in which Protein A remains embedded in the cell wall and those strains that secrete Protein A into the growth media, preferably S. aureus, var Imre, for instance. Methods by which Protein A can be recovered from the S. aureus cell wall (e.g., enzyme digestion) are well known by those with skill in the art. Protein A recovered in this manner can be purified to eliminate the digested cellular components. It is preferable, however, to obtain Protein A from Staphylococcus strains that secrete Protein A into the media such that it is only necessary to harvest the Protein A from the media. [0015]  Seed cultures designed to be free of animal-source nutrients and components were obtained<br><br>
from stocks of S.aureus by serial plating on media of microbiological-derived and vegetable-derived components and nutrients. Several media compositions gave good growth with varying amounts of Protein A in the exudates, especially dependent on the yeast extract content of the medium. A disadvantage of the non-animal derived media is the greater color intensity produced in the initial Protein A solution. Initial efforts to purify the Protein A using previously adopted means gave a product with a substantial amount of color compared to Protein A purified in the same manner from less colorful animal-derived media. Employing the multidimensional exchange column process of this invention significantly reduced or substantially eliminated this Impurity coloration. Protein A eluted from a second chromatography column in accordance with the process of this invention substantially reduced color content giving a Protein A of high purity {&gt;98% by SDS gels) that was essentially identical physically and chemically to Protein A isolated from animal-derived media sources.<br>
[0015] As referred to herein, "animal products" are defined as any material transmitted or derived from a non-human animal, the material including peptides, proteins, amino acids, protein-like materials, nucleic acids, viruses and the like. As referred to herein, the term "vegetarian Protein A" is defined as a Protein A composition uncontaminated by animal products or any animal-derived peptides that are derived from the fermentation media or the purification media. Similarly, the term "vegetarian media" refers to fermentation media uncontaminated by animal products or any animal-derived peptides. As used herein, the term "vegetarian amino acids or peptides" refers to any peptides, proteins, amino acids or protein-like materials that are not derived from a non-human animal.<br>
[0017] The following is a brief description of the materials and methods employed in this invention. The materials and methods are illustrative of, but not limited to, those materials and methods that may be employed in the process of this invention.<br>
[0018] Stock of Seed cultures derived from S. aureus var. IMRE, Secretor bacteria can be fermented In any amount of vegetarian media sufficient to grow the bacteria and produce the desired amount of Protein A. Most preferably, the S. aureus are grown in a large scale manufacturing batch in fermentor tanks. Fermentation conditions (i.e., airflow, temperature, agitation, pH and pressure) can be controlled and/or monitored electronically, with, for example, a microprocessor, or by any other electronic means. Some particularly preferred conditions include fermentation of the 5. aureus at about 37° and an airflow of about a liter/minute of sterile air per liter of media. The media can consist of the components of conditioned media for S. aureus growth that are known in the art, typically, yeast extract, glucose and essential salts, and, in the case of the invention, includes vegetarian amino adds and peptides {e.g„ soy, pea hydrolyzate or cotton seed hydrolyzate peptide) as a source of amino acids. Vegetarian amino acids or peptides could, for instance, be derived from any non-animal (e.g. plant or plant-like) or synthetic (e.g., chemically synthesized) source and in one embodiment of the invention, the vegetarian amino acids or peptides are derived from soy. The components can be at a concentration of about 50 grams/liter (g/L) yeast extract, 15 g/L soy peptides and 5 to 10 g/L glucose dissolved in purified, deionfzed water with diluted phosphoric acid and diluted sodium hydroxide added as needed during fermentation to control the pH at between about 7 and 8. The media can further contain at least 0,67 milliliters/liter (mUL) of polyethylene glycol to prevent foaming In the fermentation mixture. Preferably, a<br><br>
small culture of S. aureus van IMRE was streaked onto sterile agar media composed of non-animal-derived components: 1.8% Soy Peptone (Sigma). 5% yeast extract (Sigma), 0.5% sodium chloride (Mallinckrodt Baker), 0.25% dextrose, 0.25% potassium phosphate, dibasic (Fisher). 3% agar (Dlfco) in water and NaOH to render pH 7.5. The plate was incubated at 37°C overnight. Using a single colony from this plate, a transfer was made to another plate of the same composition by streaking and allowed to grow under the same conditions overnight. A single colony from this second streak was transferred to 100 mL of sterile non-animal-derived liquid media sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 25 minutes: 1.8% Soy Peptone (Sigma), 5% yeast extract (Sigma), 0.5% sodium chloride (Mallinckrodt Baker), 0.25% dextrose and 0,25% potassium phosphate, dibasic (Fisher) in water and NaOH to render pH 7.5. This liquid culture was agitated at 300 RPM overnight at 37 °C. Ten mL of this liquid culture was then used to inoculate a 16 liter fermentor containing 12 liters of non-animal derived media sterilized by autoclaving: 3% Select APS™ TSB (Becton-Dickinson and Co.) and 0.08% polyethylene glycol. The culture was grown at 37 °C with aeration at about 12 L/minute while stirring at 400 RPM for at least 10 hours or to a cell density of 52 absorbance units at 560 nm. The pH was maintained at 7.0 +/- 0.5 with dilute NaOH and dilute phosphoric acid. Portions of the cultured broth were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 30 minutes to concentrate the ceils. The concentrated cell mass was suspended with approximately 4 volumes of media sterilized by autoclaving: 3% Select APS™ TSB (Becton-Dickinson and Co.) and 0.08% polyethylene glycol. Approximately 4-5 mL portions of the cell suspension were transferred into each of about 400-500 sterile vials and stored at -70°C until needed. Approximately 5% of the vials were tested to verify bacterial purity. Additionally, The fermentation broth can be assessed visually under a microscope to ensure the broth is not contaminated with other microorganisms. Simliarly, the S. aureus in the culture can be inspected using a microscope for the proper morphology which includes having: the shape of gram positive cocci, pleiomorphism (i.e., single colonies, chains or roseates) and a size of approximately 0.6 microns. The cultured S. aureus can also be assessed for quality and health by determining if they exhibit a round, raised, grayish morphology on blood agar plates, have an ability to cause the β-hemolysIs of sheep blood after 48 hours and test positive for the enzymes coagulase and catalase.<br>
[0019] Desalting of the Column-eluted Protein A solution. Once the pool is obtained from the second column In the series, dialyze or diafilter against deionized or distilled water until essentially salt-free (conductivity less than 2 mS/cm). Dialysis membranes may include tubing membranes or cassettes containing walls made of cellulose membranes with MWCO 
 <br><br>
[0020] Analytical C, (HlC) Column. A WP Butyl (C4) Reverse Phase 4,6 X 250 mm column (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7116-00) was thoroughly pre-equilibrated with water:acetonitriie:trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0,1) (volumes) at 1.0 mL/minute using a Waters 515 HPLC Pump. Samples or standards were dissolved or diluted with water to 0.1 - 1,5 mg/mL and 0.025 mL injected and the effluent monitored at 214. 275 and 340 nm (Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector). Immediately after injection, a linear gradient was begun starting with equilibration buffer and ending at 30 minutes with a 50:50 mix of equilibration buffer and elution buffer (elution buffer is composed of water:acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid at 25:75:0.1). The column was rinsed for 1 minute with elution buffer (100%) then re-equilibrated with equilibration buffer for 35 minutes before the next sample was injected. Areas under absorbance peaKs at 214 nm were determined by the instrument. Standard samples of Protein A were made by dissolving 5 to 25 mg of dry purified Protein A in water to a concentration of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL and storing 0.35-0.85 mL in microcentrifuge tubes at -10 to-1° C until needed. A stock tube of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL frozen solution was thawed and diluted 1:1, 1:3, 1:7 and 1:15 with water to generate a set of concentration standards. Protein A typically eluted at 15-17 minutes. Areas under the standard Protein A peaks at 214 nm were plotted against the Protein A concentration of the standard applied to generate a standard curve. Areas obtained from test samples were compared with the standard curve to obtain the concentration of the sample. If the area of the sample exceeded the area obtained for the 1.5 mg/mL standard, the sample was diluted with water appropriately and run again.<br>
[0021] Analytical Size Exclusion Column. A standard size exclusion column (7.8 x 300 mm TSK-Gel G3000 SW (Tosoh)) was equilibrated with 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. containing 0,5 M NaCI. Typically, samples of 0.10 mL were applied and run at 0.5 mL/minute (Waters 515 HPLC Pump) while monitoring the effluent at 214, 280 and 340 nm (Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector). Areas under absorbance peaks at 214 nm were determined by the instrument. For quantitation of concentration, standard samples of Protein A were made by dissolving 5 to 25 mg of dry purified Protein A in water to a concentration of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL and storing 0.35-0.85 mL aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes at -10 to -15°C until needed. A stock tube of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL frozen solution was thawed and diluted 1:1, 1:3, and 1:7 with water to generate a set of concentration standards, Prote'tn A eluted at 15-16 minutes. Areas under the standard Protein A peaks at 214 nm were plotted against the Protein A concentration of the standard applied to generate a standard curve. Areas obtained from test samples were compared with the standard curve to obtain the concentration of the sample. If the area of the sample exceeded the area obtained for the 1.5 mg/mL standard, the sample was diluted with water appropriately and run again. For molecular weight estimation, standard test proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris-CI, pH 8 to give 1,0 mg/mL and 0,1 mL injected and run as above for the concentration standards.

[0020] Analytical C4 (HlC) Column. A WP Butyl (C4) Reverse Phase 4.6 X 250 mm column (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7116-00) was thoroughly pre-equilibrated with water:acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0.1) (volumes) at 1.0 mL/minute using a Waters 515 HPLC Pump. Samples or standards were dissolved or diluted with water to 0.1 - 1.5 mg/mL and 0.025 mL injected and the effluent monitored at 214. 275 and 340 nm (Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector). Immediately after injection, a linear gradient was begun starting with equilibration buffer and ending at 30 minutes with a 50:50 mix of equilibration buffer and elution buffer (elution buffer Is composed of water:acetonitrlle:thfluoroacetic acid at 25:75:0.1). The column was rinsed for 1 minute with elution buffer (100%) then re-equilibrated with equilibration buffer for 35 minutes before the next sample was injected. Areas under absorbance peaks at 214 nm were determined by the instrument. Standard samples of Protein A were made by dissolving 5 to 25 mg of dry purified Protein A in water to a concentration of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL and storing 0.35-0.85 mL in microcentrifuge tubes at -10 to-15° C until needed. A stock tube of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL frozen solution was thawed and diluted 1:1, 1:3, 1:7 and 1:15 with water to generate a set of concentration standards. Protein A typically eluted at 15-17 minutes. Areas under the standard Protein A peaks at 214 nm were plotted against the Protein A concentration of the standard applied to generate a standard curve. Areas obtained from test samples were compared with the standard curve to obtain the concentration of the sample. If the area of the sample exceeded the area obtained for the 1.5 mg/mL standard, the sample was diluted with water appropriately and run again.<br>
[0021] Analytical Size Exclusion Column. A standard size exclusion column (7.8 x 300 mm TSK-Get G3000 SW (Tosoh)) was equilibrated with 0.1 M sodium phosphate. pH 7,0, containing 0.5 M NaCl. Typically, samples of 0.10 mL were applied and run at 0.5 mL/minute (Waters 515 HPLC Pump) while monitoring the effluent at 214, 280 and 340 nm (Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector). Areas under absorbance peaks at 214 nm were determined by the instrument. For quantitation of concentration, standard samples of Protein A were made by dissolving 5 to 25 mg of dry purified Protein A in water to a concentration of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL and storing 0.35-0.85 mL aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes at -10 to -15" C until needed. A stock tube of 1.5 mg Protein A/mL frozen solution was thawed and diluted 1:1,1 ;3, and 1:7 with water to generate a set of concentration standards. Protein A eluted at 15-16 minutes. Areas under the standard Protein A peaks at 214 nm were piotted against the Protein A concentration of the standard applied to generate a standard curve. Areas obtained from test samples were compared with the standard curve to obtain the concentration of the sample. If the area of the sample exceeded the area obtained for the 1.5 mg/mL standard, the sample was diluted with water appropriately and run again. For molecular weight estimation, standard test proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris-CI, pH 8 to give 1.0 mg/mL and 0.1 mL injected and run as above for the concentration standards. For molecular weight estimation, a standard curve was obtained by plotting the log10 of the known molecular weight standard against the retention time of the standard. Retention times of protein peaks monitored at 214 nm or 280 nm in the samples were compared with the standard curve to obtain the molecular weight estimate of the sample's proteins. Protein A elutes at a position giving an estimated molecular weight of 85,000, considerably higher than the expected value of 40-50,000 from the known structure and data obtained by<br><br>

[0022] Denaturing Gel Electrophoresis. Solutions containing protein were diluted or dissolved with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-0.1 M dithiothreitol-6 M urea-0.125 M Tris-HCI, pH 6.8, to a final protein concentration of 0.1-1,0 mg/mL then heated to 65°C for 5-10 minutes and cooled to room temperature. Protein standards are obtained in a kit form from Sigma Chemical Co. or Bio-Rad. Between 1 and 25 microliters of protein solution may be applied to a polyacrylamide gel made commercially for the purpose of protein subunit (monomer) size determination such as 4-20% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad), 4-20% IGels (Gradigels), 4-20% Novex Pre-cast Gels (Invitrogen) or gels may be made as 12% or greater in acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (37.5/1 ratio) according to Laemmli (Laemmli, (1970) Nature 227:680).

[0023] Ultraviolet Spectral Properties of Protein A Isolated from Animal-derived and Non-animal-derived Media. Background absorbancies were taken on water in a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette on a Perkin-Elmer λ800 from 200 to 400 nm. Similarly, absorbancies were taken at 200-400 nm on protein samples with the background subtracted. If the absorbance at any wavelength In the 400 to 250 nm region exceeded 2.0 absorbance units, the sample was diluted with 2 equal parts of water and tested again. [0024] Absorbance Ratios at 275 and 340 nm. A spectrophotometer was blanked with water or buffer in which the Protein A may be dissolved in a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length to zero the instrument at 275 nm. Absorbance of any protein solution in question is read and recorded at the same wavelength in the same quartz cuvette. If it is recognized that the buffer in which the protein is dissolved absorbs light at either 275 nm or 340 nm, then the buffer in question should be used io blank the instrument rather than water. This process is repeated at 340 nm. The ratio of the absorbance at 275 nm to the absorbance at 340 nm is recorded as A275/A340 and for any Protein A eluted from a second column should exceed 7.0. [0025] Lyophilization of Purified Protein A. Protein A eluted from the second purification column is diafiltered against water or dialyzed against water to remove the bulk of salts and low molecular weight components. This solution is then frozen onto the sides of rotating bottles so as to form a shell of frozen liquid or frozen rap]6\y into large cold glass pans. The frozen solutions are cooled on a shelf set at -55° C until the temperature of the frozen solution has reached -15° G or lower at which time evacuation is begun with a vacuum pre-set to 200-250 mTorr and the shelf is set to -15° C. Freeze-drying is continued for 2 to 24 hours at which time the shelf temperature is raised to 0°C  until the product is visibly dry at which time the shelf temperature is raised to 23°C and held for at least 2 hours for final drying, at which time the dry white to light tan fluffy product is removed and may be kept refrigerated or in a freezer.<br>

If the choice for the second column is a ceramic hydroxyapatite, the protein solution is diafiltered to exchange the buffer to 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. A 16 x 72 cm column of ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) is equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and the protein solution is loaded onto the column at 100-150 cm/hour, The flow is continued with a wash of the same buffer for 3-5 column volumes then Protein A eluted with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate.

Non-bound components were washed off the column with 3-10 column volumes of fresh equilibration buffer, then the Protein A was eluted from the column with 20 mM Tris-CI, pH 7.8 adjusted to a conductivity of 18 mS/cm with NaCl. Protein A concentration and purity were determined on fractions using an analytical C4 (HlC) reverse phase column and by monitoring absorbance at 214, 275 and 340 nm on a Waters Photodiode Array Detector. Fractions of Protein A were pooled such that the recovery is 85-100% and such that the pool exhibited an A275/A340 ratio of 7.0 or higher. The Protein A pool was titrated to pH 4.5-6.0 with dilute HCl and then diluted with water to a conductivity of 4.0-7.3 mS/cm and applied to a 16 x 72 cm WP carboxy-sulfone column (weak'-strong cation exchanger) pre-equilibrated with 137 mM acetic acid-triethanolamine-30 mM NaCl, pH 4,5-6.0 with pH 4.7 being the preferred embodiment, at a flow rate of 100-300 cm/hour.

Column. In another preferred embodiment, the Protein A solution was applied to a cation exchange column WP carboxy-sulfone (weak-strong cation exchanger) (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7587). The solution from 375 liters of fermentation broth was diafiltered through a Millipore PROCON 10,000 MWCO TFF membrane to retain the Protein A, reduce the salt concentration and concentration of lower molecular weight components, reduce the volume of solution and to exchange the buffer to 137 mM acetic acid-triethanoIamine-30 mM NaCI. pH 4.5-6.0, the preferred pH being 4.7. Alternatively, the protein solution may simply be filtered through a 0.2 micron filter, pH adjusted to 4.7-6.0 with 1 N HCI or 1 N NaOH, and diluted with water to a conductivity of 4.0 - 7.0 mS/cm. This protein solution was clarified (if necessary) by filtration through a 0.2 micron filter then applied to a 16 x 72 cm WP carboxy-sulfone (weak-strong cation exchanger) (Mallinckrodt Baker # 7587) equilibrated with 137 mM acetic acid-triethanolamine-30 mM NaCI, pH 4.5-6.0, the preferred pH being 4.7 at a flow rate of 100-300 cm/minute.

Protein A concentration and purity were determined on fractions using an analytical C4 (HIC) reverse phase coiumn and by monitoring absorbance at 214, 275 and 340 nm on a Waters Photodiode Array Detector Fractions of Protein A were pooled such that the recovery was 85-100% and such that the pool exhibited an A275/A340 ratio of 7.0 or higher. Using diaflow or dialysis, the protein solution pool was exchanged to give 20 mM Tris-CI, pH 7.8 and to reduce the volume of the solution. This protein solution was applied to a 10.5 X 72 cm column of XWP 500 PolyQuat'35 with a Waters 515 HPLC pump at a flow rate of 5.5 - 8.0 cm/minute. Non-bound components were washed off the column with 3-10 column volumes of fresh equilibration buffer, then the Protein A was eluted from the column with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8 adjusted to a conductivity of 18 mS/cm with NaCl. Protein A concentration and purity were determined on fractions using an analytical C4 (HIC) reverse phase column and by monitoring absorbance at 214, 275 and 340 nm on a Waters Photodiode Array Detector. Fractions of Protein A were pooled such that the recovery is 85-100% and such that the pool exhibits an A275/A340 ratio of 7.0 or higher.<br>
[0031] (6) Identity Between Protein A Isolated from Animal-derived and Non-animal-derived Media Protein A was separately purified from S. aureus cells grown in animal-derived media or non-animal-derived media using, in sequence, anion exchange then cation exchange in some cases and cation exchange followed by anion exchange in other cases. Each purified protein was then tested for co-migration on SDS gels and non-denaturing gels (Laemmli gels without SDS in either the sample nor in the gel itself). The two separate proteins migrated at the same rate in both systems, respectively. The separate Protein A's were submitted to a commercial lab for amino acid analysis using 6 N HCI, N-terminal sequence analysis and for peptide mapping. For both proteins, the amino acid analysis was comparable. N-terminat analysts of the first six amino acids matched though a small amount of valine appeared in the non-animal-derived Protein A that was not in the first amino acid removed in the animal-derived Protein A, Peptide mapping was carried out on the two proteins by digesting with trypsin and separating the resultant peptides by HPLC.   The elution profile of the two were virtually identical, the<br><br>
exception being that two peaks eluted from the non-animal-derlved Protein A fragmentation eluting at 61.5 and at 87 minutes was not present in the animal-derived Protein A fragmentation and the peak that eluted at 92 minutes on the animal-derived was much larger on the non-animal-derlved. This combination of events could have resulted from incomplete breakdown of a larger peptide in the non-animal Protein A fragments. Othenwise, there was nearly perfect similarity between the two patterns. Each of the two Protein A's were run on isoelectric focusing gels also giving similar patterns, the predominant protein bands having isoelectric points of pH 5.1, 4.9 and 4.7 when compared with standard proteins of horse heart myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase and p-lactoglobulin.<br>
