				<td>LUBRICANT FOR HOT FORGING APPLICATIONS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Forged metal articles are frequently used for various parts in many items, including airplanes, autorrsobiles, electronic components, etc. Iron has traditionally been the metal of choice for most forged metal applications, however the preferred material for many recent applications is changing from iron to lighter alloys, such as aluminum alloys, in order to meet the demand for reducing the overall weight of the material. In recent years, the demand for lightweight products of high quality with good workability has increased and has led to a similar increase in the use of aluminum alloy forging technology.<br>
In the metal forging work or process, a lubricant or lubricating oil is disposed betv/een the metal mold and the workpiece to be molded so as to avoid adhesion between them and to improve the separation ability of the forged article from the metal mold. The proper lubricant is critical in order to allow for proper movement in ihe die cavities and to allow the forging process to be repeated as many times as possible in succession<br>
-1-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
water-soiubie lubricants cons sang cf SyTfratic esters, silicone oils, graphite, extreme-pressure additives and surface active agents, have been typicaOy used as lubricants in aluminum alloy forging.<br>
It is difficult to satisfy the demands of hot aluminum forging by using conventional lubricants. With hot aluminum forging, the existing oil-soluble luoricants have disadvantages, such as flammability, causing smoking and/or workshop contamination, etc. in particular, many oil-soluble lubricants that contain graphite burn vi/hen the application temperature is greater than 300°C, such as is required for iiot forging of aluminum, causing unsafe working conditions and an increased risk of accidents. Furthermore, the existing water-soluble lubricants have disadvantage induding the requirement for treatment of waste water to control water pollution after use which results in cost inaeases, equipment investment and processing inefficiency.<br>
Many non-flammable additives have been unsuccessfully tested for use in hot forging. For example, haiogenated products have been tested, but they produce haiogenated<br>
 <br>
 <br>
3    general are not effective because they are not designed to work at temperatures above 300°C. Further, antimony and barium based products are generally not effective in hot forging applications.<br>
Conventional hot aluminum forging lubricants that best<br>
0    facilitate die movement typically include one or more organic lead compounds, such as lead naphthenate and lead stearate. The use of lead In lubricating compositions has come into disfavor because of the health hazards caused by the release of lead into the atmosphere. During the hot forging of aluminum<br>
5    some of the organic lead present in the lubricant is dispersed into the air in quantities which are unacceptable to most local and national governmental regulatory agendes. Such agencies have banned the use of lead in many industries and, where it is still allowed, severely limited the concentrations that may be<br>
&gt;o     discharged into the atmosphere. In order to continue using lead-containing lubricants, the hot forging industry would be required to install very expensive exhaust and air filtration<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
It would therefore be advantageous to provide a substantially lead-free lubricant for use in the aluminum and aluminum alloy hot forging in-dustry. Such lubricants provide superior lubrication properties and should not produce smoke or be flammable at temperatures at or above ZQO°Q.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a lubricant for use in hot forging or metal deformation of metals, especially aluminum and aluminum alloy components, titanium and superalloys. The<br>
i    lubricant comprises one or more oils, graphite, and one or more phosphorus-based additives. Additional additives, such as metallic lubricants, dispersants, thickeners and wetting agents may also be included. Tne lubricant of the present invention is substantially lead-free and does not bum when subjected to<br>
)    temperatures in excess of 300°C.<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCf^FTfOh 0? TnE iNYEKTION<br>
The present invenjc" csocses = 'i-c-CHnrfor use in noi-forging applications, suc^ as trosc utitizsd In forging aluminum and aluminum workpieces into t<e desired articles. such hot forging applications require lubricant materials that do not produce smoke or flame in the general temperature range of about to order comply with safety and health regulations lubri are substantially lead-free.></e>
The lubricant of the present invention Is an oil-based lubricant. The oil utilized may be virtually any composition known in the art, including but not limited to mineral oil, such as naphtenic, aliphatic, paraffinic or steam cylinder oil, vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, olive oil or rapeseed oil, animal oil, such as lard oil, synthetic oil, such as polyalphaolefins and silicone oil, semi-synthetic oil, such as glycerol trioleate and mixtures thereof. Preferred oils indude vegetable, mineral and animal oils. Such oils are commercially available as Process Oil 1000 from Texaco (UK), Lard oil from Wekti, Holm and Clark Co. (USA), Soybean oil from BG International (USA.).<br>
A second component of the lubricant is a graphite additive. The graphite may be in any form known in the art, including but not limited to coarse, fine, milled, unmilled, natural.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
graphite having a particle size distribution 'Aith about 90% of the particles below 15 microns In size is espedally preferred. Such graphite is connmercially available from Acheson Industries, Inc.<br>
One or more phosphorus-based additives are included in the lubricant. The phosphorus additive reduces and eliminates burning of the lubricant at high temperatures. The phosphorus can be in any desired form, such as phosphate, ester phosphate, phosphate amine, ammonium phosphate or mixtures thereof. One preferred phosphorous-based material is phosphate ester. Such phosphorous is commercially available from Connect Chemical (F), Ferro (USA).<br>
The hot forging lubricant composition optionally contains one or more metallic lubricating additives. The metallic additives may be chosen from one or more of the metallic elements, including tin, bismuth, zinc, aluminum or any alloys thereof.<br>
The lubricant composition may optionally contain additional ingredients such as dispersants, rheology modifiers, biocides, anticon'osives, extreme pressure additives, antifoam agents, wetting agents, metal soaps and mixtures thereof.<br>
