FIELD OF THE INVENTION		<br>
The invention relates generally to the storage and transport of natural gas and, more<br>
particularly, to the bulk storage of natural gas in a liquid medium or solvent and systems and<br>
methods for absorbing natural gas into a liquid or liquid vapor medium for storage and<br>
transport, and segregating back into a gas for delivery. The method of transport is by<br>
conventional road, rail, and ship modes utilizing the contained natural gas in concentrated<br>
form.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Natural gas is predominantly transported in gaseous, form by pipeline. For natural gas<br>
deposits not located in close proximity to a pipeline and, thus, not feasibly transported over a<br>
pipeline, i.e., stranded or remote natural gas, the gas must be transported by other means and is<br>
often transported in liquid form as liquid natural gas ("LNG") in ships. Natural gas storage and<br>
transport in liquid form involves a state at either cryogenic or near cryogenic temperatures ( -<br>
270 degrees F at atmospheric pressure to -180 degrees F at pressure), which requires a heavy<br>
investment in liquefaction and re-gasification facilities at each end of the non-pipeline transport<br>
leg, as well as heavy investment in large storage tankers. These capital costs along with high<br>
energy expenditures necessary to store and transport LNG at these states tend to make the<br>
storage and transportation of natural gas in liquid form quite costly.<br>
In recent years, transportation of stranded or remote natural gas assets as compressed<br>
natural gas ("CNG") has been proposed, but has been slow to commercialize. CNG, which<br>
includes compressing the gas at pressures of 100 to several hundred atmospheres, offers volumetric ratios of containment between one third and one half of the 600 to 1 (600 : 1) volumetric ratios obtained with LNG without the heavy investment in liquefaction and re-<br>
gasification facilities.<br>
The shipment of CNG at atmospheric temperatures or chilled conditions to -SO degrees<br>
F is presently the subject of industry proposals. Compressing natural gas to 2150 psig (146<br>
arm) places the gas compressibility (Z) factor at its lowest value, (approx 0.74 at 60 degrees F)<br>
before it climbs to higher values at elevated pressures. At 2150 psig a compressed volume ratio<br><br>
on the order of 225 : 1 is attainable. Commercial tankage at 3600 psig is commonly used to<br>
pack natural gas to a compressed volume ratio of 320 : 1.<br>
To effectively deliver stranded or remote natural gas into the shipping cycle it must be<br>
held in storage in quantities suited to the frequency of transport vessels and the production rate<br>
at the gas source. Loading, preferably achieved in a minimum amount of time, is also factored<br>
into this storage computation. Similarly, unloading must be into a storage system sized based<br>
on frequency of deliveries, unloading time and take away capacity of the pipeline feeding the<br>
natural gas to market. Holding a natural gas vessel at these staging points is part of the delivery<br>
costs associated with all transport modes.<br>
CNG handling is energy intensive requiring significant compression and cooling to<br>
these volumetric ratios, and then displacing the gas upon unloading. Given the relatively high<br>
cost of storing high pressure CNG, lengthy loading and unloading times and associated cooling<br>
or reheating capacity, no commercial system is yet operational to prove the possibility of<br>
conveying bulk volumes over 0.5 bcf/day.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide superior natural gas concentrations than<br>
those obtainable with CNG and at moderate pressures and moderately reduced temperatures to<br>
facilitate better performance parameters than CNG, and reduce the proportionate intensity of<br>
equipment required for LNG.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to natural gas or methane stored in a liquefied medium<br>
through the interaction of moderate pressure, low temperature and a solvent medium, and to<br>
systems and methods that facilitate the absorption of natural gas or methane into a liquid or<br>
liquid vapor medium for storage and transport, and back into a gas for delivery to market. The<br>
method of transport is preferably by conventional road, rail, and ship modes utilizing contained<br>
natural gas or methane in concentrated form. This method of gas storage and transportation is<br>
also adaptable for pipeline use.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the absorptive properties of ethane, propane and butane are<br>
utilized under moderate temperature and pressure conditions (associated with a novel mixing<br>
process) to store natural gas or methane at more efficient levels of compressed volume ratio<br>
than are attainable with natural gas alone under similar holding conditions. The mixture is<br>
preferably stored using pressures that are preferably no higher than about 2250 psig, and<br>
preferably in a range of about 1200 psig to about 2150 psig, and temperatures preferably in a<br><br>
range of about -20° to about -100° F, more preferably no lower than about -80° F and more<br>
preferably in a range of about -40° to -80° F. Natural gas or methane is combined at these<br>
moderate temperatures and pressures condition with a liquefied solvent such as ethane, propane<br>
or butane, or combinations thereof, at concentrations of ethane preferably at about 25% mol<br>
and preferably in the range of about 15 % mol to about 30% mol; propane preferably at about<br>
20% mol and preferably in a range of about 15% mol to about 25% mol; or butane preferably at<br>
about 15% and preferably in a range of about 10% mol to about 30% mol; or a combination of<br>
ethane, propane and/or butane, or propane and butane in a range of about 10% mol to about<br>
30% mol.<br>
The mixing process of the present invention efficiently combines natural gas or<br>
methane with a solvent medium such as liquid ethane, propane, butane, or other suitable fluid,<br>
to form a concentrated liquid or liquid vapor mixture suited for storage and transport. The<br>
solvent medium is preferably recycled in the conveyance vessel on unloading of the natural gas.<br>
Process conditions are preferably determined according to the limits of efficiency of the solvent<br>
used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the solvent is preferably pressure sprayed under controlled<br>
rates into a stream of natural gas or methane entering a mixing chamber. On meeting the<br>
absorption steam (solvent), the gas falls into the liquid phase gathering in the lower part of the<br>
mixing chamber as a saturated fluid mixture of gas and solvent, where it is then pumped to <br>
storage with minimal after cooling. Handling the gas in liquid form speeds up loading and<br>
unloading times and does not require after-cooling at levels associated with CNG.<br>
The gas is then segregated from the solvent for delivery to market. The gas is<br>
segregated from the solvent in a separator at an ideal temperature and pressure matching the<br>
required delivery condition. Temperature will vary based on solvent being used. The liquid<br>
solvent is recovered for future use.<br>
Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be or will<br>
become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and<br>
detailed description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, natural gas or methane is preferably absorbed<br>
and stored in a liquefied medium through the interaction of moderate pressure, low temperature<br>
and a solvent medium. In a preferred embodiment, the absorptive properties of ethane, propane<br>
and butane are utilized under moderate temperature and pressure conditions to store natural gas<br>
or methane at more efficient levels of compressed volume ratio than are attainable with natural<br>
gas or methane alone under similar holding conditions. A novel mixing process preferably<br>
combines natural gas or methane with a solvent medium such as liquid ethane, propane, butane,<br><br>
or other suitable fluid, to form a concentrated liquid or liquid vapor mixture suited for storage<br>
and transport. The solvent medium is preferably recycled in the conveyance vessel on<br>
unloading of the natural gas or methane.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an absorption fluid is preferably pressure sprayed under<br>
controlled rates into a steam of natural gas or methane entering a mixing chamber. The gas<br>
stream is preferably chilled to a mixing temperature by reduction of its pressure while flowing<br>
through a Joule Thompson valve assembly or other pressure reducing device, and/or flowing<br>
through a cooling device. On meeting the absorption fluid stream, the gas falls into the liquid<br>
solvent gathering in the lower part of the mixing chamber in the form of a saturate fluid. From<br>
the lower part of the mixing chamber the saturated fluid, a mixture of gas and liquid solvent, is<br>
pumped to storage with minimal after cooling. Handling the gas while absorbed in a liquid<br>
medium speeds up loading and unloading times and does not require after-cooling at levels<br>
associated with CNG.<br>
Turning in detail to the figures, a process flow diagram of the fill cycle is provided in<br>
Figure 1. As depicted, a stream of natural gas or methane is absorbed into a solvent to create a<br>
storage/ transport mixture in saturated fluid form. Depending upon the solvent used, different<br>
optimal temperature and pressure parameters will be required to attain the desired volumetric<br>
ratios of the gas within the solvent.<br>
In operation, the solvent is stored in a storage vessel 32 at a chilled temperature<br>
matching that of preferred gas storage conditions and solvent liquid phase maintenance<br>
conditions. Gas entering an inlet manifold 10 has its pressure raised via a gas compressor 12.<br>
The gas exiting the compressor 12 is then cooled to the same temperature as the stored solvent<br>
while passing through an air cooler/chiller train 14. The gas exiting the chiller train 14 is then<br>
fed at a controlled pressure governed by a pressure regulator 16 through a flow element 18 to a<br>
mixer or mixing chamber 20. The controlled pressure of the gas varies according to the gas<br>
mix being processed for storage and transport. The optimal storage conditions depend on the<br>
particular solvent used.<br>
The mixer 20 is also supplied with a solvent injected from a pump 30. The solvent flow<br>
rate is governed by a flow controller 34 and flow control valve 31. Information from the flow<br>
element 18 is fed to the flow controller 34 to match on a molar volume basis the desired<br>
solvent flow rate with that of the gas.<br><br>
Not shown in Figure 1 is the use of a Joule Thompson valve before the inlet manifold<br>
10. A Joule Thompson valve is preferably incorporated for very high well-head pressures<br>
requiring a drop in pressure to that of the procsss train. The pressure drop across the valve also<br>
creates a useable temperature drop in the gas stream.<br>
On meeting the solvent, the gas is absorbed and carried within a liquid phase medium.<br>
This liquid phase medium gathers in the lower part of the mixing chamber 20 with the solvent<br>
as a saturated fluid. The saturated fluid plus a small amount of excess gas is carried into a<br>
stabilizer vessel 40. Excess gas is cycled back through a pressure control valve 44 to the inlet<br>
manifold 10 for recycling through the mixer 20.<br>
The saturated fluid is then boosted in pressure to preferred storage levels by a packing<br>
pump 41 from which it is fed into a loading header 43 and then packed into holding tanks or<br>
storage vessels 42 fed by the loading header 43. Chilled blanket gas such as methane, ethane,<br>
propane, butane or mixtures thereof is preferably found in the tanks 42 prior to the tanks 42<br>
being filled with the saturated fluid. The blanket gas liquefies as the tanks 42 are filled with<br>
the saturated fluid. Tanks mounted on board a ship are preferably contained within a sealed<br>
enclosure filled with a blanket of chilled inert atmosphere. The stored saturated fluid is<br>
maintained at the appropriate temperature during storage and transit.<br>
Turning to Figure 2, a process flow diagram of a discharge/unloading cycle is provided<br>
where the saturated fluid stored in the holding tanks 42 is separated into a gas stream and<br>
stream of recovered solvent. The saturated fluid is fed from the tanks 42 through an unloading<br>
header 45 to a discharge pump 52 where it has its pressure raised sufficiently to pass through a<br>
heat exchanger 54. In the heat exchanger 54, the temperature of the saturated fluid is raised to<br>
obtain an optimal energy level for re-gasification. The re-gasified processed stream is then<br>
passed into a separator tower 56 where a drop in pressure causes the solvent to return to its<br>
liquid phase and separate from the gas. The gas stream exits the separator tower 56 and is<br>
delivered to storage or pipeline facilities through an outlet header 58, while the solvent from<br>
the lower part of the vessel is returned via a pressure control valve 62 to a storage vessel 60 for<br>
re-use.<br>
The systems and methods described in regard to Figs. 1 and 2 facilitate the absorption<br>
of natural gas into a liquid or liquid vapor medium for storage and transport, and the<br>
segregation of the gas for delivery to market and the retention of the solvent for reuse as a<br>
carrier medium. The process advantageously provides natural gas and methane volumetric<br><br>
ratios superior to those obtainable with CNG, enhanced performance parameters over those of a<br>
CNG operation and a reduction in the proportionate intensity of equipment required for LNG.<br>
The creation of the stored saturated fluid and subsequent reconstituted products for deliver is<br>
advantageously brought about with less energy expenditure than is involved in processing and<br>
reconstituting either CNG or LNG back to a pressurized gas at ambient temperature.<br>
Moreover, natural gas or methane retained in a liquid medium can advantageously be<br>
transferred by simply pumping, as compared to the compression, decompression and<br>
drawdown-compression stages involved in the transfer of CNG. As one skilled in the art would<br>
understand, this greatly improves on the economics associated with the storage and<br>
transportation of chilled CNG in current industry proposals.<br>
The reduction in costs relative to CNG handling is further related to the reduction in<br>
capital requirements for containment through the use of lighter, higher strength materials, often<br>
composite or fiber reinforced in nature. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the<br>
impact on a lower quantity of material for the lower operating pressures quoted above will<br>
further add to the economic viability of the invention.<br>
Unlike conventional processes (see, e.g., Teal USPN 5,513,054), the process of the<br>
present invention is not intended for the creation of a fuel mix, but rather for the storage and<br>
transport of natural gas (methane) with the solvent being recovered for reuse. The mixture<br>
advantageously allows for transport of the medium both in the liquid phase or within the liquid<br>
phase envelope of the gas mix.<br>
Process conditions are preferably determined according to limits of efficiency of each of<br>
the absorption fluids or solvents used. Turning to Figs. 3a-c, 4a-c, and 5a-c, the volumetric<br>
ratios of methane (C1) under a variety of pressure and temperature conditions and a variety of<br>
saturated fluid mixture concentrations of ethane (C2), propane (C3) and butane (C4) solvents is<br>
depicted. Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c illustrate that the volumetric ratio of methane (C1) is in a range of<br>
about one-third to one-half of LNG at pressures in a range of about 1200 psi to about 2100 psi<br>
for selected solvent concentrations and temperature conditions. The volumetric ratio of<br>
methane (C1), as depicted in Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c, is in a range of about one-third to one-half of<br>
LNG at temperatures in a range of about—30 to below —60F for selected solvent<br>
concentrations and pressure conditions. The volumetric ratio of methane (C1), as depicted in<br>
Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c, is in a range of about one-third to one-half of LNG at concentrations of<br>
ethane (C2) in a range of about 15% mol to about 25% mol, of propane (C2) in a range of about<br><br>
10% mol to about 30% mol, and of butane (C4) in a range of about 10% mol to about 30% mol<br>
for selected temperature and pressure conditions.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention obtains natural gas volumetric ratios in liquid form<br>
superior to those obtainable in CNG operations and, as a result, economics of scale, by using<br>
pressures that are preferably no higher than about 2250 psig, and preferably in a range of about<br>
1200 psig to about 2150 psig, and temperatures preferably in a range of about -20° F to about -<br>
100° F, more preferably no lower than about -80° F and more preferably in a range of about -<br>
40° F to -80° F. Natural gas or methane is combined with a solvent, preferably liquid ethane,<br>
propane or butane, or combinations thereof, at the following concentrations: ethane preferably<br>
at about 25% mol and preferably in the range of about 15 % mol to about 30% mol; propane<br>
preferably at about 20% mol and preferably in a range of about 15% mol to about 25% mol; or<br>
butane preferably at about 15% and preferably in a range of about 10% mol to about 30% mol;<br>
or a combination of ethane, propane and/or butane, or propane and butane in a range of about<br>
10%) mol to about 30% mol.<br>
Preferred packing and storage parameters and associated compression performance<br>
levels are provided below for stored liquid mediums utilizing ethane, propane or butane as the<br>
solvent (pure methane compression follows in parenthesis):<br>
Volumetric Ratio for Absorbed Natural Gas (vs. Compressed Natural Gas)<br>
A.	Ethane - 25% mol<br>
1200 psig -60 degree F	276 ft3/ft3 (203 ft3/ft3)<br>
1200 psig -40 degree F	226 ft3/ft3 (166ft3/ft3)<br>
1400 psig -40 degree F	253 ft3/ft3 (206 ft3/ft3)<br>
1500 psig -30 degree F	242 ft3/ft3 (207 ft3/ft3)<br>
B.	Propane - 20% mol<br>
1200 psig -40 degree F	275 ft3/ft3 (166ft3/ft3)<br>
1200 psig -30degreeF	236 ft3/ft3 (153 ft3/ft3)<br>
1400 psig -40 degree F	289 ft3/ft3 (206 ft3/ft3)<br>
1500 psig -30 degree F	279 ft3/ft3 (207 ft3/ft3)<br>
C.	Butane-15% mol<br>
1200 psig -60 degree F	269 ft3/ft3 (203 ft3/ft3)<br>
1400 psig -40 degree F	294 ft3/ft3 (206 ft3/ft3)<br>
1500 psig -40 degree F	301 ft3/ft3 (225 ft3/ft3)<br><br>
As the data in A, B and C above indicates, compression performance levels for the<br>
stored liquid medium at the noted moderate pressures and temperatures are competitive in all<br>
instances to CNG at 2100 psig and -60° F. Similar performance levels to A, B and C for<br>
compression ratios can be expected for pure methane: (1) at pressures in the 2100 psig range<br>
and temperatures of-30 to -20° F; and (2) at pressures in the 2500 psig range and temperatures<br>
of-10 to 0° F.<br>
The gas is preferably stored and transported within a liquid medium utilizing composite<br>
vessels and interconnecting hoses for low temperature application from ambient down to -100°<br>
F, and steel vessels for moderate temperature applications down to -40° F. The method of<br>
transport is by conventional road, rail, and ship modes utilizing the contained natural gas in<br>
concentrated form. The transportation vessel may be a custom design or adaptation of an<br>
existing form intended for land or marine use. Material specification of proven non exotic<br>
equipment is intended to be used in storage vessel design.<br>
Chilling during storage and transit can be any of a number of proven commercial<br>
systems presently available such as cascade propane. One of skill in the art would recognize<br>
that improvements in such equipment resulting in more efficient cooling to lower temperatures<br>
will result in improved compression performance in the present invention. (see Figs. 3a - 5c).<br>
De-pressuring, as required to recover the absorbent liquid and heating to re-vaporize the natural<br>
gas tends to require minimal energy by commencing at a pressure of only 1500 psig compared<br>
to the 3000 psig or higher expected in CNG systems. This also has a favorable impact on<br>
loading and unloading times.<br>
In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to<br>
specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and<br>
changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. For example, the reader is to understand that the specific ordering and combination<br>
of process actions shown in the process flow diagrams described herein is merely illustrative,<br>
unless otherwise stated, and the invention can be performed using different or additional<br>
process actions, or a different combination or ordering of process actions. As another example,<br>
each feature of one embodiment can be mixed and matched with other features shown in other<br>
embodiments. Features and processes known to those of ordinary skill may similarly be<br>
incorporated as desired. Additionally and obviously, features may be added or subtracted as<br><br>
