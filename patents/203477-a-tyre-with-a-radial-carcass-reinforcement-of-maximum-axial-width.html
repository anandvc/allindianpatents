COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"A TYRE WITH A RADIAL CARCASS REINFORCEMENT OF MAXIMUM<br>
AXIAL WIDTH"<br>
COMPAGNIE GENERALE DES ETABUSSEMENTS MICHELIN-MICHELIN &amp; CIE, a French company, 12, Cours Sablon, F-63040 Clermond-Ferrand, Cedex 09, France,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a tyre with a radial carcass reinforcement of maximum axial width.<br>
The present invention relates to a tyre with radial carcass reinforcement anchored on either side to at least one bead wire and having a crown reinforcement formed of at least two so-called working plies, superposed and made of wires or cables which are parallel in each ply and are crossed from one ply to the next, forming angles of at most 45" in absolute value with the circumferential direction of the tyre.<br>
It relates more particularly to a tyre of the "heavy vehicle" type, the ratio of the height above rim H to the maximum axial width S of which is at most 0.80, and which is intended to be fitted on a medium- or high-tonnage vehicle, such as a lorry, bus, trailer, etc.<br>
Some current tyres, called "highway" tyres, are intended to travel at high speed and on longer and longer journeys, owing to the improvement in the road network and the growth of the motorway network throughout the world.  All the conditions under which such a tyre is required to travel without doubt make it possible to increase the number of kilometres travelled, the wear of the tyre being less; on the other hand, the endurance of the latter and in particular of the crown reinforcement is adversely affected.<br>
French Patent 2,419,185 teaches that although the type of tyre in question, with a low H/S ratio, has numerous advantages, it also has a certain number of disadvantages, such as poor adhesion of the equatorial zone of the tread or localisation of high pressures in the region of the edges of the tread, which pressures are due to the shortening of the area of contact in the<br><br>
longitudinal direction of the tyre.  in order to overcome said disadvantages, the cited French Patent advocates arranging between the carcass reinforcement and the radially inner working ply, in two zones distant from the equatorial plane, two limiting blocks each formed of two superposed plies of inextensible cables, crossed from one ply to the other, forming opposed angles with the circumferential direction which are at most equal in absolute value to half the smallest angle used in the working plies, and other than 0°.<br>
The application of the solution set forth above, and the application thereof to a tyre of H/S form ratio of at most 0.80, in particular at most 0.6, intended to be fitted on a heavy vehicle, does not make it possible to obtain satisfactory endurance of the crown reinforce¬ment.<br>
The lack of endurance relates both to the fatigue resistance of the crown plies, and in particular the resistance to separation between ends of plies, and to the fatigue resistance of the cables of the portion of carcass reinforcement located beneath the crown reinforcement, the first deficiency being greatly influenced by the operating temperature at the edges of the working plies, whether travelling in a straight line or under drift.<br>
The object of French Application FR 2 728 510 is to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of a "heavy vehicle11 tyre, of a form ratio of at most 0.60, said reinforcement comprising at least two working crown plies of inextensible cables, crossed from one ply to the next, forming angles of between 10" and 45° with the circumferential direction, said plies having widths at least equal to 80% of the maximum axial width<br><br>
S0 of the carcass reinforcement.  It proposes arranging, firstly between the carcass reinforcement and the working ply radially closest to the axis of rotation, an axially continuous ply formed of inextensible metal cables forming with the circumferential direction an angle of at least 60° and the axial width of which is at least equal to the axial width of the shortest working crown ply, and, secondly between the two working crown plies, an additional ply formed of metallic elements oriented substantially parallel to the circumferential direction, the axial width of said ply being at least 0.7 S0, and the modulus of elasticity upon traction of which being at most equal to the modulus of the same name of the roost extensible working ply.<br>
Although the problems relating to the separation between working plies and the fatigue resistance of the carcass reinforcement cables would appear to be solved in one case, if the operating temperatures are greatly reduced in the other case, on the other hand prolonged travel of the tyres thus constructed causes fatigue failure of the cables of the additional ply, and more particularly of the edges of said ply, to occur, whether or not the so-called triangulation ply is present.<br>
It is always possible to change the reinforcement elements concerned, and in particular to select cables of a different construction or cables of greater tensile strength.  The solution above, while admittedly simple, is still costly.<br>
In order to overcome the above drawbacks and to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of the type of tyre in question, French Application FR 97/14011, which has not been published to date, has proposed a tyre<br><br>
with radial carcass reinforcement of maximum axial width S0, comprising a crown reinforcement formed of at least two working crown plies of inextensible reinforcement elements, crossed from one ply to the other, forming angles of between 10• and 45* with the circumferential direction, said plies having axial widths at least equal to 80% of the width S0, and, arranged radially between said working plies, an additional ply of reinforcement elements substantially parallel to the circumferential direction, said working plies having widths greater than the width of the additional ply by at least 16% of the width S0, and, on either side of the equatorial plane and in the immediate axial extension of the additional ply, being coupled over an axial distance at least equal to 3.5% of the width S0, then being decoupled by profiled members of rubber mix at least over the remainder of the width common to said two working plies.<br>
The choice of circumferential reinforcement elements for the additional ply of inextensible elements, such that the modulus of elasticity under traction of said additional ply is at most equal to the modulus of the same name of the most extensible working ply, and preferably low for a relative elongation of between 0% and 0.4%, and at most equal to the greatest modulus of elasticity upon traction of the most extensible working ply, for relative elongations greater than 0.4%, does not make it possible to obtain the best price/quality ratio, since the optimum fatigue strength of the circumferential elements requires a minimum density of the elements at the edges of the ply and a minimum tensile strength of said elements.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of the type of tyre in question, without being faced with problems of fatigue<br><br>
of reinforcement elements,  in the context of coupling the two working plies radially on either side of the additional ply of reinforcement elements, the solution consisting in selecting said elements as being circumferential has unexpectedly not proved to be the best solution.<br>
The tyre P according to the invention, with a radial carcass reinforcement of maximum axial width S0, comprising a crown reinforcement formed of at least two working crown plies of inextensible reinforcement elements, crossed from one ply to the other, forming angles of between 10° and 45° with the circumferential direction, said plies having axial widths L32, L34 at least equal to 80% of the width S0, and greater by at least 16% of the width SQ than the width L33 of an additional ply of reinforcement elements, arranged radially between said working plies, said working plies, on either side of the equatorial plane and in the immediate axial extension of the additional ply, being coupled over an axial distance 1 at least equal to 3.5% of the width S0, then being decoupled by profiled members of rubber mix at least over the remainder of the width common to said two working plies, is characterised in that the reinforcement elements of the additional ply are inextensible and substantially radial.<br>
The thickness of the decoupling profiled members between working plies, measured at the ends of the least wide working ply, will be at least equal to two millimetres, and preferably greater than 2.5 mm.<br>
"Coupled plies" is to be understood to mean plies, the respective reinforcement elements of which are separated radially by at most 1.5 mm, said thickness of rubber being measured radially between the upper and<br><br><br>
lower generatrices, respectively, of said reinforcement elements.  "Inextensible element" is to be understood to mean an element, whether cable or monofilament, which has a relative elongation of less than 0.2% when it is subjected to a tensile force equal to 10% of the breaking load.  In the case of the tyre in question, the inextensible reinforcement elements are preferably inextensible metal cables made of steel.<br>
Substantially radial reinforcement elements, whether wires or cables, are elements which form angles within the range of +85°, -85° around 0° with the circum¬ferential direction.<br>
The working plies generally are of unequal axial widths.  The radially outermost working ply may be less wide axially than the radially innermost working ply: it is then advantageous for the crown reinforcement to be finished off radially to the outside by an additional ply, referred to as a protective ply, of so-called elastic reinforcement elements, oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10° and 45° and of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the least wide working ply.  Said protective ply may have an axial width less than the axial width of the least wide working ply, but advantageously sufficient totally to cover the zone of coupling between the two working crown plies, and even more advantageously the tread of the tyre in question comprises a circumferential or quasi-circumferential groove axially arranged radially on the zone of coupling between the two working plies. Said protective ply may also have an axial width greater than the axial width of the least wide working ply, such that it covers the edges of the least wide working ply and such that it is coupled, in the axial extension of the additional ply, with the widest<br><br>
working crown ply over an axial distance equal to at least 2% of the width S0, then being decoupled, axially to the outside, from said widest working ply by profiled members of a thickness of at least 2 mm.  The protective ply formed of elastic reinforcement elements may, in the case referred to above, be firstly possibly decoupled from the edges of said least wide working ply by profiled members of a substantially lesser thickness than the thickness of the profiled members separating the edges of the two working plies, and secondly have an axial width less than or greater than the axial width of the widest crown ply.<br>
Whatever the solution described above, the crown reinforcement may be finished off, radially to the inside between the carcass reinforcement and the radially inner working ply closest to said carcass reinforcement, by a triangulation ply of inextensible reinforcement elements, forming with the circum¬ferential direction an angle greater than 60* and of the same direction as that of the angle formed by the reinforcement elements of the ply radially closest to the carcass reinforcement.  Said triangulation ply may have an axial width less than said widest working ply, which, in the crown reinforcement in question, is radially closest to the carcass reinforcement.  Said triangulation ply may also have an axial width greater than the width of the widest working ply, and it is then advantageous for the radially outer, so-called protective, ply coupled to the widest working ply, also to be coupled, in the immediate axial extension of the widest working ply, to said triangulation ply over an axial distance of at least 0.02 times the width S0 of the carcass reinforcement, then being decoupled, axially to the outside, from the edges of said triangulation ply by profiled members of a thickness of at least 2 mm.  The protective ply formed of elastic<br><br><br>
reinforcement elements may then be decoupled from the edges of said least wide working ply, as previously, by profiled members of a substantially lesser thickness than the thickness of the profiled members separating the edges of the two working plies.  Said protective ply may also be wider or less wide than the triangulation ply.<br>
The radially outermost working ply may be axially wider than the radially innermost working ply: it is then advantageous for the crown reinforcement to be completed, radially on the inside, by a triangulation ply of inextensible reinforcement elements forming with the circumferential direction an angle greater than 60° of the same direction of that of the angle of the reinforcement elements of the least wide ply (32).  The so-called triangulation ply may have an axial width which is less than the axial width of the least wide working ply, that is to say, the ply radially closest to the carcass reinforcement.  Preferably, said triangulation ply will have an axial width greater than the width of the least wide working ply and a width such that it is coupled, in the axial extension of the least wide working ply, to the widest working ply over an axial distance of at least 0.02 times the width SQ, then being decoupled from the edges of said ply by means of profiled members of rubber mix of a thickness of at least 2 mm, and that it is the triangulation ply or the widest working ply which has the greatest width.<br>
The crown reinforcements which have been described above, with the working ply radially farthest from the carcass reinforcement as being axially the widest, may also be completed, radially to the outside of said widest working ply, by a protective ply of elastic reinforcement elements, oriented at an angle of between 10° and 45° relative to the circumferential direction,<br><br>
of the same direction as that of the angle of the elements of the radially widest working ply.  Said protective ply may have an axial width which is less than the width of the least wide working ply, and may completely cover the zone of coupling between the two working crown plies.  It may also be wider than the least wide working ply, and less wide than the widest working ply, but will preferably have an axial width such that it radially covers the edges of the widest working ply, possibly being separated from said edges by profiled members of a thickness which may be less than the thickness of the profiled members separating the edges of the least wide working ply from the widest working ply, then, in the axial extension of the least wide working ply, being coupled with the radially inner triangulation ply formed of greatly inclined inextensible elements, over an axial width at least equal to 2% of the width S0, then decoupled from the edges of said triangulation ply by rubber profiled members of a thickness of at least 3 mm, whether it be the triangulation ply or the protective ply which is the widest.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood with reference to the following description, which refers to the drawings, illustrating in non-limitative manner examples of embodiment, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a first preferred variant of a crown reinforcement according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a second preferred variant according to the invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows a third variant in the same manner.<br><br>
in Figure 1, the tyre PA, of dimension 495/45 R 22.5 X, has an 'Height' to maximum axial width form ratio of 0.45. The 'Height' being the height of the tyre PA on its mounting rim. Said tyre PA comprises a radial carcass reinforcement (1) anchored in each bead to at least one bead wire, forming an upturn, and formed of a single ply of metal cables. This carcass reinforcement (1) is hooped by a crown reinforcement (3), formed radially from the inside to the outside<br>
by a first ply (31), referred to as a triangulation ply, formed of inextensible metal cables oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle equal to 65°,<br>
radially above and covering the preceding so-called triangulation ply, by a first working ply (32) formed of inextensible metal cables oriented by an angle equal to 18° and of the same direction as the angle of the elements of the triangulation ply,<br>
surmounting the first working ply (32), by an additional ply (33) formed of inextensible metal cables made of steel, said cables being oriented at 90° relative to the circumferential direction, the axially outer edges of said additional ply (33) being separated from the working crown ply (32) by layers of rubber of low thickness,<br>
then by a second working ply (34) formed of metal cables identical to those of the first working ply (32), and forming an angle of -18° i.e. opposed to the angle formed by the first working ply with respect to the circumferential direction,<br><br><br>
and finally by a final ply of so-called elastic cables, oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle of the same direction as the angle formed by said second working ply and equal to said angle (but possibly being different from said angle), this last ply being a protective ply.<br>
The axial width L32 of the first working ply (32) is equal to 0.87 times the maximum axial width So of the centre section of the carcass reinforcement (1), namely 416 mm, which, for a tyre of conventional shape, is substantially less than the width Li of the tread, which is equal in the case in question to 430 mm. The axial width L34 of the second working ply (34) is equal to 0.83 times the axial width So, or 400 mm. The triangulation ply (31) has an axial width L31 which is intermediate between the respective widths of the two working plies (32, 34) and in this case equal to 408 mm. As for the axial width L33 of the additional ply (33), it is equal to 320 mm. In actual fact, the width L33 of the additional ply (33) is less than the width L32 (L34) of the least wide working ply, while retaining a width sufficient to contribute effectively to the reduction in the operating temperatures of the tyre close to the ends of the working crown plies, which are the regions most adversely affected by the heating and the separations between plies. The final crown ply (35), referred to as a protective ply, has a width L35 which is substantially equal to 370 mm.<br>
The two working plies (32) and (34), on either side of the equatorial plane and axially in the extension of the additional ply (33), are coupled over an axial width 1, equal in this case to 17 mm: the cables of the first working ply (32) and the cables of the second working ply (34), over the axial width 1 of coupling of the two plies, are separated radially from each other by a layer of rubber, the<br><br>
thickness of which is minimal and which corresponds to twice the thickness of the rubber calendering layer of the hooped 27.23 metal cables of which each working ply (32, 34) is formed, i.e. 0.8 mm. Over the remaining width common to the two working plies, that is to say, about 20 mm on either side, the two working plies (32) and (34) are separated by a rubber profiled member (4) of substantially triangular shape, the thickness of said profiled member (4) increasing from the axial end of the coupling zone to the end of the least wide working ply, reaching a thickness of 4 mm at said end. Said profiled member (4) is of sufficient width to cover radially the end of the widest working ply (32) which, in this case, is the working ply radially closest to the carcass reinforcement. The tyre crown is complted by a tread (5) joined to the beads by two sidewalls (6) and the triangulation ply, radially adjacent to the carcass reinforcement (1) on either side of the equatorial plane, moves away therefrom axially towards the outside, said ply being joined to the carcass reinforcement (1) by means of triangular rubber profiled members (7).<br>
The tyre PB of Figure 2, of dimension 315/80 R 22.5 X, has an height to maximum axial width form ratio of 0.8. The 'Height' being the height of the tyre PB on its mounting rim. The architecture of the crown reinforcement (3) of said tyre PB differs from that described previously by the absence of a so-called triangulation ply. Thus the carcass reinforcement (1) anchored in each bead to at least one bead wire, forming an upturn, and formed of a single ply of metal cables, is hooped by a crown reinforcement (3), formed radially from the inside to the outside<br><br>
by a first working crown ply (32) formed of inextensible metal cables made of steel, oriented by an angle equal to 18°, radially adjacent and parallel to the carcass reinforcement (1) in its median part, the edges of which are separated from said carcass reinforcement by rubber profiled members (7) of a thickness which increases axially from the inside to the outside,<br>
surmounting the first working crown ply (32), by an additional ply (33) formed of inextensible tt metal cables made of steel, said cables being oriented at 90° relative to the circumferential direction, and the axially outer edges of said additional ply (33) of radial elements being separated from the first working crown ply (32) by layers of rubber of low thickness,<br>
then by a second working crown ply (34) formed of metal cables identical to those of the first ply (32), and forming an angle of -18° i.e. opposed to the angle formed by the first working ply with respect to the circumferential direction,<br>
and finally by a final ply (35) of so-called elastic metal cables, oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle of the same direction as the angle formed by said second working ply and equal to said angle (but possibly being different from said angle), this last ply being a protective ply.<br>
The protective ply (35) is surmounted radially by a tread (5) having four main circumferential grooves, the axially outermost grooves being located axially and<br><br>
radially above the zone of coupling of width 1 between the two working crown plies (32) and (34).<br>
The axial width L32 of the first working ply (32) is equal to 235 mm, which, for the tyre in question, is slightly less than the width of the tread, which is equal, in the case in question, to 235 mm. The axial width L34 of the second working ply (34) is slightly less than the width L32, since it is equal to 210 mm. The axial width L33 of the additional ply (33) is equal to 176 mm. The working plies (32) and (34), on either side and on both sides of the equatorial plane, in the extension of the additional ply (33), are coupled over a distance 1 of 9 mm, which represents a little less than 0.03 times the maximum axial width of the carcass reinforcement (1), with the same definition of coupling as in the previous case: minimal thickness between the cables of the plies and equal in the present case to 1 mm. Over the remaining width common to the two working plies, that is to say, about 6 mm on either side, the two working plies (32) and (34) are separated by a triangular rubber profiled member (4) having a thickness of 3.5 mm, measured at the end of the least wide working ply (34), the thickness of said profiled member increasing from the axial end of the coupling zone to the end of the least wide working ply. The crown reinforcement thus described is completed by a final ply (35) of so-called elastic steel cables, oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle of the same direction as the angle formed by a said second working ply and equal to said angle (but possibly being different therefrom), this latter ply (35) being a so-called protective ply, and elastic cables, as in the first example described, being cables having a relative elongation of at least 4% upon rupture. The axial width<br>
L35 of said ply (35) is substantially equal to<br><br>
198 mm, so as to cover the coupling zones between the two working plies (32) and (34).<br>
The examples described and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 relate to a single zone of coupling between plies. The tyre Pc shown in Figure 3, of the same dimensions as those of the tyre described in the first example, relates to two zones of coupling between plies.  The architecture of the crown reinforcement (3) of said tyre Pc differs from that of the tyre PA:<br>
firstly by the inversion of the axial widths of the two working plies (32) and (34),<br>
secondly by the modification of the widths of plies, working plies (32) and (34) and triangulation ply (31), the additional ply (33) retaining the same  width of 320 mm,   the width L32 of the radially inner working ply (32) becoming equal to 380 mm, the width L3/4 of the radially outer working ply (34) becoming equal to 451 mm, such that the triangulation ply (31) of width LJ1 equal to 431 mm is coupled, on either side of the equatorial plane, to the second working ply (34) in the axial extension of the first working ply (32) , over a width 12 substantially equal to 10 mm, the edges of said triangulation ply (31) then being decoupled from the widest working ply (34) by profiled members (4) of a width of 3.5 mm. Said preferred variant makes it possible, in particular, to improve the resistance to separation between the edges of working plies at the least wide ply (32).<br><br>

2.	A tyre as claimed in claim 1, wherein said profiled members (4) have a thickness of at least 2 mm at the ends of the least wide working ply (32, 34).<br>
3.	A tyre as claimed in claim 2, wherein said crown reinforcement (3), the working plies (32, 34) of which are of unequal axial widths, the radially outer working ply (34) being less wide axially than the radially inner working ply (32), also comprises, radially to the outside, a ply (35) of elastic reinforcement elements, oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10° and 45° and of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the least wide working ply (34), said protective ply (35) having an axial width L35 less than the axial width L34 of the least wide working ply (34).<br><br>
A tyre as claimed in claim 2, wherein said crown reinforcement (3), the working plies (32, 34) of which are of uneuqal axial widths, the radially outer working ply (34) being less wide axially than the radially inner working ply (32), also comprises, radially to the outside, a ply (35) of elastic reinforcement elements, oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10° and 45° and of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the least wide working ply (34), said ply (35) having an axial width L35 such that it radially covers the edges of the least wide working ply (34) and such that it is then coupled, in the axial extension of the additional ply, with the widest working crown ply (32) over an axial distance of at least 2% of the width So, then being separated, axially to the outside, from said widest working ply (32) by profiled members (4) of a thickness of at least 2 mm.<br>
A tyre as claimed in claim 4, wherein said protective ply (35) formed of elastic reinforcement elements is decoupled from the edges of said least wide working ply (32) by profiled members of a substantially lesser thickness than the thickness of the profiled members (4) separating the edges of the two working plies (32, 34).<br>
A tyre as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said crown reinforcement (3) has radially to the inside, between the carcass reinforcement (1) and the radially inner working ply (32), a ply (31) of inextensible reinforcement elements, forming with the circumferential direction an angle greater than 60° of the same direction as that of the angle of the reinforcement elements of the working ply (32), and of axial width L31 less than the axial width L32 of the widest working ply (32).<br>
A tyre as claimed in claim 5, wherein said crown reinforcement (3) is provided radially to the inside, between the carcass reinforcement (1) and the radially inner working ply (32), a ply (31)<br><br>
of inextensible reinforcement elements forming with the circumferential direciton an angle greater than 60°, of the same direction as the angle of the reinforcement elements of the working ply (32), and of axial width L31 greater than the width of the widest working ply, the protective ply (35) coupled to the widest working ply (32), having a width L35 such that it is also coupled, in the immediate axial extension of the widest working ply (32)t to said triangulation ply (31) over an axial distance 1" of at least 0.02 times the width So of the carcass reinforcement (1), than being decoupled, axially to the outside, from the edges of said triangulation ply (31) by profiled members (4) of a thickness of at least 2 mm.<br>
A tyre as claimed in claim 2, wherein said crown reinforcement (3), the working plies (32, 34) of which are of unequal axial widths, the radially outermost working ply (34) being wider axially than the radially innermost working ply (32), also comprises a ply (31) of extensible reinforcement elements, forming with the circumferential direction an angle greater than 60°, of the same direction as the angle of the reinforcement elements of the least wide ply (32), and the axial width L31 of which is less than the width L32 of the least wide ply (32).<br>
A tyre as claimed in claim 2, wherein said crown reinforcement (3), the working plies (32, 34) of which are of unequal axial widths, the radially outermost working ply (34) being wider axially than the radially innermost working ply (32), also comprises a triangulation ply (31) of inextensible direction an angle greater than 60° and of the same direction as the angle of the reinforcement elements of the least wide ply (32), and of a width L31 greater than the width L32 of the least wide working ply (32), the working ply (34) of greater width L34 being coupled, in the immediate extension of the working ply (32), with the triangulation ply (31) over an axial distance l1  of at least 0.02 times the width So of the carcass<br><br>
reinforcement (1), then being decoupled from the edges of said triangulation ply (31) by means of profiled members of rubber mix of a thickness of at least 2 mm.<br>
10.	A tyre as claimed in one of claims 8 or claims wherein said crown reinforcement (3) comprises, radially to the outside of the widest working ply (34), a protective ply (35) of elastic reinforcement elements, oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10° and 45° and of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the widest working ply (34).<br>
11.	A tyre as claimed in claim 10, wherein said crown reinforcement (3) comprises, radially to the outside of the widest working ply (34), a protective ply (35) of elastic reinforcement elements, oriented at an angle of between 10° and 45° relative to the circumferential direction, of the same direciton as that of the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the widest working ply (34), said ply (35) having an axial width L35 such that it radially covers the ends of the widest working ply (34) and, in the immediate extension of the least wide working ply (32), it is coupled with the radially inner ply (31) of greatly inclined inextensible elements, over an axial width I2 at least equal to 2% of the width So, then decoupled from the edges of said triangulation ply by rubber profiled members of a thickness of at least 3 mm.<br>
