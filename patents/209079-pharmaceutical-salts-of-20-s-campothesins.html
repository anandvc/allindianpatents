Anti-cancer activity:<br>
The compounds prepared in the present invention exhibited very good in vitro anti-cancer activity towards various human tumor cell lines.<br>
Each test compound was screened against a battery of cell lines representing eight different types of cancers. In a tj^icai procedure, 1 x 10  cells were seeded into<br><br>
each well of 96 well plate in 100|aL volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics and 10% FCS.<br>
The plates were incubated at 37°C in presence of CO2. After 24 h, test compounds were evaluated at five 10-fold dilutions ranging frorh 100 to 0.01µM. To each test well lOOµL of test compound solution was added and medium with vehicle was added to control wells and the plates were further incubated. After 48 h of incubation, plates were terminated by Sulforhodamine B method.<br>
The optical density, which is proportional to protein mass, is then read by automated spectrophotometric plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. Readings were transferred to a microcomputer and mean 50 % Growth Inhibition (GI50) and mean Total Growth Inhibition were calculated. The compounds of the present invention showed anticancer activity, which can be seen from the data given below:<br><br><br><br>
Solubility by HPLC method:<br>
Excess of compound was soaked in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 for 24h at room temperature. The solution was filtered through 0.45 micron PVDF syringe filter (Gelman Sciences). The filtrate was injected into HPLC at different volumes (10 &amp; 20 µ1). Chromatograms were recorded. Responses recorded were extrapolated from the calibration curve and the solubility of the compound was calculated. (J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 400).<br><br>
Male Swiss Albino Mice (20-30 g) were used in the experiments.   The animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions and had free access to feed and water ad libitum.    Before experimentation animals were fasted overnight     (-15 h) during which they had free access to water ad libitum. Dose preparation and administration:<br>
An amount equivalent to 10 mg of drug was weighed accurately and transferred into a clean mortar and triturated to obtain a fine powder. To this 500 µl of DMSO (10%) was added to obtain a clear solution. To this 4.5 ml of sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (sodium CMC) was added to make up the volume to 5 ml. Based on the animal weight appropriate volume (body weight in gramsxlO = no. of µl of dose to be given) of the prepared solution was administered through oral gavage. Animal experimentation:<br>
After dosing, at designated time points (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 12h) 100 (il of blood was collected from retro orbital plexus into 0.5 ml eppendorff tubes containing EDTA (5 µI of 200 mg/ml solution in Milli Q water). Blood was centrifuged at 12,800 rpm for<br><br>
■s<br>
2 mm and plasma was separated and immediately taken for analysis, without delay, in order to estimate both lactone and carboxylate forms of the compound. Bio-analysis procedure:<br>
50 µl plasma was transferred into a clean 2 ml micro centrifuge tube. To this ice cold methanol was added (450µl) and vertex mixed for 15 sec to extract the compound. These contents were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,800 rpm dry centrifuge tube. Clear supernatant was separated in to a 300 µl of auto sampler vial maintained at 4°C and 20 µl of this was injected into HPLC column. HPLC conditions:<br>
HPLC system (Shimadzu) consisted of system controller (SCL-IOAVP). Isocratic pump (LC-IOATVP), auto sampler (SIL-IOADVP), fluorescence detector (Rf-lOAXL) and column oven at 25°C (CTO-IOASVP) was controlled by Class-VP software. Sample was eluted through column (Supelcosil-LC318, 5µ, 4.6 x 250 mm. 300°A) with mobile phase [1% TEAA (pH = 5.5) : Acetonitrile : MeOH :: 80:15:5) pumped at 1.0 ml/min flow rate and eluent was detected using fluorescence detector set at Ex. 370 nm/Em. 537 nm.The approx, RTs were carboxylate (CAl-4.1 mm. CA2=4.8 mm) and lactone (LA1=7.9 mm, LA2=11.6 min). Calibration and determination of concentration:<br>
For the determination of drug concentration, peak area ratios of the drug to mtemal standard versus the concentration (range: 0.05 - 10 jig/ml) for both carboxyiate and lactone forms were plotted separately and linear regression was applied using software 'Sigma Plot" (Jandel Scientific version, 2.0, USA). Correlation coefficients (r2)of0.99 or better were obtained. Computation and Data Analysis:<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for both carboxylate and lactone forms separately by non-compartmental model analysis. The peak plasma concentration (Cma.x) and the corresponding time (Tmax) were directly obtained from the raw data. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve up to the last quantifiable time point, AUC,o-t&gt; was obtained by the linear and log-linear trapezoidal summation. The AUCfO-t) extrapolated to infinity (i.e., AUC (o-Qo) by adding the quotient of Clasr/Keu<br><br>
where Clast represents the last measurable time concentration and Kei represents the apparent terminal rate constant. Kei was calculated by the linear regression of the log-transformed concentrations of the drug in the terminal phase. The half-life of the termmal elimination phase was obtained using the relationship ty, = 0.693/ Ke).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
