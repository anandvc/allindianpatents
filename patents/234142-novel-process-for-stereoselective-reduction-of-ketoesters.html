TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
Novel process for stereoselective reduction of P-ketoesters<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel stereoselective process for preparing optically active dihydroxy ester derivatives of formula I which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of HMG-CoA enzyme inhibitors like atorvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, itavastatin, fluvastatin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Esters derivatives of the formula I<br><br>
R1 = CN, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryi or hetroaryl R2 = Alkyl oraryl<br>
Formula I<br>
are valuable chiral synthons for synthesizing compounds which are known anti-hyptercholesterolemic agents having an inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase (Ref. US 5003080, US 5169857, WO 01 85702, US 5354772, EP 0304063)<br>
The most common approach for achieving stereoselective synthesis of compounds of formula I is the reduction of formula II<br><br>
R, = CN, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryl or hetroaryl<br>
R2 = Alkyl or aryl Formula II<br><br>
using special borane reagents (ref. US 5273995, US 5470981, US 5489691). Reagents such as methoxydiethylborane are hazardous and expensive.<br>
US 6001615 describe an enzymatic route of synthesis. This process, however, suffers from the fact that the process is not industrially scalable and also involves large volumes.<br>
US 5399722 describe a process starting from commercially available ethyl-© -chloroacetoacetate or its benzyloxy derivative. The disadvantages of tins process is that a stereoselective reduction using a ruthenium-BlNAP catalyst in employed and the desired compound of formula I is obtained in six steps.<br>
US 5481009 describe a process starting from 4-phenyl-3-butenoic acid in about 5 steps. The process uses hazardous steps (ozonolysis) to obtain the desired product.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a simple, industrially scalable process for the stereoselective reduction of compounds of formula n, leading to preparation of compounds of formula I employing inexpensive and non-hazardous reagents.<br>
The use of compounds of Formula I in synthesis of statins are illustrated in Schemes 1-6.<br>
The present invention has following advantages over known method:<br>
1.	Safe and non-hazardous<br>
2.	Cost-effective<br>
3.	Industrially scalable<br>
4.	Lesser number of steps<br>
5.	Commercially viable<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention details a novel process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br><br>
R1 = CH, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryl or hetroaryl R2 = Alkyl or aryl<br>
Formula I by reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
R, = CN, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryl or hetroaryl R2 = Alkyl or aryl Formula II<br>
with sodium borohydride in presence of metal halides, preferably CeCU or metal alkoxides, preferably Ti(OiPr)4 (Scheme I). The reagents used are non-hazardous, easily available and cheap.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention<br>
The compound of formula II is an important intermediate for the preparation of many drug molecules especially, HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors. The HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors are useful as inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) and are thus useful as hypolipidemic or hypocholesterolemic agents.<br><br>
The process of the present invention in its first aspect is a new, improved, non-hazardous, industrially scalable, economical, and commercially feasible method for preparing intermediates used for the preparation of HMG.C0A reductase inhibitors. The process of the present invention in its first aspect is outlined in Scheme I.<br>
The present invention details a novel process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br><br>
R1 = CN, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryi or hetroaryl R2 = Alkyl or aryl<br>
Formula I by reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
R1 = CN, OP (P=any suitable protecting group), alkyl, aryl or hetroaryl R2 = Alkyl or aryl Formula II<br><br>
with<br>
1)	sodium borohydride in presence of metal halides, preferably anhydrous CeCl3 or<br>
2)	hydrated CeCl3 or<br>
3)	metal alkoxides, preferably Ti(OiPr)4<br>
The reagents used are non-hazardous, easily available and economic.<br>
The compound of formula I arc important intermediates for Hxc<br>
preparation of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors as shown in scheme 2 (Atorvastatin), scheme 3 (Cerivastatin), scheme 4 (Etavastatin), scheme 5 (Rosuvastatin) and scheme 6 (Fluvastatin).<br>
