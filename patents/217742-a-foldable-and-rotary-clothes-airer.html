				<td>This invention relates to a foldable and rotary clothes airer for use for drying clothes.<br>
The clothes are dried by lying the same on the ground or on the stable frame or on the branches of the tree or on any other suitable structure on which the clothes can be hanged.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with such process/articles used for drying clothes. One of the main disadvantage associated with the prior art is that the person has to go to place to place and structure to structure for hanging the clothes thereon.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the person who is drying the clothes has to go to the stable stand or to each and every branch on which he wants to hang the clothes and thus it is a tirying job.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a foldable arid rotatable clothes airer for use for drying clothes.<br>
Another object is that the user can hang the clothes on all arms of the clothes airer by rotating the same and therefore the user has not to go to each and every arms for hanging the clothes.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a foldable and rotatable clothes airer which can be folded and therefore transportation of the same is very easy.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a foldable and rotary clothes airer characterized in that a central support for supporting a plurality of arms thereon, an upper and lower brackets being provided for supporting said arms pivotally on the said central support, the lower ends of said arms secured pivotally with the lower bracket being provided for hanging the clothes thereon, support arms pivotally secured with the upper bracket being secured to the middle portion of said arms for keeping said arms in the horizontal position, stop rings are provided at the upper end of said central support for holding the upper bracket rotatably there between, a small support arms secured with said upper bracket being provided for holding the lower bracket near the upper bracket to keep said arms in the horizontal position during the use of the clothes airer, a stop rivet being provided in the said central support below the upper bracket to stop the movement of said lower bracket towards the upper bracket.<br>
In accordance with this invention the clothes airer has a central support for supporting a plurality of arms thereon with the help of an upper and lower brackets. The lower ends of the arms are pivotally secured with the lower bracket. The supporting arms pivotally secured to the upper bracket are pivotally secured to the center of the arms for keeping the arms in the horizontal position during the use of the clothes airer. A small support arm is secured with the upper bracket for holding the lower bracket near the upper bracket during the use of the clothes airer. Holding rings are provided at the top end of the central support for holding the upper bracket rotatably there between A stop rivet is provided in the central support at a distance below the upper bracket to stop the upward movement of the lower bracket. The lower end of the central support is adapted to be, fitted in the upper end of another central support rotatably. The lower end of the other central support having a slot therein is adapted to be fitted in a base support which is grounded or fixed in a grounded structure.<br>
A foldable and rotary clothes airer according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig.1        shows  the  clothes airer  in  the  folded position;<br>
Fig.2        shows  the clothes airer in  the  unfolded position and;<br>
Fig.3        shows the top plan  view  of the upper and lower brackets.<br>
Referring  to the drawings the  clothes airer<br>
has  a central support (1) for supporting the  arms  (2)<br>
thereon.    An upper bracket (3) and lower  bracket  (4)<br>
are provided for supporting the arms (2) on the  central<br>
support  (1).   The  lower ends  of  the  arms  (2)  are<br>
pivotally  secured  with  the lower  bracket  (4).   The<br>
support  arms  (5)  pivotally   secured   to  the  upper<br>
bracket  (3) are pivotally secured with the? arms (2)  in<br>
the;  middle thereof.  A small support arms  (6)  secured<br>
with  the upper bracket (3) is provided for holding  the<br>
lower bracket (4) near the upper bracket (3) to keep the<br>
arms  (2) in the horizontal position during the  use  of<br>
the clothes airer. A stop rivet (7) is provided with the<br>
central support (1) below the upper bracket (3) to  stop<br>
the movement of the lower bracket (4) towards the  upper<br>
bracket (3) during the use of the clothes airer. Stop rings (8) and (9) are provided at the upper end of the central support (1) for holding the upper bracket (3)<br>
rotatably  therebetween.   The  lower end  (10)  of  the<br><br>
central support (1) having lesser diameter is adapted to he  fitted into a small central support (11)  rotatably. The  small  central support (i.l) having a slot  (12)  is adapted  to be fitted into a base support (13) having  a rivet  (14) therein to be fitted in the slot 12  of  the small central support (11) so as to stop the  rotational movement   of the small central support (11).  The  base support  (13) is adapted to be grounded or to  be  fixed with  a  grounded  structure. A  plastic  tube  (15)  is provided  at the lower end (10) of the  central  support (1)  to stop the bear and tear of the lower end (10)  of the  central  support  (1) during the  rotation  of  the central support (1).<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1.	A  foldable   and  rotary  clothes  airer  having  a  central  support  for supporting a plurality of arms thereon, an upper and lower brackets being provided for supporting said arms pivotally on the said central support, the lower ends of said arms secured pivotally with the lower bracket being provided for hanging the clothes thereon, support arms pivotally secured with the upper bracket being secured to the middle portion of said arms for keeping said arms in the horizontal position, stop rings are provided at the upper end of said central support for holding the upper bracket rotatably there between, a small support arms secured with said upper bracket being provided for holding the lower bracket near the upper bracket to keep said arms in the horizontal position during the use of the clothes airer, a stop rivet being provided in the said central support below the upper bracket to stop the movement of said lower bracket towards the upper bracket.<br>
2.	A clothes airer as claimed in claim  1 wherein the lower end of said<br>
central support is of smaller diameter so as to fitted in the upper end of<br>
