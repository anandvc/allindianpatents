3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
ENGLISH TRANSLATION VERIFICATION CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br><br>
AGENT FOR OMYA DEVELOPMENT AG<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant OMYA DEVELOPMENT AG do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/IB2007/000076 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br>
The first object of the present invention consists of a process of preparation of at least one mineral matter and/or at least one pigment, including a natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate, preferentially natural, made at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, and including the stages of:<br>
a)	supplying at least one mineral matter and/or at least one pigment containing natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate, in a dry form or in the form of an aqueous dispersion and/or suspension,<br>
b)	possibly dry grinding and/or grinding in an aqueous medium the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a),<br>
c)	treating the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a) and/or from stage b),<br>
d)	possibly drying the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a) and/or b) and/or c),<br>
characterised in that:<br>
-	treatment stage c) corresponds to a stage of blending in an aqueous medium and/or of grinding in an aqueous medium, and/or of concentration in an aqueous medium, of the mineral matter and/or the pigment obtained from stage a) and/or from stage b), in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid,<br>
-	a dispersing agent and/or grinding aid agent is introduced before and/or during the treatment stage c).<br>
A second object of the present invention lies in the aqueous suspensions and dispersions obtained by the said process.<br>
A third object of the present invention lies in the dry products obtained by the said process.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention lies in the use of the said aqueous suspensions and the said aqueous dispersions and the said dry products in the manufacture of plastics, paints and papers, and notably in plastic or paper coatings, and also in plastic or paper mass fillings.<br>
The aim of the process is essentially the processing and/or economic production of a mineral matter and/or a pigment including a natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
The process according to the invention notably enables the skilled man in the art to obtain a dispersion of mineral matter and/or of pigment treated in this manner with a high dry extract (an expression which will be repeated throughout the present Application, and defined as the percentage by dry weight of mineral matter and/or of pigment relative to the total weight of the said dispersion).<br>
A high dry extract, and notably one greater than 65%, preferentially 70%, very preferentially greater than 75%, of the total weight of the said dispersion leads to a reduction of the costs of transport of such a dispersion, and to a reduction of the drying costs of such a dispersion.<br>
The process according to the invention notably enables such dry extracts to be obtained, whilst retaining for the said dispersion advantageous rheological properties, since the said dispersion remains easily able to be handled, and which prevents the significant presence of agglomerates.<br>
2<br><br>
A second aim is to give the skilled man in the art the possibility of treating the mineral matter and/or the pigment containing a natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate to make it at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, both during a grinding stage, and during a blending stage, and during a concentration stage, which are the stages traditionally implemented during the overall process of manufacture of an aqueous dispersion of mineral matter: these different possibilities all constitute flexibility made available to the skilled man in the art.<br>
A calcium carbonate made organophilic in this manner may be used advantageously in the plastics field; furthermore, its hydrophilic character will enable it to be dispersed at high concentration in water, i.e. aqueous dispersions or suspensions of calcium carbonate to be obtained of which the dry weight content of mineral matter will notably be greater than 65% of their total weight, whilst having advantageous rheological properties without the formation of agglomerates.<br>
In plastics, such as notably thermoplastic resins or thermosetting resins, mineral matter and/or pigments are commonly incorporated, such as, for example, natural or precipitated calcium carbonate, the dolomites, magnesium hydroxide, kaolin, talc, gypsum, or again titanium dioxide. This mineral matter and/or these pigments can improve particular properties of these plastics, such as, in the case of the use of calcium carbonate in PVC, increased rigidity, improved thermal exchanges during extrusion, or again reduced deposit on die-removal. The Applicant may in this respect quote the document "The use of calcium carbonate to enhance the physical properties of rigid vinyl products" (Society of Plastic Engineers, Conf., 12-14 October 1999). Furthermore, it is also common to replace part of the plastic resins, which are expensive materials, by these pigments and/or this mineral matter.<br>
In connection with the use of calcium carbonate in plastics, the skilled man in the art - who is a manufacturer of mineral matter notably with a view to its use in plastics - knows that in order to improve the compatibility of the said carbonate with the plastic in which it is incorporated it is necessary to treat the calcium carbonate. In relation thereto, it has been known for many years to use derivatives of fatty acids as a treatment agent of calcium carbonate, since these fatty acids notably have 10 to 20 carbon atoms, and more specifically 16 to 18 carbon atoms, in a saturated carbon structure (such as stearic acid), palmitic acid and/or stearic acid and their salts, which are the agent or agents preferentially used by the skilled man in the art.<br>
It is important to indicate that the calcium carbonate is prepared according to various stages of manufacture in an aqueous medium, such as stages of dispersion, grinding or again concentration. The product resulting from the stages is an aqueous dispersion or suspension of calcium carbonate, possibly containing different dispersing agents and/or grinding aid agents and/or treatment agents introduced in the course of these different stages.<br>
Generally, when stearic acid is added (either in the molten state, or in the form of an emulsion) into a dispersion or suspension of calcium carbonate, or to dry calcium carbonate, an additional stage of disaggregation must be undertaken following this addition.<br>
In the case of the use of an emulsion of stearic acid, in which an emulsifier may be introduced in order to stabilise this emulsion, the presence of the emulsifier may cause the destabilisation of the dispersion or of the suspension of calcium carbonate, which leads to the formation of<br>
3<br><br>
flocculated particles and/or floating particles. This emulsifier has the additional drawback that it causes foam to be created in the dispersion or the suspension.<br>
This brings up a first drawback relating to the use of stearic acid: it requires the addition of additional stages and/or additives, sometimes with negative consequences during the treatment process.<br>
Nor does selecting a treatment undertaken with salts of stearic acid, as neutralised with calcium ions, lead to the solution sought by the skilled man in the art: it also has the drawback of leading to the creation of foam in the dispersion or suspension of calcium carbonate.<br>
Finally, it appears that the use of stearic acid or of its salts does not enable aqueous suspensions or dispersions of calcium carbonate to be obtained having a concentration by weight of dry mineral matter greater than 65% of the total weight of the said dispersion or suspension with a usable viscosity and/or without the creation of agglomerates which lead to the presence of residues retrieved on the filtration screens. And calcium carbonate is commonly manufactured according to the previously described stages, transported in the form of an aqueous dispersion or suspension, possibly stored in this same form, and finally dried before being incorporated in the plastic. For economic reasons, it is essential for the skilled man in the art to manufacture and deliver to the end transformer an aqueous dispersion or suspension of calcium carbonate having as high as possible a dry extract, whilst maintaining a satisfactory viscosity and/or without significant creation of agglomerates, and thus residues retrieved on the screen, which the use of stearic acid or its salts does not permit.<br>
Seeking to resolve these different drawbacks relating to the use of stearic acid or of its salts, in order to treat, so as to make it at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, a mineral matter (and notably calcium carbonate) with a view to its incorporation in plastics and with a view to manufacturing it economically, the Applicant has developed a new process for preparation of at least one mineral matter and/or at least one pigment including natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate which is at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, and comprising the stages of:<br>
a)	supplying at least one mineral matter and/or one pigment containing natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate, in a dry form or in the form of a dispersion and/or an aqueous suspension,<br>
b)	possibly dry grinding and/or grinding in an aqueous medium the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a),<br>
c)	treating the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a) and/or from stage b),<br>
d)	possibly drying the mineral matter and/or the pigment resulting from stage a) and/or b) and/or c),<br>
characterised in that:<br>
- treatment stage c) corresponds to a stage of blending in an aqueous medium and/or of grinding in an aqueous medium, and/or of concentration in an aqueous medium, of the mineral matter and/or the pigment obtained from stage a) and/or from stage b), in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid,<br>
4<br><br>
a dispersing agent and/or grinding aid agent is introduced before and/or during the treatment stage c).<br>
Such a process therefore enables, in a very surprising manner, the treatment agent to be incorporated in order to manufacture suspensions of natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate with dry extracts higher than those obtained by the processes of the prior art using stearic acid or its salts, whilst maintaining a satisfactory viscosity and/or without the significant creation of agglomerates and thus residues retrieved on the screen, and without the drawbacks of this prior art.<br>
It is notably very surprising that, if the salts of ethylene acrylic acid are added during or after the addition of dispersing agent, its salts do not influence in a negative fashion the rheological properties of the dispersions obtained: indeed, one succeeds surprisingly, using the process according to the invention, in obtaining high dry extracts (notably greater than 65%) with satisfactory rheological properties and without the formation of agglomerates.<br>
At the same time, it is very surprising that the dispersing agent (which is added before or during the introduction of the ethylene acrylic acid salts) does not prevent the interaction between the said salts and the surface of the calcium carbonate in order to make it organophilic: indeed, one succeeds surprisingly, using the process according to the invention, in manufacturing calcium carbonate particles which are dispersible in plastics.<br>
The Applicant wishes to indicate that there are a number of documents relating to the use of ethylene acrylic acid in a process of manufacture of calcium carbonate. On this subject, he wishes to emphasise:<br>
-	firstly, that none of these documents seeks to resolve the same technical problem as that of the present Application,<br>
-	moreover, that none of these documents reveals the technical solution of the present Application, which consists in the process described above,<br>
-	in addition, that nothing suggested in one of these documents, or in possible combinations of one or more of these documents mutually or with other documents, the process according to the invention; and that on the contrary the teaching of these documents could not lead the skilled man in the art to the process forming the subject of the present invention.<br>
These arguments will now be developed with regard to the content and the teaching revealed by each of the documents relating to the use of ethylene acrylic acid in the course of a process of manufacture of calcium carbonate.<br>
The skilled man in the art is familiar with document US 6 808 809 which seeks to resolve the technical problem of manufacturing a mineral filler notably having good flowability; in relation thereto, this document does not in any way resolve the same technical problem as that forming the subject of the present Application. The solution which it proposes consists in introducing into a dryer an aqueous suspension of mineral filler (such as calcium carbonate) having an average diameter of less than 15 µm, and an aqueous dispersion of a polymer (such as notably ethylene acrylic acid). This document indicates that the suspension of mineral filler may have a dry extract of between 10% and 90% of the total weight of the said suspension; however, only example 1 produced in the case of aluminium trihydroxide reveals a dry<br>
5<br><br>
extract value, equal only to 55%. Nothing is, moreover, indicated concerning the viscosity of the suspensions obtained, nor concerning the possibility of reducing the quantity of agglomerates of mineral matter. The Applicant stresses that in no case does this document reveal the use of ethylene acrylic acid in the form of salts, which therefore constitutes an element of distinction with the present invention. Finally, nothing suggests to the skilled man in the art that he should attach particular importance to the use of a dispersing agent in this document, and all the more so to the use of a dispersing agent before the use of ethylene acrylic acid in the form of salts; similarly, nothing suggests in this document - centred around a drying process - a process according to the invention which offers the possibility of treating a calcium carbonate both during a grinding stage and a blending and concentration stage, in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid, and of a dispersing agent or grinding aid agent used before the stage of treatment of calcium carbonate.<br>
The skilled man in the art is also familiar with document WO 93/11183 which seeks to resolve the technical problem of improving the dispersion of inorganic particles in different materials, such as paints, adhesives, putties, or again binders for non-woven materials; this is therefore a technical problem different to the one resolved by the present Application, since it does not address notably the question of manufacturing suspensions of mineral matter having a high dry extract. The described solution consists of a process of preparation of a stable aqueous dispersion, by the blending of an aqueous suspension of inorganic particles (such as calcium carbonate) and of an aqueous suspension of polymeric latex particles, after having adjusted their zeta potentials. The ethylene acrylic acid is described as one of the polymers which can be used, without it ever been exemplified, and without it ever being particularly distinguished among all the usable polymers. In addition, the examples demonstrate that the resulting suspensions have low dry extracts, always less than 60% by dry weight of mineral particles relative to the total weight of the said suspensions. A fundamental element of distinction with the present invention is that this document never mentions the presence of salts of ethylene acrylic acid. Finally, nothing suggests to the skilled man in the art that he should attach particular importance to the use of a dispersing agent in this document, and all the more so to the use of a dispersing agent before the use of ethylene acrylic acid in the form of salts; similarly, nothing suggests in this document - centred around a blending process - a process according to the invention which offers the possibility of treating a calcium carbonate both during a grinding stage and a blending and concentration stage, in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid, and of a dispersing agent or grinding aid agent used before the stage of treatment of calcium carbonate.<br>
The skilled man in the art is also familiar with document WO 97/13815 which seeks to resolve the technical problem of manufacturing powders compatible with plastics (but also paints and paper), of preventing the coalescence of the particles which constitute such powders, of making the surface of the calcium carbonate hydrophobic; as such, this document resolves only partially the problem forming the subject of the present Application. Indeed, the solution which it proposes does not enable aqueous suspensions of calcium carbonate to be obtained with a dry extract greater than 65% relative to the total weight of the said suspensions, as is notably demonstrated by the results of table 2 on page 29. In addition, the proposed solution consists in dissolving, initially, a polymer (such as ethylene acrylic acid) in a medium containing carboxylic acid, and then in bringing the product obtained into contact with calcium carbonate in such a way as to cause it to precipitate on the latter: this stage of the solution constitutes a fundamental element of differentiation with the present invention. In addition, this stage of dissolution, when it uses long-chain carboxylic acids, will lead to the<br>
6<br><br>
same problems as those resulting from the use of stearic acid, namely the need for an additional stage of disagglomeration and/or addition of additional additives of calcium carbonate particles. This same stage of dissolution, when it uses carboxylic acids with shorter chains, will lead to the flocculation of the calcium carbonate particles, and will not therefore enable aqueous suspensions with a high dry extract, and notably greater than 65% of the total weight of the said suspensions, to be obtained. These carboxylic acids with shorter chains can also destroy the calcium carbonate particles, and even generate carbon dioxide. Finally, these short-chain carboxylic acids can reduce the resistivity and increase the conductivity of the plastics in which the calcium carbonates according to the invention are finally used. Finally, nothing suggests to the skilled man in the art that he should attach particular importance to the use of a dispersing agent in this document, and all the more so to the use of a dispersing agent before the use of ethylene acrylic acid in the form of salts; similarly, nothing suggests in this document - centred around a blending process - a process according to the invention which offers the possibility of treating a calcium carbonate both during a grinding stage and a blending and concentration stage, in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid, and of a dispersing agent or grinding aid agent used before the stage of treatment of calcium carbonate.<br>
The skilled man in the art is also familiar with document WO 02/96982 which seeks to resolve the technical problem of manufacturing a organic-inorganic nano-composite material, whilst strengthening within this said material the compatibility between the organic particles and the inorganic particles; as such, this document does not resolve the same technical problem as that forming the subject of the present Application. The solution which it proposes consists in forming a blend between a mineral particle (such as calcium carbonate) and a polymer solution (such as, for example, one with an ethylene acrylic acid base) in the presence of solvents, in evaporating the solvents, and in blending the product obtained with a polymer resin. This document gives no indication concerning the dry extracts of the blends of mineral particles and polymers. Furthermore, it has the drawback of using solvents (such as notably THF and ethanol), the presence of which is undesirable for the skilled man in the art, notably because they will engender a high rate of volatile organic carbon (VOC) in the atmosphere. Finally, this process is different from that forming the subject of the present invention, since it does not mention the presence of a dispersing agent. Finally, nothing suggests in this document - which is centred around a blending process - a process according to the invention which offers the possibility of treating calcium carbonate both during a grinding stage and during a blending or concentration stage, in the presence of at least one salt of ethylene acrylic acid, and one dispersing agent or grinding aid agent used before the stage of treatment of calcium carbonate.<br>
The skilled man in the art is also familiar with document US 5 449 402 which seeks to resolve the technical problem of binding irreversibly a mineral filler and an organic modifier, which are then used in the composition of aqueous linings, the opacity and brightness of which are improved; as such, this document absolutely does not resolve the same technical problem as the one forming the subject of the present Application. The solution which it proposes consists in manufacturing a pigment from calcium carbonate particles in the flocculated state and from an anionic modifying agent (such as polymers, and notably ethylene acrylic acid), in which the calcium carbonate and the modifying agent are then bound to one another by electrostatic links. The general teaching this document is that, in order to treat a calcium carbonate notably with a solution of ethylene acrylic acid, it is preferable to have initially one pigment in a flocculated form (column 4, lines 39 to 62), and<br>
7<br><br>
not a dispersed pigment (as indicated explicitly on line 50 of column 4), where this dispersed state is defined as resulting from the addition of an agent having led to a reduction of the viscosity or to a reduction of the sizes of the particles (column 1, lines 15 to 25). A dispersing agent such as sodium polyacrylate can subsequently be added after the introduction of the solution of ethylene acrylic acid (column 4, lines 63 to 65). Consequently, the skilled man in the art is strongly encouraged not to use a dispersing agent before the treatment of the calcium carbonate by a solution of ethylene acrylic acid. This dispersed state, as defined in document US 5 449 402 as resulting from the addition of an agent leading to a reduction of viscosity or to a reduction of the size of the particles, is therefore undesired in this document; however, it forms part of one of the fundamental characteristics of the present invention. Finally, the Applicant was able to observe that, in a surprising manner since it was completely contrary to the teaching of the prior art, the introduction of a dispersing agent necessarily before or during the addition of salts of ethylene acrylic acid to treat the calcium carbonate, enables by this means the calcium carbonate to be made at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, without using stearic acid, enables aqueous suspensions to be obtained with a high dry extract and a satisfactory rheology and without agglomerates, and enables the skilled man in the art to be given a very flexible process, since the ethylene acrylic acid can be used either during a stage of grinding, or of blending, or of concentration.<br>
Therefore, none of the documents available to the skilled man in the art concerning the use of ethylene acrylic acid concerns the same technical problem as the one resolved by the present Application.<br>
Similarly, none of them reveals the technical solution forming the subject of the present Application.<br>
Finally, none of them, nor mutual combinations of them, nor combinations with other documents, suggests the technical solution forming the subject of the present Application. One of the merits of the Applicant notably resides in the fact that he was able to observe that the following particular choices:<br>
-	the use of salts of ethylene acrylic acid to treat a natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate,<br>
-	the addition of a dispersing agent and/or grinding aid agent before and/or during the stage of treatment of the calcium carbonate by salts of ethylene acrylic acid (which is contrary to the teaching of the state of the technique),<br>
enable in a surprising manner the development of a process:<br>
-	which avoids the drawbacks relating to the use of stearic acid (a stage of disagglomeration and of addition of additional additives), which represents a financial gain,<br>
-	which enables aqueous suspensions of mineral matter with high dry extract to be obtained (notably greater than 65%) with a satisfactory rheology, and without the presence of agglomerates which would create residues on the filtration screens, representing a technical and economic interest,<br>
-	which enables the skilled man in the art to be given a process in which he can treat calcium carbonate both during a stage of grinding and of blending or concentration in an aqueous medium, which represents very great flexibility.<br>
8<br><br>
In addition, this process enables a natural and/or precipitated calcium carbonate to be obtained which is at once partially organophilic and partially hydrophilic, which is very surprising.<br>
It is notably very surprising that, if the salts of ethylene acrylic acid are added during or after the addition of dispersing agent, these salts do not influence in a negative fashion the rheological properties of the dispersions obtained: indeed, one succeeds surprisingly, using the process according to the invention, in obtaining high dry extracts (notably greater than 65%) with satisfactory rheological properties and without the formation of agglomerates.<br>
At the same time, it is very surprising that the dispersing agent (which is added before or during the introduction of the ethylene acrylic acid salts) does not prevent the interaction between the said salts and the surface of the calcium carbonate in order to make it organophilic: indeed, one succeeds surprisingly, using the process according to the invention, in manufacturing calcium carbonate particles which are dispersible in plastics.<br>
Finally, the Applicant wishes to indicate that he is familiar with French patent Application No. 04 07806, which has been filed but not yet published, and which therefore intervenes only as a novelty in order to assess the patentability of the present Application.<br>
In this respect, French patent Application No. 04 07806 describes a process of preparation of self-binding pigmentary particles, which are either dry or in aqueous suspension or dispersion, including the following stages:<br>
a)	forming one or more aqueous suspensions of at least one inorganic matter and introducing it or them into a mill with a view to stage c),<br>
b)	forming or taking one or more aqueous solutions or suspensions or emulsions of at least one binder and introducing it or them into a mill with a view to stage c),<br>
c)	co-grinding the aqueous suspension or suspensions obtained in stage a) with the aqueous solutions or suspensions or emulsions obtained in stage b) so as to obtain an aqueous suspension of self-binding pigmentary particles,<br>
d)	possibly co-grinding the aqueous suspension obtained in stage c) with one or more aqueous solutions or suspensions or emulsions of at least one binder,<br>
e)	possibly drying the aqueous suspension obtained in stage c) or in stage d).<br>
This process, as indicated in French patent Application No. 04 07806, spares the skilled man in the art from using a third constituent during the preparation of the aqueous suspensions containing the inorganic matter and the binders, and during the co-grinding stage: this therefore constitutes a fundamental difference with the present invention, which necessarily uses a dispersing agent and/or grinding aid agent before or during the stage of treatment of mineral matter by ethylene acrylic acid.<br>

The results demonstrate that the process according to the invention leads to suspensions of<br>
calcium carbonate treated with a salt of ethylene acrylic acid and a dispersing agent, having a<br>
high dry extract, and notably greater than 75%.<br>
In addition, this dry extract is greater than that obtained in the process according to the prior<br>
art, and the Brookfield™ viscosities measured at 25 °C and at. 100 revolutions/minute are<br>
lower than those obtained in the case of the prior art<br>
In addition, it was demonstrated that the grinding is as efficient with or without ethylene<br>
acrylic acid, by a comparison between tests No.la and 3.<br>
In addition, no example according to the invention presented a problem of creation of foam in<br>
the calcium carbonate suspension.<br>
Moreover, it was observed that the screen residues obtained in the case of the invention were<br>
completely negligible.<br>

A high-density polyethylene of the company BASELL™ POLYOLEFINS sold under the<br>
name HostalenTmGM9240 HT was introduced into a roll mill sold under the name Walzwerk<br>
150x400 of the company DR. COLLIN.<br>
After this, plates 2 and 4 mm in thickness were formed in a "Testing Platen Presses Type P"<br>
P300-P press of the company DR. COLLIN.<br>
Test No. 8<br>
This test illustrates the invention.<br>
The suspension of test No. 5 was dried with an MSD™ 100 pulveriser of the company<br>
NIRO™. A dry treated marble is obtained, the size of the particles of which is such that 88%<br>
by weight of them have a diameter of less than 2 µm.<br>
The treated and dry marble was then blended at 180°C with a high-density polyethylene of the<br>
company BASELL™ POLYOLEFINS sold under the name Hostalen™ GM 9240 HT in a roll<br>
mill sold under the name Walzwerk 150x400 of the company DR. COLLIN. The composition<br>
of the blend has equal masses of the treated product and of the high-density polyethylene.<br>
After this, plates 2 and 4 mm in thickness were formed in a "Testing Platen Presses Type P"<br>
P300-P press of the company DR. COLLIN.<br>
The traction resistances of the plates formed for tests No. 7 and 8 are equal respectively to<br>
23.9 N/mm2 and 24.2 N/mra2 according to norm DIN 53455.<br>
It is observed that the replacement of part of the polyethylene by the pigment according to the<br>
invention does not reduce the traction resistance.<br>
