COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
"PHARMACEUTICAL    COMPOSITIONS    COMPRISING    A    HMG    COA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
• The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and more particularly to a pharmaceutical composition containing (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(memylsulfonyl)ammo]pyriniidin-5-ylJ-(3R, 5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof (and referred to hereinafter as "the Agent"). In particular the sodium and calcium salts, and especially the calcium salt, bis[(E)-7-[4-(4- . fiuorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(memylsulfonyl)ammo]pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R, 5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acidjcalcium salt (shown as Formula I below).<br>
The Agent is disclosed as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) in European Patent Application, Publication No. 0521471 and in' Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, (1997), 5(2), 431-AAA and is useful in the treatment of ' hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidproteinemia and atherosclerosis.<br>
A problem associated with the Agent is that it is particularly sensitive to degradation under certain conditions. The major degradation products formed are the corresponding (3R, 5S) lactone (hereinafter referred to as "the lactone") and an oxidation product (hereinafter referred to as "B2") in which the hydroxy group adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond is oxidised to a ketone functionality. The potential for significant degradation of the agent makes it difficult to formulate and provide a pharmaceutical composition with acceptable storage life for a marketed product.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of certain 7-substituted-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid salts, which are HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, are disclosed in UK Patent 2 262 229, and that they are sensitive to pH degradation. These formulations require the presence of an alkaline medium (such as a carbonate or bicarbonate) capable of imparting a pH of at least 8 to an aqueous solution or dispersion of the composition.<br>
However, we have found that for the Agent it is not sufficient to improve stability by solely controlling pH in the formulation.. We have found that with the Agent stability is<br><br>
improved by selection of an inorganic salt to be added to the composition which contains one or more multivalent inorganic cations. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory we believe that the multivalent inorganic cation stabilises the structure of the Agent and makes it less susceptible to oxidation and/or lactonization. 15<br>
We present as a feature of the invention<br><br>
n<br>
20<br><br><br>
(1)	A pharmaceutical composition comprising the Agent as an active ingredient and an inorganic salt in which the cation is multivalent.<br>
(2)	The use of an inorganic salt in which the cation- is multivalent as a stabilising agent in a  pharmaceutical composition comprising the Agent.<br>

It will be appreciated that a particular excipient may act as both a binder and a filler, or as a binder, a filler and a disintegrant. Typically the combined amount of filler, binder and disintegrant comprises, for example, 70 to 90% by weight of the composition.<br>
Typically one or more lubricants will be present in an amount 0.5 to 3%, and especially 1 to 2% by weight.<br><br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, using standard techniques and manufacturing processes generally known in the art, for example by dry 0 blending the components. For example  the Agent and an inorganic salt in which, multivalent, one or more fillers, one or more binders and one or more disintegrate, as" wefl?as-other additional excipients if desired are blended together. The components of the blend prior to blending, or the blend itself, may be passed through a mesh screen, for example a 400-700 p.m mesh screen. A lubricant, which may also be screened, is then added to the blend and 5  blending continued until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. The mixture is then compressed into tablets. Alternatively, a wet granulation technique can be employed. For example, the Agent and an inorganic salt in which the cation is multivalent, one or more fillers, one or more binders and a portion of a disintegrant, as well as other additional excipients if desired, are blended together, for example by using a granulator, and the powder blend is granulated JO with a small volume of purified water.. The granulate is dried arid passed though a mill. The remainder of the disintegrant and a lubricant are added to the milled granulation and after<br><br><br><br>
blending the resultant homogeneous mixture is compressed into tablets. It will be appreciated that modifications of the dry blending and wet granulation techniques, including the order of addition of the components and their screening and blending prior to compression into tablets, may be carried out according to principles well known in the art.<br>

A tablet coating may then be applied, for example by spray-coating", with a water-based film coating formulation. The coating may comprise, for example, lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, triacetin, titanium dioxide and ferric oxides. Coating ingredient combinations are commercially available, such as those described in the Examples<br>
0  hereinafter. The coating may comprise, for example, 0.5 to 10% by weight of the tablet composition, particularly 1 to 6%, and preferably 2 to 3%.   Coatings containing ferric oxides are especially preferred as they reduce the rate of formation of photodegradation products of the Agent.<br>
5	Accordingly we present as a feature of the invention a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the Agent, the composition having a ferric oxide light protective coating.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention comprises a method of preparing a stabilised pharmaceutical composition which comprises admixing the Agent with an inorganic salt in ) which the cation is multivalent."
