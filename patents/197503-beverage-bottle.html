				<td>THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a beverage bottle, and more particularly to a synthetic resin bottle, which has a cylindrical body, dual chambers divided by a partition wall perpendicularly disposed in the cylindrical body, and a cup secured to the bottle spout member as a cap in a substantially liquid-tight relationship.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
As well known to those skilled in the art, aluminum cans and glass bottles are used and merchandized to contain drinks currently. However, because aluminum and glass are expensive materials, a synthetic resin is frequently employed as a material to mold beverage bottles all over the world.<br>
In Fig. 1, a conventional beverage bottle is illustrated. The bottle includes a generally cylindrical body member 1 and has a spout member 2 at the upper end of the body member 1. The spout member 2 has an external thread 3 on its outer periphery that can be engaged with a cooperative thread 5 inside of a cap 4. The spout member 2 also has an annular peripheral flange 6 outwardly extending from the underside of the external thread 3<br>
for stopping an excessive rotation of the cap 4. The annular peripheral flange 6 also may be used as an easy-to-grip handle by a user.<br>
However, the conventional beverage bottle has some problems as described below.<br>
One problem is that the bottle needs a separate cup to receive drinks poured out of the bottle by a user, which causes the user's inconvenience. Another problem is that the size of the cap of the bottle is relatively small, so that it is difficult to open the cap with the user's fingers. Another problem is that the bottle has a single chamber for storing a drink, which makes it impossible to contain two different<br>
liquids. <br>
In order to solve the problems, Korean Pat. Appln. No. 2000-28791 applied by this applicant discloses "beverage container with selective openers and dual storing chambers", in which the container has dual chambers divided by a partition wall, so as to make it possible to hold two different liquids. However, the configuration disclosed in the patent application is problematic, in that it can be applied to can type beverage containers, but cannot be applied to synthetic beverage containers that is most widely utilized currently.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a beverage bottle, which is provided with one or more chambers and a double-walled cap, thereby containing one or more drinks in the beverage bottle, and allowing its cap to serving as a cup as well as a cap so as to eliminate the inconvenience of carrying a cup during sports activities, tours or travels.<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a beverage bottle, comprising: a bottle body member having a cylindrical shape; a spout member positioned on the upper end of the bottle body member, the spout member including an external thread on its outer periphery and an annular peripheral flange outwardly extending from the underside of the external thread for stopping the excessive rotation of a cap, the annular peripheral flange being adapted to be used as an easy-to-grip handle by users; a double-walled cap provided with inner and outer walls, the inner wall having a cooperative thread therein for being engaged with the external thread of the spout member, the outer wall being formed to serve as a cup to receive a beverage poured out of the bottle body member; and a circumferential sealing strap adapted to be adhered around the entire circumference of the bottle body member in the region that the edge of the outer wall and the outer surface of the bottle body member are<br>
engaged, the sealing strap including a separation line placed in the longitudinal direction of the strap, whereby users can apply a shear stress to the separation line of the strap so as to tear the strap along the line and to separate the cap from the bottle body member. The body member is separated into an upper section and a lower section.<br>
In accordance with the present invention relates to A beverage bottle, comprising:<br>
a bottle body member having a cylindrical shape;<br>
a spout member positioned on an upper end of said bottle body member, the spout member having an external thread on its outer periphery and an annular peripheral flange outwardly extending from an underside of said external thread for stopping excessive rotation of a cap, te <br>
a double-walled cap provided with inner and outer walls, the inner wall having a cooperative thread therein for being engaged with said external thread of the spout member, the outer wall being formed to serve as a cup to receive a beverage poured out of said bottle body member; and<br>
a circumferential sealing strap adapted to be adhered around an entire<br>
circumference of the bottle body member in the region where an edge of the<br>
outer wall and an outer surface of the bottle body member are engaged, the<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTIOPN OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a partially sectional front view of a plastic bottle of the prior art;<br>
Fig.2 is an exploded perspective view of a beverage bottle with portions cut away, in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig.3 is a partially sectional front view showing the assembly of the beverage bottle of the first embodiment;<br>
Fig.4 is an exploded perspective view of a beverage bottle with portions cut away, in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Fig.5  is   a    partially     sectional    front      view      showing      the assembly of the beverage bottle of the second embodiment. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference now should be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components.<br>
First embodiment<br>
In the Figs. 1 and 2, a first embodiment of the beverage bottle of the invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, the bottle includes a cylindrical body member 1 and a spout member 2 on the upper end of the body member 1. The spout member 2 includes an external thread 3 on its outer periphery and an annular peripheral flange 6 outwardly extending from the underside of the external thread 3 for stopping the excessive rotation of a cap 4. The annular peripheral flange 6 is adapted to be used as an easy-to-grip handle by users.<br>
The beverage bottle has a double-walled cap that is provided with inner and outer walls 4a and 4b. The inner wall 4a has a cooperative thread 5 therein for being engaged with the external thread 3 of the spout member 2, and the outer wall 4b is formed to serve as a cup to receive a beverage poured out of the bottle body member 1.<br>
The beverage bottle also has a circumferential sealing strap 7 that is adapted to be adhered around the entire circumference of the bottle body member 1 in the region that the edge of the outer wall 4b and the outer surface of the bottle body member 1 are engaged. The sealing strap 7 includes a separation line 8 that is placed in the longitudinal direction of the strap 7. Thereby users can apply a shear stress to the separation line 8 of the strap 7 so as to tear the strap 7 along the line 8 and to separate the cap 4 from the bottle body member 1.<br>
Second embodiment<br>
In the Figs. 3 and 4, a second embodiment of the beverage bottle of the invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, the body member 1 is separated into an upper section la and a lower section 1b.<br>
The dual chambered body member 1 may be formed by an biaxial blow molding in which a preform having a wall may be expanded by an biaxial blowing process, so that the preform is biaxially expanded to form the upper section la and the lower section 1b respectively.<br>
Alternatively, the dual chambered body member 1 may be formed by bonding two half-bottle bodies that are symmetrically the same in shape respectively. The bonding of both flat bottom<br>
surfaces of the half bodies may be achieved through a supersonic wave bonding process or by an adhesive such as a urethane adhesive, a hot-melt adhesive (polyamides) or an acrylic adhesive (TGA) that may be cured by ultraviolet rays in a short exposure time without environmental pollution.<br>
Both caps 4 of the bottle may be identical for permitting simple and inexpensive construction.<br>
It is desirable that the one end cap 4 of the bottle has same diameter as that of the bottle body member 1 and flat bottom surface so that the bottle may have an increased stability when standing in an upright position.<br>
A comparison of Figs. 1 and 4 makes readily apparent the advantages of the present invention. The beverage bottle of the invention has a cup that is secured to the bottle spout member as a cap in a substantially liquid-tight fashion so that a user does not need a separate cup to receive drinks poured out of the bottle. The body member has dual chambers divided by a partition wall, so that the bottle may hold two different beverages. Customers can enjoy greatly enhanced flavor retention of one or more beverages. Finally, the beverage bottle of the invention is easily opened by simply twisting the cap 4 against the body member 1, wherein the separation line 8 along the strap 7 is parted to separate the cap 4 from the bottle body member 1.<br>
Although  the  preferred  embodiments  of  the  present<br>
invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
