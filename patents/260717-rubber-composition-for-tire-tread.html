				<td>RUBBER COMPOSITION FOR TIRE TREAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition for a tire tread.<br>
There have been problems that a tread part of a pneumatic tire easily generates heat in accordance with vehicle running and therefore grip performance is lowered under a high temperature condition.<br>
In order to solve these problems, it have been conventionally carried out to compound a resin having a high glass transition temperature to a rubber composition for a tire tread, and to compound an imidazole compound to a rubber composition for a tire tread, but the grip performance under a high temperature condition has not been able to be sufficiently improved.<br>
JP-A-2003-213045 discloses a rubber composition for a tire compounded with an organometallic compound such as magnesium methacrylate or zinc methacrylate. However, since crosslinking inhibition is caused by isolating methacrylic acid at kneading the organometallic compound, there has been a problem that the grip performance under a high temperature condition cannot be improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a rubber composition for a tire tread with which a tire improving grip performance under a high temperature condition can be prepared.<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition for a<br>
tire tread comprising (A) a diene rubber, (B) at least one kind of organometallic salt selected from the group consisting of magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, magnesium propionate and calcium propionate, and (C) a metallic compound.<br>
In the above-mentioned rubber composition for a tire tread, the organometallic salt (B) and the metallic compound (C) preferably have an identical metal ion.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present invention comprises (A) a diene rubber, (B) at least one kind of organometallic salt selected from the group consisting of magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, magnesium propionate and calcium propionate, and (C) a metallic compound.<br>
Examples of the diene rubber (A) are a natural rubber (NR), a styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), a butadiene rubber (BR), an isoprene rubber (IR), a butyl rubber, an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), and a chloroprene rubber (CR). Among these, the rubber for a tire tread is preferably SBR, NR or BR, and more preferably SBR from the viewpoints of having adequate strength and showing excellent abrasion resistance.<br>
The organometallic salt (B) is at least one selected from the group consisting of magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, magnesium propionate and calcium propionate. They do not contain a multiple bond such as a double bond as acrylate and methacrylate have. Since a multiple bond is not contained, unevenness of crosslinking can be suppressed and a crosslinking density can be improved. Among those,<br>
magnesium acetate or calcium acetate is preferable and magnesium acetate is more preferable from the viewpoint that an effect of improving tan 6 at a high temperature can be obtained.<br>
An amount of the organometallic salt (B) is preferably at least 0.1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a diene rubber, and more preferably at least 1 part by weight. When the amount of the organometallic salt (B) is less than 0.1 part by weight, an effect of compounding the organometallic salt (B) tends to be hardly obtained. The amount of the organometallic salt (B) is preferably at most 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber, and more preferably at most 10 parts by weight. When the amount of the organometallic salt (B) exceeds 20 parts by weight, processability of the rubber tends to be deteriorated.<br>
Examples of the metallic compound (C) are a metal oxide and a carbonic acid compound.<br>
When a metal oxide is used as the metallic compound (C), examples of the metal oxide are magnesium oxide and calcium oxide.<br>
When a carbonic acid compound is used as the metallic compound (C), examples of the carbonic acid compound are calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. The carbonic acid compound produces a metal oxide according to the following foTrrrula.<br>
CaCO3  CaO + CO2<br>
A metal oxide is particularly effective as the metallic compound (C) since it directly relates to equilibrium. The metallic compound (C) does not include the organometallic salt (B).<br>
The metallic compound (C) contains an ionic bond. Since loss can be generated (tan 6 is generated) by a higher temperature and large strain due to such an ionic bond having a bonding force stronger than that of a hydrogen bond (such as a bond between a nitrogen compound and acid), the grip performance at a high temperature can be improved. Further, change of a glass transition temperature of the rubber composition becomes small by compounding the metallic compound (C), and the danger of embrittlement fracture is lessened.<br>
An amount of the metallic compound (C) is preferably at least 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a diene rubber and more preferably at least 3 parts by weight. When the amount of the metallic compound (C) is less than 1 part by weight, an effect of compounding the organometallic salt (B) tends to be hardly obtained. The amount of the metallic compound (C) is preferably at most 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber, and more preferably at most 5 parts by weight. When the amount of the metallic compound (C) exceeds 10 parts by weight, the rubber becomes hard and abrasion appearance tends to be deteriorated.<br>
The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present invention can suppress generation of acid by containing both the organometallic salt (B) and the metallic compound (C). Thereby, crosslinking inhibition is reduced.<br>
For example, when magnesium acetate as the organometallic salt (B) and magnesium oxide as the metallic compound (C) are both compounded, the equilibrium represented by the following formula exists:<br>
Mg(CH3COO)2 + H20  2CH3COOH + MgO<br>
As cleared from the above-mentioned equilibrium formula, the equilibrium is easily transferred from the right to left because of the existence of MgO, decomposition of an ionic bond by heat and stimulation can be prevented, and tan 6 at a high temperature can be efficiently improved.<br>
It is particularly preferable that the metal ion of the organometallic salt (B) and that of the metallic compound (C) are identical. For example, when magnesium acetate is used as the organometallic salt (B), magnesium oxide having the identical metal ion is preferably used as the metallic compound (C).<br>
The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present invention can decrease the amount of a basic antioxidant such as an aromatic secondary amine antioxidant, amine-ketone antioxidant, benzimidazole antioxidant, and thiourea antioxidant, which are used to suppress acid neutralization by containing the organometallic salt (B) and the metallic compound (C) so as to suppress generation of acid. Since these antioxidants have been conventionally used by substituting an oil, a grip of a tire around at a low temperature has tended to be decreased. However, an amount to be used of a softening agent such as an oil can be increased by suppressing the generation of acid as in the present invention, thereby the grip of a tire around at a low temperature can be improved, and further, the grip of a tire around at a high temperature can be also improved.<br>
In the present invention, those generally used in the tire industry such as aroma oil can be used as a softening agent.<br>
The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present invention can be appropriately compounded with an additive generally used in the rubber industry, such as a reinforcing agent such as carbon black and silica, stearic acid, zinc oxide, a vulcanizing agent such as sulfur and a vulcanization accelerator, in addition to the diene rubber (A), the organometallic salt (B), the metallic compound (C) and a softening agent.<br>
A pneumatic tire is prepared by a conventional process by using the rubber composition for a tire tread of the present invention as the tire tread. Namely, the above-described rubber composition is processed by extrusion to the shape of a tire tread part at an unvulcanized stage, and is pasted together on a tire molding machine by a conventional process to mold an unvulcanized tire. The unvulcanized tire is heated and pressurized in a vulcanizer to obtain a pneumatic tire.<br>

EXAMPLES 1 and 2 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 and 2 (Preparation process of rubber samples of Examples   1  and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2)<br>
SBR, carbon black, an antioxidant 6C, an antioxidant 224, stearic acid, zinc oxide, aroma oil, an ionic compound and magnesium oxide were base-kneaded according to the compounding amounts shown in Table 1 until reaching 150°C for 3 minutes, and discharged at 150°C to obtain kneaded articles. Sulfur and a vulcanization accelerator were added to the kneaded articles, and the mixtures were kneaded by an open roll for about 5 minutes to obtain unvulcanized rubber compositions. Sheets were prepared with the obtained unvulcanized rubber compositions, and rubber samples of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were prepared by vulcanizing them by a specified mold at 170°C for 12 minutes. The following tests were<br>
carried out by using the obtained rubber samples. <degree of crosslinking><br>
The rubber samples were extracted with toluene.    A change ratio of volumes before and after extraction is called as SWELL.    It is indicated that the larger the measurement value is, the larger the unevenness of crosslinking is, which is unfavorable. (Viscoelasticity)<br>
Viscoelasticity (complex elastic modulus E' and loss coefficient, tan 6) at which 10 % initial strain was imparted and dynamic strain of 2 % was imparted at a frequency of 5 Hz at 100°C was measured by using a Viscoelasticity spectrometer manufactured by Iwamoto Seisakusyo K. K. It is indicated that the larger the tan 6 is, the larger the tire grip made is, and the grip performance is excellent. <tensile test><br>
A test was carried out using No.3 dumbbell test samples at 70°C according to the K6251 of JIS tensile test method, and the respective values were expressed by indices referring to the value of Comparative Example 1 as 100. It is indicated that the larger the M300 (stress at 300 % elongation) is, the more the abrasion resistance property is improved.<br>
(Preparation process of   tires of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2)<br>
Sheets were prepared with the unvulcanized rubber compositions obtained in the preparation process of the rubber samples of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, and cart tires with a size of 11 x 7.10-5 were prepared by vulcanizing the unvulcanized tires obtained by being pasted together in a specified shape at 170°C for<br>
12 minutes.<br>
The obtained cart tires were mounted on an automobile to carry out the following actual running evaluation. (Grip test)<br>
The above-described tires were mounted on a cart, which ran on a course of about 2 km per a circuit by 8 rounds to evaluate a grip feeling. The grip feeling was evaluated with five points as the maximum referring to the grip feeling of Comparative Example 1 as 3 points. The initial grip was measured at the first to fourth rounds, and the latter-half grip was measured at the fifth to eighth rounds. (Abrasion appearance)<br>
The above-described tires were mounted on a cart, and ran on a course of about 2 km per a circuit by 8 rounds to evaluate abrasion appearance. The abrasion appearance was relatively evaluated with five points as the maximum referring to the tire appearance of Comparative Example 1 as 3 points. Respective test results are shown in Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1 (Table Removed)<br>
According to the present invention, a rubber composition for a tire tread capable of exhibiting excellent grip performance under a high temperature condition can be provided by suppressing crosslinking inhibition caused by acid generated at kneading the organometallic salt (B) and the metallic compound (C).<br><br><br><br><br>
