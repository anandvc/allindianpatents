				<td>The invention relates to a pure air unit for the phramacy-,<br>
grocery- and bio-technical industry.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a modular pure<br>
air unit device for feeding pure air into clean rooms having<br>
phramaceutical, grocery and biotechnical product.<br>
It is known in the pharmacy- and bio-technical industry how<br>
to handle corresponding products outside a clean room of the<br>
category A and also in clean rooms of the categories B, C and<br>
D. Pure air is fed into these clean rooms through filters which<br>
are arranged in the ceiling of the corresponding clean room.The<br>
pure air is fed through channels of circulating air units which<br>
are connected to at least one external air device which is<br>
situated in the region outside the clean rooms, These pure air<br>
units have a cumbersome design due to the channel system for<br>
feeding fresh air and therefore require a corresponding<br>
installation space.<br>
It is the task of this invention to design the generic pure<br>
air unit in such a way that the fresh air can be fed reliably<br>
into the respective clean rooms with a simpler design and more<br>
compact measurements. This task is fulfilled in the generic pure<br>
air unit as per the features of the invention.<br>
In the pure air unit as per the invention, the fan, the<br>
filter and the heat transmitter are accommodated in a common<br>
housing . Therefore, cumbersome channels for feeding the fresh<br>
air or return guiding of the return air are no longer required.<br>
The fresh air flowing through the filter lands directly into the<br>
clean room, while the return air coming out of the clean room is<br>
directly fed to the heat transmitter. The pure air unit as per<br>
the invention is therefore is design-wise simpler and can be<br>
built without much complication. On account of the design as per<br>
the invention, the pure air unit designed as a modular unit has<br>
only small measurements, so that the pure air unit can also be<br>
installed in places where only small installation space is<br>
available.<br>
Further features of the invention can be obtained from the<br>
further claims, the description and the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention is described in more details on the basis of a<br>
few design examples shown in the drawings. The following are<br>

Fig. 8 The pure air unit as shown in fig. 7, in a view inclined from below.<br>
The pure air unit is meant for application in the pharmacy or grocedry industry or even in the area of<br>
bio-technology. The pure air unit is designed as a module and is used in the clean room category B, C<br>
and D. The pure air unit according to fig. 1 to 3 has a housing 1, in which a filter fan unit 2 and a heat<br>
transmitter 3 are accommodated beside one another In the design forms described below, the heat<br>
transmitter 3 is designed advantageously as radiator. The filter fan unit 2 has a fan 4 which sucks pure<br>
air from a fresh air chamber which is situated in the region between the fan 4 and a ceiling 6 of the<br>
housing 1 Below the fan 4 there is a filter 7 which is designed in the known fashion and through which<br>
the pure air flows into the clean room.<br>
The filter fan unit 2 is separated by a separating wall 8 from a room 9 housing the radiator 3. the<br>
separating wall 8 is provided with an opening 10 which joins the housing room 9 to the fresh air<br>
chamber 5.<br>
The filter 7 lies at a small distance above the fresh air screen 11, through which the fresh air enters the<br>
clean room. The radiator 3 is provided in the region above a return air screen 12, through which the<br>
return air flows to the radiator.<br>
In the design example shown, the housing 1 is cuboid-shaped. Of course, it could also have any other<br>
suitable shape. Ideally, the ceiling 6 and the side walls 13 to 16 connected at right angles to it are of<br>
metal. A sound insulation layer 17 is applied to the inner side of the ceiling 6<br>
The fan 4 is held against a plate 18 which, for example, has a quadratic outline (fig. 2) and at least on<br>
two opposite sides a sound insulation layer 19, 20 protrudes and is fastened on to the housing side wall<br>
14 and to the separating wall 8. The sound insulation layer 19 is provided on the inner side of the<br>
housing side wall and the opposite-lying sound insulation layer 20 is provided against the separating<br>
,wall 8 which stretches from the housing floor to the housing ceiling 6 between the housing walls 13,<br>
15 lying opposite to one another. The separating wall is ideally made of metal.<br>
As shown in fig. 3, the filter 7 is supported by a frame 21, whose frame sides have a somewhat L-<br>
shaped cross-section, on the lower arm 22 of the frame 21 in the assembling position lies the filter 7.<br>
Parallel to the frame arm angled inwards, the frame 21 has an upper frame arm 23, whose free end is<br>
inclined upwards and with which the frame 21 is fastened on to the inner side of the housing side wall<br>
13 to 15 and on to the separating wall 8.<br>
The filter lies at a distance below the fan 4, so that a flow space 25 lying between it and the filter gets<br>
created. The flow space 25 ensures that the pure air is fed uniformly over the entire face of the filter 7.<br>
On the underside of the fan 4, a diverting unit 26 is fixed. It is formed by a plane plate 27 which juts<br>
out on all side above the fan 4 and whose outer edge runs perpendicularly upwards. The pure air<br>
suctioned (in a method yet to be described) by the fan 4 lands up in the ring space 29 formed between<br>
the plate edge 28 and the fan 4, where the pure air flows upwards. As the plate edge 28 ends at a<br>
distance below the carrier plate 18, the pure air can exit out of the ring space 29 and reach the flow<br>
space 30 between the plate edge 28 and the sound insulation layers 19,20. Here the pure air flows into<br>
the flow space 25 into which the flow space 30 passes on. From the flow space 25 onwards the pure<br>
air flows through the filter 7 and reaches through the fresh air screen 11 into the clean room below it.<br>
The sound insulation layer 17 stretches over the entire inner side of the housing ceiling 6, so that it is<br>
also provided in the radiator housing room 9 (fig. 3). In the housing side wall 16 there is an opening<br>
31, to the outer side of which a fresh air connector 32 is joined, through which external air 33 can be<br>
supplied. The opening 31 is situated immediately after the ceiling-side sound insulation layer 17 and<br>
hence at a distance above the radiator 3. The external air 33 flows at right angles to the return air 34<br>
into the room 9, in which the external air 33 is mixed with the return air 34. The room 9 thus also<br>
forms a mixing chamber for the external air and the return air. From the room 9 the mixed air goes<br>
through the opening 10 of the separating wall 8 and reached the fresh air chamber 5 between the<br>
carrier plate 18 and the ceiling-side sound insulation layer 17.<br>
Through the housing ceiling 6 and the sound insulation layer 17, electrical lines 35 for the fan 4 as<br>
well as lines 36 for the radiator are guided.<br>
The separating wall 8 divides the housing 1 into two housing spaces, out of which the fan-side housing<br>
space is greater than the radiator-side housing space 9.<br>
- The fresh air screen 11 has fresh air openings arranged distributed over its surface, to which baffle<br>
plates 37 placed inclined and running parallel to one another are joined. They stretch inclined from the<br>
opening edge in the direction towards the housing space 9 for the radiator 3. In this way, the fresh air<br>
38 initially enters inclined into the clean room situated below it. On account of the baffle plate 37 the<br>
fresh air 38 flows away from the room 9 at an inclination, so that this fresh air does not immediately<br>
flow back again via the return air screen to the radiator.<br>
Even the return air screen 12 has opening arranged distributed over its surface, to which baffle plates<br>
are joined. They also similarly lie parallel and are inversely inclined towards the baffle plates 37 of the<br>
fresh air screenll.<br>
On using the pure air unit the filtered fresh air 38 flows through the fresh air screen 11 directly into the<br>
clean room. Thereafter it flows along with the return air 34 provided with the housed parts through the<br>
return air screen 12 to the radiator 3 through which it flows right through. Here the return air 34 is<br>
cooled. The radiator 3 lies horizontally somewhat at the height of the filter 7. In the radiator room 9<br>
the return air 34 flows upwards and goes through the opening 10 in the separating wall 8 into the fresh<br>
air chamber 5 above the fan 4. If required, external air 33 can be fed into the radiator room 9 via the<br>
fresh air connector 32. where the external air 33 gets mixed with the cooled return air 34. In this case,<br>
the air mixture enters through the opening 10 into the fresh air chamber 5. In the fresh air chamber 5,<br>
the return air flows through an opening 40 (fig. 1) provided in the carrier plate 18 into the fan 4. The<br>
carrier plate 18 locks the ring space 29 as well as the flow space 30 upwards against the fresh air<br>
chamber 5. The air coming out of the fan 4 goes into the ring space 29 where it is deflected upwards<br>
by the plate edge 28 running upwards. Through the flow space 30 surrounding the ring space 29 the<br>
fresh air then flows downwards into the flow space 25, which ensures that the fresh air is uniformly<br>
distributed over the inlet surface of the filter 7. During passing through of the fresh air 38 through the<br>
filter 7, the fresh air is purified and filtered in the known method before entering the clean room once<br>
again.<br>
Instead of the ring space 29, one can also provide only flow channels on both sides of the fan 4,<br>
running parallel to one another, which stretch between the housing side walls 13 and 15 In this case,<br>
the air coming out of the fan 4 flows via the plate edges 28 into the flow space 30.<br>
As, in the pure air unit, the fan 4, the filter 7 and the radiator 3 are accommodated in a common<br>
housing, a cumbersome channel system for feeding the return air is not required. The pure air unit is<br>
designed as a module which, for example, can be inserterd into an opening of a screen ceiling 41 Fig<br>
2 and 3 show the carrier rails 42 and 43 of the screen ceiling which cross each other at right-angles. It<br>
is however also possible to fix the module suspended against a structure-side ceiling and then join it<br>
on the clean room side to a suspended cover, for example made of module plates.<br>
In the design example shown in fig. 4, the module is designed symmetrically. The housing la has a<br>
quadratic outline structure. To each of two housing sides 14a, 16a lying opposite to one another within<br>
the housing la, a fan 4a is connected. Both the fans 4a lie at half the length of the housing side walls<br>
14a, 16a at the same height. They have the same design as the fan 4 as shown in fig. 1 to 3.<br>
Below each of the two fans 4a there is a filter 7a having a rectangular outline shape Conforming to the<br>
previous design form, the filter 7a stretch between the housing side walls 13a, 15a lying opposite to<br>
one another. Besides, the filters 7a stretch between the housing side walls 14a, 16a and the separating<br>
walls 8a lying parallel to them, which in turn stretch parallel to the housing side walls 14a, 16a<br>
between the housing side walls 13a, 15a. The separating walls 8a separate the fresh air chambers<br>
situated in the region above the the fans 4a from the radiator space 9a in which the radiator is<br>
accommodated. It is also similarly arranged horizontally in the installation position and stretches<br>
according to the previous design form betweeen the housing side walls 13a, 15a lying opposite to one<br>
another and running parallel to one another. Besides, the radiator 3a stretches between the separating<br>
walls 8a lying parallel to one another. Below the radiator 3a there is again the return air screen,<br>
through which the return air flows out of the clean room into the radiator space 9a. On entering<br>
through the radiator 3a, the return air is cooled and flows through the openings 10a prvided in the<br>
separating walls 8a into the fresh air chambers in the region above the fans 4a. The return air suctioned<br>
by the fans 4a can be deflected and guided in the same way, as already described on the basis of fig. 1<br>
to 3. Otherwise, this design form is exactly the same as the design example as shown in the fig. lto 3<br>
Fig. 5 shows a design form, in which the housing lb, corresponding to the design example shown in<br>
fig. 4, is divided through the separating walls 8b. Contrary to the previous design form, only a single<br>
fan 4b is provided, which is accommodated in the centre space of the housing lb, while in both the<br>
spaces joining it, a radiator 3b each is arranged Both the radiators 3b ideally have the same design and<br>
stretch between the housing side walls 13b, 15b lying opposite to one another, as well as between the<br>
housing side walls 14b, 16b and the separating walls 8b lying parallel to them. The fan 4b is placed<br>
centrically in the housing lb.<br>
The return air suctioned by the fan 4b flows out of the radiator spaces 9b through corresponding<br>
openings in the separating walls 8b into the central fresh air chamber which is situated in the region<br>
above the fan 4b In the region below the fan 4b there is the filter 7b which stretches between the<br>
housing side walls 13b, 15b lying opposite to one another, as well as between the separating walls 8b<br>
joining them at right-angles and which are parallel to one another. Otherwise, this design form is<br>
exactly the same as the design example as shown in fig. 1 to 3. On one of the housing side walls, a<br>
fresh air connector can be provided, in order to feed external air to the radiator space 9b. A suitable<br>
fresh air connector can also be provided in the design example as shown in fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the possibility of accommodating the radiator 3c not horizontally but in an inclined<br>
position within the radiator space 9c. This inclined position has the advantage that the radiator space<br>
can be kept very narrow, so that even the corresponding housing lc has small outer measurements.<br>
The cooling effect is not hampered by the inclined position of the radiator 3c.<br>
The inclined positioned radiator 13 is fixed with holder rails 44, 45 on to the housing floor, as well as<br>
to the housing side wall. Such an inclined-arranged radiator can be provided in the case of the design<br>
examples described before, so that the corresponding modules would have small measurements.<br>
In a further (not shown) deisgn form, the fan is situated in the region above the radiator. In this case,<br>
the return air flows through the return air screen and through the radiator before it reaches the fan<br>
situated above it. From there the air is deflected to the filters which stretch in the region beside the<br>
radiator above fresh air screens. The radiator is ideally place centrally and separated from the filters by<br>
separating walls, so that in any case the return air must flow through the radiator and the fan before<br>
reaching the filters,<br>
In the design form as shown in fig. 7 and 8, the radiator is situated in the space 9d and a prefilter is<br>
pre-connected to it. It sits in a flow channel 60 for the return air 34. The filter-fan-unit 2 is<br>
inserted into the housing Id adjacent to the radiator 3d and has the fan 4d which is suspended on<br>
the plate 18d. Corresponding to the design form as shown in fig. 1 to 3, sound insulation layers 19d,<br>
20d are provided, which stretch starting from the filter 7d upto the height of the plate 18d.<br>
At a small distance below the fan 4d the deflecting unit is provided, which ideally also should be made<br>
of sound insulation material. The air suctioned out of the fresh air chamber 5d then goes downwards<br>
out of the fan 4d and is deflected sideways at the deflecting unit 26d. This way the air first lands up in<br>
the flow space 30d and subsequently in the flow space 25d. The flow space 30d is designed as ring<br>
space and lies in the region between the fan 4d or the deflecting unit 26d and the sound insulation<br>
layers 19d, 20d. The flow space 25d is restricted upwards by the deflecting unit 26d. From here<br>
onwards the air flows through the filter 7d downwards to the exit (to be described), through which<br>
reaches the clean room situated below.<br>
The fan 4d, the sound insulation layers 19d, 20d, the deflecting unit 26d and the filter 7d form an<br>
assembly unit 47 which is inserted into the housing Id of the pure air unit. The assembly unit 47 has a<br>
housing 48 along whose side walls the sound insulation layers 19d, 20d lie. The housing 48 is closed<br>
below by the filter 7d. On top the housing 48 is closed by sections of the side walls inclined inwards at<br>
right-angles and the plate 18d fixed on them. The assembly unit 47 can be pre-mounted and easily<br>
inserted into the housing 1d of the pure air unit.<br>
The housing 1d of the pure air unit sits on the installation frame 49, with which the unit can be placed<br>
on the screen ceiling 41 or even fixed suspended against a construction-side ceiling, as explained on<br>
the basis of the design form shown in fig. 1 to 3.<br>
The fresh air connector 32d is provided against the side wall 14d of the housing 1d. In this way, the<br>
fresh air connector 32d is situated on the side of the filter-fan-unit 2 which is away from the radiator<br>
3d. this arrangement has the advantage that the air flowing through the radiator 3d into the fresh air<br>
chamber 5d, as well as the external air fed through the fresh air connector 32d get symmetrically<br>
suctioned from the fan 4d into the fresh air chamber 5d.<br>
As explained on the basis of fig. 1 to 3, the return air 34 flows via the radiator 3d into the space 9d and<br>
through the opening 10d goes into the fresh air chamber 5d. The air coming out of the fan 4d is<br>
deflected radially outwards at the delfecting unit 26d and flows through the flow space 30d into the<br>
flow space 25d, and from there through the filter 7d. The flow space 25d ensures that the fresh air is<br>
distributed uniformly over the inlet surface of the filter 7d. While passing through the filter 7d the<br>
fresh air is purified and filtered in the know method before entering the clean room.<br>
On the side wall 16d of the housing 1d, in the upper edge region, there is a thermostatic regulating<br>
valve 50 with which the radiator 3d can be regulated.<br>
Below the prefilter 46, in the space 9d there is a measuring stud 51, to which a further measuring<br>
stud 53 is connected by a measuring line 52; the additional measuring stud is placed in the region<br>
beside the fan 4d in the flow space 30d. Through this measuring stud 53, with the help of a<br>
measuring sensor connected to the measuring stud 51, the pressure in the flow space 30d can be<br>
measured. Besides, the pressure below the filter 7d can be determined with the help of a further (not<br>
shown) sensor. From the pressure difference, once can get inferences regarding the load on the filter<br>
7d. In this way one can find out, when the filter 7d has to be cleaned and/or replaced. With both the<br>
measuring studs 51 and 53, it is also possible to determine the particle concentration in the flow path<br>
of the air before the filter 7d.<br>
Particularly while using the pure air unit in the pharmacy industry, one can thus check and monitor the<br>
integrity of the air filter 7d.<br>
In the region below the prefilter 46 there is a temperature feeler 54 in the flow channel 60, which acts<br>
on the thermostatic regulating valve 50. Instead of the thermostatic regulating valve, an<br>
electrical or electromotoric regulating valve can also be used. A further temperature feeler can<br>
be installed in the flow channel 60, with which the room temperature can be determined.<br>
The wall 16d of the housing 1d is provided with a connector 55 through which, if required, the entire<br>
or a part of the return air can be fed to a continuous air plant which is post-connected (not shown).<br>
The filtered and cooled fresh air 38 exits turbulantly on all sides into the clean room. It distributes<br>
itself in the clean room and is suctioned out of the clean room through the return air screen 12d and is<br>
cooled again by the heat exchanger 3d.<br>
As shown in fig. 8, the return air screen is surrounded on three sides by the fresh air screen lid. The<br>
fresh air screen lid has a U-shape and is provided with guide plates, through which the pure air<br>
flowing out is blown into the clean room. The guide plates 37d in the individual regions of the fresh<br>
air screen 1 1d are set in such a way that the pure air flows in different directions. In fig. 8, the flow-out<br>
directions of the pure air are marked by arrows. The guide plates are accordingly set inclined, so that<br>
the fresh air 38 exits inclined on to the respective adjacent edge of the housing Id.<br>
As explained on the basis of the design form shown in fig. 1 to 3, even the return air screen 12d has<br>
the inclined-lying guide plates. These guide plates can be dropped even in the previous design<br>
forms. As the return air screen 12d is situated between two sections of the fresh air screen 1 1d (fig. 8),<br>
there is a box 56 within the pure air unit in the region above the return air screen 12d, which in<br>
appearance has the same outline structure as the return air screen 12d. This box has an inclined wall 57<br>
which stretches inclined downwards. The width of this wall 57, measured perpendicular to the sign<br>
level as shown in fig. 7, conforms to the corresponding width of the return air screen 12d. To this wall<br>
side walls are joined, which stretch vertically downwards and along the logitudinal edges 58,59 (fig.8)<br>
of the return air screen 12d. In this way, the region above the return air screen 12d is flow-technically<br>
separated from the adjacent regions of the fresh air screen lid, so that the return air entering the<br>
housing 1d through the return air screen does not get mixed with the fresh air 38. At the inclined wall<br>
57 a part of or the eintire return air is deflected to the prefilter 46, which protects the air filter 7d from<br>
excessive pollution.<br>
The described pure air units are small, modular units which can be excellently applied in the fields of<br>
pharmacy, grocery and bio-technology. These modules are self-sufficient units, so that a complicated<br>
channel system for feeding the return air is not necesssary. The inner side of the module is smooth,<br>
which not only ensures smooth flow, but also the module can be easily cleaned. The temperature<br>
regulation as well as the flow volume regulation of the module can ideally take place witha bus<br>
system, like a LON. The modules can be easily mounted the the required points within the clean<br>
rooms.<br>
